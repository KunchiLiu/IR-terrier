	<brief_summary>In develop country , neonatal death birth asphyxia major problem . This study conduct several country determine combine Neonatal Resuscitation Program/Essential Newborn Care Program compare new World Health Organization ( WHO ) basic perinatal care education health care provider ( Essential Newborn Care Program ) result reduced mortality due perinatal asphyxia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Birth asphyxia ( define `` failure initiate sustain breathe birth '' ) identify WHO frequent cause early death worldwide , account 20 % neonatal mortality . Although prompt resuscitation birth prevent many death reduce disability survivor birth asphyxia , WHO conclude resuscitation often initiate method use inadequate wrong . The Neonatal Resuscitation Program ( NRP ) universally accept developed world limit dissemination many develop country . The primary hypothesis randomize control trial implementation combine Neonatal Resuscitation Program/WHO Essential Newborn Care ( ENC ) Program , compare basic neonatal care education health care provider ( ENC ) result reduce neonatal 7 day mortality . The study design include education training personnel community level implementation NRP intervention assure validity , accuracy , precision estimate treatment effect . The primary hypothesis implementation NRP educational program result decrease neonatal mortality . The primary outcome decrease cause early ( 7 day ) neonatal mortality , mortality due cause , NRP train community compare non-NRP trained community . Secondary outcome include early ( 7 day ) neonatal mortality associate perinatal asphyxia , mortality hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) 7 day , need advanced resuscitation , Apgar score 5 minute well provider ' self-efficacy , knowledge , competence , performance neonatal resuscitation . This cluster randomize trial performed community Global Network ( GN ) sit . One half community randomize Early Training Intervention NRP ; half randomize Late Training Intervention . Data collection obtain baseline group order establish baseline data include neonatal mortality asphyxia . Following baseline data collection period , train health care provider WHO Integrated Management Pregnancy Childbirth : Pregnancy , Postpartum , Newborn Care Guide Essential Practice ( 2003 ) : Essential Newborn Care Program ( ENC ) perform use train-the-trainer system . Following training , community randomize Early Late Training Intervention ENC . Initially , Early Training Intervention sit program train-the-trainers NRP . Following 12-month period intervention ( NRP vs. control ) , provider Late Training Intervention sit train NRP . Based early ( first 7 day birth ) neonatal mortality data collect preparation protocol , estimate 25 neonatal deaths/1000 live birth . The trial design identify relative risk reduction least 20 % ( absolute risk reduction 5 % 5/1000 live birth , 25/1000 20/1000 live birth ) treatment group compare control group . The sample size necessary 20 % relative risk reduction least 32 community average number birth &gt; 500 per year ; however , plan randomize least 40 community account potential drop-out . The proposed enrollment period randomize intervention last one year .</detailed_description>
