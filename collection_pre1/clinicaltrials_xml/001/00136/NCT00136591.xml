	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Velcade™ Subjects With Relapsed Refractory Follicular B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , sequential , international , multicentric , 2-arm , non-comparative , open-label , 2-stage clinical study determine disease response rate therapy Velcade™ subject relapse refractory follicular B-cell lymphoma ( FLL ) . Qualitative comparison 2 treatment arm base safety , efficacy dose convenience make order recommend dose schedule clinical study . It anticipate approximatively 120 subject enrol achieve require 110 evaluable subject , 55 treatment arm . Patients receive amount Velcade™ evaluable . Subjects evaluable response replace . A central randomization use study . Subjects randomize stratified factor prior therapy ( 1 2 versus &gt; 2 ) time progression ( TPP ) last give anti-neoplastic therapy ( ≤ 12 month versus &gt; 12 month ) . The eligible subject randomize either Treatment Arm A Treatment Arm B 1:1 ratio : - Subjects randomize Treatment Arm A receive 1.5 mg/m² Velcade™ administer biweekly Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 21-day cycle . Patients receive 8 cycle . The dose Velcade™ receive schedule A 48 mg/m² 24 week . - Subjects randomize Treatment Arm B receive 1.6 mg/m² Velcade™ administer weekly Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 35-day cycle . Patients receive 6 cycle . The dose Velcade™ receive schedule B 38.4 mg/m² 30 week . Two additional cycle may administer patient show improvement PR 8 6 cycle arm A B , respectively . Study drug dose schedule reduction toxicity allow study . A two stage interim analysis conduct treatment arm determine whether either 2 treatment lacks sufficient efficacy . The final analysis conduct subject opportunity complete 30 day post-treatment evaluation visit . All data visit point use final analysis , include data follow-up visit occur . Patients recruit approximately 2 year follow data available final analysis . The total duration study expect 5 year .</detailed_description>
