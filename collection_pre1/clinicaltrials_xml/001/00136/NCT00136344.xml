	<brief_summary>Cataract important cause visual impairment decrease mobility elderly . While surgery usually successful , also responsible permanent loss vision 0.1 % patient due severe post-operative infection ( endophthalmitis ) . Because risk , surgery typically perform one eye time leave patient monocular cataract cause considerable visual impairment reduction mobility quality life . A second operation require often take place one year later . It known present whether post-operative complication endophthalmitis prevent perioperative use antibiotic . This randomise study ( mask placebo-controlled topical levofloxacin unmasked intracameral injection cefuroxime ) set test 4 group , 8,750 cataract surgery patient , either topical antibiotic ( levofloxacin ) perioperatively intraocular ( intracameral ) injection antibiotic ( cefuroxime ) end phacoemulsification cataract surgery combination provide effective prophylaxis post-operative infection ( endophthalmitis ) compare control perioperative antibiotic use . The result provide scientific basis prophylaxis infection ( endophthalmitis ) follow cataract surgery Europe well accurate figure incidence endophthalmitis follow phacoemulsification cataract surgery Europe first time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Antibiotic Prophylaxis Endophthalmitis Following Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cataract extraction intra-ocular lens implantation commonly perform surgical procedure elderly population Europe . The frequency vary different European Union ( EU ) country involve 2 7 per 1000 population per annum . A population ever-increasing proportion elderly advancing figure number require surgery expect increase 70 % 2006 . While technical advance ( phacoemulsification ) enhance efficacy procedure , possibility serious post-operative infection loss vision remain important unsolved problem . In absence scientific evidence , European Society Cataract Refractive Surgeons ( ESCRS ) wish determine whether one currently develop method deliver antibiotic intraocularly Sweden benefit compare surgery without use perioperative antibiotic , currently practise many European centre , use frequent application topical antibiotic drop perioperatively . The ESCRS also wish ass possible risk factor later endophthalmitis . This study require four group 8,750 patient - 35,000 - demonstrate reduction currently report rate endophthalmitis ( approximately 0.3 % ) patient intraocular antibiotic use , use subconjunctival route . Other study use intraocular vancomycin report result low 0.05 % , study standardise controlled result anecdotal . In addition , vancomycin use routine prophylaxis use antibiotic 'last resort ' . This multi-centre randomise study involve 24 operate unit 8 EU country ( Austria , Belgium , England , Germany , Italy , Poland , Portugal Spain ) Turkey . Results 8,750 patient receive intracameral injection antibiotic ( cefuroxime ) end surgery compare 8,750 patient receive topical antibiotic ( levofloxacin ) prophylaxis end surgery , 8,750 patient receive combination 8,750 patient receive neither regime ; addition , patient receive povidone iodine antiseptic prophylaxis prior surgery post-operative levofloxacin day 1 6 prevent wound infection . This group size sufficiently large ensure least 80 % statistical power detect reduction incidence 0.25 % 0.08 % use 5 % significance level test . Surgical data patient collect directly computer base within operate theatre transmit central server Glasgow ( University Strathclyde ) . Follow-up data presence absence endophthalmitis collect patient post-operative visit similarly record computer transmission central server . Sophisticated technique use check data upload .</detailed_description>
