	<brief_summary>This study men prostate cancer spread outside prostate gland longer respond hormone removal therapy . This study design determine new drug combination help control cancer . The medicine use , docetaxel diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) , give patient prostate cancer drug demonstrate activity prostate cancer , either use alone combination . The objective study determine effect drug combination prostate cancer response disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Diethylstilbestrol Treatment Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm phase II trial docetaxel diethylstilbestrol patient symptomatic stage D3 androgen independent prostate cancer . Patients receive docetaxel weekly 10 cycle ( cycle consist treatment 3 week every 4 ) DES daily 40 week evidence disease progression , whichever occur first . Patients follow determine PSA objective response . Additional endpoint include time progression , disease specific survival overall survival . Disease progression define 2 consecutive increase PSA and/or tumor growth evidence examination radiologic evaluation . Other secondary objective determine toxicity , impact quality life regimen .</detailed_description>

Prior therapy medical surgical castration evidence castrate level testosterone Discontinuation nonsteroidal antiandrogens 6 week prior evaluation progression . It requirement nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy use prior enrollment . Androgen independent disease define one follow androgen ablation withdrawal nonsteroidal antiandrogen initiate ( &gt; 6 week discontinuation ) : PSA must great 5 ng/ml increase demonstrate two consecutive increase PSA level 5 ng/ml . Each PSA measurement must take least one week apart . Increase measurable disease within one month enrollment Worsening bone scan abnormality within two month enrollment great four month since initiation luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist . Performance status &lt; 3 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale . Patients must inform investigational nature study sign inform consent form . Life expectancy must &gt; = 3 month . Laboratory value must follow : White blood cell count : &gt; = 3,000/mm3 Absolute granulocyte count : &gt; = 1,500/mm3 Platelets : &gt; = 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin : &gt; = 8g/dL Serum creatinine : &lt; = 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST : &lt; = 2 x ULN ALT : &lt; = 2 x ULN Serum calcium : &lt; = ULN Total bilirubin : &lt; = 1.5 x ULN Patient must willing consent use effective contraception treatment three month completion therapy . Patients meet follow criterion eligible trial : Patients receive PCSPES , DES , mitoxantrone docetaxel therapy . Patients receive prior chemotherapy type receive investigational therapy .
