	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis urothelial carcinoma ( TCC Squamous ) either metastatic locally recurrent curable surgery radiation therapy . All patient must tissue either primary metastatic site test HER2 status determination . Patients Her2 negative tumor eligible treatment protocol . All patient must blood sample drawn HER2 serologic test . If available tissue primary tumor HER2 negative serum negative , qualify study biopsy metastatic site do patient eligible ONLY demonstrate HER2 overexpression . Patients may receive prior systemic chemotherapy metastatic disease . Patients may receive adjuvant chemotherapy complete least 6 month prior begin protocol treatment . Patients may cardiac disease must adequate cardiac function ( ejection fraction &gt; 50 % high low limit institutional normal ) determine MUGA scan 2D echocardiogram within 4 week registration , evidence symptomatic coronary artery disease ( baseline EKG must show active ischemia ) . Patients must history congestive heart failure . If patient receive prior radiation therapy , disease must present outside radiate field least 4 week must elapse since discontinuation therapy . Pregnant lactate woman may participate . HIV positive patient may participate . This avoid additional complication immune suppression HIV infection may cause due intense nature chemotherapy trial .</criteria>
