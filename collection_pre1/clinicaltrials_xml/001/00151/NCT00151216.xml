	<brief_summary>The aim study treat sign symptom late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ( LINCL ) , fatal inherited disease brain . This accomplish use delivery gene ( method call gene transfer ) administer brain experimental drug call AAV2CUhCLN2 , gene transfer vector .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Gene Transfer Vector Children With Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ( LINCL ) fatal childhood neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease know therapy . There estimate 200 300 child USA one time disease . LINCL genetic disease result mutation CLN2 gene . The CLN2 gene encodes protein tripeptidyl peptidase-I ( TPP-I ) absent/deficient child LINCL . This absence/deficiency TPP-I result lysosomal storage subsequent cell death ( especially neuron ) . The child LINCL chronically ill , progressive CNS disorder invariably result death , typically age 8 12 . This clinical study evaluate concept persistent expression normal CLN2 cDNA CNS result production sufficient amount TPP-I prevent loss neuron , hence limit disease progression . To assess concept , adeno-associated virus vector encode normal human CLN2 gene ( AAV2CUhCLN2 ) use vehicle deliver express human CLN2 cDNA brain child LINCL . The propose study include 11 individual divide two part . Group A , study first , include 5 individual severe form disease . Group B trial include 6 individual moderate form disease . Following direct intracranial administration vector , neurological assessment use LINCL clinical rating scale magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance spectroscopy assessment CNS region vector administration . The data generate help evaluate two hypothesis : ( 1 ) safe carry direct intracranial administration AAV2CUhCLN2 vector CNS individual LINCL ; ( 2 ) administration AAV2CUhCLN2 vector slow halt progression disease central nervous system .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A definitive diagnosis late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis Between age 3 18 year Not previously participate gene transfer study LINCL . Parents study participant must agree comply good faith condition study , include attend required baseline followup assessment . Both parent legal guardian must give consent child 's participation research study . Other significant medical neurological condition may disqualify patient participation study , particularly would create unacceptable operative risk risk receive AAV2CUhCLN2 vector . Individuals heart disease would risk anesthesia . History hemorrhage major risk factor hemorrhage Concurrent participation FDA approve Investigational New Drug clinical protocol allow , although Principal Investigator work doctor accommodate specific request ( e.g. , study nutritional supplement probably would disqualification ) . Individuals ( 1 ) heart pacemaker and/or related implant , ( 2 ) metal fragment/chip eye site , ( 3 ) aneurysm clip brain , ( 4 ) metallic inner ear implant .</criteria>
