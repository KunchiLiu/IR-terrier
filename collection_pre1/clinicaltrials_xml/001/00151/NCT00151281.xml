	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : Evaluate clinical activity RT-PEPC combination regimen ( rituximab , thalidomide , prednisone , etoposide , procarbazine , cyclophosphamide ) patient relapse mantle cell lymphoma . Specifically , response rate ( RR ) time disease progression ( TTP ) assess . Secondary Objectives : 1 . Assess toxicity profile RT-PEPC treatment patient relapse mantle cell lymphoma . 2 . Prospectively characterize angiogenic profile patient mantle cell lymphoma treatment RT-PEPC . The dynamic angiogenic profile correlate clinical response RT-PEPC therapy . 3 . Assess quality life patient receive RT-PEPC treatment</brief_summary>
