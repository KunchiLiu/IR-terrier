	<brief_summary>In separate protocol Department Genetic Medicine proposing carry study use gene transfer treat central nervous system ( CNS ) manifestation late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ( LINCL ) , fatal , rare , recessive disorder ( CNS ) child . In context little know genotype - phenotype correlation LINCL , referral far exceed number ( n=11 ) child enter gene transfer protocol , propose capitalize unique opportunity evaluate disorder separate study . In context , aim protocol study genotype - phenotype correlation CNS manifestation late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis . This accomplish compare genotype neurologic assessment , LINCL clinical rating scale ; magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopic ( MRS ) assessments CNS ; routine clinical evaluation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genotype - Phenotype Correlations LINCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This propose clinical protocol design ass genotype - phenotype correlation LINCL , include preliminary assessment regard genotype - phenotype correlation progressive CNS deterioration inherent disorder . The trial include primary endpoint neurological assessment include LINCL clinical rating scale parental evaluation ; secondary endpoint magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopic ( MRS ) assessments CNS . The study carry child diagnose LINCL stage . The stag base modification scale Steinfeld et al ( Steinfeld , 2002 ) . The study anticipate total n=30 child assess period 18 month . Of , anticipate approximately two-thirds enter propose gene therapy protocol thus approximately n=20 available study reassess 1 year . Thus , anticipate able capture one-time genotype - phenotype snapshot n=30 , 1 year genotype - phenotype progression assessment n=20 .</detailed_description>
