	<brief_summary>Purpose : This clinical trail combine chemotherapy drug , Estramustine Vinorelbine ( Navelbine ) , intermittent therapy strategy base PSA response treatment hormone refractory prostate cancer . The investigator determine tolerable dose ( oral ) vinorelbine combination ( oral ) estramustine , evaluate efficacy treatment patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hormone Refractory prostate cancer refers advance disease patient long respond conventional hormonal treatment . When hormone therapy longer successful , chemotherapy treatment option . However , current single-agent treatment show limited benefit . In clinical trial , investigator evaluate effectiveness combine two chemotherapy drug , Estramustine Vinorelbine ( Navelbine ) , treatment hormone refractory prostate cancer . Estramustine use treatment prostate cancer many year . Vinorelbine show activity prostate cancer . In addition , effect treatment quality life patient evaluate measured use FACT-P .</detailed_description>
