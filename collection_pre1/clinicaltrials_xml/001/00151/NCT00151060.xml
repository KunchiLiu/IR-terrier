	<brief_summary>Hormonal therapy standard treatment prostate cancer spread area body . Despite high initial response rate hormonal therapy , vast majority men develop cancer longer responsive hormone deprivation . The average time hormonal therapy effective 18 month . Chemotherapy combination treat disease long respond hormonal therapy develop , treatment curative . One combination estramustine , etoposide paclitaxel . In men far advanced disease , 60 % decrease PSA ( Prostate Specific Antigen ) shrinkage tumor treatment chemotherapy . Despite , men develop disease progression require additional treatment . One possible way make chemotherapy effective give number tumor cell small , number cell kill low level . One situation true man respond hormonal therapy tumor smallest size . This study test whether addition chemotherapy time prolong time cancer become unresponsive hormonal therapy .</brief_summary>
