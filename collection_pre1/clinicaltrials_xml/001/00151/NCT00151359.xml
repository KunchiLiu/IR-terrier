	<brief_summary>Our research show pressure sensation sole foot ( plantar mechanoreceptors ) play important role control several key aspect balance reaction , particularly compensatory step . As result , age-related loss plantar pressure sensation , common , lead impair control reaction . However , show possible compensate balance impairment result loss sensation use special footwear insole facilitate sensation perimeter sole . To date , demonstrate feasibility approach laboratory study , obtain U.S. patent design concept . However , remain determined whether benefit footwear persist long term , whether habituation effect . Also , need determine whether practical problem associate wear footwear , e.g . due discomfort irritation skin .</brief_summary>
