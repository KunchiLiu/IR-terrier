	<brief_title>Stepping Up Health : Feedback Promote Physical Activity Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective # 1 : To develop test computer program automatically collect enhanced pedometer data , record data format suitable statistical analysis , generate personally tailored motivational web page distribute e-mail reminder message encourage participant log his/her website . Objective # 2 : To compare total daily step people diabetes randomize two different 6-week pedometer web-based walking intervention . The two intervention differ emphasis goal set feedback . Group 1 : Emphasizes 10-minute minimum duration physical activity bout Group 2 : Emphasizes total daily step without regard duration walk bout Objective # 3 : To compare step accumulate walk bout last least 10 minute two group participant diabetes . Objective # 4 : To assess feasibility , cost , dropout rate participant satisfaction pedometer web-based walk intervention participant diabetes . This study consist three phase . Phase I development web-based interactive system include data downloading tailor message . Phase II usability test phase 8 participant recruit wear pedometer , interact web-based system give feedback final development . The Usability phase occur exactly like Phase III outline except participant assign study group rather randomize , on-study 2 week - one week enrollment phase one week intervention phase . At end intervention week , complete post survey instead complete feasibility/usability survey meet study staff help define improvement adjustment Phase III trial . To maximize Usability Phase , feedback receive first four participant incorporate website last four participant enrol . The final phase ( Phase III ) include total 40 men woman age &gt; 18 year old , Type II Diabetes interest start walk program . If meet eligibility sign consent form enroll randomize control trial compare two similar intervention promote walk . Both intervention 6-week pedometer-based intervention rely step-count feedback motivate participant increase walk . Tailored behavioral , informational motivational message deliver website enhanced pedometer work participant automatically upload time-stamped step count data central computer . One intervention , `` 10 minute bout '' intervention emphasize bout walk last least 10 minute least moderate intensity .
