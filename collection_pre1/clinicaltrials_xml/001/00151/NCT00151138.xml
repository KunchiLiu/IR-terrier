	<brief_title>Cognitive/Cerebrovascular Consequences HTN Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project examine neuropsychological status , peripheral blood flow , structural cortical ( magnetic resonance imaging , MRI ) functional cortical blood flow ( quantitative positron emission tomography , PET ) status previously unmedicated hypertensive . These individual medicate one year one two effective blood pressure medication . Our hypothesis angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor , beta-blocker normalize cerebral blood flow possibly , cognitive function . This hypothesis test repetition initial examination completion one year treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subject 35 65 year age , must diastolic BP 90 109 mm Hg , systolic BP 140 179 mm Hg , . Eligibility base upon reading take two screen visit . For rest BP determination , eat , smoking , drink heavy physical activity proscribe 1 hour prior , drink caffeinated beverage 2 hour prior . Systolic diastolic ( 5th phase ) BP determine twice separate 2 minute use 23 mm Hg/sec deflation rate . Before reading , 60 rest pulse obtain . Two reading two session average . All measurement obtain individual certify BP measurement Department Epidemiology Graduate School Public Health . Potential subject must either prior pharmacologic treatment hypertension minimal lifetime exposure . The latter define 6 month blood pressure medication within past 5 year . No blood pressure medication take 6 month precede study enrollment . To establish medical eligibility screen secondary cause hypertension , subject provide medical history standard blood chemistry determine screen occult renal failure primary hyperaldosteronism . All woman postmenopausal test ( urine specimen ) ensure absence pregnancy . To ensure ability complete behavioral assessment , subject must least 8th grade education immigrant must speak English primary language least five year . Exclusion Criteria . Exclusion criterion include current use cardiovascular psychotropic medication , contraindication use ACE inhibitor beta blocker ( e.g. , prior adverse reaction chronic obstructive lung disease , include asthma ) . Individuals rest blood pressure great SBP &gt; 180 mmHg /or DBP &gt; 110 excluded individual prior serious adverse reaction allergy beta blocker angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitor . We exclude individual target organ damage ( history myocardial infarction , angioplasty , bypass surgery , congestive heart failure , stroke , carotid endarterectomy ) , angina pectoris ( determine Rose questionnaire ) , history insulindependent diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency ( serum creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dl ) . Secondary hypertension , base upon know clinically suspect renal artery stenosis , primary hyperaldosteronism , untreated thyroid disorder , heavy alcohol consumption ( 24 standard drink per week ) , consistent use illegal drug ( example , crack/cocaine use month ) pheochromocytoma , ground exclusion . A standard 30 g per day ( Klatsky , 2003 ) seem acceptance level alcohol intake chronically alter blood pressure level . Therefore , case beer per week , 21 ( 5 oz . ) glass wine , 21 shot ( 1.5 oz . ) hard liquor acceptable . Exclusion criterion also include neurological disorder ( serious head injury , seizure , presenile alcoholic dementia , Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis ) . Due MRI examination require , individual fit bore magnet exclude . Those known sensitivity sulfacontaining antibiotic include study undergo acetazolamide portion PET scanning session : acetazolamide sulfonamide analog . Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , pre perimenopausal ) test within 48 hour prior PET examination ensure absence pregnancy . A urinary pregnancy test ( e.g. , SureVue Urine hCG ) administer confirm absence pregnancy .</criteria>
