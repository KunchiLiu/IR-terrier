	<brief_summary>The researcher propose skin improvement may see follow course Efudex , ( 5-fluorouracil ) , FDA-approved topical therapy ( apply directly skin ) . These improvement could result reduction actinic keratoses ( small red horny growth flesh-colored wartlike growth cause overexposure ultraviolet radiation sun ) improvement sun-damaged skin . In addition , research study do determine expression p53 , tumor suppressor gene ( activity stop formation tumor ) , decrease follow Efudex treatment . Mutations ( abnormal change ) gene , call p53 , associate certain type skin cancer . In addition , p53-mutated gene know exist non-cancerous sun-damaged skin . Thus , presence p53 mutation may serve marker sun damage elevate risk develop skin cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Efudex Treatment Photoaged Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efudex ( 5-fluorouracil ) use topical chemotherapy treatment actinic keratoses ( AKs ) since 1950 's . Through many year use , Efudex deem safe effective therapy . It require , however , high level patient compliance know cause vigorous inflammatory reaction actinic keratoses treat . It distinct advantage identify precancerous skin lesion apparent clinical inspection palpation . Following course Efudex face , patient note few sign dermatoheliosis . The investigator propose determine Efudex associate improvement age skin set treat actinic keratoses . The researcher hope demonstrate less p53 stain follow Efudex treatment . It propose skin improvement see follow course Efudex due reduction actinic keratoses impact photoaging . The researcher propose quantify effect Efudex therapy immunohistochemical staining property facial skin respect p53 procollagen . The hypothesis Efudex therapy decrease p53 immunostaining thus provide biochemical evidence support treatment reduction actinic keratoses concomitant improvement age skin .</detailed_description>
