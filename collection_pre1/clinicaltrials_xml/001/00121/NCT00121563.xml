	<brief_summary>This study evaluate role thalidomide , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha modulator , severe inflammation relief pain follow extraction wisdom teeth . TNFs substance affect pathway pain . This study involve experimental group patient give thalidomide placebo ( inactive substance ) ; negative control group receive medication diazepam placebo ; positive control group receive diazepam ibuprofen . Patients male age 16 35 , allergic aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( know NSAIDs ) , sulfites , certain anesthetic , good health may eligible study . Females eligible , owe risk thalidomide present unborn child . To minimize risk fetal malformation , male patient participate must use condom sexual intercourse 4 week follow study must donate blood 4 week . The medication use study give 1 hour surgery . Then wisdom teeth remove , small piece tubing place side patient 's mouth teeth remove . Every 20 minute , next 6 hour , researcher collect inflammatory fluid tubing , measure change anti-inflammatory action . If request pain reliever , patient receive medication ketorolac ( Toradol ) , use short-term treatment moderately severe acute pain . Side effect thalidomide include fatigue , dizziness , rash . The use ibuprofen ketorolac may include risk gastrointestinal ulcer bleed . Diazepam cause involuntary muscle movement drowsiness , well dizziness last 24 hour use sedation . Patients instructed try walk alone try drive vehicle period . Other risk relate participation study include usually experienced removal wisdom teeth-that , pain swelling , bruise insertion sedative vein ( need ) , possible infection extraction site , prolong bleeding , numbness . Benefits participate wisdom teeth remove cost well close monitoring surgery . Results study may help people future improve management pain follow surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose investigation randomize , double-blind , placebo positive-controlled clinical study evaluate role cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) modulator , thalidomide , acute inflammation analgesia . The analgesic effect thalidomide , putative TNF-alpha modulator , evaluate use model tissue injury , oral surgery model . Briefly , healthy male refer third molar extraction undergo surgical extraction third molar use standard surgical method . At completion surgical procedure , microdialysis probe place mucogingival flap previously elevate surgical procedure subject observe pain course six hour follow surgery . Thalidomide control administer one hour prior surgery . Tissue level pro-inflammatory cytokine , inflammatory mediator measure time interval postoperatively concomitant pain measurement . Pain assess postoperatively course six hour . Demonstration amelioration pain primary outcome measure ; change level tissue mediator take evidence acute anti-inflammatory effect thalidomide . Based previous work fusion protein etanercept ( TNFR : fc ) specifically bind TNF-alpha prevents interaction cellular receptor , similar change inflammatory cascade clinical endpoint inflammation may provide insight activity thalidomide acute inflammation clinical sequela , pain .</detailed_description>
