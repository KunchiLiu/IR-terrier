	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess rate Prostate Specific Antigen response associate EMD121974 therapy patient non-metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety EMD121974 patient non-metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer . II . To assess change slope Prostate Specific Antigen associate EMD121974 patient non-metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer . III . To assess response duration , time progression survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect integrin αvβ3 αvβ5 inhibition total circulate tumor endothelial cell isolated peripheral blood bone marrow aspirate patient non-metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer . II . To study genotypic/phenotypic variance circulate tumor cell patient non-metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer EMD121974 treatment . III . To develop genetic profile cDNA microarray analysis circulate tumor cell isolated patient non-metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer integrin αvβ3 αvβ5 inhibition . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive cilengitide IV 1 hour day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 , 22 , 25 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 3 course , patient undergo evaluation . Patients achieve complete prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response ( i.e. , PSA &lt; 0.2 ng/mL ) receive 2-3 additional course therapy . Patients partial PSA response stable disease continue treatment indefinitely absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients demonstrate disease progression CT scan , MRI , bone scan remove study .</detailed_description>
