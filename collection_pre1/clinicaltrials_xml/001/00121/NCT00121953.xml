	<brief_title>Effect Rosiglitazone Peritoneal Cytokines Women With Endometriosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal proposal assess modulation immune mechanisms endometriosis . Endometriosis common ailment affect approximately five million reproductive-aged American woman . We test efficacy novel immunomodulatory drug ( peroxisome proliferator activate receptor gamma , PPAR-gamma , agonist ) , rosiglitazone , reduce peritoneal fluid cytokine concentration woman endometriosis compare placebo control ( randomize control trial ) . Based prior study do investigator highlight major role cytokine immune system genesis propagation endometriosis , experiment could lead improved translational treatment strategy well understanding endometriosis . Acting PPAR-gamma , TZDs inhibit proinflammatory cytokine well NF-kB , important nuclear transcription factor production many cytokine . Accordingly , since human endometrial epithelial stromal cell contain PPAR-gamma , felt would useful evaluate influence PPAR-gamma ligand , rosiglitazone , concentration specific peritoneal fluid cytokine . Comparison : After pre-trial screening , eligible subject presume endometriosis age 18-45 consent randomly assign receive either placebo ( control ) rosiglitazone , Avandia® , 4 mg daily 2 week . Peritoneal fluid collect time surgery volume measure . All patient enrol study surgery follicular phase cycle order minimize difference volume cytokine concentration due cyclical change . The primary measure peritoneal fluid concentration comparison two group assess six different cytokine : interleukin-1 beta , RANTES , tumor necrosis factor-alpha vascular endothelial growth factor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy woman age 18 45 year . Regular menstrual cycle ( 2435 day ) . Pelvic pain ≥3 month Negative pregnancy test Nonlactating No prior ( &lt; 3 month ) use hormonal therapy ( &lt; 6 mo depoprovera user ) No history liver disease Consent participate study Endometriosis diagnose surgical specimen routine hematoxylin eosin stain histological evaluation ( within past 4 year ) Major psychiatric condition abuse alcohol drug would make difficult subject complete study procedure . Active prior infection hepatitis , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , history highrisk activity ( e.g. , intravenous [ IV ] drug abuse ) would increase risk laboratory personnel . Of note , test hepatitis HIV perform part study tissue handle discard potentially infect . Patients liver dysfunction ( elevate liver enzymes &gt; 2 time upper limit normal ) . Presence preexist malignancy , include carcinoma breast uterus . Women cause chronic pelvic pain include infectious , gastrointestinal , musculoskeletal , neurologic psychiatric . Elevated white blood cell ( WBC ) count . NYHA functional class IIV heart failure . Diabetes mellitus . Known pregnancy positive pregnancy test .</criteria>
