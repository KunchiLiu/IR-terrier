	<brief_title>Vorinostat Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine objective response rate patient metastatic unresectable melanoma treat vorinostat . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine time progression patient treat drug . II . Determine utility HP1 and/or macro H2A nuclear focus biomarkers response patient treated drug . III . Correlate presence 72R 72P variant p53 polymorphism response time progression patient treat drug . IV . Determine gene expression profile may predict response drug gene expression change occur treatment drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral vorinostat daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
