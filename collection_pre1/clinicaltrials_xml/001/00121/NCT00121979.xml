	<brief_summary>Racivir ® ( RCV ) experimental drug mean approve use United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , use research study like one . RCV ( Racivir® ) part class drug know `` Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors '' ( NRTIs ) , intend block increase amount HIV virus body . Laboratory research suggest RCV ( Racivir® ) may effective patient develop resistance NRTIs , particularly 3TC ( lamivudine , Epivir® ) . However , study RCV ( Racivir® ) do patient previously treat HAART ( Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy -- take multiple HIV drug ) medication include 3TC ( lamivudine , Epivir® ) . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness RCV ( Racivir® ) use together HIV drug people previously treat 3TC ( lamivudine , Epivir® ) fail current HAART treatment . This study include total 60 HIV infect , HAART-experienced subject currently receive 3TC ( lamivudine , Epivir® ) part HAART therapy . The study take place approximately 11 study site US Latin America .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Racivir Lamivudine Treatment-Experienced HIV Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study divide four period : ‘ Screening ’ period last 30 day duration , ‘ Blinded Treatment ’ period last 4 week duration , ‘ Follow-up ’ period 28 day duration , ‘ Open-label Treatment ’ period subject give option participate last 20 week . If eligible subject decide participate research study , randomize , like pick chance hat , get RCV ( Racivir® ) alone , 3TC ( lamivudine , Epivir® ) alone , RCV 3TC ( lamivudine , Epivir® ) combination . This “ double-blind study ” . This mean neither subject study doctor study staff know subject receive RCV ( Racivir® ) , 3TC ( lamivudine , Epivir® ) , RCV ( Racivir® ) 3TC ( lamivudine , Epivir® ) . This need do make sure researcher obtain information need see RCV ( Racivir® ) safe effective 3TC ( lamivudine , Epivir® ) . In case emergency , study doctor able find immediately study drug subject receive . With exception , sign consent form subject agree able find medication take , “ double-blind ” study , necessary use placebo tablet . A placebo tablet contain active drug , make look like study drug . Subjects give three bottle study medication . They ask take one tablet bottle day mouth , addition current HAART drug , include 3TC . The 3TC current HAART regimen must discontinue prior begin study medication . It important subject follow direction take study drug . After complete first 14 day blind treatment period , subject give option continue current randomized therapy , include current study medication , additional 1-2 week . On Day 15 , blood sample collect determine amount HIV virus blood . Once result blood sample available , subject tell amount much HIV virus change blood first 14 day treatment . Subjects also tell receive RCV ( Racivir® ) alone , 3TC ( lamivudine , Epivir® ) alone , combination RCV ( Racivir® ) 3TC ( lamivudine , Epivir® ) . If subject receive RCV ( Racivir® ) , continue open-label treatment period , amount virus blood must drop least 2/3 first 14 day blind treatment period . For example , subject enter study 10,000 copy HIV virus per milliliter ( ml ) blood , continue open-label period , virus level must drop 3,162 copy less , per ml blood . Open-label mean participate subject study doctor study staff know treatment subject receive . If virus drop least 2/3 , subject give option enter open-label treatment period . During open-label period , subject receive 600 mg RCV ( Racivir® ) daily along regular HAART medication . Before enter open-label period , study doctor may decide change subject 's ARV medication . Participating subject financially responsible medication , RCV ( Racivir® ) , study doctor may prescribe . Once treatment “ unblinded ” , subject may learn receive RCV ( Racivir® ) blind treatment period . Subjects may voluntarily decide add 600 mg RCV ( Racivir® ) daily HAART medication . The study doctor may decide change subject 's HAART medication time . After 2 week RCV ( Racivir® ) base treatment , subject ask return study doctor ’ office blood drawn determine amount HIV virus blood . Subjects may continue RCV ( Racivir® ) additional 2 week result blood test available . If viral load decline least 2/3 , subject withdraw open-label portion study . Subjects ask return study doctor ’ office final follow-up visit approximately 28 day last dose RCV ( Racivir® ) . The open-label treatment period last longer 20 week . During study , subject receive 24 week RCV ( Racivir® ) therapy . After subject receive last dose study medication , enter follow-up period 28 day . If participate subject study doctor decide withdraw study early , subject need return study doctor ’ office follow-up visit approximately 28 day last dose RCV ( Racivir® ) .</detailed_description>
