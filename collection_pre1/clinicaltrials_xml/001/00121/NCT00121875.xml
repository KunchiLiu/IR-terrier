	<brief_summary>Growth hormone treatment improve body fat distribution also cause insulin resistance . Scientists recently link insulin resistance special store fat muscle , measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The researcher hypothesize growth hormone paradoxically reverse linkage muscle fat store insulin resistance . To assess association investigate cause ( ) , researcher measure muscle fat store growth hormone treatment . Other parameter link insulin resistance ( glucose tolerance , blood marker , body composition ) also assess . This study may lead improved strategy monitor growth hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Identify Markers Insulin Resistance During Growth Hormone Treatment Short Stature</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth hormone ( GH ) treatment cause insulin resistance ( IR ) despite overall favorable influence body fat composition . IR associate special store fat muscle ( intramyocellular lipid IMCL ) , measure MRI . The researcher hypothesize change IR GH treatment associate predictable , possibly contradictory , change muscle fat store . Girls receive GH short stature , due Turner syndrome idiopathic short stature ( ISS ) , study without GH treatment assess impact GH treatment muscle fat store . Hypothesis : Girls Turner syndrome increase IMCL , correspond insulin resistance , compare girl ISS . GH treatment may paradoxically reverse association girl Turner syndrome . Objectives : The objective assess change IMCL GH therapy increase researcher ' knowledge GH action . Study Design : Prepubertal girl receive GH therapy short stature due Turner syndrome ISS recruit participate crossover study . Subjects study twice : first GH treatment baseline , follow washout without GH 3 month . GH treatment 6 month provide eligible girl currently receive GH . Assessments include : - IMCL ( soleus tibialis anterior ) measure non-invasively proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) - Body composition measure DEXA morphometry - Whole body insulin sensitivity assess oral glucose tolerance - Levels plasma lipid hormone Endpoints : The primary endpoint define effect GH IMCL content girl Turner syndrome versus girl ISS . The secondary endpoint examine GH affect IMCL content identify correlative change plasma hormone metabolite . Significance : This study intend find improved strategy monitor GH therapy . In addition , IMCL anticipate valuable probe understand GH effect glucose homeostasis .</detailed_description>
