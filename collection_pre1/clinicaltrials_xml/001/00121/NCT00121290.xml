	<brief_title>SJG-136 Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose recommended phase II dose SJG-136 patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor . II . Determine safety dose-limiting toxic effect drug patient . III . Determine , preliminarily , efficacy drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine pharmacokinetic parameter drug metabolites patient . II . Correlate pharmacokinetic parameter clinical effect drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation study . Patients receive SJG-136 intravenously ( IV ) 20 minute daily day 1-3 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 1-6 patient receive escalate dos SJG-136 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . At least 6 patient treated MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
