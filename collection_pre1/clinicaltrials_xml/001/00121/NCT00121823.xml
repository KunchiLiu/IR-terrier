	<brief_summary>The ability test candidate pre-erythrocytic stage malaria vaccine , use well-established sporozoite challenge model , field set group size ten rather hundred volunteer would greatly facilitate identification promise vaccine candidate . The investigator assess suitability acceptability method field trial semi-immune volunteer expose natural infection high malaria transmission season .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Malaria Infection Diagnosed Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) Means Evaluating Pre-erythrocytic Candidate Malaria Vaccines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective The primary objective study determine sensitive PCR technique , capable detect malaria parasite low density could use economical method undertake preliminary field evaluation pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine . A secondary objective determine intensive blood sample method require would acceptable . Study area This study conduct June October 2004 incidence malaria The Gambia high . Volunteers recruit 9 village east Farafenni , town 200km east capital city , Banjul . Malaria highly seasonal area entomological inoculation rate 10 50 infectious bite per year . Study population Healthy volunteer age 15-45 year screen two centre eligibility take part study . Screening involved thorough physical examination well blood sample test haematological ( full blood count , pack cell volume [ PCV ] ) , renal ( plasma creatinine level ) hepatic ( alanine amino transferase ) test HIV 1 2 test ELISA . A glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency test carry risk involve administer study drug Primaquine Lapdap volunteer G6PD deficient . Exclusion criterion include PCV &lt; 30 % , raise plasma creatinine ( &gt; 130 micromoles/litre ) ALT level ( &gt; 42 IU/litre ) , G6PD deficiency , simultaneous participation another clinical trial , blood transfusion month prior vaccination , previous experimental malaria vaccination , administration another vaccine within 2 week vaccination , allergy previous vaccination sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine , history splenectomy treatment immunosuppressive drug . Study procedure Eligible volunteer enrol study write , informed consent obtain . All eligible volunteer issue unique number photo identification card . Volunteers randomly allocate three group receive either two 5 x10^7 pfu dos FP9 ME-TRAP follow single dose 1 x 10^8 pfu MVA ME-TRAP ( malaria vaccine group ) 3 dos rabies vaccine ( Fansidar rabies group ) . All vaccine give 4 week apart administer intradermally . Following vaccination , volunteer observe 1 hr give course anti-pyretic ( paracetamol ) take require . In addition , home visit make field worker day 1 , 2 , 7 28 vaccination record adverse event use standard diary card . All volunteer receive single dose Primaquine ( 30mg ) 7 day final dose vaccination radical cure gametocytes 3-day course short act anti-malaria drug , Lapdap Artesunate combination start day final vaccination clear asexual form parasite follow-up period . Additionally , volunteer Fansidar group receive long act anti-malarial drug expect remain PCR negative throughout follow-up period . Volunteers follow intensively 28 day start 7days last vaccination . The period follow-up time correspond period high malaria transmission . Follow-up daily finger-pricks obtain 0.5mls blood microtainer PCR analysis duplicate blood film estimation malaria parasite . Laboratory staff conduct immunoassay PCR analysis blind group allocation volunteer approval analysis plan Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . Sample size Based practical statistical consideration researcher propose enroll 40 volunteer per group ( total 120 ) . Allowing steady rate drop-out follow amount total 20 % subject end trial , trial least 80 % power detect difference time infection malaria vaccine rabies group , vaccine efficacy least 60 % , least 70 % control group volunteer develop detect parasitaemia trial . Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) A DSMB set oversee conduct trial approve analytical plan unblinding laboratory staff . The trial conduct accord ICH Good Clinical Practice guideline guide Medical Research Council regulation conduct clinical trial .</detailed_description>
