	<detailed_description>Preemptive analgesia define “ analgesic intervention provide surgery prevent reduce subsequent pain ” . By prevent central sensitization use nociceptive blocker regional analgesia may able produce painless postsurgical state . The use preemptive analgesia report various surgical procedure , limb surgery , laparoscopic procedure , mastectomy vaginal hysterectomy . Regarding abdominal hysterectomy report , however , malignancy benign case include conflict result obtain regard value preemptive analgesia . Since hysterectomy frequent major surgical procedure perform gynecology , estimate age 64 year , 40 % woman hysterectomy , would great value optimize pain treatment patient . The aim present study evaluate effectiveness preemptive analgesia woman undergo transabdominal hysterectomy benign uterine abnormality . Material Methods : The study approve Institutional Review Board accordance Helsinki declaration . Rambam Medical Center public hospital , private patient woman treat accord standard guideline . Women benign uterine myoma without menometrorrhagia consider study . Patients exclude systemic vascular neurological disease , diabetes two previous abdominal surgery . A write informed consent , obtain patient prior randomization two treatment group . In first group 20 ml 1 % lidocaine inject subcutaneously incisional region 15 minute prior start operation . In second group 20 ml normal saline inject subcutaneously incisional area 15 minute prior operation . The syrinx contain Lidocaine Saline solution prepare coded pharmacist hospital . The surgeon , anesthetist nurse staff blind type solution , inject . The code disclose end study . The anesthetic technique standardize . A transverse lower abdominal incision use patient . After completion operation patient treat postoperative care unit two hour . The time arrival postoperative care unit define time zero . Analgesia morphine pethidine provide patient request . Thereafter patient transfer Gynecological department . The standard care postoperative pain department follow : three fix dos Ibuprofen 400 mg three hour interval first dose administrate arrival department ( 2 hour operation ) . Women inform , receive rescue dose another medication breakthrough pain analgesia need three hour elapse . In case receive intramuscular injection 10 mg morphine . After completion fix interval analgesic regimen , patient allow receive four dose oral analgesic upon request 3-hour interval . Starting second postoperative day , oral analgesia provide , patient request . Pain intensity evaluate first 24 postoperative hour , administration dose analgesic medication . The self-report pain assess measurement 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , range “ No Pain ” ( 0 ) , “ The pain imaginable ” ( 100 ) . Patients instructed place mark line indicate level pain experience . In addition , overall satisfaction post surgical pain treatment evaluate patient 72 hour surgery , use visual analogue scale phrase “ satisfactory ” “ satisfactory ” The VAS result 24 hour number dose analgesia consumption hospitalization compare two group use x test .</detailed_description>
