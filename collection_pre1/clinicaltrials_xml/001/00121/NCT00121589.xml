	<brief_summary>This study explore whether take vitamin lutein zeaxanthin , without Omega-3 fatty acid ( fish oil docosahexanoic acid , also know DHA ) change amount lutein zeaxanthin blood among people age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . AMD one lead cause legal blindness among people age 50 developed country . In disease , retina eye , sensory portion , worsen condition . AMD cause progressive loss central vision , peripheral vision remain , , ability someone see edge eye . To date , effective treatment improve vision people whose AMD advance . Yet data research study suggest possible role antioxidant , include lutein , reduce risk AMD cataract . Lutein zeaxanthin belong carotenoid family vitamin , 600 . There 40 50 carotenoid typical diet human being , 14 major dietary one identify human plasma . Lutein , particular , vitamin find naturally retina , especially macula , region eye essential fine , detailed vision . Previous study show high level food rich Omega-3 fatty acid associate low likelihood AMD . Patients age 60 older may may AMD , certain serious eye disorder , potentially life-threatening illness last year may eligible study . About 40 people participate . Patients undergo medical history physical examination . A blood collection 4 tablespoon do measure amount lutein vitamins blood . Patients complete eye examination consist procedure standard give ophthalmologist . Participants photograph take eye , undergo visual field test . Flicker photometry also conduct . This consist patient look flash bluish light one eye time , turn knob light stop flash . Then test , patient look away light turn knob flashing stop . During study study , patient ask take two tablet day multivitamins contain lutein . The vitamin supplement provide pill represent one two vitamin regimen give random basis : either lutein zeaxanthin DHA lutein zeaxanthin without DHA add . The amount would 10 mg/day lutein 2 mg/day zeaxanthin , without 1 g/day DHA . Patients return study center follow-up visit 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month . During visit , examination do earlier repeated researcher evaluate effect supplement patient ' eye . Patients also watch possible side effect vitamins supplement . Lutein zeaxanthin supplement consider safe possible minor side effect , headache difficulty swallow tablet . Fish oil DHA supplement may also cause abdominal discomfort . If information obtain study may important participant ' health , inform available . There plan give participant result medical test , evaluation , research data . Further research may necessary result become meaningful .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current propose study necessary pilot study prepare large-scale phase III randomize clinical trial plan investigate whether oral supplementation macular xanthophyll ( lutein zeaxanthin ) omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCPUFAs ) decrease progression age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) compare placebo . The primary objective pilot study investigate whether additional oral supplementation omega-3 LCPUFAs ( 1 g/day ) daily supplementation lutein ( 10 mg/day ) zeaxanthin ( 2 mg/day ) change plasma level lutein zeaxanthin participant age 60 . The secondary objective study whether change serum level xanthophyll , lutein zeaxanthin follow oral supplementation result change macular pigment density . In study , forty participant ( 20 participant per arm ) take study medication lutein ( 10 mg/day ) zeaxanthin ( 2 mg/day ) without omega-3 LCPUFAs ( 1 g/day ) 6 month follow total 9 month ( initial 6 month supplementation last 3 month without supplementation ) . Participants range AMD little drusen either eye advance AMD ( geographic atrophic , retinal pigment epithelial detachment , sign neovascular/exudative disease ) one eye . AMD severity classify use Age-Related Eye Disease Study ( AREDS ) criterion definition advance AMD . This preliminary study conduct prior large-scale phase III randomize clinical trial omega -3 LCPUFAs lutein/zeaxanthin patient moderate high risk AMD . The estimate increase serum lutein zeaxanthin level correspond change macular pigment density provide essential information conduct large phase III randomize trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants range AMD little drusen either eye end stage AMD ( geographic atrophic , retinal pigment epithelial detachment , sign neovascular/exudative disease ) one eye . AMD severity classify use AREDS criterion definition advance AMD . Children include AMD , definition , adult disease study design assess effect oral administration lutein person age group affect AMD . Men woman age 60 year old . Eligible participant may evidence AMD little drusen either eye , may stage AMD end stage ( geographic atrophic , retinal pigment epithelial detachment , sign neovascular/exudative disease ) one eye . The ability understand sign inform consent form prior enrollment . People currently smoke eligible enroll study . However , smoker take AREDSlike supplement , must take AREDSlike supplement study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Ocular disease ( AMD ) confound assessment retina include diabetic retinopathy , central serous choroidopathy , optic atrophy , retinal vein occlusion , active uveitis , significant explain unexplained visual field loss , type retinopathy retinal degeneration . Chronic requirement systemic ocular medication eye diseases glaucoma . Regular use lutein/zeaxanthin 6 mg : last 3 month currently take supplement . The daily use new Centrum Centrum Silver similar multivitamin allow limited maximum twice day . Participant regularly take 1 gm fish oil ( DHA , EPA ) last 3 month currently take fish oil supplementation Inability unwillingness follow ninemonth study period . Acute , potentially lifethreatening illness heart attack last year , malignancy blood disease remission . Any history lung cancer .</criteria>
