	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose 17-AAG give together sorafenib treat patient unresectable metastatic solid tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , 17-AAG , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving 17-AAG together sorafenib may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>17-AAG Sorafenib Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To recommend phase II dose 17AAG ( weekly intravenously 3 4 week ) , combination BAY 43-9006 ( twice daily orally ) , determine feasibility , safety , dose limit toxicity maximally tolerate dose . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate modulation pharmacodynamic effect investigate interaction two mechanisms action use combination : Studying surrogate tissue tumor cell signal Western blotting . Evaluating tumor blood flow utilize dynamic contrast enhance MRI . II . To study pharmacokinetic interaction two agent . III . To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity combination . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study 17-N-allylamino 17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day -14 28 course 1 day 1-28 subsequent course . Patients also receive 17-AAG IV 3 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 5-6 patient receive escalate dos 17-AAG maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 60 day .</detailed_description>
