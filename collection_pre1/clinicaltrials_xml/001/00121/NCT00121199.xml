	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give combination chemotherapy together rituximab bevacizumab work treat old patient stage II , stage III , stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill cancer cell . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . Giving combination chemotherapy together monoclonal antibody may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate 1-year progression-free survival rate patient advance stage diffuse large B-cell NHL treat CHOP - rituximab - bevacizumab . II . To estimate response rate ( complete , complete unconfirmed , partial ) 2-year progression-free survival regimen patient advanced stage diffuse large B-cell NHL . III . To evaluate toxicity associate regimen . IV . To correlate angiogenic biomarkers patient outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive rituximab IV , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute , cyclophosphamide IV 15 minute , doxorubicin IV , vincristine IV day 1 . Patients also receive oral prednisone day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least every 6 month 2 year annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
