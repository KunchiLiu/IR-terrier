	<brief_summary>This dose-seeking study test safety increase dos Rexin-G , give intravenously , patient advance metastatic pancreatic cancer fail standard chemotherapy . Rexin-G tumor-targeted gene therapy vector contain `` killer '' gene block action human cyclin G1 gene . Cyclin G1 cell cycle control element play important role cancer growth . When injected vein , Rexin-GTM vector seek accumulate cancerous tumor , therefore , increase concentration drug cancerous tumor normal neighbouring organ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Rexin-G Gene Transfer Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause cancer death United States . Every year , 30,000 new patient diagnose pancreatic cancer , die within year . The patient live beyond one year operable tumor whose cancer spread beyond pancreas . There effective treatment pancreatic cancer impact survival beyond month . Therefore , innovative treatment urgently need . A number experimental therapy currently investigation , gene therapy viable therapeutic option . A gene call cyclin G1 show play important part cancer growth . In animal experiment , cyclin G1 gene block , cancer cell grow much slow even die . This study test drug , Rexin-G , contain gene work get rid cyclin G1 gene . The new gene get tumor cell use `` vehicle '' carry cell . The `` vehicle '' use virus change likely cause disease . This `` vehicle '' call vector . When injected vein , Rexin-G vector design seek accumulate cancerous tumor , therefore , increase concentration drug area cancer normal neighbouring organ . When killer gene get cancer cell , become part cell 's gene tell cancer cell begin use new gene instead cyclin G1 gene . It hop Rexin-G arrest growth cancer eradicate tumor . The goal study determine much Rexin-G give patient , assess long Rexin-G stay body injected vein , drug would cause antibody form , transfer gene normal tissue pass gene another person person 's offspring . The final goal determine Rexin-G vector shrink tumor compare size tumor nodule measure CT scan MRI Rexin-G treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 year old . Locally advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer . Histologic cytologic confirmation diagnosis recurrence pancreatic cancer Measurable disease ( RECIST ) criterion . Tumor lesion situate previously irradiate area consider measurable , except radiologically confirm progression disease within radiation field radiation complete . Failed gemcitabine chemotherapy indicate disease progression ≤ 6 month last gemcitabine treatment Two less 2 chemotherapy regimen recurrent/progressive disease . Adequate hepatic function base laboratory value obtain less 7 day prior registration : Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL ; AST &lt; 2 x ULN ; AST &lt; 2 x ULN ; Hgb &gt; 9.0 gm/dL ; PT &lt; ULN ; PTT &lt; ULN ; Albumin &gt; 3.0 gm/dL ; Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3 x ULN ; Absolute granulocyte count &gt; 1000/uL ; Platelet count &gt; 100,000/uL ; Serum creatinine &lt; 1.2 mg/dL female ; &lt; 1.4 mg/dL male . ECOG performance status ( PS ) 0 1 . Ability provide inform consent . Life expectancy 12 week great . Male participant willing provide semen sample require interval . Inability patient provide semen sample make patient ineligible . ( EXCEPTION : If patient vasectomize . To noted study file ) . Fertile patient agree use barrier contraception ( condoms plus spermicidal jelly ) vector infusion period six week infusion . Accessibility peripheral central IV line adequate infusion investigational agent . Prior malignancy . ( EXCEPTION : Patients disease free ≥ 5 year and/or patient nonmelanoma skin cancer , Stage I breast cancer , CIS cervix ) Any follow : Pregnant woman ; Nursing woman ; Men woman childbearing potential unwilling employ adequate contraception ( condom , diaphragm , birth control pill , injection , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , abstinence , etc. ) . This study involve investigational agent whose genotoxic , mutagenic teratogenic effect develop fetus newborn unknown . Patients HIV+ , HBV+ HCV+ . Clinically significant ascites cause symptom require therapeutic paracentesis . Medical , psychiatric , social condition would compromise successful adherence protocol . Concomitant use chemotherapeutic , viral immunotherapeutic agent allow 6week study period . ≤ 4 week radiation therapy pancreatic primary ≤ 2 week palliative radiation therapy metastatic site . ≤ 4 week prior chemotherapy . History congestive heart failure .</criteria>
