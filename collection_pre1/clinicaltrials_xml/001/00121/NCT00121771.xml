	<brief_summary>Animal human study show prime-boost immunization strategy use malaria antigen express plasmid viral vector induces strong cellular immune response . An immunization regimen malaria vaccine DNA ME-TRAP follow MVA ME-TRAP induce strong T cell response adult United Kingdom ( UK ) Gambia provide significant clinical protection infection . The investigator assess two new vaccine utilize similar immunization strategy different malaria antigen , circumsporozoite ( CS ) protein . The entire CS protein express either modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) CS , attenuate fowlpox virus strain ( FP9 ) CS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary aim assessment safety reactogenicity vaccine Gambian adult . The secondary aim assessment immunogenicity comparison UK adult give vaccine . Study Area : The study conduct town Farafenni , 200km east capital city , Banjul . In area , malaria highly seasonal entomological inoculation rate 10-50 bite per year . This study carry January June , incidence malaria low . Study Population : The study involve 32 healthy Gambian adult age 18-45 year . Volunteers subject thorough physical medical examination . Exclusion criterion include low PCV ( &lt; 30 % ) ; raise plasma creatinine ALT level ; HIV positivity , determine ELISA assay . Study Procedure : After prior consultation community leader , public meeting hold inform community plan study . Volunteers age 18-45 year invite take part study write informed consent obtain presence principal investigator . Prior start screen exercise , investigator check age identity volunteer conduct pre-HIV test counselling . Screening involved thorough physical examination , blood sample haematological ( full blood count , pack cell volume [ PCV ] ) , renal ( plasma creatinine ) hepatic ( alanine aminotransferase ) test HIV 1 2 test ELISA . All eligible volunteer issue unique study number photo identification card . The initial part study design determine dose safety individual vaccine use open-label dose escalation method . Study volunteer randomly allocate two group four receive 5 x 10^7 pfu id either FP9 CS MVA CS . When good safety profile evident one week dose , another set four volunteer per group receive high dose ( 1 x 10^8 pfu id ) FP9 CS MVA CS . After investigator achieve satisfactory safety profile high dose vaccine give alone , proceed administer vaccine combination use heterologous prime-boost regime . The vaccine administer 4-week interval . Eight volunteer receive FP9 CS week 0 follow MVA CS week 4 ( FM group ) . Another set 8 volunteer receive FP9 CS week 0 4 , follow MVA CS week 8 ( FFM ) . Following vaccination , volunteer observe 1 hour give course antipyretic ( paracetamol ) take require . A physician study nurse could contact volunteer anytime course study . In addition , home visit make field worker day 1 , 2 , 7 28 , vaccination , record adverse event use standard questionnaire . Sample Size : Sample size determine requirement make preliminary evaluation inter-group inter-individual variability , avoid excessive risk allow realistic workload . Statistical significance may reach study low power , non-significant finding would provide justification need study great power . Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) : An international DSMB establish monitor conduct trial approve analytical plan . The trial conduct line ICH Good Clinical Practices guideline Medical Research Council ( MRC ) rule regulation conduct clinical trial .</detailed_description>
