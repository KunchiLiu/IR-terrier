	<brief_summary>Purpose : Retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) characterize progressive loss visual function due specific genetic mutation . This trial focus patient one severe form disease , X-linked inherit RP ( XLRP ) . This disease characterize early onset ( typically loss night vision child ) follow loss peripheral vision teenager young adult . There male-to-male transmission disease family . There cure RP treatment option limit . Two clinical trial find benefit nutritional supplementation long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , low daily dos although evidence slows disease progression certain instance . In clinical trial , propose high dose nutritional DHA supplement slow loss visual function preserve usable vision patient XLRP . This study 4-year placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial meaning patient 50-50 chance receive placebo experimental treatment . A total 66 patient enrol ; 33 receive placebo 33 receive treatment . Entry criterion include diagnosis XLRP ophthalmologist , age 7 32 year , male , sufficient visual function disease progression follow entire duration trial , willingness visit test site ( Dallas , TX ) year . Annual visual function test include ETDRS visual acuity , full-field multifocal electroretinography ( ERG ) , static peripheral visual field , fundus photography . Cone ERG function primary outcome measure . Funding Source - FDA , Foundation Fighting Blindness , DSM Nutritionals</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis RP retinal specialist Clinical diagnosis consistent Xlinked inheritance Enrolling minor young adult ( early onset Xlinked disease ; age 7 32 ) Measurable cone ERG responses patient less 0.64 microvolt response 31Hz flicker exclude likely become undetectable study Both eye must meet entry criterion test ( i.e. , cataract require surgery retinal detachment ) . Media clarity sufficient fundus photography Able return study site yearly interval Willing supply blood sample 6month interval Judiciously take placebo DHA supplement 4year study duration Patient/parent/guardian understand sign consent form . Excessive fish consumption ( e.g. , cold water fish salmon , tuna , sardine ) and/or fish oil supplementation ( oil contain DHA ) Baseline RBCDHA level show evidence supplementation ( typical level RBCDHA normal 3.8 % ) Chronic metabolic disease may interfere fatty acid metabolism require anticoagulant medication No ethnic racial group exclude .</criteria>
