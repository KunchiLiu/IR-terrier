	<brief_summary>In study , Liposome Entrapped Paclitaxel Easy Use ( LEP-ETU ) compare Taxol® examine whether paclitaxel 2 formulation undergoes similar processing body . Safety tolerability LEP-ETU Taxol also assess . In study , patient receive one intravenous infusion LEP-ETU Taxol , follow 3 week later infusion drug , dose infusion duration . Multiple blood sample take analysis , , drug infusion . Upon complete 2 Cycles treatment , eligible patient may enroll extension study ( LEP-ETU-102B ) continue treatment LEP-ETU . LEP-ETU liposomal formulation paclitaxel , widely use anti-cancer drug . This LEP-ETU formulation paclitaxel develop potentially reduce toxicity associate Taxol , eliminate drug formulation component polyoxyethylated castor oil ( Cremophor® EL ) . In LEP-ETU , paclitaxel associate liposome , microscopic membrane-like structure create lipid ( fat ) . Thus , LEP-ETU formulation could potentially reduce toxicity , maintain enhance efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 1B , open-label , two-period crossover bioequivalence study design compare pharmacokinetics ( PK ) LEP-ETU Taxol patient advance cancer . Patients randomized determine drug administer first . A single dose LEP-ETU Taxol ( Cycle A ) administer , follow 3 week later single dose drug ( Cycle B ) . Blood sample PK analysis take , , infusion drug . Following successful completion Cycles study , patient may eligible additional cycle treatment LEP-ETU LEP-ETU-102B extension study .</detailed_description>
