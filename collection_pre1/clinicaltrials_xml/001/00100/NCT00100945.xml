	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine 1-year overall survival rate patient previously treat locally advanced adenocarcinoma esophagus gastroesophageal junction treat gefitinib maintenance therapy . Secondary - Determine disease-free survival time disease recurrence patient treat drug . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine quality life patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease recurrence unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , 4 week , every 12 week study treatment , end study treatment . Patients follow every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
