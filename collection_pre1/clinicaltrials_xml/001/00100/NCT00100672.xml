	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study identify dose Liposome Entrapped c-raf Antisense Oligonucleotide Easy-to-Use ( LErafAON-ETU ) maximize potential benefit compound patient advanced cancer , without compromise safety . This study also assess process LErafAON-ETU body time . Patients receive intravenous infusion LErafAON-ETU week . Multiple blood sample take pharmacokinetic analysis first treatment ; two sample take second third treatment . Patients eligible continue treatment occurrence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . In LErafAON-ETU , antisense oligonucleotides specific c-raf , associate liposome , microscopic membrane-like structure create lipid ( fat ) . Raf-1 protein play critical role many aspect cellular activation growth . Therefore , think important factor may support tumor development . LErafAON-ETU potentially limit ability cell produce Raf-1 protein .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose LErafAON Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , dose-escalation study design determine maximum tolerate dose LErafAON-ETU patient advance cancer consider unresponsive available , conventional modality treatment . LErafAON-ETU administered IV infusion weekly 3 consecutive week ( Treatment Cycle ) . A complete pharmacokinetic profile raf-1 antisense oligonucleotide assess week 1 ; limit pharmacokinetic sample do prior end infusion week 2 3 . Tumor/disease evaluation perform upon completion 6 infusion ( 2 Cycles ) . Dose escalation occur safety tolerability give dose level confirm 1 Cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To include study , patient must meet following criterion : Be ≥18 year age . Have advance ( local and/or metastatic ) histologically document cancer consider responsive available conventional modality treatment ( i.e. , life prolong therapy therapy great potential patient benefit available ) . Have ECOG Performance status 01 . Have life expectancy &gt; 12 week . Have recover acute toxicity prior treatment : *No treatment radiotherapy cytotoxic biologic agent within 3 week prior study entry . At least 2 week must elapse since prior surgery granulocytestimulating growth factor therapy . Chronic treatment noninvestigational gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists hormonal supportive care permit . Concurrent bisphosphonate treatment permit initiated ≥90 day prior study entry . *Chronic Grade 1 toxicity due prior treatment cause permit . Be adequate condition evidence follow clinical laboratory value : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500/mm³ , Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL , Platelets ≥125,000/mm³ , PT , aPTT , creatinine , calcium , total bilirubin ≤the institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) , Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤2.5 x ULN , Alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 x ULN Patients ( male female ) must willing practice effective method birth control study . Patient must understand investigational nature study sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve informed consent form prior performance study specific procedure . Patients exclude study follow : Active uncontrolled bleeding bleed diathesis ( e.g. , active peptic ulcer disease ) . Any active infection require parenteral oral antibiotic treatment . Known infection human immunodeficiency virus hepatitis virus . Active heart disease include myocardial infarction within previous 6 month , symptomatic coronary artery disease , arrhythmias currently require medication , congestive heart failure . Known suspect active central nervous system metastasis ( patient stable 8 week completion treatment central nervous system metastasis eligible ) . Requiring immediate palliative treatment kind , include surgery and/or radiotherapy Concurrent antitumor therapy ( except chronic hormonal antitumor therapy ) . Treatment investigational drug within 30day period prior enrollment study . Known hypersensitivity component LErafAONETU . Prior treatment LErafAON ( previous sonicated formulation ) . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding . Unwilling unable follow protocol requirement . Any consideration Investigator 's opinion deem patient unsuitable candidate receive study drug .</criteria>
