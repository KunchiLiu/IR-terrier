	<brief_summary>The purpose multi-center , open-label , escalate dose study assess safety tolerability PPI-2458 subject Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) solid tumor . Subjects treat every day ( QOD ) PPI-2458 monitor closely adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety/Tolerance Study PPI-2458 Subjects With Non-Hodgkin ’ Lymphoma Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study first determine dose level maximally inhibit MetAP2 white blood cell ( WBC ) . Once dose level reach , study proceed next cohort ( dose level ) investigate dose level maximally inhibit MetAP2 tumor tissue biopsy . Free MetAP2 level ( WBC and/or tumor tissue ) analyze first cycle ( 28 day ) treatment . Cohorts expect enroll every two cycle maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . After Initial Treatment Phase two treatment cycle PPI-2458 , subject may continue Continuous Treatment Phase discretion Investigator . In order eligible Continuous Treatment Phase protocol , subject must receive benefit ( e.g. , stable disease ) assess Investigator within Initial Treatment Phase must continue meet inclusion exclusion criterion .</detailed_description>
