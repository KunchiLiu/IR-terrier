	<brief_summary>This study use stereo photogrammetry : 1 ) characterize facial feature genetic congenital malformation ; 2 ) define facial feature associate normal growth development ; 3 ) determine stereo photogrammetry soft tissue image use help diagnose head facial malformation . These abnormality currently diagnose use 2- 3-dimensional skeletal image obtain x-ray . Stereo photogrammetry use camera computer generate 3-dimensional image soft tissue face . Because method use radiation , image take repeatedly evaluate patient long term . Using stereo photogrammetry , image people belong define group , example , 17-year-old Caucasian male , combine ( morph ) one image , allow measurement facial feature group . Comparing morphed image normal control group people specific genetic condition may reveal distinction could use diagnose condition currently diagnose use x-rays . Healthy normal volunteer patient craniofacial dysmorphologies may eligible study . Patients recruit current NIH study various genetic disease . People previously head neck surgery , include cosmetic surgery , may participate . Participants give medical dental history , include orthodontic work facial surgery . They position front photogrammetry camera , headband place head , picture take . A coded patient number enter computer , image store analysis . Most participant evaluate one time , patient control subject may ask return yearly repeat image .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In previous decade , analysis craniofacial dysmorphologies conduct use two- three-dimensional imaging skeletal tissue acquire radiography , little analysis soft tissue structure . The advantage stereophotogrammetry surface scan include easy image acquisition , procedure non-invasive , image may easily repeatedly take longitudinal evaluation facial morphology . No radiation use acquire image . The purpose study : 1 ) characterize surface tissue facial feature different genetic disease syndrome ; 2 ) define facial parameter age-related growth development ; 3 ) establish use stereophotogrammetry surface tissue image aid diagnosis genetic condition prediction clinic course craniofacial dysmorphologies associate genotype . Procedures entail acquisition facial image patient know suspected dysmorphologies well healthy control . Facial parameter various patient group characterize standardized manner . In addition , composite ( mean ) image patient particular diagnosis compare control use software algorithm . These facial parameter use calculate sensitivity specificity technology predict genetic dysmorphology .</detailed_description>
