	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety immune response hepatitis B virus vaccine series give boost agent , CpG7909 oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODN ) , HIV infect HIV uninfected individual previously fail develop response hepatitis B vaccine . Study hypothesis : Administration CpG7909 ODN together recombinant hepatitis B vaccine result increase frequency magnitude response vaccine individual previously fail mount response vaccination , HIV infect subject detectable plasma viremia , lead enhancement HIV-specific response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Hepatitis B Virus Vaccine Given With Booster ( CpG7909 ODN ) HIV Infected HIV Uninfected People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As HIV disease progress HIV infected people , immune response infectious foreign invader become weak ; particular , cellular ( T-cell ) immune response particularly affect HIV . A boosting agent call CpG7909 ODN may ideal adjuvant vaccine give HIV infected people , may help elicit increased CD8 T-cell response . This study evaluate safety immune response hepatitis B virus vaccine series give CpG7909 ODN HIV infect uninfected people . There three group study ; participant stratify baseline CD4 count viral load . Within group , participant randomly assign receive 3 injection hepatitis B vaccine CpG7909 ODN 3 injection hepatitis B vaccine alone . Injections give study entry Months 1 6 . There 10 study visit ; physical exam blood collection occur visit .</detailed_description>
