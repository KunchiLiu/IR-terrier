	<brief_title>Trial DMXB-A Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective trial determine dose DMXB-A twice daily 4 week improve cognition safe . Secondary goal determine neurocognitive effect also effect neurobiological paradigm previously show responsive nicotinic receptor stimulation : suppression P50 auditory evoke response , saccadic intrusion smooth pursuit eye movement , hemodynamic activity hippocampus smooth pursuit eye movement measure fMRI . The purpose neurobiological measure ass whether response DMXB-A consistent activation nicotinic receptor . In addition , investigator assess clinical response use battery clinical assessment scale assessment daily live function . The purpose assessment address FDA requirement clinical effect beyond change laboratory neuropsychological performance . This study subsequent two study also include assessment safety DMXB-A related compound . The purpose trial lay groundwork Phase III investigation . If trial find DMXB-A effect safe dose , without tachyphylaxis , investigator intend proceed Phase III trial , clinical importance effect measure . The trial double blind trial placebo control . The order dose placebo randomize . The Phase 1 study complete January , 2005 , 12 non-smoking schizophrenic subject . The subject concurrently treat neuroleptic throughout study . They receive 3 treatment , 1 day , double-blind crossover design . The treatment DMXB-A ( 150 mg + 75 mg 2 hour later ) , DMXB-A ( 75 mg + 37.5 mg 2 hour later ) , placebo . A significant effect neurocognition , measure Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status , sensory gating , measure P50 auditory evoke potential observe . Subjects report significant symptom . One subject 's white blood cell count decrease normal limit placebo normal level DMXBA ( 150 + 75 mg 2 hour later ) . He receive exposure drug white blood cell count return normal next testing , 2 day later .</detailed_description>
