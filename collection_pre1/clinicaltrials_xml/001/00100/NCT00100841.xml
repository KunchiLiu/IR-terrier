	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth colorectal cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab cetuximab may kill tumor cell . This phase II trial study well give combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab cetuximab work treat patient stage IV colorectal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial FOLFOX6 , Bevacizumab Cetuximab Patients With Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety , feasibility administration , response rate progression free survival among chemotherapy na√Øve patient advanced colorectal cancer treat FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab cetuximab ( FBC ) . II . To determine survival patient advanced colorectal cancer treat FBC . III . To determine safety current regimen select patient prior MoAb therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cetuximab IV 60-120 minute day 1 week 1-8 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 , fluorouracil IV continuously 48 hour day 1 2 week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . Courses repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40-67 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
