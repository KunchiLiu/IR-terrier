	<brief_summary>This study examine saliva sample healthy volunteer patient various disease learn disease affect mouth salivary gland . It use method call salivary proteomics identify multiple protein saliva discover protein pattern unique specific disease . The study : - Characterize salivary proteome patient Sjogren 's syndrome , graft-versus-host disease , diabetes , sarcoidosis , cystinosis , dental caries , immunodeficiency patient head neck radiation - Evaluate possible use salivary proteomics early diagnosis - Evaluate potential use salivary proteomics prognosis treatment Patients participate NIH clinical study Sjogren 's syndrome , graft-versus-host disease , diabetes , sarcoidosis , cystinosis , dental caries , immunodeficiency , patient undergo head neck radiation may eligible study . Candidates screen medical dental history , head neck examination , photographs mouth sore disease . Healthy volunteer also blood drawn routine laboratory test . Participants saliva collect floor mouth , parotid salivary gland cheek , submandibular sublingual salivary gland tongue . Patients certain disease also provide urine sample . Saliva sample collect follow : - One time healthy volunteer patient Sjogren 's syndrome , diabetes , sarcoidosis , cystinosis immunodeficiency - Five time patient undergoing stem cell transplant : baseline transplant 1 , 2 , 3 6 month transplant . - Three time patient undergo head neck radiation : baseline radiation 3 6 month conclusion radiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The diagnostic potential proteomic method explore several group recent year . Saliva contain many protein , alter various disease state . In study , saliva sample patient head neck radiation , diabetes , hematopoietic stem cell transplant , Sjogren 's syndrome , cystinuria , methylmalonic acidemia condition . Various novel analytical data-processing tool use infer characteristic salivary protein salivary analyte signatures disorder . In case , data evaluate data oral flora present saliva plaque patient group relate presence level particular bacteria proteomic profile .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Male female subject age racial group include . The low age limit determine ability cooperate saliva collection method : i.e . 6 month 100 year old . 2 . Patients recruit current NIH Clinical Center pool outside community . Patients must diagnose cystinosis , sarcoidosis , head neck cancer , Sjogren 's syndrome diabetes institute physician . Controls recruit various NIH population generally healthy without one disease list NIH Healthy Volunteer Program . 3 . Patients benign malignant disease undergo bone marrow transplant hematopoeitic stem cell transplant eligible . Among patient malignant disease solid tumor leukemias include . Patients diagnose unequivocally GVHD via biopsy affect organ system include disease group . Patients include control group GVHD reliably exclude . 4 . For caries study , examine salivary sample already collect large twin cohort study Brazil . These sample collect twin sibling part study early childhood caries . Results study suggest genetics role development caries . Whole salivary sample collect frozen analysis . These sample examine difference salivary protein may associate development early childhood caries . Samples cod unique numerical identifier clinical diagnosis caries , well subject age , gender ethnicity . No patient information link identifier ensure patient confidentiality . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients receive autologous HCT peripheral stem cell transplant . 2 . Patients unable cooperate saliva collection . 3 . Controls medical history laboratory finding consistent Sjogren 's syndrome , sarcoidosis , diabetes , generally poor health , control take medication know alter salivary protein profile .</criteria>
