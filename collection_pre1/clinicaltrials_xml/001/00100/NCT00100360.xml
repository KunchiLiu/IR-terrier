	<brief_summary>This study explore possible hormonal cause menstrual-related mood disorder ( MRMD ) stop menstrual cycle drug call Lupron give sequence two menstrual cycle hormone , progesterone estrogen . The study first evaluate Lupron 's effectiveness treat MRMD examine effect give estrogen progesterone mood behavior . In addition , positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use study serotonin receptor transporter - molecule brain think play major role mood change relate menstrual cycle . Menstruating woman 18 50 year age good health , pregnant , take medication may eligible study . Women MRMD must least moderately severe MRMD behavioral disturbance least 6 month within 2 year enter study . Healthy control must history MRMD behavioral disturbance . Candidates undergo physical neurological examination , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram , blood urine test . Results recent Pap smear ( long 12 month begin study ) must available . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Drug treatment : Lupron inject muscle month 5 month . After second month , participant receive estrogen progesterone , , daily . Estrogen deliver skin patch ( 20 microgram per day ) progesterone take rectal vaginal suppository twice day remain 12 week study . Every day , participant wear skin patch insert two suppository , point 12 week , active medication replace placebo allow drug wash body . - Physical examination blood draw : A physical examination blood test do start study several time study assess general health , evaluate liver kidney function , measure blood cell count . - Response treatment drug : Responses Lupron , estrogen , progesterone evaluate periodically interviews symptom self-rating scale . Control subject also take paper pencil psychological test . - PET imaging : A total six PET scan do three time point hormone treatment . PET use small amount radioactive chemical call tracer `` label '' active area brain . For procedure , subject lie scanner bed . A special mask fit head attach bed help keep subject 's head still scan image clear . A brief scan do radioactive tracer inject help analyze PET data . After tracer inject catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm , picture take 2 hour , subject lie still scanner bed . - MRI scan : MRI us magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . For procedure , patient lie table move scanner ( narrow cylinder ) wear earplugs muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The procedure last 1 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The central serotonergic ( 5HT ) system one candidate system may mediate abnormal mood behavioral response ovarian steroid observe woman menstrual-related mood disorder ( MRMD ) . Numerous study attempt measure 5HT system function woman MRMD control ; however , previous study restrict evaluation indirect measure 5HT function ( e.g. , platelet 5HT uptake response serotonergic pharmacologic challenge ) . Radioligand image specific component 5HT system currently represent direct measure central serotonergic function available . In study image serotonergic measure pharmacological condition previously demonstrate induce remission subsequent provocation mood symptom woman MRMD control . This protocol two outcome measure ( 5HT ( 1A ) binding SERT binding ) , two group subject ( woman MRMD control ) , three distinct hormonal condition ( hypogonadism , estrogen replacement , progesterone replacement ) . Our principal aim study investigate difference outcome measure woman MRMD compare control . Our primary hypothesis 5HT ( 1A ) binding decrease SERT bind increased woman MRMD . A secondary hypothesis woman MRMD , control , display reproductive steroid modulation 5HT ( 1A ) SERT binding . This study help test exist hypothesis pathophysiologic relevance serotonin function MRMD role reproductive steroid serotonergic regulation . First , select 5HT ( 1A ) receptor bind outcome measure follow reason : 5HT ( 1A ) function modulate estradiol progesterone , abnormalities 5HT ( 1A ) binding report depressive anxiety disorder well possibly MRMD , 5HT ( 1A ) receptor identify potential mediator estradiol 's antidepressant-like effect force swim test , 5HT ( 1A ) system involve regulation GABA activity abnormality implicate MRMD . Second , select SERT bind outcome measure follow reason : selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , traditional antidepressant , effective treatment MRMD ; abnormality SERT binding report depressive disorder woman , preliminary data suggest woman MRMD characterize elevated frequency long , transcriptionally active polymorphism serotonin transporter ( 5HTTLPR ) ( Roca et al ) ; woman MRMD alter imipramine binding platelet 5HT uptake compare control well alter platelet paroxetine binding ( normalize successful treatment GnRH agonist ) ; , finally , SERT message , bind protein report changed ovarian steroid preclinical study . We hypothesize effect hormonal condition 5HT ( 1A ) ( receptor ) binding differ patient control . Specifically , anticipate 5HT1A binding decrease hippocampus prefrontal cortex patient MRMD control . Such decrease , trait characteristic , demonstrable irrespective hormonal state . However , symptom MRMD directly precipitate estradiol progesterone ( see ) , possible symptom accompany state steroid-dependent change 5HT ( 1A ) binding function . Consequently , secondary hypothesis estradiol progesterone induces change 5HT ( 1A ) ( receptor ) bind woman MRMD control woman . Similarly , hypothesize woman MRMD increase SERT bind activity compare control , consistent therapeutic efficacy selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor condition . However , secondary hypothesis estradiol progesterone-induced change SERT bind occur hormone-dependent mood state-dependent manner . Specifically , consistent literature rodent , acute change ovarian steroid increase SERT bind association induction symptom woman MRMD control .</detailed_description>

Symptoms sudden onset offset . age 1850 . Not pregnant good medical health . Medication free . No prior DSMIV Axis I disorder . No prior history treatment antidepressant medication All patient participate protocol already participate protocol No . 81M0126 prospectively confirm predictable relationship mood disorder premenstrual phase menstrual cycle ; i.e. , 30 % change severity symptom self rating scale , relative range scale employ , seven day premenstrually compare seven day postmenstrually two three month study . Women without MRMD : No history menstrualrelated mood behavioral disturbance ; Age 18 50 year ; Not pregnant ; Good medical health ; Medication free . The absence menstrualrelated mood disorder prospectively confirm two month period prior study entry subject complete daily visual analogue rating scale monitor mood behavior outline NIMH protocol # 81M0126 . The Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV administer woman prior study entry . Any patient control current control past Axis I psychiatric diagnosis exclude participate protocol . Prior treatment , complete physical neurological examination perform ( normal chest Xray EKG ) follow routine laboratory data obtain : A .
