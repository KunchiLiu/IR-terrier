	<brief_summary>This study collect information people sense leg position movement . The finding may help scientist develop good way evaluate treat joint problem . Healthy adult volunteer 21 40 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen brief questionnaire examination determine strength , flexibility , sensation . Participants sit specially design chair , foot leg place custom-made apparatus control knee ankle movement . The skin mark indicate area interest ultrasound assessment muscle . Subjects respond joint position change several trial . The procedure take maximum 2.5 hour complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensing Leg Position Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proprioception describe afferent information typically arise peripheral mechanoreceptors contribute postural control , joint stability conscious sensation movement . Sensation movement divide joint position sense ( JPS ) detection passive movement sense ( DPMS ) . Collectively , two sensory modality commonly refer joint kinesthesia . Joint kinesthesia appear dependent specific joint anatomical structure , suggest different level acuity among various joint . However , whole limb accuracy appear great sum error across multiple joint extremity . Some suggest JPS error great 3 degree functional significance gait . However , author ' calculation position error gait neglect JPS error ankle hip , could also severely influence whole limb position sense , impact gait . We believe central nervous system ( CNS ) link together afferent proprioceptive feedback multiple joint limb segment reduce kinesthetic error across whole limb . The redundancy afferent information use `` error check '' improve proprioceptive feedback order maintain function . We use term Coupled Joint Proprioception ( CJP ) order describe phenomenon . To good understand relationship CJP human function , would isolate movement two adjacent joint , control bi-articular muscle length , determine influence single joint kinesthesia . Bi-articular muscle provide mechanical linkage within limb transfer force . Afferent information bi-articular muscle particular could provide context proprioceptive information structure ( single joint muscle , joint cutaneous receptor ) maintain enhance proprioception within limb . The redundant information , provide two-joint muscle , basis describe CJP . The overall objective non-invasive pilot study establish methodology necessary test influence CJP knee joint kinesthesia proprioceptive capability . The primary goal establish two experimental condition similar motion simultaneous knee joint extension ankle joint plantar flexion result shorten lengthen gastrocnemius muscle fiber . Following establishment condition , second goal develop evaluate novel method study influence CJP detection passive movement joint position sense knee joint . The information pilot data also help determine total number subject require undertake large clinical investigation CJP phenomenon . It important study CJP , proprioception typically measure clinically single joint human subject . Human function usually incorporate multiple joint , suggest CJP , measure across two joint , could representative human proprioceptive function . Therefore , CJP would provide avenue good study influence proprioceptive feedback human function walking . This especially important maintain proprioceptive feedback walking may minimize fall patient risk due low extremity injury pathology .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA This study include healthy male females 21 40 year age . This age range scientifically justified CNS musculoskeletal system fully mature adulthood lower extremity proprioception report decrease old subject . For project term healthy define lack systemic disease alters ability subject participate activity choice . In addition , healthy mean current pathology possibility damage muscle , ligament cartilage low extremity . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Subjects history low extremity musculoskeletal injury , alter peripheral feedback cutaneous joint muscle mechanoreceptors , exclude study . This include recent history chronic severe low extremity injury recent surgery , trauma , degenerative joint change , could influence performance study . Examples exclusion include ankle sprain patella dislocation subject exclude experienced injury within last six month . Multiple ( great 3 ) injury , describe , would warrant exclusion could indicator impaired sensation long term deficit . The presence local pain presence impaired sensation , indicate possible CNS dysfunction also exclude subject study . Subjects pain identified screening form subject impaired sensation , indicate CNS dysfunction , identify Part 2 , physical examination screen form . This screen form also evaluate general muscle strength , range motion , sensation joint integrity . This pilot study use total thirty subject . Subjects also screen excessive hamstring tightness , position described could produce discomfort prolonged subject positioning . This investigation intend develop methodology obtain pilot data regard existence couple proprioception mature healthy adult . Therefore , subject age 21 exclude , develop musculoskeletal central nervous system could impact outcome study .</criteria>
