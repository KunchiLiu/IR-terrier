	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether exercise alters way body store break fat . A second objective evaluate effect influence age gender . These study important aging , male gender , menopause associate increased storage abdominal fat frequently accompany diabetes , high blood cholesterol level , high blood pressure great risk heart attack , stroke , death . Increasing evidence suggest abnormality many effect age may partly due lack exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The physiologic cause ( ) age-related increase total body abdominal fat mass well-understood . The purpose study determine whether age associate decreased whole body lipolytic metabolic response epinephrine insulin , whether response may augment exercise training old woman estrogen administration investigate whether metabolic change relate reduction abdominal adiposity . Our objective project follow : ( 1 ) characterize age gender difference lipolysis aspect metabolism rest grade dose epinephrine infusion without pancreatic islet clamp healthy non-obese men woman age 20-40 55-75 year , ( 2 ) evaluate relationship metabolic response epinephrine insulin portally nonportally-drained visceral subcutaneous adipose tissue mass individual , ( 3 ) delineate effect acute chronic exercise lipolytic metabolic response epinephrine insulin adipose tissue distribution healthy young old men woman , ( 4 ) investigate whether 7 day 12 month estrogen cyclic progesterone replacement therapy placebo healthy 55-75 year old woman alter lipolytic metabolic response epinephrine insulin adipose tissue distribution . The rate lipolysis , oxygen uptake , fat carbohydrate oxidation , total triglyceride-free fatty acid ( FFA ) substrate cycling determine indirect calorimetry gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis blood sample obtain infusion stable isotope tracer [ D5 ] glycerol [ 1 -13C ] palmitate baseline state , pancreatic islet clamp half male female participant , participant subsequent 4-stage grade dose epinephrine infusion . These data express relation total body wieght , fat mass , fat-free mass , assess measurement body density make hydrostatic weighing . Adipose tissue distribution characterize determination cross-sectional area volume portally nonportally-drained visceral subcutaneous fat deposit identify radiographic density criterion compute tomographic scan obtain level nipple , umbilicus , gluteal region , midthigh . Insulin action glucose disposal assess hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp . Age gender difference interaction exercise plasma epinephrine concentration baseline state submaximally maximally stimulate rate epinephrine infustion evaluate analysis variance covariance . Relationships effect estrogen treatment exercise adipose tissue distribution response epinephrine insulin assess multiple regression analysis . We hypothesize increased age associate low epinephrine-induced rate lipolysis , fat oxidation , triglyceride-FFA substrate cycling decrease insulin action men woman express relation total fat mass . We hypothesize age-related difference least partly ameliorate exercise training treatment estrogen conjunction decrease visceral abdominal total body adiposity .</detailed_description>
