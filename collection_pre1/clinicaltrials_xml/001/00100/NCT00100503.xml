	<brief_summary>This study examine therapy change way brain control movement child cerebral palsy . Normally , one side brain control movement opposite side body . In cerebral palsy , however , pattern may different , one side brain control movement side body . This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) study brain function child cerebral palsy therapy . Children 9 17 year age spastic hemiplegia type cerebral palsy recruit study National Rehabilitation Hospital Georgetown University Center Medical Center Washington , D.C. , Sparks Center UAB Alabama . In addition , five healthy control child recruit community group , Cub Scouts , Brownies , school . Candidates screen review medical record neurological physical examination . Healthy control undergo MRI ( describe ) twice , 3 week apart . Children cerebral palsy undergo follow test procedure : 1 . Rehabilitation evaluation NIH Clinical Center Rehabilitation Medicine Department . 2 . MRI : For test , child lie table slide MRI scanner-a metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . He wear earplugs muffle loud knock sound occur scan . Images obtain child performs simple finger tap movement . 3 . Movement Testing : 1 . Finger tapping : The child tap button box hooked computer 2 . Muscle reflex measurement : One method use small motor make child 's finger move sudden , small movement ; second method use small shock finger wrist . The shock feel like buzz ; gentle , might feel strong . 4 . TMS : This procedure map brain function . A wire coil hold scalp , brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . During stimulation , child may ask perform simple movements.. The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg , child may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . 5 . Therapy : After test , child randomly select receive either standard therapy ( neurodevelopmental treatment ) constraint-induced therapy , follow : 1 . Neurodevelopmental therapy use principle movement science enhance child 's capacity function . The child receive therapy time week 3 week . 2 . Constraint-induced therapy use combination motor learn method constraint teach new motor skills child 's affected hand . Children treat therapy must live near special treatment center Alabama 3 week treatment . The child 's good arm constrain bivalve , removable cast . The cast place therapy start remain place except therapist remove day examine good arm . With cast , child encourage use affected hand new way . The therapist us motor learn method , build motor program result practice , teach new skill . Motor learn therapy 6 hour day . 6 . Post-treatment testing : After treatment , child undergo repeat rehabilitation assessment , MRI , TMS , movement testing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Reorganization Following Constraint-Induced Therapy Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine underlie brain reorganization occur child hemiplegic cerebral palsy pediatric Constraint-Induced therapy . Background : A promising new therapy adult hemiparesis consequent stroke , know Constraint-Induced Movement ( CI ) therapy , recently modify use child cerebral palsy . Children cerebral palsy treat CI therapy show significant gain motor skill receive intensive extend treatment . There evidence suggest , acute stroke adult , undamaged motor cortex exert great control movement affect hand normally see neurologically intact subject . While might seem advantage , combine functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) study demonstrate associate poor motor recovery adult stroke impaired hand function patient cerebral palsy . Thus , anomalous motor control affect hand unaffected cortex may reflect less efficient cortical reorganization process . There controversy CI therapy produce improvement motor function . Conflicting evidence fMRI TMS study adult patient stroke show patient may either increase ipsilateral motor cortical activation increase activation damage hemisphere . The answer controversy may relate presence ipsilateral projection . Since ipsilateral projection associate bad functional outcome , determine type response CI therapy may give insight patient need intense therapy . Subject Population : Children hemiplegic subtype cerebral palsy ; age-matched child neurological abnormality Design : We assess motor cortex activation CI therapy use fMRI neurophysiologic test include TMS muscle reflex study child hemiplegic cerebral palsy without evidence ipsilateral projection . Outcome measure : Patients stratify presence mirror movement . Primary outcome measure laterality index cortical activation fMRI CI therapy . Secondary outcome measure standardize measure sensory motor function . We examine relationship presence anomalous ipsilateral motor control cortical reorganization follow CI therapy . Significance : Understanding relationship essential plan large randomize controlled trial . Since anomalous ipsilateral cortical reorganization reflect inefficient cortical reorganization process , treatment outcome CI therapy may also worse group . In case , future study may need stratify child study entry accord type brain reorganization .</detailed_description>
