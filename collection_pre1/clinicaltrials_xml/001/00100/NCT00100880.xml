	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate MTD oral CC-5013 administer child recurrent refractory primary CNS tumor daily 21 day 28 day course . II . To describe toxicity profile define dose-limiting toxicity CC-5013 child recurrent refractory primary CNS tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetics CC-5013 child adolescent . II . To characterize pharmacogenetics CC-5013 child adolescent . III . To evaluate change circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) circulate endothelial cell precursor ( CEPs ) patient treat CC-5013 , investigate correlation change CECs CEPs , plasma , serum urine level protein associate angiogenesis include thrombospondin , b-FGF , TNF-α , IL-12 , IL-8 VEGF , correlate change change MR perfusion clinical outcome . IV . To evaluate change MR perfusion diffusion treatment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 2-3 patient receive escalate dos lenalidomide maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose estimate 25 % patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . All patient follow least 30 day last dose lenalidomide . Patients treatment-related toxicity follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
