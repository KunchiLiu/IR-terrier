Attending physicians in-house normal business hour on-call home night . A MICU Fellow always available in-house . Suitable candidate study could include critically ill patient diagnostic therapeutic dilemma , unusual presentation disease , disease require novel therapy available CC . Because inter-hospital transfer critically ill may increase patient risk , patient accept likely medical benefit outweighs risk transfer risk transfer think acceptable refer accept physician . Critically ill patient represent vulnerable population serious illness may affect ability make decision . They must identify durable power attorney designate decision making , prior transfer CC . The risk study include risk transfer critically ill patient one facility another risk standard accept medical care . There may benefit participation study . In addition care available enrollment protocol , patient may also enroll NIH protocol wish . The establishment protocol provide mean evaluate treat patient , generate hypothesis protocol base clinical experience critical illness .</detailed_description>
