	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate combination gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib ( R115777 ) patient metastatic breast cancer . II . To evaluate duration response , time disease progression patient metastatic breast cancer treat combination gemcitabine tipifarnib ( R115777 ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study tipifarnib follow phase II study . Patients receive tipifarnib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 .
