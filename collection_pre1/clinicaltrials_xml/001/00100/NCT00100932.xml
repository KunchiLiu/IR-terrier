	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis nonsmall cell lung cancer least one site measurable disease RECIST criterion . Patients must fail prior platinumcontaining doublet chemotherapy . Patients receive single agent chemotherapy without subsequent taxane contain regimen may enrol discussion Sponsor . Patients must ≥ 18 year age . Patients must performance score 0 1 use ECOG performance scale . Patients must life expectancy ≥ 3 month . Patients must adequate renal function evidence serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min per Cockcroft Gault formula . Patients must adequate hepatic function evidence bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL alkaline phosphatase , AST ALT ≤ 3 time upper limit normal , unless evidence liver metastasis , case alkaline phosphatase , AST ALT must ≤ 5 time upper limit normal . Patients must adequate bone marrow function evidence absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 X 10^9/L , hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL ( hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 g/dL would acceptable corrected growth factor transfusion ) , platelet count ≥ 100 X 10^9/L . Patients must willing able comply protocol guideline duration study . Patients must willing able complete Lung Cancer Symptom Scale ( LCSS ) instrument . The biopsy specimen ( paraffin block least 10 unstained slide ) must available either initial diagnosis subsequent diagnostic surgical procedure patient participate pharmacogenomics substudy . However , additional biopsy obligatory participation study except require confirmation diagnosis . Patients must give write informed consent prior studyspecific screening procedure understand patient may withdraw consent time without prejudice . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients preexist peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 2 Patients require therapeutic dos warfarin Patients recover chemotherapy , radiation therapy relate toxicity deem clinically significant study entry Patients active symptomatic brain metastasis . Patients central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases consider eligible adequately treat brain metastasis , i.e . complete treatment ( tapered steroid ) least four week start treatment E7389 . Patients evidence metastasis symptomatic actively grow ( evidence midline shift CT scan MRI ) may enrol without initiation local therapy CNS metastasis . In case , repeat scan must perform within four week original scan ensure disease progression occur . It intention study treat patient active brain metastasis . Patients positive history HIV , active hepatitis B active hepatitis C. Patients significant medical , psychiatric disorder , opinion investigator , exclude patient study compliance safety reason Patients receive investigational drug , include immunotherapy , gene therapy , hormone therapy ( except megestrol acetate appetite stimulation ) , biological therapy ; conventional chemotherapy radiation therapy ( except palliation , define less 10 % bone marrow reserve le 20 Gy ) , within three week E7839 enrollment Patients receive noncytotoxics ( eg , gefitinib , erlotinib ) within one week E7389 enrollment Patients recover major surgery within three week E7389 enrollment Patients severe/uncontrolled intercurrent illness/infection Patients significant cardiovascular impairment ( history congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA grade II , unstable angina myocardial infarction within past six month , serious cardiac arrhythmia ) Patients organ allografts Patients hypersensitivity halichondrin B and/or halichondrin Brelated compound Patients participate prior E7389 clinical trial Patients second malignancy within past 5 year , except carcinoma situ cervix basal cell carcinoma skin Women pregnant breastfeeding ; woman childbearing potential positive pregnancy test screening pregnancy test . Women childbearing potential unless ( 1 ) surgically sterile ( 2 ) use adequate measure contraception opinion Investigator .
