	<brief_summary>This study examine pancreatic tumor tissue immune cell patient pancreatic tumor look marker cell may useful develop new treatment disease . Patients 16 year age old evidence primary pancreatic tumor surgically remove may eligible study . Types pancreatic tumor include trial pancreatic cancer , adenosquamous carcinoma , anaplastic carcinoma , IPMN ( intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasm ) , acinar cell carcinoma , pancreaticoblastoma , mucinous cystic neoplasm , serous cystic neoplasm , solid-pseudopapillary cystic neoplasm , squamous cell carcinoma , Vater ( ampullary tumor ) duodenal adenoma cancer common bile duct tumor ( cholangiocarcinoma . ) The specific type tumor determine operation . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) chest , abdomen , pelvis , blood urine test , electrocardiogram . Patients older 50 year age patient history cardiovascular disease may also thallium cardiac stress test . Participants undergo standard treatment pancreatic tumor , include surgery remove tumor . Before , , operation , several blood sample draw part routine patient care research test . During surgery , small piece tumor tissue take examination microscope grow cell laboratory tumor immune cell study . Some patient may undergo leukapheresis collect large number white blood cell study . For procedure , blood collect needle arm vein flow catheter ( plastic tube ) machine separate component centrifugation ( spin ) . The white cell extract rest blood ( plasma , red cell , platelet ) return another needle arm . Patients require additional treatment , chemotherapy radiation , may treat NIH another protocol refer appropriate treatment elsewhere .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Effective standard treatment option currently available exocrine pancreas carcinomas . Adenocarcinoma pancreas , frequent exocrine tumor , fourth lead cause cancer relate death men woman country . - Immunotherapy melanoma study Surgery Branch result striking tumor regression patient . - Procurement lymphocytes tumor patient pancreas cancer facilitate identification tumor-associated antigen lead rational extension adoptive therapy vaccination direct disease . Objectives : - Primary Objective : To obtain tissue , tumor lymphocyte , use identify tumor antigen specific various histology pancreas ampullary cancer along HLA restrict epitope antigen . - Secondary Objective : To treat patient resectable pancreas neoplasm use standard pancreatic resection follow survival . Eligibility : - Any patient great equal to16 year age radiographic endoscopic evidence pancreatic mass , ampullary mass malignant stricture without evidence distant metastasis - Patients must ECOG performance score 0-2 . - Patients must laboratory physical examination parameter within acceptable limit standard practice guideline prior biopsy surgery . Design : - A tissue acquisition trial tissue obtain time surgical operation resection pancreas exocrine tumor . - Tissue process Surgery Branch Cell process lab accordance standard practice . - No investigational therapy give . - It anticipate 180 patient enrol 7 year .</detailed_description>
