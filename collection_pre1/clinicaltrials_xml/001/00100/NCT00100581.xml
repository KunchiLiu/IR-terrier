	<brief_summary>A significant proportion HIV infect people U.S. also infect hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . The purpose study determine effect anti-HIV therapy treatment HCV pegylated interferon alfa-2a ribavirin ( PEG/RBV ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Anti-HIV Therapy Treatment Hepatitis C HCV/HIV Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimate 15 % 30 % HIV infected people U.S. also infect HCV . Since introduction antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) treatment HIV , HCV infection emerge major cause morbidity mortality HCV/HIV coinfected patient . One infection often accelerate progression , effective management strategy infection need develop HCV/HIV coinfected patient . This study determine whether HIV ART follow HCV therapy take concurrently ART result well treatment outcome compare HCV therapy alone . This study last 102 week . Participants randomly assign one two arm . Arm A participant receive 24 30 week ART consist tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) lamivudine ( 3TC ) either efavirenz ( EFV ) lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) . If deem eligible , Arm A participant continue ART regimen begin concurrent PEG/RBV regimen 48 week . At Week 48 , participant Arm A stop PEG/RBV follow additional 24 week ART alone . Arm B participant receive PEG/RBV alone 48 week . At Week 48 , participant Arm B follow additional 48 week treatment . There 20 study visit 102 week Arm A participant 18 study visit 96 week Arm B participant . Blood collection clinical assessment occur visit , urine collection occur select visit . Participants also ask complete adherence questionnaire . Participants study encourage also enroll ACTG A5128 .</detailed_description>
