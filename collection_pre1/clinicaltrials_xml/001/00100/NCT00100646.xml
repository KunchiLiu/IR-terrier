	<brief_summary>HIV infected people often must take anti-HIV drug long period , lead long-term drug exposure toxicity . Interruptions anti-HIV therapy , also know structured treatment interruption ( STIs ) , may negative health effect may helpful overall long-term health HIV-infected people . The purpose study determine sequential short-term STIs antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) HIV infected individual resource-constrained environment retain immune reconstitution benefit continuous treatment potentially lessen rate toxicity associate continuous therapy strategy time , lessen cost associate ART .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Long-term toxicity high cost medication two problem face HIV infected people take ART . Previous study HIV-infected patient suggest ART STIs may decrease drug exposure lessen long-term drug toxicity , sacrifice viral suppression patient health . This study determine ART STIs maintain level immune function HIV-infected people continuous ART . This study recruit patient South Africa . This study last 3.5 year . At study entry , participant begin daily ART consist lamivudine , lopinavir/ritonavir , stavudine . At Month 6 , participant respond well ART ( CD4 count great 450 cells/uL viral load le 50 copies/ml Month 6 ) randomly assign one two group . Group 1 participant participate STIs therapy , Group 2 participant receive continuous therapy . People Group 1 treatment interruption 2 , 4 , 8 week duration 16-week period ART . Group 1 participant re-initiate therapy CD4 count drop 350 cell evidence clinical disease progression present . Group 2 participant continue take ART throughout study . At screen , participant undergo medical history assessment , physical exam , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan . There least 22 study visit occur approximately every 8 week , last 45 60 minute . At study visit , participant require bring remain pill adherence assess undergo medical assessment . Blood collection occur nearly visit . For female participant , urine collection occur visit . Participants receive rabies vaccination Weeks 16 , 17 , 22 . A visit Week 92 include MRI participant receive rabies vaccine booster .</detailed_description>
