	<brief_summary>The objective study identify immune intervention strategy preserve residual beta cell function onset type 1 diabetes . Scientific evidence develop last 10 - 20 year suggest type 1 diabetes chronic , slowly progressive autoimmune disease clinical symptom develop least 80 % - 90 % beta cell mass destroy result autoimmune process . It recognize preservation remain beta cell clinically important ability secrete , even small amount insulin , make disease easy control help minimize complication associate year inadequate glycemic control . This clinical trial first series study launch TrialNet Study Group test various intervention preserve residual beta cell function new onset type 1 diabetes . Specifically , study design determine ability Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF/CellCept ) use alone , combination Daclizumab ( DZB/Zenapax ) see possible stop immune system destroy beta cell new onset type 1 diabetes patient ( within 3 month diagnosis . ) Researchers make great stride understand immune system work change activity immune cell medicine call immunotherapy . Some immunotherapy work make immune system less active . Scientists discover key immune cell , call T cell , help cause type 1 diabetes . These T cell largely responsible attack beta cell produce insulin . Doctors find medicine slow suppress activity T cell . It hop immunosuppressive medicine help treat type 1 diabetes stop T cell destroy beta cell . Medicines make immune system less active developed study disease . Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) Daclizumab ( DZB ) two medicine . Their effect immune system well understood . Researchers believe medicine may lessen immune system 's destruction beta cell lead type 1 diabetes . In addition , researcher hope effect medicine last long therapy . The goal study find two medicine able stop ongoing destruction beta cell still function time type 1 diabetes diagnose . The two immunosuppressive medication test Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF/CellCept® ) Daclizumab ( DZB/Zenapax® ) . They work make immune system less active . TrialNet researcher hope medication help maintain insulin secretion remain beta cell thus help maintain good glycemic control . Even medication work , study participant still need take insulin injection may make easy control normal blood sugar level help reduce long-term complication diabetes blindness , kidney failure , nerve damage , heart attack stroke . The aim arrest beta cell destruction newly diabetic subject immune modulation may work well alone autoimmune process progress complete near complete destruction beta cell . The study 's rationale demonstrate meaningful preservation islet function minimal immune system side effect 4-year course study . The data clinical trial could serve basis large trial result sufficiently positive , could suggest combine intervention trial might achieve either good efficacy potentially preserve C-peptide without need continue immunosuppression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Onset Type 1 Diabetes Mycophenolate Mofetil-Daclizumab Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design Study : The study multi-center , three-arm , randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled clinical trial . Comparisons make among three group , : - Mycophenolate mofetil active drug Daclizumab ( DZB ) placebo IV - Mycophenolate mofetil active drug active Daclizumab IV - Mycophenolate mofetil placebo Daclizumab placebo IV Participants agree enroll study ask take study medication two year . MMF give mouth twice day . DZB give intravenous infusion twice , time enrollment two week later . Both medication approve U.S. Food Drug Administration use people receive organ transplant . This study test new use medication preserve insulin secretion delay stop destruction insulin-secreting cell people newly diagnose type 1 diabetes . Both MMF DZB make immune system less active . Participants monitor closely possible side effect occur take either DZB and/or MMF due decrease activity immune system . Participants need go Clinical Center visit test . For first month participant come every week ; participant come month 2 month 3 . After month 3 visit , visit occur every three month . At visit , blood drawn participant meet study physician review overall diabetes management , monitor possible side-effects study medication . Participants ask longer test call Mixed Meal Tolerance Test ( MMTT ) initial visit five additional visit take assigned study medication . The MMTT involve drink special drink control amount carbohydrate , protein , fat measure residual insulin secretion . The test require IV inserted arm blood sample take IV period 2 4 hour . After complete two year period take study medication , participant ask return every 3-6 month additional 1-2 year evaluate ability secrete insulin discontinue study medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Potential participant must meet follow inclusion criterion : Be within 3months diagnosis type 1 diabetes base American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) criterion Be age 8 45 year old Must stimulate Cpeptide level &gt; 0.2 pmol/ml ( measure MMTT administer one month prior date randomization ) Must either detectable antiGAD , antiICA512/IA2 , insulin autoantibody ( unless receive insulin therapy 7 day ) , islet cell autoantibody . [ The reason inclusion enrollment criterion avoid inclusion patient `` Type 1B diabetes mellitus '' , may involve immunologic criterion measure assay utilize . ] If participant reproductive potential , must agreeable effective form birth control ( unless abstinence choose method ) . If participant female reproductive potential , must willing undergo pregnancy test report possible confirm pregnancy promptly course MMF/DZB study . Must willing comply intensive diabetes management . The goal management HbA1c 7.0 % participant , regardless age . Participants expect take sufficient number daily insulin shot meet goal . Alternatively , participant use insulin pump therapy . Participants also expect test blood sugar least 34 time per day . There Certified Diabetes Educator work study participant achieve goal . Potential participant must meet follow exclusion criterion : Have complicate medical issue would interfere blood draw monitoring . Have Body Mass Index ( BMI ) great 95th percentile age gender . Have serologic evidence HIV infection . Have serologic evidence Hepatitis B infection . Have serologic evidence Hepatitis C infection . Have abnormal liver function test . Have history leukopenia and/or neutropenia . Have history chronic peptic ulcer disease , erosive esophagitis , chronic inflammatory bowel disease and/or chronic colonic disease . Have positive PPD test result . Have live vaccination precede 6 week ( e.g . MMRsecond dose , live flu vaccine , varicella vaccine , live polio vaccine , yellow fever vaccine ) . Resides outside reasonable geographical proximity clinic ( i.e. , residence outside state Investigator study reside , residence outside immediately neighbor state , residence outside area Investigator considers reasonable ) . It leave Investigator 's discretion decide patient 's geographical residence prohibitive complete study participation . Require chronic use steroid immunosuppressive agent condition . Be currently pregnant 3 month postpartum . Be currently nurse within 6 week complete nursing . Anticipate get pregnant , father child , study .</criteria>
