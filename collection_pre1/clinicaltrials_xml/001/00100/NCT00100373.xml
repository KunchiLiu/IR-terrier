	<detailed_description>Respiratory infection major cause morbidity mortality elderly . Recently , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) show account significant portion illness . The causative factor associate severe RSV disease elderly well understood . The contribution viral load , host inflammatory response cellular immune response disease pathogenesis unknown . A good understanding process may useful development vaccine therapeutic RSV disease . Although adult group high risk serious RSV disease elderly high-risk adult , propose use challenge model young healthy adult determine optimal time specimen collection feasibility perform certain test move ahead target group natural infection . The purpose study measure immune response ( body fight infection ) experimental preparation live Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV . Participants include 20 healthy adult age 21-40 . Study procedure include draw blood , urine sample , respiratory exam , vital sign temperature , diary card , nasal mucus weight nasal wash swab . All participant receive vaccine via nose drop .

Prechallenge serum neutralize titer RSV A2 microneutalization ( MNA ) &lt; /= 1:657 ( 9.36 log2 ) Nonsmoker No significant health abnormality detect evaluation medical history , general physical examination , vital sign laboratory test . Willingness remain isolation 11 night comply study requirement . Willingness remain Rochester area 28 day study . Volunteers follow condition eligible participate : Chronic medical condition require medical followup within last 6 month . Serologic evidence infection HIV hepatitis C virus , presence hepatitis B surface antigen serum . History medically document asthma require treatment ( include overthecounter medication ) time . Any abnormal laboratory result would render challenge RSV unsafe interfere interpretation subject 's response challenge , e.g. , AST , ALT , Bilirubin , BUN , creatinine . ( see Appendix II ) Individuals require concurrent therapy medication likely interfere evaluation response infection , e.g . antipyretic , antiinflammatory medication Close contact child age less 2 year , individual significant immunosuppression , individual great 65 year age . Health care worker patient contact two week follow challenge Pregnancy uncertain status regard pregnancy Acute respiratory infection fever within 1 week challenge Previous enrollment study evaluate RSV challenge virus RSV vaccine . Known glucose intolerance ( history abnormal glucose tolerance test medical history diabetes mellitus ) . History chronic obstructive disease , emphysema serious evolve pulmonary disease . Any condition opinion investigator might interfere study objective pose excessive risk subject . History previous hospitalization pulmonary condition ( ie . Pneumonia , asthma , spontaneous pneumothorax , severe sinus disease require surgical procedure . History frequent serious bacterial infection associate low white blood cell count ( 4,000 per microgram )</criteria>
