	<brief_title>Irinotecan Treating Patients With Metastatic Inoperable Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate patient metastatic inoperable locoregional medullary thyroid cancer treat irinotecan . Secondary - Determine safety tolerability drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive irinotecan IV day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Response assess completion 4 course . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR PR . Patients stable disease receive 12 total course . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 33 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
