	<detailed_description>Objective : Our previous VA-funded study find chronic fatigue report Gulf War veteran may symptom dysfunctional cardiovascular stress response regulation . Specifically , ill veteran diminish autonomic response task involve high brain activity , include cognitive processing psychosocial stress . Gulf veteran posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) dampen autonomic activation stressor involve high brain activity . There close relationship clinical status ill veteran inability mount appropriate physiological response stress . The main objective present investigation determine specific mechanism abnormality may contribute Gulf War-related chronic fatigue . The second major focus study explore role stress military deployment contribute factor post-Gulf War illness . Research Plan : The research plan establish mechanism blood pressure hyporeactivity Gulf War veterans chronic fatigue PTSD . Two possibility examine : one , abnormal cardiovascular response stressor involve reduce responsiveness major cardiovascular effector system , peripheral arterial vasculature heart , sympathetic stimulation ; two , locus abnormality brain , result inadequate activation sympathetic nervous system stressful behavioral activity . The role wartime stress examine specifically focus abnormality stress response regulation associate Gulf War-related PTSD . Methods : This study perform four group Gulf War veteran , include symptom fulfill 1994 CDC case definition chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) , PTSD , CFS PTSD , healthy control veteran . A total 90 veteran study . The study protocol use standard laboratory procedure characterize abnormality regulation cardiovascular function use selective pharmacological behavioral challenge . Performance central mechanism sympathetic activation mental challenge evaluate measuring increase plasma catecholamine , epinephrine norepinephrine , social-evaluative speech stressor . Collected plasma sample analyze use high performance liquid chromatography assay . The hypothesis target organ dysfunction evaluate use grade intravenous infusion two drug , phenylephrine dobutamine , measure resultant cardiovascular response . Phenylephrine dobutamine synthetic catecholamine , analogue endogenous chemical messenger substance release sympathetic nerve fiber adrenal medulla stress response activation . Phenylephrine alpha-adrenergic agonist increase blood pressure constrict peripheral blood vessel . Dobutamine beta-adrenergic agonist stimulates myocardium increase force contraction cardiac output . Stimulus-response curve vasoconstrictor inotropic adrenergic receptor mechanism construct , measure vasomotor cardiac function , autonomic reflex mechanism derive . Clinical Relevance : Our research suggest biomedical marker Gulf veterans illness characterize severe unexplained chronic fatigue -- diminish cardiovascular reactivity cognitive stressor . Although problem serve veteran fatigue illness , worst subset veteran also PTSD . Our data also suggest markedly diminish cardiovascular response stress exhibit group may contribute functional impairment . The present investigation determine ( 1 ) whether impairment due PTSD , medical disorder unexplained severe fatigue , interaction two diagnosis , ( 2 ) system blood pressure regulation lie cause abnormal stress response . This work , therefore , may lead good understanding cause Gulf War Illnesses well way treat .</detailed_description>
