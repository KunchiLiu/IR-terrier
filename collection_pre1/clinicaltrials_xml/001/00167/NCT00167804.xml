	<detailed_description>Combat relate Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) common chronic psychiatric disorder veteran population . PTSD often disable characterize intrusive re-experiencing traumatic memory , avoidance/numbing , increase arousal . An estimated 830,000 veteran currently chronic PTSD symptom . The VA set 145 specialized PTSD program . Unfortunately , outcome study VA PTSD program fail show efficacy . VA PTSD patient significantly less responsive conventional therapy PTSD population include traditional Imaginal Exposure Therapy . Virtual Reality base exposure therapy ( VRE ) allow patient feel immersed highly interactive computer-generated environment . Within environment patient expose anxiety-provoking stimulus gradual control manner become desensitized stimulus , case PTSD , traumatic memory evoke stimulus . VRE therapy produce significant lasting reduction PTSD symptom Vietnam veteran ( N=14 ) two open trial Atlanta VA. Two case study successful PTSD treatment ( one Boston VA 9/11 survivor ) provide additional support VRE . The advantage VRE include less reliance patient 's ability visualize traumatic memory make difficult patient avoid memory exposure therapy . It also safer convenient vivo exposure . The propose study would randomly assign twenty Vietnam veterans either VRE Treatment Usual ( TAU ) control condition . Treatment would consist ten ninety-minute individual psychotherapy session group . Assessments would occur pre-treatment , immediate post-treatment six month post-treatment . VRE would use Virtual Vietnam computer generate environment desensitize patient one two traumatic combat related memory . VRE patient would wear Head Mounted Display ( HMD ) fit eyes ear . While HMD patient look stereoscopic computer display receive audio input set headphone . Patients report strong sense present Vietnam-like place environment . The therapist constant contact patient microphone connect HMD . Patients recount traumatic experience therapist augments description visual auditory combat-related stimulus appropriate moment time . The therapist control , moment-by-moment basis , type intensity VR exposure . The goal provide necessary level stimulus help patient become engaged enough , long enough , desensitize traumatic memory without become overwhelm either external stimulus provide VR internal stimulus traumatic memory . In TAU condition therapy focus `` here-and-now '' issue problem solve focus type VA PTSD patient usually receive . The primary outcome measure Clinician Administered PTSD Scale . An Independent Assessor blind patient ' treatment condition conduct assessment . To insure patient safety , Scale Suicide Ideation administer condition week . Patients pay $ 75 two post-treatment assessment . The hypothesis : ( 1 ) VRE produce significant reduction PTSD symptom ; ( 2 ) VRE significantly effective TAU ; ( 3 ) VRE symptom reduction maintain six-month follow-up assessment . VRE may powerful new tool treatment PTSD . Controlled study , like one propose , need explore utility .</detailed_description>
