	<brief_summary>The biomechanics change direction walk largely neglect despite relevancy functional mobility . In addition , increase risk injury associate turn due decrease stability . The objective study understand biomechanics turn gait sample population intact trans-tibial amputee capacity prosthetic component facilitate transverse plane movement . The clinical impact investigation development intervention increase functional mobility , stability safety turn . The researcher propose investigate three set hypotheses . The first set address fundamental biomechanical mechanism associate walk along circular trajectory , intact subject differ amputee , effect rotation adaptor pylon . The second set hypothesis address dynamic stability potential influence prosthetic intervention . The third set hypothesis address rotational property prosthetic pylon influence comfort mobility daily activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Most known amputee walk property prosthetic component affect gait discover sagittal plane observation amputees walk back forth along straight line . Abnormal limb loading , think principal factor occurrence residual limb pain turn may cause instability limit mobility , certainly occur walk straight line . However , incidence abnormal limb load likely amplified perform complex gait activity , turn avoid obstacle ; activity common everyday life . The specific aim investigation : 1. discover biomechanical strategy use stability intact individual trans-tibial amputee walk along circular trajectory 2. explore effect prosthetic intervention turn biomechanics , stability , comfort , mobility . We propose investigate three set hypotheses : The first set hypothesis address fundamental biomechanical mechanism associate walk along circular trajectory , intact subject differ amputee , effect rotation adaptor pylon . We conduct experiment test three hypothesis related achieve change heading , orientation , balance centripetal force necessary walk along circular trajectory . The second set hypothesis seek identify whether trans-tibial amputee rigid pylon unstable turn task non-amputees whether rotation adaptor enhance stability . We conduct experiment calculate index dynamic stability measure rate person respond perturbation return stable gait pattern . The third set hypothesis address rotational property prosthetic pylon influence comfort mobility daily activity . To measure comfort mobility , solicit questionnaire response step count measure amputees one-month period wear rigid pylon one-month period wear transverse plane rotation adaptor ( within-subject comparison ) . In addition field measurement , also compare distance travel six-minute walk . Patient opinion prosthesis mobility measure long period time play significant role prosthesis evaluation . For veteran amputee experience discomfort increase risk residual limb skin problem , seem reasonable suppose problem might occur walk along curve trajectory rather straight line . The joint force moment turn may differ significantly exhibit walk straight line . The propose research create new knowledge base understand prosthetic intervention effectiveness . The immediate clinical impact trans-tibial amputee determination transverse plane rotational adapter pylon improve comfort , mobility , stability .</detailed_description>
