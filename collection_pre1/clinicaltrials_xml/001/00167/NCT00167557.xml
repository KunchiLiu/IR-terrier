	<brief_summary>After liver transplant , hepatitis C virus ( destroyed one 's liver ) eventually come back . In many patient , eventually cause loss new liver also confuse doctor take care hard tell difference one 's body reject new liver hepatitis . This cause serious treatment error lead severe hepatitis rejection liver . Some drug use prevent rejection one 's new liver cause hepatitis come back severe form . This especially true drug know corticosteroid . Right , effective treatment hepatitis C combination two drug call interferon ribavirin . These drug act strengthen one 's immune system fight virus directly reduce reproduction virus . Because treatment drug associate many side effect , little experience treat patient liver transplantation . In investigator ' transplant program , decide treat patient hepatitis C early possible transplantation follow closely development hepatitis side effect treatment . The investigator treat one 's hepatitis early possible , actual damage occur new liver . This approach try hard tell work . The main reason failure many patient could complete treatment due side effect . The investigator ' purpose treat side effect aggressively patient complete treatment course . The purpose study collect data regard investigator ' treatment protocol able learn form treatment beneficial . The study include perform liver biopsy schedule time one 's liver transplant schedule blood test see much virus still blood . If patient show sign respond treatment remove study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Orthotopic Liver Transplant ( OLT ) Recipients With Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Under Preemptive Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HCV recurs transplant liver almost invariably . The clinical course variable range hepatitis severe aggressive hepatitis cirrhosis . Factors affect outcome high viral load prior OLT , genotype , immunosuppressive regimen . Recent study indicate severity recurrence increase long follow , longevity graft patient compromise HCV . Viral load appear particularly affected corticosteroid . The impact mycophenolate mofetil tacrolimus certain . The result re-transplantation generally poor seem non-cost beneficial way deal recurrence HCV cirrhosis . Additionally , re-transplantation deprives patient get OLT timely fashion . Recent study show intensive alpha interferon ribavirin treatment , 40 % patient clear virus measure PCR . Thus , despite cost side effect treatment , appear justified treat recurrence preemptively . Due deleterious effect high dose Corticosteroids seem logical attempt withdraw soon possible treatment . MMF often incompatible interferon ribavirin treatment due leukopenia anemia . The true sirolimus . Thus , patient eventually treat Tacrolimus monotherapy . Presently , numerous patient end treat Tacrolimus monotherapy part reduction immune suppression , occurs time . There , however , little prospective data regard Tacrolimus monotherapy almost data specific issue monotherapy HCV patient . Even less known respect type treatment use interferon ribavirin . Our purpose protocol examine effect preemptive antiviral treatment recurrent HCV effect Tacrolimus monotherapy set . This may important program turn preemptive anti viral treatment issue appropriate immune suppression become seminal discussion . Aims 1 . To determine safety efficacy PEG interferon ribavirin treatment HCV recurrence OLT . 2 . To determine effectiveness safety maintenance dose PEG interferon delay progression fibrosis histologic damage , non-responders initial regimen PEG interferon ribavirin . 3 . To determine effect early prednisone withdrawal rate response treatment PEG interferon ribavirin . 4 . To assess feasibility Tacrolimus monotherapy patient undergoing treatment HCV recurrence post transplant .</detailed_description>
