	<brief_title>The Use Platelet Derived Growth Factors Total Knee Arthroplasty , Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The short-term functional recovery total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) largely dependent initial wound healing . Haematoma formation may lead prolonged wound drainage tissue necrosis1 , negative effect early range motion , post-operative pain length hospital stay . In addition , study suggest prolonged wound drainage also lead high infection rate . To decrease haematoma formation , primary soft tissue homeostasis adequate tissue repair essential . During immediate reaction tissue injury , haemostasis inflammation occur . Growth factor , especially PDGF ( platelet derive growth factor ) TGF-β ( transform growth factor-beta ) , play crucial role biochemical cascade site repair . These growth factor mostly derive platelet . They act chemotactic agent polymorphonuclear leucocyte , macrophage , fibroblast lymphocyte . Both factor stimulate angiogenesis fibroplasia . PDGF also role wound contraction remodel . When apply large concentration growth factor wind , faster tissue repair homeostasis expect , thus lead less haematoma formation . Treatment autologous platelet concentrate involve direct application concentrate platelet , growth factor fibrin operation wound . A small volume ( 55-110 ml ) patient ’ blood take derive platelet rich gel spray directly wound . The objective study evaluate effect autologous platelet concentrate blood loss ( post-operative decrease haemoglobin concentration ) , wind heal complication , range motion , pain reduction outcome score use total knee arthroplasty .</detailed_description>
