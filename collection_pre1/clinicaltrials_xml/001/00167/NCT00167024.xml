	<brief_title>Application Genetic Polymorphisms DNA Repair The Prediction Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Its Clinical Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DNA repair play key role carcinogenesis removal repair DNA damage induce endogenous environmental source . The DNA repair system include four pathway : 1 ) Base Excision Repair ( BER ) , 2 ) Nucleotide Excision Repair ( NER ) , 3 ) Mismatch Repair ( MMR ) 4 ) Double-Strand Break Repair , include homologous recombination pathway nonhomologous end-joining repair pathway . Decreased impaired DNA repair capacity report various cancer , however , effect prostate cancer still investigate . Common polymorphisms DNA repair gene may alter protein function individual ’ capacity repair damage DNA , hence , influence cancer susceptibility . Polymorphic variant DNA repair gene find associated cancer susceptibility , rare study investigate effect prostate cancer . Since variation function DNA repair gene also impact cancer cell ’ viability resistance treatment , genetic variant DNA repair might serve valuable biomarker forcasting result cancer treatment . In fact , report demonstrate association polymorphism DNA repair gene result treatment various cancer . For present study proposal , focus several DNA repair gene : X-ray repair cross- complement group 1 ( XRCC1 ) , human oxoguanine glycosylase I ( hOGG1 ) , xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group D ( XPD ) , hMSH2 , hMLH1 X-ray repair cross-complementing group 3 ( XRCC3 ) , might relevance prostate carcinogenesis base know function . XRCC1 involved DNA repair base excision pathway , hOGG1 gene encodes DNA glycosylase /apurinic-apyrimidinic lyase catalyze excision removal 8-OH-dG ( 8-hydroxy- 2-deoxyguanine ) - major form oxidative DNA damage . The XPD gene code DNA helicase involve transcription nucleotide excision repair . The hMSH2 hMLH1 gene involve mismatch repair . The XRCC3 gene encode protein double-strand break homologous recombinational repair pathway . In proposed study , also use PCR-based method investigate effect DNA repair gene polymorphisms prostate cancer susceptibility , pathological grade , disease stage clinical outcome . With effort , understand association DNA repair gene polymorphism prostate cancer provide important information screening , prevention treatment prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
