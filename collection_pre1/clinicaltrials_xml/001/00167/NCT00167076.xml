	<brief_title>Clinical Applications Evaluations A Portable In-Shoe Plantar Pressure Monitoring Biofeedback Gait System Ambulation Training Stroke Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke patient often suffer persistent physical , psychological , motor dysfunction , severely affect independence daily life . Therefore , restoration independent ambulatory ability one important goal stroke rehabilitation . To achieve goal , ambulation aid important necessary device assist ambulatory ability ambulation training . Whereas use ambulation assistive device promote early mobility facilitate early restoration function patient , improper prolong use device may inevitably cause negative training effect , patient may become over-dependent upon assistance offer device . The formation dependence would hinder progress stroke patient achieve ultimate goal independent walk without assistive device . To assess influence use ambulation assistive device , therefore imperative clinician closely subjectively evaluate gait pattern force production pattern patient walk ambulation aid . In addition , ambulation assistive device equip device pressure feedback function use assist ambulate also monitor patient 's level dependence device . The device pressure feedback information use train patient gradually reduce dependence device . To date , due limitation conventional laboratory method gait analysis , `` multi-footed '' gait pattern present stroke patient , walk ambulation aid , yet study biomechanical analysis . Moreover , whether use ambulation assistive device equip feedback function effectively improve stroke patient ' gait pattern ability achieve independent walking remain unknown . Answers question would provide important knowledge clinician base upon evaluate weight bear symmetry two low extremity stroke patient train effect use ambulation aid patient .</detailed_description>
