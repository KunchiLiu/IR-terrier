	<brief_title>Reducing Effects Malaria Children Administering Repeated Preventive Doses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 1.5 million death African child 5 year age due Plasmodium falciparum malaria . There urgent need available affordable strategy control malaria morbidity childhood . Malaria control measure assess potential reduce intensity infection order decrease risk malaria . It show malaria prevention use drug potentially capable reduce malaria morbidity , school absenteeism , all-cause mortality . However , prevention use drug first year life also result loss delay acquire resistance lead rebound phenomenon ( i.e . increase risk severe malaria therapy end ) . In recent study intermittent treatment Fansidar® 2 , 3 , 9 month age , number malaria case first 12 month life significantly reduce rebound effect observe . This study demonstrate intermittent administration Fansidar® safe beneficial effect child . However , effectiveness decreased month discontinue drug . The promising effect intermittent administration fansidar show study need confirm area different endemicity Lambaréné , Gabon . It assume extended intermittent application Fansidar® perform example would likely result long period protection malaria , extend intermittent administration Fansidar lead rebound effect result high occurrence malaria . The framework study offer unique opportunity study characteristic infectious disease importance Lambaréné area development resistance microbe maternofetal ( mother/foetus ) interface . Comparable study simultaneously take place two associate study site ( Kumasi Tamale ) different malaria endemicity Ghana , West Africa . Comparison : Comparison malaria attack child without intermittent Fansidar® treatment drug administration month 3 9 ( alongside routine vaccination deliver child vaccination programme ) additional administration month 15 .</detailed_description>
