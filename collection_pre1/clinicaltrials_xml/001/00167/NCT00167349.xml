	<brief_title>Cardiopulmonary Bypass Inflammatory Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute inflammatory response occur cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) patient clearly associate deleterious clinical outcome . Increasing understanding pathophysiology systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) follow CPB facilitate development strategy attenuate damaging effect cytokine-induced inflammation . For strategy test , one need clearly define understand inflammatory response occur CPB . Although extensively study , wide variation report time course magnitude response . This variation , part , due heterogeneous nature patient population study ( variable severity illness , ejection fraction , co-morbidities , etc. ) . Hence , study , propose study inflammatory response occur patient undergo coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) without use CPB institution , determine whether severity inflammatory response see CABG patient associated impairment specific clinical parameter immediate post-operative period ( i.e. , ventricular dysfunction , lung injury , bleeding , renal failure , etc ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients undergo CABG and/or patient undergoing procedure ( i.e. , valve surgery , myomectomy , etc . ) addition coronary revascularization Age : 18 year include 90 year Patient schedule undergo CABG surgery Ejection Fraction Â£ 30 % Chronic renal failure require hemodialysis Longterm steroid use prior surgery HIV positive patient ( HIV test require rule HIV ) Status post organ transplantation immune modulate drug Presence severe sepsis past month prior surgery Prisoners</criteria>
