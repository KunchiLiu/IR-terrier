	<brief_title>Pre- , Peri- Postnatal Programming Origins Disease : Early Targeting Epidemics Allergy Overweight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While allergic disease comprise common chronic disease childhood , obesity prevalent nutritional disorder among child throughout world . In Europe , estimate 20 % child adolescent overweight one-third consider obese . Moreover , escalation problem expect future , since velocity propagation high child . Although genetic factor determine propensity individual become allergic obese , unlikely explain recent progressive worldwide increase incidence . Rather , would appear environmental change directly shape risk critical period life scene set consolidation immune responder type . Prenatal environmental exposure may alter gene expression via epigenetic mechanism , heritable change gene expression occur without alteration DNA sequence . Specifically current research interest direct towards health promotion reduce risk disease evaluate probiotic effect specific food nutrient , assess interaction optimal combination food matrix . For purpose series intervention study evaluate optimal timing probiotic intervention optimal mode administration . Sections : Prenatal RCT 2 Randomized , parallel-design clinical trial 3 group . Pregnant woman ( n=256 ) family least one member allergic disease recruit maternal welfare clinic randomly assign control group one intervention group . Mothers dietary intervention group receive dietary counselling specific attention quality quantity fat diet . To promote achievement current dietary recommendation , mother provide food favourable fat composition ( e.g . spread ) . The subject intervention group randomize ( double-blind randomization ) receive either placebo probiotic preparation , 1010 cfu Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG Bifidobacterium lactis control receive placebo single-blind manner . Dietary food product probiotic supplementation continue 1st trimester pregnancy end exclusive breast feeding , maximum 6 month . Perinatal RCT 1 Randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled study 2 group . Pregnant woman ( n=159 ) randomize one study group 2-4 week term receive placebo ( microcrystalline cellulose ) probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( ATCC 53103 ; 1010 cfu ) . After delivery probiotics/ placebo administer orally infant 6 month . General information prevent allergy give write form : breast-feed least 4-6 month ; begin solid food 4-6 month ; smoke caretaker . RCT 3 Randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial 3 group . Pregnant woman ( n=241 ) history atopic disease assign one treatment group : receive 2 month delivery 2 month thereafter , breast-feeding , either placebo Lactobacillus rhamnosus Bifidobacterium longum Lactobacillus paracasei Bifidobacterium longum . Postnatal RCT 4 Randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled study 3 group . Neonates ( n=94 ) fulfil follow criterion : gestational age birth 32nd 36th week , weight 1500 g congenital defect gastrointestinal system defect prevent enteral nutrition , randomize receive either placebo ( microcrystalline cellulose ) probiotic preparation ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG , ATCC 53103 ) prebiotic preparation ( mixture Polydextrose Galacto-oligosaccharideOS 1:1 ratio ) . The treatment continue 2 month . RCT 5 Randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial 2 group . 2-6 week old formula- breast-fed colic infant ( n=30 ) , cry without medical cause 3h/d , 3days/week , randomize receive either placebo ( microcrystalline cellulose ) probiotic preparation ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG , ATCC 53103 ) 4 week . Formula-fed infant receive extensively hydrolyse formula mother breast-fed infant avoid cow 's milk diet .</detailed_description>
