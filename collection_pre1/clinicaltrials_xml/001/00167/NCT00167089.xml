	<detailed_description>Restoration independent ambulatory ability one common functional goal patient hemiplegia stroke . Ambulation training , therefore , important part physical therapy intervention patient . Conventional neurologic physical therapy ambulation training , base sorely neurophysiology , prohibit early ambulation experience stroke attempt avoid development abnormal gait pattern . Such approach show limited help patient regain independent ambulatory ability .</detailed_description>
