In contrast outpatient treatment malaria emergence resistance lead new drug policy , treatment hospitalise malaria case remain , many endemic country , intravenous quinine 7 day . The efficacy regimen well establish throughout Africa . The effectiveness quinine treatment may considerably low discontinuation treatment due early discharge , occurrence side effect fact patient feel well stop treatment . Therefore , sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) often add discharge . This regimen show effective . But Africa , practice seem widespread , assess two trial . Since resistance Plasmodium falciparum SP increase rapidly Africa evidence SP monotherapy induce gametocytaemia , hypothesize combination quinine/SP increase SP efficacy prevents induction gametocytaemia . In addition , since use full course quinine therapy may hamper many factor ( hospital cost , hospitalisation duration , availability bed , compliance side effect ) , addition long act SP complete short course quinine treatment may prevent recrudescence reinfection may increase effectiveness malaria treatment reduce postdischarge morbidity . The efficacy safety short course intravenous quinine ( 3-day treatment ) plus single dose oral SP treatment falciparum malaria investigate .</detailed_description>
