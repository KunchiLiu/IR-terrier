	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer commonly diagnose cancer among male U.S. More 220,000 men diagnose prostate cancer USA year 31,000 die disease . Androgen deprivation , elimination testosterone active metabolite , remain single effective intervention available treatment advance prostate carcinoma . Androgen deprivation induces immune response normal prostate prostate cancer , usually short-lived . Estradiol induce activation many arm immune system may effective long lasting mean induce immunity prostate tissue . This study treat clinically localized prostate cancer patient either estrogen , standard androgen deprivation without estrogen , prior prostatectomy order completely describe immune regulation estradiol men . Control tissue patient treat androgen deprivation procure Northwest Special Projects Oncology Research Excellence ( SPORE ) tissue core use comparison cancer treat prostatectomy . Tumors remove prostatectomy , tissue sample blood sample assess immune system change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Estrogens effective mean treat advanced prostate cancer . In randomized study estrogens good cancer control rate orchiectomy alone , suggest estrogen efficacy limited ability suppress testosterone . One hypothesis estrogens modulate immunity prostate cancer direct activation effector cell upregulating cytokine prostatic stroma . Administration estrogen murine model induce infiltration normal prostate T lymphocytes even castrate male animal potentially induction autoimmunity normally cryptic prostate antigen . Estrogens activate multiple immune effector autoimmunity broad variety experimental setting , suggest upregulation immune recognition many level . Pilot data demonstrate estrogen upregulate expression interferon regulate gene , major histocompatibility antigen ( MHC ) prostate cancer , increase number activation natural killer ( NK ) cell . Other group show standard form androgen deprivation also induce immunity normal malignant prostate tissue . We propose test hypothesis administration estrogen and/or androgen deprivation induces immune recognition prostate cancer human upregulation major histocompatibility antigens tumor induction tumor specific immunity . The specificity estrogen effect test compare measure immunity patient treat estradiol , androgen deprivation neoadjuvant therapy . Plan therapy The specific aim proposal : 1 . To treat patient clinically localize , low intermediate risk prostate cancer candidate radical prostatectomy either standard androgen deprivation prior surgery ( neoadjuvant androgen deprivation ) neoadjuvant transdermal estradiol . Patients undergo radical prostatectomy 21 day initiation treatment . 2 . To evaluate radical prostatectomy specimen obtain patient expression MHC class I II , NK ligands MICA MICB prostate carcinoma adjacent prostate immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) Western analysis . 3 . To evaluate tumor tissue infiltration clonal T lymphocyte , NK cell , plasmacytoid dendritic cell use IHC spectratyping T cell receptor gene rearrangement . 4 . To evaluate patient induction tumor specific antibody use patient immunoglobulin collect neoadjuvant therapy ( SEREX ) 5 . To evaluate patient induction NK cell upregulation NK receptor NKG2D patient lymphocytes androgen deprivation estradiol . 6 . To evaluate effect androgen deprivation estradiol induction plasma tissue level interferon gamma , alpha , beta , IL-4 GM-CSF ELISA ribonuclease protection assay .</detailed_description>
