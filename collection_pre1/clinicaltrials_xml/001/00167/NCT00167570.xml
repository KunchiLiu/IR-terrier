	<detailed_description>Successful rehabilitation majority low extremity amputee include prosthetic limb fit training . Critical success prosthetic fitting comfortable , well fit socket . Accomplishing remain clinical challenge residual limb pain socket discomfort affect 20-55 % low limb amputee . Achieving acceptable socket fit use conventional prosthetic technique require individual custom mold fabrication labor intensive , costly process . Alternative method fabricate prosthetic socket improve efficiency prosthetic provision , enhance comfort fit , reduce cost need ensure continue optimal rehabilitation amputee . This project continue development new promise method socket fabrication use solid freeform fabrication ( SFF ) base selective laser sintering ( SLS ) technology . SFF allow direct manufacture prosthetic socket without intermediate mold laminate process require conventional technique . The overall long-term goal project development clinically practical system rapid prosthetic limb provision integrate computer-aided design solid freeform fabrication technique . This proposal build previous successful demonstration feasibility SFF socket fabrication address several key issue underlie clinical viability . The specific objective propose work : 1 .
