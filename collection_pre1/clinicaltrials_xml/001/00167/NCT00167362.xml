	<brief_title>Cognitive Enhancement Therapy Early-Stage Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , wish determine neurobiological predictor relative efficacy Cognitive Enhancement Therapy ( CET ) ameliorate specific cognitive abnormality presumably mediate PFC related brain structure , among young , early-course schizophrenia patient potentially good prognosis . A series recent-onset schizophrenic patient , whose psychotic symptom successfully stabilized atypical antipsychotic drug one year follow initiation treatment , randomize CET combine enriched supportive therapy ( EST ) EST alone , treat two year . Subjects assess neurobehavioral clinical index immediately prior begin CET EST ( correspond CNMD 1-year follow-up ) propose study assess 1 2 year psychosocial treatment . In small subset patient , also seek collect preliminary data efficacy CET reverse neurobiological alteration PFC . The hypothesis study : 1 . The presence relatively well preserved PFC structure function ( PFC volume , activation fMRI , metabolism measure proton MRS ) baseline predict good response CET ( Neurobiological Prediction Hypothesis ) . 2 . CET combine `` enrich '' supportive psychotherapy ( EST ) effective EST alone ameliorate social non-social cognitive deficit patient early schizophrenic illness whose psychotic symptom stabilize maintenance chemotherapy ( The Treatment Efficacy Hypothesis ) . 3 . CET result additive , positive effect neurocognitive parameter observe follow one year antipsychotic medication , use `` sequential '' treatment design subset patient pre-neuroleptic baseline data CNMD study ( The Treatment Specificity Hypothesis ) . Study Design : Subjects randomly assign , stabilize clinically , CET plus EST ( n = 30 ) EST alone ( n = 30 ) treat two year . Clinical , neuropsychological , neurological functional neuroimaging assessment administer baseline two annual follow-up . At end CET EST treatment , subject ask come back quarterly meet informally either Cognitive Enhancement Therapy clinicians former group member , Enriched Supportive Therapy clinician . The purpose visit u learn success patient , difficulty might since leave program . Clinician ( ) also share information obtain follow-up might help patient overcome difficulty . At end one-year period post EST CET treatment , subject assess measure , except diagnostic , image blood study .</detailed_description>
