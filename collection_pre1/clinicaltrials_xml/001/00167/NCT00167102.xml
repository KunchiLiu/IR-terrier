	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine prospectively safety efficacy alefacept treatment subject severe alopecia areata scalp . Common feature psoriasis alopecia areata , include immunologic therapeutic aspect , suggest alefacept , show safe statistically significant beneficial therapeutic modality treatment psoriasis , may therapeutic value alopecia areata .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alefacept Patients With Severe Scalp Alopecia Areata</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alopecia areata ( AA ) autoimmune condition characterise T-cell mediate attack hair follicle . The incite antigenic stimulus unknown . A dense peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate reproducible immunologic abnormality hallmark feature condition . The cellular infiltrate primarily consist activated T-lymphocytes antigen-presenting Langerhans cell . T-lymphocytes play critical role pathogenesis disease . The observance hair regrowth alopecia areata treat cyclosporine , know inhibitor T-cell function , confirm central role T-lymphocytes development disease . Activation T-cells initiated interaction T-cell receptor antigen/major histocompatibility complex antigen-presenting cell . Co-stimulatory interaction occur secondarily , include bind T-cell CD2 receptor antigen-presenting cell ligand LFA-3 ( lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 CD58 ) . Induction molecular signal cascade resultant T-cell activation proliferation ensues . Abrogation activation may result diminished aborted expression disease , thus suggest potential therapeutic role alefacept treatment alopecia areata . Alefacept bioengineered LFA-3/Immunoglobulin fusion protein bind CD2 T-cell receptor interfere ligation LFA-3 . Binding immunoglobulin portion fusion protein FCy receptor antigen-presenting cell potentiate apoptosis CD-2 T-cells thereby reduce population activate T-cells . Psoriasis T-cell mediate disorder share many immunologic feature alopecia areata . Accordingly , treatment effective psoriasis often prove beneficial alopecia areata . Anthralin , topical intralesional steroid cyclosporine among several therapeutic agent efficacy disorder . Based impressive therapeutic response see psoriasis treat alefacept , similarly beneficial outcome tentatively anticipated treatment alopecia areata .</detailed_description>
