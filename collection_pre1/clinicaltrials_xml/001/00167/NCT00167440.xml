	<brief_summary>Each year United States 30,000 child admit intensive care unit . The majority child degree heart instability stay , yet currently routine way measure actual amount blood heart pump . The ability measure amount blood heart pump accurately easily frequent interval would helpful doctor care child many poor heart function result illness . Current technique use adult measure output heart either readily transfer child demand difficult invasive procedure . Because , amount blood heart pump measure enough frequency help guide care . Despite reality , accurate measurement amount blood heart pump patient crucial point illness would allow accurate use potentially harmful procedure could possibly improve outlook child . Likewise , able correctly measure blood volume could provide good way estimate pressure heart improve treatment . The purpose research study compare accuracy doctor estimate heart output , establish usefulness central blood volume measurement PCOM ( pediatric cardiac output measurement ) , less invasive procedure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Techniques Assessing Cardiac Output Preload Critically Ill Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability measure cardiac output accurately reproducibly frequent interval remain elusive clinician care critically ill pediatric patient although large proportion child know hemodynamic compromise result illness . I propose define accuracy clinician estimate cardiac output patient test ability new device measure central blood volume predict preload setting . I study 100 patient two group . The first group consist critically ill pediatric patient time admission PICU . These 50 patient cardiac output estimate three method : Estimation `` panel experience clinician '' ; Calculation arteriovenous content difference ; Direct measurement use new minimally invasive system base assess change ultrasound transmission blood intravenous administration small ( &lt; 5 ml ) bolus normal saline . Group two consist 50 PICU patient therapeutically require either fluid bolus ( 25 patient ) single intravenous dose diuretic ( 25 patient ) . These patient assess fashion outset , ongoing measurement cardiac output central blood volume use minimally invasive system central venous pressure use conventional technique 3 interval within first hour . Data analyze evaluate strength correlation expert assessment objective measure cardiac output patient ( linear regression calculation correlation coefficient ) . Group two patient divide accord therapeutic intervention . The strength correlation change central blood volume change central venous pressure cardiac output assess use similar statistical technique .</detailed_description>
