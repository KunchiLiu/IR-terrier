	<brief_summary>The purpose study replace mycophenolate mofetil ( Cellcept ) usual therapy liver transplantation sodium mycophenolic acid ( Myfortic® ) find effect change may development side effect relief gastrointestinal ( stomach ) problem . In past stop Cellcept ( current drug ) side effect . We also try see improved usage drug ( Myfortic® ) allow u use low dos medication low immune system . We special test blood see amount drug relate effect immune system side effect . Both Cellcept Myfortic® FDA approve medication although Myfortic® approve use liver transplantation . Myfortic® really active drug Cellcept® ( Mycophenolic acid ) coat prevent breakdown drug stomach make low know gastrointestinal effect Cellcept diarrhea , abdominal pain nausea .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enteric Coated Myfortic Liver Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mycophenolic Acid ( MPA ) show effective immune suppressant organ transplantation . Its gastrointestinal side effect , however , limited use liver transplantation ( OLT ) . A new form MPA enteric coat ( Myfortic ) develop address issue GI side effect . While considerable experience gain new formulation kidney transplant ( ref ) information regard use Myfortic OLT recipient limit . The purpose study assess safety efficacy Myfortic OLT recipient . The study include close follow-up patient regard side effect potential adverse effect drug . It also monitor rate compliance medication among patient study . The efficacy drug determine rate rejection also importantly ability withdraw corticosteroid minimize calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) . Several test conduct part study . Some `` Standard Care '' test liver function test complete blood cell count ( CBC ) . Some test however , perform specifically study . These include patient questionnaire fill various time point blood test design assess integrity immune system . The benefit patient three-fold : The patient receive medication free charge duration study . The proven efficacy MPA immune suppressant may allow u reduce eliminate use corticosteroid and/or CNI whose long short-term side effect major cause morbidity OLT recipient . Avoidance GI side effect non-enteric coated MPA , standard drug OLT . The risks patient include potential deleterious side effect MPA , namely bone marrow depression , GI side-effects ( nausea , diarrhea , abdominal pain ) , infection . The general benefit study may addition good formulation MPA list drug use immunosuppression OLT . Additionally , routine use drug may minimize long-term adverse effect CNI corticosteroid thus improve long-term patient survival well-being .</detailed_description>
