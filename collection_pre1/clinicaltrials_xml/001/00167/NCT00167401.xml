	<brief_summary>The University Rochester Cancer Center ( URCC ) conduct research study Highland Hospital Strong Memorial lung cancer patient whose tumor surgically remove . The usual treatment stage cancer chemotherapy ( treatment drug ) combine radiation ( chemo-radiation ) . Because risk spread organ , patient stage disease also often treated additional chemotherapy , either chemo-radiation treatment . The best timing number treatment additional chemotherapy clearly establish . The purpose study help determine single treatment two chemotherapy drug , follow radiation low-dose chemotherapy effective way treat patient lung cancer . The side effect treatment quality life study also study . Eighteen participate study locally .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer . Clinical pathologic stage IIIA ( T13N2M0 , T3N1M0 ) IIIB ( Any T N3M0 , T4 Any N M0 ) diseases accord American Joint Committee Cancer criterion ( Appendix I ) . Patients malignant pleural effusion exclude . The primary tumor must radiographically measurable bidimensionally measurable disease Age &gt; 18 . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 ( Appendix II ) . FEV1 sufficient patient tolerate radiation therapy , discretion radiation oncologist , usually &gt; 800 ml , may higher low depend volume radiotherapy portal , variable tumor extent . WBC &gt; 3000 ; platelet count &gt; 100,000 ; absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000 ; hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ; serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min . Laboratory value must obtain &lt; 3 week prior registration . Patients equivocal enlargement adrenal gland ( ) CT scan , equivocal regional distant lesion image study need image study biopsy rule distant metastasis . Transaminases ( SGOT and/or SGPT ) may 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) alkaline phosphatase &lt; ULN , alkaline phosphatase may 4 x ULN transaminases &lt; ULN . However , patient transaminase elevation &gt; 1.5 x ULN alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN eligible study ( due decrease clearance docetaxel increase risk toxicity ) . Preexisting neuropathy must grade I less . A sign informed consent . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test . Men woman childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception treatment reasonable period thereafter . Patients distant metastasis ( stage IV disease ) . Patients without measurable disease . Patients medical contraindication chemotherapy radiotherapy . Patients myocardial infarction within precede six month symptomatic heart disease , include angina , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled arrhythmia . Patients bilirubin elevate institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) must exclude . Women pregnant breast feeding eligible . Patients history severe hypersensitivity reaction Taxotere® drug formulate polysorbate 80 must exclude .</criteria>
