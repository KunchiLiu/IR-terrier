	<detailed_description>As life expectancy old Americans increase , prevention age-associated physical function decline disability emerge major clinical public health priority . A critical factor old person 's ability function independently mobility , ability move without assistance . Older people lose mobility less likely remain community , high rate morbidity , mortality , hospitalization experience poor quality life . While several study suggest physical activity may prevent physical disability , include mobility disability healthy frail older adult , definitive evidence lacking . A Phase 3 , randomize , control trial need fill evidence gap . Currently data estimate sample size need trial insufficient feasibility data gather trial effectively design implement . To refine key trial design benchmark ( include sample size calculation demonstrate feasibility full-scale trial refining/developing recruitment , procedure , material organizational infrastructure ) , LIFE ( Lifestyle Interventions Independence Elders ) study conduct pilot , single-blind , randomize , control trial involve comparison physical activity program moderate intensity successful age program . Approximately 400 sedentary person age 70 &lt; 90 year risk disability follow least one year four intervention site : Wake Forest University School Medicine Winston Salem , NC ; University Pittsburgh Pittsburgh , PA ; Cooper Institute Dallas , TX ; Stanford University Palo Alto , CA . The Administrative Coordinating Center Data Management Quality Control Center Wake Forest University School Medicine . The LIFE study ass combine outcome major mobility disability , define incapacity walk 400 meter ( ) , death , primary outcome full-scale study . This outcome use previous randomize , control trial , therefore , pilot study need assess incidence rate . Secondary outcome include ADL disability , major fall injury cardiovascular event . LIFE explore effect intervention physical performance measure , cognitive function , health-related quality life , use health care service . In addition , LIFE explore performs cost-effectiveness analysis intervention . This pilot study yield necessary preliminary data design definitive Phase 3 , randomize , control trial . By provide conclusive answer regard whether physical activity effective preventing major mobility disability death , result full-scale trial relevant clinical public health implication , fill important gap knowledge practice evidence-based geriatric medicine .</detailed_description>
