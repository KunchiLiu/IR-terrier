	<brief_summary>Expected Enrollment : 40 patient Study Start Date : June 2005 Study Objectives : - To conduct pilot study ass safety , tolerability , antiviral activity Kaletra 400/100 mg take twice day ( bid ) antiretroviral ( ARV ) -naïve HIV-infected patient Week 48 Primary Objectives : - To determine proportion patient HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL week 24 48 - To determine proportion patient HIV RNA &lt; 50 week 24 48 - To elucidate specific adverse event ( AE ) profile Kaletra single agent therapy Secondary Objectives : - To assess proportion patient limit quantification ( LOQ ) visit . Patients observed baseline , week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 48 . - To determine time HIV RNA reach &lt; 400 &lt; 50 copies/mL - To determine time virologic failure - To assess change baseline visit HIV RNA CD4 count week 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 48 . - To assess change genotype baseline time confirm virologic failure ( 2 consecutive HIV RNA measurement &gt; 400 copies/mL suppress &lt; 400 copies/mL ) time treatment intensification . - To characterize change lipid triglyceride concentration time effect treatment appropriate drug ( fibrate statin , necessary ) elevation . - To evaluate safety tolerability subject 48 week drug exposure . - To describe virologic response follow intensification Kaletra single agent virologic failure</brief_summary>

Should patient decide become sexually active course study , must counsel willing use one birth control method list : *Double barrier method ( male condom/spermicide , male condom/diaphragm , diaphragm/spermicide ) ; *Any intrauterine device ( IUD ) publish data show expected failure rate &lt; 1 % per year ( IUDs meet criterion ) ; *Sterilization ( female patient male partner female patient ) ; *Any method publish data show low expected failure rate method &lt; 1 % per year . NOTE : Data insufficient exclude clinically important interaction LPV/r drug , hormonal contraceptive , highly metabolize cytochrome P450 enzyme system . As result , hormonal contraception consider adequate . Patient active AIDSdefining opportunistic infection disease accord 1993 CDC AIDS surveillance definition ( Clinical Category C ) , opinion investigator , would preclude patient participate study .

Patient either pregnant time screen evaluation breastfeeding . Patient , opinion investigator , unlikely able complete 48week dose period protocol evaluation assessment adhere study drug regimen . Patient suffers serious medical condition , diabetes , congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy cardiac dysfunction , opinion investigator would compromise safety patient Patient malabsorption syndrome gastrointestinal dysfunction , may interfere drug absorption render patient unable take oral medication . Patient undergo interferon therapy HCV anticipate undergoing therapy course trial HBV coinfection Patient follow laboratory result within 30 day prior first dose study medication : *Hemoglobin concentration &lt; 8.0 g/dL ; *Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 750 cells/mm3 ; *Platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/ mm3 ; *Aminotransferase ( AST , ALT ) &gt; 3 time ULN ; *Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 time Upper Limits Normal ( ULN ) Patient require treatment radiation therapy cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent within 4 week prior entry , anticipate need agent within study period . Patient require treatment immunomodulating agent , systemic corticosteroid , interleukin , interferon ’ within 4 week prior study entry , patient receive HIV immunotherapeutic vaccine within 3 month prior entry . Asthmatic patient use inhaled corticosteroid eligible enrollment . Patient receive methadone therapy Patients require foscarnet therapy therapy agent document activity HIV1 vitro .
