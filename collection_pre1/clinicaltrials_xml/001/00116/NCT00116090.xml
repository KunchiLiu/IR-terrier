	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether therapy suppresses immune system give treat inflammatory disease eye associate great risk death cancer . Inflammatory diseases eye , include uveitis , scleritis , mucous membrane pemphigoid , major blinding disease . For patient , treatment corticosteroid enough control disease . Researchers expect gain information whether immunosuppressive therapy suitable patient substance avoid . Also , study evaluate frequency short-term complication immunosuppressive therapy well benefit therapy bring treatment eye disease . The medical chart patient age 65 ( median age range 21 65 ) inflammatory , noninfectious eye disease may examine study . A database construct chart review patient see uveitis clinic National Eye Institute since 1977 three site . Patients consider exposed immunosuppressive therapy compare two group : general U.S. population internal group patient inflammatory eye disease receive immunosuppression . Data regard 10,000 15,000 patient collect . Patients identified chart review . The incidence cancer examine well outcomes immosuppressive therapy measure control eye disease , visual sharpness , change use corticosteroid , rate remission-when disease symptom lessen . Also examine medical chart control group patient receive immunosuppressive therapy uveitis . Data cancer incidence would difficult obtain , require personal contact patient . In situation , patient contact phone mail , provide informed consent ask medical history , include previous occurrence cancer condition . For patient die , researcher attempt communicate next kin regard medical information .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy Eye Diseases ( SITE ) Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Ocular inflammatory disease , include uveitis , scleritis , mucous membrane pemphigoid , major blind eye disease . For patient , corticosteroid therapy insufficient control ocular inflammatory disease , immunosuppressive therapy require . Immunosuppressive therapy eye diseases commonly employ antimetabolite , T-cell inhibitor , and/or alkylating agent therapy . It suggest , base study patient severe systemic immunologic systemic disease , treatment may result increase risk cancer long-term morbidity . In study , difficult determine whether excess risk arise underlying systemic disease treatment . AIMS : The Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy Eye Diseases ( SITE ) Cohort Study evaluate directly whether immunosuppressive therapy ocular inflammatory disease associate excess risk mortality cancer . The study expect generate critical information decide whether immunosuppressive therapy warrant patient , whether certain immunosuppressive agent avoid . In addition , study evaluate frequency short-term complication therapy , ocular benefit therapy . METHODS : The SITE Study classic retrospective cohort design . A database construct chart review patient see Uveitis clinic NEI since 1977 3 site . Patients expose immunosuppressive therapy compare two group : 1 ) external standard , general United States population ; 2 ) internal comparison group , patient ocular inflammatory disease receive immunosuppression . Approximately 10000-15000 patient accrue four center pioneer use immunosuppressive therapy eye disease , begin 19-29 year ago . Patients receive immunosuppressive therapy eye disease , patient ocular inflammatory diagnosis , identify chart review . Those subsequently die identify search National Death Index and/or Social Security Death Index . In addition overall mortality , cause-specific mortality evaluate , obtain death certificate coding . The data collect NIH compare National Death Index separately data center , via direct query center . Abstracted data without identifier study number letter code could use identify subject anyone outside LI send central database . The outcomes mortality , cause-specific mortality , cancer incidence analyze use relative incidence approach . Description short-term complication immunosuppression beneficial effect immunosuppression eye disease also evaluate . This study 's chair John Kempen Wilmer Eye Institute Johns Hopkins School Medicine . We participate center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients follow diagnosis include : Anterior uveitis ; Intermediate uveitis ; Posterior uveitis panuveitis ; Scleritis ; Mucous membrane pemphigoid ; Other noninfectious ocular inflammatory disease . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : No ocular inflammatory disease ; Infectious ocular inflammatory disease ( e.g . toxoplasmic retinitis , endophthalmitis , viral retinitis ) , unless infectious uveitis follow treatment noninfectious ocular inflammatory disease .</criteria>
