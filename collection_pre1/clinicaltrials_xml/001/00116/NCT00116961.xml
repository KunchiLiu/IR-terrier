	<brief_summary>This research study patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma . Multiple myeloma remain non-curable disease however , new medication combination appear provide high response rate higher complete response rate current treatment option . One new medication multiple myeloma Velcade . Preliminary result study use combination Velcade Doxil show high response rate ( disease reduction ) . Preliminary result also show addition dexamethasone Velcade patient respond Velcade alone show improved response rate . This study involve treatment new combination three standard medication : Velcade , Doxil , dexamethasone ( VDd combination ) . The propose combination three drug may improve efficacy response . Velcade approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment multiple myeloma patient receive least two prior therapy demonstrate disease progression last therapy . Velcade still currently investigation indication . Doxil approve use multiple myeloma approve drug use patient cancer . Several publish clinical trial provide evidence Doxil active agent multiple myeloma use treatment combination multiple myeloma general practice . Dexamethasone standard therapy multiple myeloma , approve FDA use . The combination three drug experimental ( FDA approve ) . The goal study determine new combination therapy Velcade , Doxil dexamethasone effective treatment also determine side effect occur combination treatment give .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Velcade , Doxil , Dexamethasone ( VDd ) First Line Therapy Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma remain non-curable disease . Initial therapy one commonly use regimen , thalidomide dexamethasone , VAD , dexamethasone pulse , melphalan prednisone result least partial response ( PR ) approximately 50-75 % patient . Complete response ( CRs ) regimens uncommon . A proportion patient improvement response autologous stem cell transplant , usually follow initial therapy . However , virtually patient eventually relapse require re-treatment . Emerging data suggest achieve CR near CR transplantation result durable remission longer survival . It clear whether CR response initial therapy prior transplant may similar impact overall outcome . Newer agent combination appear provide high response rate higher CR rate . One new active agent multiple myeloma Velcade ( bortezomib , formerly know PS-341 ) . This molecule novel mechanism action specifically inhibiting proteasome . In reported phase II trial , Velcade single agent induce least minimal response ( MR ) 35 % patient CR 4 % patient , least stabilization disease 59 % patient heavily pretreated , relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma use strict SWOG criterion . Velcade alone superior dexamethasone pulse phase III randomize study patient least one 3 line therapy . Preliminary report indicate combination Velcade active anti-myeloma agent appear provide superior outcome Velcade alone . An additional 18 % patient respond dexamethasone combine Velcade patient population refractory Velcade alone . Velcade Doxil show produce high response rate phase I study 60 % PR rate 20 % CR rate acceptable toxicity patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . There limited data outcome treatment newly diagnose patient myeloma Velcade combination . Velcade single agent show impressive response rate newly diagnose patient 55 % percent patient achieve least PR 77 % patient achieve least MR per preliminary report phase II study . Treatment Velcade appear affect stem cell collection . Considering high activity Velcade alone untreated patient superior activity combination Velcade either Doxil dexamethasone , propose combine three agent VDd combination ( i.e . Velcade , Doxil , dexamethasone ) . We hypothesize combination similar well efficacy compare commonly use combination initial therapy ( i.e . thalidomide dexamethasone , dexamethasone pulse , VAD melphalan prednisone ) Velcade alone high treatment regimen CR rate acceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
