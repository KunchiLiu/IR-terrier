	<detailed_description>Introduction One great challenge plan vector control program develop Countries provision cover population remote isolated area . Commonly , community bear great burden disease due location inaccessibility local health care . Yunnan Province good example problem . The border region Laos , Myanmar Vietnam contribute high proportion malaria case whole China , yet disease control initiatives cover rural minority people migrant worker inhabit region . Comprehensive ethnobotanical survey area show many 25 minority people live isolated community already use traditional herbal form mosquito control utilising several abundant specie particularly diverse local environment . Having identify number potentially useful plant specie use , term availability , sustainability , low cost ( free ) know chemical constituent , investigator local Chinese malaria control official consider phase II evaluation promise candidate justify . In particular , 4 widely use plant traditionally use fumigant reduce / prevent mosquito enter house , either burn dry fresh material indoor cooking fire even , spray tincture around entry site like eaves &amp; window . Due method use , would difficult simulate laboratory , simple mean field evaluation chosen . Materials The ethnobotanical survey reveal follow plant specie candidate study ; Artemesia argyi , Eucalyptus robusta , Eupatorium odoratum , Cinnamomum glanduliferum Each plant species occur naturally abundance region collection significant environmental impact . Moderate amount ( approx 1 Kg ) sufficient study collect locally field site prior ( use dry ) start experiment ( fresh ) . Methods Plants evaluate natural user condition randomise controlled manner village Xishuangbanna Region , Yunnan , PR China . Village- base study several mosquito control method already successfully undertaken region LSHTM YIPD team . Villages belong one ethnic group use traditional method select accord agreement local health worker YIPD village elder , availability plant specie , preliminary survey vector specie collect indoors CDC trap . A different village select plant evaluate . After collect background entomological data , 6 house match baseline parameter ( occupancy level , location , construction &amp; animal proximity ) evenly space among others village ( reduce diversion effect ) enrol study . On one night , 2 allocate treatment ( use plant ) , 2 allocate hay ( use cattle bed ) negative control , 2 leave unused ( reduce residual effect ) . In case treatment control group instruct place pre-prepared batch plant material ( weighed fresh dry depend upon type ) onto cook fire traditional manner early evening . Commercial CDC trap ( BioQuip Inc. , USA ) use / beside sleep area house 1 hour sunset early morning . Catches identify local vector expert day record species number . House treatment rotate night use latin square principle achieve minimum 12 replicates treatment every house ( 36 night duration , 216 trap/nights ) , take place rainy ( malaria ) season ( July - Nov 2005 ) plant vector level high . In case C. glanduliferum , plant extract ( hay extract ) spray predetermine rate onto eaves &amp; door / windows traditional manner follow principle . Efficacy determine compare mosquito specie / number catch control &amp; treatment house use appropriate statistical analysis &amp; ANOVA methodology .</detailed_description>
