	<brief_title>MARS - Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two conceptual advance occur 1980 's make possible test hypothesis significant alteration serum lipoproteins substantially reduce atherosclerosis progression even induce regression . The first advance development arteriogram use characterize atherosclerosis , greatly reduce number patient required evaluation intervention design prevent coronary atherosclerosis progression . The second advance development lovastatin provide lipid-lowering alternative much easy tolerate niacin/colestipol combination previously use , show comparably effective LDL reduction patient family history high cholesterol . A total 270 high-risk coronary artery disease patient , eligible coronary artery bypass surgery , recruit study . All patient receive angiograms randomly assign either lovastatin placebo group stratify three baseline factor : sex , smoke status , plasma cholesterol level . Patients initially receive lovastatin 40mg twice day matching placebo . Those patient receive lovastatin whose total plasma cholesterol level le 110mg/dL one visit 120 mg/dL two successive visit dosage halve , maintain optimal dosage remainder study . Coronary angiography perform prior screen month 24 ( visit 18 ) . Angiographic assessment femoral artery also perform baseline month 24 . Noninvasive ultrasound image carotid artery ( include carotid intima-media thickness ) perform every 6 month . Patients report clinic monthly 12 month , two-month interval thereafter . Plasma lipid , routine laboratory safety physical examination also perform .</detailed_description>
