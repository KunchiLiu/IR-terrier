	<brief_summary>This study seek increase understand dopamine receptor function brain major depressive disorder bipolar depression , well genetic change may behind change receptor ' action . Dopamine natural messenger brain , involved reward , motivation , mood . Volunteers age 18 55 primary major depressive disorder bipolar depression ( 20 group ) , HIV positive AIDS , pregnant breastfeeding may eligible study . A telephone interview hold , patient answer standardized question psychiatric medical symptom may experience lifetime . Those eligible study undergo interview laboratory test . A psychiatric interview clinical assessment collect various data . Patients undergo following procedure test : - A brief neurological examination - A one-minute electrocardiogram measure electrical activity heart . - Laboratory test measure several substance blood urine . - Pregnancy test . A magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan do create image volunteer 's brain structure . The technique MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . During MRI scan , volunteer lie still table slide scanner 30 minute case 90 minute . Volunteers ask lie still possible procedure . Then PET system create two image brain blood flow-one brain dopamine 1 receptor one dopamine 2/3 receptor binding . Volunteers give radiotracer , tiny amount drug detect special camera PET scanner . A tiny flexible tube place vein one arm PET scan MRI scan . Volunteers ask lie still PET scanner table . A mask large hole eye , ear , mouth place head , keep head move . After radiotracer injection give , PET scanner create brain image . There may two PET scan session , require 3 hour scan . During one break . At end scan session , volunteer ask drink several glass water urinate immediately , reduce radiation exposure bladder wall . Genetic screen help enhance researcher ' understanding role dopamine receptor depression . A small blood sample , 2 tablespoon , collect , isolate DNA blood cell . Some blood sample DNA may store future study , sample remain coded , participant identify . This study direct benefit participant . However , result may provide knowledge help people future . This study involve compensation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The dopaminergic projection substantia nigra ventral tegmental area ventral striatum medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) play major role neural process underlie motivate behavior . Hypofunction system hypothesize underlie anhedonia , psychomotor slow amotivation characterize major depressive disorder ( MDD ; ( Fibiger , 1991 ; Swerdlow Koob , 1987 ) . A variety indirect evidence support hypothesis ( Wilner , 1995 ) : 1 ) Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) concentration DA metabolite , homovanillic acid , reduce nondelusional , depressive . 2 ) Dextroamphetamine ( AMPH ) improve mood depressed patient , direct DA receptor agonist ( e.g . pramapaxil ) DA reuptake inhibitor ( e.g . nomiphensine ) exert antidepressant effect . 3 ) Many somatic antidepressant therapy enhance D ( 2/3 ) receptor sensitivity limbic structure and/or increase interstitial DA concentration mPFC accumbens rat . 4 ) Conditions DA deplete increase risk develop major depression , DA receptor antagonist administration produce dysphoria , avolition fatigue healthy human . In direct assessment DA receptor pharmacology , Suhara et al . ( 1992 ) report abnormal decrease D1 receptor bind use [ ( 11 ) C ] SCH 23390 frontal cortex bipolar subject . However , [ ( 11 ) C ] SCH 23390 affinity 5-HT ( 2 ) receptor frontal cortex ( De Keyser et al.,1988 ) specificity result remain unclear . In contrast , [ ( 11 ) C ] NNC 112 selective D1 receptor show sufficient receptor selectivity access D ( 1 ) receptor bind frontal cortex mood disorder . Previous study D ( 2 ) receptor use [ ( 11 ) C ] raclopride , [ 11C ] NMSP [ ( 123 ) I ] IBZM limit lack sensitivity radioligands receptor outside striatum . Striatal D ( 2 ) receptor bind report abnormally increase psychotic bipolar subject relative control non-psychotic bipolar subject use [ ( 11 ) C ] NMSP ( Pearlson et al. , 1995 ) unaltered subject Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) compare control two study use [ ( 123 ) I ] IBZM ( Klimke et al. , 1999 ; Parsey et al. , 2001 ) . An increased basal ganglia-to-cerebellum ratio D ( 2 ) receptor bind use [ ( 123 ) I ] IBZM report depressed MDD subject compare control ( D'Hanenen Bossuyt , 1994 ; Ebert et al. , 1996 ) . SPECT image study show [ ( 123 ) I ] IBZM bind striatal D ( 2/3 ) receptor abnormally elevate MDD . Although study confound medication effect small subject sample , [ ( 123 ) I ] IBZM bind sensitive competition endogenous DA , abnormality could reflect reduce intrasynaptic DA level striatum MDD subject . The current study address limitation previous study characterize D1 D2 receptor bind depression extrastriatal , well striatal region . PET measure [ 11C ] NNC 112 [ ( 18 ) F ] fallypride bind ass D ( 1 ) D ( 2/3 ) receptor bind potential ( BP ) , respectively , unmedicated depressed subject ( part A ) . The 11C-Raclopride Bolus plus constant infusion ( B/I ) PET scan ass D ( 2 ) receptor bind vivo striatum subject perform monetary reward task , specifically design induce change striatal dopaminergic transmission ( part B ) . The application high resolution 3D PET MRI-based region-of-interest analysis permit specific assessment abnormality D ( 2/3 ) receptor system currently depress individual MDD BD correlation clinical rating ventral dorsal striatum well extrastriatal area amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex , medial prefrontal cortex orbital cortex . Possible relationship polymorphisms gene cod element dopaminergic system well dopamine receptor study MDD BD level binding detect investigated collect preliminary data . SPECIFIC AIMS 1 . Assess D ( 1 ) receptor bind BD subject performance work memory attention base task . Hypothesis 1a . D ( 1 ) receptor bind decreased frontal cortex unaltered striatum BD subject compare healthy control . Hypothesis 1b . Working memory attention task performance impairment correlate change bind level . 2 . Evaluate striatal extrastriatal D ( 2/3 ) receptor binding , severity depression , psychomotor retardation anhedonia depress subject BD MDD compare healthy control . Hypothesis 2a . Baseline [ ( 18 ) F ] fallypride bind ventral striatum , amygdala , medial thalamus , orbital cortex subgenual PFC increase depressive relative control . Hypothesis 2b . The ventral striatal D ( 2/3 ) receptor bind correlate positively rating anhedonia depressed mood , negatively psychomotor performance speed . Hypothesis 2c . Baseline [ ( 11 ) C ] raclopride bind ventral striatum increase depressed patient increase correlate negatively subjective evaluation reward stimuli mood . Hypothesis 2d . The monetary reward task induce reduction [ ( 11 ) C ] raclopride striatal binding , large control depress patient correlate negatively anhedonia score . Secondary Aims : A . To explore difference D ( 1 ) D ( 2/3 ) receptor bind MDD BD subject . B . To investigate whether polymorphisms D ( 1 ) D ( 2/3 ) receptor gene may associate difference receptor BP . C. To assess relationship [ 11C ] NNC bind D ( 1 ) receptor performance work memory attention base task CANTAB ( Cambridge Cognition , UK ) , include Rapid Visual Information Processing test ( RVIP ) Spatial Working Memory test ( SWM ) Pattern Recognition Memory test ( PRM ) .</detailed_description>
