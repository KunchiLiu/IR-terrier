	<brief_summary>Despite recent advance , patient advance colorectal cancer continue poor prognosis . 5-FU , leucovorin , oxaliplatin bevacizumab standard treatment option patient stage IV colorectal cancer . Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , leucovorin oxaliplatin consider traditional chemotherapy try stop tumor growth affect divide . Bevacizumab therapy try block blood vessel tumor need grow . It consider 'targeted agent ' . Erlotinib another targeted agent , show effective treating lung cancer . This trial assess potential benefit add second target agent standard treatment .</brief_summary>
