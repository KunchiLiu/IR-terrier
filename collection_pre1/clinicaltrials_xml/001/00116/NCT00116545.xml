	<brief_title>TART - Troglitazone Atherosclerosis Regression Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance hyperinsulinism appear important risk factor development atherosclerosis diabetes patient . The atherogenic potential insulin show improve cholesterol may effect thickness structure arterial wall . Troglitazone oral diabetic agent treat insulin resistance . Based initial data available , would appear troglitazone may effective glycemic control improved atherosclerosis risk diabetes patient . This study compare effect troglitazone placebo insulin-requiring diabetes patient glycemic control progression atherosclerosis . A total 288 men woman 30 70 year age insulin-treated diabetes recruit enter 8 week run-in phase stabilize diet , exercise , insulin dose glucose level . Upon successful completion run-in phase , patient randomize one two group receive either troglitazone 400mg/day match placebo continue diet exercise regimens insulin dose maintain pre-meal glucose level 100 150 mg/dL . Follow visit occur every 2 week 2 month , every 4 week 2 month , every 8 week remainder 2-year trial . The progression atherosclerosis measure ultrasonography baseline every 6 month throughout 2 year randomize treatment .</detailed_description>
