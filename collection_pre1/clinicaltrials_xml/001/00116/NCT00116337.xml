	<brief_title>Spinal Cord Stimulation Restore Cough</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cervical thoracic spinal cord injury often paralysis major portion expiratory muscle — muscle responsible cough — therefore , lack normal cough mechanism . Consequently , patient suffer markedly reduce ability clear airway secretion , factor contributes development recurrent respiratory tract infection pneumonia bronchitis . Expiratory muscle activate electrical stimulation spinal root produce functionally effective cough . The purpose trial determine electrical stimulation expiratory muscle capable produce effective cough demand . According trial researcher , successful , technique prevent need frequent patient suction — often require constant presence train personnel . It also allow spinal cord injure patient clear secretion readily , thereby reduce incidence respiratory complication associate illness death . In trial , researcher study 18 adult ( 18-70 year old ) spinal injury ( T5 level high ) , least 12 month follow date injury . After evaluation medical history , brief physical examination , initial testing , participant small electrode ( metal disc ) place — routine surgical procedure — surface spinal cord low back stimulate expiratory muscle restore cough .</detailed_description>
