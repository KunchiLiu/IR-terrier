	<brief_summary>In type 2 diabetic patient poor glycemic control despite maximum `` classic '' oral treatment , bed time insulin therapy may lead parallel increase abdominal visceral subcutaneous fat , whereas pioglitazone treatment lead stability ( even decrease ) visceral increase subcutaneous abdominal fat . As visceral fat mass correlate insulin-resistance cardio-vascular risk , evolution visceral abdominal fat type 2 diabetic patient great importance . Main objective : To compare visceral subcutaneous abdominal fat compartment six-month bed time insulin pioglitazone treatment type 2 diabetic patient poor glycemic control despite maximal oral treatment metformin sulfonylurea . The study hypothesis quantity visceral subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue differently evolute compare 6 month treatment pioglitazone® ( 30 45mg/j ) NPH `` bed-time `` insulin ( 0.2u/kg/</brief_summary>
