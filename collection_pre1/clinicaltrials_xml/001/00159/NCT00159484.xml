	<brief_summary>This study people advance colorectal cancer . This study use drug Celebrex EPO906 . EPO906 experimental drug approve FDA . EPO906 drug show laboratory cause cancer cell die prevents grow reproduce . Celebrex drug approve FDA treatment arthritis prevention colon polyp . Colon polyp small growth colon . If surgically remove , colon polyp become cancerous . Some study show Celebrex may reduce side effect chemotherapy . Other study show may increase effectiveness chemotherapy . Celebrex approve FDA reduce side effect chemotherapy improve effectiveness chemotherapy . The combination EPO906 Celebrex study experimental . The main goal study see add drug Celebrex drug EPO906 decrease amount diarrhea see patient receive EPO906 . The goal first phase study find high dose EPO906 give safely Celebrex . The dose Celebrex remain whole study . Higher dose EPO906 give group patient . The increase EPO906 stop one patient serious side effect . The high dose EPO906 give Celebrex ( without serious side effect ) call pilot dose . The goal second phase study find tumor respond dos drug . Another purpose study see body process EPO906 Celebrex . This study also look side effect drug . In study , measure long subject live , often tumor shrink receive study drug , long take tumor increase size receive study drug . This study also measure level gene , cell 's blueprint , participant 's tumor . Several gene affect people 's body react cancer drug . Genes also measure participant 's blood . We want see predict response study drug .</brief_summary>
