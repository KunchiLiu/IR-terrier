	<detailed_description>Introduction : Total hip replacement surgery standard procedure , show cost-effective give patient pain free daily living . Since Sir Charnley make total hip replacement standard procedure million hip implant . In Denmark 100 100.000 get hip replacement operation 2001 ( DHAR ) . When patient painful hip due arthrosis , arthritis , fracture sequela reason , offer total hip replacement , several issue take consideration : concurrent disease , bone quality , age , life expectancy , prosthesis type , operation method etc . In elderly patient thorough medical evaluation perform order minimise intraoperative risc cardiopulmonary morbidity . Nearly patient Denmark ( 99 % ) get thromboprophylaxis hospital stay minimise cardiovascular complication . After surgery patient visit outpatient clinic routine control 3 12 month . After time patient usually orthopedic control . Evaluations procedures Scandinavian country collect database . These database construct national collection data sheet hospital performing procedure . The collected data often include data far arthroplasty concern . Normally monitoring quality collect data – considerable margin error result produce database must expect . The amount publication concern total joint replacement enormous , publication field come clinical trial deal new pharmacological product new implant . Very authors consider overall patient morbidity quality life hip replacement operation . Therefore Ph.D. project plan get new data population offer total hip replacement . Furthermore , attempt find prognostic factor far overall risk cardiopulmonary complication first 1 – 3 year operation . Purpose : The purpose study : Create database include description patient population undergo total hip replacement special emphasis orthopedic cardiovascular complication quality life 1 year postoperatively . Characterise patient risk mention event Create method predict patient risk short-term ( 90 day ) long term ( 1 year ) complication relation hip replacement surgery . Hypothesis : It well define small group high risk patient get serious cardiovascular complication . The risk cardiovascular complication increase long period postoperative hospital stay . A neglectable group patient get expect benefit operation . Methods : A prospective monocentre , longitudinal cohort study 500 patient operated County Frederiksborg 01.01 2004 . The data collect interview operation , day 5 3 month year . And additional data collect patient file , local hip- anaesthesia database , laboratory system , Danish Hospital Discharge Register ( LPR ) , autopsy report death register . Statistical method : In PhD study include various course , include course statistical method . External statistical aid might necessary . Patients : Inclusion criterion : All patient operate total hip replacement Frederiksborg amt 01.01.2004 500 pt . include . Exclusion criterion : Refuse consent age 18years . Ethical Considerations : Local Scientific Ethical Committee theDanish Dataprotection Agency approve project . The project follow Guidelines Good Clinical Practise . The investigation imply discomfort risk patient .</detailed_description>
