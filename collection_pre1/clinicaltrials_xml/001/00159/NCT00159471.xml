	<brief_summary>This study patient advance pancreatic cancer , use drug gemcitabine , docetaxel capecitabine . Gemcitabine drug approve FDA . Gemcitabine approve treatment cancer pancreas . It also approve treatment lung cancer combination another drug call cisplatin . Docetaxel drug approve FDA . Docetaxel approve treatment breast lung cancer . Capecitabine drug approve FDA treatment cancer colon rectum . This study measure level certain substance participant 's tumor . These substance ( call gene , cell 's blueprint substance ) affect people 's body react cancer drug . Genes also measure participant 's blood . The purpose study see substance predict survival response patient receive study drug . In study wish find long take patient ' cancer worsen , long survive receiving study drug . The side effect combination gemcitabine , docetaxel capecitabine also evaluate .</brief_summary>
