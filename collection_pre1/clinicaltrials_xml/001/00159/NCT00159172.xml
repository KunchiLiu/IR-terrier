	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Motor Cortex Stimulation Treatment Advanced Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced stage Parkinson disease ( PD ) difficult condition treat , especially several year dopaminergic drug . Recent development neurosurgical technique use deep brain stimulation lead show good behavioral result advance PD patient . However , placement stimulation lead subthalamic nucleus complex , invasive , long surgical procedure . Such intervention require sophisticated technical environment , include stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) exam , associate per-operative electrophysiological exploration deep brain structure . This surgical treatment therefore indicate selected patient , offer large proportion patient among potential candidate ( estimation 5000 patient France ) . Thus , need develop therapeutic alternative would technically practically convenient , less invasive , could offer large number patient . Several clinical study , include one lead group , already demonstrate transcranial magnetic cortical stimulation could improve bradykinesia shorten motor reaction time patient Parkinson disease . The clinical benefit however moderate , transient , probably stimulate session short duration . A prolonged effect could obtain continuous cortical stimulation . Such cortical stimulation already develop good clinical tolerance hospital since 1991 chronic neuropathic pain syndrome . In non-human primate model late stage Parkinson disease , recently demonstrate prolonged primary motor cortex stimulation significantly improve akinesia bradykinesia . The primary objective pilot study evaluate tolerance efficacy chronic stimulation primary motor cortex 10 patient suffer advanced stage Parkinson disease , despite optimisation dopaminergic treatment . The expected benefit patient gait improvement , increase movement velocity , finally good quality life associate reduction dopaminergic medication low per-operative morbidity risk .</detailed_description>
