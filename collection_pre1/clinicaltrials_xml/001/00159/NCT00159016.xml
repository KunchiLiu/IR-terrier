	<brief_summary>This phase II , multi-center ( Israeli ) , open label , non-randomized trial every patient specify tumor express c-kit PDGFR . Expression kinase investigate tumor sample obtain time diagnosis time recurrent disease . Every patient positive expression either kinase evaluate quantitative qualitative evidence disease prior entry study , possible , treatment give concomitantly , allow evaluation net effect Glivec tumor growth kinetics , search measurable evidence response . Glivec supply study investigator Novartis Pharmaceutical . Patients receive Glivec 400mg-800mg p.o./day exposure period 12 month provide opinion investigator patient benefiting treatment Glivec , absence safety concern . For patient brain tumor receive concomitant enzyme induce anti-convulsant drug , recommend dose Glivec 800mg/day .</brief_summary>
