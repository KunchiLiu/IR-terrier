	<brief_title>Prone-Supine Study II : The Effect Prone Positioning Patients Affected Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The beneficial effect prone position arterial oxygenation well demonstrated ALI/ARDS patient . Moreover prone position impact distribution lung density . Finally , period prone position , respiratory compliance arterial oxygenation markedly improve compare pre-pronation value . Overall , evidence suggest prone positioning may affect outcome ARDS patient . Recently report effect prone position outcome ARDS patient . In study treatment consist 6 hour pronation daily first ten day onset acute respiratory failure . Although find difference outcome general population ARDS patient ( ten day , discharge ICU 6 month ) , post hoc analysis identify reduction mortality end 10-days treatment period quartile patient affect severe ARDS . A critical analysis methodological weakness previous study , together new information emerge study , lead adoption major change overall conception well operational design protocol : - substantial prolongation daily exposure prone position ( 6 minimum 20 hour ) ; - abolition time window duration treatment , stop except coincidence wean patient ; - predefined scheme apply mechanical ventilation group , base `` lung protective strategy '' concept . OBJECTIVE : To assess effect prone position mortality ARDS patient , stratify randomization accord predefined criterion severity respiratory failure . STUDY DESIGN : This randomize , control , multi-center study . The patient randomize two group : - Controls receive optimise standard intensive treatment , include protective ventilatory strategy ; - Treatment : extend ( least 20 hr ) daily prone positioning add control treatment . STUDY PROCEDURES : As soon patient assess term inclusion exclusion criterion , notify coordination center assign either control treatment group accord randomization scheme include stratification severity ARDS . On basis respiratory failure severity baseline , patient stratify : - Mild ARDS : 100≤PaO2/FiO2≤200 5≤PEEP≤10 cmH2O . - Severe ARDS : PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 100 5 cmH2O ≤ PEEP . The patient enrol randomization arm ventilate accord protective strategy . The prone position preferentially perform RotoProne® bed . The patient assign treatment group must put prone position daily : - least 20 hour ( + variation &gt; 2 hr must motivate CRF ) - 28 day Major non-compliance randomize treatment ( prone positioning control , withdrawal intervention group ) motivate CRF , expect occur well protect well-being patient . The originally assign randomize strategy must re-established soon possible . The end study treatment period 28 day randomization , extubation , whichever occur first . DATA COLLECTION : The data collection form send Coordinating Center . The data collect 12 hour interval ( two time daily ) . We perform `` Morning '' assessment `` Evening '' assessment . The assessment do least 30 minute manoeuvre could affect measurement ( i.g. , patient roll nursing , bronchoaspiration ) . - Controls group : `` morning '' `` Evening '' assessments do supine position 12 hour interval . - Treatment group : `` Morning '' assessment do supine position least 45 minute patient supine position ; `` Evening '' assessment , data collect prone position least 60 minute patient position . SAFETY ASPECTS AND SEVERE ADVERSE EVENTS ( SAE ) REPORTING : GCP rule strictly apply , include timely report study coordination within 48 hour occurrence SAEs include efficacy end-points . Clinical investigator nurse participate center instruct monitor specifically document adverse event likely associate study treatment . STUDY ORGANIZATION AND MONITORING : The center admit study select basis previous involvement multicenter clinical trial clinical experience application prone position . These criterion favour homogeneity and/or comparability standard background treatment , well monitor quality data . The overall coordination study task interdisciplinary group assures : - initial training investigator - real-time monitoring data foreseen CRF , close feed-back center ; - availability permanent 24 hour phone help-line , answer clinical operational query originate center ; - periodical organization ( least 2/yr ) meeting among participate team ( investigator nurse ) , ensure interactive discussion emerge problem ; - overall quality control management study data-base . STATISTICAL ASPECTS : The characteristic trial ( relative low frequency clinical condition , unavoidable concentration proning instrument limit number center , opportunity excessive prolongation recruitment period could coincide important modification way background care develops ) need consider define sample size . The primary outcome study overall mortality 28 day randomisation use sample size calculation . The study plan detect 15 percent absolute decrease 28 day mortality , power 80 percent , enrol 170 patient arm . The main analysis perform accord intention-to-treat approach . The primary endpoint monitor use sequential procedure Peto et al . There one interim analysis ass efficacy , schedule approximately ½ expect number patient recruit . Accordingly , correspond significance level evidence benefit stop trial α=0.01 . ADMINISTRATIVE , LEGAL , ETHICAL ISSUES : The Prone-Supine 2 study sponsor collaborative group , active last ten year conduct clinical trial intensive care ( 5 , 10 ) .The study plan manage independently , clinician take active part study receive economic incentive . The RotoProne® bed provide center producer ( KCI Medical Products , San Antonio , TX , USA ) , ensure also small financial support study co-ordination ( 50.000 USD/years ) . The data produce belong study group , ensure publication availability public authority . All data relate patient include study treat strict compliance Italian Laws relate privacy 675/1996 . The informed consent patient administer soon every time clinical condition patient compatible procedure , thus follow provision set forth ICH-GCP guideline ( 11 ) , confirm recent European Directive 2001/20/CE Decreto Legislativo 211 24/06/2003 . It worth recall legal basis require consent relative patient . COMMITTEES : Steering Committee L. Gattinoni , G. Tognoni ; Scientific Organizing Secretariat R. Fumagalli , R. Latini , A.
