	<brief_summary>There remarkable lack randomized trial concern potential benefit use arterial conduit coronary bypass surgery . This purpose present trial . Exclusive use arterial conduit might result improved conduit viability , reduce risk recurrent angina , myocardial infarction cardiac event , reduce need antianginal medication , improve functional status possibly improve long term survival .

	<brief_title>Copenhagen Arterial Revascularization Randomized Patency Outcome Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I : Background There remarkable lack randomized study concern potential benefit use arterial graft coronary revascularization . Numerous observational report consistently confirm , use LIMA-LAD graft associate increase peroperative mortality morbidity result approximately 10 % improve survival 10 year postoperatively . The average patency LIMA-LAD graft 80 % -85 % 10 year . 50 % vein graft occlude . LIMA-LAD grafting reduces risk late myocardial infarction , cardiac event reoperation , however effect recurrent angina need antianginal medication less certain . The question , whether bilateral IMA grafting long term benefit compare single IMA graft controversial . Numerous observational retrospective study fail demonstrate convincingly , bilateral IMA grafting reduces long term mortality improve frequency late cardiac event recurrent angina , data difficult compare due selection bias . It quite clear , minimal benefit represent true difference outcome , two different population compare . Whether increase degree arterial revascularization , include radial artery ( RA ) IMA graft , result improve long term survival , reduce risk recurrent angina , reinfarction , antianginal medication improve quality life , unclear . A randomized trial yet perform current observational 5 year follow-up data promising , document anticipated benefit stringent scientific point view . II : Hypothesis Coronary bypass grafting use LIMA + RIMA + RA ( total arterial revascularization ) vs. LIMA + saphenous vein graft result equal peroperative mortality morbidity rate improve long term outcome term improved patency rate , reduce risk recurrent angina , infarction cardiac event , reduce need antianginal medication , improve functional status possibly improve long term survival . III : Aim study Prospective randomize trial compare coronary bypass grafting use LIMA + RIMA + RA vs. LIMA + saphenous vein graft patient 2 3 vessel disease ( 1 graft anticipate ) respect : 1 . Graft patency rate 1 , 5 10 year postoperatively 2 . Cardiac event free survival 1 , 5 10 year postoperatively ( risk hospital readmission due infarction , suspicion infarction , unstable angina , arrythmias , heart insufficiency , need renew angiography , angioplasty , redo surgery ) 3 . Peroperative mortality morbidity 4 . Risk recurrent angina need antianginal medication 1 , 5 10 year postoperatively 5 . Data functional status social rehabilitation clinical control 3 month , 1 , 5 10 year postoperatively IV : Design &amp; method 1 . Design Prospective randomize trial . Patients randomize 2 group : Group A : Arterial revascularization LIMA + RIMA + RA . Group B : LIMA saphenous vein graft use graft material . 2 . Inclusion criterion - Patients 2 3 vessel coronary artery disease , 1 coronary bypass graft anticipate . - Elective subacute operation ( unstable AP surgery within day ) - Inclusion independent ventricular function , recent MI , degree type coronary lesion secondary risk factor diabetes , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , lung function , chronic obstructive lung disease , peripheral atherosclerotic disease , kidney function , early cerebrovascular disease . - Age : &lt; 70 year . - Sufficient collateral blood supply hand ulnar artery , evaluate Allen test . - Patients must able give informed consent . 3 . Exclusion criterion - Concurrent malignant disease expect survival &lt; 5 year . - Unsuitable saphenous vein graft evaluate preoperatively . - Unsuitable saphenous vein graft diameter &gt; 6mm evaluate peroperatively . - Acute operation ( unstable hemodynamics term need inotropic support , ongoing MI dynamic ECG change , cardiogenic shock ) . - Concommitant operation valve disease form heart surgery . - Redo operation . 4 . Surgery , anaesthesia postoperative care Surgery , anaesthesia postoperative care perform accord current guideline institution . 5 . Endpoints follow-up The study design respect two primary endpoint : 1 . Distal anastomotic patency rate 1 , 5 10 year postoperatively 2 . Cardiac event free survival 1 , 5 10 year postoperatively ( Cardiac event free survival define survival without readmission due infarction , suspicion infarction , unstable angina , arrythmias , heart insufficiency , need renew angiography , angioplasty , redo surgery ) Secondary endpoint : 1 . Peroperative mortality morbidity ( frequency peroperative/ postoperative infarction , arrythmias , use IABP , inotropic support , pulmonary , renal cerebral complication , length stay ICU , etc . accord registration scheme ) . 2 . Risk recurrent angina need antianginal medication 1 , 5 10 year postoperatively 3 . Data functional status social rehabilitation clinical control 3 month , 1 , 5 10 year postoperatively According endpoint follow-up plan : - 3 month clinical control refer hospital - 1 year control include angiography , perform outpatient basis . - 5 year control include conventional angiography compute tomography angiography . - 10 year control include compute tomography angiography , perform outpatient basis . 6 . Statistics Sample size calculate respect primary endpoint graft patency 1 5 year . A difference 10-15 % patency favour radial artery bypass graft regard clinically relevant . Observational data radial artery patency indicate patency rate 90-95 % 1 year 85 % 5 year , saphenous vein graft patency 80-90 % 1 year 60-70 % 5 year . To detect difference ( 15 % improved patency RA graft , 85 % vs 70 % ) 90 % probability ( type 2 error 0.10 ) significance level 0.05 , sample size group would n=150 . A 15 % difference patency rate 5 year opinion assumption probably overestimate vein graft patency , mean , sample size 150 patient group guarantee high probability statistically significant outcome .</detailed_description>
