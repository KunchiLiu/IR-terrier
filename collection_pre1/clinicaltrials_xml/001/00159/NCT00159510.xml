	<brief_summary>Nitric oxide ( NO ) play pivotal role maintenance normal vascular tone . However , sepsis excessive production NO result myocardial depression , vasoplegia , cytotoxic effect , thus promote shock multiple organ dysfunction . A recently complete study group show advantageous cardiovascular effect continuously infuse methylene blue ( MB ) , inhibitor NO pathway , human septic shock . In another investigation , find combination inhale NO continuously infuse MB attenuate endotoxin-induced acute lung injury ( ALI ) sheep . Our intention , new study , test hypothesis combination MB NO ( MB+NO ) improve cardiovascular pulmonary function well clinical outcome patient septic shock ALI . Forty mechanically ventilate patient diagnosed hyperdynamic septic shock ALI , randomize group receive 1 . Conventional treatment ( control group ) ( n =10 ) ; 2 . MB infusion addition conventional treatment ( n=10 ) ; 3 . Inhaled NO addition conventional treatment ( n=10 ) ; 4 . MB infusion combine inhaled NO ( MB+NO ) addition conventional treatment ( n=10 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The therapy either MB+NO NO MB alone prolong 24 h resolution septic shock , whichever occur first . MB inject bolus 2 mg/kg subsequently follow dose-titrated infusion . The latter begin 0.25 mg/kg/h continue within range 0.05 0.5 mg/kg/h . The goal maintain mean arterial pressure within range 70-90 mm Hg , purpose reduce concurrent vasopressor therapy . The NO therapy start 10 ppm aim maintain mean pulmonary artery pressure low possible level inhale NO concentration 1 20 ppm .</detailed_description>
