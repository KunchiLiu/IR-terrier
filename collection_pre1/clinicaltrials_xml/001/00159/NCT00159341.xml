	<brief_title>Cigarette Smoke Nasal Whole Blood Challenge Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common respiratory disease cause widespread morbidity mortality , Global Burden Disease Study estimate COPD currently sixth common cause death worldwide . Decades cigarette smoking far major contribute factor , cause range respiratory disorder ; include chronic bronchitis , obstructive bronchiolitis , emphysema , pulmonary vascular disease . Medical treatment COPD largely palliative ; involve smoke cessation , use inhale bronchodilator , long term oxygen therapy respiratory failure . Recently , recognise smoker develop COPD amplification inflammation compare `` healthy smoker '' , urgent need develop new challenge model ass COPD develop heavy smoker . Cigarette Smoke Nasal Challenge Model The nose accessible part respiratory system , possible obtain tissue exudate cell brushing non−invasive manner . A comprehensive review extensive clinical research experience nasal methodology recently publish . There also insight patient COPD commonly inflammation airway nasal passage , similar type inflammatory infiltrate lower upper airway . In COPD inflammation predominantly involve neutrophil macrophage , opposed increase mast cell eosinophils characteristic asthma . It long recognise strong functional immunological relationship nose bronchus , especially term infiltrate leukocyte inflammatory mediator compare allergic rhinitis allergic asthma . The upper low airway related respiratory epithelium similar response allergen challenge . The nasal bronchial mucosa smoker COPD demonstrate infiltrated CD8+ T lymphocytes neutrophils . This correspond presence nasal symptom exacerbation COPD , sputum nasal level IL−8 correlate COPD . In order sample nasal exudate allergic inflammatory mediator , classical method nasal lavage describe Naclerio et al. , nasal pool method Greiff et al. , use Foley 's catheter Grünberg colleague . Lavage perform saline volume 1 10ml . The repeatability validity different nasal lavage method compare . Tommy Sim colleague develop use filter paper strip , place turbinate absorb nasal secretion . The nasal filter paper method advantage directly sample nasal secretion less dilute therefore pick protein signal detection limit nasal lavage . The matrix filter paper method use measure chemokines cytokine NAC . Cells sample may obtain nasal mucosal use small nylon dental flossing brush gently rotate epithelium , attach cell dislodge balanced salt solution . It demonstrate nasal brushing use alternative nasal biopsy [ 24 ] , whilst nasal brush supernatant analyse cytokine release [ 25 ] . An alternative method employ nasal mucosal scraping use plastic curette ( Rhinoprobe , Arlington Scientific , Utah ) . Nasal brush scrap cause discomfort require local anaesthesia . Nasal biopsy generally perform low edge inferior turbinate specialist . This traumatic procedure require careful local anaesthesia , specimen mucosal epithelium basement membrane submucosal tissue obtain . Nasal allergen challenge ( NAC ) proven benefit test novel anti−inflammatory therapy allergic rhinitis asthma . NAC advantage inhale allergen challenge since easy recruit subject , less invasive , repeated tissue sample readily obtain . Small number patient give even single dos therapy , anti−inflammatory clinical effect NAC response note . Using challenge method phase II drug development asthma allergic rhinitis possible provide early reliable `` Go/No Go '' decision embark large−scale , long−term costly phase III study . We hope develop analogous challenge model COPD assess effect nasal challenge cigarette smoke . A major challenge develop phase IIa clinical pharmacology design use assess anti−inflammatory drug develop COPD . Nasal epithelial inflammatory response ozone exposure much study [ 31−39 ] . Indeed COPD characterise chronic inflammation imbalance oxidant/antioxidant level , systemic inflammation may trigger local exercise−induced oxidative stress . Three year clinical trial involve thousand patient find inhaled corticosteroid affect accelerated rate loss lung function COPD . Furthermore , ongoing phase III trial oral phosphodiesterase type 4 ( PDE4 ) inhibitor also unconvincing , despite initial small study look promising . There clearly compel need develop non−invasive biomarkers clinical challenge model use phase II clinical pharmacology study enable reliable assessment effect anti−inflammatory therapy COPD . Use nasal challenge model couple sensitive biomarkers clinical endpoint could perhaps use establish clinical efficacy new drug COPD small scale study . Novel therapies potential selectively inhibit various cell type particular mediator involve diverse inflammatory disease . We believe nasal allergen challenge advantage inhale challenge : safety , repeat non−invasive sampling . In future ensure nasal challenge play grow role clinical pharmacology assessment anti−inflammatory therapy . Major effort ongoing develop nasal challenge model mimic inflammation find COPD , use clinical pharmacology assessment new anti−inflammatory drug . Whole Blood Challenge vitro Cigarette Smoke We shall stimulate blood sample laboratory vitro manner cigarette smoke extract . The cigarette smoke extract produce fume cabinet ensure safety laboratory personnel . Cigarette smoke contains many toxic compound include free radical oxidant . Cigarette smoke condition medium ( CSCM ) make bubble smoke burn cigarette buffer salt solution , use stimulate cell vitro . Cigarette smoke extract show cytotoxic alveolar type II cell−derived line effect block N−acetyl cysteine scavenger oxidant . { Hoshino , Mio , et al . 2001 7463 /id } . We develop method assess neutrophil CD11b upregulation response stimulation cytokine chemokines . CD11b cell surface receptor leukocytes mobilised intracellular store cell stimulate . Surface CD11b measure use fluorescent label antibody flow cytometry . We develop method stimulating whole blood CSCM produce 200 % increase CD11b upregulation incubation 20 minute . This effect increase plasma remove whole blood prior stimulation , effect partially inhibit presence reduce glutathione . COPD patient smoker show decreased antioxidant capacity plasma . We aim compare neutrophil response CSCM stimulation whole blood , wash blood plasma remove , compare neutrophil responsiveness COPD patient smoker possible anti−oxidant effect plasma . Overview plan research Two characterise match group smoker COPD `` healthy '' smoker lung disease enrol study . Each group comprise 8 subject . Each subject require make 2 visit NHLI Clinical Studies Unit follow : Visit 1 : Screening During screening , candidate study fully inform nature study possible AEs . Candidates must read consent form sign document investigator answer question candidate 's satisfaction . Further procedure begin consent form sign . Two original informed consent form copy sign subject . An original signed consent form retain investigator second original give candidate take home . Candidates evaluate entry study accord state inclusion exclusion criterion . The following procedure perform establish candidate 's general health qualification enrollment study : - Obtain sign , write informed consent - Record medication history past 30 day Record medical history , include smoking status - Perform physical examination heart , lung nose - Pregnancy test female subject child bear age - Conduct spirometry test reversibility - Review inclusion exclusion criteria The investigator evaluate result examination include clinical laboratory test determine candidate 's suitability study . When subject suitable study , blood sample ( 10mls ) take cigarette smoke whole blood challenge . Visit 2 : Nasal smoke challenge Each subject allow smoke least 5 cigarette 9am 9pm day attend unit , previous 7 day . On study day , patient ask smoke single cigarette exhale nose . Following cigarette challenge , carry follow procedure period 8 hour ( pre ( x2 ) , 1h , 2h , 3h , 4h,6h 8h ) : 1 . Nasal lavage consist wash nose 5ml ( teaspoon ) warm salt solution . This solution gently pass syringe hollow `` olive '' end leave nostril . The fluid enter sinuses pass back nose . A total 2 flush carry timepoints . 2 . Nasal filter paper consist 7mm x 30mm strip paper gently place inside end right nostril . They leave to2 minute moist nasal secretion . 3 . A cannula insert enable blood take time point serum analysis cytokine chemokines . 4 . Pregnancy test female subject child bear age . As part study , subject inform harmful effect cigarette smoking , advise need stop smoking . Subjects offer smoking class help stop smoking . It anticipate study day set quit date subject .</detailed_description>
