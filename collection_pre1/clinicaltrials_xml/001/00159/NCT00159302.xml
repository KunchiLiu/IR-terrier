	<brief_summary>This pilot study measure baseline level intra- inter-subject variability exhale ( alveolar bronchial ) nasal NO smoke subject mild moderate COPD steroid treatment , smoke healthy volunteer non-smoking mild asthmatic steroid , use multiple exhalation flow rate . In addition , exploratory marker iNOS activity ( eg . 3-nitrotyrosine , nitrite , nitrate 3-nitro-4-hydoxyphenylacetic acid ) blood , sputum , urine exhale breath condensate evaluate . We also evaluate exhale nasal NO population mild asthmatic order obtain baseline variability data future clinical study involve asthmatic subject .</brief_summary>
