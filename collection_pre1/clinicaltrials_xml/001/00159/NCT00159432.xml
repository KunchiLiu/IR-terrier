	<brief_summary>This study people colorectal cancer , tumor completely remove surgery . This study do find long take tumor grow patient receive drug capecitabine , oxaliplatin bevacizumab . Capecitabine ( also call Xeloda ) drug approve FDA treatment advance colorectal cancer . Capecitabine prevent colorectal cancer cancer cell reproduce , cause die . Oxaliplatin ( also call Eloxatin ) also approve FDA treatment advance colorectal cancer . Oxaliplatin prevents colorectal cancer cell reproduce . Bevacizumab investigational drug . Bevacizumab antibody ( protein act specific substance ) direct vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . VEGF promote growth blood vessel bring nutrient cell . Bevacizumab inhibit growth colon cancer cell , block effect VEGF . The combination drug use study experimental . The purpose study see long take patient ' tumor grow take combination drug .</brief_summary>
