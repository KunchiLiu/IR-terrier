	<brief_summary>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE : Transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) standard surgical intervention obstructive benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) large gland , typically treat open simple prostatectomy . Recently , new generation laser ( holmium potassium titanyl phosphate [ KTP ] ) utilize BPH treatment . Long-term follow-up laser prostatectomy outcomes must document fully characterize degree void improvement achievable new technique , durability outcome , safety profile procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) affect 40 % men age 60 ( Kirby RS , 2000 ) . For patient significant obstructive symptom help medical therapy , surgical intervention institute . Transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) , endoscopic procedure prostate tissue sequentially remove electrocautery loop , remain gold standard surgical therapy compare . Unfortunately , TURP associate significant patient morbidity blood loss dilutional hyponatremia , especially resection time prolong ( Mebust WK et al , 1989 ) . Because long resection time increase morbidity risk involve patient extremely large prostate gland , open simple prostatectomy traditionally employed place TURP remove obstruct adenoma tissue . However , patient could still expect prolonged hospital stay high likelihood post-operative transfusion . Many alternative surgical treatment BPH develop attempt minimize morbidity profile traditional surgical approach . New generation holmium ( 2140 nm wavelength ) KTP ( 532 nm wavelength ) laser offer minimally invasive alternative BPH treatment broadly term laser prostatectomy . Within category laser prostatectomy , two distinctly separate technique develop . The first , laser ablation , involve vaporization obstructive prostate tissue . Effective ablation achieve either holmium KTP laser . Previous group report favorable outcome minimal associate morbidity treat small prostate laser ablation technique ( Hai MA Malek RS , 2003 ) . The property holmium laser also enable cut soft tissue maintain hemostasis , utilized dissecting entire prostatic lobe away prostatic capsule . This procedure term holmium laser enucleation prostate ( HoLEP ) , perform even large gland duplicate result open simple prostatectomy much less morbidity ( Gilling PJ et al , 2000 Moody JA Lingeman JE , 2001 ) . We perform holmium KTP prostate ablation extensive clinical experience HoLEP procedure . Our impression various laser prostatectomy procedure outcome appear substantiate finding aforementioned study . However , extend follow-up patient undergo laser prostatectomy documentation outcomes associated complication must do order support initial conclusion previous investigator . SPECIFIC AIMS : To review outcome population patient BPH undergone laser prostatectomy . We hypothesize long-term improvement void parameter achieve new laser procedure compare favorably perhaps well result previously report TURP , case large gland , open simple prostatectomy . In addition , adverse events/complication profile laser procedure well traditional treatment . Once retrospective data review , continue collect outcome data prospective basis .</detailed_description>
