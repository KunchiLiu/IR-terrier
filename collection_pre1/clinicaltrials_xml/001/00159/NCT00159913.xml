	<criteria>Male female subject age 1 17 year old weigh &gt; = 8 kg mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt; = 25 mmHg rest , PCWP &lt; = 15 mmHg , PVRI &gt; = 3 Wood unit x m2 ( PCWP available , mean LA pressure &lt; = 15 mmHg LVEDP &lt; = 15 mmHg absence leave atrial obstruction ) . Females child bear potential sexually active must practice suitable method birth control opinion investigator , would become pregnant study . Subjects symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension due : primary pulmonary hypertension ; pulmonary arterial hypertension presence small hemodynamically insignificant congenital systemic pulmonary shunt lesion opinion investigator cause pulmonary hypertension ; collagen vascular disease ; congenital systemictopulmonary shunt baseline rest room air oxygen saturation &gt; = 88 % unrepaired repair least 6 month prior screen ; dtransposition great artery repair within first 30 day life ; surgical repair congenital heart lesion least 6 month prior screen clinically significant residual leftsided heart disease consistent exclusion criterion . Subjects , developmentally able exercise , whose CPX exercise test functional capacity within follow parameter : Peak VO2 &gt; = 10 mL/kg/min &lt; = 28 mL/kg/min screen CPX test ; Written inform consent assent applicable subject screen study . Subjects undergo large shift altitude ( define approximately 5000 foot 1524 meter ) order participate study must reside `` study '' altitude least 90 day prior baseline study period . Subjects pulmonary hypertension secondary sickle cell disease , disease know associated PAH , etiology specify inclusion criterion . Leftsided heart disease , include aortic mitral valve disease ( great mild ) , restrictive congestive cardiomyopathy ; PCWP LVEDP &gt; 15 mmHg ; LVEF &lt; 40 % determined MUGA , angiography echocardiography ; LV shorten fraction &lt; 22 % determined echocardiography , symptomatic coronary disease ( demonstrable ischemia ) . Pericardial constriction ; significant ( 2+ regurgitation ) valvular disease tricuspid pulmonary regurgitation ; acutely decompensated heart failure within previous 30 day screen ; atrial septostomy within previous 6 month screen ; Hemodynamic instability hypo hypertension screening , i.e. , SBP outside 70â€‘140 mmHg . A history stroke , myocardial infarction life threaten arrhythmia within 6 month screen . Moderate severe restrictive pulmonary disease ( Total Lung Capacity Forced Vital Capacity &lt; = 60 % normal ) history severe lung disease . Subjects bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) chronic lung disease . History pulmonary embolism . Subjects whose CPX test limit condition pulmonary hypertensionassociated dyspnea fatigue . Subjects know HIV positive Subjects impairment renal function ( serum creatinine &gt; 2.5x ULN ) hepatic function ( ALT and/or AST &gt; 3x ULN ; and/or bilirubin &gt; = 2 mg/dL ) . Hematological abnormality ( e.g. , severe anemia , Hgb &lt; 10 g/dL , leukopenia , WBC &lt; 2500/mL ) . Subjects previously receive bosentan whose liver function test take screen &gt; 2x ULN . Subjects medical condition opinion investigator may interfere treatment , evaluation safety , and/or efficacy . Change class medication CHF PAH within 10 day prior qualify right heart catheterization . Subjects currently prescribe and/or take nitrate nitric oxide donor form . Acute vasodilator test nitric oxide permit hemodynamic evaluation ; take chronic arginine supplementation include Heart Bar ; therapy involve parenteral inotropic medication parenteral vasodilator within 3 month screen ; current therapy alphablockers , potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor ( e.g. , erythromycin , ketoconazole , itraconazole protease inhibitor ) , Ritonavir Nicorandil ; chronic treatment offlabel sildenafil , endothelin antagonist prostacyclin/prostacyclin analogue within 30 day randomization . Pregnant lactate female . Any medical psychological condition social circumstance would impair ability participate reliably study likely complete study reason ; current past illicit drug use alcoholism except abstinence document &gt; = 1 year . Participation another clinical trial investigational drug device ( include placebo ) within 30 day screen entry present study . Subjects know hereditary degenerative retinal disorder ( retinitis pigmentosa ) history nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy ( NAION ) .</criteria>
