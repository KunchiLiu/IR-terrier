	<brief_summary>Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) , fatal muscle degenerative disorder , arise mutation dystrophin gene . Antisense therapy use antisense oligonucleotides ( AON ) potential restore effectively production dystrophin , defective protein , &gt; 70 % DMD . This could result increased life expectancy improve muscle survival function . Recent scientific research demonstrate potential technique skip mutate dystrophin exon , restore read frame generate functional dystrophin protein . Having demonstrate proof-of-principle human cell culture animal model study , intend determine efficacy safety approach induce dystrophin exon skip child DMD . The specific aim phase I/II study ass efficacy ( dystrophin production ) safety intramuscular administer morpholino oligomer direct exon 51 ( AVI-4658 PMO ) . We perform parallel preclinical study develop method systemic delivery necessary future phase II/III clinical study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Antisense Oligonucleotides Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) common form muscular dystrophy affect 1 every 3500 live male birth . The disease characterise severe muscle waste weakness , become clinically evident age 3 5 year . Affected individual stop walk 12 year age usually survive beyond age 20 unless ventilate . In general DMD cause mutation disrupt reading frame thus leading failure express dystrophin . Recent scientific research lead belief DMD may treat correct genetic error dystrophin gene cause DMD . Most child DMD deletion , i.e. , mutation remove part dystrophin gene . A novel technique use antisense technology skip specific exon bypass faulty genetic material , thus allow production functional dystrophin produce , developed.These antisense oligonucleotides ( AON ) target bypass faulty genetic material allow production functional protein.This successfully demonstrate cultured human DMD cell mouse canine DMD models.The restore production dystrophin predict reduce muscle pathology significantly . In early part study compare different antisense oligomers chemical modification conclude morpholino backbone significantly superior administer skeletal muscle compare number type antisense . The aim phase I/II clinical study ass efficacy safety AVI-4658 , morpholino antisense direct exon 51 , DMD individual deletion would benefit skip exon 51 . The propose work present 4 section detail main approach . Study design This dose escalation IM trial involve 9 subject , subdivide three group , three subject . Patients group 1 recruit sequentially whilst patient group 2 3 recruit serially . - Group 1 ( 3 patient ) receive intramuscular administration low concentration study drug ( extensor digitorum brevis muscle , EDB ) undergo muscle biopsy day 14 28 intramuscular ( IM ) administration AVI-4658 . - Group 2 ( 3 patient ) undergo identical procedure receive intermediate dose AVI-4658 . - Group 3 ( 3 patient ) recruit receive high dose AVI-4658 result first 2 cohort patient show lack efficacy low dos . Up additional 3 subject may enrol cohort 1 2 , cohort 3 enrol . Screening - A physical examination , include body weight , height , arm span , neuromuscular examination vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , respiration , temperature ) . - Neuropsychiatric assessment subject family . - Molecular genetic blood sample dystrophin analysis original muscle biopsy obtain diagnosis . - Muscle MRI scan low limbs ass preservation muscle target injection AON . - Biochemical ( blood ) urine investigation include standard biochemistry haematology ( FBC ; coagulation screen ; LFT ; serum Ig ; protein electrophoresis ; inflammatory marker ; CK ; gamma GT ; urine biochemistry ) . - Cardiovascular assessment : ECG heart echocardiogram . - Pulmonary assessment : FVC , overnight oxygen saturation monitoring . - Skin biopsy MyoD-transfection . Procedure - The muscle use extensor digitorum brevis , foot muscle little function child mobility difficulty . - Local injection perform directly skin use combine EMG-delivery needle . While procedure could perform local anaesthetic ; possible , perform general anaesthetic order reduce distress subject . A skin tattoo feature 1 cm x 1 cm grid 2 line divide 9 small square use mark site injection precisely subsequent muscle biopsy . - The total volume injection 100 μL contain AVI-4658 . Nine injection perform 3 mm interval inside 1 cm2 grid tattoo . The depth injection carefully record . Observation - Patients closely monitor within clinical research facility designate nursing staff educate trial protocol experience similar Phase I/II study . - The clinical research facility close access intensive care unit facility event unforeseen adverse reaction . Follow-up Day 2 - Patients discharge . Prior discharge , brief physical examination system review perform . Day 3 - A brief physical examination system review include examination injection sit report reaction . This examination perform local surgery hospital refer clinician . Days 5 , 7 - Contact subject inquire current status . Day 14 28 - The subject admit hospital . Perform system assessment ( physical examination ) , body weight vital sign . Blood urine biochemistry repeat well open biopsy inject muscle perform general local anaesthetic . Day 30 - Contact subject inquiry current status . Day 60 - Contact subject inquiry current status . Day 120 - ( Final Visit hospital study drug administer ) . A brief physical examination system review perform . MDEX Consortium .
