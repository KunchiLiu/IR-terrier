	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : To evaluate long act injectable form risperidone offer clinical advantage comparison oral second generation antipsychotic agent follow titration stabilization bipolar subject . In keep current practice , expect vast majority patient also receive either lithium valproate anticonvulsant . Following stabilization phase several clinical event evaluate 15 month two treatment group examine difference clinical outcome receive injectable versus oral medicine . RESEARCH PLAN : We intend recruit 50 consent adult subject DSM-IV TR diagnose bipolar disorder initiate switch antipsychotic agent . Patients titrate cross-tapered 3 month titration stabilization phase . Those transition successfully show improvement follow additional 12 month . Clinical outcome study drop , adverse event , worsen symptom , crisis intervention , need additional medication , hospitalization etc . evaluated month 3 15 . The number clinical event ( pool ) use evaluate long act injectable form risperidone advantage oral second generation antipsychotic agent term treatment continuity clinical stability . METHODS : An open design , treatment either long act risperidone oral second generation antipsychotic agent randomly assign . A board independent day-to-day clinical event code primary clinical outcome interest without knowledge treatment assignment . The board provide clinical summary event without reveal treatment assignment . SIGNIFICANCE : The use long act injectable second generation antipsychotic agent may offer advantage treatment continuity adherence bipolar patient permit improved clinical stability improve psychosocial functional outcome . Such stability difficult achieve face frequent treatment discontinuation see oral agent . The improved tolerability second generation antipsychotic agent may change perception long acting injection . For instance , agent likely acceptable patient , family clinician therefore likely use much sooner treatment algorithms bipolar patient past . This study provide treatment effect size statistically power future comparison long-acting injectable vs. oral antipsychotic agent person bipolar disorder</detailed_description>
