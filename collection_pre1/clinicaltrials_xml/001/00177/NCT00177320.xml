	<detailed_description>Computers allow individual engage economic , social , entertainment activity . They vital full participation many area society , become necessity many type employment , particularly management administrative position . Despite many benefit computer use , many individual rheumatic disease rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , osteoarthritis ( OA ) , fibromyalgia ( FM ) may unable use computer due limitation hand function sit ability . These limitation prevent physical manipulation computer peripheral inhibit ability sit extend period time computer . Despite importance computer use almost information problem individual rheumatic disease experience use computer . Baseline information type problem experience individual rheumatic disease well magnitude problem need method develop intervene remediate . The aim study complete need assessment problem experience rheumatic disease computer use . This assessment lay groundwork development outcome measure intervention improve computer use individual rheumatic disease identify problem area examine magnitude problem . This study implement two phase . In Phase I ( month 01-05 ) use several focus group session 5-10 participant acquire consumer input develop refine survey examine problem experience computer use people rheumatic disease . In Phase II survey develop Phase I { Computer Problem Survey ( ComPS ) ] administer representative sample patient rheumatic disease ( n = ~1500 ) ascertain type magnitude computer problem ( month 06-12 ) . These 2 phase use answer follow question : 1 . What aspects computer use report problem individual RA , OA , FM ? 2 . What magnitude problem individual RA , OA , FM ? 3 . How magnitude differ examine age , gender , education , race/ethnicity , work status ? At end study gather descriptive data necessary 1 ) begin modify current computer performance evaluation focus measure computer use performance individual rheumatic disease ; 2 ) develop test intervention , adaptive equipment ergonomics , promote continue computer use individual difficulty use computer due physical limitation .</detailed_description>
