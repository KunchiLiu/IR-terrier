	<brief_summary>This single-blinded , one-treatment , combination dose escalation pharmacokinetic study do healthy volunteer . The investigator want determine whether Parathyroid Hormone relate Protein ( 1-36 ) [ PTHrP ( 1-36 ) ] share anabolic property currently approve anabolic agent , parathyroid hormone ( 1-34 ) [ PTH ( 1-34 ) ] , stimulate osteoblastic bone resorption formation . In previous study do investigator , postmenopausal osteoporotic woman estrogen receive 6.56 mcg/kg PTHrP ( 1-36 ) subcutaneously three month daily . They experience 4.7 % increase bone mineral density ( BMD ) lumbar spine compare take placebo . They also display increase serum osteocalcin , marker bone formation , change several marker bone resorption . It believe rapid absorption clearance PTHrP ( 1-36 ) likely plays central role anabolic effect In order ass absorption , combine pharmacokinetic dose escalation method study intravenous PTHrP give via one-time bolus injection . The purpose define maximum safe dose measure pharmacokinetic parameter single intravenous dose Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein ( 1-36 ) [ PTHrP ( 1-36 ) ] . The result useful determining future treatment option osteoporosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>`` PTHrP ( 1-36 ) IV Dose Escalation Study ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis grow health problem . The commonly use treatment option anti-resorptive agent , give bone density increase lumbar spine 6-8 % range 3-5 year period . A 100 % increase bone mass would need restore bone mass peak , premenopausal level . The ideal drug treat osteoporosis would pure skeletal anabolic agent ; however , currently approve anabolic agent , parathyroid hormone [ PTH ( 1-34 ) ] appear increase lumbar spine mass 12-15 % 2-3 year period give alone . Parathyroid hormone-related protein , [ PTHrP ( 1-36 ) ] , peptide secrete almost normal tissue cell share significant homology Parathyroid Hormone ( PTH ) ; investigator believe share anabolic property PTH . In previous study , PTHrP ( 1-36 ) administer subcutaneously postmenopausal woman two week increase marker bone formation ( osteocalcin ) decrease marker osteoclastic bone resorption . In subsequent study , postmenopausal osteoporotic woman estrogen receive 6.56 mcg/kg PTHrP ( 1-36 ) subcutaneously 3 month daily . They experience 4.7 % increase bone mineral density ( BMD ) lumbar spine compare take placebo . The also displayed increase serum osteocalcin , marker bone formation , change several marker bone resorption . As result rat human research study , investigator feel rapid absorption clearance PTHrP ( 1-36 ) likely plays central role anabolic effect human . In order ass absorption PTHrP , investigator pharmacokinetic study use bolus intravenous PTHrP . It combine pharmacokinetic dose escalation method study intravenous PTHrP give via one-time bolus injection . Subcutaneous PTHrP show increase bone mass previous study do would prefer route administration PTHrP treatment osteoporosis . Comparing intravenous subcutaneous PTHrP yield much information bioavailability PTHrP vivo . This six hour study design achieve goal ( 1 ) determine maximum safe dose PTHrP ( 1-36 ) give intravenously one time bolus dose ; ( 2 ) pharmacokinetic profile one-time intravenous bolus dose PTHrP . A placebo group 5 subject initially serve control . The investigator feel important begin small amount intravenous PTHrP gradually increase dose safety reason . The initial single bolus intravenous dose test intentionally low ( 4 microgram ) . Subsequent dos PTHrP gradually increase use standard dose escalation scale group three subject maximal dose 400 mcg reach dose limiting toxicity occur dose low 400 mcg . The maximum determine safely tolerate dose administer total 10 normal healthy volunteer . In subject different dose group , frequent blood sample within first 20 minute IV administration PTHrP yield pharmacokinetic data peak PTHrP blood level time peak level T ( max ) . After research subject receive intravenous bolus PTHrP ; blood sample collect pharmacokinetic analysis PTHrP intervals 2 minute first 20 minute , 25 , 30 , 45 60 minute , hourly next five hour . Measurement calcium , creatinine , phosphorus , PTH , 1,25 Vitamin D marker bone metabolism obtain baseline , hour one three . After baseline urine sample obtain , urine collect two hour interval calcium , creatinine , phosphorus , marker bone metabolism . All subject assign single-blinded manner receive either placebo study drug . Initial subject assign receive placebo start dose PTHrP : 4 microgram . group subject receive PTHrP placebo via intravenous bolus injection follow 3 ml normal saline solution flush 30-60 period . If subject initial group experience adverse effect , dose intravenous PTHrP increase subsequent group three subject , dose group 10 , 40 , 75 , 150 , 250 lastly , 400 microgram . 400 microgram high possible dose give study . The dose cause dose-limiting toxicity give total 10 healthy subject . Data dose group use compare data investigator 's previous pharmacokinetic dose escalation study , include recently complete double-blind , crossover pharmacokinetic study compare peak serum level PTH ( 1-34 ) PTHrP ( 1-36 ) single subcutaneous injection . Preliminary result study indicated PTHrP peak earlier PTH ( 6-15 minute verse 45 minute ) , despite fact dose PTHrP ( ~420 mcg ) 20 time great dose PTH ( 20 mcg ) . This study perform healthy young adult , age 24-35 year . It anticipate need screen 100 subject achieve maximum 52 evaluable subject , answer question pose study .</detailed_description>
