	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study lung transplant recipient undergo lung transplantation . Patients identified pulmonologist perform bronchoscopy . The patient 's serum ( obtain one time blood draw 10 milliliter - two tablespoon ) cell pellet BAL frozen -70ยบ C. Once active non- OB status determine pathologist , store BAL fluid ( cell pellet ) analyze . C.pneumoniae serum titer also measure compare stored pre-transplant serum . Left cell pellet BAL fluid use measure presence C. pneumoniae PCR method . Additionally PCR perform virus ( CMV , EBV , HHV6 &amp; 7 , human metapneumo virus human rhino virus ) . In addition , bronchoscopy procedure part patient 's standard care , biopsy obtain . This do bronchoscopy procedure . The tissue send pathology lab . We collect residual ( excess ) tissue sample perform research relate test . This test determine predict type infection early onset rejection . These determination assist clinician administer appropriate dosage level antibiotic require prevent treat infection help stop rejection process . The subject ask question pulmonary symptom take five minute one investigator study coordinator . The subject 's medical record review demographic information ( age , sex , race ) , lab result ( standard post transplant care ) , medication information , well testing/procedures transplant follow-up period . This information result tests/procedures become part research record .</detailed_description>
