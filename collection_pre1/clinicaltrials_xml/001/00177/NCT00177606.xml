	<brief_title>Donors After Cardiac Death : Validating Identification Criteria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study simple , observational study . We intend record event occur time withdrawal life sustain treatment occurs , time death . Our preliminary data , report journal Critical Care Medicine Pediatric Critical Care Medicine , show median time death 25 minute , survive hour . We would directly observe patient longer one hour . This straightforward study characterize Receiver Operator Characteristic ( ROC ) curve Relative Risk variety clinical data element predict early death follow discontinuation life sustain treatment . This multi-center study currently conduct : University Cincinnati Hospital , Case-Western Reserve University Hospital University Pittsburgh Medical Center University Pittsburgh act Coordinating Center . ( ) This prospective cohort study patient electively withdraw life sustain treatment . The investigator study impact decision timing withdrawal support . The study merely record time support withdrawn , medication provide patient comfort , time death . Within group , determine whether patient `` meet '' UNOS criterion ( UNOS cohort ) short time death , enable u validate current , unvalidated UNOS criterion . In addition , analyze data patient , perform logistic regression determine candidate criterion determine short time death . ( b ) Data extractor collect data identify patient use chart review follow procedure approve institutional review board . Data form de-identified institution prior transmission central database ensure patient confidentiality . The result project propose enable accurate identification appropriate candidate NHBOD . We plan examine pre-mortem data patient die withdrawal LST see factor combination factor predictive death le 30 minute 60 minute LST remove . Our research question : 1 . Do UNOS criteria predict early death follow discontinuation LST ? 2 . In addition collect data enable u address secondary question : 2. . What best predictor early death follow discontinuation LST ? , 2.b . How accurate ? We intend test follow two hypothesis : H1 : The UNOS criterion predictive death le 30 minute ; H2 : The UNOS criterion predictive death within 60 minute . The researcher select follow outcomes study . Outcome 1 : death within 30 minute removal life sustain treatment . Outcome 2 : death within 60 minute removal life sustain treatment . Outcome 3 : number potential organ donor follow cardiac death</detailed_description>
