	<brief_summary>The keratinocytes lesional skin vitiligo compare normal perilesional skin differentially express gene correlate melanocyte death . Narrow Band UVB hopefully reverse pattern gene expression back toward normal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examination Of Vitiligo Skin Samples Before After UVB Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitiligo disease cause disappearance melanocyte epidermis . The pathogenesis vitiligo multifactorial . Theories include autoimmunity , neural , apoptosis cytotoxicity . The medical treatment vitiligo marginal 40-60 % response rate guarantee full repigmentation . Understanding pathogenesis vitiligo allow good target treatment . Previous analysis skin biopsy find several change gene expression occur immune regulation , DNA replication repair , oncogene , signal transducer transcription factor . These result give u insight happen lesional v nonlesional skin contains epidermis , dermis , fat , blood vessel immune cell . We technology today study specific cell population tissue use laser capture microdissection . We propose use technique study keratinocyte population vitiligo skin past evidence suggests may play role . In addition , role keratinocytes vitiligo may important treatment would ideal target therapy . Keratinocytes study vitiligo . The aim study isolate keratinocytes normal skin , perilesional lesional skin vitiligo patient laser capture microdissection characterize gene expression profile gene microarray analysis compare keratinocyte gene expression normal , perilesional lesional vitiligo skin narrow band UVB treatment .</detailed_description>
