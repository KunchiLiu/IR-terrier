	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine early initiation long act insulin ( i.e . glargine ) supplemental dose short act regular ( SSR ) insulin hospitalize patient diabetes fed use tube feeding reduce frequency high low blood sugar level compare use SSR insulin alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Glargine Insulin Glucose Control Hospitalized Patients Who Receive Tube Feedings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperglycemia one frequently encounter complication enteral nutrition therapy hospital setting . However , standardize approach direct towards identification management patient develop hyperglycemia receive enteral nutrition . The primary aim study determine early initiation subcutaneous glargine insulin supplemental dos slide scale human regular ( SSR ) insulin hospitalize subject diabetes receive enteral nutrition reduces frequency hyperglycemia hypoglycemia compare use SSR insulin alone . In proposal , plan investigate strategy early insulin therapy management hospitalized subject diabetes mellitus develop hyperglycemia define two blood glucose ( BG ) measurement great 130 mg/dl within 48 hour prior within 48 hour period enteral nutrition therapy . The study phase IV , investigator initiate randomize , parallel group clinical trial . Potential subject include subject write order initiation enteral feeding use formula contain carbohydrate . Consented subject bedside glucose monitoring perform every 6 hour first 48 hour follow initiation enteral nutrition determine hyperglycemia occur . To determine difference mean plasma glucose 25 mg/dl hospital LOS 4 day two group 0.01 power 0.9 , 25 subject randomize group ( total 50 subject ) . Baseline outcome variable two group compare use Student 's t-testing , chi-square analysis , Mann-Whitney U test . Group 1 receive single daily dose glargine insulin along slide scale regular human ( SSR ) insulin titrate accord blood glucose result . Group 2 receive slide scale human regular ( SSR ) insulin titrate accord algorithm . Both group follow daily enteral feeding discontinue maximum three week .</detailed_description>
