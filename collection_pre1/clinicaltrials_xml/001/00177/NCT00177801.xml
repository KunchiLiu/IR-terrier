	<brief_summary>Fungal infection lead cause morbidity mortality transplant recipient , yet comprehensive epidemiologic study area lacking . For reason , Centers Disease Control Prevention provide grant University Pittsburgh study subject . The study four specific aim : 1 . To determine risk fungal infection center `` tolerogenic '' immunosuppressive protocol currently place , determine whether measure immune system function correlate risk fungal infection . 2 : To create repository serum , urine bronchoalveolar lavage specimen purpose determine effectiveness novel diagnostic test invasive fungal infection . Such repository could also utilized purpose determine effectiveness novel diagnostic test viral infection West Nile Virus , cytomegalovirus , HHV-6 HHV-8 . Specific aim 1 investigated create prospective database solid organ transplant recipient University Pittsburgh Medical Center , include demographic factor well subsequent development infection . The immune function patient assess measure T cell subset assess T cell function use Cylex assay . Specific aim 2 involve collection serum , urine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid . These specimen store later test Centers Disease Control Prevention assessment novel test develop diagnosis invasive fungal infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This longitudinal cohort study . Participation research database limit placement subject ' identifiable medical information relate organ transplantation immunosuppression use . Participants consent allow medical information collect and/or provide blood tissue sample . Patients see Infectious Disease/Transplant team ask provide write informed consent allow past , current future identifiable medical record information relate condition place research database . The medical record information place database relate directly patients'-participants ' disease process . However , since concurrent medical condition treatment ( i.e. , relate directly transplantation ) may impact substantially patients'-participants ' condition , likely patients'-participants ' past , current future identifiable medical record information place research database . Consent obtain pre-transplant period . The advantage system consent obtain directly patient ( rather proxy , would necessary situation consent obtain post-transplant ) . Secondly , since time transplantation predict certainty may occur hour research coordinator work , consent prior transplantation ensures entire post-transplant period cover consent . This would ensure early post-transplant infection miss , thereby eliminate form systematic bias . The disadvantage system patient undergo informed consent subsequently undergo transplantation . Additionally , occasional patient present acute organ system failure ( example , patient fulminant hepatic failure ) undergo pre-transplant consent . We attempt minimize risk pre-study subsequent meeting transplant surgeon ensure study team inform patient timely basis . Participant medical information store electronically within research data base . The name , social security number , medical record number participant delete stored medical information replace linkage code . Access participant medical information contain within research database restrict research investigator research staff.. Information link linkage code participant ' name , social security number medical record number store secure location separate medical information . Access information link linkage code participant name , social security number medical record number grant Principal Investigator research coordinator research database . Participant medical record information store research database indefinite period time . The participant follow four year transplantation . Epidemiologic information collect At baseline ( upon sign informed consent ) , follow information collect : Demographic data - age , sex , state birth , prior travel area endemic histoplasmosis , coccidioidomycosis blastomycosis , indication listing transplantation , prior medical problem , prior chemotherapy/immunosuppressive therapy prior fungal infection . During first week post transplant , follow information collect : Type date transplant , UNOS status , pre-transplant conditioning thymoglobulin alemtuzumab , ongoing immunosuppressive regimen . At time fungal infection , follow information collect - symptom sign infection duration , receipt antifungal prophylaxis , presence indwell vascular device , duration neutropenia , presence graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) severity treatment , history graft rejection treatment Six week follow fungal infection , follow information collect - treatment infection , outcome ( include duration hospitalization , fate organ graft mortality ) Blood work collect A separate consent form present blood work . This ensure patient decline blood work specifically study still opportunity epidemiologic information collect . The following test collect specifically study . - CD4 lymphocyte count pre-transplant every three month post-transplant - Blood Cylex assay pre-transplant per month X18 month - Blood storage ( see ) * Additionally , bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collect ( see schedule ) *Blood storage collect patient high risk invasive fungal infection ( 4 , 11 , 42 , 43 ) . These patient : - Lung transplant recipient - Intestinal transplant recipient - Kidney/pancreas transplant recipient - Liver transplant recipient renal replacement therapy require re-transplantation first week post-transplantation The BAL sample collect subject undergoes clinically indicate bronchoscopy excess BAL fluid collect study . Mycologic sample All fungi grown routine clinical specimen patient study saved clinical microbiology laboratory . They make available Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) - researcher work conjunction CDC may also examine isolates mechanisms antifungal resistance mechanism pathogenicity . No patient identifier would provide either CDC researcher . Only relevant `` de-identified '' clinical information ( eg , prior use specific antifungal agent ) would provide .</detailed_description>
