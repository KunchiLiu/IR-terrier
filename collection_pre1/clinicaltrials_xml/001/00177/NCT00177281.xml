	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate new anti-cancer drug call S CKD602 , develop ALZA Corporation . The drug investigational approve Food Drug administration ( FDA ) . The side effect ( way drug act body ) effect disease study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study S-CKD602 Patients With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose study : To determine maximum tolerate dose ( high dose safely give subject ) S CKD602 give every three week . To determine incidence severity toxicity ( side-effects ) S CKD602 give every three week . To determine subject 's body handle drug ( pharmacokinetics ) follow administration S CKD602 . In addition , would also like analyze gene ( material inside cell responsible cell function appearance ) find subject 's blood affect study drug S-CKD602 broken subject 's body . This process refer `` metabolic genotyping analysis '' . This evaluation perform use blood sample optional .</detailed_description>
