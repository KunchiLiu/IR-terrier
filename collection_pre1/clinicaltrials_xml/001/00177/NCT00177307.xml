	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Using Bevacizumab , Capecitabine Oxaliplatin Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ongoing clinical trial evaluate addition bevacizumab standard chemotherapeutic regimen colorectal cancer FOLFOX FOLFIRI . In study addition bevacizumab safe result significantly increase toxicity . Our propose regimen advantage easily administer outpatient setting , potential enhance activity need evaluate clinical trial . The pattern care CRC shift , IFL previously standard care , proven inferior regimen compare FOLFOX4 . ( 8 ) The recent FDA approval February 2004 bevacizumab first line therapy , state bevacizumab approve agent combination 5-FU regimen , give clear guideline `` best regimen '' . This issue need evaluate rapidly clinical trial , clear combination 5-FU capecitabine oxaliplatin bevacizumab one active well-tolerated regimen . The optimum sequence , schedule dos need determine clinical trial .</detailed_description>
