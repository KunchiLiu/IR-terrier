	<brief_summary>This phase II , open-label trial Gefitinib docetaxel patient one prior regimen chemotherapy metastatic pancreatic carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Gefitinib Docetaxel Salvage Therapy Advanced Pancreatic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial therapy metastatic pancreatic carcinoma inadequate , effective second line therapy . Docetaxel know single agent activity pancreatic carcinoma , result median survival 5.9 month , similar gemcitabine , assess Phase II study ( 10 ) pancreatic tumor know express EGFR . We propose combination docetaxel Gefitinib activity pancreatic carcinoma , whether regimen administer first second-line therapy metastatic disease . Given toxicity profile agent , believe well-tolerated regimen . In fact , preliminary analysis phase II study docetaxel Gefitinib identical regimen non-small cell lung cancer patient show regimen safe active .</detailed_description>
