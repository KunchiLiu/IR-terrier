	<brief_title>Whey Protein Concentrate 40 % Made Milk Immunized Cows Aid Prevention Relapse Clostridium Difficile-Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , prospective , control , randomize , open-label study . Sixty subject randomize 2:1 receive MucoMilk® ( n=40 ) control arm specific product intervention ( n=20 ) . There effective FDA-approved treatment prevent recurrence CDAD withhold subject randomize control arm . The sponsor prepare sequentially numbered batch MucoMilk® entire 2-week dosing period , 42 packet , prepare randomization table hold confidence University Pittsburgh Investigational Drug Service ( IDS ) pharmacist . Each subject assign sequential study number ( i.e . 1 , 2 , 3 , etc . ) enrol study . Upon enrollment , research staff contact IDS pharmacist obtain subject 's study number randomization assignment ( MucoMilk® specific product intervention ) . Research staff access randomization table . Subjects assign receive MucoMilk® give box contain 14 leaflet numbered `` Day 1 '' `` Day 14 '' . Each leaflet consist 3 packet label `` morning '' , `` noon '' , `` evening '' connect perforated paper . Subjects provide one box instruct alter diet two-week course . At University Pittsburgh , anticipate 150 subject need screen order enter 60 subject study . Subjects may participate study 63 day . Subjects manage follow per institutional infection control guideline C. difficile containment regardless assign study group . Subjects receive appropriate treatment comorbid condition base judgement treat physician practice guideline . With exception investigational agent , clinically indicate concomitant medication symptomatic relief support allow upon recommendation approval investigator . For trial , safety MucoMilk® determine passive self-reporting subject diary active surveillance preset interview adverse event . In addition , physical exam extensive hematologic biochemical testing perform MucoMilk® administration . Efficacy examine assess CDAD relapse rate . A relapse CDAD reach , comparison day , stool become looser either ( 1 ) frequency stool increase 2 consecutive day , ( 2 ) single day frequency increase &gt; 3 stool , ( 3 ) occurrence &gt; 6 stools/day day . In respect , CDAD relapse define `` probable '' occur describe first 18 day follow MucoMilk® initiation negative C. diff toxin assay `` proven '' occur time positive C. diff toxin assay . A subject consider treatment failure s/he meet criteria CDAD relapse . Subjects include study ask follow 60 day off-study adverse reaction ( ) CDAD relapse per subject diary documentation . These subject may receive treatment CDAD outside study standard care offer study product intervention randomization . 3.3 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations : Subjects may either inpatient outpatient participation study . Inpatient study visit take place UPMC Presbyterian , UPMC Montefiore , UPMC Shadyside . Outpatient study visit take place Infectious Disease Clinic Falk Medical Building . Each study visit last one hour depend procedure do visit . All procedure perform study research-required exception antibiotic treatment CDAD initiate Diagnosis Visit stool toxin assay perform confirm suspect CDAD relapse standard care CDAD . The investigator review result evaluation , result become part subject 's research record . It may necessary subject make additional visit ( ) participation study study procedure list repeated event unforeseen unanticipated abnormal result ; difficulty sample shipping , processing , test ; and/or subject experience change his/her physical condition . Screening Procedures : Screening Visit subject occur within 3 day prior Day 1 combine Day 1 Visit subject may randomize currently receive complete standard antibiotic therapy CDAD . Subjects ask read sign inform consent study procedure perform . Evaluations do visit include : - Complete physical examination . - Collection demographic data , medication history , chronic health score , primary/relapse CDAD episode information . - Female subject childbearing potential give urine pregnancy test , must negative . Subjects currently standard antibiotic course CDAD oral/intravenous metronidazole and/or vancomycin continue therapy minimum 10 day per standard care discretion study physician . Experimental Procedures : Day 1 Visit occur within 3 day Screening . If diarrhea recur CDAD relapse suspect , stool sample toxin assay ELISA/cell test , culture , microscopy . If positive CDAD , subject take study follow per standard care CDAD relapse . Evaluations include : - Karnofsky EORTC GI score . - 45ml blood draw hematology ( Hgb , WBC w/diff , platelet ) , renal function ( creatinine , urea , electrolyte ) , liver function ( ALT , AST , alkaline phosphatase , albumin , glucose , total protein , bilirubin ) , lipid , IgE , storage . - Female subject childbearing potential give urine pregnancy test , must negative . - Distribution subject diary recording adverse event ( ) number consistency stool . At completion evaluation , MucoMilk® subject receive enough study product entire 14-day dosing period , counsel proper storage administration study staff , give study agent diary record compliance . Day 7 9 Visit conduct telephone outpatient visit inpatient review stool frequency consistency perceive adverse event MucoMilk® , applicable . If CDAD relapse suspect base review , subject ask provide stool sample toxin assay . If positive CDAD , subject take MucoMilk® applicable , study , follow per standard care CDAD relapse . Follow-Up Procedures : Day 18 21 Visit evaluation include : - Targeted physical exam . - Karnofsky EORTC GI score . - 45ml blood draw hematology , renal liver function test , lipid , IgE , storage . - If diarrhea recur CDAD relapse suspect , stool sample toxin assay ELISA/cell test , culture , microscopy . - Collection unused investigational product study agent diary . - Subject diary review . Subjects continue record adverse event ( ) number consistency stool follow-up period . Through Day 60 weekly visit conduct telephone visit review bowel movement stool consistency . If CDAD relapse suspect base review , subject ask provide stool sample toxin assay . If positive CDAD , subject take study follow per standard care CDAD relapse . The occurrence time occurrence new relapse period evaluate well . Subjects complete study Day 60 relapse CDAD ask return diary , discharge study participation , refer back primary care physician follow-up . 3.4 Storage Biological Samples : During study , serum sample collect Day 1 Day 18 21 label subject 's study identification number date collect ; process ; frozen ; store MucoVax future test part study , include investigation antibody direct C. difficile toxin . Also , presence human antibody direct bovine immunoglobulin may examine . The sponsor sole control sample , store indefinite period time . Subjects notify result future study information collect apply management disease time test do . If sample provide secondary investigator , sample , devoid subject identifier render anonymous , obtain sponsor secondary investigator . The secondary investigator direct access subject identifier related subject information .</detailed_description>
