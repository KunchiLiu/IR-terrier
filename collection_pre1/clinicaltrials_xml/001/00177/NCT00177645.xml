	<detailed_description>There evidence people CF may differences liquid line surface lung people without CF . There two thing know different . One call bicarbonate secretion , movement salt call bicarbonate normally present blood lung fluid people . The abnormal movement bicarbonate appear cause second abnormality - liquid breathe tube acid liquid patient without CF . These difference may affect stickiness thickness mucus limit well hairs line breathe tube ( cilium ) move mucus lung . Recent study group patient chronic cough look effect give inhaled bicarbonate solution ( sodium bicarbonate instead sodium chloride ) study subject ' ability cough mucus . Compared group give inhaled saline , patient give inhaled bicarbonate able cough approximately three time much mucus . No clinical study look whether inhaled bicarbonate improve ability lung person CF move mucus lung treatment affect lung function patient CF .</detailed_description>
