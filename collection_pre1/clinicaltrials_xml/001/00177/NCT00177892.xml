	<brief_summary>The purpose study define mechanism ( ) Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Hypopnea ( OSAH ) promote abnormal metabolic process characterize metabolic syndrome . The investigator hypothesize sleep fragmentation intermittent sleep hypoxia occur OSAH patient promote oxidative stress inflammation turn lead insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , abnormal vascular reactivity process consistent metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) Metabolic Syndrome : Role Oxidative Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome define insulin resistance , central obesity , systemic hypertension dyslipidemia associate increase cardiovascular ( CV ) risk . Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea ( OSAH ) also associate increase CV risk insulin resistance . Since OSAH associate oxidative stress pro-inflammatory process , associate insulin resistance , follow oxidative stress inflammation may mediate linkage OSAH , insulin resistance ultimately , metabolic syndrome . The overall goal research test hypothesis oxidative stress inflammation link OSAH insulin resistance well CV risk-promoting condition reflect metabolic syndrome ( e.g . hyperlipidemia ) . We specifically test individual sleep consequence OSAH , include sleep fragmentation intermittent sleep hypoxia , promote oxidative stress inflammation turn promote insulin resistance feature metabolic syndrome . Aim 1a : To determine effect sleep fragmentation oxidative stress inflammation feature metabolic syndrome include insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , obesity , hypertension . Aim 1b : To assess interaction pre-existing metabolic syndrome overweight condition without metabolic syndrome , regard effect sleep fragmentation study variable , contrast effect experimentally-induced sleep fragmentation non-OSAH/overweight individual metabolic syndrome , non-OSAH/overweight individual without metabolic syndrome control group non-OSAH/normal weight without metabolic syndrome . Aim : 2 : To evaluate effect intermittent sleep hypoxia oxidative stress inflammation explore relationship two process insulin resistance , lipid profile , heart period variability plasma cortisol . Aim : 3 : Using microarray data peripheral monocyte , explore specific gene expression pattern study condition associate alteration consistent metabolic syndrome . Aim : 4 : This exploratory aim collect preliminary data regard correlation among genetic variation ( polymorphism ) , gene expression pattern ( microarray ) resultant protein production ( proteomics ) . These data use hypothesis development .</detailed_description>
