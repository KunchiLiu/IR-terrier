	<detailed_description>While therapeutic exercise improve mobility balance appear improve physical performance may reduce fall , less known responsiveness specific intervention relation response intervention underlie problem impairment . Therapeutic approach improve mobility reduce fall risk heterogeneous , consistently focus problem solve method enhance motor control skill , approach find important motor learn animal model . This two-year pilot study allow u compare clinical , psychological laboratory outcome motor-learning base impairment-targeted exercise intervention improve walk old adult . All subject participate pre post intervention test 12 week exercise intervention gait involve either motor learning ( skill enhancement ) impairment-targeted ( low extremity strengthening , flexibility gait cue ) .</detailed_description>

Difficulty walk balance indicate follow two criterion baseline testing : mild moderate slow walk speed ( walk speed ≥ .6m/s ≤ 1.0m/s ) , gait variability ( step length coefficient variability , CV &gt; 4.5 % , step width CV &lt; 7 % &gt; 30 % )</criteria>
