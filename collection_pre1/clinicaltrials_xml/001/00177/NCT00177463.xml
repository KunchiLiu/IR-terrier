	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : It hypothesis L-carnosine treatment person bipolar illness improve cognitive outcome , specifically , measure attention executive function , verbal visuospatial memory psychomotor performance , relative placebo treatment . We also hypothesize L-carnosine treatment may secondarily improve residual affective symptom . RESEARCH PLAN : We aim test hypothesis conduct randomize , placebo control , add treatment trial L-carnosine ( add ongoing prescribed pharmacological treatment , example - lithium , anticonvulsant , antipsychotic agent depressant ) period 12 week . Measures cognition , psychopathology utilized evaluate primary secondary outcome , along safety assessment . METHODS : Up 48 subject DSM IV TR bipolar I disorder recruited Western Psychiatric Institute Clinic , Mayview State Hospital Mon Yough Community Services , Inc. use 1:1 randomization , subject sign informed consent document randomize receive L-carnosine placebo . It expect 12 48 subject may meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , leave 36 consent adult ( 18 65 year ) DSM IV-TR Bipolar Disorder assess euthymia ( Young Mania Rating Scale Score ≤ 10 , Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale Score ≤ 10 ) one month period ( 2 assessment ) receive stable dos current medication . They also assess cognitive dysfunction ( attention/executive function , immediate declarative memory , psychomotor performance ) use Cogtest - proprietary neuropsychological library 19 test . These subject characterize normal pre-morbid IQ , ECT treatment past 6 month , alcohol substance dependence past 6 month , mini-mental state score ≥ 24 . L-carnosine ( placebo ) administer use random assignment dose 500 mg/day , increase week 500 mg dose 2000 mg/day ( twice daily schedule ) 4 week ; adjunct exist psychotropic medicine . The dose 2000 mg ( less , i.e . minimum 500 mg tolerability issue ) continue 8 additional week . L-carnosine known interaction psychotropic drug mood-stabilizer level monitor . Standard psychopathology rating scale administer evaluate secondary aim impact residual symptom bipolar disorder . Safety assess tail careful medical history physical examination screen evaluate result laboratory measure . Any adverse effect assess ask question visit , require bring subject assessment outside scheduled visit , telephone contact longer schedule visit . SIGNIFICANCE : Cognitive dysfunction seriously hinder improved functional outcome person schizophrenia bipolar disorder . If short term intervention L-carnosine show promise , definitive study use adequate power sample size , long duration conduct . If improvement cognitive problem link improved functional outcome use supplemental treatment , important therapeutic milestone bipolar disorder achieve .</detailed_description>
