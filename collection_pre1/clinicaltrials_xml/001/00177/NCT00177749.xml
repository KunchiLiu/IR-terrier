	<brief_summary>Therapeutic option serious fungal infection limit intrinsic acquire resistance exist antifungal agent . For example , zygomycetes ( Mucor spp . ) intrinsically resistant voriconazole caspofungin . Yet , available therapeutic option , amphotericin , associate significant renal toxicity , even lipid formulation . Posaconazole new antifungal drug , yet Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve , excellent vitro activity intrinsically resistant fungi zygomycetes . The intent trial provide access posaconazole patient serious fungal infection refractory standard antifungal therapy invasive fungal infection currently effective therapy . Secondly , drug also make available patient invasive fungal infection : - experience serious severe toxicity receive standard antifungal therapy ; - pre-existing renal dysfunction precludes use standard antifungal therapy ; - chronically immunosuppressed history invasive fungal infection previously treat posaconazole clinical trial , require oral antifungal suppressive therapy maintenance treatment prevent recurrence . This multicenter , open-label , non-comparative experimental treatment use protocol . The experimental treatment use protocol provide investigational medication posaconazole drug commercially available . Posaconazole give orally enterally administer suspension . The duration therapy discretion investigator . Safety assessment include electrocardiogram [ ECG ] ( ensure QTc interval prolongation ) perform baseline serum/urine pregnancy test perform baseline every three month initiation therapy . Plasma concentration obtain evidence clinical failure . No test perform specifically experimental treatment use protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Limited Access Protocol Posaconazole Invasive Fungal Infections Study PO2095</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center limited access experimental treatment use protocol Posaconazole treatment Invasive Fungal Infections . This experimental treatment use protocol project begin enrollment September 2001 . Screening : 1. complete medical history , include review subject 's fungal infection antifungal treatment ( ) 2. woman childbearing potential , serum ( blood ) urine pregnancy test experimental medication ( posaconazole ) administer . This test require sample blood drawn ( 10 mL 1 tablespoon blood 10 ml 1 tablespoon urine ) . The subject able participate experimental treatment use protocol pregnant . In addition , participate experimental treatment use protocol , woman childbearing potential , serum ( blood ) urine pregnancy test perform every 3 month . 3 . Electrocardiogram- ECG The total time screen test one hour carry subject 's hospital room . Experimental Procedures : follow procedure part subject 's standard medical care . This experimental treatment use protocol conduct worldwide . This experimental treatment use protocol open end set subject enrollment set Schering Plough . It anticipate site may open single patient , anticipate enrol two patient UPMC . All subject enrol open-label experimental treatment use protocol receive treatment posaconazole outline previously . Subject identification number assign sequentially within site start Subject No . 1 . There randomization . Primary efficacy endpoint global response ( microbiological clinical ) end therapy . Review Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria , Medical/Disease History perform Baseline . A standard 12-lead ECG perform Baseline Visit within one week prior treatment , one month initiation treatment . ECG repeat QTc &gt; 450 msec men &gt; 470 msec woman , new cardiac sign symptom clinically indicate . Apart ECG pregnancy test , laboratory test perform solely experimental treatment use protocol . Laboratory abnormality represent clinically significant change baseline value ( ie , change one toxicity grade ) time experimental treatment use protocol period ( active treatment follow-up ) , clinical manifestation , require intervention consider adverse event report sponsor ) . Baseline evaluation perform within 72 hour prior start investigational medication . The investigational medication ( posaconazole ) dispense upon completion Baseline assessment confirmation Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria meet . Posaconazole supply suspension 40 mg/mL ( 105 mL/bottle ) . For seriously ill patient , posaconazole initially administer dose 200 mg four time daily ( QID ) orally/enterally meal nutritional supplement , stable regimen may change 400 mg orally/enterally twice daily ( BID ) . ( Changes dose regimen discretion investigator , base clinical state patient . ) Stable , ambulatory patient may start 400 mg PO BID . For subject receive enteral feeding , medication administer every six hour ( QID ) every 12 hour ( BID ) indicate . Duration Treatment : The investigator use discretion determine appropriate duration therapy individual subject . Duration base following : clinical diagnosis invasive fungal infection ; causative fungal pathogen ; severity invasive fungal infection ; severity subject 's underlying disease ; recovery immune suppression ; rapidity clinical response . When subject discharge hospital , participant give supply investigational medication ( posaconazole ) , adequate last next doctor 's visit . Re-supply posaconazole provide regular interval long subject completes schedule doctor visit continue comply take posaconazole request , receive maximum potential effect experimental medication . The experimental medication take full meal order well absorbed blood stream . If medication well absorbed , may less effective . The experimental treatment use protocol physician examine subject regular schedule clinical visit experimental treatment use protocol , determine well subject respond evaluate well subject tolerate Posaconazole ( SCH 56592 ) . No extra visit require experimental treatment protocol . Specially trained pharmacist UPMC prepare investigational medication . The medication supply UPMC hospital Pharmacy give participant nursing staff participant hospital care-giver , family member , spouse , adult child , family member adult person responsible caring subject , discharge hospital . Participation experimental treatment protocol continue sign symptom resolve ongoing therapy longer require maximum 24 month , posaconazole ( experimental medication ) become commercially available ( approved FDA ) . The maximum length time subject investigational medication depend type severity fungal infection , response investigational medication discretion experimental treatment protocol doctor . For patient complete response , posaconazole may discontinue seven day resolution sign symptoms infection . Subjects Candida infection bloodstream , disseminated/metastatic ( deep organ ) hepatosplenic candidiasis endocarditis treat posaconazole minimum 14 day least seven day resolution symptom . The experimental treatment use protocol carry UPMC-Presbyterian hospital . Subjects see monthly 30 day last dose investigational medication determine well subject respond investigational medication .</detailed_description>

In case long term parenteral antifungal therapy ( e.g. , amphotericin B echinocandins ) consider practical clinically reasonable physician , posaconazole may consider potential treatment option . Patients debilitate immediately life threaten fungal disease , significant morbidity may result disability prior antifungal therapy unsuccessful ( e.g. , chronic candidiasis dehydration malnutrition , cutaneous phaeohyphomycosis mycetoma ) . Females pregnant continue breast feed infant . History serious severe hypersensitivity idiosyncratic reaction azole antifungal Subjects require ongoing treatment prohibit medication appropriate washout period elapse .
