	<brief_title>Prevention Osteoporosis Men With Prostate Cancer Androgen Deprivation Therapy ( POP Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While osteoporosis woman recognize major public health problem , osteoporosis men also profound clinical impact . Men age 75 sustain hip fracture high mortality woman age ( 30 % versus 9 % ) . Hip fracture men account one-third hip fracture . In 1995 , male osteoporosis account $ 2.7 billion health care cost -- nearly one-third overall cost osteoporosis . Alendronate show improve bone mass decrease vertebral fracture men osteoporosis . Prostate cancer common visceral malignancy second lead cause death American men . Almost men progress late stage disease treat androgen deprivation therapy life , result 5-fold increase risk hip fracture 13-fold increase risk osteoporosis fracture . Several study suggest merit induce androgen deprivation much early course therapy prostate cancer . It therefore quite likely androgen deprivation strategy employ increase frequency patient less advanced disease , result long life expectancy great bone loss .</detailed_description>
