	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Based available neuroscience human data , hypothesize supplemental L-carnosine treatment ( potent naturally occur antioxidant anti-glycation agent ) useful disease modifying agent use adjunctively antipsychotic drug patient diagnosis either schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . More specifically , hypothesis oral L-carnosine treatment ( compare placebo ) enhance cognitive ability ( specifically : measure attention , executive function , work memory , visuospatial ability language ) person schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . Secondarily , hypothesize secondary improvement positive , negative mood symptom L-carnosine treatment . RESEARCH PLAN : A randomized , placebo control , add-on treatment trial L-carnosine ( add exist antipsychotic treatment ) period 16 week . Measures cognition , psychopathology utilized evaluate primary secondary outcome , along safety assessment . METHODS : Up eighty-four subject DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder recruit Western Psychiatric Institute Clinic , Mayview State Hospital , Mon Yough Community Services , Inc. Dubois Regional Medical Center use 1:1 randomization , subject sign informed consent document randomize receive L-carnosine placebo . During 4 week titration period , L-carnosine dosage increase 500 2000 mg/day , continue additional 8 week . If side-effects note , minimum 500 mg/day L-carnosine use . A computerized cognitive battery form main efficacy measure administer baseline visit 6 ( i.e . prior 4 week taper ) ; measure administer visit 4 ( 28 day ) . Standard psychopathology rating scale administer evaluate secondary aim impact positive negative symptom schizophrenia . Safety assess tail careful medical history physical examination screen evaluate result laboratory measure . Any adverse effect assess ask question visit , require bringing subject assessment outside scheduled visit . SIGNIFICANCE : Cognitive dysfunction person schizophrenia serious limitation achieve significantly well functional outcome ( Green , et . al. , 1996 ) . Till recently , therapeutic nihilism prevail come treatment improve cognitive ability schizophrenia . One reason pessimistic view cognitive dysfunction consider malleable treatment instead think represent unchanging dimension illness . However , view changing , psychosocial cognitive remediation technique evaluate treat cognitive dysfunction schizophrenia . A recent synthesis data would suggest mediator well cognitive outcome may also include agent target inefficient antioxidant defense person schizophrenia , counter NMDA-glutamate neuronal excitotoxicity ( Yao et al. , 2001 ) . These mechanism may underlie neuronal membrane pathology schizophrenia , turn abnormality may contribute cognitive dysfunction decline report course illness . The benefit L-carnosine ( naturally occur antioxidant anti-glycation agent ) improve cognitive ability social behavior communicative skill report random-assignment , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial child adolescents autism ; specifically improvement receptive language score socialization communication skill score ( Chez et al. , 2002a ) . The primary focus study evaluate ability L-carnosine , naturally occur dipeptide , enhance cognitive ability people schizophrenia . The study also evaluate whether L-carnosine secondary benefit positive negative mood symptom . As relatively benign agent , L-carnosine offer potential achieve significant clinical impact improve cognitive dysfunction person schizophrenia , efficacy confirm .</detailed_description>
