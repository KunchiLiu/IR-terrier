	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Carotid Artery Stenting With Without Cerebral Protection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single center , prospective , randomized trial evaluate safety effectiveness CAS without CP . The study population comprise subject atherosclerotic , post endarterectomy restenotic obstructive lesion native carotid artery . Other carotid artery pathology amenable surgical repair ( example carotid artery dissection ) also consider . Subjects high risk complication standard CEA target population study . High risk status confirm two physician , one vascular surgeon . Both symptomatic asymptomatic subject enrol . This ensure proportion symptomatic subject two arm study . `` Symptomatic '' define exclusion criterion . The expected duration clinical trial 3 year . In study two arm subject may randomize : Group1 : CAS use RX ACCUNET Group 2 : CAS without use RX ACCUNET This study design test whether addition CP enhance safety effectiveness CAS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To participate study , subject MUST follow inclusion study : • The subject ( male nonpregnant female ) must &gt; 18 year age . • The subject stenosis common internal carotid artery least 70 % determine one modality list . • The subject consider relatively high risk carotid endarterectomy . This determination make document two physician , least one must vascular surgeon act investigator trial . High risk consideration include least one following : 1 . Cardiac dysfunction . NYHA class III , compensate active congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , incomplete coronary revascularization , ejection fraction &lt; 35 % , pulmonary hypertension , recommendation cardiologist open CEA . 2 . Pulmonary dysfunction , history respiratory failure , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) bronchodilator recommendation pulmonary specialist open CEA . 3 . Multisystem dysfunction , define combination medical problem three distinct system . 4 . Anatomic issue : previous CEA neck dissection , neck irradiation , inaccessible lesion , neck fusion anatomic consideration increase risk CEA . 5 . Age &gt; 80 AND symptomatic ( define ) 6 . General debilitation document subject 's primary physician . 7 . Increased anesthetic risk document anesthesiologist . Subjects either clinically symptomatic asymptomatic ( less 80 year age ) . Symptomatic subject experience event within previous 120 day ipsilateral carotid artery distribution . The event classify either 1 ) one TIAs , characterize distinct focal neurologic dysfunction monocular blindness clearing sign symptom within 24 hour , 2 ) one complete stroke ( define protocol ) persistence symptom sign 24 hour ( recent event use qualify event ) . **Patients major nonhemorrhagic stroke include clinical status stable 5 day ( base exam perform neurologist participate CoInvestigator trial ) . If angiogram perform qualify subject , recent feasible acceptable do &gt; 120 day study entry . Angiograms institution acceptable . Other noninvasive qualify image modality include : 1 . Duplex ultrasound ( DU ) perform UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside hospital . 2 . Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) perform UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside hospital . 3 . Computed Tomographic Angiography ( CTA ) perform UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside hospital . The degree stenosis noninvasive study confirm predeployment diagnostic angiography prior proceed stent deployment . However , two noninvasive study list report stenosis &gt; 70 % , AND predeployment angiogram reveals 50 70 % stenosis , patient randomize entered trial angiogram occasion underestimate stenosis . Female subject childbearing potential must document negative pregnancy test index hospitalization . The subject must sign write informed consent , prior procedure , use form approve local Institutional Review Board Medical Ethics Committee . If patient 's creatinine 3.5 great , nephrologist must clear participate trial . To participate study , subject may NOT HAVE follow enrollment study : The subject intracranial hemorrhage , hemorrhagic stroke , stroke mass effect demonstrate CT scan MRI within 30 day index procedure . The subject persisting ischemic stroke ( define either score &gt; 15 NIH stroke scale , Rankin score &gt; 3 Barthel score &lt; 60 measure within one week prior study entry ) . The subject intracranial mass lesion ( i.e. , abscess , tumor , infection ) . The subject know allergy heparin , ticlopidine clopidogrel metal use stent . There visual angiographic evidence intraluminal thrombus think increase risk plaque fragmentation distal embolization . The subject peripheral vascular , supraaortic internal carotid artery tortuosity preclude use catheterbased technique require successful result . The subject , female , positive pregnancy test . The subject arteriovenous malformation territory target carotid artery . Subjects highly calcified lesion resistant predilation PTA The subject unstable angina ( defined Class IV rest ) , evolve MI recent MI ( within 14 day ) . The subject condition precludes adequate local hemostasis . Patients candidate MRI scanning ( pacemaker , etc ) .</criteria>
