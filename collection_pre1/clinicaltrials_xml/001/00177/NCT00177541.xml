	<brief_title>Further Enhancing Non-pharmacologic Therapy Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary incontinence ( UI ) prevalent morbid elderly , associate cost exceed $ 26 billion annually . Although effective therapy exists , underutilized . This particularly true non-pharmacologic therapy , least effective drug safer , recommend initial approach every national panel . If therapy biofeedback ( target pelvic muscle detrusor suppression ) become widely use , require simplification , few briefer session , less expensive equipment , less sophisticated therapist . Unfortunately , protocol yet devise unknown component essential . We postulate mechanism mediate effectiveness identify knowledge make possible enhance efficacy formulate feasible cost-effective protocol . Since reduction UI correlate weakly improve quality life , however , important biofeedback 's impact life quality assess concomitantly ensure formulation streamline method eliminate component essential improve quality life , even physiological correlate . We address issue treat least 150 elderly subject urge UI 8-week course biofeedback . We collect clinical quality life data perform extensive physiologic test subject baseline 8 week later . Improvement correlate change physiologic quality life parameter identify parameter likely mediate . Knowledge study identify predictor mechanisms mediate success biofeedback ; suggest way could improve ; facilitate development less expensive , quicker , feasible protocol deliver ( potentially permit application le motivated cognitively impaired patient ) ; shed insight mechanism may even improve efficacy intervention .</detailed_description>
