	<brief_title>Characteristics Sleep Patterns Young Adults With Without Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall aim research study compare symptom , experience laboratory sleep characteristic young adult without insomnia . Insomnia pattern difficulty fall asleep , stay asleep feeling poorly rest despite adequate amount time sleep , occur nearly every night one month longer . For insomnia , look effect intervention one two medication ( escitalopram zolpidem ) inactive pill ( placebo ) . This intervention follow re-evaluation symptom , experience laboratory sleep characteristic . The three hypothesis investigate : compare control subject , insomnia demonstrate affective disturbance heighten arousal ; different medication different degree effect two dimension measure ( affective disturbance heighten arousal ) ; PET scan reveal different pattern activity brain group people insomnia . We specifically focus syndrome Primary Insomnia ( PI ) , define DSM-IV insomnia last least one month cause significant impairment distress . PI exclude insomnia occurs exclusively course another sleep , mental , substance-induced , medical disorder . Insomnia significant public health problem prevalence , morbidity , risk pose development subsequent mental disorder , particularly depressive anxiety disorder . Understanding psychobiology primary insomnia critical step toward address question regard relationship mood anxiety disorder . Our model insomnia build two major concept run previous insomnia research , affective disturbance heighten arousal , drive factor sleep-wake disturbance define PI . Implicit model individual PI different degree dysfunction , account heterogeneity clinical symptom . Contemporary theory affect structure suggest two dimension may orthogonal pure form , nevertheless related clinical condition characterize mixed anxiety-depression , PI . Measures affective disturbance arousal study include questionnaire , diary-based assessment , physiological measure . Pharmacological treatment probe may help distinguish role affective disturbance heighten arousal insomnia . We use benzodiazepine receptor agonist ( BzRA ) , zolpidem , antidepressant , escitalopram . BzRA potentiate effect GABA ( 1 ) , minimal direct activity receptor type . They efficacious treatment insomnia ( 2-4 ) , little effect mood . We choose zolpidem relatively specific hypnotic versus anxiolytic action ( 5 ) , widely-prescribed BzRA hypnotic , well-tolerated ( 6 ) . Clinically-effective dos even `` nonsedating '' antidepressant also improve symptom PI ( 7 ) , suggest direct sedation mechanism improve insomnia . We choose escitalopram neither strongly alert sedate clinical polysomnographic study . This `` sleep-neutral '' profile allow u use effect affective disturbance , rather nonspecific sedate property . Escitalopram 's specific effect serotonin reuptake blockade lack affinity Bz receptor distinguish zolpidem pharmacologic probe . Functional neuroimaging study wakefulness sleep may also help identify substrate affective disturbance heighten arousal insomnia . Affective disturbance form MDD associate alteration regional deactivation pattern NREM sleep , regional activation pattern REM sleep . These observation suggest sleep-wake functional neuroimaging paradigm insomnia patient , conjunction behavioral measure , may help identify brain system mediate heighten arousal affective disturbance , system interact .</detailed_description>
