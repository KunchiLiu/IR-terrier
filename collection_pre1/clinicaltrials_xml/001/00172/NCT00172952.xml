	<brief_title>The Role SNP ECM MMP Development Pathological High Myopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High myopia ( pathological myopia ) cause excessive axial elongation primarily involve ora-equatorial area posterior pole . Pathological myopia often accompany glaucoma , cataract , macular degeneration , retinal detachment , lead blindness damage retina extremely severe . Population family study Chinese provide evidence geneticcomponent pathologic myopia . Children myopic parent likely myopia child nonmyopic parent . Therefore , possible search potential candidate gene myopia genomic study pathological myopia . The retina receive signal retina-RPE complex affect growth scleral coat . The change scleral component , collagen fibril proteoglycans , note experimental human myopia induce pathology high myopia . It interest know individual difference SNP component scleral coat affect response signal retina-RPE complex . The important effector scleral coat collagen , proteoglycans , MMPs TIMPs . Therefore , difference SNPs different gene might contribute formation scleral thin myopia development . In project , focus subject use GenomeLab SNPstream Genotyping System powerful helpful identify specific SNPs regard .</detailed_description>
