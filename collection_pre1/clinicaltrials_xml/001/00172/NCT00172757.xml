	<brief_summary>We explore genetic ( include APC , k-ras , p53 , MSI , etc . ) environmental ( include family history , life style , diet , nutritional status , DM , serum IGF-I , IGFBP-3 , etc . ) risk factor colorectal tumorigenesis . We accrue approximately 1000 patient experimental group . The control group consist 2000 individual confirm without colorectal cancer polyp colonoscopy . We estimate statistical power study reach 90 % . In second year , explore association various environmental risk factor epigenetic change various oncogene tumor suppressor gene . Firstly , study correlation hypermethylation promoter region hMLH1 gene various environmental factor . Next , explore genetic polymorphism promoter E-cadherin gene . Recently , report C→A genetic polymorphism promoter region E-cadherin gene prostate cancer . Since phenomenon report colorectal cancer , mandatory u extend research E-cadherin polymorphism colorectal cancer . Moreover , project focus exploration association genetic polymorphism promoter TS gene chemosensitivity 5-Fu-based therapy . We speculate good prognosis colorectal tumor MSI related expression TS gene . In summary , second year project extend accumulate experience study genetic polymorphism clarify association genetic polymorphism TS gene prognosis colorectal cancer chemotherapy . We believe project facilitate : ( 1 ) clarification colorectal cancer tumorigenesis ; ( 2 ) establishment domestic epidemiological data colorectal cancer Taiwan , ( 3 ) improvement quality clinical management patient colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This two-year hospital-based case control study . In fist year , set solid database laboratory regard molecular genetics colorectal cancer . We explore genetic ( include APC , k-ras , p53 , MSI , etc . ) environmental ( include family history , life style , diet , nutritional status , DM , serum IGF-I , IGFBP-3 , etc . ) risk factor colorectal tumorigenesis . During whole 2-year period project , accrue approximately 1000 patient experimental group . The control group consist 2000 individual confirm without colorectal cancer polyp colonoscopy . We estimate statistical power study reach 90 % . In second year , explore association various environmental risk factor epigenetic change various oncogene tumor suppressor gene . It well know epigenetic change various oncogene tumor suppressor gene relate intrinsic extrinsic environmental alteration . Firstly , study correlation hypermethylation promoter region hMLH1 gene various environmental factor . Next , explore genetic polymorphism promoter E-cadherin gene . It well know E-cadherin play major role maintenance cellular structure . Recently , report C→A genetic polymorphism promoter region E-cadherin gene prostate cancer . The experimental method feasible laboratory . Since phenomenon report colorectal cancer , mandatory u extend research E-cadherin polymorphism colorectal cancer . Moreover , project focus exploration association genetic polymorphism promoter TS gene chemosensitivity 5-Fu-based therapy . Recent report indicate colorectal tumor MSI good prognosis . Moreover , author indicate genetic polymorphism TS gene relate chemosensitivity . Therefore , speculate good prognosis colorectal tumor MSI related expression TS gene . In summary , second year project extend accumulate experience study genetic polymorphism clarify association genetic polymorphism TS gene prognosis colorectal cancer chemotherapy . We believe project facilitate : ( 1 ) clarification colorectal cancer tumorigenesis ; ( 2 ) establishment domestic epidemiological data colorectal cancer Taiwan , ( 3 ) improvement quality clinical management patient colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
