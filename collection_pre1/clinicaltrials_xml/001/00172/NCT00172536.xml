	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate change cardiorespiratory fitness leave ventricular function type 2 diabetes uncomplicated coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery . We hypothesize exercise capacity , leave ventricular diastolic function , biochemical data improve 12-wk exercise training patient type 2 diabetes underwent CABG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Exercise Training Left Ventricular Function Type 2 Diabetic Patients Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients type 2 diabetes mellitus high incidence coronary artery disease leave ventricular dysfunction , particularly diastolic dysfunction . Coronary artery bypass surgery know decrease mortality rate diabetes . Further exercise training improve cardiorespiratory fitness control risk factor patient . However , extent improvement mechanism , especially change leave ventricular function , diabetes exercise train fully explore . Subjects assign intervention control group randomization . Subjects intervention group receive 60 % VO2 max moderate aerobic exercise training , twice per week supervision three time per week home , 12 week . All subject receive leave ventricular function test echocardiography impedance cardiography , grade maximal exercise test , biochemical analysis sugar lipid 12 week . Their dietary intake physical activity inquire every 4 week questionnaire .</detailed_description>
