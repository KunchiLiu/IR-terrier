	<brief_summary>Although SLE RA correlate genetic predisposing factor human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) class II , diseases genetic factor might contribute development dysregulated lymphocyte activation autoimmunity . Decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) /TR6 secrete protein belong tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family . It bind Fas ligand ( FasL ) , LIGHT , TL1A TNF family member . It note soluble solid phase DcR3-Fc co-stimulated proliferation , lymphokine production cytotoxicity mouse human T cell upon T-cell receptor ( TCR ) ligation . Recently , investigator find serum level soluble DcR3 high SLE patient healthy control subject ( unpublished data ) .

	<detailed_description>Abnormal immune response permit sustain production pathogenic subset autoantibodies anti-DNA , anti-RNP , anti-RBC , anti-platelet . T cell help critical development full-blown disease ; CD4+ , CD8+ , CD4- , CD8- lymphocytes help autoantibody production SLE . There multiple abnormality permit hyper-activated self-reactive B T cell dominate immune repertoire . Defects cell activation , tolerance , apoptosis , idiotypic network , immune complex clearance generation regulatory cell account . SLE may involve one organ system disease onset may multi-systemic . Rheumatoid inflammation reflex cause persistent stimulation T cell synovial-derived antigen cross-react determinant introduce antecedent exposure foreign antigens infectious agent . Decoy receptor 3 ( DCR3/TR6 ) soluble , secrete factor lack trans-membrane domain . It belong TNFR family capable binding TNF family member FasL , LIGHT TL1A . DcR3/TR6 mRNA express high level lymph node , spleen activate T cell . DcR3/TR6 bind FasL inhibit Fas-FasL interaction FasL-mediated apoptosis lymphocytes several tumor cell line . LIGHT highly express surface activate T lymphocytes macrophage , CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte , granulocytes monocyte thymus several human tumor cell line . LIGHT protein trigger apoptosis several tumor cell express lymphotoxin β receptor ( LTβR ) TR2 . It postulate DcR3/TR6 modulate LIGHT-triggered costimulation via TR2 T cell . Human PBMCs secrete DcR3/TR6 PHA anti-CD3 . The leukocyte aggregation mixed lymphocyte reaction inhibit add soluble form DcR3 . On hand , show DcR3/TR6 , TR2 , LIGHT display complexity interaction . The DcR3/TR6 express solid phase actually transduce reverse , costimulatory signal activate T cell . Soluble DcR3-Fc solid-phase DcR3-Fc found costimulate proliferation , lymphokine production cytotoxicity murine human T cell presence suboptimal TCR ligation . Furthermore , cross link Th1 Th2 cell solid-phase DcR3-Fc along suboptimal concentration anti-CD3 enhanced proliferation Th1 Th2 cell , augment Th1 Th2 cytokine production . These strongly suggest DcR3/TR6 delivers costimulation ligand ( ) T cell , least part costimulation transduce via LIGHT . Recently , find soluble DcR3/TR6 level circulate plasma SLE patient significantly high non-autoimmune control subject . Plate-bound form DcR3 enhance proliferation T cell suboptimal anti-CD3 stimulation normal SLE patient . Addition soluble DcR3-Fc reduce activation-induced cell death T cell subject anti-CD3 re-stimulation ( unpublished data ) . Taken together , raise possibility genetic polymorphism DcR3/TR6 locus might influence expression level function DcR3 , turn implicate dysregulated lymphocyte activation autoimmunity . With aim establish possible correlation DcR3 genetic polymorphism , DcR3 expression , autoimmune phenotype , give proposal . We plan investigate single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) DcR3 gene . The genetic polymorphism DcR3/TR6 gene circulate DcR3 level compare RA , SLE non-autoimmune control subject . The specific aim project follow : 1 . To study allelic distribution DcR3 genetic polymorphism among population Taiwan . 2 . To investigate DcR3 allele correlate serum level DcR3 . 3 . To investigate genetic polymorphism DcR3 gene associate autoimmune disease RA SLE .</detailed_description>
