	<brief_summary>Taiwan endemic region hepatitis B . Before implementation nationwide vaccination program 1984 , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) carrier rate general population 15 20 % .1-2 The major impact hepatitis B ( HB ) infection long-term sequela may include chronic hepatitis , liver cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma.3 Perinatal infection account 40-50 % hepatitis B infection responsible generation-to-generation transmission HB virus.4 Hepatitis B vaccine , plasma derive recombinant , highly immunogenic efficacious.5-10 It report HB vaccine give soon birth able protect infant perinatal infection HB infection become first disease model show mother-to-neonate transmission interrupt effective vaccine.11 Taiwan start national program HB vaccination since 1984 . This program result significant reduction HB carrier rate child age 10 year 9.8 % nationwide vaccination 1.3 % program.12 It also decrease incidence hepatocellular carcinoma child age 6 9 year 0.52 0.13 per 100,000.13 However , duration protection provide HB vaccine proper time booster dose remain unclear . Because HB vaccine subunit protein vaccine , contain HBsAg , limited duration protection anticipate . The result several long-term follow-up study protective efficacy HB vaccination publish . Soon vaccination , protective level antibody ( anti-HBs &gt; 10 mIU/mL ) detect great majority ( 83-99 % ) vaccinees.5-7 The proportion vaccinee protective anti-HBs level decrease 75-87 % 5 year vaccination drop 50 70 % 10-12 year after.10,11,14,15,19-21 Because progressive decline anti-HBs associate increase likelihood development new HBV infection , investigator advise use booster vaccination.20,21 However , preponderance data indicate protective efficacy HB vaccine last least 5 10 year booster 5 year necessary.16-18,22,23 By demonstrate significant augmentation cellular immunity adequate induction protective level antiHBs ( &gt; 10 mIU/ml ) HBsAg HBeAg-positive subject 10 year HB vaccination , also prove protection afford HB vaccination persist less 10 year vaccinees.R Nevertheless , protective efficacy period 10 year remain unknown . Knowledge duration protection HB vaccine optimal timing booster vaccination remain crucial . In study , go examine humoral cellular immunity monitor antibody response follow booster dose HB vaccine group child vaccinate 14 year prior study .</brief_summary>
