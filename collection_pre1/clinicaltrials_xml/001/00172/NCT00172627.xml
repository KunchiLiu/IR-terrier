In experimental study , clarify causal relationship dose- time-dependent experiment COX-2 transient transfection GC cell line . COX-2 act mainly via PGs , like PGE2 . Therefore , also stimulate GC cell exogenous stimulation PGE2 EP receptor 1-4 agonist determine possible way ( ) COX-2 induce IL-6 expression . A selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 various inhibitor PGE2 receptor use well block COX-2 determine signal pathway COX-2 IL-6 . Finally , establish stable COX-2 over-expressing transfectant GC cell control vector transfectant xenograft implantation study mouse . A COX-2 selective agent , celecoxib , administer orally mice tumor block harvest determination IL-6 expression . The present study provide clear understanding role COX-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 GC clinical basic aspect .
