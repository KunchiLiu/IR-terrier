	<brief_title>Molecular Mechanisms Helium-Neon Laser Melanocyte Regeneration Skin Equivalent Vitiligo Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Melanocytes ( MCs ) melanin-producing cell skin derive neural crest cell . Vitiligo vulgaris common depigmentation disorder result destruction functional MCs affect skin . Although disorder affect race occurs approximately 1 % world population , pathogenesis remain obscure . Recovery vitiligo initiate activation , proliferation , migration melanoblast ( MBs ) epidermis . The subsequent maturation MBs lead production melanosomes transfer juxtaposed keratinocytes . The beam low-energy laser produce temperature elevation le 0.5 â„ƒ . Therefore , light-mediated reaction laser irradiation refer biostimulation . Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase consider photoacceptor low-energy laser . Low-energy He-Ne laser numberous clinical application . Our previous study show He-Ne laser irradiation induce repigmentation vitiligo vulgaris . However , exact mechanisms He-Ne laser irradiation repigmentation elucidate thoroughly . In past , demonstrate coexistence antikertinocyte ( anti-KC ) antimelanocyte ( anti-MC ) IgG antibody ( Abs ) vitiligo patient explore potential role vitiligo . This current three-year proposal aim clarify mechanism melanocyte destruction regeneration vitiligo lesion use traditional cell culture skin equivalent model ( organotypic culture ) . In first year , shall focus regeneration MCs MBs He-Ne laser without presence anti-MC IgG antibody vitiligo patient , well involved photodynamic mechanism . Our goal second year investigate regeneration MCs MBs He-Ne laser without presence anti-KC IgG antibody vitiligo patient . In final year project , shall explore effect He-Ne laser combine antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) regeneration MCs MBs . Our result provide information effectiveness He-Ne laser irradiation treat vitiligo .</detailed_description>
