	<brief_summary>Vertebral artery stenosis ( VAS ) decrease posterior brain perfusion , cause vertebrobasilar insufficiency ( VBI ) . It also important embolic source posterior brain . The frequently involve location proximal part vessel , include ostium . Various surgical procedure describe treatment proximal VAS symptom refractory medical therapy , technically difficult high operative mortality morbidity . Endovascular intervention describe alternative surgery . Balloon angioplasty limit elastic recoil dissection . The restenosis rate report literature vary , high 75 % . Stenting offer salvage follow unsuccessful balloon angioplasty , primary stenting show safe effective low restenosis rate . Coronary equipment ideal ostial VAS , consider size artery location lesion . Recently , Albuquerque et al . report relative high restenosis rate longer follow-up duration . Restenosis seem become important issue regard patient â€™ quality life . However , clinical parameter predict restenosis VAS . The purpose study evaluate clinical result series symptomatic ostial VAS treat exclusively tubular balloon expandable coronary stent . We seek identify predictor restenosis . This clinical observation study . Only chart review angiographic review perform .</brief_summary>
