	<brief_summary>Background : Frozen shoulder syndrome ( FSS ) adhesive capsulitits , condition uncertain etiology characterize progressive loss active passive shoulder motion , one common musculoskeletal disorder encounter daily orthopaedic practice remain challenge treat . To regain normal extensibility shoulder capsule tight muscular tissue , passive stretch shoulder capsule mean mobilization technique recommend , limited data support use treatment available . Due performance technique ( mid-range/end-range mobilization combine without interscalene brachial plexus block ) , lack objective subjective outcome criterion , inappropriate research design ( case report clinical trial without control ) , utilization treatment modality ( home exercise hot/cold pack ) , possible draw firm conclusion efficacy mobilization patient FSS . Objective : The aim study investigate effect mobilization treatment determine whether difference treatment efficacy exist among three mobilization technique ( mid-range mobilization , end-range mobilization , mobilization movement ) patient FSS . Design : We carry crossover multiple-treatment trial two group . In group one , A-B-A-C ( A : mid-range mobilization , B : end-range mobilization , C : mobilization movement ) multiple-treatment design use . In group two , A-C-A-B multiple-treatment design use . There three week phase . An independent trained outcome assessor , blind treatment allocation , evaluate participates baseline 3-week interval 12 week . Outcome assessment include pain perception , disability assessment , Shoulder complex kinematics associate muscular activity . Analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) undertake use follow data 3 , 6 , 9 12 week outcomes , adjustment baseline value outcome interest . Independent t-Tests conduct compare change outcome variable two group ( A-B one group vs. A-C group , A-C one group vs. A-B group ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobilization Techniques Patients With Frozen Shoulder : Randomized Multiple-Treatment Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We carry multiple-treatment trial two group . The multiple-treatment trial involve application two treatment one single-subject [ Portney Watkins , 2000 ; Barlow Hersen , 1984 ] . It use compare effect two treatment . Consenting patient randomize computer generate permuted block randomization 5 receive different mobilization treatment . Allocation concealment ensure study biostatistician keep assignment scheme . In group one , A-B-A-C ( A : mid-range mobilization , B : end-range mobilization , C : mobilization movement ) multiple-treatment design use . In group two , A-C-A-B multiple-treatment design use . The two group use intend counterbalance order effect treatment . There three week phase . The difference outcomes across four phase study examine . An independent trained outcome assessor , blind treatment allocation , evaluate participates baseline 3-week interval 12 week .</detailed_description>
