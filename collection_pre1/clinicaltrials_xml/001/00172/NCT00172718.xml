	<brief_summary>Osseointegrated root form implant apply successfully treat fully partially edentulous patient patient single tooth miss . However , success rate osseointegrated dental implant good patient poor bone quality . The reason believe poor bone quality reduce initial stability dental implant reduce success rate . For increase initial stability dental implant , technical modification suggest literature . However , due lack objective method evaluate bone quality , controversial . The purpose clinical study develop standard procedure use cut resistance measure Osseocare surgery evaluate bone quality compare clinical experience oral surgeon . The objective outcome , initial stability dental implant , measure Osstell . The analyzed result also helpful less experienced surgeon .</brief_summary>
