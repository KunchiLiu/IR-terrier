	<brief_title>PPD Size Mycobacteria Tuberculosis ELISPOT Children Who Have Received BCG Neonate Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sampling 1 . Age 3 year-old : target population contain 500 child use sample group . This cohort firstly enrol trial oral Rota vaccine since 2004 . They follow cohort 2006 . Sixty child enrol group young 1 year-old ( 1-2 , 2-3 year-old , 20 child enrol age group ) . 2 . Age 3 5 year-old , case enrol volunteered student kindergarden ( 3-4 , 4-5 , 5-6 year-old , 20 child enrol age group ) 3 . Age 6 15 year-old , case enrol volunteered student elementary school junior high school ( 30 child enrol age group ) . A total 300 child enrol child 6 year-old 15 year-old . 3 . A total 460 child age 3 month 15 y/o enrol . Procedure PPD test Children fit criterion give 0.1 ml PPD ( PPD RT23 , 2 unit ) intradermally , accordance guideline recommend WHO ( 17 ) . The tuberculin test obtain Denmark use throughout country . PPD induration read 48 72 h administration 90 degree long axis arm record near millimeter . Indurations &lt; =5 mm diameter classify negative , &gt; 5 &lt; =10 mm doubtful &gt; 10 mm positive accord previous consensus ( 2 ) . All size induration record analysis arbiturary classification . Procedure ELISPOT assay detect T cell specific M. tuberculosis antigens 4 ml whole blood collect heparinized tube first process score two scientist access personal identifier TST result within four hour collection . We amplify esat-6 gene genomic DNA isolate M bovis strain AN5 PCR , clone plasmid vector pET21d ( Novagen , Madison , WI , USA ) . Escherichia coli transform vector . Recombinant ESAT-6 recovered transform E coli purify nickel-affinity chromatography . We ex-vivo interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay , 300 000 peripheral blood mononuclear cell per well ( 14,18 ) . We use purify recombinant ESAT-6 PPD , addition negative control ( added antigen ) positive control ( phytohaemagglutinin ) . Positive ESAT-6 test well define contain least ten spot-forming cell , least twice many , negative control wells—a detection threshold one per 30 000 peripheral blood mononuclear cell . Assays do independently score two scientist unaware exposure category TST result contact . ELISPOT assay well contain 300 spot-forming cell count accurately spots coalesce . 300 cell per well ( equivalent 1000 cell per million peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) therefore take upper limit accuracy ( 15 ) . Exclusion Follow-up step Children find positive PPD test ( &gt; 10 mm ) , PPD size range 1st 2.5 percentile positive ELISPOT result time enrollment , closely follow clinical symptom sign TB necessary diagnostic workup do . If LTBI highly suspect , prophylaxis initiate . Closed contact family care-givers ask take CXR exclude active pulmonary TB . Information collection enrollment Cross-sectional study 160 child conduct . Children examine assess general health condition , BCG vaccination record , BCG scar L ’ arm ( 19 ) . Possible TB exposure include elderly chronic cough unexplained prolonged febrile illness house-hold contact , contact history document open TB thoroughly evaluate . Children suspicious immuno-compromised status , active lung disease exposure history TB exclude follow-up do . Biostatistic method Descriptive analysis use size PPD result ELISPOT . P value calculate student test Chi-square Fisher exact test statistic significance ( Version 10.0 , SPSS , SPSS Inc. Illinois ) different age group . 95 % CI calculate purpose cut value PPD size ( except unexpected-found TB disease ) .</detailed_description>
