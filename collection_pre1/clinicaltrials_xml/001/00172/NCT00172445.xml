	<brief_summary>Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease distinctive syndrome necrotizing lymphadenitis formally described 1972 two Japanese pathologist , Kikuchi Fujimoto . It benign , self-limited disease predominantly occur young woman . It common Asian people , especially Japanese . The frequent clinical presentation fever ( 30~50 % ) cervical lymphadenopathy , often tender palpable . Other lymph node region affect , hepatosplenomegaly may present . The laboratory finding include leucopenia atypical lymphocytosis . ESR , transaminases lactate dehydrogenase often raise . The clinical feature easily confuse condition , particularly lymphoma . Therefore diagnosis depend pathological finding . The typical finding paracortical lesion consist patchy zone eosinophilic fibrinoid necrosis abundant karyorrhexis . In general , spontaneous resolution symptom sign within month expect without treatment.For decade , etiology Kikuchi 's disease speculate . Although perforin Fas pathway cytotoxic T cell induce abundance apoptosis thus induce necrotizing lesion , trigger factor unknown . Since disease precede occur association connective tissue disorder , especially SLE , autoimmune contribution etiology also speculate . However , clinical course Kikuchi 's disease , often sudden onset spontaneous resolution , frequent flu-like upper respiratory prodrome , prominence cervical lymphadenopathy , support viral cause . Evidence viral cause also include peripheral blood atypical lymphocytosis elevate serum IFN-a 2 ` -5 ` oligoadenylate synthetase level . Several infectious agent suggest , include bacteria ( e.g . Brucella , Yersinia ) , parasites ( e.g . toxoplasmosis ) virus ( e.g . EBV , CMV , HHV6 , HHV8 , parvovirus B19 , HTLV , HIV ) .The aim study collect case Kikuchi ' disease bureau NHI NTUH . We analyze incidence rate , age onset , sex , season onset clinical course see clustered case , nosocomial infection . Then study etiology Kikuchi 's disease especially infection cause analyze pathologic specimen serology . We hope find etiology Kikuchi 's disease new treatment .</brief_summary>
