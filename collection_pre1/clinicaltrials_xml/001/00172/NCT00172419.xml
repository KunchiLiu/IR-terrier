	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular event lead cause death develop country worldwide , include Taiwan . The disruption atherosclerotic plaque subsequent formation thrombus currently recognize major cause morbidity mortality cardiovascular disease . Therefore , early detection vulnerable plaque clinically important risk stratification also provide early treatment . Several image approach adapt detect vulnerable plaque , include conventional X-ray contrast angiography , catheter capable detecting temperature heterogeneity , infrared light pH heterogeneity , ultrasonography ( include intravascular ultrasound ) , high-resolution compute tomography MRI . However , base morphologic characteristic atheroma . Moreover , although statin-induced lipid lower clinical benefit may occur matter week , stain-mediated plaque volume regression measure term year initiation statin therapy . These discrepancy highlight need great insight mechanism time course statin-induced plaque regression . As know , inflammation may play significant role pathogenesis progression atherosclerosis subsequent vulnerable plaque rupture . Recently , 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) , use 18FDG take surround macrophage smooth muscle cell , report detect atherosclerotic lesion bio-pathologic function . More evidence show FDG uptake marker hypermetabolic state atheromatous plaque , relate dense cellular infiltrate , contribute identification subgroup patient high risk complication . Recently , combine PET/CT emerge promising modality begin use routinely clinical situation , provide good localization detect calcification time . Therefore , use FDG PET/CT might sensitive quantification method monitor inflammatory activity vulnerable plaque aggressive statin treatment . It could also provide mechanism early beneficial effect statin treatment . Our subject investigate prospectively statin effect lipid lower anti-inflammatory human atherosclerotic lesion . We hypothesize statin-induced plaque regression could monitor clinically use FDG PET/CT approach , detect noninvasively earlier previously report , provide information early statin efficacy cause stabilization vulnerable plaque without affect lumen size .</detailed_description>
