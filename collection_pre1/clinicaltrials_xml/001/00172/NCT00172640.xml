	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one common malignancy world , especially sub-Saharan Africa Southeast Asia . Since 1984 , lead cause cancer death Taiwan . About 6000-8000 people die cancer every year Taiwan . DNA microarray ( DNA chip ) powerful tool clarify genetic change cancer . Expression profile technique use simultaneously monitor expression thousand gene human tumor sample . It successfully use predict clinical outcome survival well classify different type cancer . In study , use DNA chip study genetics liver cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The clinical sample collect NTUH , DNA microarray work do Biomedical Engineering Center ( BMEC ) ITRI . Patients A total 40 case HCC patient ( 20 HBV-related HCC 20 HCV-related HCC ) receive surgical resection National Taiwan University Hospital enrol tissue bank . The diagnosis HCC confirm pathological examination . The surgical specimen freeze immediately surgery store –140°C . The clinicopathological data retrospectively obtain chart review . Another total 40 new HCC patient receive surgical resection National Taiwan University Hospital collect . The healthy subject patient chronically infect HBV HCV without HCC use control . The whole blood collect , one six month operation . The diagnosis HCC confirm pathology . In addition whole blood , surgical specimen freeze immediately surgery store –140°C .</detailed_description>
