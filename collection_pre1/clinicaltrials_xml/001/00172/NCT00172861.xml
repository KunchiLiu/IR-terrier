	<brief_summary>Background : Gastric carcinoma ( GC ) remain among frequent malignancy Taiwan well world also one leading cause cancer-related death . Accumulating evidence show chronic inflammation lead occurrence cancer , include GC , via multiple mechanism . Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) crucial enzyme inflammatory process show up-regulated variety cancer . Therefore , COX-2 may play important role carcinogenesis . The hallmarks cancer include continue proliferation , evade apoptosis , prohibit immunity , promote angiogenesis , enhance invasion metastasis . We hypothesize COX-2 induces carcinogenesis multiple mechanistic strategy interaction multiple gene simultaneously . Laser capture microdissection ( LCM ) obtain pure cancer cell microarray technology analysis generally accept powerful tool genomic research , provide reliable microdissection cancer cell simultaneous analysis whole genome . Aim : Use microarray technology investigate pattern genomic change relate differential COX-2 expression clinicopathological association GC . Materials : GC cell line transfected COX-2-expressing vector establish cell line differential level COX-2 expression . Clinical specimen obtain surgical resection GC prove pathology Surgical Department National Taiwan University Hospital , COX-2 expression evaluate Western blot immunohistochemical staining . Methods : The present project use microarray analysis genome cluster pattern surgical tissue ( GC cell procure LCM ) GC cell line base differential COX-2 expression level , discover significantly positively negatively associate gene clustering contain candidate gene study carcinogenesis mechanisms establishment animal experiment model another component project . Execution : In first year 3-year project , establish GC cell line express differential COX-2 level transfection COX-2-expressing vector focus analyze genome microarray . We also start collect surgical specimen GC , record clinicopathological characteristic , procure cell LCM ass RNA quality , perform microarray experiment . In second year , continue LCM , RNA extraction , microarray experiment . In third year , microarray experiment total 60 pair , include 30 high-COX-2 case 30 low-COX-2 case , tumor non-tumoral tissue complete . Final analysis carry identify clustering , select candidate gene , investigate relationship clinicopathological characteristic , accord COX-2 expression . These gene subject mechanism animal study . We expect well understanding pattern gene cluster differential COX-2 gene expression .</brief_summary>
