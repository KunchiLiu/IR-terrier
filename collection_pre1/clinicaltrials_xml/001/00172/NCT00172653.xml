	<brief_title>Function-Related Tests Subjects With Stiff Shoulders : Reliability Validity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects : Subjects SDs recruit clinic department Orthopedics Physical Medicine Rehabilitation National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) . There three patient SD among 40 outpatient visit clinic week . It estimate least two subject SD per week participate study . Thus , take six month recruit 60 subject SD . All patient recruit test within 6-month period . They receive write verbal explanation purpose procedure study . If agree participate require sign approve informed consent form approve Human Subjects Committee NTUH . The inclusion criterion adult least 18 year old . Patients SD ( 1 ) limit ROM shoulder joint ( ROM loss 25 % great compare noninvolved shoulder least two follow shoulder motion : glenohumeral flexion , abduction , medial/lateral rotation ) , ( 2 ) pain stiffness shoulder region least three month , ( 3 ) consent patient 's physician participate study . Patients SD exclude examination physical therapist ( 1 ) reproduction cervical symptom cervical screen examination ( active resist range motion , active resist range motion overpressure , quadrant test ) , ( 2 ) numbness tingle upper extremity , ( 3 ) history onset symptom due traumatic injury , glenohumeral AC joint dislocation ; ( 4 ) surgery shoulder . Function-related test : Hand-in-neck : The hand-in-neck test score 5-point scale , zero represent normal function four indicate decrease function ( Table 1 ) [ Mannerkorpi et al. , 1999 ] . For test , patient stand place hand posterior aspect neck . The test performance patient fibromyalgia significantly decrease comparison healthy subject [ Mannerkorpi et al. , 1999 ] . It know , however , extent performance compromise patient SD . Hand-to-scapula : The hand-to-scapula test score 5-point scale , zero represent normal function 4 indicates decrease function ( Table 1 ) [ Mannerkorpi et al. , 1999 ] . This common task perform difficulty patient limit range motion shoulder joint . The test performance patient fibromyalgia also significantly decrease comparison healthy subject [ Mannerkorpi et al. , 1999 ] . Hand-to-opposite-scapula : The hand-to-opposite-scapula test score 4-point scale , zero represent normal function three indicate decrease function ( Table 1 ) . Modified Kibler 's lateral scapular slide test : Kibler et al . [ 1998 2002 ] characterize scapula dysfunction side-to-side comparison scapular arm elevation well 3 test position ( Table 1 ) . Measurements scapula symmetry take bilaterally inferior angle scapula . In study , use modify Kibler 's lateral scapular slide test ( LSST ) . The observed difference assess three-point scale ( Table . 1 ) . The reliability validity test assess patient SD . Pain : Measures pain included ass validity . The patient asked rate pain movement accord scale pain assign 0 point worst possible pain assign 10 point . Self-report measure : Self-report measure valuable , since present patient ' perception multifaceted effect shoulder disorder . The literature show various self-report scale assessment functional limitation disability shoulder available [ Michener Leggin , 2001 ] . Each scale different developer questionnaire place particular emphasis selection item vast range symptom patient shoulder disorder . The selection disabilities arm , shoulder hand ( DASH ) Flexilevel Scale Shoulder Function ( FLEX-SF ) ass shoulder function disability study base entire continuum assessment shoulder function appropriate psychometric property reliability , validity , responsiveness clinical change [ Beaton et al. , 2001 ; Cook et al. , 2003 ] . DASH : The DASH outcome measure 30-item , self-report questionnaire design measure physical function symptom subject musculoskeletal disorder upper extremity . Beaton et al . [ 2001 ] evaluate reliability , validity , responsiveness DASH two hundred patient shoulder problem demonstrate good validity , test-retest reliability , responsiveness DASH . The DASH scale 0-100 score . A high score indicate great disability . DASH disability/symptom score = [ ( sum n response ) /n - 1 ] x 25 n equal number complete response . FLEX-SF : In scale , respondent answer single question grossly classify level function low , medium , high . They respond item target level function . Scores record 1 , limited function , 50 without limited function subject . This scale test 400 subject SDs show high reliability ( intraclass correlation coefficient [ 3,1 ] = 0.90 ) good validity ( Guyatt responsiveness index = 1.12 ) [ Cook et al. , 2003 ] . Quality life : Quality life assess 10-cm visual analog scale 0 cm indicate excellent quality life 10 cm indicate worst imaginable . Instrumentation : The FASTRAK motion analysis system ( Polhemus Inc. , Colchester , VT , USA ) surface electromyography ( sEMG ) device use detect shoulder complex movement associate muscle activity . The sEMG assembly include differential silver-silver chloride surface electrode ( inter-electrode distance 30 mm , 4 mm diameter ) , pre-amplifier headbox ( gain 150 ) , Bagnoli-8 amplifier ( DelSys Inc. , PO Box 15734 , Boston , MA , USA ) , gain 1000 , high input impedance ( 10 M Ohm 60 Hz ) , common mode rejection ratio 92 dB 60 Hz , bandwidth ( -3 dB ) 20 500 Hz . The sEMG data collect 2500 Hz/channel use 16-bit A/D board . Full bandwidth sEMG data reduce use root mean square ( RMS ) algorithm produce sEMG envelope effective sample rate 20 s/s . These envelope data basis subsequent processing . Our previous investigation demonstrate system good reliability characterize functional task [ Lin et al. , 2004 ] . Procedures : Reliability , validity , potential clinical use battery function-related test : Demographic information , physical examination , completion pain scale report , self-report measure ( DASH FLEX-SF ) assess patient . Two physical therapist minimum 5 year ' clinical experience independently measure patient function-related test test session . One two tester measure patient function-related test twice 3 5 day ' separation . Biomechanical characteristic battery function-related test : Surface electrode place upper trapezius muscle ( two third distance spinous process seventh cervical vertebra acromion process ) , low trapezius muscle ( one fourth distance thoracic spine inferior angle scapula arm fully flexed sagittal plane ) , low serratus anterior muscle ( muscle fiber anterior latissimus dorsi muscle arm flex 90Â° sagittal plane ) [ Perotto , 1994 ] . Verification signal quality investigate muscle subject perform resist contraction manual muscle test position specific muscle interest . The FASTRAK sensor next attached adhesive tape sternum skin overlie flat superior bony surface scapular acromial process . A third sensor attach distal humerus lateral medial epicondyle adhesive tape . These surface sensor placement believe few skin movement artifact . A fourth sensor attach object accord test functional task . In addition , another sensor attach stylus use manually digitize palpated anatomical coordinate . Kinematic EMG data collect 5 second rest seated posture . Subjects ask perform battery function-related task . The order function-related task randomize . Once subject familiar functional task , synchronize kinematic EMG data 3 trial test task collect . Subjects give approximately 2 3 minute rest practice test condition . All subject query regard need additional rest prevent fatigue . Sensors remove replaced trial . Data reduction follow method present previous publish study [ Lin et al. , 2004 ] . Data analysis : Reliability : Descriptive statistic include mean standard deviation calculate trial tester . For intratester reliability measure tester , data two test day , 3 5 day apart , use calculate kappa statistic . For intertester reliability measure two tester , data within test session , 20 minute , use calculate kappa statistic . Validity : All measure use calculation Pearson correlation Spearman 's rho correlation coefficient individual trial measure . For intratester intertester reliability measure ( hand-to-scapula , hand-to-opposite-scapula , modify Kibler 's LSST position 1 2 ) , measure outcome trial 1 , tester 1 use . The average test-retest result use correlation analysis . Pearson correlation Spearman 's rho correlation coefficient calculate , correlation matrix examine evidence convergent discriminative validity among pain , disability , function-related measure patient SD . Biomechanical characteristic battery function-related test : Principle axis factor analysis perform kinematic measurement muscular EMG activity characterize factor load task . The kinematic measurement ( dependent variable ) include reliable angular variable peak scapular upward rotation , peak scapular tipping , peak scapular protraction , peak humeral elevation , peak scapular elevation , plane humeral elevation , humeral rotation test task . The muscle EMG ( dependent variable ) include reliable mean RMS percentages upper trapezius , low trapezius , serratus anterior task .</detailed_description>
