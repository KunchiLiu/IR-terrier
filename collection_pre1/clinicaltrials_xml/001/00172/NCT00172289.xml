	<detailed_description>There many disease related dysfunction sympathetic nerve activity rehabilitation medicine . Shoulder hand syndrome , common complication cerebrovascular accident , believe combine hyper-exciting sympathetic nerve lesion side . Autonomic dysfunction spinal cord injury patient come vicious cycle local stimulation sympathetic nerve result elevate blood pressure . Myofascial pain syndrome report abnormal sympathetic activity late stage . Considering fact , accurate evaluation sympathetic nerve activity important issue rehabilitation practice . Measuring skin temperature status local sweat common method evaluate sympathetic nerve activity . However , many external environment factor would interfere result , accuracy result questionable . Sympathetic skin reflex traditional electrodiagnostic method measure sympathetic nerve activity , application limit poor reproducibility . Microneurography measure sympathetic nerve activity along distribution peroneus bronchial nerve insert needles nerve , application limit invasive nature test . When heart contract , pump blood peripheral vessel transit pulse wave along vessel wall . The propagation velocity pulse wave different blood flow . According theory wave transmission , speed wave transmission dependent nature transmission medium , vessel wall pulse wave transmission . Then , pulse wave velocity relate mechanical property vessel wall . The mechanical property vessel wall determine texture vessel wall contraction status smooth muscle within vessel wall . Because texture vessel wall could change short duration , sympathetic nerve activity , control contractibility smooth muscle , become determinant factor pulse wave velocity . So , pulse wave velocity may reflect status sympathetic nerve activity . There limited report regard pulse wave velocity measurement lack report clinical application . The present project plan measure pulse wave simultaneously four limbs pressure receptor , use electrocardiogram reference synchronize record pulse wave different vessel , use correct data calculate pulse wave velocity . With pulse wave velocity different vessel , understand local sympathetic nerve activity different disease different site . The first year , set equipment measure pulse wave velocity , apply 20 healthy subject adjust measurement error ascertain reproducibility machine . The second year , apply measurement 15 complete cervical cord injury individual 15 healthy subject different erect angle tilt table . This procedure make u understand response sympathetic nerve activity different posture normal subject cervical cord injury patient . The third year , apply measurement 30 cerebrovascular accident patient understand change sympathetic nerve activity stroke . By compare clinical information , hope clear relationship sympathetic nerve activity pulse wave velocity . The study use self-designed pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) machine measure patient cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The CVA patient divide two group without shoulder pain . The skin temperature range motion record . We hypothesize patient shoulder pain may higher sympathetic activity high speed PWV . Sixty patient include . For SCI patient , compare PWV upper extremity low extremity . We hypothesize cervical cord injury patient lower sympathetic tone lesion , low speed PWV compare upper extremity . Through study , confirm hypothesis PWV accurate method measure sympathetic activity understand change sympathetic activity CVA SCI patient .</detailed_description>
