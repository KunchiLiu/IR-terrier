	<brief_summary>Aims This study conduct examine association ACE insertion/deletion ( I/D ) genotype distribution child idiopathic nephrotic syndrome response steroid therapy . Patients Methods The patient idiopathic nephrotic syndrome divide 2 group accord clinical response steroid : SS group include infrequent frequent relapsers non-SS group include steroid resistant ( SR ) steroid dependent ( SD ) patient . Children without previous renal disease negative proteinuria enrol control group genetic study . The genotype ACE gene I/D polymorphism include DD , ID II analyze newly develop automatic denaturing high performance liquid chromatography system ( DHPLC ) .</brief_summary>
