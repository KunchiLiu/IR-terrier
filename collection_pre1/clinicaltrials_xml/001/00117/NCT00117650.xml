	<criteria>Males females 40 80 year age , inclusive . Clinical diagnosis PAD , secondary atherosclerosis , low limb , confirm objective evidence : An anklebrachial index ( ABI ) ≤ 0.90 rest least 1 low limb ( Note : The index limb must ≤ 0.90 rest . ) ; The ABI exercise must reduce ≥ 20 % ABI rest index leg ( symptomatic leg treadmill test ) . The postexercise ABI also perform leg rest ABI &gt; 0.90 . A patient may eligible study rest ABI nonindex limb &gt; 0.90 : . The postexercise ABI nonindex leg also reduce great equal 20 % OR ; b . A medically significant stenosis ( define ≥ 50 % ) femoropopliteal infrapopliteal artery present , document via image study ( MR , conventional angiography , duplex ultrasound , CT ) ; If ABI measure either leg ( due noncompressible artery ) , toebrachial index ( TBI ) ≤ 0.70 may use place confirm PAD . Symptoms severe intermittent claudication ( IC ) least 1 low limb persist ≥ 6 month Patients peak walking time ( PWT ) 1 12 minute ( inclusive ) use standardize exercise treadmill test 2 consecutive treadmill test perform least week apart Screening period . During Screening , patient must demonstrate consistency PWTs 2 standardize exercise treadmill test ( Walk 1 Walk 2 ) perform least 1 week apart . Consistency PWT 2 visit achieve difference PWT Walk 1 Walk 2 ≤ 25 % high 2 PWTs ( [ high PWT low PWT ] /higher PWT ) . If difference PWT Walk 1 Walk 2 &gt; 25 % high 2 PWTs , third treadmill test ( Walk 3 ) may perform discretion Principal Investigator 7 14 day follow Walk 2 . The variability PWT warrant performance Walk 3 must secondary circumstance may contribute observed variation ( e.g. , prior exertion , inconsistent timing , ingestion meal within 4 hour , etc ) . To qualify study , difference PWT either Walk 1 Walk 2 compare Walk 3 must ≤ 25 % high 2 PWTs ( [ high PWT low PWT ] /higher PWT ) . The decision whether Walk 1 Walk 2 use comparison Walk 3 make prospectively review Sponsor . An acceptable mean PWT must achieve within 4 week treatment administration . Patients consider potential treatment option include exercise rehabilitation , smoke cessation , pharmacological therapy prior Enrollment . Claudication severity , concomitant medication treatment CAD , PAD , IC , smoke status exercise habit clinically stable 3 month prior Enrollment . Patients commit follow protocol requirement evidence write informed consent . Patients either current history Critical Limb Ischemia ( CLI ; , patient classify Rutherford Category 4 [ ischemic rest pain ] , Rutherford Category 5 [ nonhealing ischemic ulcer minor tissue loss ] , Rutherford Category 6 [ nonhealing ischemic ulcer major tissue loss ] ) . Patients arterial insufficiency lower extremity result acute limb ischemia immunological inflammatory nonatherosclerotic disorder ( eg , thromboangiitis obliterans [ Buerger 's Disease ] ) systemic sclerosis [ limit diffuse form ] ) . A PADspecific surgical revascularization procedure within 6 month enrollment PADspecific percutaneous procedure within 3 month enrollment , patient likely require PADspecific revascularization procedure within 6 month Enrollment . Patients aortoiliac disease limit inflow either leg : . Patients concomitant aortoiliac disease ( i.e. , patient significant component inflow disease distal aorta , common external iliac , proximal common femoral artery ) assess image modality ( e.g. , segmental limb pressure waveform analysis , duplex ultrasound scan , magnetic resonance angiography , radiocontrast arteriogram ) perform within 1 year prior Enrollment . If subject bypass imaging study , documentation graft patency require within 6 month prior Enrollment ; b . If suspect Screening patient aortoiliac disease base vascular examination , image modality ( e.g. , segmental limb pressure waveform analysis , duplex ultrasound scan , magnetic resonance angiography , radiocontrast arteriogram ) must perform rule one available within time specify . If suspicion aortoiliac disease Principal Investigator 's judgment , image test Screening require study purpose . Patients walk impairment due pain index leg result nonatherosclerotic comorbid condition : venous claudication , chronic compartment syndrome , peripheral nerve pain ( e.g. , severe peripheral neuropathy ) , pseudoclaudication cause spinal cord compression , acute limb ischemia , Principal Investigator 's judgment severe enough confound assessment patient 's IC . Conditions IC significant severity could confound PWT standardized exercise treadmill test causing premature inconsistent termination exercise ( e.g. , angina pectoris , heart failure [ New York Heart Association { NYHA } Classes III IV ] , respiratory disease [ e.g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ] , orthopedic disease , neurological disorder , rheumatologic disorder [ e.g. , severe degenerative joint disease ] , dyspnea , fatigue , prior low limb amputation , include amputation proximal metatarsal phalangeal joint ) .
