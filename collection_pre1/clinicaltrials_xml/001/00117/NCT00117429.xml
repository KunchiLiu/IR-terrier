	<brief_summary>This study test safety immunogenicity gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine candidate individual chronic HIV-1 infection successfully treat HAART . The rationale study base previous scientific experiment , include data indicate vaccine elicit strong HIV-1-specific T cell immune response human monkey lead retardation HIV-1 disease progression animal model HIV-1 infection . The HIV vaccine administer study consist three recombinant HIV clade B viral antigen : envelope glycoprotein gp120 two regulatory protein , Nef Tat.The antigen formulate proprietary adjuvant , AS02A , comprise two immunostimulants oil-in-water emulsion ( gp120/NefTat/AS02A ) . The vaccine adjuvant manufacture provide study GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals , Rixensart , Belgium . The drug give intramuscular ( IM ) injection standard dose 20 mg together 0.5 ml AS02A adjuvant . Twenty HIV-1 infected individual randomly enrol three different study group , receive either gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine ( 10 individual ) , AS02A adjuvant alone ( 5 individual ) placebo ( 5 individual ) . After obtain informed consent , subject history physical exam perform laboratory test confirm meet inclusion exclusion entry criterion . Women childbearing potential pregnancy test prior injection investigational product . Injections vaccine , adjuvant alone , placebo perform week 0 , 4 , 12 . Study participant undergo close monitoring vaccination . Blood sample obtain immunological assay study baseline ( 2 time ) week 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 14 , 24 , 48 . All patient maintain antiretroviral treatment regimen entire study period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study HIV gp120/NefTat/AS02A Vaccine Treat Individuals With Chronic HIV-1 Infection Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN : This study randomize , double blind clinical trial gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine individual well-controlled chronic HIV-1 infection successfully treat highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . The adjuvanted protein vaccine candidate consist three recombinant viral antigen : envelope glycoprotein gp120 two regulatory protein , Nef Tat . The latter express one recombinant fusion protein , NefTat . The antigen formulate proprietary AS02A adjuvant . The goal trial ass safety immunogenicity gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine HIV-1-infected individual . DURATION : 48 week SAMPLE SIZE : 20 subject POPULATION : Subjects chronic HIV-1 infection receive highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) HIV RNA level &lt; 50 copies/mL least two measurement previous 6 month CD4+ T cell count &gt; 400 cells/mm3 within 45 day study entry eligible study . REGIMEN : Enrolled patient randomize receive either vaccine ( gp120/NefTat/AS02A ) ( 10 individual ) , AS02A adjuvant ( 5 individual ) placebo ( 5 individual ) . Injections administer IM week 0 , 4 , 12 . OBJECTIVES : The two primary objective study : - evaluate safety tolerability gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine individual well-controlled chronic HIV-1 infection HAART ; - evaluate cell-mediated immune response ( IL-2 secreting CD4+ T cell ) least one vaccinal antigen induce vaccine-adjuvant combination individual chronic HIV-1 infection successful HAART , two week third vaccination . ENDPOINTS : The two co-primary study endpoint : - occurrence , intensity , relationship local general sign symptoms 7-day follow-up period vaccination ( primary safety endpoint ) ; - change frequency IL-2 secrete CD4+ T cell response least one vaccinal antigen ( primary immunogenicity endpoint ) three different patient category , assess two week third vaccination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The study include subject meet follow criterion : Male female , 18 60 year age time first vaccination Informed consent sign prior study procedures No evidence acute HIV seroconversion 12 month prior initiation antiretroviral therapy Receiving potent antiretroviral drug regimen minimum 12 consecutive month prior screen interruption therapy &gt; 2 week . A potent antiretroviral drug regimen define follow : *two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor either protease inhibitor nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ; *a boost protease inhibitor either one two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor . Documented suppressed HIV1 RNA . Subjects must plasma HIV1 RNA value &lt; 50 copies/ml least two measurement 6 month prior study entry . CD4+ T cell count &gt; 400 cells/mm3 within 45 day first vaccination CD4 count &gt; 200 cells/mm3 time Laboratory value within 45 day prior first vaccination meet follow criterion : Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL ; Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mm3 ; Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 ; Prothrombin time ( PT ) &lt; 1.2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) &lt; 1.5 x ULN ; Total serum creatinine &lt; 1.3 x ULN ; Total serum bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x ULN ; Alkaline phosphatase , AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 1.5 x ULN . Negative serologic test HBsAg Negative serologic test antibody HCV negative HCV PCR antiHCV antibody positive . Female patient childbearing potential must : Have negative urine pregnancy test ( sensitive 25 IU HCG ) immediately prior vaccination ; Have intention conceive entire study period ; Agree use effective method birth control entire study period . Effective method birth control include : 1 . Condoms ( male female ) without spermicidal agent . Condoms recommend appropriate use contraception method effective prevent HIV transmission ; 2 . Diaphragm cervical cap spermicide ; 3 . Intrauterine device ( IUD ) . An IUD adequate method birth control , increase risk pelvic inflammatory disease ; 4 . An FDAapproved oral contraceptive , provide interaction woman 's current antiretroviral therapy medication ; If participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , male subject partner must also use contraception . HIV1 RNA &gt; 50 copies/mL within 6 month screen . Received antiretroviral therapy within 12 month know HIV1 seroconversion . History clinically significant cardiac , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , pancreatic , neurological disease Recent ( &lt; 24 hour ) febrile illness day vaccination ( temperature &gt; 101 degree F , oral ) History CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 . Female subject pregnant nursing child Received immune globulin blood product within 3 month prior vaccination plan receive product study Received live vaccine within 30 day prior study vaccination inactivate vaccine within 14 day prior study vaccination Previously participate HIV vaccine clinical trial ( unless document subject receive placebo ) History AIDS define illness Any change antiretroviral drug regimen within 12 week prior screen Use immunomodulatory agent within 30 day prior study enrollment plan use trial Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion sponsor , would interfere adherence study requirement . Any condition history illness , opinion investigator , might interfere evaluation study objective Subject history anaphylaxis vaccine Subject history allergy adjuvant component Subject take follow medication : systemic steroid ( inhale nasal steroid therapy permit ) , interleukins , systemic interferon ( e.g . local injection interferon alpha treatment HPV permit ) systemic chemotherapy</criteria>
