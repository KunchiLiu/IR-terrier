	<detailed_description>Oxidative damage show factor Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , study suggest supplemental anti-oxidants decrease risk AD slow progression . There many candidate antioxidant , include combination , could neuroprotective establish AD could efficacy prevention AD . However , test possibility standard clinical trial prohibitively expensive . This study examine antioxidant supplement vitamin target specific cellular compartment , look evidence biologically relevant effect AD measurement biomarkers CSF . Two general cellular compartment antioxidant supplement may act cytosol mitochondrion . The study examine combination antioxidant act primarily cytosolic site ( vitamin E + C + Î±-lipoic acid ) single mitochondrial antioxidant , coenzyme Q10 . This multicenter trial recruit 75 participant randomize three group : 1 . 25 participant give combination vitamin E 800 IU , vitamin C 200 mg , alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg formulate three capsule , one capsule give three time per day meal , plus two placebo wafer three time per day meal ; 2 . 25 participant give CoQ 400 mg , compound wafer , two wafer three time per day meal , plus one placebo capsule three time per day meal ; 3 . 25 participant give placebo wafer , two wafer three time per day meal , plus one placebo capsule three time per day meal . The treatment period last four month . The effect two anti-oxidant treatment evaluate measure biomarkers blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) begin end 4-month period .</detailed_description>
