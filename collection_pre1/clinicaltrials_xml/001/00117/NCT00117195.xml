	<brief_summary>The goal study investigate neurophysiologic test potential serve screening tool Parkinson 's disease . These neurophysiologic test administer individual Parkinson 's disease parkinsonian syndrome validate healthy control population . Specifically , study look change motor function , cognitive function , handwriting , speech , olfactory function individual Parkinson 's disease , individual risk Parkinson 's disease healthy control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Neurophysiologic Changes Individuals With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One great challenge Parkinson 's research identification individual risk early Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) parkinsonian syndrome ( PS ) . Subtle sign meet diagnostic criterion PD may occur period . This study evaluate profile neurophysiologic test potentially predictive sign PD PS individual PD PS , may risk PD PS population individual without parkinsonian symptom neurologic condition . In addition , study evaluate serum sample change protein metabolite may indicators early change associate Parkinson 's disease parkinsonian syndrome . Each study participant schedule 90 minute study visit . This visit may include follow procedure : - Screening eligibility - Clinical assessment - Neurological evaluation - Computerized cognitive test - Olfactory test - Computerized handwriting test - Speech evaluation - Blood sample biochemical and/or genetic analysis The study conduct Institute Neurodegenerative Disorders ( IND ) , profit research institute specialize Parkinson 's disease research . Clinical data collect , store analyzed IND evaluate whether significant difference performance parkinsonian study participant , individual risk factor PD PS , healthy subject .</detailed_description>
