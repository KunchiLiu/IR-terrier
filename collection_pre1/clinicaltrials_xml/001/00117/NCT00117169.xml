	<brief_title>Multi-Detector Spiral Computed Tomography Alone Versus Combined Strategy With Lower Limb Compression Ultrasonography Outpatients Suspected Pulmonary Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Suspected pulmonary embolism [ PE ] frequent clinical problem remain diagnostic challenge . The diagnostic approach PE rely sequential diagnostic test , plasma D-dimer measurement , low limb compression ultrasonography , ventilation-perfusion lung scan helical compute tomography [ hCT ] pulmonary angiography . In addition , diagnostic workup usually stratify accord clinical probability pulmonary embolism . First-generation hCTs base single-detector technique limit 70 % sensitivity . Moreover , two recent outcome study , proximal deep venous thrombosis diagnose low limb compression ultrasonography find 15 % patient normal single-detector hCT . However , management study , association normal low limb compression ultrasonography normal single-detector hCT prove safe rule PE patient non-high clinical probability , le 2 % rate thromboembolic event 3-month follow-up patient leave untreated base combination . Hence , low limb compression ultrasonography must combine single-detector CT safely rule pulmonary embolism . More recently , multi-detector hCT become widely available . These new scanner allow one improve image definition diminish slice thickness without increase acquisition time , hence , good visualize segmental sub-segmental pulmonary artery . In recent study [ CTEPm ] , investigator evaluate performance multi-detector hCT . The rate false negative result , assessed rate patient proximal DVT ultrasonography negative hCT , much low use multi-detector CT [ 0.9 % , 95 % confidence interval : 0.3-3.3 % ] single-detector technique [ 15 % ] . This raise possibility hCT might use single test rule PE patient elevate D-dimer level . Indeed , ELISA plasma D-dimer measurement patient non-high clinical probability PE remain logical first step since safely rule PE approximately 30 % patient . Such strategy validate prospective randomise outcome study compare safety cost-effectiveness previously validate strategy combine D-dimer , low limb compression ultrasonography hCT . Therefore , investigator plan compare efficacy cost-effectiveness two distinct diagnostic strategy suspect pulmonary embolism emergency center patent non-inferiority trial . The strategy : 1 ) algorithm base clinical assessment , D-dimer multi-detector hCT ( DD-hCT ) ; 2 ) previously validate strategy include low limb compression ( DD-US-hCT ) . The main outcome rate thromboembolic event formal 3-month follow-up patient anticoagulated basis PE rule diagnostic criterion study arm . A secondary outcome cost diagnosis study arm , include cost suspect and/or confirm thromboembolic event follow-up . In addition , investigator aim prospectively pragmatically validate revise Geneva score assess clinical probability PE use sequential diagnostic work-up PE . Classification performances score assess check capacity discriminate patient low , intermediate , high probability PE . Finally , nest study , investigator aim compare clinical usefulness complete low limb compression ultrasonography versus classical `` 4-points ultrasonography '' ( ultrasonography proximal vein ) patient ultrasound arm study ( DD-US-hCT ) . Indeed , preliminary data indicate complete ultrasound detect DVT high proportion patient PE proximal ultrasound ( US ) , hence , potential limiting requirement chest image patient suspect PE . Because find distal DVT uncertain clinical significance , find report clinician charge patient patient undergo helical CT treat ( ) accord CT result . Outcome measurement number patient hCT could avoid rule diagnosis PE presence distal DVT ( proportion patient distal DVT ultrasonography pulmonary embolism multi-detector hCT ) number patient would unduly anticoagulated consider presence distal DVT complete compression ultrasonography ( proportion patient distal DVT ultrasonography , without pulmonary embolism multi-detector hCT , without thromboembolic event 3 month follow-up ) .</detailed_description>
