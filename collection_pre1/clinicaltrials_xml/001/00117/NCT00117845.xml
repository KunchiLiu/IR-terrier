	<detailed_description>Background : Adult T-Cell Leukemia lymphoproliferative disorder characterize presence CD4/CD25 express T cell ( IL-2R express ) peripheral blood , lymphoid tissue . Denileukin diftitox genetically engineer fusion protein combine enzymatically active domain diphtheria toxin ( DT ) full length sequence interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) target IL-2 express malignancy . Denileukin diftitox interacts IL-2 R cell surface , internalized via endocytosis , inhibit cellular protein synthesis result cell death within hour day . Objective : Determine clinical response Denileukin diftitox ( Ontak ) patient adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) . Define safety Denileukin diftitox patient ATL . Eligibility : Patients chronic , lymphomatous acute form ATL . Patients must human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV1 ) positive . Design : Patients treat 9mcg/kg/d Denileukin diftitox five day , every two week schedule . Tumor response evaluate two cycle treatment . Stable respond patient continue treatment evaluation every four cycle treatment . Patients treat two cycle beyond complete remission . The trial use optimal 2 stage design target true response proportion great 30 % . Nine patient treat initially expansion 29 patient response see one initial nine patient treat . If response see 9 mcg/kg/d dose additional 9 patient treat dose 18 mcg/kg/d expansion 29 patient dose level response see . A stopping rule excessive toxicity incorporate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must serum antibody direct human Tlymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLVI ) . All patient must histologically confirm diagnosis adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma 10 % malignant cell must express cluster differentiation 25 ( CD25 ) . All stage Tacexpressing adult T cell leukemia except smolder eligible : patient chronic , lymphomatous acute adult Tcell leukemia ( ATL ) eligible . ( See appendix 2 characteristic patient various stage ATL ) Patients must measurable disease . All patient great 10 % abnormal ( i.e . TAC homogenous strongly express ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) peripheral blood deem measurable disease . The patient must granulocyte count least 1000/mm^3 platelet count great equal 50,000/mm^3 . Patients must creatinine less 2.0 mg/dl . Omission cytotoxic chemotherapy ATL 3 week prior entry trial require . However , patient receive corticosteroid eligible . Patients must life expectancy great 2 month . Eligible patient must great equal 18 year old . There upper age limit . Patients must serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) value less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal bilirubin less equal 3.0/dl . If liver function test judged elevate due underlie ATL , parameter consider unevaluable parameter toxicity determination . Patients must serum albumin great equal 2.5 g/dl Patients must able understand sign Informed Consent form . All patient must use adequate contraception participation trial three month complete therapy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients symptomatic leukemic meningitis exclude . However , patient ATL another HTLVIassociated disease , tropical spastic paraparesis ( TSP ) , include . Pregnant nursing patient eligible study . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient exclude study . Denileukin diftitox may produce different pattern toxicity immunocompromised individual . Patients Smoldering ATL exclude . Patients serious intercurrent illness , past history myocardial infarction within 6 month severe coronary artery disease Patients previously receive Denileukin diftitox ineligible .</criteria>
