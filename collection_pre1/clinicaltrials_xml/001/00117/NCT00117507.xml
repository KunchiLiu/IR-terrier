	<brief_summary>Thirty patient enrol open-label , single-arm trial design assess safety tolerability oral deferasirox adult transfusion dependent myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) patient iron overload . Patients enrol study low intermediate ( INT-1 ) risk MDS per International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) criterion . All patient initiate treatment 20mg/kg/day deferasirox . Deferasirox administer orally per day 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient low intermediate ( INT1 ) risk MDS , determine via IPSS criterion , transfusional iron overload . NOTE : Bone marrow morphology cytogenetic study complete within 3 month prior screen use patient hematologically stable . Every attempt obtain cytogenetics study make ; however , culture failure , repeat marrow aspiration mandate . In case , RAEB le 11 % marrow blast accept . Patients EITHER naïve iron chelation OR prior treatment deferoxamine ( DFO ) . DFO must discontinue day prior start deferasirox dosing . Age : great equal 18 year Serum ferritin : For entry screen period : serum ferritin great equal 1000 µg/mL least two occasion , least two week apart , prior year . Samples must obtain absence concomitant infection ; For enrollment study : serum ferritin great equal 1000 µg/mL screening ( via central lab ) obtain absence concomitant infection A lifetime minimum 30 previous pack red cell transfusion Life expectancy great equal 6 month Women must negative serum urine pregnancy test use effective method contraception , must undergo clinically document total hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy , tubal ligation postmenopausal ( define amenorrhea least 12 month ) . Able provide write informed consent Serum creatinine upper limit normal ALT great 250 U/L screen Clinical laboratory evidence active hepatitis B hepatitis C ( HBsAg absence HBsAb OR HCV Ab positive HCV RNA positive ALT normal range ) Significant proteinuria indicate urinary protein/creatinine ratio great 0.5 mg/mg nonfirst void urine sample screening ( alternatively two three sample obtain screen ) History HIV positive test result ( ELISA Western blot ) ECOG performance status great 2 Uncontrolled systemic hypertension Unstable cardiac disease control standard medical therapy Third degree atrioventricular ( AV ) block QT interval prolongation normal range History clinically relevant ocular toxicity relate iron chelation Systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would prevent study treatment Pregnancy breast feeding Treatment systemic investigational drug within past 4 week topical investigational drug within past 7 day . Other surgical medical condition might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion drug . The investigator guide evidence following : inflammatory bowel syndrome , gastritis , ulcer , gastrointestinal rectal bleeding ; major gastrointestinal tract surgery , gastrectomy , gastroenterostomy , bowel resection ; pancreatic injury pancreatitis indication impair pancreatic function/injury , indicate abnormal lipase amylase ; urinary obstruction difficulty void . History noncompliance medical regimen patient consider potentially unreliable and/or cooperative</criteria>
