	<brief_summary>The combine use chemotherapeutic drug radiation proven effective improve overall survival local control among patient locally advanced head neck cancer . Induction chemotherapy give receive local treatment show reduce rate distant failure . Many drug find prevent tumor cell grow dividing , although yet determine agent , specific combination agent , effective treat head neck cancer . Docetaxel drug report show promising activity Phase II head neck cancer study . Therefore , purpose trial compare effectiveness induction chemotherapy follow chemoradiotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy alone patient locally advanced head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Based Chemotherapy Plus Minus Induction Chemotherapy Decrease Events Head Neck Cancer ( DeCIDE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TRIAL DESIGN : Phase III trial induction therapy docetaxel follow chemoradiotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy alone patient nodal stage N2 N3 head neck cancer OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine effect overall survival induction chemotherapy administer prior chemoradiotherapy patient N2 N3 disease . Secondary - To determine effect induction chemotherapy administer prior chemoradiotherapy distant failure-free survival , failure pattern , progression free survival quality life . TREATMENT PLAN : - After eligibility confirm , patient randomize one two treatment arm : Arm A - Induction + chemoradiotherapy Arm B - Chemoradiotherapy alone - Induction therapy : Two 21-day cycle chemotherapy consist docetaxel ( day 1 ) , cisplatin ( day 1 ) , 5-fluorouracil ( day 1-5 ) . Total duration 6 week . - Chemoradiotherapy : Five 14-day cycle docetaxel ( day 1 ) , 5-fluorouracil ( day 0-4 ) , hydroxyurea ( day 0-4 ) twice daily radiation ( day 1-5 ) . Total duration 10 week . - All patient undergo surgical evaluation chemoradiation possible neck dissection . - Upon completion treatment , patient monitor every three month first year , every six month second third year , annually thereafter , five year . - Patients follow Quality Life ( QOL ) course treatment , well annually thereafter , five year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : - An expected sample size 400 patient enrol study ( 200 per treatment arm ) .</detailed_description>
