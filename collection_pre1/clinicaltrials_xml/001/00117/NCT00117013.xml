	<brief_summary>Background : HIF-1 common mediator hypoxic non-hypoxic pathway affect transcriptional program lead survival , angiogenesis , migration invasion cancer cell . We demonstrate chronic administration topotecan inhibits HIF-1alpha expression , angiogenesis tumor growth human xenograft . Notably , mechanism topotecan inhibits HIF-1alpha protein expression independent replication-mediated DNA damage , suggest mechanism action distinct cytotoxic effect . Objectives : This clinical trial design explore hypothesis chronic administration topotecan ( TPT ) inhibit Hypoxia Inducible factor 1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) expression angiogenesis patient metastatic tumor over-expressing HIF-1alpha . Eligibility : Adult patient metastatic solid tumor express HIF-1alpha , standard therapy exist would likely effective , evaluate study eligibility . Due safety concern , pregnant woman HIV-infected individual exclude study . Prior enrollment , archival tumor tissue wil evaluate expression HIF-1alpha assess IHC . Only patient tumor express HIF-1alpha meet eligibility criterion enrol study . Patients ask undergo biopsy evaluate HIF-1alpha expression start treatment end treatment cycle 2 ( day 12 13 cycle 2 ) . Design : Topotecan dose 1.2 mg/m ( 2 ) administer orally daily x 5 2 week , 28 day cycle . Imaging study include CT , FDG-PET DCE-MRI perform baseline , end treatment cycle 1 ( day 9 10 ) , end treatment cycle 2 ( day 12 13 ) every 2 cycle provide information clinical response well tumor metabolism angiogenesis . The repeat scan day 9 10 cycle 1 perform solely research purpose evaluate early change tumor metabolism angiogenesis . Additional correlative study include evaluation mRNA expression HIF-1 target gene tumor tissue , circulate marker angiogenesis , measurement circulate endothelial precursor cell ( CEP ) .
