	<detailed_description>For many year , consider dogma drug biotransformation capability limit best fetus newborn increase first year life level toddler young child generally exceed adult capacity . There several situation examination clinical PK data reveal discernable pattern drug clearance attribute developmental difference drug biotransformation . It become apparent developmental difference expression among drug metabolize enzyme family ( cytochrome P450 `` CYPs '' , etc . ) Furthermore , individual drug metabolize enzyme family may unique developmental profile influence therapeutic response , desire undesired , give agent . All subject single 5 ml venous blood sample take upon admission study . All subject give single oral dose caffeine dextromethorphan . Patients allow consume normal age appropriate diet around time study drug administration sample collection period . All spontaneously void urine collect period 12 hour follow caffeine dextromethorphan administration The specific aim proposal extend current longitudinal investigation preschool age group ( 1 5 year age ) . The developmental profile CYPs , 1A2 , 2D6 , 3A4 determine caffeine dextromethorphan phenotyping procedure . The purpose study determine age/developmental stage CYP2 1A2 , 2D6 3A4 activity exceed adult activity .</detailed_description>
