	<detailed_description>Symptoms conjunctivitis ( tear , redness itching ) frequently occur patient allergic rhinitis . The pathophysiology underlie symptom remain elucidated . The symptom probably arise via combination mechanism include direct contact natural pollen conjunctiva reflex mechanism originate nose . Pollen exposure result direct hand transfer pollen conjunctiva , conceivably , forceful blow air , contain nasal secretion antigen , nasolacrimal duct . The latter mechanism would consider extremely unlikely location nasolacrimal duct inferior turbinate ( duct 's location area little pollen exposure ) considerable force air need cause reverse flow duct . The latter would also true topically apply intranasal drug reach conjunctiva via nasolacrimal duct , whereas administration medication conjunctiva frequently result medication reach nose via nasolacrimal duct . In support direct contact pollen source ocular symptom patient allergic rhinitis observation pollen wash conjunctiva windy day , although amount 10 fold less amount pollen recover simultaneously nose . Additionally , begin Noon early 1900s , subsequently show others , direct conjunctival challenge induce ocular symptom . Thus , direct contact plausible explanation , relative contribution eye symptom allergic rhinitis unknown . Since topical intranasal steroid know reduce eye symptom chance reach eye systemic absorption directly administer intranasally slim , investigator would postulate direct allergen contact conjunctiva small contributor overall ocular symptom complex . Reflex mechanism within nose show occur universally response nasal challenge antigen . Nasal challenge antigen induces reflex contralateral nasal cavity , know nasonasal reflex . This reflex also initiate nasal challenge cold , dry air histamine . The contralateral response antigen , cold dry air histamine block topical anticholinergic agent applied contralateral side , suggest efferent limb parasympathetically mediate . Histamine release side challenge antigen oral H1 antihistamine reduce contralateral response unilateral nasal allergen challenge , suggest histamine contributes initiation reflex . The eye richly innervate parasympathetic nerve enter eye run conjunction parasympathetic input nasal cavity . The investigator , therefore , hypothesize conjunctiva respond nasal allergen manner similar contralateral nasal cavity . Purpose : The investigator study whether antigen-induced nasal reflex cause eye symptom . The investigator suspect reflex occur nose eye , contribute substantially eye symptom allergic patient allergy season . The investigator propose demonstrate nasal challenge antigen lead increase lacrimation .</detailed_description>
