	<brief_summary>The study investigate effect caffeine physical performance healthy citizen age 70 year . The main hypothesis 6 mg/kg caffeine would improve cycle endurance 65 % expect maximal heart rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Caffeine Elderly Citizens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Caffeine ingestion increase endurance young people exercise 60 % -85 % maximal oxygen uptake , also seem improve endurance measure repeat sub-maximal isometric contraction decrease rate perceive exertion exercise . Although caffeine increase endurance young people , increase endurance may great interest elderly population old adult physically active lifestyle grow rapidly increase endurance fitness exercise rehabilitation program . Therefore main hypothesis caffeine would improve cycle endurance 65 % expect maximal heart rate , secondary hypothesis caffeine would improve postural stability , reaction movement time , isometric arm flexion endurance , walk speed , would reduce rate perceive exertion 5 minute cycle healthy elderly citizen .</detailed_description>
