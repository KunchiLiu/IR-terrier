	<brief_title>17-AAG Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma , Mantle Cell Lymphoma , Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine complete partial response rate time treatment failure patient relapse refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma , mantle cell lymphoma , classical Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety drug patient . II . Determine biologic effect drug select molecular target primary lymphoma cell patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease type ( anaplastic large cell lymphoma v mantle cell lymphoma vs Hodgkin 's lymphoma ) . Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) IV 1 hour day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience disease regression completion 8 course may receive 2 additional course treatment beyond maximal response . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month disease progression .</detailed_description>
