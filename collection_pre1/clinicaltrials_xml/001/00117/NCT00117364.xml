	<brief_summary>SACCHACHITIN gel , prepared waste residue fruit body Ganoderma tsugae , use previous study enhance skin wound heal animal model . In present study , effect gel activity matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) well heal skin wound human estimate clinical trial . The hypothesis regard poor heal wound over-expression MMP inhibition angiogenic factor . From previous animal study , effect SACCHACHITIN inhibit activity MMP stimulation VEGF try prove effect human wound clinical trial . Patients poorly heal wound , skin graft clinically indicate , include study . The exudate wound collected analyzed activity concentration VEGF MMP . The change heal process record . Positive result expect clinical trial patient get another choice treatment chronic wound skin grafting .</brief_summary>
