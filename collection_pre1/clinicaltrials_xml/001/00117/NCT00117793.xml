	<brief_summary>The fit residual limb within prosthetic socket primary concern many amputee . A poor fit lead skin irritation , tissue breakdown , pain . Further , amputees diabetes vascular dysfunction often difficulty maintain healthy residual limb tissue ; condition could mitigate application negative pressure ( i.e. , vacuum suspension ) . The aim research characterize residual limb response vacuum suspension system measure prosthetic performance comparison typical suction suspension system . The propose research plan involve two set human subject experiment : ( 1 ) prospective , randomize cross-over study quantify performance vacuum suspension system compare total surface bear suction socket term pistoning , maintain limb volume , step count , subjective measure fit ( 2 ) measurement transcutaneous oxygen tension function vacuum pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A proper fitting prosthetic socket provide amputee comfortable system allow pursue many desire vocational recreational goal . Unfortunately , many amputee live ill-fitting socket experience limb pistoning within socket , turn may result skin irritation , tissue breakdown , discomfort , reduction activity . One key factor affect fit intraday residual limb volume change . For amputee dysvascular condition , implication poor fit socket exacerbate poor circulation , reduce heal potential compressive force exert prosthesis . Vacuum suspension system may potential alleviate condition healthy dysvascular amputee . The purported benefit vacuum suspension system include , limited : improve suspension ( reduction amount pistoning ) , maintenance limb volume throughout day , increase tissue oxygenation residual limb . Our first objective characterize performance , relate socket fit , vacuum suspension system use objective subjective measure . We conduct within-subject experiment measure pistoning three dimension walk , overall regional change limb volume thirty-minute treadmill walk , mobility ( step count ) perception socket fit ( questionnaire ) function prosthetic prescription ( vacuum suspension system vs. total surface bear suction socket ) . Our second objective determine effect pressure within prosthetic socket residual limb transcutaneous oxygen tension ( tcpO2 ) level . We conduct laboratory-based , situ test determine transcutaneous oxygen tension level , six site residual limb , respond pressure simulate within vacuum suspension system total surface bear suction socket . The propose research allow u understand suspension system influence prosthetic socket fit residual limb tissue health formulate knowledge base two suspension system provide prosthetist clinician objective data make good prescription decision . In addition , method utilize study ( e.g. , residual limb limb volume scanner assess dynamic pistoning ) use study current novel suspension system , liner , prosthetic socket design provide standard comparison .</detailed_description>
