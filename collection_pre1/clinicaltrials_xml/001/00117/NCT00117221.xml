	<brief_summary>This study investigate spatio-temporal characteristic brain activity sleep . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study show absence external stimulus , brain continue show spatial pattern activity resemble sensory cognitive task . This phenomenon greatly affect interpretation neuroimaging study base positive emission tomography ( PET ) fMRI , rely contrast brain activity task activity rest . In addition , rest state activity may reveal information large-scale organization neuronal network functional abnormality relate disease . Participants represent broad cross section healthy adult population . Any neurologically psychiatrically healthy male nonpregnant female 18 65 year old may eligible . Studies conduct In Vivo NMR Research Center . Concurrent electroencephalogram ( EEG ) MRI study last 1 2 hour . A typical study involve 15 minute anatomical MRI scanning follow 60-minute functional scan subject relaxes eye close encouraged sleep fMRI/EEG perform . Participants may scan 1 20 time . No 1 scan perform per day 20 scan perform within year . During last 5 10 minute scan , participant open eye actively participate visual stimulation attention task . The participant 's alertness measure behavioral ( button-press ) response . The visual stimulus ( contrast reverse checkerboard display , alternate uniform grey field ) present use standard projection system available MRI scanner . The attention task involve repeat visual presentation group letter digit ; participant ask correspondence group . Magnetoencephalogram ( MEG ) scan performed participant . The precise undistorted signal available MEG use enhance interpretation alertness sleep-related characteristic EEG signal , vary quite dramatically across subject . In addition , MEG signal provide preliminary spatial localization sleep-dependent change precisely possible EEG . MRI scanner noise simulate use tape recording allow comparison MRI/EEG data . MEG scan last 45 minute 2 hour . At time brain scan participant able communicate MRI scientist MEG/EEG technician ask remove device time . The study direct benefit participant . It may help u learn brain function , may lead good treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective . The objective propose study investigate spatio-temporal characteristic brain activity sleep . A number recent fMRI ( Ogawa , Lee et al . 1990 ) study show absence external stimulus , brain continue show spatial pattern activity resemble network activate sensory cognitive task . This phenomenon greatly affect interpretation neuroimaging study base PET fMRI , since rely differential imaging activity task contrast activity rest . In addition , rest state activity potentially contain unique information large scale organization neuronal network reveals information functional abnormality relate disease process . Study Population . To avoid confound factor related disease process , subject study recruit normal adult population . In addition , subject screen sleep behavior , subject abnormal sleep behavior exclude . Design . The study design facilitate MRI detection cerebral metabolic difference sleep awake state . Wakefulness sleep , various stage classify accordance EEG criterion , consistent guideline Rechtschaffen Kales ( Rechtschaffen , 1968 ) . For purpose , optimize methodology concurrent acquisition EEG fMRI signal . Using concurrent EEG state-of-the-art MRI , plan establish precise spatial distribution change brain activity associate change sleep/wake state various stage sleep , specifically early sleep ( stage 1 2 ) . Secondly , plan investigate whether change regional brain metabolism measure MRI correlate transitory EEG phenomenon sleep , include fluctuation band-specific power , sleep spindle , K-complexes . Outcome Measure . As outcome study , atlas activity cluster normal subject establish , wake condition , well several sleep stage . Further outcomes spatial pattern covariance EEG band-specific power , spindle , K-complexes . These data serve baseline comparison activity pattern patient .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Any neurologically psychiatrically normal , male female , healthy volunteer 18 65 year old principle eligible study . Subjects must capable understanding procedure requirement study . Subjects must willing sign inform consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A subject exclude he/she contraindication MR scan follow : pregnancy , aneurysm clip ; implant neural stimulator ; implant cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator ; cochlear implant ; know absent acoustic reflex ; ocular foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving insulin pump ) preexist eye condition . Subjects underwent brain surgery , neurological lesion , psychiatric history recurrent migraine require medication also exclude study . To minimize potential confounds , subject abnormal sleep/wake pattern exclude . They report sleep problem shift work , medication could impair sleep , illegal drug tobacco . Subjects good health assess medical history , interview physical exam . Subjects ask : Refrain alcohol caffeinated product 1 day prior study ; Maintain habitual bed time wakeup time 1 week prior study . A wristworn activity monitor ( Actigraph [ R ] , Precision Control Design , Inc. , Fort Walton Beach , FL ) may use confirm compliance latter instruction . Exclusion criterion include : Sleep disorder ( report detect ) ; Psychopathology , personal firstdegree relative . ( They likely place subject risk adverse consequence relate extend wakefulness portion study ) ; Seizures head injury loss consciousness great 5 minute ; Substance dependence ( diagnosable ) ; Smoking tobacco psychotropic medication ( currently ) ; Caffeine consumption 300 mg 2 ounce alcohol regular daily consumption ; Cardiac , respiratory , medical condition may affect cerebral metabolism .</criteria>
