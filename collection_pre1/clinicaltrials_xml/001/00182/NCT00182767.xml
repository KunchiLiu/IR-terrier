	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose recommend phase II dose ixabepilone combine pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride ( HCl ) liposome ( pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride ) woman previously treat advanced ovarian epithelial , primary peritoneal cavity , fallopian tube cancer metastatic breast cancer . II . To determine safety profile regimen patient . III . To determine clinical efficacy regimen patient platinum- taxane-resistant advanced ovarian epithelial , primary peritoneal cavity , fallopian tube cancer . OUTLINE : This phase I , multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study ixabepilone follow phase II study . Patients receive ixabepilone intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21-28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
