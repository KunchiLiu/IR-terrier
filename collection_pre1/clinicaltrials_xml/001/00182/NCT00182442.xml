	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia chronic , debilitate psychiatric disorder complex clinical presentation , partially responsiveness treatment vary outcome . Though modern anti-psychotic drug use treat illness past 50 year , consistently observe significant proportion people diagnose schizophrenia respond adequately medication . Even among people show symptomatic improvement , benefit translate improve functioning real life set . Research past 10 year reveal two significant finding : 1 ) know proportion people schizophrenia neurocognitive deficit part clinical profile . Neuro-cognitive deficit refer impairment attention , concentration , memory , use language , decision making subtle aspect judgment . 2 ) Traditional antipsychotic drug useful improve neurocognitive deficit , claim make novel antipsychotic drug ( Quetiapine , Olanzapine Risperidone ) may beneficial effect improve neurocognitive deficit associate schizophrenia . In early investigation , noticed Quetiapine produce clinically significant improvement neurocognitive deficit compare antipsychotic drug ; two additional report confirm distinctive advantage Quetiapine . Based preliminary result , present study design address follow question . 1 ) To examine whether neurocognitive deficit associate schizophrenia impact community function quality life individual affect illness , 2 ) whether Quetiapine ( Seroquel ) significantly effective Olanzapine ( Zyprexa ) improve neurocognitive deficit , community functioning quality life . The study sample include total 120 patient diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder , require antipsychotic drug treatment . The sample size calculation base expect difference two compare medication , term ability improve neurocognitive cluster score PANSS ( Positive negative symptom scale ) detect earlier study.The study design prospective double-blind , randomize control trial , use Quetiapine Olanzapine drug comparison . Eligible participant undergo baseline clinical neurocognitive evaluation randomly assign receive either Quetiapine Olanzapine treatment . Both patient control blind nature medication prescribed . However , clinician flexibility increase dose clinically appropriate . The goal achieve symptom stability monitor progress community functioning , change perceive quality life . The participant continue medication least period one year , outcome evaluation perform 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month point . These include re-assessment clinical symptom neurocognitive deficit community functioning , use appropriate measurement tool .</detailed_description>
