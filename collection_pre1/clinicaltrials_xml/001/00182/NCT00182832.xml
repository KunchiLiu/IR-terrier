	<detailed_description>A grow body evidence demonstrate old patient cognitive impairment ( CI ) hospitalize management medical illness especially vulnerable hospital acquire complication fall , injury , pressure ulcer , restraint , delirium . These complication contribute mortality , poor functional status , limited rehabilitation , prolong length stay , increase institutionalization , high health care cost . Evidence suggest interdisciplinary geriatric inpatient service improve care hospitalize old adult without CI ; however , effectiveness among old adult CI less clear . One reason may ever-quickening pace care hospital set . Thus , match geriatric evaluation recommendation true pace hospital care may one mechanism improve care old adult CI . A recent report Institute Medicine suggest integrate information technology ( IT ) health care best route improve overall safety quality health care system . The hypothesis study miss , delay , post-hoc , incomplete implementation geriatric service-based recommendation significant factor explain poor outcome among hospitalized old adult cognitive impairment ( CI ) . Wishard Memorial Hospital 's physician already use Computerized Decision Support System ( CDSS ) , develop Regenstrief Institute , guide medical service . For study , content CDSS modify special need old adult CI . A major advantage system reduce time implementation geriatric recommendation specific focus prevent initiation potentially harmful medication procedure critical first 48 hour hospitalization . A total 400 patient cognitive impairment hospitalize medical ward recruit study . Patients randomize receive either standard care proactive screen program CI combine modify CDSS . The electronic medical record patient review prescription potentially inappropriate medication , urinary catheter , physical restraint first 24 hour entire hospital stay . Medical record use determine total number hospital acquire complication may relate CI ; include fall , injury pull IV line urinary catheter , pressure ulcer , new-onset delirium episode develop hospitalization . Also , time elapse screen CI physician order geriatric consultation calculate use electronic medical record .</detailed_description>
