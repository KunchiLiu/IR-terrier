	<detailed_description>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 1 . SPECIFIC AIM 1 : To assess efficacy sertraline prevent posttraumatic stress disorder child age 6-20 burn , injury reconstructive surgery follow burn injury . 2 . SPECIFIC AIM 2 : To assess efficacy sertraline prevent co-morbid depression child age 6-20 burn , injury reconstructive surgery follow burn injury . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Prevention posttraumatic stress symptom priority psychiatric practice today . This first control study medication prevent posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) child adolescent . The purpose study use sertraline prevent PTSD co-morbid depression develop 6-20 year old child hospitalize burn , injury , reconstructive surgery follow burn injury . If intervention successful , help prevent psychiatric developmental disorder injured child well undergo reconstructive procedure . While found study investigate efficacy sertraline treat PTSD child adolescent , research indicate sertraline effective treat anxiety disorder depression child adolescent . Research also indicate sertraline effective treat PTSD adult . RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES Families child age 6-20 admitted acute burn reconstructive surgery contact study staff within 3 day admission medically stable , ask participate study . In addition , 6-17 year old patient admit injury ask participate . CONSENT PROCEDURES : A licensed physician investigator explain nature study request consent child 's primary caregiver legal guardian soon possible hospital admission . Once consent give , research coordinator obtain baseline data . Ninety child enrol study . These child must ) burn patient age 6 20 injured patient age 6-17 , b ) respond burn , injury , surgery fear , helplessness , horror , c ) proficient English Spanish . If child memory injury , currently use antidepressant , know sensitivity sertraline , diagnosis Bipolar disorder , diagnosis PTSD , mental retardation , Traumatic Brain Injury , new onset seizure mark worsening seizure disorder , he/she include study . STUDY PROCEDURES After child enrol , he/she randomly assign receive either sertraline placebo . Neither family investigator know group child assign . If time information become medically necessary , make available child 's doctor . The child take study medication every day 12 week . If child sertraline group , dose medication may increase gradually satisfactory response achieve . If child placebo group , he/she may receive sertraline 12 week clinically indicate . After 12 week , medication placebo taper rate 25 mg every three day . All child family assess six point : Early acute hospitalization ( Baseline ) , week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 . The baseline follow-up assessment 8 , 12 , 24 week include child parent interview . During assessment , child parent complete several questionnaire examine child functioning . Check assessment complete recommended FDA . The assessment take place hospital , home , telephone child discharge . EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS Proficiency English Spanish need order include study study instrument validate non-English non-Spanish speaking population . PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY Parents/guardians inform information gather study confidential adversely affect child 's treatment way . The child assign research identification number number , name , place study questionnaire . The document match name identification number keep locked cabinet accessible study staff . The data store computer password protect computer access limit study staff . All interview questionnaire data keep locked cabinet . Families also tell prior enter study certain information ( i.e. , suspicion child abuse neglect ) confidential . EXPECTED BENEFITS The child 's psychiatric symptom may potentially decrease result take sertraline . If sertraline find prevent PTSD , patient child benefit use . In addition , child may benefit on-going psychological follow-up course 24-weeks . At conclusion study , family opportunity meet one investigator discuss result evaluation . Potential benefit society : This study may helpful scientifically understanding effect sertraline child 's psychological physiological response stress . It may satisfy family learn contribute body knowledge may help children/adolescents burn injured way . It hope sertraline help prevent debilitate symptom PTSD among burn injured child adolescent . Because PTSD long-lasting impact develop brain well functional development , successful prevention development symptom would far-reaching beneficial implication child suffer burn injury , well suffer form physical psychological trauma . FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS Sertraline show well tolerated child adolescent . Its side effect may include nausea , headache , stomach distress , diarrhea , dry mouth , insomnia , sexual dysfunction , sleepiness , dizziness , tremor , fatigue . Most side effect appear early treatment , 10 % people lead stop treatment . After taper sertraline , side effect gradually stop also . Because drug affect nervous system affect judgment , think coordination , subject warn cautious operate hazardous machinery , include automobile , reasonable certainty subject affect adversely drug treatment . We ask subject avoid alcoholic beverage study . It possible combination alcohol medication may cause unknown side effect . Use illegal drug prohibit . Stopping medication abruptly may dangerous , hence , inform subject gradual decrease medication dose necessary medication discontinuation . The risk suddenly stop mediation include possibility nausea , malaise , muscle ache , headache , mood change , unusual sensation ( numbness tingling ) . Subjects contact investigator discontinue medication . If side effect medication uncomfortable remain , sertraline may decrease , taper stop , alternative treatment offer , include counsel and/or alternative medication . If subject remains distressed , doctor available help long subject hospital . If , subject leave hospital need treatment , study doctor refer him/her mental health professional community . If study subject becomes distress , he/she opportunity call evaluate study staff . Individuals bipolar disorder ( manic-depressive illness ) participate study risk induce mania hypomania anti-depressants . Due potential fatal interaction , subject avoid take monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOIs ) within least 30 day take sertraline , avoid start MAOI treatment least 30 day discontinuation treatment sertraline . Subjects may experience allergic reaction sertraline , placebo ingredient . If subject experience allergy symptom rash , hive itch , he/she notify doctor immediately . Untreated allergy symptom lead medical emergency . Since research study treatment procedure relatively new , may additional risk side effect know time , might occur study later . Subjects inform significant new information regard sertraline may affect willingness continue participation study . If subject plan take drug study medication undergo medical treatment , ask notify study doctor start drug treatment . This apply prescription drug , over-the-counter drug cough cold remedy , antacid , investigational drugs/procedures , sleep medication . If surgery diagnostic procedure plan , study doctor notify procedure perform . Pregnant woman nurse mother participate study . It important subject avoid pregnancy throughout study use drug pregnancy potential harm embryo fetus . We instruct woman childbearing potential must reliably practice approve form birth control participate study . If subject become pregnant , must tell study doctor immediately . Her participation study may end may need counsel pregnancy . If subject becomes pregnant study 15 day last dose medication pregnancy carry term , investigator ask permission follow course pregnancy delivery well condition newborn . If subject miss period think might pregnant study , must notify study doctor immediately withdrawn study . MINIMIZATION OF RISKS AND SAFETY MONITORING Source data monitor co-investigators study . Safety outcomes monitor conduct accord rule regulation Massachusetts General Hospital .
