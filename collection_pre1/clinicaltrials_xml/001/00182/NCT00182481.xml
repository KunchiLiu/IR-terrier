	<detailed_description>Airway inflammation important component asthma . It influence component include symptom airway functional ( physiological ) measurement . It primary target treatment . However , correlate closely symptom , need symptomatic bronchodilator relief , physiological abnormality . Furthermore , different type . As result , physician poor recognize presence type . This important eosinophilic inflammation responsive corticosteroid non-eosinophilic responsive . The comprehensive non-invasive relatively non-invasive measurement airway inflammation spontaneous induce sputum cell count . These reliable , valid responsive , quality good measurement . They might therefore clinically useful guide individual treatment . In present study investigate issue . We compare use , comparison use symptom spirometry , prevent exacerbation asthma . We choose prevention exacerbation important clinical outcome great impact patient â€™ quality life , morbidity healthcare utilization . The study comprise two Phases . In Phase 1 , minimum treatment control sputum eosinophilia ( well clinical criterion ) Sputum Strategy , clinical criterion Clinical Strategy , establish . In Phase 2 , minimum treatment maintain patient see every 3 momths exacerbation . The primary outcome relative risk reduction occurrence first exacerbation length time without exacerbation 18-20 month Phase 2 study .</detailed_description>
