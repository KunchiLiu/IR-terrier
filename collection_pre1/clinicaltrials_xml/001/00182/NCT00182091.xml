	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect growth hormone ( GH ) replacement men woman history acromegaly growth hormone deficient . We compare person history acromegaly normal GH level . Acromegaly result area brain , call pituitary , produce much growth hormone . When individual cure acromegaly , growth hormone level may normal low ( GH deficiency ) . Growth hormone deficiency mean body longer produce much growth hormone pituitary/hypothalamic region damage tumor treatment receive . We study effect growth hormone replacement health heart blood vessel GH deficient person look see therapy : 1. effect cardiovascular risk marker ( special blood test indicate healthy heart artery ) 2. affect stiffness artery 3. affect heart rate capacity heart respond change body position 4. different effect depend whether take estrogen / testosterone . We assess measure health one occasion person cure acromegaly normal GH level person cure acromegaly GH deficiency contraindication receive GH . GH deficient individual contraindication receive GH , participate study 12 month . Individuals normal GH level , GH deficient contraindication receive GH , ask return one visit ( without intervention ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate effect physiologic growth hormone ( GH ) replacement cardiovascular risk marker , cardiac autonomic function , arterial distensibility , body composition , quality life men woman GH deficiency follow treatment acromegaly . We hypothesize population represent newly identify group patient GH replacement benefit . Treatment modality acromegaly include transsphenoidal surgery radiation therapy , result hypopituitarism . A significant subset cure acromegalics therefore develop pituitary hormone deficiency . Although replacement adrenal , thyroid gonadal hormone routine practice , clinician replace GH subgroup , even profoundly GH deficient subject , randomize study prove benefit population . With accumulation evidence beneficial effect GH replacement , therapy become standard care subject GH deficiency ( GHD ) , except acromegaly subgroup GH traditionally withhold . The GHD syndrome manifest increase cardiovascular risk , potentially reversible GH therapy . Cardiovascular disease lead cause death acromegalics . Although cure acromegaly associate reduction mortality attributable GH excess , GHD may contribute factor cardiovascular morbidity mortality group patient , patient pituitary tumor . It therefore crucial determine cure acromegalics hypopituitarism affect GHD syndrome , essential study particular population respond GH therapy . Because patient typically large macroadenomas treat surgery radiation therapy , long-term management hypopituitarism critical . As endocrine disorder , goal therapy normal hormone replacement , take patient state hormone excess one permanent hormone deficiency . Cardiovascular status acromegaly Acromegaly associate 2-3 fold increase mortality compare general population . GH excess recognize multiple effect heart cardiovascular system . GH excess affect cardiovascular health indirectly increase prevalence cardiovascular risk factor include hypertension , insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes , dyslipidemia . In addition , endothelial dysfunction prevalent acromegaly normal control . Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation exaggerate sympathetic-mediated vasoconstrictor response recently describe acromegalic patient . Although flow-mediated dilatation show improve cured acromegalics , show return normal . Reports prevalence increase carotid intima-media thickness ( IMT ) conflicting . Some study document increase IMT active acromegaly . A specific acromegaly-related cardiomyopathy -- independent hypertension , diabetes dyslipidemia -- extensively describe . Impairment ejection fraction physical activity observe 73 % patient , may lead exercise intolerance . Morphological functional cardiac change reverse normalize GH/IGF-I level . Although ventricular hypertrophy show regress , unclear proportion patient recover normal ventricular mass . Several echocardiographic study show control disease activity diastolic filling improve , effect ejection fraction exercise tolerance variable . Data reversibility cardiovascular disease acromegaly heterogeneous due evolve definition cure acromegaly , often short duration study , vary duration disease activity , difference gender gonadal status , well possible distinct effect somatostatin analogs heart vessel . Dysrhythmias also common acromegaly control . Some study show permanent myocardial scarring may occur . In propose study population sequelae previous GH excess may coexist manifestation GH deficiency . Cardiovascular status GHD Cardiovascular morbidity mortality adult GHD show increase number retrospective study . Increased arterial IMT , increase prevalence atherosclerotic plaque endothelial dysfunction report GH deficient adult childhood adulthood onset form . The GHD syndrome characterize cluster factor associate increase cardiovascular risk , central adiposity , increase visceral fat , insulin resistance , dyslipoproteinemia decrease plasma fibrinolytic activity . GH administration beneficial effect number factor , unknown mechanism implicate GH action process atherosclerosis . In addition alteration atherosclerotic marker , abnormality cardiac function structure report among patient GHD , possibly contribute increase cardiovascular mortality . GHD also associate cardiac autonomic dysfunction may contribute cardiovascular mortality improve GH replacement therapy . Of particular importance regard patient acromegaly , show twelve month GH replacement improve leave ventricular mass cardiac performance young adult GHD . Therefore , hypopituitary patient history acromegaly GH deficient may particularly good candidate benefit physiologic GH replacement . Adipose tissue receptor GH , lipolytic activity . A decrease central fat assess waist-to-hip ratio report study , others . Consequences increase abdominal adiposity include increase risk cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes cerebrovascular disease . Long-term GH treatment decrease total body fat include visceral fat . Lean body mass muscle function improve GH therapy adult GHD . GH increase lean body mass decrease adipose tissue mass give adult GHD elderly . Administration GH cause insulin resistance acutely long-term therapy may restore glucose sensitivity effect body composition . GH treatment increase lipoprotein ( ) ( Lp ( ) ) level effect lipoprotein still controversial . Some study report decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL ) without increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL ) GH administration , others . Key factor likely involved discrepant finding include heterogeneity patient study term age onset GHD ( childhood versus adulthood ) , gender , severity GHD methodological issue dose duration GH administration . In addition , many study control period . There decrease hepatic expression LDL receptor GHD , reverse GH therapy . This phenomenon could link exaggerated postprandial increase triglycerides-rich particle observe GHD , also normalized administration GH . Inflammation play central role pathophysiology atherosclerosis . Each atherosclerotic lesion represent different stage chronic inflammatory process arterial wall , different marker along inflammatory cascade report predict cardiovascular risk . Among , high-sensitivity test C-reactive protein ( CRP ) one best validate . Several prospective study support strong link level CRP future risk coronary event . CRP add considerable value total HDL cholesterol measurement prediction cardiovascular risk . These distal marker reflect consequence elevate proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . GH know important immunomodulatory effect . We therefore hypothesize effect GH process atherosclerosis might mediate cytokine-inflammatory pathway . We recently investigate effect physiologic GH replacement cardiovascular risk marker men GHD . In study find CRP IL-6 level decrease GH treat men compare control despite significant change serum lipid level . Other emerge inflammatory marker include intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , P-selectin CD 40 ligand ( CD40L ) , think reflect platelet activation may promote atheromatous plaque destabilization . Myeloperoxidase recently show predict early risk myocardial infarction risk major adverse cardiac event follow six month . And lately placental growth factor ( PlGF ) find independent marker adverse outcome patient acute coronary syndrome . The effect GH-IGF-I axis marker unknown . We also recently investigate level inflammatory marker woman hypopituitarism compare healthy control . We find woman hypopituitarism increase level IL-6 CRP , suggest chronic inflammation may involve pathogenesis atherosclerosis population . In addition inflammatory marker , thrombogenic cardiovascular risk marker fibrinogen , tissue-type plasminogen activator ( tPA ) plasminogen activator-inhibitor 1 ( PAI-1 ) think surrogate marker vascular health . It critical determine whether physiologic GH replacement beneficial effect patient history acromegaly , define influence GH gonadal status risk factor . Quality life show poor GH deficient female treat acromegaly female cause GHD . Short-term GH replacement cause non-significant improvement quality life score subject GHD follow cure acromegaly , effect longer GH treatment duration publish specific subgroup . Our study provide data quality life subject follow cure acromegaly ( GH deficient versus GH sufficient ) effect GH therapy GH deficient group . Data body composition cardiovascular risk marker patient cure acromegaly rare . No study yet publish compare endpoint GH sufficient GH deficient subject history acromegaly . Our hypothesis GH sufficient subject favorable profile GH deficient subject . Several study show normalization mortality rate subject cure acromegaly compare subject active acromegaly . However demonstrated improvement mediate normalization cardiovascular risk factor . Collecting cross-sectional data patient population may contribute answer question .</detailed_description>
