	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Octreotide may effective treatment malignant ascites . It yet know whether octreotide effective placebo treat malignant ascites . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study octreotide see well work compare placebo treat patient cancer-related malignant ascites .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Octreotide Treating Patients With Cancer-Related Malignant Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare efficacy octreotide vs placebo , term extend time-to-paracentesis , patient cancer-related symptomatic malignant ascites . Secondary - Compare number paracenteses patient treat drug . - Determine toxicity octreotide patient . - Compare quality life patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord anticipated ongoing chemotherapy ( yes v ) , frequency prior paracentesis ( never v ) , prior chemotherapy ( never vs first-line chemotherapy v second-line chemotherapy v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive octreotide subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive placebo SC day 1 . In arm , treatment intramuscular octreotide placebo repeat monthly 2 year absence unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , 2 week , monthly 2 year study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
