	<brief_summary>The prognosis patient large rotator cuff tear poor . This recently develop biologic scaffold provide numerous structural functional property may direct cell growth aid tendon heal . To date , randomize clinical trial assess effectiveness patch augment repair large rotator cuff tear . We propose study compare rate repair failure , quality life , function , pain , range motion 60 patient large rotator cuff . Patients randomize ( like flip coin ) undergo standard rotator cuff repair without augmentation SIS . Patients assess 6 week , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month post-operative</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An RCT Compare Outcomes Patients With Large Rotator Cuff Repair That Undergo Repair With Without SIS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective full randomize trial To compare effectiveness standardize method rotator cuff repair without augmentation use porcine small intestine submucosa ( SIS ) patient large rotator cuff tear . Objectives pilot study 1 . To obtain preliminary estimate likely success SIS . 2 . To formally evaluate ability successfully recruit eligible patient study . 3 . To determine appropriate length follow examination pattern incremental improvement stabilization quality life time follow rotator cuff repair . 4 . To determine accurate estimation sample size full trial use quality life . 5 . To determine frequency surgeon comply surgical protocol . 6 . To determine frequency patient physiotherapists comply suggest physiotherapy protocol .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients large rotator cuff tear ( Type 1B Type 2 ) determine clinical examination diagnostic imaging . Criteria describe Harryman et al ( 1991 ) guide classification rotator cuff tear define reassessed time surgery ( Type 0 = intact cuff , Type 1A = thin cuff partial thickness defect , Type 1B= full thickness defect one tendon , Type 2 = full thickness defect two tendon , Type 3 = full thickness defect three tendon ) . Previous shoulder surgery , exclude acromioplasty diagnostic arthroscopy . Inability surgeon repair tear remain defect great 10mm diameter , Inability surgeon repair tear less 1cm medialization , Evidence significant shoulder pathology include , Type IIIV SLAP lesion , Bankart lesion , Hill Sachs lesion , Grade III osteoarthritis ) . Active joint systemic infection , Significant muscle paralysis shoulder girdle , Major medical illness would preclude undergoing surgery , Patients unwilling unable assess accord study protocol one year follow surgery Major psychiatric illness , developmental handicap inability read understand English language</criteria>
