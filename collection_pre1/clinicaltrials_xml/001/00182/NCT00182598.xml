	<brief_title>Applying Web Technology Buprenorphine Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The partial opioid agonist , buprenorphine , recently approve FDA treatment opioid-dependence available via physician prescription , enable greatly need expansion access opioid treatment service . However , physician , considerable demand time , likely unable provide coordinate referral opioid-dependent patient receive supplemental educational intervention critical success treatment . To address challenge , develop interactive , web-based patient education system opioid-dependent individual office-based buprenorphine treatment . In system , plan provide patient educational intervention demonstrate efficacy ( e.g. , information buprenorphine , HIV/AIDS education , relapse prevention skill train ) . In Phase I , demonstrate scientific , technical commercial merit feasibility web-based patient education system develop several module program well appropriate technology program deliver office-based setting . We subsequently assess module context feedback session conduct opioid-dependent individual lab design mimic technical constraint physician 's office . Results demonstrate system represent viable approach patient education office-based buprenorphine treatment . During Phase II , plan complete research development effort project . We complete educational module system . We also develop `` customization program '' patient use help identify optimal order may access program module treatment . Additionally , establish electronic reporting system provide physician prescribe buprenorphine patient activity report , enable track document patient progress system ensure patient compliant ancillary educational intervention . Additionally , plan conduct randomize , control trial evaluate efficacy cost-effectiveness patient education system deliver via Internet compare delivery patient educational service community-based treatment facility outside office-based setting . This system provide patient , physician large community assurance patient office-based buprenorphine treatment receive ancillary service along medication , thereby improve likelihood successful treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
