	<detailed_description>GERD encompass variety symptom pathological finding cause reflux gastric content esophagus although symptom pathology may occur independently . GERD usually present typical symptom retrosternal burning ( heartburn ) without chest pain regurgitation gastric content back mouth . However , symptom often occur absence abnormality associate GERD , esophageal erosion , ulceration , stricturing Barrett 's esophagus . There clear correlation symptom histological feature GERD . Less prevalent manifestation GERD include genesis dental erosion respiratory disease include aspiration pneumonia , asthma , chronic laryngitis . Most often , GERD due excessive reflux gastric content esophagus rather gastric acid hypersecretion . Reflux cause increase frequency inappropriate transient relaxation low esophageal sphincter ( LES ) . In patient , basal rest LES pressure normal although LES hypotonia , reduce esophageal body contractility presence hiatus hernia may exacerbate reflux reduce esophageal clearance . Impaired esophageal mucosal resistance increase potential esophageal damage . Bile acids pancreatic enzyme implicate pathogenesis GERD generally accept major cause esophageal symptoms injury gastric acid pepsin , active low ambient pH . Severity esophagitis reflux symptom correlate well duration esophageal acid exposure clear correlation acid secretory inhibition esophagitis heal rate give drug . On basis , treatment GERD direct towards : Minimization potential precipitating factor lifestyle modification weight loss , small meal , avoidance alcohol tobacco . Improving LES pressure , esophageal clearance gastric emptying , use prokinetic agent . Neutralization acid stomach esophagus , use antacid . Reduction acid secretion , use histamine receptor antagonist ( H2RAs ) PPI 's . Surgical prevention gastro-esophageal reflux fundoplication . In practice , latter two approach successful patient severe GERD PPI 's proven efficacious H2RAs .</detailed_description>
