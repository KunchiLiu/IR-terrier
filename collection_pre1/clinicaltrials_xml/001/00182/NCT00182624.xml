	<brief_summary>This study determine whether scan prostate use special magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique detect prostate cancer great accuracy method . MRI use strong magnet radio wave produce image body tissue . Unlike many cancer , prostate cancer difficult see image study like x-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , conventional MRI scan . This study use magnet twice strong magnet commonly use MRI test . Patients 18 year age old prostate cancer confirm prostate biopsy may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , review pathology report . Participants undergo MRI prostate possibly biopsy prostate gland , follow : Prostate MRI Before come NIH Clinical Center biopsy , patient take Fleets enema empty rectum fecal matter . For MRI , endorectal coil ( tube contain specially design antenna ) place rectum , behind prostate . The coil increase amount signal receive MRI unit . Additional coil may wrap around pelvis improve quality scan . The patient lie stretcher move scanner . A catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm vein injection contrast agent call gadolinium , brighten image . Patients may also ask breathe oxygen-rich gas mask scan test use oxygen contrast agent MRI . Patients may ask repeat MRI test reproducibility procedure . The repeat test optional . Prostate Biopsy Depending MRI finding , patient may ask undergo prostate biopsy obtain sample tumor tissue . The tissue obtain needle place rectum . Medicines may use reduce pain biopsy reduce chance infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Progress effective local therapy prostate cancer stymie lack imaging technique capable reliably identify location cancer within prostate . Magnetic Resonance Imaging promise candidate image prostate high soft tissue contrast , multiplanar capability , potential providing unique biologic information available modality . In addition conventional T2-weighted imaging MRI technique provide unique biologic information include MR spectroscopy , diffusion weight MRI , dynamic enhance MRI hypoxia image . All show promise image tumor magnetic field strength 1.5 Tesla limited sensitivity . Since MR signal proportional magnetic field strength , 3.0 Tesla clinical system potentially could improve overall diagnostic accuracy . A comprehensive imaging package incorporate technique study prostate cancer state-of-the-art 3.0 Tesla magnet yet develop . In pilot study seek develop evaluate comprehensive prostate MR exam 3.0 Tesla . Patients biopsy proven prostate cancer undergo MRI endorectal surface phase array coil include conventional sequence , MR spectroscopy , Diffusion weight MRI , Dynamic enhance MR Hypoxia image . In development phase trial ( 30 patient ) , robustness technique test-retest reproducibility evaluate . In second phase , comprehensive prostate MRI exam validate result prostate biopsy ( 50 patient ) . The expected accrual period two year . We hope method offer prostate cancer patient accurate method localize prostate cancer possible improve outcome minimize complication treatment .</detailed_description>
