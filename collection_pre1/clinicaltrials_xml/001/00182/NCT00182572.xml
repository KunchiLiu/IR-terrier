	<detailed_description>Adolescents increasingly abuse become dependent heroin opioids . The number emergency room visit relate heroin among 12-17 year old rise almost 600 % , self-reported prevalence heroin use among group double last decade . As result increase availability high-potency , low-cost heroin , many adolescent initiate heroin use snorting ; however , many often progress injection heroin . Despite critical need identify efficacious treatment population , virtually research conduct systematically characterize evaluate treatment intervention adolescent heroin opioid abuser . We recently conduct first control study fund NIDA systematically evaluate efficacy several pharmacotherapies detoxification agent along intensive behavioral intervention treatment population . The purpose study evaluate way improve promise outcomes initial study via combined behavioral-buprenorphine treatment opioid-dependent youth . The primary aim examine improve treatment outcome achieve duration buprenorphine detoxification lengthen ( rate decrease buprenorphine dose slow , withdrawal symptom may reduce intensity youth provide great opportunity learn new skill behavior address might best discontinue opiate use , prevent relapse , meet treatment goal ) . A secondary aim examine provision monetary voucher-based incentive contingent consumption opioid antagonist , naltrexone , reduce rate relapse opiate use adolescent post-detoxification compare incentive provide . This analysis may provide critical empirical information regard best prevent relapse opioid use among opioid-dependent youth . Another secondary aim identify significant predictor treatment outcome . We thus conduct exploratory evaluation demographic , baseline drug use , psychological history variable may predict successful treatment outcomes . This work may help inform refinement treatment intervention various sub-populations opioid-dependent youth . Outcome measure include opiate drug abstinence , retention , opiate withdrawal symptom , HIV risk behavior , family relationship , well variety secondary outcome measure . We plan collect measure intake , treatment several post-treatment follow-up timepoints . Overall , research contribute new empirical information inform development effective treatment intervention largely unstudied rapidly expand population opioid-dependent youth .</detailed_description>
