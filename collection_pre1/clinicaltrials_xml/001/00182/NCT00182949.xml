	<brief_summary>Background : - The island Sardinia , Italian region , population highly interrelate . Researchers develop SardiNIA longitudinal study examine possible genetic factor predispose individual diseases various inherited condition . In study , participant draw four town Ogliastra region ( Lanusei , Ilbono , Elini , Arzana ) , DNA analyze compare long-term assessment various health-related event . The SardiNIA study design improve understand genetic factor involve age-associated disease disorder , provide possible point intervention may help prevent disease . Objectives : - To conduct long-term study genetics epidemiology small highly interrelated population . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age ( least 14 year age Phase 1 study ) live province Ogliastra eastern Sardinia . Design : - This 10-year study involve three phase : collect initial blood sample medical history ( year 1 4 ) , two set follow-up visit collect additional data ( 3 year apart ) . - Participants provide detailed medical history information long-term study , primarily involve follow aspect : - Demographic/family clinical variable ( e.g. , medication , fertility , hospitalization surgical procedure , age relative still alive , age cause death decease relative ) ( Phase 1 ) - Complete physical examination , include measure height weight , blood pressure , basic heart function ( Phase 1 ) - Blood urine sample ( Phase 1 ) - Heart lung function test ( Phase 1 ) - Assessment general personality traits possible history depression ( Phase 1 ) - Dietary assessment food frequency questionnaire ( Phase 1 ) - Cognitive test attention , memory , concentration ( Phases 1 2 ) - Frailty-related test ( e.g. , hand grip strength , walk speed , bone strength ) ( Phases 1 2 ) - Eye examination test evidence disease macular degeneration ( Phases 1 2 ) - Kidney thyroid ultrasound ( Phases 1 , 2 , 3 )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The 1,500,000 people island Sardinia arose much small number , start thousand year ago , little immigration outside entire period . SardiNIA longitudinal study design assumption highly interrelated population , Sardinians , discover genetic factor predispose individual disease physiological characteristic easier cost-effective . Thus far , group 6,148 participant cluster 4 town Ogliastra region ( Lanusei , Ilbono , Elini , Arzana ) assess 100 quantitative trait , include range trait relate heart disease , feature personality , frailty , cognition several blood test ( see Table 1 ) . The DNA participant analyze ( genotyped ) look variant gene involve determine trait . Up , least one gene discover trait , include gene specific level uric acid , fetal hemoglobin , cholesterol , etc . The analysis gene continue , extend additional trait In addition , improve longitudinal perspective study , participant follow detect development new health-related event outcomes . This do 3 way : 1 ) look genetic factor determine rate change level trait like blood pressure age , base repeat measure currently ongoing second visit plan third visit ; 2 ) see participant contract particular disease , test whether gene discover affect risk factor help predict related health problem ; 3 ) compare DNA disease-free participant study DNA Sardinian patient affect particular disease , see gene already find additional one uncover comparison involve disease By look development outcome , SardiNIA project ( call ProgeNIA population ) improve understanding genetic factor involve age-associated disease disorder . Those gene may provide possible point intervention may yield route prevention disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The targeted region study , Ogliastra , isolate population 300,000 area enclose two mountain range sea . We recruit 8,500 resident towns Lanusei ( capital region ) , Arzana , Elini Ilbono , independent health status . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : At baseline , individual le 14 year age exclude study enrollment . Over follow visit , individual 18 evaluate .</criteria>
