	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy During Surgery Treating Older Women With Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine feasibility intraoperative partial breast radiotherapy prior surgical resection old woman low-risk early stage primary invasive ductal carcinoma breast . - Determine rate good/excellent cosmesis , measure RTOG cosmetic rating scale , patient treat regimen . - Compare cosmetic outcome patient treat regimen patient treat partial breast brachytherapy clinical trial RTOG-9517 . - Determine incidence grade 3-4 toxicity regimen patient . - Determine rate ipsilateral breast recurrence , include recurrence within tumor bed compare elsewhere breast , patient treat regimen . Secondary - Determine radiation-induced activation receptor signal transduction pathway involve radiation response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This non-randomized study . Patients undergo intraoperative lymphatic mapping sentinel lymphadenectomy OR standard level I , II axillary dissection evaluate lymph node follow intraoperative breast ultrasonography define tumor target volume . Patients undergo intraoperative single-dose partial breast radiotherapy follow segmental mastectomy ( i.e. , lumpectomy ) tumor . Patients 1 2 tumor-involved surgical margin may undergo repeat segmental mastectomy . Patients &gt; 2 tumor-involved surgical margin undergo mastectomy . Patients determine tumor size &gt; 3 cm extensive intraductal component final pathology evaluation undergo standard external beam radiotherapy surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 71 patient accrue study within 2 3 year .</detailed_description>
