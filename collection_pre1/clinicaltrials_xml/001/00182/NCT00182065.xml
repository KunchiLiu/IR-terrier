	<brief_summary>Heart failure common elderly , may lead functional intellectual problem . Functional problem include loss ability perform basic task daily live bath dress . No study yet describe rate heart failure cause problem develop . This study aim find whether nursing home patient deteriorate quickly respect function intellect heart failure . Participants undergo thorough health history physical examination follow every 3 month year . Over 30 nursing home Kitchener , Waterloo , Cambridge , Hamilton , South Central Ontario ( Canada ) , participate study . Every 3 month , participant review respect function , intellect , mood behaviour . Results heart failure compare people without heart failure . The result study used plan study see whether good treatment heart failure preserve function , intellect , prevent depression mood problem .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heart Failure , Functional Cognitive Decline , Psychiatric Symptoms Nursing Home Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence Heart Failure ( HF ) rising , primarily among elderly . HF diagnose 15 30 % elderly resident long-term care facility ( LTCF ) . HF associate high mortality rate common reason elderly person hospitalize . The economic impact HF substantial . Despite advance management HF , elderly less likely receive recommend therapy . This may reflect under-representation frail elderly clinical trial HF treatment . The elderly likely experience adverse effect . In addition , HF trial focus mortality hospitalization outcome measure , may less relevant frail elderly may concern prevent disability preserve cognition . Recent study demonstrate association functional decline , cognitive impairment HF . Functional decline define loss ability independently perform basic activity self-care . In addition , patient HF may likely suffer behavioural psychological difficulty without HF . The primary hypothesis study elderly resident LTCF history HF experience rapid rate functional decline resident without history . The secondary hypothesis elderly resident LTCF HF also experience rapid rate cognitive decline great burden associate behavioural psychological symptom . We propose conduct prospective cohort study 25 LTCF Hamilton , 9 LTCF Kitchener-Waterloo , 7 LTCF Cambridge , Ontario . All newly admit resident facility consider inclusion . Residents consent obtain expect survive eight week due underlying malignancy , end-stage neurological illness palliative diagnosis exclude . Approximately 600 patient recruit , 20 % expect history HF . Residents consent obtain assess research nurse . The assessment consist standardized history physical examination , review pertinent medical record , assessment function ( Barthel Index ) , cognition ( MDS-COGS ) , neuropsychiatric symptom ( Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory Neuropsychiatric Inventory ) . These measurement obtain baseline every three month thereafter year . The diagnosis HF confirm two specialist use standard criterion . Residents history HF compare without history . Mortality , emergency room visit , acute hospitalization , fall measure . Thus far , study prospectively examine functional cognitive decline LTCF resident HF . No study examine relationship HF psychological behavioural symptom patient . As elderly resident LTCF represent frail frail elderly , result study likely generalizable frail elderly community . We hope apply result study future research aim determine whether treatment HF optimize reduce functional cognitive decline LTCF resident HF , order preserve independence current level disability long possible .</detailed_description>
