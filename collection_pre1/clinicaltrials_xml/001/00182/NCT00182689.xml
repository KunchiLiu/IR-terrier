	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy BAY 43-0006 previously-treated , platinum-sensitive platinum-refractory patient measurable disease extensive stage small cell lung cancer ( E-SCLC ) term response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess qualitative quantitative toxicity BAY 43-9006 patient population . II . To assess overall survival group patient treat BAY 43-9006 . III . To collect specimen via Lung Cancer Specimen Repository Protocol ( S9925 ) order perform exploratory analyse relationship select marker patient outcomes . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord platinum sensitivity status ( platinum sensitive v platinum refractory ) . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year study entry .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis small cell lung cancer must extensive disease progression recurrence receive standard firsttime regimen contain either cisplatin carboplatin ; patient receive primary curative chemoradiation therapy limited disease , recur within primary tumor site , previously radiate field distant metastasis also allow participate ; diagnosis base sputum cytology acceptable confirmation independent pathologic review institution document ; patient clinical evidence recurrent small cell lung cancer require confirmatory biopsy eligible trial Patients must measurable disease per RECIST criterion ; patient must evidence disease plain radiograph , CT scan MRI scan ; xrays/scans assess measurable disease must perform within 28 day prior registration ; require test ass nonmeasurable disease must perform within 42 day prior registration ; disease must assess Patients must previously treat exactly one regimen ; must include cisplatin carboplatin ; addition , information must available place patient one two follow category : Platinum sensitive disease : defined initial response platinumbased chemotherapy subsequently progress &gt; 90 day last platinum treatment ; best response platinumbased treatment : CR , PR , stable progression treatment ( circle one ) ; NOTE : Prior chemotherapy must complete least 90 day prior registration OR Platinum refractory disease ; response platinumbased chemotherapy , progression platinumbased therapy , progression within 90 day complete platinumbased therapy Patient may receive previous radiation therapy , must complete least 21 day prior registration patient recover associated toxicity ; must plan patient receive concurrent radiation therapy measurable lesion ; measurable disease may present inside area prior radiation therapy provide lesion demonstrate progress CT scan measurable disease outside prior radiation field Patients may receive prior surgery provide least 14 day elapse since surgery ( thoracic major surgery ) patient recover associated toxicity ; patient must disease outside area previous surgical resection new lesion must present CORRELATIVE SCIENCE STUDIES : Institutions must IRB approval S9925 ( Lung Cancer Specimen Repository ) ; patient must offer participation S9925 ; patient 's consent , specimen submit test via S9925 ; patient must register separately S9925 order institution receive credit specimen submission Serum creatinine = &lt; institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance &gt;
