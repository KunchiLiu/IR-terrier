	<detailed_description>In addition hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia smoking , well non-traditional risk factor elevate C-reactive protein , homocysteine , Lp ( ) , reduce renal function , depletion endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) peripheral circulation may represent another important explanation excess cardiovascular morbidity kidney transplant recipient . In context , potential association immunosuppressive therapy EPCs kidney transplant recipients deserve special consideration . The use tacrolimus associate favorable cardiovascular risk factor profile term improve blood pressure lipid level kidney transplant recipient compare cyclosporine user . Therefore , one speculate whether tacrolimus user might great EPC count compare patient treated cyclosporine . In pilot study cross-sectionally study EPC count 90 stable , middle-aged kidney transplant recipient . From multivariate analysis , find independent inverse association EPC count body mass index systolic blood pressure . Statin use associate great EPC count , patient receive azathioprine low EPC count . These finding raise hypothesis whether EPCs responsible , least part , well-established association factor cardiovascular outcome . Cystatin C superior serum creatinine marker kidney function since cystatin C sensitive marker serum creatine small change glomerular filtration rate . Until , available data change cystatin C measure graft function conversion cyclosporine base immunosuppressive regimen tacrolimus . There accumulate evidence important pathogenetic role donor-reactive antibody kidney allograft rejection . Recent study suggest anti-humoral activity tacrolimus set chronic rejection . Recent finding suggest patient cyclosporine , tacrolimus rescue therapy could efficiently inhibit antibody formation . Objective 1 : To evaluate change endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) count kidney graft recipient convert cyclosporine tacrolimus . Objective 2 : To evaluate change cystatin C measure renal function kidney graft recipient convert cyclosporine tacrolimus . Objective 3 : To determine effect tacrolimus humoral alloreactivity kidney graft recipient Study design : A 2:1 randomize , parallel group , open-label , prospective trial compare two different immunosuppressive regimen approximately 148 patient . Group A : Convert tacrolimus combination with/without mycophenolate mofetil and/or steroid . Group B : Maintain cyclosporine combination with/without mycophenolate mofetil and/or steroid . Patients follow 24 month conversion . In amendment ( August 2006 ) register pharmacogenetic analysis multi-drug resistance transporter 1 ( MDR1 ) gene ( gene symbol : ABCB1 ) . The patients´ DNA extract peripheral venous blood manually industrial extraction kit . Two gene section amplify polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Mutations determine restriction enzyme ( restriction fragment length polymorphism , RFLP ) .</detailed_description>
