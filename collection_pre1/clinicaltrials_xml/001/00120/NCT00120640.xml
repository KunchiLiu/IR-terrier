	<brief_summary>The goal research determine effectiveness 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate ( 17P ) treatment preterm delivery . Treatment progesterone emerge standard care prevention preterm delivery asymptomatic patient high risk preterm birth due prior preterm delivery . Our goal evaluate whether progesterone also effective reduce preterm birth symptomatic patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Preterm Labor With 17 Alpha-hydroxyprogesterone Caproate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm delivery remain one important issue face perinatal medicine today . In 1999 , prematurity/low birthweight account 4,304 neonatal death , reflect rate neonatal mortality due prematurity 23.0 per 100,000 live birth . Despite extent problem , exact etiology preterm delivery completely understood . It clear many pathway involve preterm delivery , ultimately must converge upon one final endpoint , likely related progesterone . In animal model progesterone withdrawal clearly directly ( rodent , rabbit ) indirectly ( sheep ) involve initiation parturition , however exact way progesterone work human unclear . There resurgence interest association progesterone preterm delivery . Two recent trial look utility progesterone prevention preterm delivery high-risk patient . In multicenter trial report New England Journal Medicine 2003 , Meis et al , recruit 463 patient history spontaneous preterm delivery randomize 2:1 ratio intramuscular 17-hydroxyprogesterone vs. placebo 16-20 week 36 week . Treatment 17P significantly reduce risk delivery &lt; 37 week , &lt; 35 week , &lt; 32 week . The Yale Progesterone Study randomize , placebo-controlled trial use 17 hydroxyprogesterone treatment preterm labor . The design similar Meis NEJM trial , except patient symptomatic preterm labor , rather asymptomatic history preterm delivery . In addition therapeutic intervention plan , researcher intend collect specimen assess marker PTD , treatment . In way , researcher analyze pathway PTD involve , finally , effect progesterone marker assess .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients preterm labor describe . Patients accurately date singleton gestation . Accurate date define estimate date delivery ( EDD ) base last menstrual period ( LMP ) dating ( 280 day first day LMP ) confirm ultrasound do 20 week , yield EDD within 10 day LMP dating . If LMP available , EDD must base 2 ultrasound perform least 2 week apart , concordant within 5 day EDD . Patients first presentation preterm labor invite participate . Patients whose plan management include admission hospital administration antenatal steroid fetal well . Rupture membranes Major know fetal anomaly Cervical dilation &gt; 4 centimeter Uterine anomalies Cervical cerclage Treatment pregnancy progesterone 14 week ' gestation ( use 14 week ' gestation permit ) Previous admission preterm labor Contraindications tocolysis , include fetal distress , chorioamnionitis , preeclampsia , hemodynamic instability Coexisting maternal disease include hypertension require medical therapy , cancer , seizure disorder , thromboembolic disorder , liver disease . Patients treat oral beta adrenergic asthma also exclude . Age &lt; 18 year</criteria>
