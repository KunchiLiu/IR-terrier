	<brief_summary>Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy ( PML ) rare infectious disease brain , provoke JC virus . It usually occur subject impair immune system HIV infection . To date , specific antiviral treatment susceptible cure PML . But show set HIV-related PML , combination antiretroviral therapy allow restoration immune system might stop progression PML . The objective study appreciate supplementary efficiency bring association powerful antiretroviral molecule include enfuvirtide evolution PML . This research program involve 30 patient several centre France . All patient participate receive enfuvirtide 6 month association combination two potent antiretroviral drug . The total duration follow-up patient 1 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Intensification Antiretroviral Therapy Including Enfuvirtide HIV-1-Related Progressive Multifocal Leucoencephalopathy ( ANRS125 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim open-label multicentre study estimate effect early therapy intensification base potent antiretroviral combination include enfuvirtide ( FUZEON® ) survival patient HIV-1-related progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy ( PML ) . To demonstrate observed rate significantly superior 45 % , inclusion 24 patient necessary . At last , 30 patient recruit towards risk estimate 25 % invalid inclusion . Patients include follow criterion : HIV-1 document Western Blot , clinical radiological ( MRI ) evidence active LEMP clinical evolution ( deterioration ) less 90 day , documentation PML diagnosis le 30 day inclusion , inform consent ( patient confidence surrogate decision make incapacity ) . Exclusion criterion follow : age less 18-year-old ; concomitant opportunistic infection central nervous system ; pregnancy - feeding ; co-infection HIV2 ; history immunotherapy ( interleukin 2 , alpha-interferon ) treatment FUZEON® ; history treatment cidofovir ; contra-indication receive FUZEON ® . An independent committee meet regularly estimate validity PML diagnosis include patient . The duration treatment FUZEON® 6 month association combination two antiretroviral molecule pursue next 6 month . These molecule choose accord past treatment patient . A combination include efavirenz , lopinavir/ritonavir , tenofovir/emtricitabine ( shape TRUVADA® ) propose naïve patient . For pretreated patient ( approximately quarter inclusion ) , antiretroviral therapy choose every case basis therapeutic history viral genotype resistance . Such association contain least two antiretroviral molecule , issue two different family among three follow one ( nucleoside inhibitor reverse transcriptase , non-nucleoside inhibitor reverse transcriptase , protease inhibitor ) . The projected duration period inclusion 18 month . A total duration 2.5 year project . Evaluation criterion ANRS 125 trial follow . Clinical : rate survival functional score ( Modified Rankin Outcome Scale ) M12 . Virological : evolution JC viral load CSF ; percentage patient JC virus clearance CSF M3 M6 . Immunological : evolution T CD4 T CD8 subpopulation . Evolution anti-JC virus specific T cell ( CD4 CD8 ) responses . Pharmacological : dosage concentration enfuvirtide CSF compare plasma .</detailed_description>
