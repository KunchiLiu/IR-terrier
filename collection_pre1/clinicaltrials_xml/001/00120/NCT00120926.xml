	<brief_summary>Malnutrition common problem neonatal intensive care unit . Recent study indicate prematurely bear neonate commonly develop severe nutritional deficit first week birth , refer extrauterine growth restriction . Despite increase growth second month hospitalization , many neonate ultimately discharge home grown inadequately . The early nutritional deficit affect weight gain well growth length head circumference . Growth measurement weight , length , head circumference , however , macroscopic measure nutritional status underestimate physiologic consequence prolong nutritional deprivation . Energy micronutrient deficiency alter growth cellular tissue level macroscopic measure alter . In brain , instance , energy require cell division neuronal growth , glial cell function , myelination . Energy deprivation may consequently alter neuronal function growth , result adverse neurodevelopmental outcome . Immunocompetence also appear sensitive untoward effect energy nutritional deficiency . Malnourished neonate often exhibit immune deficiency relate inadequate protein intake compound already immature immune system . Such immunodeficiency result susceptibility infectious agent create substantial morbidity mortality course intensive care premature infant . A recent study suggest postnatal malnutrition growth restriction inevitable current recommend dietary intake follow . Multicenter study show variation dietary intake account 45 % variation growth . Hence , effort focus determine whether nutritional deficiency observe growth restriction premature infant prevent use optimal nutritional intake . In addition , inadequate protein support may primary cause growth failure . Based animal study show high utero amino acid flux observe latter phase gestation , Thureen et al suggest use high dos amino acid supplementation order minimize growth restriction improve outcome premature infant . However large human trial demonstrate approach promotes well growth safe . While small dos amino acid may inadequate promote normal growth , high dos may lead elevate serum amino acid level increase occurrence toxicity . Through implementation multicenter , randomize trial tandem mass spectrometry , investigator propose evaluate effect two distinct strategy amino acid supplementation serum amino acid profile growth premature infant first 28 day life .</brief_summary>
