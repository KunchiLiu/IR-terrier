	<brief_summary>Interruption pregnancy 14 week gestation may require fetus dead , severely malformed case maternal illness . This process usually conduct medically Australia , use prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol . This prostaglandin , although specifically license use pregnancy termination , common abortifacient lot accumulate experience within Australia internationally . Since 1996 , misoprostol , synthetic prostaglandin , use King Edward Memorial Hospital principal agent second trimester pregnancy termination . This agent administer vaginally , current form dosage regimen result 75-80 % woman deliver within 24 hour . As experience agent grown , observe approximately 40 % woman placenta either completely retain incompletely deliver , necessitate operative removal increase potential maternal blood loss . In study , plan , randomize control clinical trial , evaluate three regimen management placental delivery woman undergo second trimester pregnancy interruption . The primary intention study develop third stage management protocol reduce incidence placental retention second trimester medical pregnancy termination . The secondary aim study ass ultrasound appearance uterus cavity within 24 hour second trim pregnancy termination . The ultrasound appearance uterus follow second trim pregnancy loss previously investigate detail . Previous ultrasound study term postpartum uterus demonstrate high incidence echogenic material within uterine cavity soon uncomplicated vaginal delivery . These finding concern ultrasound appearance may erroneously imply need operative intervention . The investigator wish ascertain high incidence echogenic tissue presence also true second trimester . Ultrasound frequently use clinician define placental completeness potential requirement surgical curettage . The data single sonographic examination uterus provide baseline data plan longitudinal study uterine appearance follow second trim pregnancy loss correlation clinical symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : All woman admit King Edward Memorial Hospital Women pregnancy interruption severe fetal anomaly maternal pregnancy complication 14 24 week gestation invite participate study . No woman intrauterine fetal demise recruit due potential confounding effect fetal death placental separation process . Once consent obtain , woman randomise three placental management strategy group : Group 1 : Standard management protocol ; Group 2 : Oxytocin protocol ; Group 3 : Oral misoprostol protocol . Group 1 : Women allocate standard management protocol receive routine oxytocic follow delivery fetus . If spontaneous placental expulsion occur within 60 minute delivery , heavy vaginal bleeding ensues within time period , manual removal placenta perform operating room general regional anaesthesia . No cord traction use facilitate placental expulsion , although maternal expulsive effort digital extraction placenta visible vaginal introitus permissible . Group 2 : Women allocate oxytocin protocol receive single intramuscular injection ( IMI ) upper thigh 10 IU oxytocin ( SyntocinonÂ® ) soon fetus expel . If placental expulsion occur within 60 minute delivery , heavy vaginal bleeding ensues within time period , manual removal placenta perform operating room general regional anaesthesia . No cord traction use facilitate placental expulsion , although maternal expulsive effort digital extraction placenta visible vaginal introitus permissible . Group 3 : Women allocate oral misoprostol protocol receive single oral dose 600 mcg misoprostol soon fetus expel . If placental expulsion occur within 60 minute delivery , heavy vaginal bleeding ensues within time period , manual removal placenta perform operating room general regional anaesthesia . No cord traction use facilitate placental expulsion , although maternal expulsive effort digital extraction placenta visible vaginal introitus permissible . The midwife nurse care woman inspect placenta visually non-surgical expulsion completeness . This may occur case obvious incomplete expulsion placenta , woman transfer operating room completion evacuation basis clinical need . Due placental fragmentation may occur manual removal placenta operate room possible woman require surgical removal placenta visual placental inspection , however surgeon ass completeness removal digitally operate room . A maternal full blood count perform prior commencement termination process repeat 6 hour delivery placenta , index blood loss . The pre-termination full blood count standard investigation current clinical pathway . The attend nurse midwife weigh pads/sheets fetal delivery placental expulsion estimate blood loss three group . Maternal pulse , blood pressure temperature record every 15 minute fetal expulsion 1 hour post-placental delivery . Maternal symptom nausea , headache abdominal pain record every 15 minute visual analogue scale fetal expulsion placental delivery transfer operating room . Maternal emesis record fetal expulsion 1-hour post-placental delivery . All woman undergo transabdominal ultrasound assessment uterine cavity prior hospital discharge ( approximately 6-12 hour post-delivery ) King Edward Memorial Hospital Diagnostic Imaging Department . The uterine size , myometrial thickness , myometrial vascularity , uterine cavity dimension appearance uterine cavity content assess sonographically . Myometrial vascularity correlate pre-delivery placental position . All image review Chief Investigator , blind clinical outcome , use hospital PACS . The Chief Investigator ( formal ultrasound qualification ) ass image quality , measurement appearance uterine cavity . The ultrasound appearance woman undergone operative placental removal use baseline control group uterine cavity appearance , assume placental tissue present group . The ultrasound appearance uterus report clinician care woman , evidence term uterine cavity ultrasound study echogenic material frequent impact adversely upon postnatal course . The exception clinician care woman request ultrasound evaluation uterine cavity suspect retained placental tissue . It estimate 3-5 woman per week eligible recruitment study additional workload conduct without adversely impact duty Diagnostic Imaging Department . The Chief Investigator head KEMH Ultrasound Department responsible workload distribution within unit . All woman telephone 4 week post-termination Chief Investigator enquire post-discharge bleeding complication ( eg . antibiotic prescription , curettage , duration vaginal bleeding ) . The primary objective achieve conduct study : 1 . The efficacy routine ecbolic agent facilitate spontaneous placental expulsion compare non-pharmacologic intervention . This primarily determine ascertain percentage woman group require operative removal placenta . The investigator ' aim reduce requirement operative placental removal current 40 % 20 % . 2 . Comparison frequency severity side-effects associate routine ecbolic administration third stage . 3 . The sonographic appearance uterus cavity immediate post-delivery period . It plan future study assess sonographic appearance second trimester uterus delivery longitudinal manner time , use data baseline information . Sample size : Up 300 woman recruit study ( 100 per group ) . This sample size achieve 80 % power detect reduction 40 % placental retention current regimen non-pharmacological third stage management 20 % placental retention use either 5IU oxytocin IMI delivery 600 mcg misoprostol orally . Two pairwise comparison current regimen new regimen conduct 0.025 significance level attain overall 0.05 significance level use test proportion . This sample size also allow interim analysis consist two pairwise test , 60 patient per group recruit ( nominal significance level 0.003 per test , critical Z-statistic=3.02 ) final analysis ( nominal significance level 0.024 per test , critical Z-statistic=2.25 ) . Sequential sample size calculation obtain use O'Brien-Fleming spending function test statistic boundary ( PASS 2002 Windows , Kaysville Utah ) . At time interim analysis , placental retention rate per study arm estimate possibility stop recruitment one arm due futility consider . Statistical Analysis : Descriptive statistic utilise mean standard deviation ( median interquartile range ) continuous data frequency distribution categorical data . The primary endpoint evaluate use pairwise test proportion . Secondary analysis implement logistic regression model investigate patient characteristic relevant prediction placental retention .</detailed_description>
