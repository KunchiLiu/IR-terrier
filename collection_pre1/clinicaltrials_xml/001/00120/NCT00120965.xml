	<brief_summary>The AutoPulse Assisted Prehospital International Resuscitation ( ASPIRE ) Trial compare efficacy circulatory assist manual chest compression versus automate chest compression device ( AutoPulseâ„¢ ) resuscitative attempt follow out-of-hospital cardiac arrest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AutoPulse Assisted Prehospital International Resuscitation Trial ( ASPIRE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extensive early experience yield reliably validated instance out-of-hospital arrest associate tachyarrhythmia resuscitate without successful defibrillatory shock . This together increase availability automate external defibrillator ( AEDs ) , increasingly attractive price , lead , past decade , strong emphasis early defibrillation . This emphasis may inadvertently result decreased emphasis cardiopulmonary resuscitative technique , particularly light publication decry uniformly poor quality CPR perform layman , medical professional , even EMS personnel . However , recent research strongly suggest assisted reperfusion prior defibrillation may actually significantly improve survival rate . These report , base clinical study , receive substantial confirmation carefully control laboratory study , particularly pig . If assist reperfusion prior defibrillation ( subsequent fail shock ) important , reasonable suppose benefit related quality chest compression . Observations resuscitative effort field indicate maintain compression one difficult task , variety reason . Observations laboratory train paramedic show depth compression compression rate diminish rapidly time onset CPR , without participant aware his/her effort actually diminish . The desire provide consistent quality compression lead development mechanical compression assist device call AutoPulse . It self-contained , portable chest compression device rapidly field deployable .</detailed_description>
