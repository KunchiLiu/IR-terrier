	<brief_summary>This study determine whether medication metoclopramide improve red blood count people myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . MDS think affect blood stem cell , result low level red blood cells-that , anemia-as well low white blood cell platelet count . Patients MDS risk infection , spontaneous bleeding , possible progression leukemia , cancer bone marrow . Although bone marrow produce blood cell , production decrease patient MDS . The definitive way treat MDS stem cell transplantation , serious complication high risk death make unsuitable patient older age 60 match sibling donor . However , scientist note improvement anemia use metoclopramide , inexpensive , commonly use medication many negative side effect . This study evaluate safety effectiveness medicine patient MDS . Patients age 18 72 whose MDS would require low-intensity treatment-for example , growth factor transfusions-and pregnant breastfeeding may eligible study . There 60 participant . Screening test include complete physical examination medical history , patient provide list current medication supplement take . There collection 4 tablespoon blood analysis blood count well liver kidney function . Patients may also undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain , procedure optional . During MRI , lie table slide enclose tunnel scanner . The MRI take 20 30 minute , patient ask lie still possible . There also bone marrow biopsy , patient one do within 4 week start study . Eligible patient take 10 mg dose metoclopramide mouth , three time day , 20 week . They give 4-week supply , renew monthly treatment visit . It essential patient see NIH first , third , fifth month study . Visits make meantime , second fourth month , may do office doctor refer study , NIH . During treatment visit , patient ask update medical history , health condition , use medication herbal supplement . There also collection 1 tablespoon blood laboratory test . Patients ask make similar follow-up visit 1 month stop take metoclopramide , response treatment evaluate . The use metoclopramide may cause people feel dizzy , lightheaded , tire , less alert normally . For first 24 48 hour , patient cautious driving , use machinery , perform hazardous activity . This medicine add effect alcohol central nervous system depressants-such medicine allergy cold , tranquilizer , prescription pain reliever . Patients need check research team take type medicine , well herbal supplement , use metoclopramide . This study may may direct benefit participant . For , drug may improve red blood cell count decrease need red cell transfusion . Knowledge gain study may help people future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metoclopramide Treat Anemia Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) present low red blood cell , white blood cell platelet , alone combination . The definitive treatment stem cell transplantation . Unfortunately , treatment-related mortality precludes application procedure patient older 60 year lack suitable match sibling donor . A proportion patient show respond wide variety immunosuppressive agent , include cyclosporine ( CSA ) antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) . However , nonresponse relapse continue problematic . Therefore , patient MDS receive supportive treatment transfusion growth factor , erythropoietin ( EPO ) G-CSF , improve blood count . However , growth factor always effective improve cytopenia iron overload inevitable long-term complication red blood cell transfusion . Recently , Abkowitz et al describe clinically significant improvement anemia 3 9 patient Diamond-Blackfan anemia ( DBA ) use metoclopramide , inexpensive , commonly use medication rare side effect . We hypothesize therapy metoclopramide might also benefit patient cause refractory anemia , individual anemia due MDS . We therefore propose Phase II clinical trial evaluate metoclopramide treatment anemia patient MDS .</detailed_description>
