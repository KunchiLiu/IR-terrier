At end 14 day period , woman visit home repeat finger-prick blood sample obtain determination Hb preparation two thick blood film . Haemoglobin measure use Haemocue blood film examine malaria parasite stain Giemsa two microscopist blind treatment code . If discrepant result find , third read do majority view accept . Trial end-point The primary end-point trial prevalence Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia 14 day treatment woman parasitemic presentation . Parasite prevalence day 14 irrespective initial finding mean Hb day 14 secondary end-points . Sample size It assume 30 % woman would parasitemic presentation cure rate SP receive folic acid time would 97 % . To 90 % power 5 % level significance show 10 % reduction cure rate SP give folic acid , 483 woman require arm trial . Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) A DSMB establish monitor conduct trial approve analytical plan prior break study code .
