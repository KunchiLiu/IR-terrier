	<detailed_description>It difficult identify specific nutrient food group associate breast cancer risk epidemiological study do U.S . Attention turn importance overall eating pattern . A Greek-Mediterranean dietary pattern great potential cancer prevention . Two distinct aspect eat pattern type fat consume high fruit/vegetable intake relative average intake United States . We propose develop test exchange list Greek-Mediterranean diet could use future clinical trial breast cancer prevention woman increase risk . In proposed study , woman randomize either continue usual diet follow intervention diet 6 month . The intervention diet design decrease polyunsaturated ( P ) saturate ( S ) fat intake increase monounsaturated ( M ) fat intake . The P : S : M ratio typical American diet 1.0:1.5:1.7 , goal intervention diet 1:2:5 , much closer traditional Greek diet . A predominant source fat olive oil . The fruit vegetable goal 7-9 servings/day , depend energy intake . These dietary change achieve use individualized telephone counsel monthly group session dietitian . Menus provide example , diet self-selected . Compliance dietary goal assess food record level plasma fatty acid , lipid carotenoid . As feasibility investigation planning large trial , plasma 8-isoprostane , oxidize lycopene , insulin glucose level also assess since may lend insight two possible mechanism may responsible cancer preventive effect diet . This dietary trial provide important data ability woman follow typical American eating pattern change dietary intake reflect Greek-Mediterranean pattern . This intervention approach test effect marker breast cancer risk future study .</detailed_description>
