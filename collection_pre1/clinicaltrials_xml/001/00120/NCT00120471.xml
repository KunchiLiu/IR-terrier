During last trim pregnancy , HIV infect woman screen eligibility . Women enrol study upon presentation study site delivery . Standard care ARVs prevention MTCT offer woman infant inside outside study ; however , ARVs provide study . There four cohort study : - Cohort 1 woman receive single dose TDF ( SD TDF ) active labor . Cohort 1 woman hospitalize delivery facility Day 3 postpartum . - Cohort 2 woman receive TDF . Cohort 2 woman hospitalize delivery facility Day 7 postpartum . Their infant receive TDF birth Days 3 5 birth . - Cohort 3 begin enrol woman data safety evaluation Cohorts 1 2 complete . Cohort 3 woman hospitalize delivery facility Day 7 postpartum . Women Cohort 3 receive SD TDF active labor , infant receive TDF birth Days 3 5 birth . - Cohort 4 , add study base review data cohort , similar Cohort 3 , except infant receive daily TDF 7 day birth . Researchers believe high frequent dose TDF infant help meet target TDF concentration specify protocol . There seven study visit woman study entry ( Day 0 ) , Day 2 , Days 5 7 , Weeks 6 12 , Months 6 12 postpartum . Medical history , short physical exam , blood collection occur visit . In Cohorts 1 , 3 , 4 , blood collection PK study occur prior receive TDF seven time post-dose . There eight study visit infant , occur within 24 hour birth ; Day 3 ; Days 5 7 ; Weeks 6 12 ; Months 6 , 9 , 12 . Medical history , physical exam , blood collection occur visit . Infants x-rays assess bone health Day 3 Month 3 , except Cohort 4 , include x-rays infant . Infants Cohort 1 blood collection PK study birth four time birth . Infants Cohorts 2 3 undergo blood collection PK study birth , Day 3 , Day 5 . Blood collection visit occur receive TDF 2 10 hour receive TDF . At birth , additional collection occur 18 24 hour receive TDF , Day 5 , two additional collection occur -- 18 24 hour 36 48 hour receive TDF .
