	<brief_summary>Malaria particularly harmful pregnancy cause anemia mother low birth weight , turn , increase infant mortality . Thus , World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend pregnant woman live malaria endemic area Africa receive sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) monthly interval second third trimester pregnancy . Malaria especially severe first pregnancy value intermittent preventative treatment SP first pregnancy clearly show . However , less certain whether multigravidae , less risk , also benefit intermittent preventative treatment SP . To investigate , trial conduct Gambian multigravidae give intermittent preventative treatment SP placebo second third trimester . The prevalence anemia six week delivery , low birth weight poor outcome pregnancy woman group study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Preventative Treatment With Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine Gambian Multigravidae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective The objective study determine whether intermittent preventative treatment ( IPTp ) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) reduce prevalence anemia low birth weight Gambian multigravidae . Study area The study carry 14 mother child health ( MCH ) clinic situate north south bank River Gambia near town Farafenni centre country . In area , malaria highly seasonal entomological inoculation rate 10 -50 infectious bite per year . Study population All woman attend one study clinic trial period multigravidae ask wished join study . If case , initial screen questionnaire administer assess suitability . Eligibility criterion - pregnancy 15 week gestation , hemoglobin ( Hb ) concentration 7 g/dL , absence history sensitivity sulfonamides absence chronic underlying illness . Randomisation If woman meet eligibility criterion , inform write consent sought , give , woman formally recruit study allocate trial number randomise receive either SP placebo . Randomisation do block 12 ; field worker assign number block ensure balance recruitment center . Drug administration Women allocate receive SP ( pyrimethamine 25 mg + sulfadoxine 500 mg ) ( Cosmos Pharmaceuticals , Nairobi ) match placebo . An initial dose SP placebo ( three tablet ) give time enrolment trial subsequent visit antenatal clinic maximum four treatment . All woman give iron folic acid supplement recommend Ministry Health guideline . Surveillance Women visit home twice per week project field worker ass health encourage attend ante-natal clinic monthly interval . Women high risk obstetric complication encourage deliver hospital woman deliver home . If delivery occur hospital health center finger prick blood sample obtain birth weight measure . In case woman deliver home , weight new born baby measure within 5 day delivery finger prick blood sample obtain measurement Hb concentration preparation blood film . Women visit home six week delivery additional blood sample obtain one year later investigate health child . Laboratory method Hemoglobin concentration measure use Hemocue ( Hemocue AB , Angelholm , Sweden ) . Thick blood film stain Giemsa examine malaria parasite . Each slide read two microscopist . If discrepant result obtain , slide read third microscopist majority view accept . Trial end-points The co-primary trial end-points hemoglobin concentration , shortly , birth birthweight weight baby shortly birth . Sample size To detect 20 % reduction estimate risk severe anemia ( Hb &lt; 7 g/dl ) among multigravidae , estimate 30 % control group , 80 % power 5 % level significance allow 30 % loss follow-up calculate study 1115 woman arm require . To show reduction proportion low birthweight baby expect 18 % control group 12 % SP group 80 % power estimate 2 x 1538 woman would need . Thus , target sample size 3,000 . Data management analysis All data double enter verified . Prior break code data base lock copy give chair Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . Statistical analysis do use S-plus STATA . An analytical plan prepare approved DSMB code broken . Trial oversight The trial monitor DSMB . It conduct line requirement Good Clinical Practice .</detailed_description>
