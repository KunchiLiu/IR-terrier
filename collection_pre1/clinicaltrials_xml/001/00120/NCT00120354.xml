	<brief_summary>This study evaluate long-term safety effectiveness lamivudine therapy possibility stop therapy patient whose hepatitis B chronic , , long lasting , respond treatment . Chronic hepatitis B , cause virus , common form liver disease affect 1 million Americans 5 percent world 's population . Health effect include continuous state infectious risk transmit hepatitis people , symptom liver disease , development cirrhosis-that , severe damage liver-and liver cancer . Lamivudine medication block hepatitis B effectively make disappear completely . Scientists believe immune system must also active rid body last trace hepatitis B . Patients age 18 old chronic hepatitis B treat lamivudine may eligible participate study . They undergo medical history physical examination give lamivudine 100 mg tablet take one tablet , day . Patients ask return outpatient clinic every 3 month , undergo brief interview measurement vital signs-such blood pressure , pulse , body weight . During visit , fill questionnaire symptom side effect , see doctor brief medical history examination . There collection blood complete blood count , liver enzymes , hepatitis B virus . Extra blood test may do analyze patient ' immune reaction hepatitis B . Patients also receive refill lamivudine tablet . They continue treated lamivudine long seem control hepatitis infection liver disease . At interval 1 year , patient ultrasound examination , last 1 hour , liver abdomen . Then intervals 5 year , patient undergo liver biopsy , require hospital stay 2 3 day . A liver biopsy do pass needle skin liver obtain piece liver 2 inch long 1/16-inch diameter . A small amount bleeding probably occur liver biopsy . Internal bleeding risk , may require patient stay hospital day longer , rest , observation pain medicine . The biopsy provide information prove whether lamivudine control liver disease prevent worsen progress cirrhosis . Side effect lamivudine include fatigue , muscle ache , fever chill , sore throat , nausea , stomach pain cramp , diarrhea . Serious side effect rare , occur less 1 % people take lamivudine . They include inflammation pancreas , nerve damage , buildup lactic acid blood . About 25 % patient experience temporary worsening , flare , hepatitis first month treatment . If flare severe , important researcher determine whether cause resistance lamivudine immune system act hepatitis B virus another liver condition . A flare hepatitis also occur lamivudine stop , , withdrawal . In situation , test hepatitis B virus level liver condition important . It may lead treatment stop lamivudine take another medication instead . While patient participate study , careful evaluation hepatitis general condition . They may improvement disease result long-term lamivudine therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Lamivudine Therapy Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The major aim study evaluate long-term efficacy safety lamivudine therapy possibility stop therapy cohort patient chronic hepatitis B maintain response treatment . Lamivudine nucleoside analogue potent activity hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , approve use United States use extensively throughout world treat HBV HIV infection . Lamivudine well tolerate adverse event rare . Its major shortcoming development antiviral resistance prolong therapy result loss effectiveness , mark rise viral level return disease activity . Some patient , however , maintain response lamivudine therapy individual treatment continue indefinitely hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) lose therapy permanently stop . This protocol allow long-term treatment evaluation patient . Patients maintain lamivudine dose 100 mg daily see every three month interim medical history serum test aminotransferase level hepatitis B marker , liver biopsy do every 5 year . Lamivudine stop HBsAg lose . The protocol also include option attempt withdrawal therapy control condition focus induce immune reactivity HBV clearance HBsAg . Patients stop lamivudine short period ( 1 week , later 2 , 4 8 week ) monitor 12 week afterwards aminotransferase level , HBV DNA level CD4+ CD8+ T cell response HBV antigen . Patients demonstrate significant worsen hepatitis undergo attempt withdrawal . The endpoint successful therapy define loss hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) development antibody ( anti-HBs ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 18 year , male female Presence HBsAg serum least 6 month . Previous liver biopsy histology show chronic hepatitis without cirrhosis . Longterm ( great 1 year ) lamivudine therapy dose 100 mg daily . Normal near normal ( less twice upper limit normal ) serum aminotransferase level . HBV DNA level 10 ( 5 ) copy per ml lamivudine . Written informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : In woman , pregnancy , breast feeding , , capable bearing child , inability practice adequate contraception . Significant systemic illness liver disease , include congestive heart failure , renal failure , chronic pancreatitis , diabetes mellitus poor control . Serum creatinine great 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance le 50 cc/min . A history clinically apparent pancreatitis evidence subclinical pancreatitis show serum amylase value twice upper limit normal range abnormality pancreas computerize tomography image study abdomen . Severe cirrhosis define Child 's stage C ( ChildPugh score 7 ) . HIV infection indicate presence antiHIV serum . Chronic hepatitis C show presence antiHCV HCV RNA serum . Immunosuppressive therapy require use 10 mg prednisone ( equivalent ) per day . Other antiviral therapy chronic hepatitis B within previous 3 month . Sensory motor neuropathy apparent medical history physical examination .</criteria>
