	<brief_summary>High amount calcium urine ( hypercalciuria ) cause development kidney stone child . Treatment child include plenty fluid , low-salt diet medication potassium citrate . A major advantage potassium citrate , compare hydrochlorothiazide , lack side effect . One problem researcher others observe child continue form kidney stone despite correction hypercalciuria potassium citrate . One possible explanation individual potassium citrate therapy result excessive elevation urine pH , situation may predispose calcium phosphate stone formation . In study , researcher study effect potassium citrate urine chemistry acid-base balance three group child age 5-17 year : - child hypercalciuric stone former ; - healthy child without history hypercalciuria kidney stone . Particular attention pay try identify develop high urine pH ( &gt; 8 ) factor lead metabolic reaction . The researcher try learn whether child ’ characteristic , disease manifestation , dose drug , combination may cause development alkaline urine . Based result , researcher hope able good “ tailor ” individual treatment child kidney stone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Potassium Citrate Urine Children With Elevated Calcium Urine Kidney Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercalciuria common clinical pediatric problem child associate renal stone . Most renal stone ( 80 % ) form calcium oxalate , calcium phosphate phase ( apatite ) , brushite ( calcium monohydrogen phosphate ) . Hypercalciuria either primary ( account vast majority child calcium stone ) secondary . Treatment child calcium stone involve non-pharmacological pharmacological intervention . Non-pharmacological intervention include high fluid intake , low sodium , potassium enhance diet , RDA calcium protein . Historically , specific treatment hypercalciuric stone former include thiazide , reduce calciuria , low urinary saturation calcium oxalate phosphate , restore normal intestinal calcium absorption . However thiazides induce hypokalemia hypocitraturia , latter attenuate beneficial effect drug stone formation . Currently , drug choice replace thiazide treat idiopathic hypercalciuria potassium citrate . Potassium citrate readily absorb gastrointestinal tract , excrete urine , inhibit crystallization stone form calcium salt bind calcium ion , thus decrease urinary saturation inhibit nucleation crystal growth calcium oxalate ; therefore , potassium citrate effective stone inhibitor agent . A major advantage potassium citrate lack side effect . One problem see clinical practice child primary hypercalciuria , even calciuria treat successfully potassium citrate , continue develop stone . It suggest elevation urine pH , see patient treat potassium citrate , may result alkaline urinary milieu promote calcium phosphate stone formation . In study , researcher plan investigate effect potassium citrate urine chemistry acid-base balance child hypercalciuric stone former . The researcher try identify whether beneficial effect potassium citrate supplementation lower urine calcium increase citrate might offset high urine pH ( &gt; 8 ) could promote formation calcium phosphate stone . Three group subject age 5-17 year study : group 1 - idiopathic hypercalciuric stone former ; group 2 - idiopathic hypercalciuric non-stone former ; group 3 - normocalciuric subject . Three visit schedule participant , subject receive two dos potassium citrate . Urine chemistry acid-base parameter measure . The researcher try learn whether child ’ characteristic , disease manifestation , dose drug , combination may cause development alkaline urine . Based study result , researcher hope able good “ tailor ” individual treatment child kidney stone due idiopathic hypercalciuria .</detailed_description>
