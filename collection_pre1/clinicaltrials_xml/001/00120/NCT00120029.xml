	<detailed_description>Obesity adverse effect breast cancer survival recurrence , may mediate via insulin resistance associate obesity . This matter exceptional concern African-American ( AA ) breast cancer survivor since great proportion AAs European Americans ( EA ) obese , insulin-resistant diabetic . This proposal seek test effect weight loss intervention obese overweight AA breast cancer survivor ( body mass index 25-40 kg/m2 , stage I , II , IIIA cancer , free recurrence ) . Subjects ( n=100 ) randomize across 3 arm : 1 ) control ; 2 ) individualize , dietitian-led counseling ; 3 ) dietitian-led counseling combine peer counsel use telephone counseling train peer AA breast cancer survivor successful weight control . Psychosocial factor affect extent weight loss achieve assessed , include individual , home community-level factor . Some factor may change weight loss achieve assessed intervention . Genetic polymorphism show associate increase body weight , insulin resistance , lipid metabolism , oxidative stress determine related baseline post-intervention anthropometric biologic measure . This help elucidate inter-individual difference response weight loss intervention . The possible beneficial effect weight loss health risk associate obesity evaluate measure insulin resistance , insulin-like growth factor lipid level blood sample , well blood pressure anthropometric measure . The effect weight loss measure study obese overweight population , little data breast cancer survivor . Finally , attempt determine beneficial effect weight loss detect breast , since relate subsequent breast cancer risk . The breast contralateral surgery subject ductal lavage baseline , 12 24 month . The investigator examine effect weight change marker oxidative stress breast nipple aspirate fluid obtain part lavage procedure . Levels lipid peroxidation high fluid relate nuclear atypia breast cancer risk . The nuclear morphology epithelial cell obtain ductal lavage therefore quantify well . Weight loss obese overweight AA breast cancer survivor improve psychosocial function biological indicator health risk .</detailed_description>
