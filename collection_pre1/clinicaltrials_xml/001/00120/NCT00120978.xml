	<brief_title>Can Advair Flovent Reduce Systemic Inflammation Related Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) ? A Multi-Center Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>What problem address ? Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) increase risk cardiovascular event . Indeed , ischemic heart disease one leading cause mortality hospitalization among patient mild moderate COPD . For every 10 % decrease forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , cardiovascular mortality increase ~28 % , nonfatal coronary event increase ~20 % mild moderate COPD . How COPD increase risk poor cardiovascular outcome largely unknown . However , grow evidence persistent low-grade systemic inflammation present COPD may contribute pathogenesis atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease among COPD patient . Circulating level C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , strongly link poor cardiovascular outcome general population , demonstrate elevated COPD . Moreover , elevate level CRP associate myocardial injury COPD . Reduction level CRP , hand , show associate improve outcomes various population . Other cytokine interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) , potent regulator CRP , also associate cardiovascular event . If linkage systemic inflammation atherosclerosis hold true COPD , systemic inflammation and/or marker may provide new important therapeutic target COPD management . Corticosteroids ( CS ) reduce CRP circulate inflammatory cytokine level acute pro-inflammatory state . They also down-regulate certain inflammatory cell cytokine expression airway COPD patient attenuate airway hyperresponsiveness related COPD . More importantly , large clinical study , show reduce clinical exacerbation , improve health status may even reduce mortality COPD . The mechanism improvement occur know . Recently , group demonstrate relatively small study short-term inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) therapy repress serum CRP level stable COPD patient . Conversely , withdrawal ICS lead marked increase serum CRP level . Although promising , data consider definitive study small size scope ( N=41 patient ) . Additionally , study address potential effect combination therapy ICS long-acting β2 agonist ( LABA ) .This important short-coming combination therapy show produce improved clinical outcome ICS monotherapy commonly use clinician treatment moderate severe COPD . In-vitro study suggest steroid LABAs may “ synergistically ” down-regulate inflammation COPD . Whether occur in-vivo remain largely unknown untested . What propose trial design : This trial double blind , placebo-controlled multi-center study compare effect Advair , Flovent placebo serum CRP COPD . All study participant first undergo run-in phase treat Flovent 500 mcg bid . This follow withdrawal phase wherein participant FREE ICS LABAs 4 week . After withdrawal phase , participant randomly assign ( use computer generate algorithm ) one three arm : placebo ; Flovent ; Advair Run-In Phase ( 4 week ) : The use ICS , theophylline , leukotriene modifier , LABA prohibit subject maintain Flovent 500 mcg bid . Regular use tiotropium need use short-acting β2 ( salbutamol ) and/or anti-cholinergic ( Atrovent ) allow . Why phase need ? Management COPD variable . Because controversy surround use ICS LABAs , patient enrollment take medication , others . This phase ensure uniformity therapy ( particular use ICS dose ) study participant . Withdrawal Phase ( 4 week ) : Flovent discontinue participant also take ICS , theophylline , LABAs leukotriene modifier period . Regular use tiotropium need use short-acting β2 ( salbutamol ) and/or anti-cholinergic ( Atrovent ) allow . Why phase need ? There two principal reason phase need . One way “ prove ” ICS modifies serum CRP level demonstrate withdrawal ICS increase CRP level re-introduction ICS suppress CRP level . The Second reason researcher ' pilot study find serum CRP level high patient ICS 4 week . To achieve necessary statistical power study , reasonably high serum CRP signal desirable begin randomization period . Active Treatment Phase ( 4 week ) : Subjects randomize one 3 arm , placebo , Advair , Flovent . Rescue medication ( anti-cholinergics short-acting β2 ) allow . Participants take inhaled corticosteroid , theophylline , leukotriene modifier LABAs period . Why phase 4 week ? Exacerbations infection elevate CRP level 2 10 fold . The rate normalization CRP level episodes variable ; complete normalization may take place several week resolution infective exacerbation episode . To reduce risk study participant experience clinically apparent infection exacerbation , make phase study relatively short ( 4 week ) . The short treatment period also reduce effect non suboptimal compliance treatment medication CRP level . We believe 4 week therapy sufficient demonstrate suppressive effect Flovent Advair , give fact pilot study , effect Flovent CRP 2 week therapy observe . What propose practical arrangement allocate participant trial group ? Patients randomize ( 1:2:2 ) placebo , Advair , Flovent . Patients first stratify base study site minimize potential impact variation patient care across study site endpoint interest . We hire external statistician ( Ms. Lieling Wu ) prepare computer-generated randomization list block study site use permuted block six . The list inputted randomization computer . When site coordinator identify eligible , consented patient , he/she contact central co-ordinating site St. Paul ’ Hospital ( SPH ) randomization number . The randomization computer issue study identification number study coordinator GlaxoSmithKline ( Mississauga ) delivery appropriate treatment package ( contain one Flovent canister one “ unknown ” puffer ) appropriate study site within two business day . The open-labeled Flovent use “ run-in ” phase , “ unknown ” puffer ( either placebo , Flovent Advair ) dispense start “ active treatment phase. ” What propose method protect source bias ? All research personnel blind treatment group except study biostatistician , responsible randomization computer . Only access master file , link patient identifier randomization number . This computer lock away secure space James Hogg iCAPTURE Centre SPH password protection ( designate ) access . The study medication placebo package deliver identically diskus . What propose duration treatment period ? 4 week run-in ; 4 week withdrawal phase 4 week active treatment phase ( i.e RCT ) . What frequency duration followup ? Participants see enrollment , completion phase study exacerbation infection ( define ) . What propose primary secondary outcome measure ? Primary : The difference CRP start active treatment phase end trial 3 group Secondary : measurement MCP-1 IL-6 ; St. George ’ Respiratory Questionnaire , SGRQ,76 score ; FEV1 How outcome measure measure follow-up ? Blood Collection : During every visit , study personnel take two 10 ml collection blood participant venipuncture ( use standard technique ) . Samples centrifuge serum component aliquoted special tube ( provide coordinate site ) contain anti-proteases . They ship ( Fedexed ) regular ice immediately Study Coordinating Center ( arrive within 24 hour blood collection ) freeze liquid nitrogen store -70ºC freezer analysis . To avoid delay , sample take Friday day precede holiday . A high-sensitive solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) measure serum CRP use . The investigator measure 4,000 serum sample Lung Health Study technique . In comparison nephelometry , another commonly use technique , CRP level high-sensitivity ELISA excellent . The coefficient variation CRP researcher ' laboratory ~5 % . IL-6 MCP-1 also measure use high-sensitivity ELISA assay . The researcher ' laboratory also experience perform assay use serum collect COPD patient . The investigator previously show coefficient variation IL-6 assay 4.7 % ( median ; interquartile range , 1.8 % 11.2 % ) MCP-1 assay 3.2 % ( median ; interquartile range , 1.5 % 5.9 % ) . Spirometry : Spirometry perform accordance guideline American Thoracic Society visit . At first visit , pre post-bronchodilator measurement do . For follow-up visit , pre-bronchodilator value measure . Health Status Measurements : During visit , study participant complete SGRQ person . The SGRQ choose excellent internal consistency ( Cronbach ’ alpha coefficient ≥ 0.76 ) , reliability ( intraclass correlation coefficient ~85 % response measure 6 month apart ) , independent predictor future risk exacerbation mortality COPD . Clinically relevant threshold SGRQ consider score change ≥ 4.0 unit . What propose sample size ? In pilot study ( describe ) , find 2 week , compare placebo group , assign fluticasone experience significant decrease CRP level baseline , adjustment baseline FEV1 , age , sex participate patient ( 57.1 % decrease relative placebo ; p=0.042 ) . The ( geometric ) mean CRP cohort 4.9 mg/L ( 95 % CI , 3.3 7.1 ) . Sample size 200 participant combine Flovent Advair group ( 100 ) 50 placebo group need .</detailed_description>
