	<brief_summary>Background : Plasma exchange suggest theoretical benefit treatment acute renal failure onset multiple myeloma . Two small-randomized trial provide conflict evidence . Objective : To assess effect 5 7 plasma exchange treatment acute renal failure onset multiple myeloma . Design : Randomized control trial 4 stratum ( chemotherapy dialysis dependence ) 1998 2004 . Setting : Hospital plasma exchange unit 14 major Canadian medical center . Participants : 92 voluntary patient age 18 81 acute renal failure onset myeloma volume repletion hypercalcemia . Intervention : 5 7 plasma exchange 50 ml/Kgm 5 % Human Serum Albumin first 10 day plus conventional therapy versus conventional therapy alone . Measurements : The primary outcome composite measure death , dialysis dependence Modification Diet Renal Disease Study glomerular filtration rate ( MDRD GFR ) &lt; 30mg/min/1.73 meter square 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : 5 7 plasma exchange addition conventional therapy onset myeloma acute renal failure , reduce composite outcome death , dialysis dependence GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 meter square 6 month . Entry Criteria : The inclusion criteria new diagnosis multiple myeloma progressive acute kidney failure . The former define bone marrow aspirate &gt; 10 % plasma cell monoclonal light chain urine , plasma renal tissue . The latter define serum creatinine &gt; 200 mmol/L rise &gt; 50 mmol/L precede two week despite correction hypercalcemia , hypovolemia metabolic acidosis require patient normal size kidney renal ultrasound . Exclusion criterion age &lt; 18 &gt; 81 year , obstruction renal ultrasound ( require examination ) , use intravenous contrast non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug previous 2 week , prior treatment myeloma , pregnancy inability provide inform consent . Research Design : This 14 centre randomize clinical trial . Patients fulfill entry criterion refer oncologist nephrologist apheresis physician centre explain nature study via human ethic approve letter information . An informed consent request obtained participant randomize centrally telephone , use random number generator , either receive receive plasma exchange . Recruiting physician unaware treatment allocation prior study entry subsequent randomization , stratify four stratum ( Vincristine , Adriamycin Dexamethasone ( VAD ) /no VAD + on/not acute hemodialysis 28 possible allocation per stratum centre ) . Following random blind allocation , participant treat unblinded manner . Patients follow standard form indicate serum creatinine , dialysis survival status 10 day , 1 month 6 month . Participants enrol September 1998 October 2003 . The study conduct approval institutional ethic review board 14 Canadian site . Treatment : Patients , randomize receive plasma exchange , undergo 5-7 plasma exchange procedure within first 10 day study entry , concurrent initiation chemotherapy . They receive routine plasma exchange 50 ml/kg acid citrate dextrose anticoagulant via Gambro BCT , Spectra cell separator use 5 % human serum albumin normal saline replacement solution . Chemotherapy either Melphalan prednisone take daily 4 day every 28 day 12 cycle 4 day slow intravenous infusion Vincristine Adriamycin couple Dexamethasone ( VAD ) give day 1 4 , 9 12 17 20 28 day cycle 6 cycle . Those allocate plasma exchange , VAD stop 1.5 hour plasma exchange VAD give plasma exchange . Following exchange , subject receive bolus volume VAD would amount infused time period . Measurements : Blood urine test perform time study entry 1 6 month serum creatinine , serum calcium , serum albumin , 24-hour urine protein . Subjects classify severity multiple myeloma presentation Durie-Salmon staging GFR estimate use Modified Diet Renal Disease Equation ( MDRD ) . Outcome Measurements : Following blind random allocation plasma exchange control , treat physician report primary outcome aware treatment assignment . The composite outcome include death , dialysis dependence MDRD GFR calculate serum creatinine 6 month follow-up . The addition GFR &lt; 30ml/min/1.73m2 negative composite outcome reflect significant increase risk death , cardiovascular event hospitalization associate degree kidney impairment . Statistical Analysis : All statistical analysis conduct use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) , Version 12.0 Windows Release 12.0.0 Chicago : SPSS Inc , 2003 . All significance test utilizes two-tailed test , reflect open-ended research hypothesis . Sample Size : There data literature base sample size calculation composite outcome select . Based historical data , indicated event rate &gt; 50 % , calculated sample size design detect effect plasma exchange dialysis dependence , without informative censor death , 6 month . In order detect difference 50 % outcome type 1 error 0.05 ( two-sided ) type 2 error probability 0.20 , sample size requirement 46 per group . We use historical base power analysis provide conservative estimate sample size detect statistically significant difference composite outcome death , dialysis dependence GFR &lt; 30ml/min/1.73m2 future study . Comparison Baseline Characteristics : Pearson ’ Chi-square Yates continuity correction use test statistically significant difference treatment group categorical variable two two table . The Mann-Whitney U employ continuous variable skew frequency distribution , independent sample t-Test use normally distribute continuous variable . Interim Analysis : An interim analysis conduct Safety Subcommittee 50th participant complete 6-month follow-up prevent patient unnecessarily receive less effective treatment . Outcome Differences : Differences plasma exchange control group , respect primary composite secondary outcome 6 month , evaluate Pearson ’ Chi-square . The time death treatment group evaluate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis use log rank test difference group . Uni- multi-variate modeling primary composite outcome conduct mean logistic regression , determine plasma exchange unadjusted adjusted odd ratio select baseline determinant chemotherapy , dialysis , age , urine protein , serum albumin Durie-Salmon stage .</detailed_description>
