	<brief_summary>For child undergo bone marrow transplantation , respiratory failure devastate complication , mortality expectation well 60 % . The researcher devise novel strategy may greatly improve survival . Hemofiltration , continuous form dialysis , design therapy critically ill patient kidney failure . A semi-permeable membrane remove plasma water solute ( 35,000 Daltons molecular weight ) . The researcher treat immuno-compromised child respiratory failure hemofiltration . Many inflammatory molecule size well limit filter . Hemofiltration might remove critical amount inflammatory material , attenuate unregulated inflammatory response central development respiratory failure progression multiple organ failure death . The researcher conduct multi-center trial early continuous hemofiltration respiratory failure child follow bone marrow transplantation . The researcher analyze blood ultrafiltrate use sensitive proteomic method detect several inflammatory biochemicals know active disease , look evidence early active hemofiltration alters inflammatory response . The researcher test whether ` early ` hemofiltration produce great survival respiratory failure vulnerable population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For child undergo bone marrow transplantation , respiratory failure carry mortality expectation well 60 % . The researcher publish preliminary evidence continuous hemofiltration may greatly improve survival , filtration begin child first fulfill clinical criterion ARDS . This departure standard practice , hemofiltration usually begin later course ( ) multiple organ failure entrench . Hemofiltration , ` renal replacement therapy ` critically ill patient , slow , continuous process semi-permeable membrane remove plasma water solute ( 35 kiloDaltons ) . Many cytokine chemokine molecule small molecular weight limit filter ; hemofiltration might remove critical amount , attenuate unregulated inflammatory response responsible respiratory failure progression multiple organ failure death . The researcher conduct multi-center randomized trial assess effect hemofiltration survival respiratory bone marrow ( precisely , hematopoietic stem cell ) transplantation . The researcher perform sensitive proteomic assay serum ultrafiltrate , detect presence cytokine chemokines know active idiopathic pneumonia syndrome . Resulting profile constitute uniquely complex description ultrafiltrate may provide evidence modulation immune function hemofiltration .</detailed_description>
