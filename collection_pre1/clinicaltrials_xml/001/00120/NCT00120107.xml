	<brief_title>Tea 's Effect Atherosclerosis Pilot Study ( TEA Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tea widely think health benefit , particularly cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The investigator 's group recently find intake 2 cup tea per day associate 44 % low long-term mortality rate abstention tea among 1900 patient hospitalize myocardial infarction . Short-term trial support benefit tea endothelial function , long-term randomized trial tea intake CVD atherosclerosis need test effect tea definitively . The researcher propose proof-of-principle pilot study effect long-term tea intake atherosclerosis . From large hospital-based primary care practice , 30 patient high risk CVD recruit randomized six-month period consumption 3 cup per day either tea , supply black tea solid readily dissolve hot cold liquid , water . The polyphenol content solid confirm baseline , single batch tea throughout study use . At baseline 6 month , aortic atherosclerosis use magnetic resonance imaging , accurate reproducible method measurement arterial plaque size , assess . Adherence use urinary catechin , primary flavonoid tea , measure . The primary outcome compliance tea intake 2 MRI examination . As secondary outcome , standard novel cardiovascular risk marker , include inflammatory , prothrombotic , fibrinolytic , metabolic factor measure . The researcher also assess effect tea consumption oxidizability LDL VLDL cholesterol , use novel affinity-column chromatography approach , endothelial integrity , assess serum marker endothelial function . If successful , pilot study form basis large , long-term randomize trial determine effect tea consumption progression atherosclerosis .</detailed_description>
