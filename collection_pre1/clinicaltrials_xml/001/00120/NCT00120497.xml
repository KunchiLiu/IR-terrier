	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance common among child low birthweight . Moreover , growth hormone treatment ensue short stature also cause insulin resistance . Our objective examine process . Insulin resistance recently link accumulation store fat muscle cell measure MRI . We hypothesize child short due low birthweight increase muscle fat store , growth hormone treatment paradoxically reverse association . To test hypothesis , muscle fat store measure child short due low birthweight receive growth hormone therapy . Other parameter link insulin resistance ( glucose tolerance , blood marker , body composition ) also assess . This study may lead way increase growth hormone safety dose limitation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Examine Insulin Resistance During Growth Hormone Treatment Short Stature Due Low Birthweight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth hormone ( GH ) effective height-enhancing treatment short stature . One underlie disorder intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) . Increased growth enhance quality life well improve body composition , metabolism , lipid distribution . However , GH therapy IUGR cause insulin resistance . Scientists recently link insulin resistance accumulation fat inside muscle cell ( intramyocellular lipid IMCL ) . Although GH generally reduce overall body fat , effect IMCL yet examine . This association examine child IUGR initiate GH treatment short stature . Hypothesis : Children IUGR increase IMCL link insulin resistance , GH treatment may paradoxically reverse association . Objectives : To assess change IMCL GH therapy increase knowledge GH action . Study design : Prepubertal child initiate course GH therapy indicate persistent short stature result IUGR recruit participate crossover study . - IMCL ( soleus tibialis anterior ) measure non-invasively proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) - Body composition measure DEXA morphometry - Whole body insulin sensitivity ( IS ) assess oral glucose tolerance - Levels plasma lipid hormone measure Endpoints : The primary endpoint define effect GH IMCL content IUGR child . Secondary endpoint ( ) compare relationship IMCL IS GH therapy , ( ii ) identify correlative change plasma hormone metabolite may underlie IMCL change . Significance : IMCL anticipate valuable probe understand GH effect glucose homeostasis . This study intend reveal strategy enhance GH efficacy without compromising IS . New pharmacological approach manage GH-induced glucose intolerance would important counteract limiting factor GH dosing .</detailed_description>
