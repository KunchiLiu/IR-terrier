	<detailed_description>Study purpose verify value Implanted Loop Recorder ( ILR ) assess mechanism syncope efficacy ILR-guided therapy documentation syncope recurrence patient suspect certain neurally-mediated syncope initial evaluation . Multi-center , prospective , observational study enrol 400 patient suspect certain neurally-mediated syncope , undergo carotid sinus massage , tilt test ILR implantation . In second phase , start first ILR-documented syncope , study register patient outcome administration ILR-guided therapy , leave discretion physician . Main objective : To verify value ILR assess mechanism syncope efficacy ILR-guided therapy syncope recurrence . Secondary objective : 1 . To define exact mechanism syncope patient suspect certain neurally-mediated syncope base initial evaluation ; 2 . To prospectively evaluate correlation tilt-induced syncope , ATP-induced asystolic response and/or carotid sinus hypersensitivity ILR-documented spontaneous syncope associate bradycardia and/or asystole ; 3 . To assess relationship asymptomatic symptomatic asystole ; 4 . To assess effectiveness pace therapy prevent syncope recurrence patient implanted pacemaker ILR-documented syncope associate asystole/bradycardia . Inclusion criterion : - Suspected certain neurally-mediated syncope , base Guidelines ESC TF Syncope . - 3 syncope episode last 2 year . - Severe clinical presentation syncope require treatment initiation judgement investigator . - Age &gt; 30 year . - Patients undergone carotid sinus massage , ILR implantation . Exclusion criterion : - ILR implanted reason ; case , patient still follow ILR-not implanted group . - Carotid sinus syndrome . - Suspected certain cardiac syncope . - Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension diagnose stand blood pressure measurement . - Loss consciousness different syncope ( e.g . epilepsy , psychiatric , metabolic , drop-attack , TIA , intoxication , cataplexy ) . - Steal syndrome . - Psychologically physically ( due illness ) unfit participation study accord opinion investigator . - Patient compliance doubtful . - Patients geographically otherwise inaccessible follow-up . - Patient unwilling unable give inform consent ; - Pregnancy . - Life expectancy &lt; 1 year due non-cardiac cause . Primary endpoint : Phase 1 : first ECG-documented syncope Phase 2 : first syncope recurrence implementation ILR-guided therapy Secondary endpoint : Phase 1 : - Asymptomatic ILR-documented arrhythmia - ILR-documented pre-syncope/s Phase 2 : - Total number syncopal recurrence - Pre-syncope recurrence Study duration : ISSUE 2 enroll minimum 400 patient anticipated period 3 year . As study continue period 6 month enrollment last patient , total study duration approximately 4 year .</detailed_description>
