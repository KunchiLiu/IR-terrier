	<brief_summary>This study determine brain control movement send message spinal cord muscle . Researchers want know strengthen hand muscle increase strength muscle hand , change happen brain spine , . Plasticity study refers capacity continuous change neural pathway brain nervous system . Researchers see case use muscle extensively ( force production ) one muscle group increase strength muscle group opposite side body ( force transfer ) . This situation happen without unused muscle become larger-suggesting practice cause change part brain spine . It vital scientist know effect work , create new rehabilitation method people move difficulty move one side body . Patients age 18 60 good health history major condition affect bone , joint nervous system may eligible study . Patients undergo medical examination . There 1 2 testing session , 20 training session , 1 2 final testing session , patient ask come laboratory 4 time ( 10 hour total ) 25 visit ( 20 hour total ) . The investigator indicate six different group patient select . During test session , strength pointer little finger hand determine use brief electrical pulse . There also transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) 1 Hz TMS . The researcher place one two wire coil patient 's scalp make mark scalp removed end session . During TMS , brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . Patients hear click sound feel snap sensation skin . They may also feel see small twitch hand muscle , finger wrist may move . There total 300 magnetic stimulus , rate 10 pulse per minute . Patients also electromyogram ( EMG ) , procedure record electrical activity muscle activate electrical magnetic stimulation . Metal electrodes attached skin muscle . During EMG , patient ask tense certain muscle slightly . Depending group patient assign , may ask use right index finger use voluntary muscle movement , electrical stimulation , imagination , electrical stimulation different hand muscle , voluntary movement immediately follow repetitive TMS . Regardless group assignment , five block 10 repetition finger exercise per session , 200 per week , 1,000 throughout whole study . During study session , patient able talk move around . They take break leave room need . In case , session take less 2 hour . There also control group whose member train finger participate test session . TMS safe procedure ; however , strong contraction scalp muscle know cause headache . Also , distract noise TMS , patient fit earplugs wear procedure . Compensation research-related discomfort inconvenience make participant , maximum $ 500 $ 600 , depend assignment group . This study direct benefit participant . However , researcher hope gain information help well understand two side brain control movement affect regard movement control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Strength training limb muscle one side body produce functionally clinically meaningful increase motor output muscle opposite side body . Such adaptation occur without muscle hypertrophy , imply role ipsilateral motor cortex spinal cord force transfer . The goal project determine interhemispheric spinal mechanism force transfer healthy young adult . We hypothesize effect unilateral practice interhemispheric inhibition ( IHI ) excitability contralateral corticospinal projection link , effect grade accord nature muscle activation . In series experiment healthy adult age 18 60 , characterize motor cortical inhibitory excitatory mechanism interhemispheric practice-induced transfer muscle force . We use longitudinal design include three exercise group . In 20 session 4 week , subject strengthen first dorsal interosseus ( FDI ) muscle dominant hand either voluntary , electrically stimulate , imagined contraction . The design also include three control group , sham-stimulated group , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( 1HzTMS ) group , no-intervention group . Before train program , determine change outcome measure , include voluntary electrical stimulation evoke force train untrained FDI . Measures excitability involve uninvolved motor cortex , assess TMS , measure spinal cord excitability , assess peripheral nerve stimulation , additional outcome measure . The result study substantially increase understanding central nervous system ( CNS ) control voluntary movement health disease .</detailed_description>
