	<detailed_description>The incidence premature low birthweight ( LBW ) birth continue climb U.S. despite increase effort prevent . Interventions enhance cop parent infant attempt improve parent child outcome keep pace rapid technological advance sustain survival medically compromised infant . Consequently , urgent need develop evaluate coping intervention parent LBW premature infant order facilitate effective clinical practice strategy empirically base . The primary objective study evaluate short- long-term effect theoretically-driven intervention program ( COPE : Creating Opportunities Parent Empowerment ) process outcomes mother fathers/significant others ' ( SOs ) cop LBW premature infant infant developmental outcomes . The secondary objective : - Explore cop process outcome mother fathers/significant others together contribute outcome LBW premature infant ; - Determine cost-effectiveness COPE program ; - Explore factor moderate effect intervention ( e.g. , family structure , SES , birthweight , disability , infant temperament ) . In randomized clinical trial , investigator test follow hypothesis separately mother fathers/significant others : - Mothers/fathers receive COPE program report less anxiety , depression , stress relate NICU environment mothers/fathers receive comparison program ; - Mothers/fathers receive COPE program demonstrate high quality parent hospitalization mothers/fathers receive comparison program ; - Mothers/fathers receive COPE program report less anxiety depression follow hospitalization mothers/fathers receive comparison program ; - Mothers/fathers receive COPE program perceive child less vulnerable mothers/fathers receive comparison program ; - Fathers receive COPE program report great involvement infant ' life ( average time spent infant per week ) father receive comparison program ; - Infants mothers/fathers receive COPE program great cognitive development infant mothers/fathers comparison program ; - Children mothers/fathers COPE program less negative behavior 2 year correct age child mothers/fathers comparison program ; - The propose model explain effect COPE program process outcomes parental cop infant outcome support mother father . In addition , follow study question answer : - How parental belief cop outcome mother father together contribute outcome LBW premature infant ? - Are reciprocal effect parent child outcomes well parental emotional functional cop outcome ? - How infant cognitive development parental cop outcome change time within subject experimental group ? - What factor moderate effect intervention child outcome ( e.g. , family structure , SES , birth-weight , disability , infant temperament ) ? - What incremental cost COPE intervention compare comparison group , health care sector perspective consider ? - What incremental cost COPE intervention compare comparison group intervention , societal perspective consider ? - How sensitive finding economic evaluation assumption parameter estimate make analysis ? The first 3 year life quality early parent-child relation principal building block adult cognitive emotional functioning . However , investigator find parent impaired relationship premature infant , provide heighten stimulation infant inappropriate time hop increase responsiveness . These dysfunctional pattern place parent risk negative emotion parent outcomes place child risk emotional , behavioral , developmental problem . Therefore , early intervention critical decrease negative effect prematurity parent parent-infant interaction . Early intervention may critical key future successful program parent premature infant recognize , trajectory parent-infant interaction initiate , change difficult implement even hard sustain ; program potential benefit significant number LBW premature infant parent across country . A randomized block design repeat measure use . Subjects two study site randomly assign COPE comparison group 4-week period time . Using random assignment site allow assessment interaction effect part data analytic strategy . Based average NICU stay pilot study ( mean = 29.6 day ) , decision use 4-week block time make decrease likelihood parent parent staff parent contamination would likely individual randomization . The COPE program provide parent : ( ) information appearance behavioral characteristic premature infant information parent participate infant 's care , meet infant 's need , enhance quality interaction infant , facilitate infant 's development ( parental role information ) ; ( b ) activity assist parent implement experimental information . The content COPE program driven theoretical framework , developmental theory , literature review , intervention find effective previous study , prior work research team . The COPE program consist 7 phase . Phase I ( within 2 4 day infant 's NICU admission ) consist audiotaped information . A write copy information also provide parent read listen audiotape . Also , parent give first set parenting activity consist : ( ) identify special characteristic baby ; ( b ) keep record milestone baby achieves NICU . Phase II ( within 2 4 day first intervention ) consist audiotaped write information reinforce critical content initial audiotape provide supplemental information : ( ) premature infant ' behavior development ; ( b ) suggestion regard parent participate infant 's care enhance infant 's development . Additional activity introduce parent consist : ( ) identify special characteristic baby time ; ( b ) recognize baby 's stress cue well cue signal readiness communication . The parent activity design : ( ) supplement mother father ' exist parenting repertoire provide parent activity specific situation ; ( b ) increase parent ' confidence certainty regard best meet infant 's need ; ( c ) enhance infant developmental outcome . Phase III ( 1 4 day prior infant 's discharge home ) consist developmentally appropriate information , include specific detail infant state best time mother father interact infant . The audiotape also contain parental role information regard smooth transition hospital home well continue foster positive mother/father-baby relationship . Parent activity Phase III include : ( ) continue assist parent recognize baby 's cue ; ( b ) help parent recognize strategy help baby stress . The Phase III intervention plan window time discharge home empirically support stressful transition parent . Phase IV ( within 1 week discharge ) deliver parent ' home . Audiotaped information time contain information specific continue growth development infant suggestion foster positive parent-infant relationship . Further parent activity give mother father outline specific thing infant foster cognitive development ( e.g . age appropriate game song ) . One activity book , The Little Engine Could , parent read infant . Emphasis place upon interact infant receptive stimulus ( e.g. , quiet alert state ) . Phase V ( 2 month correct age ) also deliver parent ' home . Parents receive audiotaped write information appropriate upcoming developmental milestone enhance infant 's development . Emphasis place specific age-appropriate information : ( ) infant 's developmental characteristic ; ( b ) typical sleep , cry , temperament pattern ; ( c ) strategies foster infant 's cognitive social development . The COPE information place emphasis assess infant base correct versus chronological age . Parenting activity phase intervention include : ( ) rattle play ; ( b ) play `` peek-a-boo '' ; ( c ) repeat action ; ( ) taste touch explore ; ( e ) vocalize take turn . At Phase VI ( 9 month correct age ) parent provide audiotaped information : ( ) educate regard expect infant 's upcoming development ; ( b ) provide suggestion enhance child 's development . Because mother LBW premature infant frequently continue view child `` fragile '' preschool year engage overprotective parenting , intervention focus importance let toddler engage autonomy , exploration , self-initiation , self-assertion . The COPE information outline parent strategy foster positive attribute child addition teach age-appropriate limit . Parenting activity enhance development phase include : ( ) learn mean `` '' ; ( b ) learning color size ; ( c ) finger-painting ; ( ) reading ; ( e ) identify body part . Phase VII ( 18 month correct age ) information continue emphasize importance allow child develop autonomy , self-initiation , appropriate exploration . Detailed information adverse effect overprotective parenting provide . Parents give information engage appropriate limit set discipline well strategy continue foster cognitive social development toddler . The following parent-child activity provide : ( ) playdough paint-recipes fun ; ( b ) matching object picture ; ( c ) learn sort ; ( ) remember thing belong ; ( e ) learn imitate two word phrase ; ( f ) recognize naming picture . The comparison program also consist series audiotape deliver time 7 phase COPE program . Phases I II audiotaped write information contain information hospital service . The Phase III audiotape contain discharge information give parent . The audiotape provide Phase IV intervention contain information regard immunization . Phases V VII audiotaped write intervention focus age appropriate child safety nutrition issue .</detailed_description>
