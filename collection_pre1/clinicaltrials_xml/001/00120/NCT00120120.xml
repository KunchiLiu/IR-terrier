The pain must primarily lower leg radiate ankle foot . History painful radiculopathy involve one distal low extremity great equal 6 month MRI CT scan within past 2 year recent symptom change Positive straight leg raising ( SLR ) test index ipsilateral leg ( pain radiate knee elevation &lt; 60 degree ) . In presence bilateral leg pain , leg severe pain designated index leg . Screening ( Visit 1 ) : Radiculopathy PINRS score must least 5 11point ( 010 ) PINRS Randomization ( Visit 2 ) : Average radiculopathy PINRS score randomization purpose base AM PM assessment make 7 day prior randomization : 1 . At least eight radiculopathy PINRS score 7day period require 2 . Average radiculopathy PINRS score period must least 5 11point ( 010 ) PINRS . Stable dos tricyclic antidepressant , AEDs , mexiletine hydrochloride , dextromethorphan , capsaicin , NSAIDs , opioids medication ( include prn radiculopathy medication usage ) could affect symptom painful radiculopathy least 28 day prior randomization ( Visit 2 ) .
