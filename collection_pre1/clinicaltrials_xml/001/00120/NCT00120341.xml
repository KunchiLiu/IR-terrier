	<brief_title>Anodyne Therapy Diabetic Sensory Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The morbidity , direct cost mortality associate low extremity complication among patient diabetes mellitus well described medical literature . Peripheral sensory neuropathy one strong risk factor foot ulceration amputation population . In absence neuropathy people rarely develop foot ulcer . Because lack painful feedback , peripheral neuropathy provide permissive environment allow repetitive tissue injury occur person may wear hole bottom foot much way may wear hole stocking . Certainly , early detection level peripheral neuropathy sufficient contribute development foot wound “ loss protective sensation ” one important criterion identify high risk patient foot complication paramount institute structure treatment plan prevent low extremity complication . The objective study determine efficacy application series Anodyne in-home treatment 90-day period improve peripheral sensation self-reported quality life person diabetes mellitus . This pilot study provide preliminary data determine additional clinical evaluation warrant determine appropriate sample size . The hypothesis Anodyne therapy improve sensory function course therapy compare sham therapy .</detailed_description>
