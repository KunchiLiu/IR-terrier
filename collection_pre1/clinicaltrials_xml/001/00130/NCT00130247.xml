	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) serious infection affect lung part body . The usual way treat TB take 4 medicine mouth every day 2 month , take 2 medicine 4 month , total 6 month . The purpose study see take 4 month TB medicine effective cure TB patient take 6 month TB medicine . Study participant include 758 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -non-infected individual , age 18-60 . Participants treat 4 standard drug call isoniazid , rifampicin , pyrazinamide ethambutol . All individual take TB medicine least 4 month . After 4 month treatment , TB germs grow sputum sample , participant assign either stop take TB medicine ( 4 month treatment ) continue take TB drug 2 month ( 6 month treatment ) . Participants involve study procedure 30 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tuberculosis Treatment Shortening Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) major global health problem . TB current lead cause death due identifiable infectious agent worldwide . One high priority tuberculosis control program shorten anti-TB treatment maintain effectiveness . Current 6-month short course chemotherapy regimens 95 % effective treatment tuberculosis fully administer . Six month long time , however , patient frequently discontinue anti-TB treatment symptom improve . The duration standard short course chemotherapy one major obstacle successful application pose substantial challenge program respect patient adherence , program resource need , logistical requirement directly observe therapy . The primary objective study assess efficacy shorten anti-TB treatment 4 month human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -non-infected adults drug-susceptible , non-cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis convert sputum culture negative 2 month treatment . Secondary objective study include : compare pre-treatment sputum bacillary load patient without cavitary disease ; compare time inoculation BACTEC Mycobacteria growth indicator tube ( MGIT ) liquid culture medium positive semi-quantitative sputum acid fast bacteria ( AFB ) smear culture solid medium measure pre-treatment sputum bacillary load ; determine influence immunologic characteristic subject pre-treatment , treatment end therapy rate bacillary clearance risk relapse . A total 758 HIV-non-infected adult , male female , 18-60 year age , newly diagnose initial episode sputum AFB smear-positive -negative , culture-positive , non-cavitary , drug-susceptible pulmonary TB sputum culture negative 2 month anti-TB treatment randomly assign complete total 4 6 month anti-TB therapy . The experimental regimen include total 4 month anti-TB treatment [ 2 month daily isoniazid ( INH ) , rifampicin , pyrazinamide ethambutol follow 2 month daily INH rifampicin ] . The comparative regimen include total 6 month standard short course anti-TB chemotherapy ( 2 month daily INH , rifampicin , pyrazinamide ethambutol follow 4 month daily INH rifampicin ) . Subjects involve study related procedure approximately 30 month begin initial anti-TB treatment .</detailed_description>
