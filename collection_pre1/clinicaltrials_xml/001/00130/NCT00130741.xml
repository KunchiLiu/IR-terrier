	<brief_title>Combination Herbal Therapy ( CHT ) Versus Placebo Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : IBS ( Irritable Bowel Syndrome ) disorder motility entire GI tract produce cramping , abdominal pain , constipation , and/or diarrhea sometimes pass mucus bowel movement . In people IBS , GI tract highly sensitive many stimulus , include diet distension gas . Among dietary suspect high-fat high-calorie meal , dairy product , wheat , citrus fruit , coffee , tea trigger spasm colon muscle . During episode , GI tract contraction become strong frequent , result rapid motility may lead diarrhea . When colon motility reduce , bowel movement occur regularly , result constipation . Cramping appear induce strong contraction increase sensitivity pain receptor large intestine . IBS trigger intensified stress due communication central nervous system nervous system small large intestine . This sometimes referred brain-gut connection support inspection electroencephalogram ( EEG ) trace show significantly great EEG abnormality IBS patient ( 29.2 % ) control ( 4.2 % ) [ p &lt; 0.02 ] . The degree abnormality positively correlate colonic motility IBS patient ( p &lt; 0.05 ) allow author conclude electrophysiologic brain-gut interaction IBS . IBS cause great physical discomfort embarrassment many sufferer , life threaten . There current consensus organic cause syndrome generally appear sign disease upon physical examination except tenderness large intestine . The diagnosis symptom-based , usually identification ROME II criterion IBS . These criterion accept worldwide clinician researcher standard IBS diagnosis follow : At least 12 week , need consecutive , precede 12 month abdominal discomfort pain two three feature : - Relieved defecation ; and/or - Onset associate change frequency stool ; and/or - Onset associate change form ( appearance ) stool . In addition follow symptom cumulatively support diagnosis IBS : - Abnormal stool frequency ( research purpose `` abnormal '' may define &gt; 3/day &lt; 3/week ) ; - Abnormal stool form ( lumpy/hard loose/ watery stool ) ; - Abnormal stool passage ( strain , urgency , feel incomplete evacuation ) ; - Passage mucus ; - Bloating feel abdominal distension . The prevalence rate IBS 1998 U.S. approximately 5,700 case per 100,000 person , much high rate Caucasians Hispanics Afro-Americans . The total direct cost IBS , include cost inpatient outpatient health service utilization prescription medication , great $ 1.6 billion annually 1998 U.S. , indirect cost , primarily absenteeism work , estimate $ 20 billion . ( 1 AGA : The burden gastrointestinal disease ) IBS treat primarily physician 's office , patient education , assurance and/or dietary lifestyle modification rule mild case , prescription medicine offer moderate case . Prescription therapy theses patient generally fall two category - drug affect gut physiology psychological treatment . Very severe case may treat centrally-acting agent ( i.e. , tricyclic antidepressant [ TCAs ] selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) together psychological method . Among medication generally use affect gut physiology abdominal pain antispasmodic , tricyclic antidepressant ( TCAs ) , loperamide , Cholestyramine ( patient cholecystectomy may idiopathic bile acid malabsorption ) serotonergic agent ( 5-HT3 receptor antagonists 5-HT4 receptor agonist ) . These agent show relative success improve individual symptom , effective specific subgroup patient ( e.g.- diarrhea-predominant , constipation-predominant IBS , visa versa ) . Due heterogeneity IBS , effective therapy one may often lead deterioration another . For example , Alosetron , extensively study 5-HT3 antagonist show statistically significant improvement woman diarrhea-predominant IBS , cause constipation 20-30 % patient , clear evidence benefit men . There many known side effect anticholinergic antispasmodic TCAs , : headache , dry mouth , cough , blur vision , constipation , dysuria ; postural hypotension ; tachycardia , decreased libido ; erectile failure ; increase sensitivity sun ; weight gain ; sedation , increase sweating . Loperamide side effect include : Stomach ache , nausea , vomit , bloating , constipation , dry mouth , drowsiness dizziness , cholestyramine know cause constipation , heartburn , indigestion , nausea , vomit , stomach pain , cause tumor animal study . These profile suggest need safer , tolerable comprehensive therapy IBS . Psychological treatment initiate symptom severe enough impair health-related quality life . Mental health referral may also make treatment associate psychiatric disorder major depression . These method include cognitive-behavioral treatment , dynamic ( interpersonal ) psychotherapy , hypnosis , stress management/relaxation . Though benefit see therapeutic method relief abdominal pain , diarrhea anxiety , constipation improve , effect various subgroup patient investigate . ( 4 AGA Med Pos Stat ) CHT : Some Botanical therapy , specifically combination therapy , test treatment IBS positive result . STW 5 ( 9 plant extract ) STW 5-II ( 6 plant extract ) significantly well placebo reduce abdominal pain IBS symptoms 4 week therapy . Additionally , various botanical therapy show effective different degree relief symptom improve quality life non-ulcer functional dyspepsia ( condition similar IBS ) . These include follow therapy test trial receive rating three Jadad score ( validated instrument score 0-5 assessment clinical trial quality ) : celandine extract , turmeric , peppermint caraway oil , Iberogast ( peppermint leave , caraway fruit , without bitter candy tuft fruit , licorice root , lemon balm leaf , angelica root , celandine herb , milk thistle fruit chamomile flower ) , peppermint &amp; caraway &amp; wormwood &amp; fennel , peppermint oil ginger extract , artichoke leaf extract many others low Jadad score rating . A number herb use successfully IBS , well . These include peppermint oil ( enteric coat ) , globe artichoke leaf extract , Chinese herbal medicine . The active ingredient CHT use folklore medicine many century treatment gastrointestinal disease approve Israel Ministry Health marketing distribution pharmacy . A dose toxicity test conduct rat show no-observed-adverse-effect-level male rat dose much high dose utilized study ( measure per Kg body mass ) . Considering ethno-pharmacological preclinical evidence efficacy broad array condition safety principal active ingredient , , investigator Hadassah Medical Organization , decide embark upon clinical development plan gear towards investigation gastrointestinal protective therapeutic property safety principal active ingredient . The first study efficacy trial herein describe . Rationale study : HCT new combination botanical drug substance promise value treat various pathology gastrointestinal tract , due 's presumed `` gastroprotective '' and/or `` gastrosynchronic '' quality . To test hypothesis , daily oral dose HCT self-administered patient IBS . The dose use presume exceptionally safe 37 time low standard daily dose . STUDY OBJECTIVE : To determine safety , tolerability effectiveness , 25 mg per day HCT ( 20 mg principal active ingredient ) compare placebo subject ROME II IBS criterion . Basic Design Characteristics Rationale : This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , parallel group study assess safety efficacy CHT . 100 subject ROME II criterion IBS provide inform consent undergo screening procedure . Subjects fulfil eligibility requirement randomize one two treatment arm ( receive subject number ) . After two-week baseline observation period , reconfirm eligibility , subject allot enough study drug self administration daily dose 25 mg CHT placebo , 4 week . The Week 4 clinic visit follow four week follow-up period without treatment . The day randomization week -2 visit start study treatment Week 0 study visit . Throughout study follow tool utilized ( variable assess ) : subject diary ( documentation concomitant medication concomitant medication change adverse event ) IBS-36 Questionnaire ( assessment treatment-induced change IBS-specific Quality Life score ) , 6-point Likert Scale IBS symptom severity score . This tool develop specifically study , base , part , similar scale publish literature . This early phase study well-designed investigate safety tolerability HCT gain statistically significant efficacy data . The population choose large enough detect clinically significant difference response active study drug placebo arm . The rationale design early stage development base upon recommendation FDA phase I clinical study botanical drug substance .</detailed_description>
