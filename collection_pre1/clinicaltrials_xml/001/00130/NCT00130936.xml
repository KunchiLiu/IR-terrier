	<brief_summary>Although decline incidence , gastric/gastroesophageal cancer still commonly diagnosed malignancy Canada . Patients undergone surgical resection early disease high rate local recurrence distant spread . More 50 % patient present either locally advanced metastatic disease . Patients advanced disease extremely poor prognosis , average survival time range 3 - 9 month . Development new therapeutic approach locally advance metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal cancer , clearly need . Despite proven efficacy , ECF ( epirubicin , cisplatin , infusional 5-fluorouracil [ 5-FU ] ) widely adopt North America likely due technical difficulty inconvenience associate infusional chemotherapy . This study substitute oral chemotherapy drug capecitabine infusional 5-FU addition substitute intravenous cisplatin carboplatin ( ECC - epirubicin , carboplatin capecitabine ) . It hop substitution reduce typical ECF related adverse effect also allow convenient administration outpatient chemotherapy . It also hop genetic correlate study may also identify specific population preferentially benefit ECC treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Epirubicin ( Pharmorubicin® ) , Carboplatin ( Paraplatin® ) Capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) ( ECC ) Treatment Unresectable Locally Advanced Metastatic Gastric/Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer With Pharmacogenetic Correlates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Information : Capecitabine orally administer systemic prodrug 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine convert 5-fluorouracil . Capecitabine readily absorb gastrointestinal tract hydrolyze liver . Capecitabine study treatment gastric/gastroesophageal cancer addition wide variety malignancy ( e.g . GI , breast ) . Objectives Phase I : Primary Objective : - To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) capecitabine combine fix dos epirubicin carboplatin patient advance solid cancer . With identification MTD , determination recommend phase II dose make used evaluate specific anti-tumor activity ECC unresectable locally advanced and/or metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal cancer . Secondary Objectives : - To describe safety , toxicity profile , principle dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) ECC give schedule ; - To determine pharmacokinetic behavior capecitabine give combination epirubicin carboplatin part ECC regimen . Phase II : Primary Objective - To determine anti-tumor activity ECC give RPTD patient unresectable locally advanced and/or metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal cancer receive prior palliative chemotherapy . Secondary Objectives - To characterize toxicity profile ECC regimen ; - To determine time progression , duration response , overall survival patient study ; - To determine effect thymidylate synthase ( TS ) polymorphism toxicity efficacy ECC prospectively genotyped patient ; - To prospectively evaluate potential pharmacogenetic correlate may also play role augment toxicity , include MTHFR ; - To assess effect uridine glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 ( UGT 2B7 ) polymorphism epirubicin metabolism . Study Design : This Phase I/II trial study safety well efficacy ECC combination chemotherapy regimen . Epirubicin : administer IV push fix dose 50mg/m2 day 1 - repeat every 21 day Carboplatin : administer IV , fix dose AUC 5 ( 1-hour infusion 500ml 5 % dextrose ) day 1 - repeat every 21 day Capecitabine : administer twice daily oral medication ( variable dose phase I portion trial , fix dose phase II portion trial ) 14 consecutive day ( day 1-14 ) - repeat every 21 day For phase I portion study cohort 3 patient treat 3 pre-determined dose level capecitabine monitor toxicity : - Dose level 1 : 750 mg/m2 bid - Dose level 2 : 850 mg/m2 bid - Dose level 3 : 1000 mg/m2 bid - Dose level 4+ : 25 % dose escalation ( rounded near twice day dose ) . Statistical Analysis Phase I : Summary statistic frequency intensity toxicity occur dose level provide . The percentage patient develop DLT dose level compute . The dose-toxicity curve estimate accordingly use either parametric non-parametric method . Phase II : A Simon 's optimal two-stage phase II study conduct patient unresectable locally advanced metastatic gastric gastro-esophageal cancer RPTD ECC regimen . A total sample size 43 patient require , 13 first stage 30 second stage , criterion second stage accrual met . If &lt; =3/13 patient respond , deem correspond initial rejection limit patient enrol . If &gt; =4/13 patient respond , additional 30 patient enrolled second stage ( total sample size = 43 ) . Further statistical detail specifically outline Section 8 protocol . The response rate , standard error 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) calculate binomial distribution model . The efficacy regimen evaluate compare point estimate 95 % CI historical data . Potential covariates response also identify evaluate via logistic regression model . Kaplan-Meier estimate compute estimate secondary endpoint time progression survival . Cox-regression model apply incorporate covariates model . Fisher 's exact test apply compare response rate different genetic TS polymorphism grouping . Stopping Rules : Treatment discontinue patient come trial therapy due severe intercurrent illness , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient request stop , and/or physician deems best interest patient discontinue . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Patient Population : Phase I - Histologically cytologically confirm solid tumor refractory conventional cytotoxic anticancer therapy , standard therapy reasonable therapeutic index . Phase II - Inoperable/unresectable locally advanced and/or metastatic , histologically ( cytologically ) confirm adenocarcinoma undifferentiated carcinoma stomach gastro-esophageal junction present first line palliative systemic treatment . Prior adjuvant chemoradiotherapy gastric gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma allow long patient complete adjuvant therapy &gt; = 6 month prior study entry . Patients need least one site measurable disease define RECIST criterion . Inclusion : In general , participate study , patient must 18 year old , expect life expectancy &gt; 12 week , WHO performance status 0-2 , LVEF MUGA &gt; 50 % , adequate organ function : hematological ( ANC &gt; 1.5X 10^9/L , platelet &gt; 100 x 10^9/L , hepatic ( bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN , AST/ALT &lt; 3 x ULN ) , renal ( calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min ) . Negative pregnancy test females child-bearing potential . Prior radiotherapy allow must deliver &lt; 25 % bone marrow , must complete &gt; 4 week study entry patient must recover side effect radiotherapy . Radiation must deliver sole response indicator lesion , unless document evidence disease progression site completion radiation . Patients must able reliably tolerate comply oral/feeding tube administer medication ( patient consider eligible investigator deem malabsorption syndrome GI obstruction would impair delivery orally administer chemotherapy ) . If patient prior anthracycline , cumulative dose must &lt; 300mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent . Exclusion : Patients currently enrol another clinical trial involve active cancer treatment . Treatment doxorubicin &gt; 300mg/m2 equivalent . Serious medical condition include myocardial infarction within 6 month prior entry , unstable angina , active cardiomyopathy , unstable ventricular arrhythmia , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled psychotic disorder , serious active infection , uncontrolled diabetes medical condition might aggravate study treatment . Pre-existing neuropathy &gt; grade 1 , history seizure patient receive anti-epileptic prophylaxis , active progressive brain leptomeningeal metastasis , pregnant lactate woman , patient evidence recent history drug alcohol abuse , prior treatment capecitabine infusional 5-FU , know hypersensitivity carboplatin , 5-FU , anthracyclines know DPD deficiency .
