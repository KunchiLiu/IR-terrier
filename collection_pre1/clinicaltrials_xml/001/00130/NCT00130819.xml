	<brief_title>Comparison HIV Clinic-based Treatment With Buprenorphine Versus Referred Care Heroin-dependent Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We , investigator Johns Hopkins University , propose enroll randomize 120 opioid-dependent , HIV-infected participant , receive care Johns Hopkins HIV Clinic either : - clinic-based care buprenorphine ( clinic-based BPN/NX arm ) ; - case management referral opioid treatment program opioid agonist-based therapy ( case management referral arm ) . The study intervention follow-up last 12 month . Participants enrol 3-year period . Participants assign clinic-based BPN/NX arm receive BPN/NX ( SuboxoneÂ® ) , individual counseling nurse interventionist , group therapy session . Participants assign case management referral arm enrol establish case management adherence program Johns Hopkins HIV Clinic ( Project LINK ) . LINK provide intensive case management , education , support team include social worker , nurse , pharmacist educator , peer advocate . In addition provide counsel linkage need service , LINK expedite intake license opioid treatment program provide agonist-based therapy opioid dependence . The clinic-based BPN intervention new strategy develop pilot project past 6 month . The case-management referral arm represent standard-of-care clinic , enhance codified trial . Study outcome visit perform baseline , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month . Comparisons : - Retention substance abuse treatment ; - Urine drug screen ; - Adherence HIV primary care provider visit ; - Use adherence highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) ; - HIV RNA level CD4 cell count ; - HIV transmission risk behavior ( e.g. , injection , share drug paraphernalia , sexual behavior ) ; - Costs resource utilization .</detailed_description>
