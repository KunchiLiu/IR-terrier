	<criteria>Patients give write informed consent , prior participate trial . Patients either sex &gt; = 40 year age sufficient good health able complete 6month followup . Patients sign symptom osteoarthritis least one knee : Diagnosed accord ACR criterion . Based upon knee Xray perform within 6 month prior Screening , radiograms must classify Grade II III osteoarthritis knee accord Kellgren &amp; Lawrence grade system base upon radiologist 's write report individual certify read knee radiogram . ( Sharpening tibial spine consider osteophyte ) . Patients symptoms consistent osteoarthritis knee least 6 month prior Screening . These symptom must include knee joint pain , may include crepitus , swell and/or effusion knee . At Screening , patient analgesic/antiinflammatory medication visual analogue scale ( VAS ) pain score walking 50 ft flat surface &gt; 30 mm &lt; 90 mm use 100 mm scale . If patient take analgesic/antiinflammatory medication take pain medication ( prescription [ Rx ] overthecounter [ OTC ] ) previous 3 day Screening VAS pain score walk 50 ft flat surface &gt; 40 mm &lt; 90 mm . If bilateral knee pain present , investigator select painful knee . At Screening Baseline , bilateral OA knee involvement , patient must VAS pain score walk 50 ft flat surface &lt; 30 mm less painful contralateral knee Baseline assessment . A patient scoring acceptable VAS pain score Screening fail meet inclusion exclusion criterion Baseline randomize enrol . At Baseline , analgesic/antiinflammatory medication discontinue 2 week ( withdrawal acetaminophen rescue medication least 24 hour prior Baseline assessment ) , patient VAS pain score &gt; 40 mm &lt; 90 mm immediately 50foot walk flat surface . Again , bilateral knee pain present , investigator select painful knee contralateral knee must VAS pain score &lt; 30 mm . Patients must knee pain signal knee least 50 % day month precede Screening . Patients able complete efficacy measurement questionnaire understand read English Spanish ( Spanish form provide ) . Patients perform 50foot walk test without support crutch assistive device , except cane . If patient us cane routinely daily activity , use assessment . However , use must remain stable assessment . Minimum flexion 90 degree knee . Patients willing discontinue nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) analgesic medication take condition , include knee pain exception acetaminophen , 1000 mg ( 2 tablet ) four time day ( q.i.d . ) , need ( p.r.n . ) ( maximum 8 tablet 4 gram per day ) . These patient must willing use acetaminophen rescue pain medication knee pain study period refrain even acetaminophen use 24 hour prior office visit . All analgesic medication chronic condition must stop ( see exception acute treatment transient flare pain ) . Patients must also willing abstain intraarticular ( i.a . ) periarticular injection knee surgery course trial , except assign study product . Patients , currently take low dose aspirin ( 325 mg/day less ) , willing remain stable dose throughout study willing refrain aspirin dose 24 hour prior office visit . Women childbearing potential may enter : pregnancy test ( urine test ) positive , nursing , use effective method contraception followup procedures complete . ( Methods contraception consider effective oral , injectable implant contraceptive agent , intrauterine device failure rate 1 % per year , abstinence ) . Patients participate experimental drug/device study clinical trial within previous 30 day prior Screening . Patients prior history malignancy exception basal cell carcinoma skin treat 2 year prior Screening , unless specific permission/waiver Sponsor grant . Patients significant bleeding diathesis . Patients currently litigation injury relate study knee injury might interfere completion study protocol . Musculoskeletal Related Patients major injury ( include sport ) study knee past 12 month . Patients surgery study joint within previous 12 month prior Screening , surgery contralateral knee weightbearing joint would interfere study assessment . Patients significant surgery low limb ( hip , ankle , foot ) may interfere knee assessment . Patients receive articular procedure , transplant , study knee . Patients ligament reconstruction study knee . Patients inflammatory arthropathy rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , psoriatic arthritis Patients gout calcium pyrophosphate ( pseudogout ) diseases flare within previous 6 month prior Screening . Patients receive intraarticular local periarticular corticosteroid injection study joint/knee within previous 3 month prior Screening . Patients receive intraarticular , intramuscular local periarticular corticosteroid injection joint ( beside study joint ) soft tissue area within past 3 month . Patients receive oral corticosteroid within previous month . Steroid inhalant permit patient stable regimen past month prior Screening remain regimen throughout course trial . Patients receive intraarticular hyaluronan study joint within previous 9 month prior screen . Patients receive intraarticular hyaluronan joint within previous 6 month prior screen . Patients history allergic reaction intraarticular injection avian product . Patients take unstable dos glucosamine chondroitin sulfatecontaining compound , patient take stable dose less 4 month prior Screening , patient take stable dose least 4 month prior unwilling remain stable dos throughout course trial . Patients unstable dos bisphosphonate patient stable dos past month prior Screening , unwilling remain stable dos throughout course trial . Patients perform 50foot walk test without support crutch assistive device , except cane . If patient us cane routinely daily activity , use clinical assessment . If patient us cane Baseline assessment must use cane ALL subsequent assessment . Patients Xray finding acute fracture , severe loss bone density , avascular necrosis and/or severe bone joint deformity . Patients significant axial deviation knee . Patients OA dominantly lateral compartment significant valgus deformity Patients significant anterior knee pain due diagnose isolated patellafemoral syndrome chondromalacia . Patients symptomatic osteoarthritis either hip , contralateral knee spine may interfere functional assessment signal knee . Patients clinically significant mediolateral and/or anteriorposterior instability . Patients osteonecrosis either knee . Patients receive perform physical therapy regimen previous month Screening , and/or maintain stable physical therapy regimen throughout course trial . Patients KellgrenLawrence Grade IV OA ( i.e. , large osteophyte , mark narrowing , severe sclerosis , definite deformity ) Grade I OA knee . Patients arthrogram signal joint within past 3 month prior Screening . Patients hemiparesis low limb Patients active liver renal disease base upon liver profile SGOT &gt; 2 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) , and/or conjugate bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN , and/or renal insufficiency ( serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL , and/or clinically significant laboratory value base clinical history investigator feel may affect evaluation patient . Concomitant condition , disease , medication and/or clinical history Patients require chronic use analgesia pain ( include pain knee joint ) may interfere evaluation test knee ( possible use rescue medication condition ) . Patients known allergy acetaminophen , lidocaine , hyaluronans , avian product . Patients recurrent medical history severe allergic immunemediated reaction . Patients active infection skin near potential injection site . Patients dermatological disease overlie signal joint would contraindicate multiple injection aspiration . Patients take agent report symptom relief arthritis disease/structure modify drug ( e.g . doxycycline , longterm tetracycline , sadenosylmethionine [ SAM ] , dimethyl sulfoxide [ DMSO ] , dietary supplement herbal remedy take arthritic joint condition within past month . Exceptions product contain glucosamine/Chondroitin/methylsulfonylmethane ( MSM ) stable 4 month prior Screening remain stable throughout study fulfill VAS pain entry criterion ) . Patients peripheral neuropathy would severe enough interfere evaluation patient . Patients vascular insufficiency lower limb severe enough interfere evaluation patient . Patients concomitant therapy anticoagulant ( low dose aspirin , exceed 325 mg per day antithrombotic agent permit stable one month prior Screening remain stable throughout study . Patients intercurrent disease ( ) condition ( ) may interfere free use evaluation affect knee 6 month course trial ( cancer , rheumatic disease , gout , severe congenital defect , etc. ) . Patients intercurrent chronic disease ( ) condition ( ) may predispose high probability interfere completion 6 month followup study peptic ulcer , liver disease , severe coronary disease , renal disease , cancer , pregnancy , alcoholism , drug abuse , mental state , clinically significant condition . Patients excessive alcohol consumption alcoholism would contraindicate use acetaminophen . Patients know current addiction pain medication .
