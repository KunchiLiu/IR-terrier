	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness experimental drug eculizumab treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) , disorder cause premature destruction red blood cell . PNH may result anemia require blood transfusion . Patients may high risk life-threatening blood clot vein may urine discoloration , stomach pain , difficulty swallowing , tiredness , poor quality life . Men may problem get maintain erection . Eculizumab monoclonal antibody may improve survival red blood cell patient PNH . Patients 18 year age old diagnose PNH 6 month , active disease , require blood transfusion may eligible study . Each candidate screen physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood urine test , questionnaire information PNH affect patient physically , socially , emotionally , functionally . Participants receive infusion eculizumab needle vein week five dos every two week another 24 dos . All patient vaccinate Neisseria meningitides , bacteria cause symptom , possibly include life-threatening meningitis , susceptible people , include people take eculizumab . At every treatment visit , patient update health status , transfusion record , medication use ; review laboratory result precede visit ; vital sign measure ; provide blood sample laboratory test . At select visit , also provide urine sample , repeat electrocardiogram , complete questionnaire . At final treatment visit , participant complete physical examination , addition routine procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) acquire clonal disorder hematopoietic stem cell characterize intravascular hemolysis , hemoglobinuria , anemia , thrombosis . The clinical feature PNH result lack one GPI-linked protein serve protect cell autologous complement mediate attack . Two protein , CD55 ( decay accelerate factor ) CD59 ( reactive lysis inhibitor ) show absent PNH erythrocytes platelet well cell type . Evidence strongly suggest lack terminal complement inhibitor CD59 responsible sensitivity PNH erythrocytes platelet effect autologous complement . Since pathogenesis PNH due inability PNH red cell platelet inhibit activation terminal complement , logical hypothesize terminal complement inhibitor could effectively stop intravascular hemolysis , obviate lessen need transfusion , possibly decrease propensity life threaten thrombosis . Eculizumab ( h5G1.1-mAb ) humanize monoclonal antibody like CD59 inhibit terminal complement . This study open label , multi-center study eculizumab , administer intravenously 52 week approximately 85 PNH patient . The study design evaluate safety eculizumab transfusion dependent patient paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) determine administration terminal complement inhibitor could provide safe effective substitute CD59 function .</detailed_description>
