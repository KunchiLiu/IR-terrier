	<brief_title>B-type Natriuretic Peptide Acute Shortness Breath EvaLuation ( BASEL ) Study - Private Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Most patient dyspnea primarily consult physician private practice . Heart failure pulmonary disease `` epidemic '' disorder account majority case dyspnea . There approximately 24 million individual United States chronic obstructive pulmonary disease another 10 million person suffer asthma . These illness generate excess 17 million physician office visit year cost $ 10.4 billion . In addition , nearly 1.5 million new case heart failure North America Europe every year . The total direct cost care heart failure exceed $ 38 billion United States per year . Therefore , cost-effective management disease paramount importance . Unfortunately , rapid accurate differentiation heart failure cause dyspnea private practice challenge . The symptoms heart failure may nonspecific , sign sensitive enough considerably overlap pulmonary disease . In addition , sign volume overload take time evolve may completely absent patient acute heart failure . B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) neurohormone secrete cardiac ventricle response ventricular volume expansion pressure overload . BNP level significantly high patient congestive heart failure compare patient dyspnea due cause . Recently , researcher able show use BNP level significantly improve management patient acute dyspnea emergency department . As simple , non-expensive assay easily applicable private practice available , rapid measurement BNP might also helpful establish exclude diagnosis heart failure patient present acute dyspnea private practice . Aim : To test hypothesis BNP guide diagnostic strategy would improve evaluation management patient present acute dyspnea physician private practice thereby reduce total cost diagnosis treatment . Primary endpoint : Total medical cost within 3 month . Secondary endpoint : Hospitalisation , time interval initiation appropriate therapy , 3-month mortality , dyspnea ( NYHA ) 3 month , 12-month mortality , 12-month total medical cost , cost-effectiveness . Patients Methods : The trial design enrol 250 patient present acute dyspnea physician private practice . Patients randomly assign 1:1 control group use evaluation patient accord local standard without use BNP ( natriuretic peptide ) BNP group early test BNP rapid point-of-care assay first consultation private practice . Expected result : It researcher ' hypothesis BNP guide diagnostic strategy improve evaluation management thereby reduce total cost diagnosis treatment . Significance : Given significant morbidity associate dyspnea , well enormous expense associate heart failure pulmonary disease , BNP test could represent major advance clinical medicine . In addition , BNP test appropriate clinical setting may prove helpful attempt reduce cost health care society without reduce ( possibly increase ) quality health care .</detailed_description>
