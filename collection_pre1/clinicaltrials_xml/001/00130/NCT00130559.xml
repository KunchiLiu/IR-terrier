	<brief_title>B-type Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) -Guided Diagnostic Strategy Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) Patients With Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Respiratory failure important reason admission patient medical intensive care unit ( ICU ) , also common reason deterioration patient already treat ICU . It serious condition associate significant mortality . Heart failure common reason respiratory failure circumstance . Unfortunately , rapid accurate differentiation heart failure cause respiratory failure ICU remain clinical challenge . After evaluation symptom , physical examination , arterial blood gas , ECG , chest x-ray , clinician often leave considerable diagnostic uncertainty result misdiagnosis delay initiation appropriate therapy . In addition , misdiagnosis heart failure cause morbidity , increase total treatment time treatment cost , treatment heart failure may hazardous patient condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , vice verse . B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) 32-amino acid polypeptide secrete cardiac ventricle response ventricular volume expansion pressure overload . BNP level significantly high patient congestive heart failure compare patient respiratory failure due cause . Therefore , rapid measurement BNP might helpful establish exclude diagnosis heart failure patient respiratory failure ICU . Aim : The aim test hypothesis BNP guide diagnostic strategy would improve evaluation management patient present primary ( admission ) secondary ( ICU ) respiratory failure ICU thereby reduce total treatment time total cost treatment . Endpoints : Primary endpoint : Time discharge total cost treatment . Secondary endpoint : ICU length stay , ICU cost , In-hospital mortality , 30-day mortality , cost-effectiveness , 6 12 month mortality , 6 12 month dyspnea score . Patients Methods : The trial design enroll 286 patient present primary ( admission ) secondary ( ICU ) respiratory failure ICU . Patients randomly divide 1:1 clinical group use evaluation patient accord local standard without use BNP ( natriuretic peptide ) BNP group early testing BNP . Expected result : The researcher hypothesize BNP guide diagnostic strategy improve evaluation management patient present respiratory failure ICU thereby reduce time discharge total cost treatment . Significance : If fact , BNP test could show improve evaluation management patient respiratory failure ICU , would represent major advance clinical care seriously ill patient , well , highlight potential considerable cost-saving . Accordingly , study would positive result fact demonstrate BNP guide diagnostic strategy reduces total treatment time total cost treatment , would first randomize controlled trial demonstrate new diagnostic test improve evaluation management ICU patient . Given enormous expense associate intensive care , study seem overdue .</detailed_description>
