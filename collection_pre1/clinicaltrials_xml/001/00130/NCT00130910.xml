	<brief_summary>Identifying method slow disease progression patient HIV-1 infection remain top priority many region world . In many country , medication know slow progression readily affordable available . Many individual live country also co-infected variety disease tuberculosis , malaria soil-transmitted helminth . There data suggest infection agent may activate immune system HIV-1 co-infected individual may lead rapid HIV disease progression . This study evaluate potential impact treat helminths HIV-1 seropositive individual . Markers disease progression immune activation assess . We also measure amount virus genital secretion determine treatment co-infection reduce infectiousness HIV individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Helminth co-Infection : Short-Term Effects HIV-1 Progression Markers Immune Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many HIV infected individual live crowd urban setting . These condition associate repeated intestinal parasite infection ( helminth ) , may alter immune system individual HIV AIDS . This alteration immune system may increase susceptibility infection severity infection individual . Prior study show HIV infected individual , intestinal parasite associate increased level HIV virus circulate blood . Studies also clearly show individual HIV , progression AIDS predict quantity HIV virus detectable within blood . It important determine whether treat helminth co-infection patient HIV help individual control HIV infection slow disease progression . The investigator propose study characterize short-term effect antihelminth therapy HIV disease progression , marker immune activation level HIV genital secretion . They also plan determine prevalence helminth infection individual HIV . This study examine factor might affect individual 's risk helminth infection , CD4 count , viral load , age , gender duration time spent urban setting . In addition , investigator conduct randomize clinical trial determine effect treat helminth infection marker immune activation , HIV disease progression risk transmission measure HIV-1 RNA genital secretion . The study conduct group HIV infect individual around Nairobi , Kenya yet meet criterion highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . Identifying inexpensive practical method delay HIV progression offer tremendous public health benefit . At present time , highly active antiretroviral therapy rapidly scale resource poor setting . The demand drug currently far outweigh capacity service provide many region . For million people infect HIV resource poor setting , delay immunosuppression month year could allow important development infrastructure would permit maximum number individual benefit highly active antiretroviral therapy . HIV-1 infected adult invite participate trial . Women whose pregnancy test positive exclude study . A physical examination conduct prospective client , find clinical pallor , sign symptom active tuberculosis , malaria malignancy exclude study . Individuals CD4 count great 250 cells/mm3 enrol study follow write informed consent . HIV-1 infected patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion enrol screening . Stool sample collect enrollment evaluate ova parasite . All patient find positive stool parasite examination consent participate enrol treatment phase study . Those found negative stool specimen continue treatment phase . Baseline demographic socio-economic data collect patient order evaluate prevalence correlate helminth infection among HIV-1 infected individual . Those find infected helminth decline participate treatment phase treat charge three day course albendazole ( 400 mg/day ) study investigator . Those patient enrol treatment phase blood collect baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA level . Computer-generated random number allocation use assign treatment group . The pharmacy Kenya Medical Research Institute responsible determination randomization group distribution albendazole placebo . The pharmacy also responsible maintaining record regard treatment group . Treatment provide form six 200 mg pill albendazole six placebo pill identical appearance . Both placebo albendazole provide identical appear envelope . Treatment arm consist either initial therapy albendazole ( 400 mg per day three day ) two placebo pill per day initially . All patient require visit clinic twelve week enrollment . At twelve week visit , stool sample collect evaluation helminth infection . Plasma CD4 count HIV-1 RNA level measurement repeat twelve week visit . All patient receive placebo initially well patient evidence helminth infection treat open-label albendazole therapy regardless initial treatment arm . At enrollment twelve week visit , lymphocytes also isolated serum sample assessment immune activation marker . Genital HIV-1 RNA level compare 100 individual randomize immediate versus defer antihelminthics baseline 3-month visit ( prior receiving deferred therapy ) . This provide data quantify potential effect anti-helminthic treatment genital HIV-1 RNA . Consenting adult genital swab collect ( semen cervical/vaginal ) place freezing medium prior cryopreservation transport Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center HIV-1 RNA assay . Patients follow-up direct contacted administrative support team home order determine reason loss follow . Any adverse event treatment period report managed accordingly treatment clinic .</detailed_description>
