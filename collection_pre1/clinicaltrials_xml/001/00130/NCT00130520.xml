	<brief_summary>The purpose project determine new combination drug , erlotinib ( Tarceva™ ) bevacizumab safe effective treat woman diagnose ovarian cancer whose cancer progress prior standard chemotherapy treatment taxane ( paclitaxel docetaxel ) platinum ( cisplatin carboplatin ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Erlotinib Study Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib bevacizumab , novel biologics , offer new regimen treatment ovarian cancer woman refractory standard drug regimen . Because bevacizumab anti-angiogenesis drug erlotinib EGFR receptor inhibitor combination would lead inhibition multiple signal transduction pathway reversal cancer progression difficult treat population . The study seek determine efficacy safety EGFR receptor inhibitor , erlotinib plus anti-angiogenesis VEGF ligand inhibitor bevacizumab woman platinum taxane refractory ovarian cancer . The study design non-randomized , open label , single center Phase II trial use Simon two stage design . Eligible patient woman histologically pathologically confirm diagnosis epithelial carcinoma ovary primary peritoneal carcinoma relapse refractory therapy primary treatment disease . Patients treat erlotinib 150 mg/day orally bevacizumab 10mg/kg every two week plus minus one day intravenously . Forty patient enrol study . Initially 20 eligible patient accrue . If one confirm response observe , trial close agent consider inactive . Otherwise , 20 additional eligible patient accrue total 40 patient . Eight responses 40 consider evidence warrant study agent provide factor , progression-free overall survival , also appear favorable . Previous study combination non-small cell lung cancer , renal cell carcinoma metastatic breast cancer indicate potential synergistic effect two agent . Preliminary data use bevacizumab advance ovarian cancer indicate agent single-agent activity . As result , researcher interest explore role combination erlotinib bevacizumab advance ovarian cancer .</detailed_description>
