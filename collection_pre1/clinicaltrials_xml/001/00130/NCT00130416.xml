Patients register online , receive password administrator practice site order confirm patient 's identity . Patients clinician must use confidential password obtain access system . To alert PatientSite user presence message , PatientSite send user traditional email message PatientSite message , along link PatientSite Web portal . DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH PROTOCOL : The researcher conduct randomize , control trial PatientSite intervention design improve pain , depression , impaired mobility among primary care patient , among outcome . The researcher recruit physician currently use PatientSite among practice BIDMC 's academic primary care practice 2 community practice affiliate BIDMC . Patients physician agree participate potentially eligible study . Two week next scheduled primary care office visit , The researcher send patient e-mail invitation via PatientSite participate study . The e-mail briefly describes study ( include procedure randomization ) link patient complete , electronic informed consent form well standard HIPAA disclosure . Patients electronically sign informed consent , thereby agree participate study , send screen questionnaire ask sign symptom chronic pain , depression , difficulty walking . Persons screen positive least one three condition enrol study randomize intervention control group .
