	<brief_title>Transthecal Metacarpal Block Versus Traditional Digital Block Painful Finger Procedures Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Finger injury infection common present problem pediatric emergency department . A traditional digital block , require least two injection anesthetic , traditional method regional anesthesia many finger procedure . Digital block sometimes difficult administer ass effectiveness especially child . A new procedure , transthecal metacarpal block , may easier administer , effective one injection . Objective : To determine transthecal metacarpal block ( MCB ) provide superior digit anesthesia child require painful finger procedure compare traditional digital block ( TDB ) . Methods : A randomized clinical trial compare MCB TDB conduct urban , tertiary care pediatric emergency department . Children &lt; 18 year age , present emergency department finger injury infection , require regional anesthesia repair screen eligibility . Eligible patient , appropriate consent randomize receive either MCB TDB 1 % Lidocaine . The primary outcome , success block assess use pinprick test standardized wait time . Secondary outcome include pain block repair , repair physician satisfaction , short-term complication also assess . Implications : Finding successful method anesthesia pain control paramount pediatric emergency department . In addition , use type digital block easy administer , successful , require one injection would give physician confidence treat finger injuries child regional anesthesia possibly avoid procedural sedation case . To date , study publish efficacy digital block child . This study also serve give baseline success rate type digital block .</detailed_description>
