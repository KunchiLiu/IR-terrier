	<brief_summary>Purpose : There remain great need novel therapeutic agent treatment strategy advance esophagogastric cancer . Preclinical clinical study demonstrate increased EGFR expression significant proportion esophageal gastric carcinoma . Inactivation EGFR use monoclonal antibody preclinical model result inhibition tumor growth . Agents design block EGFR pathway demonstrate disease control among previously treat patient metastatic esophageal gastric cancer . The propose mechanism action cetuximab ability effectively disrupt EGFR-mediated signal transduction pathways ultimately lead halt cell cycle progression , induces apoptosis , also inhibit process important tumor growth , cell invasion angiogenesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess response rate single-agent cetuximab patient advance esophageal gastric cancer fail 1-2 prior chemotherapy regimen give metastatic setting . Secondary - To evaluate duration response , progression-free survival overall survival . - To assess safety cetuximab . Exploratory - To assess whether level EGFR expression and/or EGFR mutation status correlate response toxicity cetuximab . STATISTICAL DESIGN : This study use two-stage design evaluate efficacy cetuximab base overall response ( OR ) define complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) . The null alternative OR rate 5 % 15 % . If one patient enrol stage one cohort ( n=20 patient ) achieve PR well accrual would proceed stage two ( n=16 patient ) . There 36 % probability stop trial stage one true OR rate 5 % . The probability regimen would consider promising true OR rate 5 % 10 % 80 % true OR rate 15 % .</detailed_description>
