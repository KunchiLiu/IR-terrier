	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness monoclonal antibody call humanize anti-Tac ( HAT , also call daclizumab ) treat child adolescent uveitis ( chronic inflammatory eye disease ) associate juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) . Monoclonal antibody genetically engineer protein make large quantity direct specific target body . The HAT antibody design prevent specific chemical interaction need immune cell produce inflammation . Current treatment uveitis include steroid immune-suppressing drug . These treatment always work may cause significant side effect . This study determine whether daclizumab improve uveitis child reduce need medicine . Patients 6 18 year age active non-infectious JIA-associated uveitis require treatment anti-inflammatory medication often three time day may eligible study . Each candidate screen medical history , physical examination , blood test , eye examination , follow specialized test : - Fluorescein angiography evaluate eye 's blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate presence inflammation . - Optical coherence tomography measure retinal thickness . The eye examine machine produce cross-sectional picture retina . These measure repeat study determine change , , retinal thickening . - Stereoscopic color fundus photography examine back eye . The pupil dilate eye drop examine photograph back eye . Upon enter study , participant receive 90-minute infusion daclizumab catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm vein . They return clinic 14 day 28 day repeat eye examination , blood test , daclizumab infusion . Four week third infusion , patient examine response treatment . Those benefited daclizumab may continue receive monthly infusion drug one year . A blood test eye examination do time infusion . Patients whose disease remain active 12 week first infusion take study treat medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Anti-Tac ( Daclizumab ) Treat Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ( JIA ) -Associated Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric uveitis represent 5-10 % patient uveitis . Uveitis refers intraocular inflammatory disease . The common type non-infectious pediatric uveitis , associate systemic disease , JIA-associated chronic , anterior uveitis . Therapeutic consideration pediatric uveitis often challenge . Current therapeutic modality include corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent . These modality always effective control disease . In addition also associate high rate ocular side effect . To add challenge , pediatric uveitis high rate ocular complication , even current therapy . Consequently , effective treatment safer side effect profile highly desirable . Daclizumab humanize monoclonal antibody direct high affinity interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor CD25 Tac subunit . The IL-2 receptor system play central role mediate immune response . Blocking system impedes immune response inhibit local inflammatory response , include uveitis . Pilot study use intravenous subcutaneous daclizumab treatment suggest daclizumab treatment 2 mg/kg every 2-4 week quiescent uveitis may effectively replace immunosuppressive medication majority case . Because little experience use daclizumab active uveitis pediatric population , feasibility study enroll seven study participant would normally treat systemic , high-dose corticosteroid cytotoxic , systemic immunosuppressive medication . Since daclizumab indication tolerate repeated dose 8-10 mg/kg , administer daclizumab reach high serum level pair dose 8 mg/kg 4 mg/kg two week apart . The primary objective study collect preliminary information utility acute daclizumab therapy active ocular inflammation pediatric population . The primary outcome resolution active disease define two step reduction anterior chamber cell scale baseline . Safety assessment make 28 day efficacy assessment 8 week initial daclizumab injection . Secondary outcome include fluorescein retinal vascular leakage , cystoid macular edema , vitreous haze visual acuity . In addition adverse event collect regardless possible relation daclizumab . Participants meet safety end point day 28 permit continue IV daclizumab maintenance treatment begin Day 28 2 mg/kg every 4 week . An efficacy assessment make 8 week , patient show 2 step reduction intraocular inflammation , meet safety end point , continue daclizumab treatment 2mg/kg every 4 week total 52 week study . At time follow-up period , participant lose great 3 line visual acuity baseline study , meet safety end point , treatment discontinue . The primary objective feasibility study gain preliminary information regard safety possible efficacy daclizumab treat active uveitis , associate JIA . The primary focus feasibility study short acute response trial relatively high-dose daclizumab infusion observe anterior cell flare associate active JIA-associated uveitis promptly reduce . In order qualify enrollment , participant must meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion . This study enroll seven participant National Eye Institute ( NEI ) currently active JIA-associated active uveitis . Enrollment expect take approximately three month . The two induction treatment complete within 14 day , primary safety evaluation Day 14 Day 28 primary efficacy assessment 12 week . An induction regimen intravenous ( IV ) daclizumab 8 mg/kg give Day 0 follow another IV dose 4 mg/kg Day 14 , provide safety endpoint meet . An efficacy assessment make 12 week , patient show 2-step reduction intraocular inflammation , meet safety endpoint , continue daclizumab therapy . Meeting safety failure criterion serious adverse affect attributable daclizumab therapy cause termination daclizumab study treatment . Continuing follow-up standard-of-care alternative treatment potentially reduced visit schedule provide duration trial daclizumab treatment suspend . After trial , participant may seek standard-of-care treatment physician ophthalmologist may eligible enroll research trial available . Participants show 2-step reduction ocular inflammation decrease inactivity , without serious adverse event , option receive extend treatment 2 mg/kg IV daclizumab treatment 4-week interval , begin day 28 , total 52 week study .</detailed_description>
