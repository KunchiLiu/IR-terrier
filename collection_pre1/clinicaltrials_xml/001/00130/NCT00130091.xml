	<brief_summary>The current study compare effect postoperative pain relief `` freezing '' ( ropivacaine 0.2 % ) alone combination clonidine nerve block child undergo hernia repair . The researcher anticipate addition clonidine `` freezing '' result prolongation postoperative pain relief child undergo hernia repair compare `` freezing '' use alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Addition Clonidine 0.2 % Ropivacaine Wound Instillation After Minor Lower Abdominal Surgery Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal method control postoperative pain child undergo hernia repair would effectively relieve pain extend period time adverse effect . Unfortunately , ideal technique exist . The control postoperative pediatric pain hernia repair achieve combination oral intravenous pain medication `` nerve block '' . `` Nerve block '' achieve inject local anesthetic commonly refer `` freeze `` next nerve supply wound . `` Freezing '' major nerve supply sensation site hernia repair child , asleep , effective . At CHEO , technique addition administer ketorolac , liquid intravenous form anti-inflammatory agent similar Advil , current technique choice postoperative pain control inguinal hernia . It unusual patient require extra pain medication postoperatively . Available mean pain control addition mention include codeine-like medication , Tylenol , Advil-like medication opioids administer intravenously . The addition medication increase risk suffer side effect include respiratory depression , nausea vomiting , itch . Ideally , prolongation postoperative pain relief addition second medication `` freezing '' nerve block would limit need additional pain medication hence , decrease associate side effect . Clonidine potential medication . It show provide pain relief affect several area nervous system include brain , spinal cord nerve . Clonidine prolongs pain relief certain local anesthetic use nerve block adult . Unfortunately , study examine combination clonidine local anesthetic ropivacaine nerve block child . Presently , injectable form clonidine market consider investigational Canada . The current study prospective double -blind , randomize , control trial . It compare effect postoperative pain relief `` freezing '' ( ropivacaine 0.2 % ) alone combination clonidine nerve block child undergo hernia repair . In addition , measure change child 's level sedation , breathing , heart rate , blood pressure complication . Finally , ass satisfy parent technique . The researcher anticipate addition clonidine `` freezing '' result prolongation postoperative pain relief child undergo hernia repair compare `` freezing '' use alone .</detailed_description>
