Issues memory problem , lack social support , medication side effect , depression , substance abuse significantly reduce patient adherence HAART . This study evaluate effectiveness manage problem solve strategy increase HAART adherence patient HIV . Both treatment-naive treatment-experienced participant recruit study .

Participants manage problem solve group 4 study visit receive 3 phone call first 3 month study , 1 phone call every month follow 9 month . At study visit , participant identify barrier adherence . During phone call , participant ask step take improve adherence . A medication event monitoring system ( MEMS ) use assess participant ' treatment adherence . MEMS use microelectronic monitor cap medication bottle record timing frequency bottle opening . Participants whose adherence decrease remained end 12 month evaluate regimen change . Blood collection begin end study use measure viral load CD4 count . Follow-up phone interview conduct every year 3 year end treatment . Study hypothesis : Managed problem solve result well adherence highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) good virologic control immunological outcome end 1 year compare control group receive standard care .</detailed_description>
