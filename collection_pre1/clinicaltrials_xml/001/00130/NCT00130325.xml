	<brief_summary>There new TB vaccine already develop need tried human assess efficacy . The researcher previously show production interferon gamma T cell response TB antigens specific marker TB infection . The researcher hypothesize use reliable early marker TB vaccine efficacy . The researcher expect show significantly increase reversion test household contact TB patient give Isoniazid prophylaxis treatment 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Isoniazid Reversion Interferon Gamma ELISPOT Tuberculosis ( TB ) Case Contacts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current effort control spread tuberculosis failing . An increasingly large number new generation vaccine produce plan assess ability prevent disease treat infection need develop . The MRC Labs The Gambia well position conduct safety immunogenicity study also conduct trial therapeutic effect vaccine prevent disease case contact infect . This study part one three-step plan develop reliable early surrogate marker therapeutic efficacy new TB vaccine . The three-step plan follow : - Evaluate ability isoniazid , know effective treatment MTB infection , revert antigen-specific IFNg-ELISPOT ESAT-6 and/or CFP-10 positive contact TB patient . - Compare ability different combination TB vaccine isoniazid revert ELISPOT 4-arm randomise trial using:1 ) isoniazid alone , 2 ) TB vaccine alone , 3 ) combination isoniazid TB vaccine , 4 ) placebo - Compare , randomize trial , ability TB vaccine vaccine plus isoniazid versus isoniazid alone prevent development secondary disease . For first step researcher test follow hypothesis : - Those receive isoniazid significantly high reversion rate MTB-specific response measure IFNg-ELISPOT assay compare receive placebo .</detailed_description>
