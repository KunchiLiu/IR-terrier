	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND INFORMATION At least one three people age sixty five report fall community year elderly figure nearer 40 % ( 1,2 ) . The morbidity mortality result fall elderly substantial cost associate fall likely rise predict growth elderly population . The Health Nation document recognise fall important cause disability use health service old people ( 3 ) . More 50 % accidental death age sixty five year due fall , survivor fall tow-fold increased chance hospitalise ( 4 ) . The target Health Nation reduce death rate accident among people age sixty five least 33 % year 2005 ( 3 ) . Prevention fall fall-related injury major factor achieve target . It therefore wise approach appropriate likely effective adequately research implement indicated . There number approach study prevention fall , sequela , elderly explore accompanying literature review . AIM To determine whether multidisciplinary assessment community-based patient , least one previous fall , reduce rate fall fall-related problem . The study also aim determine whether intervention , effective , best carry primary secondary care set . STUDY DESIGN A secondary prevention randomise control trial two different setting multidisciplinary intervention versus “ usual care ” . Randomisation do prior allocation cluster basis . This mean principal liaise General Practitioner practice sign consent volunteer “ cluster ” involvement study ( also set duty patient ) . The reason type randomisation avoid “ contamination ” usual care patient would likely General Practitioner receive regular information patient intervention arm trial . Assent study participation would also sought individual , without first know precise nature intervention ( 5 ) allow follow control group . Subjects recruit intervention group would receive information sheet outline study intervention would involve assent would seek . STUDY SIZE It think trial involve approximately 516 patient total . A recent local pilot study small fall related project identify 70 patient 9 month practice list 17,000 patient . It expect total population base patient identify 60,000 . It likely number require participate identify one year period . Power calculation indicate provide good chance achieve statistically significant result approximately 150 individual need three arm study . INTERVENTION There two intervention group . The first intervention group undergo multidisciplinary assessment physician , occupational therapist physiotherapist ( see enclose assessment form ) base fall clinic Royal Hampshire County Hospital ( RHCH ) . All patient full blood count , urea electrolyte , liver function test , thyroid function test , Vitamin D level , bone profile , electrocardiogram urinalysis . Further investigation , treatment modification onward referral make appropriate relevant individual . The patient ’ General Practitioner receive write communication regard visit , outcome recommendation . The second intervention group go Community-based process . All identified faller undergo assessment health worker participate practice . This individual , identify within practice , train assessment faller staff RHCH Falls Clinic , administer questionnaire , make referral physiotherapy , Occupational Therapy patient General Practitioner deem necessary . Individuals score particularly highly consider appropriate Primary Care team may still refer onward Hospital Falls Clinic . SUBJECTS Patients age 65 year age identify community least one fall precede month live one participate area . Subject identification opportunistic also ambulance service notify key worker practice patient fall home transfer elsewhere . A fall define “ inadvertently come rest ground low level without loss consciousness consequence sudden onset paralysis , epileptic seizure , excess alcohol intake overwhelming external force ( per Close et al ( 6 ) ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA - Abbreviated mental test score le 7 10 - Not live participate area - Planning move area within next year - Not expect survive follow period one year - Non-English speaker relative/carer could interpret METHODOLOGY Patients identify key worker participate General Practice Surgery . A baseline assessment do either patient ’ home local surgery key worker ( district nurse/practice nurse/health visitor ) . The assessment mostly questionnaire base seek information basic demographic data , living circumstance , Barthel score , abbreviate mental test score , circumstance recent ( index ) fall injury sustain , information regard previous fall last year , risk factor osteoporosis , 5 point Geriatric Depression Score , Elderly Falls Test Score score . A timed “ get go ” also do . All assessor train administration assessment reduce inter-assessor variability . The patient intervention group attend assessment Falls Clinic primary care set describe . Those conventional management group receive usual care primary care team . All subject send pay reply postcard monthly record fall fall injury . If return subject telephone ( possible ) . If fall record patient contact telephone detail . After one year baseline assessment repeat . Data analyse intention treat basis . PRIMARY ENDPOINT - Proportion participant group least one fall follow year SECONDARY ENDPOINTS - Death - Move institutional care - Change Barthel score - Change “ Get go ” score - Fall related admission follow-up period - Fall related fracture DISSEMINATION It intend trial subject peer review publication seek .
