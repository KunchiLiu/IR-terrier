	<brief_title>Molecular Genetic Study Schizophrenia : Parent-Offspring Trios</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Specific Aims We propose collect genomic DNA lymphoblast cell line total 150 family probands fulfil criterion DSM-IV schizophrenia three year . The first degree relative probands , include parent ( parent-offspring trio ) non-affected sibling , total 3 6 subject , also recruit study . Adequate statistical power molecular genetic study great concern . For concern , examine probands family member clinically use Diagnostic Interview Genetic Studies ( DIGS ) diagnostic assessment , use neuropsychological battery include sustain attention , executive function , verbal memory general intelligence . This specific aim project : ( 1 ) cooperate important Taiwan Genotyping Consortium propose NHRI ; ( 2 ) detect major schizophrenia susceptibility gene relate neuropsychological endophenotype ; ( 3 ) fine map suggestive linkage chromosome region replicate previous linkage study result use previously-collected co-affected sib-pair family sample ; ( 4 ) deposit lymphoblast cell line NHRI Cell Bank serve national resource basic research Taiwan . 2 . Background 1 . Genetic Basis Schizophrenia Most family study confirm schizophrenia relate disorder familial disorder risk first degree relative schizophrenic patient approximately ten time risk relative control . Twin study find concordance rate 46 % ~53 % MZ twin pair , 14 % ~15 % DZ twin pair ( Kendler KS 1983 ; Gottesman II 1993 ; Prescott Gottesman II , 1993 ) ; thus provide strong evidence hereditary component schizophrenia . However , concordance rate MZ twin far 100 % , also emphasize importance environmental factor etiology schizophrenia . The evidence genetic contribution etiology schizophrenia support adoption study . Adoption study schizophrenia show biological offspring schizophrenic mother raise adoptive parent , show high rate schizophrenia adult , compare control adoptee . Segregation analyse indicate multifactorial polygenic model , posit large , unspecified number loci combine additively cause schizophrenia , good fit observe pattern schizophrenia family study single major locus model . It suggest several gene small effect epistasis might responsible genetic etiology schizophrenia . The location susceptibility gene schizophrenia still active search use molecular genetic method . This way approach include linkage analysis , candidate gene association study , positional candidate gene approach , priori hypothesis would lead one focus give chromosomal region . Thus , whole genome need systemically screen . A genome-wide scan schizophrenia publish decade many chromosome region show suggestive evidence linkage , include chromosome 1q21-q22 , 1q31-q42 , 2p22-q21 , 4q24-q32 , 6p24-p22 , 6q16-q23 , 8p24-p21 , 10p14-p13 , 13q14-q32 , 15q13-q14 , 22q11-q13 . However , chromosome region ever report genome-wide significant linkage evidence , include chromosome 1q21-q22 , 6p24-p22 , 8p21 13q32 . Candidate gene study reveal inconsistent result past decade . Neurotransmitter related gene , dopamine ( D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , D5 ) , serotonin , r-aminobutyric acid Glutamate receptor gene study use association linkage study consistent result obtain . Neuron growth relate gene , phospholipase gene , potassium channel gene ( hKCa3/KCNN3 ) report association schizophrenia . The hypothesis pathophysiological mechanism schizophrenia provide probable candidate gene approach molecular genetic study . There exist two issue resolve candidate gene approach use case-control design . Firstly , critical issue assess significance association phenotypic measure likelihood type I errors . Since many gene phenotype evaluate schizophrenia , significance level need adjust due low prior probability multiple testing . Secondly , effect different population admixture case control may inflate type I errors Positional candidate gene approach use linkage dysequilibrium strategy may resolve two problem raise approach candidate gene association study base upon previous linkage result increase prior probability use parent-offspring trio internal control . This approach powerful linkage study locate susceptibility gene complex disorder schizophrenia . With fine mapping linkage evidence , whole genome sequence single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) map , advance microarray technique available , approach efficient locate susceptibility gene schizophrenia . Recently , study use strategy report significant linkage dysequilibrium evidence schizophrenia microsatellite polymorphism SNP gene , NOTCH4 gene , chromosome 6p21 . Considering potential positional candidate gene approach use linkage dysequilibrium strategy , propose collect parent-offspring trio schizophrenia sample molecular genetic study schizophrenia . With previous ongoing effort linkage study schizophrenia use co-affected sib-pairs schizophrenia ( see preliminary result ) , sample use positional candidate gene study . 3 . Neuropsychological Deficit Schizophrenia In domain neuropsychology , schizophrenia show unique pattern impairment central executive function , sustain attention work memory rather unique schizophrenia suggestive frontostriatal dysfunction . It agree researcher neuropsychological impairment schizophrenia best demonstrate comprehensive test battery tap various neuropsychological process , rather single , isolated test present , impairment strongly suggest dysfunction frontal-temporal-limbic circuit . Among neuropsychological deficit schizophrenia , visual sustain attention measure Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ) executive function measure Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( WCST ) study thoroughly . Common feature CPT participant must respond predesignated target among stimulus present rapid fixed rate . The discrimination vigilance task CPT may consist single stimulus ( CPT-X , single character number target ) two successive stimulus ( CPT-AX , character number precede another character number target ) . The difficulty level CPT raise blur stimulus ( degraded CPT ) use relative target ( CPT-Identical Pairs Version CPT-IP ) . The different CPT version might tap different component sustain attention : difficult one stable vulnerability indicator , simpler one might mediate vulnerability indicator schizophrenia . Among study specifically examine relationship CPT performance index clinical symptom dimension , one consistent finding CPT deficit associate negative symptom . Many study also find poor performance CPT associate thought disorder disorganize symptom . Executive function deficit measure WCST refer abnormal function prefrontal cortex . Deficits WCST performance endure core feature schizophrenia , predict long term disability , independent cognitive deficit . Functional neuroimaging study find WCST activate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dopamimetic drug improve performance task patient schizophrenia enhance signal noise prefrontal physiological response . Previous study confirm deficit sustain attention executive function specific schizophrenia relate schizophrenic pathophysiological process . The deficit also associate genetic risk schizophrenia may serve endophenotype genetic analysis schizophrenia . 4 . Endophenotype Approach Molecular Genetic Studies Schizophrenia To resolve problem insufficient power genetic analysis genetic heterogeneity schizophrenia , alternative strategy advocate use specific neurobiological characteristic illness additional phenotype might reflect closely effect single genetic alteration . The visual sustained attention deficit measure CPT potential endophenotype genetic susceptibility schizophrenia . CPT deficits present schizophrenia patient , also non-psychotic relative . Using data 148 non-psychotic relative 345 community adult find recurrence risk ratio Î»was great 15 undegraded CPT great 30 degrade CPT . The executive function deficit measure WCST may also serve endophenotype genetic study schizophrenia . WCST deficit present schizophrenic patient healthy sibling . Thus , use CPT deficit WCST deficit endophenotypes schizophrenia would provide valuable measure genetic risk , would improve power genetic analysis may help identify susceptibility gene schizophrenia . This endophenotype strategy successful mapping neurophysiological deficit schizophrenia , decrease P50 inhibition , loci chromosome 15q13-14 , recently . The genome-wide linkage analysis P50 inhibition deficit nine multiplex schizophrenia family find significant lod score ( Z = 5.30 , ï± = 0 ) loci chromosome 15q14 . When clinical diagnosis schizophrenia use affected phenotype , maximum lod score marker statistically significant . The neurobiological deficit , eye track dysfunction schizophrenia map chromosome 6p23-21 maximum multipoint lod score 4.02 . Again , clinical diagnosis schizophrenia use affected phenotype , linkage result non-significant . In summary , preliminary study linkage analysis use co-affected sib-pairs schizophrenia neuropsychological deficit schizophrenia , project collect schizophrenic parent-offspring trio well-defined neuropsychological endophenotypes , consider one crucial project search susceptibility gene schizophrenia . 3 . Preliminary Studies 1 . Collection Schizophrenia Co-affected Sibpairs Family The P.I . commit collect schizophrenia co-affected sib-pairs family since 1990 . With awareness importance critical necessity diagnostic assessment , probands , co-affected sib available non-affected sib well parent assess semi-structured psychiatrist diagnostic interview use diagnostic criterion DSM-III-R and/or DSM-IV . Besides , evolutionary theoretical model psychopathology , developmental data also collect . All clinical data family-tree data establish data bank molecular genetic laboratory ( DBMGL ) Department Psychiatry , College Medicine , National Taiwan University auspice P.I . In total , around 120 schizophrenia co-affected sib-pairs family available linkage analysis DBMGL . As rule , DNA sample obtain peripheral white cell available subject family , especially co-affected sib , least one non-affected sib parent . In total , around 1000 DNA sample DBMGL . Cell-lines EBV-958 transform lymphoblast cell establish . All study subject well inform study inform consent obtain . All family participate study invite join `` New-Hope Family Club '' periodic meeting discussion . Around 150 schizophrenia case receive detail clinical assessment regular follow-up comprehensive neuropsychological assessment , include CPT , WCST , WAIS-R , WMS , recruit obtain DNA sample . Around 200 normal control subject also recruit obtain DNA sample . The instrument use genetic study establish . The Diagnostic Interview Schedule Genetic Study ( DIGS ) schizotypy interview schedule ( SIS ) translate modify useful Taiwan subject . The Perceptual aberration scale ( PAS ) Schizotypal personality questionnaire ( SPQ ) also use community study schizophrenia-related personality disorder . The cross-cultural consideration employ . A 5-year nation-wide collaborative work Taiwan ( Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study , TSLS ) , sponsor NIMH , U.S.A. , collect family co-affected sib-pairs schizophrenia go third year . A total 600 family collect . DNA sample , cell-lines clinical data DIGS , FIGS , well neuropsychological test data collect . The DNA sample would open research teams world . 2 . Molecular Genetic Studies Schizophrenia Our molecular genetic study schizophrenia support three consecutive project : molecular genetic project sponsor National Science Council ( 1989-1992 ) , molecular genetic project MPGRP ( 1993-1998 ) molecular genetic project MPSS ( 1998-2001 ) sponsor NHRI . The early phase ( 1989-1992 ) molecular genetic project focus establish laboratory facility collect co-affected schizophrenic sib-pair family . The 2nd phase molecular genetic project ( 1993-1998 ) continue collection family , collection extend collect co-affected bipolar sib-pairs , schizophrenic case normal control . We find polymorphism androgen receptor gene ( CAG ) n probable association schizophrenia . This finding support find DeLisi et al . The molecular genetic method linkage analysis candidate gene association promote , laboratory P.I . ( Dr. Hwu ) move emphasize area . The result laboratory : ( 1 ) The polymorphism ( 48bp ) repeat DRD4 receptor gene significantly link schizophrenia ; ( 2 ) A single mutation DRD2 find associate schizophrenia ( 3 ) The sample data bank project join three international collaboration study use positional cloning approach need relatively large sample . The one organize Gill et al entitle `` Schizophrenia Collaborative Linkage Group '' , another lead Dr. Moises Kiel University , Germany third one Dr. Powell London . All result reveal possible marker chromosome 6p , 11q , 13q , 19q 22q . This suggest Taiwanese patient may possible susceptibility gene region , except chromosome 13q , fit oligogenetic model . ( 4 ) The association study 5-HT2 receptor gene locate chromosome 13q find negative ; ( 5 ) Clinical epidemiological analysis use co-affected sib-pairs demonstrate tendency 3 independent symptom cluster reality disorganization , disorganization negative state . ( 6 ) Weak linkage evidence loci chromosome 6p24-22 . The 3rd phase molecular genetic study ( 1998-2001 ) continue focus collect co-affected schizophrenic sib-pair family linkage analysis report suggestive evidence chromosome region , include chromosome 1q21-q22 , 1q31-q42 , 8p24-p21 , 15q13-q14 , 22q11-q14 . The linkage result ( 1 ) suggestive evidence linkage schizophrenia without negative symptom chromosome 6p24 22q12 ( 2 ) linkage evidence GABAA receptor Î±1 ( GABRA1 ) , Î²1 ( GABRB1 ) andÎ²3 ( GABAB3 ) subunit gene schizophrenia ( 3 ) linkage evidence Glutamate GluR5 GluR6 receptor gene schizophrenia ( 4 ) linkage evidence SCA1 gene schizophrenia ( 5 ) suggestive linkage evidence marker chromosome 8p schizophrenia ( Hwu et al. , 2001a ) ( 6 ) weak linkage evidence marker chromosome 1q31-42 schizophrenia ( 7 ) suggestive linkage evidence marker 15q13-14 schizophrenia ( 8 ) modest linkage evidence schizophrenia loci chromosome 1q21-22 . The candidate gene approach reveal following result : ( 1 ) possible association Dopamine D4 receptor ( DRD4 ) gene polymorphism quick treatment response schizophrenia ( Liu et al. , 2001d ) . ( 2 ) association cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( c-PLA2 ) gene polymorphism schizophrenia . 3 . Studies Neuropsychological Deficits Schizophrenia We find impaired sustained attention continuous performance test ( CPT ) trait marker schizophrenia . Family study indicate sustained attention deficit measure CPT vulnerability marker schizophrenia . The result : ( 1 ) substantial proportion non-psychotic relative schizophrenia probands ( 19-34 % ) CPT deficit , predict probands â CPT performance ; ( 2 ) subject schizotypal personality feature also exhibit CPT deficit , specifically associate negative factor schizotypy ; ( 3 ) CPT deficits present schizophrenic patient , particularly associate negative disorganize symptom , difficult CPT version amenable neuroleptic treatment . The specificity CPT study group schizophrenia patient ( n=41 ) contrast group bipolar patient psychotic symptom ( n=46 ) group bipolar patient without psychotic symptom ( n=22 ) group patient non-psychotic major depressive disorder ( n=22 ) . It find CPT deficit stable vulnerable indicator schizophrenia , mediate vulnerability indicator bipolar disorder , state-dependent indicator major depression . These result demonstrate CPT deficit valid trait marker schizophrenia . All preliminary data support PI associate capable execute project include collection parent-offspring trios family , DNA extraction cell culture laboratory technique , neuropsychological assessment . 4 . Research Design Methods 1 . Subjects We prepare collect parent-offspring trio family Medical Center National Taiwan University Hospital affiliate psychiatric hospital , Taoyuan Psychiatric Center . The proband case recruit resident Northern part Taiwan . Informed consent obtain recruitment study . The first degree relative recruit parent least one unaffected sibling . The diagnosis proband case schizophrenia define DSM-IV criterion . 1 . Clinical Assessment Measures I . The Diagnostic Interview Genetic Studies ( DIGS ) All subject personally interviewed DIGS , create Tsuang Faraone NIMH Human Genetics Initiative . The DIGS make detailed assessment course illness , make careful assessment substance abuse mood symptom . This allow easy differential diagnosis schizophrenia substance related psychosis , schizoaffective disorder psychotic mood disorder . This detailed assessment help protect false positive diagnosis . In addition , DIGS provide rich description many domain psychopathology : somatization , major depression , mania/hypomania , dysthymia/depressive personality/hyperthymic personality , alcohol abuse disorder , pathological gambling , antisocial personality disorder . It also collect self-reported demographic medical history data . Ratings also make Global Assessment Scale Scales Assessment Positive Negative Symptoms . Schizotypal Axis II Cluster A personality feature assess use modify version Structured Interview Schizotypy . II . The Family Interview Genetic Studies ( FIGS ) As additional source pedigree information , FIGS conduct member family . This interview systematically question informant presence psychiatric illness relative . We administer FIGS three step . First , structure family pedigree drawn review informant . Next , psychiatric screen question ask relative pedigree . Then base response screen question , one five symptom checklist ( depression , mania , substance abuse , psychosis , paranoid /schizoid/ schizotypal personality disorder ) complete first-degree relative , spouse , relative well know informant . The DIGS FIGS translate Chinese . The reliability validity establish preliminary study . III . The Diagnostic Procedure All diagnose make use DSM-IV . These diagnosis make two board certify psychiatrist clinical research experience diagnosis psychotic patient . Final diagnosis probands relative base content interview , case vignette , information provide relative complete review medical record diagnostician . If two diagnostician disagree patient 's diagnosis , third diagnostician use tie-breaker . IV . Training Interviewers The training program certify interviewer : ( 1 ) establish work knowledge diagnostic system use DIGS FIGS ; ( 2 ) develop expertise administration score structure diagnostic instrument ; ( 3 ) fully understand process inform consent need strict adherence consent procedure . The training program divide two stage : ( 1 ) formal didactic training ( 2 ) supervise experience use structure diagnostic interview . The didactic training begin trainee read familiarize diagnostic system use DIGS . This initial exposure supplement lecture review diagnostic criterion psychiatric disorder cover interview . Central issue address lecture : ( 1 ) importance establish diagnosis basis objective behavioral description ; ( 2 ) careful delineation differentiation syndrome involve psychotic affective phenomenon ; ( 3 ) clarification major difference syndrome definition among diagnostic system . The second component training focus structure diagnostic instrument . Trainees first gain familiarity structure interview . This facilitated trainee conduct practice interview alternately play role interviewer subject . These initial interview conduct senior psychiatrist attendance identify problem area administration ensure clinically sensitive use interview . The training program also include module modify Structured Interview Schizotypy ( SIS ) . The SIS training include review literature schizotypal personality disorder , orientation review instrument , opportunity trainee observe make clinical rating live interview , review discussion clinical rating clarify score criterion . All training course well establish preliminary study . 2 . Neuropsychological Evaluations Considering complexity propose neuropsychological deficit schizophrenia , test battery tap multiple aspect cerebral process choose explore patient ' overall pattern neuropsychological deficit . The battery consist test suppose measure : 1 . Sustained attention ( Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ) , undegraded degraded test situation ) 2 . Central executive function ( Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( WCST ) ; Trail-making B ) ; 3 . Memory function ( Weschler Memory Scale-third edition , WMS-III ) . 4 . Test general intellectual achievement ( block design ; picture completion ; information ; similarity ; arithmetic ; digit span ; digit symbol substitution ) . The neuropsychological test use present study validity test battery well establish preliminary study . We prepare administer neuropsychological test battery probands recruit family member possible . The neuropsychological test battery rather time-consuming , estimate take 3 4 hour complete . Hence , neuropsychological test battery administrate divided session , complete two day . Two master degree research assistant major psychology perform test . 2 . Laboratory Work : This project two line laboratory work 1 . Collection blood sample extraction DNA Twenty thirty ml venous blood obtain study subject purple top green top vacutainer tube . The blood sample purple top tube use DNA extraction . We prepare extract DNA use modify salting-out method . 2 . Cell-line set-up All blood sample newly collect lymphocyte transform lymphoblastic cell preservation cell-line deposit cell bank NHRI proposal request . The detail procedure cell culture establish molecular genetic laboratory list attached file molecular genetic study . 3 . Data Management We already set computerized DIGS database software previous study ( Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study , TSLS ) neuropsychological databank another previous study ( Multidimensional Psychopathological Study Schizophrenia , MPSS ) . All clinical neuropsychological data project incorporate databanks . The family pedigree data , DNA data , cell culture data incorporate previously establish databank : Bank Molecular Genetic Laboratory Data ( BMGLD ) . This BMGLD include 4 set Data : ( 1 ) family tree genotyping data bank . These data set-up use cyrillic program ; ( 2 ) DNA sample bank ; ( 3 ) clinical data endophenotype bank ( 4 ) cell-line bank . This well organize BMGLD great value continous research work . The data entry procedure follow guideline use ongoing project . These procedure seek maximize accuracy data . The data double-entered , original verification file compare discrepancy . All datasets back disc regularly . The backup original data set maintain different locked office . The datasets project available investigator follow guideline RFA . We create dataset include data require RFA whatever additional data NHRI desire incorporate Cell Bank . These data send data management center designate NHRI subsequent distribution member genotyping consortium . 5 .
