	<detailed_description>Incidence Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer first mortality rate gynecologic malignancy overall 5-year survival rate 20-30 % . It become important disease recent year incidence ovarian cancer also increase recent year Taiwan . The lack symptom , difficulty early diagnosis , insufficient accurate tumor marker , lack information ovarian tumor biology contribute poor prognosis ovarian cancer patient . The prognostic parameter ovarian carcinomas tumor stage , histologic subtype , degree malignancy , residual tumor surgical treatment . However , factor present incomplete picture tumor biology ovarian cancer frequently interrelate . Thus , identification new biologic factor predictive individual disease course prognosis would extremely useful . From above-mentioned data , ovarian cancer indeed disease respect , however , little research work focus Taiwan . Treatment ovarian cancer Epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) extraovarian Müllerian carcinoma similar pathologic entity share preference peritoneal cavity involvement . The spread pattern tumor present challenge unique opportunity immunotherapy . Patients EOC stage I disease ( localized ovary ) optimal surgical staging , 5-year survival rate 90 % , significant change 10 year . In contrast , patient spread beyond ovary median survival rate decrease &lt; 10 % patient bulky residual disease surgery treatment platinum-based combination chemotherapy . A randomized trial first-line chemotherapy patient EOC residual mass large 1 cm initial surgery , show median survival period 38 month cisplatin/paclitaxel , significantly great 24 month cisplatin/cytoxan treatment arm . In interim analysis equivalency trial , survival carboplatin/paclitaxel bad cisplatin/paclitaxel . Even though early diagnosis important goal ongoing clinical research effort , unclear whether advanced EOC start multicentric process involve ovary peritoneal surface . It establish hereditary factor contribute development EOC . Germline BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation account approximately 10 % EOC . In woman BRCA 1 2 mutation , lifetime risk ovarian cancer range 16 % -44 % . With commercial availability genetic test BRCA1 BRCA2 , woman identify high risk ovarian cancer . There clear guideline cancer prevention individual . Although prophylactic oophorectomy reasonable option woman complete childbearing , woman still risk develop peritoneal cancer . Clearly , option prevention need . Immunotherapy ovarian cancer In develop effective immune-based strategy EOC , distinction preventative therapeutic approach . It anticipated immunoprevention ( immunoprophylaxis ) develop woman increase risk development EOC . In contrast , immunotherapy would use adjuvant surgery combination chemotherapy biologics chemoimmunotherapy biochemoimmunotherapy . Patients undetectable disease restaged chemotherapy could consider immunotherapy presumption majority fact micrometastases . Development effective immune-based concept prevention treatment EOC require understand tumor-immunology principle , mechanisms action expand array immune modulating molecule , identification characterization tumor antigen , determination microenvironment factor could impact different immune-effector mechanism . The clinical researcher provide many immune direct agent , progress integration standard therapy somewhat slow . Folate receptor The folate receptor ( FR ) , 38 kDa membrane glycoprotein , represent homologous family glycoprotein , two ( FR-a FR-b ) attach cell surface glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor ; third isoform ( FR- ) truncate version ( FR-9 ) constitutively secrete lack efficient signal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol modification . FR-a express normal epithelial cell elevate certain carcinoma , whereas FR-b myeloid differentiation marker elevate nonepithelial malignancy . FR-9 express hematopoietic tissue . At present , FR major focus tumor target multiple experimental approach cancer therapy . One novel approach use bifunctional antibody target T cell FR surface ovarian carcinoma cell . Selective growth inhibition tumor cell obtain approach . The chimeric antibody , bind FR either CD3 CD28 , produce impressive result xenogeneic model patient advanced ovarian cancer . Similarly , chimeric molecule consist single-chain , Fv anti-FR antibody interleukin 2 effective inhibit tumor growth vivo . Alternatively , folic acid conjugate single chain anti-T-cell receptor antibody could mobilize T-cell response FR-rich tumor . Taking advantage nondestructive nature FR-mediated internalization folate-coupled macromolecule , cytotoxin momordin , Pseudomonas exotoxin , maytansinoids show produce selective kill FR-rich cell . Furthermore , toxicity conjugate dependent upon receptor density cell surface . Folate-conjugated radiopharmaceutical also appear offer mean tumor imaging/radiation therapy . Folate-coated liposome show selectively target FR-rich tumor cell , selective kill malignant cell obtain encapsulate doxorubicin liposome . By similar strategy , possible deliver antisense oligonucleotides epidermal growth factor receptor FR-rich tumor cell . Furthermore , selective target adenoviral vector FR-rich tumor cell achieve presence antibody ablate endogenous viral tropism . Finally , several study show FR , express high level , could offer preferred uptake route novel class antifolate drug target glycineamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase thymidylate synthase . A soluble form FR detect serum ascites patient ovarian cancer . The FR report selectively overexpressed 90 % non-mucinous ovarian carcinoma malignant tissue . The receptor detect normal cell type , normal ovarian surface epithelium . It seem FR could potential target antigen immunotherapy ovarian cancer . Epitopes folate receptor human haplotype The incidence HLA-A2 haplotype 50 % Western country . The incidence HLA-A2 haplotype around 30 % Taiwan . The specific epitope folate receptor HLA-A2 haplotype identify . They E39 ( FR , 191-199 ) EIWTHSTKV E75 ( FR , 245-253 ) LLSLALMLL , respectively . It seem folate receptor could target antigen immunotherapy ovarian cancer . Our research team focus development cancer vaccine immunotherapy several year . Our laboratory facility also set evaluate human immunologic assay human papilloma virus type 16 E7 antigen grant support National Taiwan University Hospital . It important set various folate receptor-specific immunologic assay human being evaluate effect cancer vaccine immunotherapy ovarian cancer future clinical trial . So would like provide proposal address development folate receptor-specific immunologic assay human being . There several aim project : 1. develop utilize assay measure CTLs folate receptor , 2. evaluate folate receptor-specific immunologic response normal control ovarian cancer patient .</detailed_description>
