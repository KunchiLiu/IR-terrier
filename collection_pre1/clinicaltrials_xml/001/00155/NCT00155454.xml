	<brief_summary>Recurrent vitreous hemorrhage vitrectomy complication diabetic retinopathy common occurrence . The hemorrhage may appear within first week surgery month later . This complication may delay visual rehabilitation significantly sometimes require additional procedure surgery , jeopardize previous successful operation . The cause bleed diverse . While evidence suggest fibrovascular proliferation sclerotomy sit vitreous base may important source recurrent vitreous hemorrhage , origins hemorrhage exist include lysed clot residual vitreous skirt , injured retinal vessel surgery , incompletely remove fibrovascular tissue . The latter three condition may major source early postoperative vitreous hemorrhage . We show peripheral retinal cryotherapy along cryo treatment sclerotomy site may effectively reduce incidence fibrovascular proliferation inner surface sclerotomy sit prevent late-onset recurrent vitreous hemorrhage . However , many patient still experience disturb vitreous hemorrhage within first two three week post-operative transient clear-up vitreous . We hypothesize gas bubble within vitreous cavity may mechanically temponade fragile retinal vessel , concentrate coagulation factor vitreous cavity , allow integrity vessel wall gradually recovers thus prevent occurrence early postoperative recurrent vitreous hemorrhage . To test hypothesis , clinical study undertaken investigate effect long-acting gas infuse vitreous cavity end diabetic vitrectomy prevention recurrent vitreous hemorrhage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist two part . Part one prospective clinical observational study ; part two case control study . From January 2005 May 2005 , consecutive patient undergo primary par plana vitrectomy complication proliferative diabetic retinopathy recruit prospective study . The selection criterion : 1 ) anticoagulant therapy use prior surgery post-operative follow-up period ; 2 ) ther medical history blood disease associate abnormal blood coagulation . During operation , removal fibrovascular tissue well old fresh blood attempt completely could safely do case ; blood clot adherent peripheral vitreous skirt remove much possible ; peripheral retinal cryotherapy ( 10 12 spot one row ) , sclerotomy site cryo ( 2 spot , 6 second , 3 sclerotomy site ) perform . For case without retinal detachment break , fluid-gas exchange 7.5 % C3F8 do end surgery ; For preexist break iatrogenic break induce retinal detachment , fluid-gas exchange 15 % C3F8 perform cryotherapy . After surgery , patient without break keep prone position overnight , maintain head wake hour lie either side , sleep 3 week . Other patient assume head position depend location break . Ophthalmological examination perform first 4 day surgery , weekly 6 week monthly 4 month . The preoperative , intraoperative postoperative data collect patient . These included age , gender , study eye , type duration diabetes mellitus , intraoperative diagnosis , use scleral buckle , silicone oil temponade ; data regard time , duration , frequency treatment recurrent vitreous hemorrhage duration post-operation follow-up also compile . Results ophthalmological examination , include best correct visual acuity , intraocular pressure , corneal condition , anterior chamber reaction , lens status , intravitreal gas amount , retina condition record . The amount vitreous blood assess indirect ophthalmoscopy patient sit face-up position . The degree vitreous opacity record accord criterion set grade vitreous opacity uveitis . Patients silicone oil infusion , fail achieve retinal attachment least 3 month , follow less minimum 5-month exclude study . Using inclusion exclusion criterion , chart review September 2004 May 2005 diabetic case operate surgeon cryo treatment without long-acting gas infusion end vitrectomy do . Similar data prospective study ( except intravitreal gas amount ) collect . These case serve control compare rate recurrent vitreous hemorrhage change best-corrected visual acuity case intravitreal long-acting gas without .</detailed_description>
