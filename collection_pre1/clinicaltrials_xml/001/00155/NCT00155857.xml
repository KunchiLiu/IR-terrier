	<detailed_description>Glaucoma long recognise leading cause blindness , scale problem increase future population growth increase life expectancy ( 1 ) . The epidemiological information available 1993 World Health Organization 's ( WHO ) global data bank blindness review Thylefors Négrel ( 1 ) . They develop simple model estimate number glaucoma blind people World Bank region . Primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) judge responsible three million blind , primary angle closure glaucoma ( PACG ) two million , congenital glaucoma figure 200 000 , give total 5.2 million blind . This represent 15 % global blindness . The number people affect glaucoma estimate 20 million . In 1996 , Quigley use 111 publish report glaucoma prevalence construct statistical model number people affect glaucoma worldwide ( 2 ) . Data include study design , method , report result meet certain specific criterion . The country world arrange seven group accord similarity ethnicity presume characteristic glaucoma . For region , available age specific prevalence OAG ACG apply population projection year 2000 . It estimate 66.8 million people affected OAG ACG , nearly equal number people affect disease . Few prevalence study describe secondary glaucoma separately , estimate six million secondary glaucoma reach , make total , without childhood glaucoma , around 73 million affected . Of , 6.7 million thought blind ( 2 ) . There reliable epidemiologic evidence suggest PACG common among Eskimos ( 3 ) Chinese ( 4 ) . As POAG common western country , large population risk Asia ( 5 ) . PACG among Asians frequently chronic symptom ( 6 ) . Therefore , person might motivate symptom present medical attention significant visual damage occur region . A population-based study screen technique PACG perform township Jin Shan rural Taiwan ( 7 ) . This joint US-Taiwanese project , publish 1996 , identify target population 5441 people age 40 year old , 562 examine . A gonioscopic examination carry subject . PACG diagnose people `` narrow '' angle either IOP &gt; 18 mm Hg , increase IOP 8 mm Hg dark prone provocation test , previous `` acute '' episode angle closure iridectomy . The diagnosis depend presence visual field defect structural optic neuropathy . There 17 people diagnose suffer PACG ( 3.0 % ) . Only 35 % case give history symptom characteristic `` acute '' angle closure . Two 17 people ( 12 % ) blind eye ( 7 ) . As aforementioned , Taiwan high prevalence PACG , usually lead blindness ultimately . There many report study gene POAG normal-tension glaucoma Asia , include Japan ( 14,21,29 ) , China ( 25 ) , Korea ( 24 ) . However , study genetics PACG lacking . Hence , study , use model genomewide microsatellite genotyping method linkage disequilibrium study possible candidate gene PACG . Then , sequence cDNA forPAX6 find possible mutation family well-defined pedigree .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>An occludable angle define one less 90° circumference pigment trabecular meshwork visible . Persons primary angleclosure suspect ( PACS ) occludable angle abnormality . Primary angle closure ( PAC ) diagnose person normal visual field optic disc occludable angle evidence angle dysfunction . Dysfunctional feature include elevated IOP ( &gt; 19 mm Hg ) positive darkroom–prone provocation test , peripheral anterior synechiae , pigment smear superior drainage angle , sequelae acute angle closure ( iris whorling glaukomflecken ) , clear history symptomatic angle closure evidence peripheral iridectomy . An IOP 19 mm Hg chosen take mean +2 SDs data SinoMongoloid people . Primary angleclosure glaucoma diagnose subject occludable drainage angle glaucomatous optic neuropathy compatible visual morbidity . Optic neuropathy define CDR 0.7 , asymmetry 0.2 . In early moderate case ( CDR 0.7 0.8 asymmetry 0.2 ) , reproducible visual field defect require confirm diagnosis . In advanced case ( CDR &gt; =0.9 CDR asymmetry &gt; 0.3 ) , perimetric evidence visual loss absolute requirement . Primary angleclosure glaucoma diagnose disc visible , iris stromal atrophy whorling see conjunction visual acuity less 20/400 . Individuals exclude know ocular disease insult could predispose myopia , retinopathy prematurity earlyage medium opacification , know genetic disease associate myopia , Stickler Marfan syndrome .</criteria>
