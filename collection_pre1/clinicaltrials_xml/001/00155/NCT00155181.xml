	<brief_summary>EBV , infection process , immortalization , B lymphocytes , Epithelial cell , co-culture Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) belong human γ-herpes virus . Unlike human herpes virus , EBV predominately infect two type human cell : lymphoid cell epithelial cell infection associate several human malignancy two cell type . The lymphoid cancer associate EBV infection include Burkitt ’ lymphoma , Hodgkin ’ disease , B lymphoma immunodeficient patient T/NK cell lymphoma . The carcinoma associate EBV nasopharyngeal carcinoma gastric carcinoma . One unique biological feature EBV infect immortalize primary B lymphocytes vitro lymphoblastoid cell line ( LCL ) . So far , limited information know whole EBV infection process regulation mechanism immortalization . In project , three EBV infection model set reveal cellular event signal transduction pathway possibly involve EBV infection process immortalization course action .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Mechanism Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) , human malignancy derive nasopharyngeal epithelial cell , occur highly frequently Taiwan . Of note , average age NPC individual usually ten year young patient head neck cancer . Clinically , early onset high incidence metastasis NPC may contribute poor prognosis . Fortunately , NPC usually radio-and chemo-therapy sensitive early stage . So , understand NPC pathogenesis , efficient detection method would develop NPC early diagnosis prognosis . Four unique characteristic report NPC : geographic preference , heavy infiltration lymphocyte , high incidence metastasis association Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . According hypothesis cellular change viral factor crucial NPC development , four major long-term study goal carry lab : ( 1 ) identification characterization cellular viral factor involve NPC formation , ( 2 ) elucidation potency molecules clinical diagnosis prognosis marker NPC , ( 3 ) investigation molecular biological linkage EBV infection NPC development ( 4 ) establishment drug-screening system NPC chemotherapy . Based assumption cellular gene viral factor involve NPC carcinogenesis , follow gene choose major study target five-year grant . Firstly , asses alteration cellular gene expression , choose three cytokine gene 【interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-7 IL-13】 , three inhibitor apoptosis protein ( IAP ) gene ( survivin , HIAP-1 , HIAP-2 ) , two specific cellular gene ( osteoblast-specific factor-2 polymeric immunoglobulin receptor ) one tumor suppressor gene ( tumor susceptibility gene TSG101 ) proposal . All gene exhibit special expression profile NPC biopsy preliminary study . So , regulation effect gene epithelial cell would study focus . Secondly , two EBV viral gene , Zta LMP2A , former encode immediately early lytic product later encode latent membrane protein , select study . In previous grant , find Zta up-regulate TKT ( trk-related tyrosine kinase ) matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) -1 down-stream effector TKT . Therefore extend study Zta LMP2A regulate influence anti-apoptotic network metastasis progression . Based preliminary data , proposal highly approachable result may provide valuable information NPC diagnosis , prognosis treatment .</detailed_description>
