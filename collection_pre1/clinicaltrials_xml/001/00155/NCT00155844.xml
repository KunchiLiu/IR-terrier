	<detailed_description>Bone marrow consist complex hematopoietic cellular component continuously go self-replication and/or differentiation process . When blood progenitor cell differentiate mature cell , exit unassisted peripheral blood . On hand , immature cell trap marrow-blood barrier . However , malignant transformation hematopoietic progenitor cell AML CML result blockade ability terminally differentiate , cause rapid accumulation immature cells.Chemokines show direct movement cell intravascular extravascular compartments.The CXC chemokine CXCL12 , ligand CXCR4 , activate distinct signal pathway may mediate cell migration . Recent report demonstrate migration HPC transplantation PB BM via concentration gradient create CXCL12 , produce marrow stromal cell , propose integral home process . The mirror image home mobilization HPC BM PB , clinical setting induce administration various stimulus include hematopoietic growth factor . The CXCR4-CXCL12 axis report important retaining immature cell appropriate bone marrow compartment . In preliminary research , analyze CXCR4 expression chemotactic response CXCL12 peripheral plasma six leukemia cell line ( HL-60 , HL-CZ , K562 , U937 , Raji Jurkat ) flow cytometry two-chamber migration assay , respectively . Three category among could suggest : one CXCR4 ( - ) CXCL12 response ( - ) , HL-CZ K562 cell ; CXCR4 ( + ) CXCL12 response ( - ) , HL-60 Raji cell ; rest CXCR4 ( + ) CXCL12 response ( + ) , Jurkat U937 cell . These result make u wonder leukemic cell could egress PB BM due destruction home process activation mobilization process CXCR4-CXCL12 axis dysfunction . Therefore , focus evaluate mechanism CXCR4-CXCL12 axis dysfunction various leukemic cell line primary leukemic cell several aspect : 1 ) . Evaluate CXCR4 expression CXCL12 response leukemic cell patient acute leukemia ; 2 ) . Study molecular mechanism blockade CXCR4-CXCL12 signal CXCR4 ( + ) SDF response ( - ) cell ; 3 ) . Evaluate marrow plasma peripheral plasma find plasma factor interfere migration behavior leukemic CXCR4 ( + ) CXCL12 response ( - ) cell</detailed_description>
