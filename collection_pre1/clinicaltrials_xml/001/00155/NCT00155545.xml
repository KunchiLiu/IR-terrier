	<brief_summary>The purpose study use motion analysis technique study biomechanical interaction spine low limbs scoliosis patient without leg length discrepancy ( LLD ) activity ; investigate effect correction LLD : use foot orthosis functional scoliotic spinal curve motion functional activity ; test whether idiopathic scoliosis without LLD improve artificially create leg length discrepancy foot orthosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Scoliosis one common back deformities child . Idiopathic functional ( secondary ) scoliosis arguably two common type . The etiology idiopathic scoliosis study many aspect genetic factor , skeletal muscle abnormality , neurological mechanism , biomechanical factor , common cause secondary functional scoliosis leg length inequality muscle spasm . It evident biomechanical factor involve interaction musculoskeletal alignment load closely associate development type scoliosis . Leg length discrepancy ( LLD ) define condition pair limbs unequal length . It generally accept LLD lead lumbar scoliosis assume scoliosis cause LLD remove LLD eliminate . However , study document effect correction LLD functional scoliotic spinal curve motion functional activity . Since spinal curve motion clear association leg length inequality , one would wonder whether idiopathic scoliosis without LLD improve artificially create leg length difference orthosis spine surgery consider less severe condition . It show LLD scoliosis effect pain , force transmission performance motion . Therefore , artificially create leg length difference may negative effect even though scoliosis improve . The benefit disadvantage use foot orthosis create artificial LLD order relieve idiopathic scoliosis require careful investigation . Although biomechanics spine low extremity study separately literature , biomechanical interaction spine low limbs scoliosis patient without LLD biomechanical effect treatment use foot orthosis patient remain studied . Using motion analysis technique , present study aim : 1. study biomechanical interaction spine low limbs scoliosis patient without LLD activity ; 2. investigate effect correction LLD use foot orthosis functional scoliotic spinal curve motion functional activity ; 3. test whether idiopathic scoliosis without LLD improve artificially create leg length discrepancy foot orthosis . The optimal height foot orthosis later two objective also determine . It hop present study lead well understanding mechanical interaction spine low extremity functional idiopathic scoliosis patient , good treatment patient .</detailed_description>
