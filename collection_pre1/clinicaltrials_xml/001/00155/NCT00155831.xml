	<brief_title>Neural Development Its Influencing Factors Premature Infants With Chronic Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past three decade , advancement perinatal neonatal care result marked improvement survival premature infant . However , offset increase incidence chronic lung disease ( CLD ) . Longitudinal follow-up study indicate premature infant resolve CLD high risk neurodevelopmental disability poorer cognitive performance school age compare without . Current approach treatment premature infant risk neurodevelopmental disability emphasize early assessment intervention within first year life optimize developmental outcome . However , information concern course early neuromotor development factor contribute neurodevelopmental disability premature infant CLD limit . Therefore , major purpose three-year multi-centered developmental follow-up study threefold . First , prospectively evaluate early neuromotor performance premature infant CLD premature infant without CLD birth 12 month correct age . Neuromotor performance assess use Neonatal Neurobehavioral Examination- Chinese version neonatal period , Alberta Infant Motor Scale three-dimensional video motion analysis system infancy . Secondly , follow neurodevelopmental outcome infant 12,18 24 month correct age identify early neuromotor impairment predict later neurodevelopmental disability . Neurodevelopmental outcome assess use Bayley Scale Infant Development- 2nd edition physician 's neurological diagnosis . Thirdly , examine two potential influence factor i.e. , respiratory disease brain lesion may contribute neurodevelopmental disability premature infant CLD . Respiratory disease assess use Clinical Roentgenographic Scoring Systems Assessing Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia neonatal period pulse oximeter infancy . Brain lesion assess cranial ultrasonography magnetic resonance imaging . This research project enroll 60 premature infant CLD 60 premature infant without CLD National Taiwan University Hospital MacKay Memorial Hospital . The group match birth weight . The result study help understand course nature early neuromotor development premature infant CLD . The obtain early neuromotor predictor assist clinician early detection infant great risk developmental disability need early intervention service . The identified factor adverse neurodevelopment premature infant CLD assist health care professional design prevention intervention program enhance developmental outcome . Furthermore , obtain database help develop national monitoring system measure developmental effect respiratory management early intervention program premature infant neonatal respiratory disease .</detailed_description>
