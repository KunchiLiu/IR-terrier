	<detailed_description>Progress Report Schizophrenia chronic devastate major psychiatric disorder . It cost lot individual patient , family well society . Schizophrenic patient occupy around 80 % chronic psychiatric bed . About 60 % acute psychiatric bed serve schizophrenic patient severe aggravate state illness . The majority schizophrenic patient need support family daily life . For good service patient , family well reduce social stigma schizophrenia patient , psychopathological understand crucial . However , schizophrenia complex disorder . For past one century , understand schizophrenia improve much . In Taiwan , psychopathological study schizophrenia deserve basic systematic approach clinical academic purpose . Before could possible understand essence psychopathology schizophrenia , descriptive psychopathology well document . The heterogeneity level clinical pathology delineate initial step psychopathological study schizophrenia . This crucial consideration cross-cultural application diagnostic criterion definition schizophrenia . The psychopathology disease category schizophrenia define DSM-IV system document mainly literature base descriptive study patient Caucasian population related culture . Western medicine Taiwan totally accept academic circle . From cross-cultural point view , way academic operation reflect methodologically examine empirically . Research schizophrenia psychopathology two kind value . The first frontier academic work World Psychiatry , study result contribute knowledge World Psychiatry Literature . The second native cultural value . The result could value reflect native cultural reality could value application study result clinical service . To frontier schizophrenia research , neuropsychological impairment underlined clinical manifestation schizophrenia one major area study . In contrast traditional theory psychological defense mechanism psychosocial explanation psychopathology schizophrenia , neuropsychological approach could provide way understand neural mechanism schizophrenia psychopathology level psychological function . In era neuroscience achievement , approach promise crucial . The basic psychopathology schizophrenia genetic factor etiology . In era molecular medicine , genetic epidemiological molecular genetic study schizophrenia psychopathology frontier line schizophrenia research . This research team lead Principal Investigator , Hai-Gwo Hwu , PPG begin approach July 1993 . The initial work start Multidimensional Psychopathological Group Research Project : Schizophrenia ” ( MPGRP ) . This MPGRP design base theoretical evolutionary model ( EM ) psychopathology invent Principal Investigator . This EM model include multiple psychopathological factor include genetic factor , brain insult , chronic developmental life experience , neurobiological manifestation , personality-adjustment factor , environmental stress biological psychological factor , familial social cultural value factor factor treatment . In EM model , disease course hypothesize three phase : initial subclinical stage , clinical stage , outcome stage treatment . This MPGRP thus design follow guidance EM psychopathological model . To design psychopathological study base EM psychopathology , necessary invent new methodological approach . This approach include serial multi-dimensional study design . The first step set-up smooth infrastructure collect cohort clinical schizophrenia case follow-up study , also collect schizophrenia family least two sibling affect schizophrenia molecular genetic study . This first step also consider descriptive psychopathological study , study search biological trait marker search identification linkage possible vulnerability genetic marker schizophrenia major research task . The initial project start MPGRP July 1993 till June 1998 , subsequent project follow initial MPGRP , Multidimensional Psychopathological Study Schizophrenia ( MPSS ) start July 1998 till June 2001 . The focus MPGRP study clinical manifestation schizophrenia family situation cohort schizophrenia patient . The MPGRP also focus phenotype definition schizophrenia use CPT manifestation schizophrenia family . CPT do family schizophrenic patient . The family least two sibling affect schizophrenia collect molecular genetic study . In MPSS project , focus follow-up neuropsychological evaluation schizophrenia cohort collect MPGRP , descriptive follow-up clinical data collection . Besides , MPSS also focus CPT WCST study family member family last two sibling affect schizophrenia . These family also sample molecular genetic study . The collection schizophrenia family kind molecular genetic study still work MPSS , collection kind family easy task . There several important feature characterize uniqueness MPGRP MPSS : ( 1 ) prospective follow-up design , ( 2 ) multidisciplinary approach , ( 3 ) multi-center , multi-hospital approach , ( 4 ) operationalized assessment schizophrenia psychopathology use “ Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ” ( PANSS ) ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) cover multi-dimensional psychopathological factor , ( 6 ) represent up-to-date psychopathological study phenotype definition , molecular genetic study , neuropsychological study , well study express emotion chief care giver family burden need care patient . This MPGRP MPSS successfully carry July 1993 March 2001 ( time send SEFOS proposal subsequent study pathogenesis schizophrenia , step psychopathological study schizophrenia ) base follow fact : 1 . This MPGRP MPSS make multidisciplinary team possible psychopathological study Taiwan . This easy task . Other technological breakthrough research administration manner , successful element multidisciplinary approach make smooth working infrastructure psychopathological research successive research work . Other research work , attend member research team obtain continuous training exercise psychopathological study . These achievement demonstrate literature publication . 2 . This MPGRP MPSS make multi-center , multi-hospital approach come true Taiwan psychopathological study . This institutional infrastructure guarantee sample schizophrenic case representative patient population psychopathological study . Other research administration breakthrough , approach provide great chance clinical psychiatrist participate training practice psychopathological basic training . Besides , clinical service team member , psychiatrist , include psychiatric nurse , psychologist , psychiatric social worker obtain common sense understand general psychopathological approach psychiatry . This close team approach make service team cohesive care patient . The patient attend study would obtain attention psychiatric service team lead research psychiatrist , especially successive follow-up study . This crucial elevate professional activity positive sense embed MPGRP MPSS research . This also one achievement MPGRP MPSS infrastructure research approach . These achievement demonstrate literature publication , demonstrate daily research practice activity . It also show subsequent research activity SEFOS project . 3 . This MPRP MPSS bring Taiwan Psychiatry frontier line psychopathological study contribute new knowledge schizophrenia literature . Besides , MPGRP MPSS also take care standpoint native culture background . The descriptive phenomenological approach essence operationalized psychopathological study . The cross-cultural modification justification Western rating schedule PANSS consider successfully do . 4 . The family schizophrenic patent also major area study base characteristic Taiwan culture . The family take responsibility patient care closely . The burden need patient care important topic study . Besides , take advantage culture background close family tie patient family , genetic study schizophrenia include genetic epidemiology molecular genetics one major task MGRP MPSS . 5 . Major academic achievement track PPG MPSS psychopathological study past 7 8 year include following : 1 . The finding different symptom cluster schizophrenia : Categorical dimensional approach schizophrenia psychopathology still current unsolved issue schizophrenia research . The MPGRP collect 234 schizophrenia subject Northern part Taiwan design cohort follow-up study 1993 . At end MPGRP , range from1998 2000 data analysis , descriptive psychopathological PANSS data assess admission analyze use explorative factor analysis ( EFA ) confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) , basic 4- dimensional model schizophrenia psychopathology establish . These 4 dimension : “ Negative associate Negative symptom ” , “ Disorganized think ” , “ Hostility/excitement ” , “ Delusion/hallucination ” . Including general psychopathological section PANSS , additional dimension anxiety/depression find EFA . The CFA find satisfactorily model model fit general psychopathology section include CFA . This could due high variability low base rate item general psychopathological section PANSS . Besides , could also due peripheral nature symptom item schizophrenia psychopathology . These finding confirm another statistical graphic approach , color graphic generalize association plot ( GAP ) delineate heterogeneity descriptive symptom pathology schizophrenia . In GAP analysis , 4-dimension model also find base PANSS data assess admission . These 4 dimension also arrange accord proximity matrix reveal follow order : ( 1 ) “ Negative symptom ” , ( 2 ) “ Disorganized think ” , ( 3 ) “ Hostility/Excitement ” . ( 4 ) “ Delusion/hallucination ” dimension . The possible dimension “ Anxiety/depression ” also observe near end dimension “ Negative symptom dimension ” . The validity symptom dimension assess use impairment sustain attention assess continuous performance test ( CPT ) . It find negative symptom dimension associate impaired CPT . Furthermore , severely impaired ( Z &gt; 3.0 ) ’ CPT find associate persistent negative symptom , deficit state clinical psychopathology , schizophrenia . The delusion/hallucination dimension find associate impaired neuronal activity hippocampal region measure neuroimaging technology Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry ( MRS ) . The GAP analysis base successive PANSS data assess admission , 6-month , 1-year 2-year follow-up also show stable 5-dimension model psychopathology . The component symptom dimension data ass admission . These dimension “ Negative symptom ” , “ Disorganized think ” , “ Hostility/excitement ” , “ Delusion/hallucination ” “ Anxiety/depression ” . This research team develop concept core symptom dimension select stable symptom item appear stably follow course 4 successive assessment across 2-year follow-up . The validity core psychopathological dimension compose core , stable symptom cluster item still investigation . 2 . The finding different subgroup schizophrenia patient : Based cohort follow-up design , possible search possibility existence different subgroup patient categorical approach . Matched effort differentiate symptom dimension psychopathology , also possible define different subgroup patient base composition symptom dimension . This research team invent analytical approach call GAP analysis purpose . The result partly show website : http : //gap.stat.sinica.edu.tw . Based admission PANSS data , GAP find 4 symptom cluster “ Negative symptom ” , “ Disorganized think ” , “ Hostility/excitement ” , “ Delusion/hallucination ” , also two subgroup patient ( GWNEG ) without ( GONEG ) mark negative symptom . These two group patient find validity manifestation clinical symptom dimension follow-up course CPT performance . Besides , two subgroup also differ treatment response prognostic outcome show social function . The GAP analysis , base follow-up data PANSS assessment , also find consistently 4 -dimensional model schizophrenia psychopathology . One additional dimension anxiety/depression also find . The patient subgrouping consistently find three patient subgroup 6-month , 1-year 2-year follow-up . One low psychopathology group ( good treatment response group ) , mark blunt group last persistent delusion/hallucination group . The concordance GWNEG GONEG three group still investigation . 3 . Impaired sustained attention continuous performance test ( CPT ) trait marker schizophrenia . We use CPT machine Sunrise Systems , version 2.20 ( Pembroke , MA , USA ) . The procedure describe detail I publication . Briefly , number 0 9 randomly present 50 millisecond , rate one per second . Each subject undertook two CPT session : undegraded 1-9 task degrade 1-9 task . The sensitivity index ( d ) CPT performance reflect subject 's sustained attention . Family study indicate sustained attention deficit measure CPT vulnerability marker schizophrenia . The result : ( 1 ) substantial proportion non-psychotic relative schizophrenia probands ( 19-34 % ) CPT deficit , predict probands ’ CPT performance ; ( 2 ) subject schizotypal personality feature also exhibit CPT deficit , specifically associate negative factor schizotypy ; ( 3 ) CPT deficits present schizophrenic patient , particularly associate negative disorganize symptom , difficult CPT version amenable neuroleptic treatment . 4 . The familial tendency schizophrenia Taiwan schizophrenia proband In MPGRP MPSS stdy , Diagnostic Interview Schedule Genetic Study ( DIGS ) schizotypy interview schedule ( SIS ) translate modify useful Taiwan subject . The Perceptual aberration scale ( PAS ) Schizotypal personality questionnaire ( SPQ ) also use community study schizophrenia-related personality disorder . The cross-cultural consideration employ . In community study , schizophrenia-related personality disorder assess use PAS SPQ initially DIGS SIS interview . Including schizophrenia-related personality disorder spectrum increase power linkage analysis schizophrenia . This one important information molecular genetic study MPGRP MPSS . 5 . Explorative neurobiological study schizophrenic sample MPGRP MPSS project . The neuropsychological study MPSS design impact concept endophenotype molecular genetic study induce MPSS research team explore role neurophysiological parameter P50 inhibition neurochemical parameter neuronal activity show Magnetic Resonance Imaging Spectrometry ( MRS ) relative concentration various specific biochemical molecule choline creatinine . The P50 study relate neurophysiological study provide chance study implicit explicit study paradigm schizophrenia . The implicit learning color schizophrenia fond significantly impair compare control . The 3-D dimension display brain energy P50 study show energy distribution schizophrenic patient significantly different control . The MRS study show positive symptom cluster correlate decreased neuronal activity hippocampal region . These study result make possible research tem design research family member schizophrenia proband pathogenesis genetic study multi-etiological factor interaction use neurobiological parameter design SEFOS , investigation dynamic pathogenetic process schizophrenia , lead Principal Investigator smooth work infrastructure multidimensional psychopathological study schizophrenia . 6 . Molecular genetic study locate vulnerability gene different chromosome region . Linkage study association study perform project locate vulnerability gene schizophrenia examine warm spot schizophrenia chromosome region chromosome 1q , 6p , 8p , 15q . The study result , far obtained laboratory use 52 Taiwanese family least 2 sibling affect schizophrenia , could exclude possible existence schizophrenia vulnerability gene location chromosome region . Further study PPG SEFOS focus position 5 marker potential linkage find closer genetic marker possibly link schizophrenia use closer genetic marker combination dinucleotide SNP marker . The candidate gene around genetic marker also explore search mutation related pathological variation schizophrenia . This focus PPG SEFOS follow MPGRP MPSS . This laboratory explore possibility candidate gene approach base plausible animal model schizophrenia and/or pathophysiological process schizophrenia . The NMDA subunit R1 receptor gene nicotinic receptor alpha 7 subtype gene two gene exploration . The skin test niacin test also explore laboratory possible association genetic defect phospholipid metabolism relate gene . These include PPG SEFOS study future . 7 . Expressed emotion burden family schizophrenic patient The family unit study also concern MPGRP MPSS . The expressed emotion consider stable trait family chief caregiver hypothesize specific psychopathological meaning schizophrenia . However , express emotion Taiwanese schizophrenia family find change accord course illness . It stable . The family burden find high specific clinical measure relieve thee family burden design well clinical service schizophrenia family . 8 . Invention statistical method psychopathological study The multivariate nature psychopathological data demand invention novel statistical method data management . In MPGRP MPSS , analysis 33 PANSS symptom subgrouping patient study schizophrenia heterogeneity invite development new color graphic approach exploration symptom dimension patent subgrouping . This name Generalized Association Plots ( GAP ) . This demonstrate fruitful approach multi-disciplinary team-work psychopathological study . 9 . Data bank establishment MPGRP MPSS . In past 7 8 year MPGRP MPSS work , important data bank clinical psychopathology schizophrenia establish . These data bank useful successive data analysis test various hypothesis related issue heterogeneity schizophrenia . These data bank include ( 1 ) basic clinical data bank schizophrenia cohort 234 case follow-up clinical data 7 year follow-up data , ( 2 ) data bank objective rating PANSS , ESRS , CDRS , ( 3 ) neuropsychological test data bank successive follow-up neuropsychological evaluation . The DNA bank cell-line bank family schizophrenia relate disorder also important molecular genetic evaluation . Other DNA data bank MPGRP MPSS , laboratory also perform Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study ( TSLS ) collaboration researcher Harvard Medical School support NIMH , U.S.A. , collect 600 family least two sibling affect schizophrenia . This data bank include DIGS , DNA CPT well WCST . This research team use data set replicate initial finding obtain laboratory originally . This one major focus subsequent SEFOS PPG . All data bank justify abundant resource data continuous data analysis paper publication SEFOS PPG , reason SEFOS set core contain statistical sub-core unit operation data analysis . Up present , research team mature enough continuous data analysis serial hypothesis test . All data provide evidence grant SEFOS , apparently , achieve expect result research team great confidence . 6 . The progress MPSS ( July , 1998 – June 2001 ) till March , 2001 PPG SEFOS propose . Three sub-projects report follow : 1 ) Phenomenological neuropsychological manifestation schizophrenia : prospective follow-up study . ( 2 ) A family-genetic study co-affected sib-pairs schizophrenia . ( 3 ) Molecular genetic study schizophrenia use co-affected sib-pair association strategy . In conclusion , MPSS go smoothly data collection well data analysis . The paper publication go steadily . These three sub-projects integrate coordinated smoothly . Besides , preliminary work use neurobiological technology neurophysiology brain Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry ( MRS ) measurement psychopathological related manifestation perform . These technology prove satisfactorily stable applicable psychopathological study . The preliminary result obtain manuscript prepared submission . Actually , technology also extend brain part include frontal region measurement tractography also available image laboratory National Taiwan University Hospital .
