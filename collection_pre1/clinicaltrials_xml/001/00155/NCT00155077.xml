	<detailed_description>Carcinoma uterine cervix serious health problem . In Taiwan , cervical cancer common malignant neoplasm 5th leading cause cancer death woman ( carcinoma lung , liver , colorectum breast ) . The Department Health estimate 2000 2,720 new case invasive carcinoma cervix 971 death disease , addition 3,566 case carcinoma situ ( 1 ) . The traditional treatment invasive cervical cancer surgery radiotherapy , certain situation , combination . Most woman early-stage cervical cancer cure radical surgery radiotherapy . Those large cervical lesion presentation spread pelvic lymph node pelvic tissue usually treat combination external-beam intracavitary radiation . ( 2-6 ) To eradicate micrometastases sensitize tumor cell radiation , several study explore use radiotherapy concomitant chemotherapy . ( 7-10 ) Because patient cervical cancer usually present disease clinically confine pelvis , locoregional disease control primary challenge physician . Treatment carefully tailor surgery radiotherapy produce impressive cure rate patient early-stage disease . Primary radiotherapy early-stage disease offer cure rate equivalent radical hysterectomy . For locally advanced disease , spread beyond uterus ( stage IIB IVA accord stag system International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ) , radiotherapy primary modality treatment . For patient , cure rate decrease advance stage tumor bulk . ( 11 ) A significant reason treatment failure many patient inability achieve control primary cancer first-echelon lymph node metastasis . ( 12 ) Improvement local control expect lead improved cure rate . ( 13 ) Simply increase dose RT increase local control rate , expense increase complication rate . ( 14 ) Once cervical cancer extend beyond cervix , cure radical surgery alone unlikely . After report several randomized clinical trial show improvement time progression survival patient give chemoradiotherapy compare radiotherapy alone . ( 15-18 ) chemoradiotherapy consider standard care locally advance ( stage IIB–IVA ) high-risk early-stage cervical cancer . Radical radiotherapy effective patient locoregionally confined cervical cancer stage . Treatment must carefully tailor patient extent disease usually consist combination external-beam irradiation brachytherapy . Overall , report 5-year survival rate patient treated radiation alone approximately 75 % 85 % stage IB , 65 % 75 % stage II , 30 % 50 % stage III , 10 % 20 % stage IVA disease . Within stage subset , cure rate strongly correlate size primary tumor extent regional involvement . ( 17 , 18 ) For locally advanced disease , systematic review meta-analysis report use chemoradiotherapy generally support use chemoradiotherapy radiotherapy alone , neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow radiotherapy . ( 19 ) Chemoradiotherapy show improve overall survival 30 % reduce risk local distant recurrence . Absolute survival benefit estimate 12 % , though several study report high survival benefit . Angiogenesis play important role pathogenesis cancer ( 20 ) . Recent study relate angiogenesis cancer growth metastasis ( 21 ) . The growth solid tumor metastatic spread angiogenesis dependent confirm several experimental clinical study ( 22 , 23 ) . Ultrasonography use gynecologic field decade . Our previous study show incremental angiogenesis could demonstrate tumorigenesis ovarian , endometrial malignancy , cervical caner . ( 24-28 ) Besides , growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , IL-6 also report correlate angiogenesis prognosis cervical cancer ( 29-31 ) , ovarian cancer ( 32 ) , endometrial cancer ( 27 , 33 ) . Tumor angiogenesis cervical cancer prove correlated disease severity prognosis cervical cancer patient early stage ( 26 , 29 , 30 , 34 ) . It seem tumor angiogenesis could utilize good marker survey severity disease prognosis early-staged cervical cancer patient . However , good method marker could utilize monitor response radiotherapy evaluate prognosis cervical cancer patient advance stage . So would like propose proposal focus tumor angiogenesis cervical cancer patient advance stage . Cervical cancer patient receive radiotherapy concurrent chemoradiotherapy enrol study . Transvaginal sonography angiogenesis-related growth factor evaluate monitor response treatment patient . There several purpose study . First , evaluate kinetic change tumor angiogenesis cervical cancer patient receive radiotherapy concurrent chemoradiotherapy . Second , evaluate tumor angiogenesis could marker monitor response radiotherapy concurrent chemoradiotherapy cervical cancer patient . The relation tumor angiogenesis radiotherapy explore clarified study . The comprehensive role tumor angiogenesis cervical cancer elucidate result study .</detailed_description>
