	<brief_summary>Periorbital rejuvenation issue great interest plastic surgery . Adipose tissue play important role periorbital anatomy , great impact age process region . We believe age-related atrophy facial adipose tissue may relate decreased proliferation differentiation capability preadipocytes ( adipose precursor cell ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Age-Related Changes Proliferation Differentiation Capacity Human Preadipocytes From Periorbital Fat .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Understanding age-related change periorbital adipose tissue crucial improve current rejuvenation technique , develop new one . However , study report literature . Hundreds people come hospital request upper blepharoplasty every year . Taking advantage discard soft tissue blepharoplasty surgery , sample bilateral pretarsal fat easily obtain patient various age . This study design objectively evaluate age-related change preadipocytes human periorbital adipose tissue regard proliferation differentiation capability . The adipose sample take surgery sent lab immediately separate preadipocytes specimen . Their number estimate microscope , cell culture vitro evaluate proliferation differentiation capability . Proliferation assess count number preadipocyte everyday 7 day , differentiation assess Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GPDH ) assay . A linear regression analysis use analyze correlation parameter age . Moreover , divide subject periorbital fat sample upper blepharoplasty operation three age group , parameter compare ANOVA test . Therefore , age-related change proliferation differentiation capability preadipocytes human periorbital adipose tissue conclude .</detailed_description>
