	<brief_title>Comparison Laparoscopic Colectomy Versus Open Colectomy Colorectal Cancer : … A Prospective Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The appropriateness laparoscopic surgery resection colorectal cancer focus controversy . The pro insist besides small wound size , laparoscopic colectomy induce less perioperative stress , evidence less pain , quicker flatus passage , early feeding , rapid resume daily activity work . Moreover , since laparoscopic colectomy induces less immunosuppression , may potentially positive treatment colorectal cancer patient . However , con insist first , summation 4 5 port , incisional wound retrieve specimen laparoscopic colectomy consider , total wound size laparoscopic colectomy basically similar open colectomy . Secondly , since laparoscopic surgeon advocate extent intra-abdominal dissection laparoscopic open colectomy , seem illogical speculate laparoscopic procedure less invasive colorectal cancer patient open procedure . Moreover , regard short-term improvement life quality ( base evaluation parameter include less painful , quicker flatus passage , feeding , resume daily activity , return work , etc . ) , deny potential benefit sacrifice spending money , therefore , still unknown laparoscopic colectomy cost-effective . Thirdly important , laparoscopic colectomy difficult surgeon , therefore learn curve difficult overcome . Moreover , many surgeon concern pneumoperitoneum laparoscopic procedure reinforce intraperitoneal spread colorectal cancer . Based above-mentioned reason , many colorectal surgeon hesisted line safety efficacy laparoscopic colectomy . However , apparently , laparoscopic colectomy enthusiastically use many colorectal surgeon Taiwan , Japan , Europe , USA , around 10 year . Further clarification controversy cite base evidence-based medicine , i.e. , randomize , well-controlled , prospective clinical trial . Actually , handful randomize prospective data regard laparoscopic colectomy appear USA Europe . However , still kind data Taiwan , therefore study important mandatory .
