	<brief_summary>Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) develop promise new cancer treatment modality , involve uptake photosensitizer tumor cell , follow activation photosensitizer approximate wavelength light . The mechanisms PDT-induced cytotoxic effect relate singlet oxygen reactive oxygen intermediate generate PDT , give rise cellular stress cause cell death . Previously , use homemade LED light source , show ALA-PDT effective treatment premalignant lesion mucosal dysplasia carcinoma situ oral cavity . Due advantage low cost , high reliability , portability , LED light source provide alternative approach light irradiation PDT . Verruca vulgaris benign skin papilloma cause human papilloma virus ( HPV ) . They common affect many different site include face , hand , foot genitalia . Although present therapeutic approach less effective eradicating lesion , relapse common . Furthermore , time anatomical location depth lesion often make treatment difficult , time-consuming painful . Therefore , necessary develop new modality wart treatment . The purpose clinical trial develop topical ALA-PDT alternative treatment wart without unwanted side effect pain burn . To fulfill goal , follow work perform . First , topical ALA formulation LED array specifically design develop skin lesion . Second , efficacy ALA formulation design wart treatment evaluate vivo fluorescence image system . Third , therapeutic efficacy ALA-PDT evaluate use LED array design skin irradiation . Forth , unwanted side effect pain burn compare red green LED array .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Verruca vulgaris wart benign skin papilloma cause human papilloma virus ( HPV ) . They common affect many different site include face , hand , foot genitalia . Although present therapeutic approach less effective eradicating lesion , scar relapse common . Furthermore , time anatomical location depth lesion often make treatment difficult , time-consuming painful . Therefore , necessary develop new modality wart treatment . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) develop promise new cancer treatment modality , involve uptake photosensitizer tumor cell , follow activation photosensitizer approximate wavelength light . The endogenous conversion 5-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX ) broaden use PDT . The mechanisms PDT-induced cytotoxic effect relate singlet oxygen reactive oxygen intermediate generate PDT , give rise cellular stress cause cell death . Previously , use homemade LED light source , show topical ALA-PDT effective treatment wart . However , excruciate pain induce ALA red LED could due deep penetration ALA formulation deeper penetration red light . Thus pain might relate injured nerve fiber underlie skin . This study provide evidence two green red LED efficacy remove wart also side-effect pain .</detailed_description>
