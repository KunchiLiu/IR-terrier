	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop determine effectiveness multi-level community participatory intervention design rapidly immunize hard-to-reach population , include substance user , within disadvantage minority community . Specific Aims project follow : 1 . To identify relative contribution personal factor structural barrier immunization status hard-to-reach population . 2 . To estimate size hard-to-reach population specify disadvantaged urban community use venue-based sampling , probability-based sampling , capture-recapture method modify Delphi technique . 3 . To compare vaccination rate hard-to-reach population neighborhood receive community-based vaccine outreach intervention versus neighborhood vaccine offer standard public health program , use incremental crossover multilevel community intervention design .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Vaccination Hard-To-Reach Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study follow quasi-experimental design involve multilevel community participatory intervention design rapidly immunize hard-to-reach ( HTR ) population disadvantage minority community . Low vaccination coverage among minority person live near poverty persistent problem particularly acute among HTR population ( e.g . injection drug user , elderly shut-in ) . Immunization rate affect multiple factor include demographic , attitude vaccination , health norm , barrier access , immunization delivery method . Efforts successfully vaccinate HTR population must address factor . A community-based program rapid vaccination serve initial model emergency preparedness vaccination plan future effort widely introduce HIV vaccination disadvantage urban community . This project conduct community-public health partnership eight disadvantage neighborhood within Harlem South Bronx three phase . In Phase 1 implement brief survey assessment resident designate neighborhood identify current key barrier immunization face target HTR population neighborhood . Also , use several estimation method , determine size target population study neighborhood establish vaccine need estimate denominator vaccination rate . In Phase 2 , implement two wave multilevel community intervention trial ( develop input survey community partner ) . In first wave , four randomly select neighborhood receive intervention ( i.e. , community education , community-organization engagement , door-to-door influenza vaccination program eligible group etc ) . In four control community , target population invite come vaccination specify location part usual public health effort . In second vaccination wave , use crossover design , update revise approach base experience Wave 1 , implement intervention four control community ; vaccination wave conduct one week test feasibility rapid vaccination population . Phase 3 project identify promising element program develop material allow generalizability urban area vaccine ( e.g. , HIV , HBV , etc ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The possible participant pool project adult population ( age 18 ) 8 circumscribe neighborhood East Harlem South Bronx NYC . These neighborhood total population approximately 24,000 people ( base 2000 US Census ) anticipate 4,000 may among eligible hardtoreach population target proposal . We identify eligible population brief survey instrument . During intervention phase study , person eligible receive influenza vaccination offer influenza vaccination . Eligibility criterion influenza vaccination eligibility criterion establish Advisory Committee Immunization Practices guideline . These determined part standard data collection instrument . Eligible person include person age 65 person concurrent comorbidity include immunosuppression ( HIV active injection drug use ) , chronic pulmonary cardiovascular disorder ( include asthma ) , chronic metabolic disease ( include diabetes mellitus , renal hepatic dysfunction ) . Exclusion criterion include allergy vaccine , allergy egg , inability provide consent , currently care physician plan receive influenza vaccine nearfuture , already receive influenza vaccine year ( CDC 1999 ) .</criteria>
