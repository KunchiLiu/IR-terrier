	<brief_title>Docetaxel , Cisplatin Capecitabine Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label phase II trial design test effect toxicity profile combination docetaxel , cisplatin , capecitabine locally advanced breast cancer patients.Breast cancer one leading cause cancer death woman Taiwan . Despite advance multidisciplinary treatment , significant number patient eventually develop metastatic disease , especially present locally advanced breast cancer ( LABC ) . LABC remain important challenging problem practice . In LABC , treatment strategy include neoadjuvant chemotherapy several potential advantage : early initiation systemic therapy , vivo assessment response , downstaging primary tumor regional lymphatic metastasis , make breast-conserving surgery option many . The potential theoretical shortcoming include delay local treatment , introduction drug resistance , unreliability clinical staging . In practice , advantage exceed disadvantage . Clinical trial demonstrate docetaxel capecitabine highly effective treatment metastatic breast cancer . On hand , previous study demonstrate combination taxane cisplatin highly effective treatment locally advance metastatic breast cancer . We design combination chemotherapy use docetaxel cisplatin capecitabine treatment locally advance breast cancer .</detailed_description>
