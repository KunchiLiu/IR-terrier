	<detailed_description>Malignancy first cause death Taiwan . There around 30,000 people die due malignancy every year . Ovarian cancer first mortality rate gynecologic malignancy . The incidence ovarian cancer increase recent 10 year . Ovarian cancer indeed disease respect , however , research work focus Taiwan . To study mechanisms carcinogenesis ovarian cancer help u understand disease develop new strategy diagnosis prevention ovarian cancer future . The present diagnostic method malignancy clinical symptom , physical examination , evaluation tumor marker instrument . It important issue diagnose cancer earlier improve survival cancer patient . By development biomedical science , many gene identify related carcinogenesis . If detect possibility genetic mutation earlier , may deal suspected area malignancy soon possible . To present knowledge , carcinogenesis ovarian cancer strong correlation special gene BRCA1 BRCA2 gene . There 1 200 normal population BRCA1 BRCA2 gene mutation western country . The incidence BRCA1 BRCA2 gene mutation even increase 30-50 % population familial ovarian cancer . Women BRCA1 gene mutation 80 % get breast cancer age 70 63 % would get ovarian cancer age 70 . Women BRCA2 gene mutation 80 % get breast ovarian cancer age 70 . It seem genetic diagnosis BRCA1/BRCA2 clinical practice . The development new instrument- denature high-performance liquid chromatography ( DHPLC ) use automate detection find minute single mutation nucleotide . It apply clinical service utilize DHPLC genetic diagnosis BRCA1 BRCA2 breast cancer patient department Genetic Medicine hospital . It become powerful tool establish database BRCA1 BRCA2 gene mutation ovarian cancer patient Taiwan , use technique DHPLC combine direct DNA sequencing . So propose research project . There two main purpose project . First , utilize new technique DHPCL direct DNA sequence set database BRCA1 BRCA2 gene mutation ovarian cancer patient Taiwan . We screen BRCA1 BRCA2 gene mutation high-risk group new technique . And provide patient suitable genetic consulting relate treatment planning . Second , would lie set new technique DHPLC combine direct DNA sequence genetic diagnosis ovarian cancer patient future clinical service hospital .</detailed_description>
