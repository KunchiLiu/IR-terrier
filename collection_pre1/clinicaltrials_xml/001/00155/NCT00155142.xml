	<brief_summary>To address follow issue : ( 1 ) course small nerve fiber degeneration type 2 diabetic patient , especially asymptomatic patient ; ( 2 ) influence blood sugar control development small fiber degeneration ; ( 3 ) correlation skin innervation sensory threshold , autonomic test parameter nerve conduction study ; ( 4 ) role neurotrophins diabetic neuropathy , perform skin biopsy quantification IENF type 2 diabetic patient without neurological symptom . The investigation include clinical evaluation , electrophysiological study , quantitative sensory test enzyme link immunosorbent assay neurotrophins . The analysis skin innervation diabetic parameter give important insight mechanism , prevention management small fiber neuropathy neurologically asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patient , also therapeutic strategy diabetic neuropathy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Skin Innervation Neurologically Asymptomatic Type 2 Diabetic Patients : Correlation With Diabetic Parameters Neurotrophins .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes one common disorder general population . The overall prevalence type 2 diabetes among people older 40 year old Taiwan 10 % . Various complication associate diabetes complication become important issue daily clinical practice . Neuropathy one frequent symptomatic complication diabetes potentially devastating . Small-fiber neuropathy major component diabetic neuropathy usually cause disable symptom like pain burning . It typically begin distal limbs progress proximal part time . Recent study indicate skin innervation reduce neurologically symptomatic type 2 diabetic patient reduction correlate duration diabetes1 . It clear whether similar change occur neurologically asymptomatic type 2 diabetes . Neurovascular disturbance ( i.e . decrease skin blood flow ) note early clinically silent diabetic patient might represent functional organic abnormality small unmyelinated C fiber . Along line reasonable speculate might change skin innervation preclinical phase diabetic neuropathic patient . No previous study investigate course change skin innervation early asymptomatic stage symptomatic stage diabetic patient . The relationship diabetes occurrence peripheral neuropathy study Diabetes Control Complications Trial Research Group Kumamoto study type 1 2 diabetes respectively . The result show intensive control hyperglycemia could prevent delay development diabetic neuropathy . However neuropathies study assess nerve conduction study . These examination insensitive small fiber degeneration clear whether small fiber change intensive diabetic control . There also lack direct pathogenic evidence regard effect diabetic control development small fiber degeneration . Neurotrophins gene family structurally related protein release target tissue responsive peripheral nerve , bind specific receptor , regulate gene expression action second-messenger system . Each member family selectively tropical effect peripheral nerve play role promote neurite outgrowth , induce morphological differentiation , stimulate expression release neurotransmitter promote nerve regeneration . It hypothesize abnormal availability neurotrophins involve pathogenesis diabetic neuropathy . Studies show reduced seral level neurotrophins diabetic patient clear whether impact find diabetic neuropathy . There study demonstrate nay correlation abnormal neurotrophins expression pathogenesis small fiber neuropathy diabetic patient . Skin biopsy quantification intraepidermal nerve fiber ( IENF ) new pathological approach study small fiber sensory neuropathy . By apply technique enzyme link immunosorbent assay , clarify follow issue : 1 . Changes skin innervation neurologically asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patient . 2 . The influence diabetic control development small fiber neuropathy . 3 . The effect neurotrophins pathogenesis small fiber neuropathy .</detailed_description>
