	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate validity reliability measurement cervical multifidus use ultrasonography , investigate cervical multifidus muscle function change pattern multifidus thickness , compare change muscle thickness among different resistance level ( rest , 25 % , 50 % , 75 % 100 % ) different cervical level ( C4 , C5 C6 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cervical multifidus specific sensory motion function . However , unclear muscle architectural change cervical multifidus head retraction manoeuvre progressive resistance . The validity reliability measure cervical multifidus use ultrasonography ’ proven . In pilot study , thickness , width area multifidus measure C4 , C5 C6 measure use MRI ultrasonography . The limit agreement regression analysis use compare result two modality . Besides , muscle thickness repeatedly measure static head retraction manoeuvre use ultrasonography rater day ; CVw CVb use investigate reliability . In main study , multifidus architecture measure twenty asymptomatic subject ( 24.3±4.7 yo , 5 woman 15 men ) head retraction manoeuvre progressive resistance relaxation use ultrasonography apparatus 10MHz linear transducer . ANOVA repeat measurement post-hoc analysis investigate difference among different cervical level resistance force level . The result pilot study show limit agreement ±0.20 cm moderate level correlation ( R2 range 0.42~0.64 ) muscle thickness measure MRI ultrasonography . For muscle thickness , CVw value static head retraction maximum resistance lower 10 % . In main study , curvilinear relationship muscle thickness change resistance , quadratic equation proper curve estimation . There significant difference muscle thickness change within 50 % maximum retraction resistance ; significant difference among three cervical level . It suggest muscle C6 relax slowly period begin relaxation . In conclusion , present study build valid reliable method measure continuous dynamic change muscle thickness use ultrasonography . The result support muscle function cervical multifidus segmental stability force production .</detailed_description>
