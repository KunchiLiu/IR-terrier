	<brief_summary>There 2 part study . First part : - Reliability water displacement , circumference , tonometer . - Effect taping : lifting effect measure sonography - Effect taping : peripheral circulation measure DRT4 Second part : - Effects different intervention model include decongestive lymphatic therapy ( DLT ) modify DLT</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Lymphedema : Application Kinesio Taping</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First part : To investigate reliability study water displacement circumference measurement change thickness subcutaneous space measure sonography blood flow measure DRT4 normal subject apply K-tape . Second part : The incidence breast carcinoma second place woman Taiwan . Lymphedema common complication treatment breast carcinoma ; lead cosmetic problem also uncomfortable , cause functional limitation patient . The common management lymphedema decongestive lymphatic therapy ( DLT ) include skin care , manual lymph drainage , remedial exercise compression therapy . At present , possible compression therapy lymphedema limitation . Patients poor compliance use short-stretch bandage compression garment due climate Taiwan . Applying kinesio tape ( K-tape ) become new treatment method physical therapy ; inventor Dr. Kase claim K-tape improve circulation remove congestion . Besides , demonstrate good therapeutic effect clinical application . However , study show clinical effect K-tape . This restrict application K-tape . Following previous study , purpose compare effect among traditional DLT , modify DLT replaces bandage K-tape , DLT combine K-tape patient lymphedema . A randomized control study execute . Sixty patient post-mastectomy lymphedema randomly group tap , bandage mixed group . Each subject go 4 week control period , 4 week intervention period , follow 3 month observation period . The evaluation item include physical therapy assessment , severity swelling , arm circumference , volume water displacement , relate symptom , upper extremity function quality life . The evaluation execute 4 week intervention ( start control period ) , intervention ( start intervention period ) , 4 week intervention 3 month intervention compare effect among 3 kind treatment . Subjects group receive treatment include skin care , manual lymphatic drainage , pneumatic compression therapy exercise intervention period ; tap group ’ patient receive additional K-tape treatment ; mixed group ’ patient receive K-tape combined bandage treatment . Each group treat 2 hours/time , 5 times/week ; entire course take 4 week .</detailed_description>
