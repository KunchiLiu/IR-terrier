	<brief_title>Bi-Weekly Docetaxel Plus 24-Hour Infusion High-Dose 5-Fluorouracil / Leucovorin ( HDFL ) Inoperable Advanced Metastatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer one leading cause cancer death Taiwan . We previously demonstrate weekly 24-hour infusion high-dose 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) leucovorin effective well-tolerated regimen patient advance gastric cancer . Our vitro clinical study suggest long ( 24 hour ) infusion 5-FU/leucovorin may , compare conventional bolus regimen , enhance anti-tumor activity gastric cancer prolong suppression thymidylate synthase , target enzyme 5-FU cytotoxicity . Docetaxel , mitotic inhibitor , good single-agent activity gastric cancer , tumor response rate around 20 24 % . Preliminary clinical data indicate biweekly administration docetaxel reduce incidence neutropenia asthenia , two bothersome side effect tri-weekly weekly docetaxel , respectively , maintain anti-tumor activity . This phase II trial design test efficacy toxicity biweekly docetaxel 24-hour infusion high-dose 5-FU/leucovorin first-line therapy patient inoperable advanced gastric cancer .</detailed_description>
