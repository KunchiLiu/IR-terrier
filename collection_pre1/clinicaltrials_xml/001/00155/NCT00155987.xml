	<brief_summary>This multi-centre randomise trial evaluate effect early decompressive craniectomy neurological function patient severe traumatic brain injury . The primary outcome neurological function measure 6 month post injury use Glasgow Outcome Score . Neurological function qualify proportion favourable outcome ( Glasgow Outcome Score Extended [ GOSE ] grade 5-8 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Comparison After meet entry criterion , patient randomise either early DC surgery ( see ) best current conventional management . Those randomised surgery operation do within 6 hour randomisation . They return ICU manage thereafter way conventional arm . Patients conventional arm usual therapy increase ICP optimise . They may cool 35.0C thiopentone bolus thiopentone coma . These option clinician discretion . Late DC surgery control patient discourage however may do neurosurgeon discretion . These patient include intention treat analysis . Surgical Technique The technique describe Polin use . The operation comprise bi-frontal decompressive craniectomies single fronto-temporal bone flap extend across midline . The temporalis muscle reflect inferiorly . Burr hole locate either side sagittal sinus posterior extent bilaterally keyhole root zygoma . This create large bifrontal craniectomy defect extend posteriorly coronal suture . Bilateral large sub-temporal decompression perform skull base . The final bone cut make along supra-orbital ridge attempt preserve frontal sinus . Burr hole place either side sagittal sinus inferiorly bone lift . The dura open one two alternative way : 1 . The dura open cruciate incision bilaterally . OR 2 . A large L shape incision lower corner L face laterally . The advantage method cerebral vein disturb medially incision . The dural opening cover dural facial patch , brain adhere scalp . Water tight dural closure necessarily aim . For patient receive EVD monitoring , ICP monitor ventricular catheter ( ± optional PO2 temperature monitor ) may place prior closure . Some patient randomise parenchymal catheter . These patient EVD insert . The bone flap replace bone swell resolve patient improve leave intensive care unit ( 6-12 week ) . The bone flap store minus 20o-70oC reinsertion may implant subcutaneous tissue abdominal wall alternative .</detailed_description>
