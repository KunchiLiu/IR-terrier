	<brief_title>A Prospective Single-Blinded Randomized Trial Comparing Colonoscopic Preparation Different Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) lead cause cancer death Western country also Taiwan . It third lead cause cancer mortality men woman Taiwan . Previous study reveal early detection adenomatous polyp , precursor lesion CRC , play pivotal role CRC prevention removal lesion prove reduce CRC mortality . Fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) standard mass screening modality colonoscopy standard procedure choice FOBT positive . Nevertheless , colonoscopy gradually accept one powerful tool colorectal cancer screen . Not survey positive fecal test , also apply primary screening modality CRC screening.Colon cleanse colonoscopy thus become critically important inadequate preparation may lead low diagnostic yield miss lesion , increase risk complication prolong procedure time . Though importance good colon preparation over-emphasized , diet control colonoscopy ingestion large amount lavage solution remain significant hurdle overcome investigator continue seek ideal colon preparation respect quality examinee satisfaction . After introduction polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution ( PEG-ELS ) bowel preparation colon procedure , safety well document efficacy colon cleanse proven efficient . The timing ingest PEG-ELS different institute ingest PEG-ELS whole night colonoscopic examination ingest split-dose manner ingest half solution previous night remain day examination . Some institute ask examinee receive lavage solution day examination . The manufacturer advice start take medication day investigation accord printed instruction package PEG-ELS . Though lot study conduct describe result colon cleanse different fashion , result still controversial . This prospective , randomize , single-blinded trail evaluate compare efficacy colon preparation two timing colon preparation , namely , previous night day colonoscopic examination . In study , enrol already colon neoplasia detect voluntary routine health check-up receive second colonoscopic examination either elective polypectomy endoscopic mucosectomy ( EMR ) . We use cleanse condition reference adequate preparation ; also compare diagnostic yield lesion number objective comparator two method .</detailed_description>
