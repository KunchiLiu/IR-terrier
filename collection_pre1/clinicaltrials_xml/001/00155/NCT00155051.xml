	<brief_summary>Long term treatment progestin demonstrate inhibitory effect endometrial angiogenesis proliferation endometrial stromal cell . As result , progestin widely employ treatment endometrial cancer , endometrial hyperplasia , dysfunction uterine bleeding . In treatment adenomyosis , however , beneficial effect progestin limit . It might imply behavior endometrial cell woman adenomyosis different woman without adenomyosis . Our previous study reveal expression killer inhibitory receptor ( KIRs ) NK cell decrease eutopic endometrium woman adenomyosis . It may compensatory effect NK cytotoxicity activate order wipe abnormal endometrial cell might go eutopic site endometrium . It imply formation adenomyosis might due “ abnormal ” endometrial tissue , aberrant local immunological dysfunction myometrium . This find compatible previous report eutopic endometrium obtain woman endometriosis adenomyosis find behave differently endometrium unaffected woman . In study , try collect endometrial tissue woman without adenomyosis , purify endometrial stromal cell endometrium . The endometrial stromal cell culture 8 day supplement medroxyprogesterone ( MPA ) danazol . Quantification IL-6 IL-8 mRNA endometrial cell , concentration IL-6 IL-8 culture medium do real time RT-PCR ELISA respectively . The expression different cytokine endometrial cell response progestin might elucidate experiment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eutopic endometrium obtain separate single endometrial stromal cell ( ESC ) woman adenomyosis ( study group ) without adenomyosis ( control group ) . After become pre-confluent ( cover 80 % culture well ) , ESC culture 8 day solely addition medroxyprogesterone ( MPA ) danazol . ELISA do measure IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-alpha concentration culture medium . Real-time quantitative RT-PCR do measure IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-alpha RNA level ESC .</detailed_description>
