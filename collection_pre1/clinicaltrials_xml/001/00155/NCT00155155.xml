	<brief_summary>Taiwan hyperendemic area hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection . Previous study demonstrate vigorous T cell responses HBV-encoded antigen develop patient self-limited acute hepatitis B . In contrast , weak T cell response could detect chronic hepatitis B ( CH-B ) patient . However , immune response still well know patient acute exacerbation ( AE ) CH-B patient advance liver disease , liver cirrhosis ( LC ) hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell might suppress immune response foreign antigen pathogen . The role CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell patient chronically infect HBV remain clarified . The high percentage HBV carrier Taiwan relate vertical transmission . High maternal HBV viral load may make newborn tolerant HBV . However , HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses cord blood newborn still unknown . Thus , want resolve issue study . We enroll HBsAg ( + ) patient NTUH . Blood sample collect . We analyze HBV-specific CD8+ T cell response clarify role regulatory T cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studies Immune Responses Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HBsAg ( + ) patient National Taiwan University Hospital include . Screening HLA haplotype perform amplification refractory mutation system / PCR method . The HLA-A2 HLA-A11 enrol study group two haplotype one Taiwan . The HLA haplotype HBV carrier enrol HLA-mismatch control . The disease spectra include inactive HBV carrier , CH-B , CH-B AE ( define ALT &gt; = 5 X UNL ) , HBV-related LC , HBV-related HCCs . HBsAg , anti-HBs , IgM anti-HBc , HBeAg , anti-HBe , anti-HCV , anti-HDV , anti-HIV determine commercial enzyme immunoassay kit . The serum level HBV DNA genotypes do quantitative real-time PCR . Patients also infect HDV HCV HIV exclude . PBMCs isolate heparinized blood sample density gradient centrifugation Ficoll-Hypaque . The PBMC wash phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) resuspend T cell medium . Analysis HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses do flow cytometry use pentamer staining . To analyze HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses patient chronic HBV infection ( prospective study ) . This part study clarify role HBV-specific T cell response course acute exacerbation CH-B . Blood collect four important time point .</detailed_description>
