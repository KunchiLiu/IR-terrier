	<brief_summary>Based universal eradication H. pylorus offshore island ( Matsu ) high prevalence gastric cancer well premalignant gastric lesion , first examine infection rate H. pylorus . Secondly , evaluate efficacy clarithromycin-based triple therapy levofloxacin-based rescue treatment . And thirdly , test hypothesis whether cure H. pylori reverse premalignant gastric lesion . Fourth , determine cost-effectiveness intervention . The gene-environment interaction address regard gastric cancer carcinogenesis . Finally , incident rate gastric cancer would follow cohort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite decline global incidence , gastric cancer still affect public health substantially due considerable medical burden treatment disease symptomatic stage . This fact prompt clinician extend attention multidisciplinary therapy design preventive strategy . Gastric cancer development follow carcinogenic process non-atrophic gastritis , atrophic gastritis , intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia , eventually adenocarcinoma . Helicobacter pylorus ( H. pylorus ) infection trigger carcinogenic cascade eradication currently reliable regimen arrest histologic progression order prevent gastric cancer . Emerging data suggest benefit H. pylorus treatment earlier course infection large outweigh disfavored discount rate result different time horizon early treatment later benefit avert advanced cancer . In Asia-Pacific area , however , virulent strain H. pylori infection highly prevalent premalignant gastric lesion may already develop take-off age active intervention . Our current knowledge remain limited answer whether H. pylorus eradication regress premalignant lesion , determinant contribute positive response unknown . The concept `` point return '' suggest benefit H. pylori eradication may diminish late stage many type molecular damage become irreversible . Several population-based study , contrast , find premalignant gastric lesion potentially reversible give sufficiently long duration free infection . The inconsistence may reflect fact study adequate sample size long enough follow-up rarely available important factor , variation host susceptibility disease dietary exposure carcinogen , difficult measure likely confound result . Therefore , present study : 1 . Determine efficacy novel regimen treat H. pylorus infection general population . 2 . To address question whether premalignant gastric lesion could reverse follow cure infection . 3 . To simulate cost-effectiveness chemoprevention . 4 . To use individual data empirically calculate cost-effectiveness intervention . 5 . To address host genetic susceptibility gastric cancer development . 6 . To follow-up gastric cancer incidence follow eradication H. pylorus .</detailed_description>
