	<brief_title>SERPIN D1 Its Role Lung Cancer Invasion Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death Taiwan world wild . Although progresses diagnosis treatment lung cancer , incidence mortality rate lung cancer increase recent year . In many case , lung cancer diagnose treated cancer cell already invade surround tissue metastasize throughout body . Only 15 % lung cancer patient operable presentation half long term survival . The remain almost die metastatic disease . Detecting lung cancer earliest stage , identify cancer metastatic potential high probability truly cure disease . Molecules express uniquely high level tumor cell comparison normal tissue may secrete accessible fluid blood , urine , sputum may useful lung cancer biomarkers . By use tools SAGE Genie Cancer Genome Anatomy Project ( CGAP ) , identify secreted protein , SERPIN D1 , overexpressed gene non-small cell lung cancer compare normal lung normal tissue . In establish panel human lung adenocarcinoma cell line different invasive activity ( CL1–0 cell sublines CL1–1 , CL1–5 , ascend order activity ) , detect expression SERPIN D1 high CL1-5 CL1-0 CL1-1 . According preliminary result , hypothesize SERPIN D1 may play role lung cancer invasion metastasis may serve serum biomarker prognosis stratification . For study , go evaluate potential correlation SERPIN D1 expression clinical specimen ( include surgical specimen blood sample ) lung cancer metastasis .</detailed_description>
