	<brief_title>Establish Epidemiologic Data H. Pylori Infection Children Adolescents-Using C13-UBT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylorus ( H. pylorus ) , spiral microaerophilic Gram-negative bacterium isolated 1983 , know common gastrointestinal bacterial infection worldwide . It principal cause chronic gastritis strongly associate peptic ulcer disease well gastric cancer , include gastric lymphoma ( MALT type ) . In developed country , infection occur 50 % adult , whereas develop country infection rate reach 90 % . Among H. pylorus infection , eradication therapy alters natural history recurrence attendant morbidity death , previously require lifelong maintenance therapy . Perhaps great concern regard infection H. pylorus increase risk development gastric cancer adulthood . This particularly relevant infection date childhood appear enhance risk carcinogenesis . Because H. pylorus infection contract primarily childhood year , additional epidemiological study among pediatric population imperative . Therefore validation inexpensive , easy-to perform , sensitive , specific , noninvasive diagnostic test H. pylorus infection child adolescent paramount importance enhance presently limit understanding H. pylori-related disease . The optimal noninvasive test epidemiological research H. pylori infection child still well identify . Serologic immunoassay base H. pylori antigen require validation pediatric population evaluation . As result previous study , serological test sensitive enough epidemiology screen tool H. pylori infection children.The aim prospective study : ( 1 ) prospectively investigate `` true '' prevalence rate , acquisition spontaneous clearance H. pylorus infection year year population whose age seven fifteen . ( 2 ) explore risk factor transmission H. pylori infection Taiwan . ( This information may use guide conduction national policy public health disease prevention . ) The study population include student one primary school one junior high school Lo-Tong area . There 150-160 case age group continuously followed-up 3 year . Blood sample collect student serological test . 13C-urea breath test perform student , . The parent student answer questionnaire concern basic epidemiological data possible factor related transmission H. pylorus . The student new acquisition H. pylori infection 2nd 3rd year ' follow-up period collect investigation . These student family invite receive panendoscopy evaluation possible pathology stomach isolation H. pylorus strain . These H. pylorus isolates identify molecular genotyping detection possible source transmission family . All result analyze SAS system .</detailed_description>
