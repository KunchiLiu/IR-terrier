	<detailed_description>Incidence Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer first mortality rate gynecologic malignancy ( 1-3 ) become important disease recent year ( 4-6 ) . The incidence ovarian cancer also increase recent year Taiwan ( 7 ) . Ovarian cancer high mortality gynecological cancer , overall 5-year survival rate 20â€“30 % ( 1 ) . The lack symptom , difficulty early diagnosis , insufficient accurate tumor marker , lack information ovarian tumor biology contribute poor prognosis ovarian cancer patient ( 8 ) . The prognostic parameter ovarian carcinomas tumor stage , histologic subtype , degree malignancy , residual tumor surgical treatment ( 9-12 ) . However , factor present incomplete picture tumor biology ovarian cancer frequently interrelate ( 13 ) . Thus , identification new biologic factor predictive individual disease course prognosis would extremely useful . From above-mentioned data , ovarian cancer indeed disease respect , however , research work focus Taiwan . Tumor marker ovarian cancer Detection tumor marker release circulation aid diagnosis and/or monitor therapeutic response patient various tumor , include carcinoma ovary ( 14-17 ) , prostate ( 18 ) , gastrointestinal tract ( 19 , 20 ) , breast ( 21 ) . CA125 commonly use serum marker patient ovarian carcinoma ( 14 ) . Although proven clinically valuable monitoring response patient therapy , ovarian carcinoma express CA125 , CA125 often increase patient inflammatory disease . Thus , need improvement , either form specific and/or sensitive assay assay us different marker use complement CA125 toward goal improve patient survival improve diagnosis . New potential molecule tumor marker ovarian cancer Mesothelin 40-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein . It synthesize precursor molecular mass 69 kDa , proteolytically process N terminal secrete form molecular mass 30 kDa membrane-bound form 40 kDa ( 22 , 23 ) . The 30-kDa secreted form term megakaryocyte potentiating factor ( 23 ) . In normal tissue , expression mesothelin subsequently show largely restrict mesothelial cell , although immunoreactivity also report epithelial cell trachea , tonsil , fallopian tube , kidney ( 24 ) . Mesothelin show express pancreatic carcinoma ( 25 ) , gastric carcinoma ( 26 ) ovarian carcinoma ( 27 ) , seem mesothelin may utilize tumor marker ovarian carcinoma . We evaluate amount mesothelin pre- post-treatment serum sample patient epithelial ovarian cancer . We also correlate clinicopathologic item prognosis ovarian cancer patient evaluate whether mesothelin new rumor marker ovarian cancer patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients ovarian carcinoma undergo hysterectomy , bilateral salpingooophorectomy , omentectomy , appendectomy enrol clinical data obtain hospital . All patient receive four six course adjuvant platinumcontaining chemotherapy.Histologic grade accord International Union Cancer criterion ( 28 ) . The stage disease classify accord International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ( FIGO , 1987 ) . Pelvic paraaortic lymph node sampling perform , disease confine within ovary without ruptured capsule . The histopathologic data , include histologic type histologic grade , evaluate certified pathologist . The maximal diameter residual tumor surgery also record . All patient follow 3month interval . Patients ovarian endometrioma , benign ovarian tumor receive surgical intervention , healthy patient without surgical intervention present normal control .</criteria>
