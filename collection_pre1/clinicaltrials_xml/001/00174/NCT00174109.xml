	<detailed_description>Betel quid chew show intimate correlation oral cancer . In Taiwan , incidence oral cancer fourth common malignancy male fact , 90 % link betel quid chewing . The predisposing factor oral cancer western country India , Southeast Asia include Taiwan different . The factor smoke former country betel quid chew important one latter group . The genetic aberration oral cancer different western country India , Southeast Asia include Taiwan . The percentage RAS mutation oral cancer western country around 5 % , 35 % India . In Taiwan , RAS mutation rate reveal immunohistochemical stain 92 % , compare western country ( 62 % ) , Japan ( 55-65 % ) vice versa p53 mutation . The percentage p53 mutation oral cancer western country around 50 % , 16 % India , Southeast Asia Taiwan . It generally believe betel nut , arecoline arecaidine , major betel alkaloid , account etiological factor pathogenesis oral cancer betel quid supplement , unlike former two main component , report little relevancy oral cancer . Despite fact cytotoxic genotoxic effect betel nut extract arecoline , arecaidine extensively document , well-studied oncogene tumor suppressor gene implicate betel quid-related oral cancer , molecular mechanism , address broad view , betel nut ingredient lead oral tumorigenesis fully understood . Our preliminary result , virtue different genome-wide screening approach explore cellular function protein kinase context , identify several candidate show differential expression upon treatment BQ primary culture human oral mucosa . Of candidate isolate , microtubule-associated protein 2 ( MAP2 ) , neuron-specific cytoskeletal protein think predominantly express rat brain cell , find up-regulated RNA level RT-PCR primary culture . Our expanded immunohistochemical result normal mucosa , leukoplakia oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) suggest expression MAP2 significantly correlate progression BQ-induced OSCC ( P = 0.0046 ) , since percentage MAP2 positive staining much fourfold BQ-exposed OSCC ( 41.2 % ) BQ-free OSCC ( 10.5 % ) , whereas normal mucosa leukoplakia show much less immunoreactivity whole . Furthermore , MAP2 show preferentially express histopathologically less differentiated OSCC ( P = 0.014 ) . Finally , show MAP2 highly express majority invasive OSCC ( 67 % ) . Consequently , find , conjunction previous one , raise possibility overexpression MAP2 may play critical role development highly malignant OSCC characteristic invasive and/or metastatic . Here study issue establish vitro system extract whole betel quid sandwich use treat head neck cancer cell line primary oral epithelial cell subsequently , effect treatment evaluate term cell migration , Western blotting . Eight head neck cancer cell line normal oral mucosa 8 patient undergoing oral surgery collect . Extracts whole betel quid sandwich concentration 1.5 mg/ml add cell line primary oral epithelial cell 1,3 5 day , respectively . Migration assay detection MAP2 expression perform elucidate relationship MAP2 cell migration .</detailed_description>
