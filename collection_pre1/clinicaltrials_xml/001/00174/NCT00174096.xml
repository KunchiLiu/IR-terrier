	<brief_title>The Role Stromal Cell-Derived Factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) /CXC Chemokine Receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) Metastasis Laryngeal Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer larynx hypopharynx remain third common head neck malignancy , constitute 20 % tumor . Squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) common histopathologic type laryngeal hypopharyngeal malignancy , account 90 % cancer occur region . Lymph node metastasis directly affect prognosis patient laryngeal hypopharyngeal SCC . The presence lymph node metastasis significantly reduce probability regional control survival . Furthermore , American Cancer Society show trend toward improvement 5-year survival rate patient diagnosed 1974 1976 1989 1995 . Tumor metastasis hallmark malignancy , probably result interaction tumor cell supportive microenvironment . Malignant cell capability metastasize particular organ may various property support tissue invasion growth enhance adherence microvascular cell organ , high responsiveness chemotactic signal release target organ increase response local soluble tissue associate growth signal target organ . Though several molecule express produced cancer cell consider metastatic factor , remain unknown factor produce lymph node tissue affect metastasis cancer cell . Chemokines large family pro-inflammatory polypeptide cytokine , consist small ( 7â€“15 kDa ) , structurally relate heparin-binding protein . They group CXC chemokines CC chemokines , basis characteristic presence four conserve cysteine residue . Chemokines produce locally tissue act target cell G-protein-coupled receptor , characterize structurally seven transmembrane span domain . Chemokines involve attraction activation mononuclear polymorphonuclear leukocyte sit inflammatory response , bacterial viral infection , allergy , cardiovascular disease wound heal . Chemokines know also function regulatory molecule leukocyte maturation , trafficking , home T B lymphocytes , development lymphoid tissue , dendritic cell maturation . Other function chemokines describe recently , particularly CXC chemokines . The role chemokines malignant tumor clear yet . Some chemokines may enhance innate specific host immunity tumor dissemination . On hand , may advocate tumor growth metastasis promote tumor cell proliferation , migration angiogenesis tumor tissue . Reports suggest several type cancer , breast , ovary , prostate , kidney , brain , lung , thyroid , express chemokine receptor use chemokines metastasize target organ home hematopoietic cell . SDF-1 belongs CXC chemokine family ligand CXCR4 . SDF-1 initially clone Tashiro et al . later identify growth factor B cell progenitor , chemotactic factor T cell monocytes , B-cell lymphopoiesis bone marrow myelopoiesis . Most chemokine receptor interact pleural ligand , vice versa , SDF-1/CXCR4 receptor ligand system show involve one-on-one interaction . Recently , several study conduct detect mRNA expression CXCR4 SDF-1 solid tumor . The result uniform , relevance cancer progression determine . Sehgal et al . conclude CXCR4 play important role proliferation tumorigenic property human glioblastoma tumor . Muller et al . report SDF-1 signaling CXCR4 interaction appear determine directional migration breast cancer cell basement membrane . Furthermore vivo , interaction SDF-1 CXCR4 significantly repress metastatic potential breast cancer cell lymph node lung . Barnard colleague show contrary result CXCR4 mRNA expression reduce hepatocellular carcinoma tissue compare noncancerous tissue , change colon , esophageal , gastric cancer . They also find reduce mRNA expression SDF-1 malignant tissue . Thus , diversity view role SDF-1/CXCR4 receptor ligand system malignant tissue . And study limit laryngeal hypopharyngeal cancer . Metastasis laryngeal hypopharyngeal cancer occur frequently lymphatic system , metastasis key prognostic factor disease . Evaluation relationship SDF-1/CXCR4 system metastasis laryngeal hypopharyngeal cancer could help u understand whether system important metastasis disease . We hypothesize SDF-1/CXCR4 ( ligand/receptor ) system play important role laryngeal hypopharyngeal cancer metastasis . To test hypothesis , investigate : 1. distribution CXCR4 protein expression cancer lymph node tissue mean immunohistochemical analysis tissue sample obtain surgical operation 2. relationship CXCR4 expression clinicopathological finding special reference cancer metastasis 3. expression SDF-1 CXCR4 cancer cell line cell tissue 4. chemotactic activity growth-promoting effect SDF-1 cancer cell line cell 5. role Src , MAPK , Akt signal transduction pathway response 6. effect block agent response . Undoubtedly , finding study help u understand whether SDF-1/CXCR4 system could focal point anti-cancer research . If laryngeal hypopharyngeal SCC express high level CXCR4 show consistently high incidence lymphatic distant metastasis , block SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling may novel approach inhibit metastasis patient . The development SDF-1/CXCR4 system antagonist provide opportunity improve survival rate .</detailed_description>
