	<detailed_description>The exact mechanism pathogenesis Graves ’ ophthalmopathy ( GO ) still unknown . Histopathologically , extraocular muscle inflammation due lymphoid infiltration , edema interstitial fibrosis , increase glycosaminoglycan deposition orbital fat inflammation two prominent change . There various manifestation include ocular adnexal tissue inflammation , proptosis , lid retraction , extraocular movement limitation compressive optic neuropathy . In past year , investigate morphological feature Müller muscle patient thyroid lid retraction use special stain immunohistochemistry formalin-fixed paraffin-embbeded ( FFPE ) section . In finding , smooth muscle cell , diseased group , replace variable adipose fibrosis tissue . Two distinct feature disease group seem notable investigation . In recent year , TSHR , putative autoantigen , verify express orbital connective tissue extra-ocular muscle . In addition , demonstrate express surface culture orbital fibroblast orbital adipose tissue , patient GO several laboratory . From functional study increase adipogenesis cultured fibroblast expression TSHR protein , role target effector cell orbital fibroblast validated7 . We use immunohistochemistry verify existence TSHR fibroblast within Müller muscle , positive staining manifest only18 % patient . It may due less extent expression end stage . We curious know difference expression TSHR orbital specimen patient acute stable stage . Quantitative RT-PCR may help differentiate whether less extent expression end stage low protein amount detect . In recent year , diverse phenotype orbital fibroblast , regard expression Thy-1 protein , report several study , investigator believe heterogeneity orbital fibroblast may determine clinical presentation Graves ’ ophthalmopathy . We also curious know phenotypic heterogeneity fibroblasts ocular adnexal orbital tissue correlate distinct morphological feature adipogenesis fibrosis . In addition , systemic local pro-inflammatory cytokine may contribute turn turn expression different role fibroblast . Moreover , increase CD40 expression skin fibroblast note patient systemic sclerosis . Expression IGF-I IGF-IR seem up-regulated process several fibrotic disease . A nuclear transcription factor , PPAR-γ , verify close relationship adipogenesis . In previous study , smooth muscle cell , diseased Mullers ’ muscle , replace variable adipose fibrosis tissue . The increase adipose fibrosis tissue ex vivo Müller ’ muscle may result over-action biochemical marker fibroblast infiltrate around muscle cell . We hypothesize immunological process involve ocular adnexal orbital tissue , result various ophthalmological manifestation . The purpose study investigate different stage ( acute stable stage ) ocular adnexal orbital tissue ( include orbital fat , extraocular muscle , orbicularis muscle eyelid fat ) identify validate pathogenesis Graves ophthalmopathy frozen section ocular adnexal orbital tissue Immunohistochemistry ( IHA ) ( Thy-1 PPARγ ) , mRNA expression TSH receptor , PPAR-γ , IGF-1R , IGF-1 different cytokine ( IL-1β , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-8 ) use quantitative RT-PCR flow cytometry acute stable stage GO .</detailed_description>
