	<brief_summary>Brain damage result decrease oxygen brain find 80 % patient die severe head injury . Laboratory study animals clinical trial show increase oxygen brain result well brain oxygen consumption , less cell death , good functional outcome . This study test hypothesis Oxycyte effective way increase brain oxygen level severe head injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Oxycyte Severe Closed Head Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decreased brain oxygen severe brain injury appear implicated poor functional outcome death . Animal clinical study show increase brain oxygen patient improve functional outcome , Oxycyte show effective mean deliver oxygen tissue , include brain . This study eight patient proof concept study test effect oxygen delivery Oxycyte patient severe traumatic head injury Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) score 3 9 . Subjects diagnose severe head injury ( GCS 3-9 ) receive brain oxygen monitor microdialysis catheter , undergo baseline monitoring 4 hour . In first 4 subject Fi02 ventilator increase 50 % 4 hour stabilization period follow single intravenous infusion 3ml/kg Oxycyte . The Fi02 remain 50 % 24 hour . In second 4 subject Fi02 ventilator increase 100 % 4 hour stabilization period follow single intravenous infusion 3ml/kg Oxycyte . The Fi02 remain 100 % 24 hour . Subjects enrol , treat , monitor LICOX 02 monitor infusion PFC , least 48 hour follow discontinuation Oxycyte .</detailed_description>
