	<brief_title>Efficacy Pioglitazone Macrovascular Outcome Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus one common non-communicable disease worldwide . More 22 million person diagnose diabetes European region International Diabetes Federation . Complications diabetes involve microvascular macrovascular system contribute increased disability reduce life expectancy . Damage coronary , cerebral ( brain ) , peripheral vascular bed consequence diabetes responsible increase macrovascular illness death associate disease . Insulin resistance common genesis atherosclerosis type 2 diabetes mellitus . In diabetes , insulin resistance couple receptor dysfunction . In atherosclerosis , insulin resistance may direct effect cardiovascular system well indirect effect provoke imbalance blood glucose , lipid , clot factor , endothelial function , factor . Considerable indirect evidence suggest peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist may favorably influence macrovascular outcome , either modification risk factor ( blood lipid ) effect vessel wall . Pioglitazone , thiazolidinedione compound discover Takeda Pharmaceutical Company , Ltd , function peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist mode action . This study design ass whether pioglitazone combination medication administer glycemic management type 2 diabetes might reduce incidence macrovascular event associate disease compare placebo . Individuals participate study provide write informed consent require commit screen randomization visit approximately 17 additional visit ( 1 every 2 month first year every 3 month thereafter ) study center . Study participation anticipate 40 month ( approximately 3 year 4 month ) . Multiple procedure occur visit may include fasting , blood collection , physical examination electrocardiograms .</detailed_description>
