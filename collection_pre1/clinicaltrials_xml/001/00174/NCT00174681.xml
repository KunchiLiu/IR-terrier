	<brief_summary>Primary objective : The primary objective trial : - To evaluate efficacy initiate Lantus combination oral antidiabetic drug compare oral antidiabetic treatment optimise enhance hygienic dietary measure type 2 diabetic whose blood glucose control acceptable optimal maximum oral treatment , base number patient achieve HbA1c value &lt; 7 % end treatment . Secondary objective : The secondary objective trial compare two treatment group : - The variation HbA1c baseline end trial . - The frequency episodes symptomatic hypoglycaemia ( diurnal nocturnal ) , severe hypoglycaemia ( diurnal nocturnal ) asymptomatic hypoglycaemia . - Mean blood glucose level different time day . - The variation weight lipid group baseline end trial . - The incidence adverse event .</brief_summary>
