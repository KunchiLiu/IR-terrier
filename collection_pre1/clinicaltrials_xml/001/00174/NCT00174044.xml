	<brief_title>Control Strategies Locomotor System During Obstacle-Crossing Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A stroke ( cerebrovascular accident ) neurological deficit last beyond 24 hour . It disruption blood supply region brain cause neurological impairment . According 2003 statistical data National Health Administration executive organ Taiwan , stroke consider second common cause death cancer . According research stroke incidence Taiwan , incidence 0.3 % population 35 years-old , incidence increase sharply 3 % population 65 years-old nearly 294 1806 people . From , know stroke one common neural disease old population . Strokes classify ischemic hemorrhagic . Approximately 70-80 % stroke ischemic stroke , include cerebrovascular thrombosis embolism . The 10-15 % either intracerebral hemorrhage subarachnoid hemorrhage stroke . Distinctive neurological sign reflect region brain involve . The type severity neurological deficit cover wide range gradation symptom . Cerebrovascular accident frequently cause upper motor neuron syndrome ( Change muscle tension , unilateral hemiplegia , movement un-coordination , un-reciprocal movement , poor movement control , etc . ) , sensory deficit , aphasia , cognitive behavior problem , etc . These deficit often leave dependence movement function daily life . Previous study show 10 % stroke resume work , 40 % slight disability , 40 % server disability 10 % live medical organization forever . Moderate server disability evaluate easily use different kind outcome measure determinate status neurological injury result disability , provide guideline aggressive treatment rehabilitation . However , good outcome function independently daily life may show stroke mild disability outcome measure . It clear nearly normal stroke really normal group without stroke , even normal status show stroke outcome measure . It unknown motor control strategies stroke function independently daily life similar normal group indeed . A recent study find 73 % subject stroke fell least 6 month discharge hospital ; , 10 % report fall obstacle . Falling may cause impairment stroke different motor control strategy stroke mild disability . In addition , trip obstacle one common movement daily life frequently mention cause fall elderly ( Lu,2005 ) . Crossing obstacle successfully safely depend stability stance leg maintain good clearance obstacle . Indeed , cross obstacle complex motor skill walk , ensure sufficient clearance obstacle locomotion require accurate movement appropriate modification swing limb . Therefore , obstacle cross one exercise program diminishing disability rehabilitation . Studies obstacle cross young old adult much attention . However , little known obstacle cross deficit follow stroke , especially good outcome function independently stroke . It still mystery motor control motor plastic central nerve system . Otherwise , knowledge motor control strategy stroke obstacle-crossing helpful design fall-prevention device plan program prevention associate injury . The purpose study observe quantify certain characteristic performance subject follow stroke good outcome understand damage central nerve system affect motor control . The present study investigate select spatial-temporal characteristic , kinematic variable kinetic variable gait pattern define problem obstacle cross follow stroke . To quantify deficit , compare result group subject stroke group healthy subject match age , gender , height .</detailed_description>
