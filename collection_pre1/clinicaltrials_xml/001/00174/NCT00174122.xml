	<brief_summary>Nowadays , physician play important role manage patient potential infectious complication emergency room . Previous study demonstrate importance early adequate anti-microbial therapy reduce mortality morbidity patient severe sepsis . However , one study , 6 % clinically significant bacteremic patient misdiagnosed discharged emergency room . In study , 8.5 approximately 17 % empirical antibiotic selection judge inappropriately accord subsequent microbiology , anti-microbial susceptibility result . It reflect diversity presentation infectious disease limit available microbiological report first-line emergency physician . Timely diagnosis selection appropriate antibiotics/treatment treat patient challenge emergency physician ever . A serum marker , procalcitonin , recently demonstrate potential indicator distinguish non-infectious infectious acute inflammatory reaction , viral bacterial infection , non-bacteremic bacteremic infection . It also demonstrate association high-mortality risk patient severe sepsis . However , area remain inconclusive clinical application potential serum marker . The investigator design prospective study follow purpose : 1 . To clarify sensitivity specificity serum procalcitonin quantitative test clinical indicator sepsis ; 2 . To identify cut-off value serum procalcitonin level sepsis screen among various group patient different co-morbidities ; 3 . To test potential role procalcitonin quantitative test identify occult sepsis patient acute undifferentiated febrile reaction emergency room ; 4 . To test possibility sequential procalcitonin quantitative test serological guide appropriateness empirical antibiotic microbiology result available . Conclusions investigator ' study clarify clinical application serum procalcitonin quantitative test differential diagnosis patient systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome , screen high-risk sepsis patient , effectiveness empirical antibiotic evaluation .</brief_summary>
