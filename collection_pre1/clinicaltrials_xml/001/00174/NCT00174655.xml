	<criteria>Histologically prove breast cancer . Interval definitive surgery include axillary lymph node dissection registration must less 60 day . A representative sample primary tumor ( either block slide ) must send operational office , central pathology review , patient randomization . Definitive surgical treatment must either mastectomy breast conserving surgery , axillary lymph node dissection ( sample ) operable breast cancer ( clinical T13 , N01 , M0 ) . Margins resect specimen definitive surgery must histologically free invasive adenocarcinoma ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) . Lobular carcinoma insitu count positive margin . Patients histologicallydocumented infiltration skin ( pT4 ) eligible . Patients breast conserving procedure positive margin may become eligible subsequently undergo adequate resection mastectomy clear margin . Histologic examination tumor : invasive adenocarcinoma least one axillary lymph node ( pN1 ) show evidence tumor among minimum eight resect lymph node . All node must examine pathologist . The determination ER ( estrogen receptor ) PgR ( progesterone receptor ) mandatory result must know end chemotherapy order decide whether hormonal therapy indicate ( Biochemical immunohistochemical method require ; ER and/or PgR positivity accordance policy use participate center . Each center specify policy ) . Age &gt; = 18 year age &lt; = 70 year . The upper age limit mean exclusionary rather base lack safety data woman &gt; 70 year age . Karnofsky Performance status index &gt; = 70 % . Normal cardiac function must confirm LVEF ( MUGA scan echocardiography ) . The result must lower limit normal institution . Laboratory requirement : ( within 14 day prior registration ) Hematology Neutrophils &gt; = 2.0 x 109/L Platelets &gt; =100 x 109/L Hemoglobin &gt; = 10 g/dL Hepatic function Total bilirubin &lt; = 1 UNL ASAT ( SGOT ) ALAT ( SGPT ) &lt; = 1.5 UNL Alkaline phosphatase &lt; = 2.5 UNL Renal function Creatinine &lt; = 150 µmol/L ( 1.5 mg/dL ) If creatinine borderline , calculate creatinine clearance &gt; = 60 mL/min ( Cockcroft formula ) . Complete stag workup within 3 month prior registration . All patient bilateral mammography , chest Xray ( PA lateral ) and/or CTscan , abdominal ultrasound and/or CT scan , bone scan ( case positive bone scan suspicious metastasis , bone Xray ( bone CTscan spine ) hot spot mandatory rule possibility metastatic hot spot ) . Other test may perform clinically indicate . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate center could Principal coinvestigator 's site . In case patient move followup , every effort do follow patient participate center . Negative pregnancy test ( urine serum ) within 7 day prior registration woman childbearing potential . Patients childbearing potential must implement adequate nonhormonal measure avoid pregnancy study treatment ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy hormonal therapy ) . Prior systemic anticancer therapy breast cancer ( chemoimmunohormonotherapy ) . Prior radiation therapy breast cancer . Pregnant , lactate patient . Any locally advance ( clinical pathological T4 and/or N2known N3 ) metastatic ( M1 ) breast cancer.Patients inoperable residual axillary nodal disease supraclavicular node . Preexisting motor sensory neurotoxicity severity ³ grade 2 NCI criterion . Other serious illness medical condition : congestive heart failure unstable angina pectoris , previous history myocardial infarction within 1 year study entry , uncontrolled hypertension highrisk uncontrolled arrhythmias history significant neurologic psychiatric disorder include psychotic disorder , dementia seizure would prohibit understanding give informed consent active uncontrolled infection active peptic ulcer , unstable diabetes mellitus Past current history neoplasms except : curatively treat basal cell skin cancer adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix In regard past current history breast carcinoma , criteria exclusion : past history ipsilateral past current history contralateral invasive breast carcinoma past current history contralateral ductal situ breast carcinoma A past current history ipsilateral ductal situ lobular situ ( ipsilateral contralateral ) breast carcinoma criterion exclusion . Chronic treatment corticosteroid unless initiate &gt; 6 month prior study entry low dose ( &lt; = 20 mg methylprednisolone equivalent ) . Concurrent treatment hormonal replacement therapy . Prior treatment stop study entry . Definite contraindication use corticosteroid . Concurrent treatment experimental drug . Participation another clinical trial investigational market drug within 30 day prior study entry . Concurrent treatment anticancer therapy . The information intend contain consideration relevant patient 's potential participation clinical trial .</criteria>
