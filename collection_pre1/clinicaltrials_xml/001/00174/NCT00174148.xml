	<detailed_description>The purpose research investigate effect age chronic neck pain cervical proprioception , change ultrasonographic ( USD ) pattern deep neck muscle superficial neck muscle . The hypothesis research include : 1 ) alteration neck proprioception determine predominantly change activation deep neck muscle superficial neck muscle . 2 ) Age factor contribute alteration cervicocephalic sensibility , USD pattern deep superficial muscle . 3 ) Chronic pain contributes alteration cervicocephalic sensibility , USD pattern deep superficial muscle . Neck proprioception measure ultrasound-based coordinate measuring system ( CMS 70P , Zebris , Germany ) ask subject perform head reposition neutral head position target position three cardinal plane . These reposition error express root mean square error could represent craniocervical kinesthetic sensibility . The change muscle thickness ( mm ) superficial ( Trapezium , Splenius ) deep ( semispinalis cervicis multifidus ) dorsal neck muscle measure real-time ultrasonographic scanner ( HDI 5000 , ATL Ultrasound , USA ) . Image obtain cervical level , thickness muscle identify manually use custom-written C++ computer graphic program . The measurement pain intensity pain frequency modify symptom questionnaire indicate intensity , location , frequency duration pain disability subject . The age pain effect independent variable measure patient chronic neck pain ( pain : intensity , location , frequency , duration , NDI ) , test General Linear Model ( GLM ; age pain factor ) . The confound factor gender , range motion , body height weight control regression model .</detailed_description>
