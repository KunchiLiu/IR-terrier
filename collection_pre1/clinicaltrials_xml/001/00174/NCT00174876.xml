A typical psychiatric approach recent add one new anti-schizophrenia medication exist FDA approve antidepressant order achieve good serotonin level depress patient 's brain . This optimization brain serotonin help alleviate depressive symptom . The new antipsychotic medication FDA approve Aripiprazole ( Abilify ) . It may particularly effective may safely elevate sertotonin receptor 1a stimulation , receptor 2a blockade . It may also facilitate low level dopamine transmission truly novel agent compare schizophrenia drug . Depressed patient also tend lack dopamine brain . This make Aripiprazole ideal agent boost serotonin dopamine simultaneously . In theory , may effective way alleviate depressive symptom . The author suggest enroll 10 subject initially open label fashion take Aripiprazole plus current FDA approve antidepressant see elimination depressive symptom occur show pharmacological approach tolerable combination medication . If major safety issue , amendment allow 10 additional subject forward provide good tolerability sample size .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label study examine clinical utility safety add atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole augment agent antidepressant therapy treatment-resistant depressed patient . The author 's priori hypothesis aripiprazole plus current FDA approve antidepressant result significant reduction depressive symptom 6 week . Responders ( &gt; 50 % improvement baseline HAM-D score ) ask voluntarily continue 6 week open-label extension order show antidepressant effect aripiprazole longstanding nature . After screen consent liaison primary prescriber , 10 eligible subject receive aripiprazole 10-30 mg per day augmentation agent combination current FDA approve antidepressant medication . The dose subject 's original antidepressant remain unchanged study unless subject note intolerable newly emergent antidepressant-related side effect . Based tolerability response , aripiprazole start 5 mg per day augment follow ( baseline , end week 1 , end week 2 , end week 4 , termination visit end week 6 ) 5 mg per day increment , maximum dose 30 mg per day patient take antidepressant pre-existing significant inhibitory effect CYP450 2D6 enzyme system . However , patient take antidepressant significant CYP450 2D6 enzyme inhibitory property , may affect metabolism aripiprazole ( e.g . paroxetine , fluoxetine ) , maximum dose 15 mg per day ( 50 % less maximum recommend dose ) . These dose range choose capture mean effective dose ameliorate depressive symptom schizophrenia . The dose titrate upward downward base clinical response . Other psychotropic medication permit study deem necessary control side effect ( hypnotic , anxiolytic , antimuscarinics , beta blocker , etc. ) . Subjects stable dose hypnotic anxiolytic ( GABA Histamine-based ) least 4 week prior study entry may opt continue current dose wash prior study start . Aripiprazole dispense biweekly participant follow 6-weeks . Participants monitor every week HAMD ( blind ) , CGI , SAFTEE . Vital sign weight also take visit . After 6 week , two-week taper aripiprazole ( 50 % reduction dose per week ) . Compliance measure pill count All subject voluntarily offer stay study additional six week meet one final time end week 12 re-evaluate safety effectiveness long term aripiprazole augmentation . Subjects would go two week taper . Subjects wish continue additional six week may opt study original 6 week termination mark . If interim safety analysis ( independent psychiatrist TBD ) suggest good safety profile amendment send IRB ask 10 additional subject enrol . Primary secondary measure safety evaluation : The primary measure study change HAMD score time ( monitor make sure depression score worsen aripiprazole ) ; secondary efficacy measure change CGI score time . Safety evaluation determine SAFTEE rating scale patient AE report . An Expectancy Scale give determine subject ' level perceive confidence drug correlate outcomes note . This superficial way look placebo-like rate placebo use study .</detailed_description>
