	<brief_title>A Trial With Dronedarone Prevent Hospitalization Death Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multinational , double-blind , randomize , multi-center , placebo-controlled , parallel-group trial evaluate effect dronedarone versus placebo ( ratio 1:1 ) minimum treatment duration 12 month mean follow-up duration 1.75 year ( AF/AFL patient ) . Patients include study atrial fibrillation/flutter sinus rhythm conversion occur either spontaneously following procedure electrical cardioversion ( overdrive pacing ) administration antiarrhythmic drug.After randomization patient follow common study end date ; last patient include study follow 1 year . Visits baseline , 7 day , 14 day , one month , three month every three month end study . At visit patient ask occurrence hospitalization event since last visit . The study monitor independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) safety , tolerability efficacy .</detailed_description>
