	<brief_title>Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Combination With A-HAM Refractory AML ( GO-A-HAM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary refractory AML associate extremely poor prognosis [ 1,2 ] . In AMLHD93 trial conduct AMLSG ULM , patient refractory first induction therapy ICE ( idarubicin , cytarabine , etoposide ) overall survival 12 % 5 year [ 1 ] . All patient alive cohort receive allogeneic transplantation . Therefore , assign allogeneic transplantation consecutive trial , AMLHD98A , primary refractory patient [ 3 ] . However , main problem patient group remain achieve partial ( PR ) complete ( CR ) remission salvage therapy . Additionally , pre-transplant disease status important prognostic factor study allogeneic transplantation , regardless dose intensify dose reduce conditioning regimen use [ 4,5,6 ] . Since 1993 , study German-Austrian-AMLSG response-adapted treatment strategy use . Within AMLHD93 trial , refractory patient assign intensified second induction regimen S-HAM ( age &lt; 55 year ) [ 7 ] HAM ( age 55 60 year ) [ 1 ] , AMLHD98A trial , A-HAM [ 3 ] . The incorporation all-trans-retinoic acid base vitro data [ 8-13 ] randomise AMLHD98B study elderly AML-patients show benefit primary response survival patient assigned standard induction therapy combination ATRA [ 14 ] . To compare different salvage therapy strategy , perform as-treated analysis primary refractory patient different cohort . Although refractory first induction therapy ICE , nine patient received second cycle ICE . The result summarize table 1 show improve response rate ( CR PR ) patient treat A-HAM protocol thus lead high proportion patient receive allogeneic transplantation . Survival analysis show far difference 4 different group . Gemtuzumab ozogamicin ( GO ) humanize anti-CD33 conjugated Calicheamicin . The efficacy toxicity profile evaluate several study , far substance approve monotherapy relapse AML-patients dose 9mg/m² q 14d [ 15 ] . However , use single agent efficacy limit durable . Therefore , several trial evaluate GO combination conventional chemotherapy [ 16,17 ] . In MRC study dose 6 mg/m² give day 1 associate increase liver toxicity therefore study continue dose 3 mg/m² day 1 induction therapy [ 17 ] . In summary , available data combination therapy show efficacy GO phase II trial . The dose limiting toxicity define MRC trial 6 mg/m² . Therefore consider GO combination A-HAM primary refractory adult AML patient . Because primary refractory patient candidate allogeneic transplantation special consideration take respect development VOD allogeneic transplantation . One recent report suggest substantial risk VOD patient receive allogeneic transplantation therapy GO [ 18 ] . In report odds ratio VOD therapy GO within 3.5 month allogeneic transplantation 21.6 ( 95 % -confidence interval 4.2-112.2 % ) . However , report base 62 patient dosage GO use 6mg/m² 9mg/m² . Therefore , hold mind risk VOD GO exposure extremely poor prognosis primary refractory patient treatment approach combine A-HAM GO dose 3mg/m² justified .</detailed_description>
