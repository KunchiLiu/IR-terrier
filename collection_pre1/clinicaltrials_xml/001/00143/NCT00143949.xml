	<brief_summary>To determine renin angiotensin medication prevent delay onset diabetic kidney disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renin Angiotensin System Study ( RASS/B-RASS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective research determine , type 1 ( insulin-dependent ) diabetic patient without hypertension , diabetic nephropathy ( DN ) , level microalbuminuria ( MA ) predictive underlying , already establish serious lesion diabetic nephropathy , inhibition renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) activity prevent retard rate development histologic lesion associate DN . This primary prevention study design examine effect pharmacologic intervention early stage diabetic kidney disease . At stage overt DN intervention study show slow , opposed arrest , disease progression , benefit minority treat patient . At MA stage renal lesion DN already usually firmly establish ; moreover , progression MA patient may occur despite strict glycemic anti-hypertensive control . Renal histologic change time select primary endpoint order study early stage disease , since time functional endpoint earlier stage preclude practical study design . Specific Aim 1 To recruit 285 type 1 diabetic patient hypertension , diabetic nephropathy , predictive level microalbuminuria 5-year study determine effect inhibition renin-angiotensin system activity either losartan ( angiotensin II blocker ) enalapril ( convert enzyme inhibitor ) development diabetic renal disease . This aim accomplish study entitle Renin-Angiotension System Study ( RASS ) . Specific Aim 2 To obtain two percutaneous renal biopsy patient , first , entry study , second five year drug therapy either losartan enalapril . Hypothesis Reduction renin-angiotensin system activity prevent retard development histologic change kidney associate diabetic nephropathy . A secondary objective study evaluate retinal lesion RASS cohort patient order determine relationship finding histologic change DN examine effect RAS inhibition and/or systemic blood pressure ( BP ) development progression diabetic retinopathy . This ancillary study follow aim : Specific Aim To obtain baseline , 2.5 5 year retinal fundus photograph RASS patient . Hypothesis Cross-sectional longitudinal relationship retinal renal structural abnormality emerge improve predictive value renal functional test . Reduction rennin-angiotensin system activity prevent retard development diabetic retinal lesion</detailed_description>
