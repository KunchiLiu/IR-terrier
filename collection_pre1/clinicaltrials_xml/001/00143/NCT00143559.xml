	<brief_summary>Blood marrow stem cell transplant improve outcome patient high-risk hematologic malignancy . However , patient appropriate HLA ( immune type ) match sibling donor available and/or unable identify acceptable unrelated HLA match donor registry timely manner . Another option haploidentical transplant use partially match family member donor . Although haploidentical transplant proven curative many patient , procedure hinder significant complication , primarily regimen-related toxicity include GVHD infection due delay immune reconstitution . These , part , due certain white blood cell graft call T cell . GVHD happen donor T cell recognize body tissue patient ( host ) different attack cell . Although many T cell increase possibility GVHD , may cause recipient 's immune system reconstitute slowly graft fail grow , leave patient high-risk significant infection . For reason , primary focus researcher engineer graft provide T cell dose reduce risk GVHD , yet provide sufficient number cell facilitate immune reconstitution graft integrity . Building prior institutional trial , study provide patient haploidentical graft engineer specific T cell target value use CliniMACS system . A reduced intensity , preparative regimen use effort reduce regimen-related toxicity mortality . Two group patient enrol study . One group include high-risk hematologic malignancy second group include participant refractory hematologic malignancy undergo second transplant . The primary aim study estimate relapse rate one group research participants refractory hematologic malignancy undergo second allogeneic transplant . Both group follow analyzed separately regard secondary objective . This study close accrual April 2006 meet specific safety stopping rule regard occurrence severe graft vs. host disease . Although study longer open accrual , treat participant continue follow direct protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary outcome evaluation clinical study include following : - To estimate one-year overall survival research participant high risk malignancy receive haploidentical HSCT - To compare overall survival cumulative incidence relapse two group patient correspond historical control - To estimate disease-free survival event-free survival participant hematologic malignancy receive haploidentical HSCT - To estimate incidence overall grade 3-4 acute GvHD research participant hematologic malignancy receive haploidentical HSCT - To estimate incidence chronic GvHD graft failure research participant hematologic malignancy receive haploidentical HSCT - To estimate incidence non-hematologic regimen-related toxicity regimen-related mortality first 100 day post-transplant research participant hematologic malignancy receive haploidentical HSCT - To estimate number research participant develop evidence EBV reactivation post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLPD ) - To describe disease-free survival , GvHD engraftment research participant receive graft Killer immunoglobulin-like receptor ( KIR ) mismatch KIR match haploidentical donor</detailed_description>
