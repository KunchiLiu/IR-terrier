	<brief_summary>This Western Pennsylvania-based study ( 1 ) improve cardiovascular risk stratification identify high-risk population , ( 2 ) identify disparity cardiovascular risk base race , socioeconomic status , geographic location , ( 3 ) evaluate mechanism population difference cardiovascular risk , ( 4 ) implement multidisciplinary community-based intervention program decrease cardiovascular risk high-risk population . These goal , design eliminate ethnic racial health disparity , closely tied National Initiative Eliminate Racial Ethnic Disparities Health nation 's health promotion disease prevention agenda establish Healthy People 2010 . This prospective cohort study 2,000 resident state Pennsylvania approximately equal representation white African American subject . All participant undergo assessment traditional nontraditional risk factor identify determine mechanism population disparity cardiovascular risk . 800 participant intermediate high risk cardiovascular disease randomly assign either ( 1 ) usual care/ '' advice '' ; ( 2 ) multidisciplinary behavioral modification program determine effective approach reduce eliminate racial , socioeconomic geographic disparity cardiovascular risk . All participant undergo long-term follow-up cardiovascular event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Well-established disparity exist prevalence outcome cardiovascular disease relate race socioeconomic status ( SES ) . Our previous work confirms disparity suggests may relate population difference prevalence nontraditional cardiovascular risk factor . We propose disparity significantly reduce eliminate ( 1 ) community-based intervention program incorporate multidisciplinary education program lead behavioral interventionalist , nutritionist exercise physiologist , ( 2 ) novel approach cardiovascular risk stratification considers population difference traditional nontraditional risk factor subclinical atherosclerosis . To successfully implement program , particularly traditionally underserved community , formalize partnership University Pittsburgh School Medicine Graduate School Public Health , Pittsburgh Mind-Body Center , Pittsburgh Theological Seminary , Urban League Pittsburgh , Jewish Healthcare Foundation . This partnership position study follow specific aim : 1 . To determine whether community-based intervention program incorporate multidisciplinary education program lead behavioral interventionalist , nutritionist , exercise physiologist reduce racial socioeconomic disparity cardiovascular risk intermediate high risk population . 2 . To ascertain whether comprehensive assessment nontraditional risk factor subclinical atherosclerosis provide incremental value beyond traditional risk assessment identify individual high cardiovascular risk .</detailed_description>
