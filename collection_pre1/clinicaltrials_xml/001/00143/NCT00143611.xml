	<brief_title>Efficacy &amp; Safety Resatorvid Adults With Severe Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis , define sepsis associate acute organ dysfunction , remain serious medical problem worldwide . In United States alone , approximately 750,000 case severe sepsis occur year , mortality rate range 30 % 50 % severe sepsis patient concomitant organ dysfunction . As population age , number expect increase . The pathophysiology severe sepsis think involve activation variety inflammatory procoagulant host response infection , unchecked , lead diffuse endovascular injury , multi-organ dysfunction , ultimately death . The host response infection microorganism microorganism-derived molecule characterize synthesis release pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) interleukins 1 , 6 8 ( IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 ) , inflammatory cell , marker inflammation C-reactive protein . Inflammatory cell , macrophage , release cytokine signal transmit surface cell bind pathogen-associated molecule cell surface pattern recognition receptor know toll-like receptor . TAK-242 ( resatorvid ) small molecule suppressor pathogen-induced release inflammatory cytokine act inhibit TLR-4 mediate signal . Because inhibitory effect suppress cytokine level , resatorvid develop treatment severe sepsis . The study end DSMB determine insufficient cytokine suppression 150-subject analysis within Stage 1 study .</detailed_description>
