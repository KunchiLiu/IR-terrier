	<brief_summary>Streptococcus pneumoniae , also know Pneumococcus , common cause pneumonia transplant patient . There vaccine available infection call Pneumovax . Recently , new vaccine infection call Prevnar develop may effective . Vaccinating bone marrow donor transplant may boost recipient 's immune response vaccine transplant . This study do compare vaccinate donor one vaccine affect recipient 's immune system response vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pneumonia Vaccine Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients : Usefulness Donor Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial design assess immunogenicity new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine cohort allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( allo-HSCT ) recipient . This do use approach pre-transplant donor immunization post-transplant recipient immunization . Response compare standard 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine . It hypothesize conjugate vaccine provide enhance response group immunosuppressed individual respond poorly standard polysaccharide vaccine . Specific objective study : - To determine antibody response vaccine via measurement total antibody response opsonophagocytic assay . This assay advantage assess patient antibody response represent truly functional antibody display opsonic activity pneumococcus likely well correlate protective efficacy . - To determine acute adverse reaction conjugate vaccine population . Results trial help lay foundation development rationale optimal pneumococcal vaccination strategy would prevent significant morbidity patient population . We hypothesize pneumococcal conjugate vaccine , due T-cell dependent response great immunogenicity protective effect allo-HSCT population use donor immunization strategy .</detailed_description>
