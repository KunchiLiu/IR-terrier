	<brief_summary>The study focus dose response relation office dust office dust spike component fungi know damp building . The first aim study investigate dust cause objective change change lung function , nasal geometry , inflammatory indicator tear nasal lavage , tear film stability cell exposure level relevant indoor air . The controlled exposure variable air concentration office dust spike Glucan simulate worse case scenario . Aim 1 : Confirm support causality objective effect exposures dust spike Glucan focus inflammatory response . This do negation hypothesis significant effect find variable question . Aim 2 estimate threshold slope DR relation effect measure show effect exposure . At best study supply variable zero response clean air three non-zero response dust . Thresholds slope estimate graphically linear regression accumulate response model . Aim 3 confirmation atopic person histamine sensitive person nasal provocation test different response effect measure show significant effect exposures dust spike Glucan . Risk group status therefore include analysis main variable explain variable . Potential additional aim 4 : Chemical biological characterization office dust use study . Aim 4 investigation dose response relation explorative measure , previous investigation show indication dose response relation . For priory hypothesis exist analysis must arrange ad hoc . The explain variable exposure risk group status . One challenge investigation unspecific effect cause mixed exposure specific objective effect measure available subjective measure introduce . Therefore need development new objective measure health effect air pollution . Some related new biomarkers respiratory effect bio-sample take condensed exhaled breath . Aim 5 : Developments new objective measure health effect air pollution . After experiment investigate logistic regression sensitivity index establish .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The basic procedure exposure experiment human subject expose controlled variation dust spike Glucan . Their response monitor , minute hour exposure later even . Two group subject select pre-investigation use strict selection exclusion criterion . The two group atopic person responder Histamine RSM nasal provocation test . The group expose controlled condition climate chamber IMA office dust spike Glucan ( procedure amount DAMOS ) clean air level ( less 20 micro-g/m3 ( TSP ) 150 , 300 700 micro-g/m3 ( TSP ) . In pre-investigation exposure session number personal characteristic measure register used statistical analysis explain variable response subject . The dust exposure characterize though size distribution gravimetrically use up-to-date analytical instrument . To optimise exposure several pilot study make . Only effect measure , previously show clear indication response dust exposure , include study . The timetable include pre-investigations , two repetition exposure design ( run 1 2 ) , analyse bio-samples , statistical analysis , report . The study include main study several additional work-packages , activate funding become available .</detailed_description>
