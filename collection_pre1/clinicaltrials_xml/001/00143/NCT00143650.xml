	<brief_summary>The study focus two main question : 1 . The importance dampness building home dust factor subjects= response . 2 . Can measure use KLINIR predict subject ’ response dust ? This study therefore arrange test follow hypothesis : 1 . Does dust general cause inflammatory/body perception e.g . irritation symptom index . 2 . Does dust include effective odorants affect IAQ index ? 3 . Does dampness increase content organic inorganic compound e.g . microbial origin cause dust reactive ? ( Differences two type dust ) 4 . Is sensitivity subject explain response exposure , b , c ? ( Subject group sensitivity index ) As explorative investigation biomarkers exposures sensitivity practical usage test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study focus two main question : c. The importance dampness building home dust factor subjects= response . d. Can measure use KLINIR predict subject ’ response dust ? As explorative investigation biomarkers exposures sensitivity test practical use . These investigation make experimental exposure subject dust dry water damage building . The response healthy KLINIR-sensitive subject predict use personal sensitivity measure . The design 3x3 Latin square design ( cross-over design ) . The subject control comparison placebo ( clean air ) make . The study double blind subject inform detail design exposures experiment ask . This design eliminate effect learn training investigation , also effect season weekday eliminate . The subject expose 3-4 week interval eliminate carry-over effect one exposure session next . The design replicate three time three different group subject include 9 subject . Each group nine divide three group three subject .</detailed_description>
