	<detailed_description>Poor inhibitory control propose central cognitive deficit symptomatology associate Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . ADHD highly heritable disorder increase incidence among sibling affected individual . Although study investigate candidate gene underway , yet remain unclear via mechanism presence risk gene lead symptomatology . There evidence suggest individual increase genetic risk display cognitive deficit associate disorder . In particular poor inhibitory control put forward potential marker familial ADHD . Neuroimaging technique make possible investigate neural substrate cognitive deficit associate psychiatric disorder . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use demonstrate neural substrate cognitive brain function affect ADHD . Using task tax inhibitory system vary level task demand , demonstrate increased susceptibility interference child ADHD parallel difference brain activation , child display relative lack fronto-striatal activation . In recent study , demonstrate unaffected sibling patient ADHD show cortical volumetric deficit , similar patient . This suggest individual increase risk ADHD share neural basis cognitive deficit associate disorder . In current proposal set investigate expression genetic susceptibility ADHD brain functioning . We study cognitive functioning patient ADHD , unaffected sibling healthy match control focus cognitive control . Our aim 1 ) determine whether increase familial risk ADHD associate differential pattern brain activation compare normally develop child , performance task design probe cognitive function compromise ADHD 2 ) determine whether differential pattern activation similar boy ADHD unaffected sibling . We intend include 30 boy ADHD , 30 brother without ADHD , 30 match normal control 3 study focus cognitive control similar cognitive function compromise ADHD . We include 10 boy group study . The proposed study utilize variation parametric go nogo paradigm previously develop . All subject ask participate functional MR scan session last hour . The whole visit last maximum two hour . There known risk associate MR scanning , therefore procedure consider completely safe . By participate simulation prior scan , also minimize anxiety subject . Furthermore , study immediately terminate subject becomes anxious , otherwise indicate longer wish participate . All subject offer gift certificate token appreciation effort . In addition , reimburse travel expense .</detailed_description>
