	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study investigate brain whether ADHD represent disruption delay brain development . Children adolescents without ADHD ask participate several MRI session , two year apart . This allow u chart brain development time , typical development ADHD , therefore address whether ADHD represent disruption delay typical brain development .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) common impair neuropsychiatric disorder childhood , occur 3 5 % school-age child . This disorder associate great risk low academic achievement , school dropout , poor family peer relation , aggression , substance abuse , drive accident chronic problem adult adaptation . As , enormous impact utilization medical health care service , direct indirect cost disorder high . However , large number child symptoms dissipate grow go function normally lead typical life . This lead speculation ADHD may much represent disruption , delay brain development . This aim study address issue . There grow body research support existence deficit brain anatomy associated ADHD , evidence reduction overall brain size , cortical gray matter subcortical structure . However , report effect size small result always consistent . Anatomical MRI study may easily confound , brain development complex associate progressive regressive change brain anatomy . In study , propose combine longitudinal data large cohort child adolescents state-of-the-art image method ( include diffusion tensor image voxelbased morphometry ) investigate brain development ADHD . This allow u address question whether ADHD represent disruption delay brain development .</detailed_description>
