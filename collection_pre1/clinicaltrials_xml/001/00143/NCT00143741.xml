	<brief_title>Use Atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) Decrease Panel Reactive Antibody Titers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation desire treatment choice subject end-stage kidney disease ( ESRD ) . The average waiting time subject receive `` deceased donor '' kidney transplant 3-5 year . Currently , 60,000 subject national wait list , 13,000-14,000 kidney transplant perform year . Approximately , 25 % subject wait list `` highly sensitize '' , mean natural protein ( antibody ) aggressively protect body invasion foreign protein . These individual often difficult time accept transplant kidney . The purpose study identify subject highly sensitized antibody , treat way , may become possible transplant kidney . Drugs like atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) may decrease level anti-bodies increase possibility subject receive kidney transplant . This research study do currently , limit cumbersome treatment option address issue , subject highly sensitized antibody , may unfortunately wait long time may never get transplant .</detailed_description>
