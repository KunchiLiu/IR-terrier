	<brief_summary>Excessive prolongation international normalize ratio ( INR ) occur frequently patient take warfarin ; fact , one six INR value desire range . Excessive prolongation INR clinically important risk bleed approximately double one point increase INR beyond usual therapeutic range . Thus , treatment strategy rapidly reliably lower excessively prolonged INR desire range potential reduce bleed . When take patient INR value 4.5 10 , small dose oral vitamin K ( 1 mg 2.5mg ) reduces INR desire INR range 75 % case within 24 hour administration . If warfarin simply withheld , vitamin K give , 25 % patient INR desire range 24 hour . However , vitamin K rarely give patient . In recent survey carry group , less 20 % patient would give low dose oral vitamin K group physicians regularly supervise warfarin therapy . The common treatment excessive prolongation INR simply withhold warfarin allow INR fall therapeutic range . Although strategy effective safety never adequately examine . In fact , recent evidence suggest patient INR value 6.0 treated simple warfarin withdrawal risk major bleed 4 % two week develop prolonged INR . When ask give oral vitamin K non-bleeding patient excessively prolonged INR , physicians generally give one three reason : ( 1 ) They convince oral vitamin K reduce bleeding . ( 2 ) They concern oral vitamin K may cause thrombosis . ( 3 ) In contrast simply withhold warfarin , give oral vitamin K require patient visit physician , physician must supply vitamin K. The investigator hypothesize routine practice administer oral vitamin K patient excessively prolong INR value cause patient major , life-threatening fatal bleeds . To convince physician oral vitamin K administer non-bleeding patient INR value 4.5 , investigator propose study investigator anticipate demonstrate oral vitamin K reduce bleeding , cause thrombosis , administer home without direct physician supervision . To accomplish goal , investigator propose multinational , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . The investigator randomize patient INR value 4.5 10.0 receive 1.25 mg oral vitamin K placebo follow bleed thrombosis . Patients INR value 10.0 receive single 1.25 mg dose oral vitamin K. Successful completion study establish treatment standard support clinical data , turn , change way patient take warfarin present excessively prolonged INR treat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>What problem address ? Although warfarin highly effective anticoagulant , cause bleed . The risk bleed individual increase number factor , include age , gender previous hemorrhage . However , single strong predictor hemorrhage excessive prolongation international normalize ratio ( INR ) . We show low-dose oral vitamin K reliably reduce excessively prolonged INR ; hypothesize treatment also reduce risk hemorrhage without increase risk thrombosis . The objective study demonstrate low dose oral vitamin K improve safety oral anticoagulant therapy , reduce risk bleed without cause thrombosis , patient present INR value 4.5 . Background rationale study ( Efficacy toxicity warfarin ) : Warfarin reduces risk first recurrent venous thrombosis 80 90 percent , reduces risk first recurrent arterial thrombosis 50 65 percent ( 1 ; 2 ) . In North America 1 million patient receive warfarin daily basis Ontario 300,000 prescription warfarin fill annually . The major toxicity warfarin bleeding , may fatal . Although bleeding may occur international normalize ratio ( INR ) `` therapeutic range '' ( 2.0 3.0 indication ) , many patient bleed supratherapeutic INR value . Indeed , large study suggest patient spend 10 20 percent time excessively prolong INR value one anticoagulation clinic report 7,279 patient manage 5 year interval , 1,995 least one INR great 6.0 ( 3 ) . Furthermore , risk hemorrhage approximately double increase INR 1.0 unit ( 4-7 ) . Background rationale study ( Risks excessively prolong INR ) The risk hemorrhage patient asymptomatic warfarin-associated coagulopathy highlight Hylek colleague ( 8 ) . In study , 114 patient present INR value 6.0 simply warfarin withheld INR decline desired range . In two-week follow-up period , 10 114 ( 8.8 % , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 3.6 14.0 ) patient experience bleed include 5 major two fatal bleeds . Thus risk major hemorrhage fatal hemorrhage 4.4 % ( 95 % CI 0.6 , 8.1 ) , 1.7 % ( 95 % CI 0 , 4.2 ) , respectively . Similarly , Oden colleague ( 4 ) demonstrate mortality rate attributable bleeding per 100 patient year follow-up 22 fold high patient INR value 6.0 6.9 , compare patient INR 2.0 2.4 . The observation excessive elevation INR associate bleed suggests identify effective technique lower INR reduce bleed . Background Rationale ( Treatment warfarin associate coagulopathy ) Other simply withhold warfarin allow INR fall desire range , two `` active '' approach use low INR excessively anticoagulated patient . Transfusion coagulation factor concentrate replaces miss coagulation factor . Supplemental vitamin K antagonize effect warfarin , thus increase endogenous synthesis factor . Transfusion human derive recombinant clotting factor rapidly normalize INR . However , treatment expensive , inconvenient , associate infectious complication allergy thrombosis , never prospectively studied non-bleeding patient ( 9 ) . Thus , transfusion therapy use correct excessively prolonged INR value non-bleeding patient . What study design prove ? We anticipate study prove : 1 . Oral vitamin K reduce risk bleed patient take warfarin present INR value 4.5 10.0 . 2 . That oral vitamin K increase risk thrombosis give patient . 3 . That low dose oral vitamin K reduce INR acceptable range high proportion patient present INR 10.0 Why trial need ? This trial need new evidence confirm association prolong INR value risk bleed ( 4 ; 8 ) , new evidence suggest oral vitamin K effectively lower INR ( 12-15 ; 17 ) thus may reduce bleed ( 13 ) , risk : benefit ratio oral vitamin K remain unclear . Studies previously publish group suggest oral vitamin K effectively reduce INR value . However , despite rigour , publication high-impact journal , study yet influence clinical practice . A recent US survey confirm clinician face excessively anticoagulated , non-bleeding patient would simply withhold warfarin give oral vitamin K ( 18 ) . The lack use vitamin K attributable least four factor ; first , study unequivocally show oral vitamin K reduce risk hemorrhage . Although first randomize trial ( 13 ) find less bleeding patient receive vitamin K , bleed placebo group occur one week randomization , make possible observation attributable play chance . Second , concern , irrespective route administration , vitamin K may place patient risk thrombosis `` over-correcting '' INR . Although two randomized trial show evidence low dose vitamin K cause either warfarin resistance thrombosis , least one publication suggest might occur ( 19 ) . Third , `` passive '' strategy merely withhold warfarin simple , inexpensive easily apply . Finally , access convenient form vitamin K major barrier convenient easily administer form oral vitamin K many jurisdiction . Study design implementation Trial design : This study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicentre clinical trial concurrent cohort study ( Appendix 1 - Study Flow Diagram ) . The randomized trial enrol patient INR value 4.5 10.0 . The cohort study enrol patient INR value 10.0 . Study intervention : RANDOMIZED TRIAL ( INR 4.5 10.0 ) : Eligible , consent patient temporarily discontinue warfarin randomize receive single capsule contain either 1.25 mg oral vitamin K active drug . ( ) COHORT STUDY ( INR 10.0 ) : All eligible consenting patient receive 2.5 mg vitamin K. Allocation study group : Three type anticoagulant clinic exist . In first type , patient present clinic blood-drawing , wait INR . Their dose warfarin prescribed base result . Within type clinic , patient identify time INR prolongation discover . Consent study obtain , patient provide next numbered study kit , single capsule contain either vitamin K placebo administer . In clinic point-of-care device use INR determination INR confirm venous sample patient enrol . For purpose study , centre call `` group 1 '' site . The common anticoagulant clinic one within patient INR determine outside laboratory , result call clinic physician , nurse pharmacist . Within clinic , impractical require patient present hospital assessment randomization day INR prolong . For clinic use model , propose patient find INR 4.5 assess telephone inclusion exclusion criterion study . Patients meet inclusion criterion , exclusion criterion , ask provide consent telephone study . Once consent obtain , study form complete use information obtain telephone , study centre arrange next numbered study drug allocate patient . The study drug ship patient use taxi cab dedicate courier service . Receipt consumption drug confirm time mandatory centre assessment follow day . For purpose study , centre use form allocation study drug call `` group 2 '' centre . In group 1 group 2 centre patient INR value 10.0 give two capsule contain 1.25 mg oral vitamin K. A supply capsule provide participate centre clearly mark container . This drug provide patient fashion drug provide patient cohort study . Timely return INR value problem INR value obtain outside hospital . In case , example , INR may available late evening day follow blood draw . If 24 hour elapse since blood draw time patient would eligible randomization patient deem ineligible study . In case however , INR repeat ( example hospital clinic laboratory ) INR remain 4.5 , patient enrol . Patients self-administer study drug ask bring unused capsule clinic day follow randomization . This ensure take correct capsule . The least frequently use mechanism monitor warfarin therapy patient self-monitoring use point care test ( POCT ) device . Patients monitor POCT responsible determine INR adjust warfarin dose base INR result . Patients self-monitor use point care test find INR 4.5 ask contact clinic staff . Prior approach consent enter study patient 's INR confirm venous blood sample organize host anticoagulant clinic . Given patient group randomize study centre , purpose study patient consider group 1 . Group 1 group 2 defines arbitrary group . Clinics may mixture group 1 group 2 patient ; clinic patient sign consent randomize `` home '' ( group 2 patient ) others randomize receive study drug `` centre '' . Irrespective patient time randomization allocate next available study drug supply time randomization . Procedure deal patient eligible study one occasion : Patients enrol either randomize trial cohort study . However , patient previously enrol cohort study present late occasion INR 4.5 10 would eligible randomized trial . Similarly , patient previously enrol randomized trial eligible cohort study . To ensure result randomized trial confound participation cohort study , minimum one month must pass time patient enrol cohort study subsequent enrollment randomize clinical trial . Method randomization : Randomization perform use computer-generated randomization sequence . This sequence guide drug packaging . Study drug supply package dispense study centre lot sequentially number appropriately label pill bottle . An additional , clearly label , supply capsule contain 1.25 mg oral vitamin K dispense participate centre . Patients randomize allocate next , sequentially number pill bottle . What frequency study follow-up ? Patients see participate clinical centre study staff day 1 14 ( +/- 2 day ) randomization . All patient contact telephone day 3 , 7 , 28 90 . Additional contact INR sample necessary manage patient 's anticoagulant therapy make require . What study outcome measure ? The primary outcome measure `` clinically overt bleeding '' . Secondary outcome measure `` adjudication-confirmed major hemorrhage '' , `` adjudication-confirmed thrombotic event '' , `` change INR value '' `` cost effectiveness '' Why include bleeding , endpoint define ? Previous study antithrombotic treatment treatment warfarin-associated coagulopathy use major hemorrhage measure bleed . In study , `` major hemorrhage '' choose primary measure detect independently adjudicate easily `` hemorrhage '' . In addition , study antithrombotic therapy , patient acute thrombosis ( high risk acute thrombosis ) enrol . In set acute thrombosis likely physicians patient willing tolerate minor bleed one `` unavoidable '' complication antithrombotic therapy . Neither patient physician would willing stop effective treatment acute , life threaten thrombosis minor bleeding . In set warfarin maintenance therapy , however , minor bleeding unanticipated bruising , epistaxis excessive menstrual blood loss set excessively prolong INR value disconcerting , disruptive , costly patient seek medical attention likely reduce compliance . Since believe reduce bleed complication ( major minor ) necessary maximize utility warfarin therapy , choose measure bleed primary outcome measure efficacy . We feel appropriate since study intervention mask ; thus although minor bleed subjective , patient unaware treatment allocation thus treatment receive influence report clinical event . Secondary outcome measure : Major Hemorrhage : Since anticipate many clinician wish know impact vitamin K `` major bleeding '' , also compare rate adjudication-confirmed major bleeds group . All bleed event submit central adjudication committee major bleeding confirm standardize , masked central adjudication ( see appendix 2 ) . Thrombotic Events : At clinic visit telephone follow-up sign symptom thrombotic event seek . If thrombotic event suspect , appropriate objective documentation obtain forwarded Central Adjudication Committee . The committee adjudicate thrombotic event use validate , pre-specified criterion ( see appendix 2 ) . Cost-effectiveness : Details number frequency intervention , outcomes associate morbidity collect . This material form basis subsequent cost-effectiveness study . Given vitamin K inexpensive ( oral vitamin K cost less 5 $ Canadian per dose jurisdiction ) expense bleed high ( previous cost effectiveness study estimate episode major bleeding cost 5000 $ Canadian per event ( 20 ) ) likely use oral vitamin K highly cost-effective . Plan ascertain outcome event : Signs symptom ( major minor ) bleed thrombosis seek clinic visit telephone call . If bleeding thrombosis report , available objective documentation hospital record , transfusion record result diagnostic therapeutic investigation ( endoscopy ) obtain . Minor bleed frequently lead medical evaluation ; case minor bleeding report specific setting , nature , duration require action seek event report patient . Determination sample size ( INR 4.5 10.0 ) : The estimated rate bleeding patient present excessive , warfarin-associated prolongation INR , treat simple warfarin withdrawal , 8 % ensue 30 day ( 8 ) . We believe clinician would willing treat minimum 20 patient oral vitamin K prevent one episode bleeding , thus `` minimally clinically important difference '' wish reliably detect 5 % ( 21 ; 22 ) . This reduction risk bleeding ( 8 % receive placebo 3 % receive vitamin K ) represent 60 % risk reduction . It reasonable expect 1.25 mg oral vitamin K produce least 60 % reduction risk bleed base follow assumption : ( ) The INR placebo arm likely decline one INR point first 24 hour INR vitamin K group likely decline 3.9 INR point . These decline base result achieve 3 publish study oral vitamin K ( 10 ; 12 ; 13 ) . ( b ) A 2.9 point reduction INR associate 6 fold reduction risk hemorrhage ( base assumption 1 point increase INR double risk bleeding ( 4-7 ) ) . ( c ) The 60 percent risk reduction conservative interpretation effect 6 fold decrease risk hemorrhage . To accomplish goal reliably detect 5 % reduction risk hemorrhage need enrol 330 patient arm study 80 % power two side alpha 0.05 . This sample size calculation base follow assumption : Figure 4 : Sample size calculation 2N = 4 ( Zα + Z ) 2 * ( 1-p ) / ( pc-pi ) 2 Zα = 1.96 , Z = 0.84 pc proportion success control group ( bleed ) equal 0.92 pi proportion success intervention group ( bleed ) equal 0.97 p = ( pi + pc ) /2 thus total sample size 652 To accommodate anticipated loss follow ( minimal previous study ) increase sample size 5 % ( 690 patient ) Sample size determination ( cohort study ) : The sample size cohort study entirely one convenience ; since good quality data efficacy oral vitamin K patient INR value 10.0 simply enrol follow patient become available . Data derive cohort might use basis future investigation . Study administration : Accounting non-compliance : The sample size adjust reflect non-compliance . It unlikely patient non-compliant single dose study drug administer time randomization . For example , previous study none 134 patient receive oral vitamin K non-compliant lose follow-up . Accounting `` loss follow-up '' : We previously patient lose follow-up vitamin K study , anticipate rate study negligible ( i.e . le 5 % ) . The low rate loss follow-up due , large part , fact ( ) patient 2 clinic visit course study ( day 1 14 ) ( b ) follow-up perform telephone , Further , patient receive warfarin aware need monitoring warfarin thus accept need periodic medical laboratory re-assessments . This increase likelihood willing able participate study follow-up . Coordination study : The study coordinate Thromboembolism Research Unit St Joseph 's Hospital Hamilton , Ontario . Data submission coordinate centre occur secure , web-based database system , supplement paper copy case report form maintain clinical centre . Details web-based data-entry system currently determine ; revise study manual full data entry detail include subsequent version study manual . The study coordinate professional data coordinator , base St Joseph 's hospital . Data integrity ensure manually review electronic database 5 % submit record , compare copy paper CRFs relevant centre . The randomization sequence patient generate coordinate centre ; coordinator remain masked treatment allocation time . Provision study drug : There oral form vitamin K currently market Canada , thus previous investigation use intravenous formulation administer mouth . Demonstration tablet form effective would simplify ( encourage ) use oral vitamin K. A 5 mg vitamin K tablet available Canada United States ( Canada drug available Health Canada approval ) . For study , supply 5 mg vitamin K tablet obtain Merck Frosst Incorporated . Study pharmacies compound drug produce match capsule contain either lactose lactose 1.25 mg vitamin K. This pharmacy also provide drug packaging responsible preparing study drug kit consist sequentially number drug supply clinical centre ( follow randomization list provide study coordinate centre ) supply label 1.25 mg capsule ( cohort study ) . These supply distribute , coordinate centre participate clinical centre . Role participate investigator : Dr Mark Crowther principal applicant primarily responsible aspect study . Drs Ageno Garcia , addition fulfil role co-investigators , coordinate recruitment management centre Italy , United States , respectively . Drs Crowther , Ageno Garcia comprise executive steer committee meet teleconference least monthly discus specific trial implementation management issue . The steer committee consist member executive steer committee , well Canadian participate investigator ( Drs Blostein , Anderson , Wells , Kahn , Ginsberg , Kovacs , Kearon Selby ) Dr Witt United States . Telephone Steering Committee meeting occur six monthly , frequently determine Principal Investigator . The Steering Committee responsible overall conduct study , act recommendation study 's subcommittee . Participating centre represent letter support grant include ; Duke University ( Dr Ortel ) ; University Washington ( Dr Wittkowsky ) ; University Massachusetts ( Dr Becker ) ; IRCCS Maggiore Hospital Milano ( Dr Moia ) ; Centro Emostasi e Trombosi Reggio Emilia ( Dr Silingardi ) ; Instituti Ospitalieri di Cremona ( Dr Testa Alatri ) ; Dr. Siragusa ( Policlinico Palermo ) Adjudication committee : An Adjudication Committee three thromboembolism expert otherwise involve study convened.All report hemorrhagic thrombotic event review committee , use available source documentation adjudicate clinical event . This committee convene complete data available first 20 bleeds clot , subsequently multiple 20 event . To ensure uniformity , episodes hemorrhage adjudicate accord pre-specified criterion . The committee report result adjudication Coordinating Centre inclusion study database . Although adjudication event may seem excessive possible adjudication could `` upgrade '' event deem minor site investigator , highlight need central review bleed event . DSMB : An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) constitute . The committee consist 2 expert otherwise involve study . Proposed member Dr Martin O'Donnell ( Thromboembolism expert , Henderson Hospital , Hamilton , Ontario ) Dr William Geerts ( Thromboembolism expert , Sunnybrook Hospital , Toronto , Ontario ) . The number outcome event record cohort study randomize trial separately . The DSMB convene total 20 ( multiple thereof ) adjudication-confirmed major bleeds thrombus occur either randomize trial cohort study . While remain masked treatment allocation , DSMB review source material describe event . If DSMB concern type number event , right ask steer committee allow contact study statistician unblinded , unplanned , interim analysis safety perform . Only experience thromboembolism expert invite onto committee , ensure interim analysis perform response less significant observation . If interim analysis suggest significant safety concern ( example , evidence excess major bleed thrombotic event , indicate P value le 0.05 ) DSMB right recommend Steering Committee study close . Analysis plan : Primary analysis ( Randomized trial ) : The primary analysis simple comparison proportion patient placebo vitamin K arm adjudication-confirmed bleeding . The proportion group compare use Chi square Fisher 's exact test , dictate number event . Secondary analysis : The proportion patient group major hemorrhage , thrombosis composite adverse outcome ( thromboembolism , death major hemorrhage ) perform use Chi square Fisher 's exact technique , indicate . A regression analysis perform determine baseline variable include receipt drug placebo , demographic characteristic , degree prolongation international normalized ratio baseline variable predict adverse event . Finally , mean INR value two group compare use ANOVA . Primary analysis ( cohort study ) : The change INR , number bleeds clot present graphically . Frequency analysis ( Randomized trial ) : Three interim analysis plan . The first occur 200 patient enrol . In analysis , statistician aware treatment allocation ; overall rate bleeding entire population compute . Assuming balanced allocation , anticipate event rate 5.7 percent . If observed rate hemorrhage 2.5 percent 5.7 percent , revise sample size calculate . If revise sample size suggest unfeasibly large study ( define need 500 patient per arm ) , statistician determine whether limit enrollment patient INR value 6.0 enrich event rate sufficiently allow completion study le 500 patient per arm . In analysis , blind treatment allocation maintain sample size revise assume 60 percent reduction risk bleed vitamin K arm . Second third interim analysis perform 350 500 patient enrol . If sample size adjust first interim analysis , second third analysis perform 60 % 75 % , respectively , required sample size enrol . For analysis , study statistician unblinded treatment allocation proportion patient suffer adjudication confirm major hemorrhage compare two group . If treatment advantage measure two-tailed Chi-square Fisher 's exact test P value le 0.001 statistician recommend study Steering Committee study stop . Any result result recommendation continue study . Frequency analysis ( Cohort study ) : No interim analysis plan . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB , see ) instruct monitor frequency hemorrhage group . If upper limit 95 % CI risk hemorrhage exceed 5 % minimum 20 patient complete 90 day outcome ascertainment , DSMB notify Steering Committee risk hemorrhage cohort study excessive . The steer committee decide whether arm study discontinue intervention modify . Planned subgroup analyse The response vitamin K placebo measure two way study . The first way observe number clinical event ( thrombosis hemorrhage ) second observe change INR value day study drug next day . The number clinical event study likely relatively low , reduce power subgroup analyse determine baseline variable degree prolongation INR influence response oral vitamin K. However , since change INR value occur patient since INR continuous variable , subgroup analysis examines influence baseline variable ( degree prolongation INR ) response vitamin K power perform change INR value dependant variable . This analysis include : baseline demographic variable ( gender , weight , presence cancer , age ) , degree prolongation INR , baseline maintenance warfarin dose indication warfarin therapy . The ability variables predict change INR vitamin K placebo group calculate . The ultimate goal line investigation generate hypothesis factor ( ) influence response vitamin K. These hypothesis could test future study within dose vitamin K modify base presence absence risk factor .</detailed_description>
