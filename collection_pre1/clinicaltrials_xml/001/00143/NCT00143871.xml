	<brief_title>Study Rituximab Plus High-Dose Chemotherapy Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination chemotherapy standard treatment initial therapy advance stage aggressive Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) . Standard chemotherapy cure less 40 % patient . When patient relapse , may eligible receive high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell support . Multiple study show value high-dose chemotherapy , increase disease-free survival overall survival , compare second-line conventional chemotherapy . Unfortunately high-dose chemotherapy curative less half patient receive , treatment strategy need improve cure rate . Another treatment option call immunotherapy test lymphoma patient . Immunotherapy involve attempt use immune system product immune system fight lymphoma . For example , NHL cell protein call CD20 surface . Rituximab antibody direct CD20 protein , may result death lymphoma cell . Patients study receive Rituximab see safe treatment option NHL patient .</detailed_description>
