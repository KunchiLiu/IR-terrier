	<brief_title>An RSA DEXA Study Migration Proximal Interphalangeal ( PIP ) Joint Prostheses Hand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There large patient group primary osteoarthritis ( OA ) secondary osteoarthritis due joint-associated fracture , repeat trauma joint surroundings , congenital joint-deformity , hyper mobility diabetes . There 2 preservative surgical treatment alternative PIP joint OA ; namely arthrodesis arthroplasty . Arthroplasty choice treatment , preserve motion feasible , patient excellent result arthrodesis . There several arthroplasty technique include fibrous interposition , palmar plate advancement , metallic metalloplastic hinge one piece polymeric plastic hinge device . In study , use 2 part metallic implant design minimize bone removal preserve collateral ligament PIP joint provide stable joint particularly impose lateral force . Preservation capsule prosthesis allow diversion transverse force axial torque prosthesis endosteal interface lateral cortex collateral ligament . The semi-constrained design provide physiological articulation , besides centered anatomical configuration allow reliable restoration tendon movement joint . All probably diminishes mechanical contribution osteolysis subsidence bone prosthesis interface prolongs time survival prosthesis . All improvement prosthetic design important provide well possibility patient regain near-normal joint condition . The prosthesis two component - one proximal one distal . The proximal part symmetric shallow bicondylar anatomic configuration fix stem intramedullary cavity proximal phalanx . The distal component fabricate polyethylene press-molded metal back stem intramedullary cavity middle phalanx . Both implant part CoCr alloy coat plasma spray porous titanium . Studies show bone grow well titanium surface experimental implant , also fix bone use cement . With new type PIP prostheses often excellent total long-term pain relief little loss movement . The stability become considerably well compare old type prosthesis . The outcome however dependant skill experience surgeon . The purpose study compare early migration periprosthetic bone change cement versus non-cemented interphalangeal implant . Furthermore thorough occupational therapist evaluation functional progress prior surgery assess . To evaluate implant-bone micromotions , metal marker place implant preoperatively marker fix phalangeal bone intra-operatively . This allow u evaluate implant micromotion stereo x-ray photogrammetric computer analysis call RSA Orthopaedic Center , Aarhus University Hospital . Follow-up stereo x-ray schedule 1 week , 6 week , 12 week , 6 month , 1 year 2 year post-surgery . Periprosthetic bone density evaluate 1 week , 1 year 2 year upon inclusion Orthopaedic Center , Aarhus University Hospital . An occupational therapist evaluate joint range motion , pain , edema grip strength prior surgery throughout 2 year follow .</detailed_description>
