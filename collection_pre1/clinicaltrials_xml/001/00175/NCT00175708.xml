	<brief_title>Pedobarographic Assessments Clubfoot Treated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : Using Tekscan 's HRMat Pressure assessment system EMED pedobarography system distribution force measure across plantar surface subject ' foot . The Tekscan system comprise 50 cm square pressure sensor connect computer interface . The data collection make two part : Part I : Static Profile : The child ask stand mat 6 second five trial . During time data collection software collect force data across foot 60 time per second . The software calculate centre force well change pressure static trial . The foot assess distribution force across hindfoot , midfoot , forefoot , big toe . In addition , centre gravity also determine . Part II : Dynamic Profile : The dynamic test involve child walk across mat total 5 pass per foot . Measurements force take 60 Hz . The EMED-x400 sensor rectangular dimension 47.5 cm 32 cm . Measurements force record rate 400 Hz . Foam piece ( include EMED platform ) construct around platform establish level safe runway patient walk along . The EMED platform connect computer interface operate Novel analysis software . The subject ask walk across mat independently ordinary pace . The foot require land centre mat , minimum three trial per foot10 . Plantar pressure record take 10-20 minute subject .</detailed_description>
