	<detailed_description>Findings early study variety experimental model atherosclerosis effect dietary protein suggest protein vegetable source less cholesterolemic atherogenic protein animal source . Throughout later part 20th century sporadic interest effect protein type amino acid profile blood lipid concentration atherosclerosis . A major focus evaluation compare protein base amino acid profile , often express lysine ( Lys ) arginine ( Arg ) ratio ( Lys : Arg ) . While animal study provide important information regard significance Lys : Arg determine cholesterolemic response dietary protein , interpretation data must do caution since study conduct animal model different lipoprotein distribution metabolism human . Moreover , mechanistic insight response yet determine . While favorable effect Arg endothelial function appear consistent Arg administer use supplement , effect dietary Arg naturally present protein rich food yet determine . The aim proposal explore significance Lys : Arg ratio response lipids lipoprotein concentration dietary protein evaluate effect dietary Lys : Arg cardiovascular disease risk factor endothelial function .</detailed_description>
