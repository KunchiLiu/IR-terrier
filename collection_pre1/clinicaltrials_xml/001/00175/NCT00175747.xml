	<brief_title>A Phase IIb Trial Pulmicort Turbuhaler ( Budesonide )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer common cause cancer death worldwide : mortality rate lung cancer exceed colon , breast , prostate cancer combine . Former heavy smoker retain elevated risk lung cancer even year stop smoking . Given large number current former smoker increase incidence lung cancer among woman , lung cancer remain major health issue next several decade . One potential strategy inhibit development invasive cancer risk develop lung cancer use chemopreventive agent regress exist intraepithelial neoplastic lesion , prevent progression lesion cancer , prevent development new lesion . We perform randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase IIb clinical trial determine efficacy safety inhale budesonide ( Pulmicort Turbuhaler ) chemopreventive agent smoker premalignant lesion bronchial epithelium . The primary end point change histopathologic grade repeat biopsy sit end 6 month . The secondary end point study aim gather additional insight potential effect budesonide central bronchial epithelial lung compartment , peripheral lung could directly assess bronchoscopic biopsy , drug effect biomarkers reflect ability inhale budesonide reach target . Thus , balance proliferation apoptosis examine immunohistochemical analysis expression proliferative marker MIB-1 antiapoptotic protein BclII . Expression tumor suppressor p53 , function maintain integrity human genome , major determinant cell survival , frequently mutate lung cancer , assess bronchial biopsy . Examination peripheral pulmonary nodule via spiral compute tomography ( CT ) perform ass , first time , potential usefulness spiral CT response chemopreventive intervention . Finally , prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , prostaglandin derive arachidonic acid metabolism whose synthesis inhibit glucocorticoid , measure bronchoalveolar lavage fluid . Study subject recruit use television program , radio broadcast , local newspaper June 1 , 2000 , November 1 , 2001 . Eligibility include age &gt; 40 year , smoke history 30 pack-years , normal organ function . Sputum sample obtain use simultaneous high-frequency chest wall oscillation ThAIRapy Vest ( Advanced Respiratory , Inc. , St. Paul , MN ) inhalation 3 % hypertonic saline ultrasonic nebulizer 12 minute . The subject instruct cough intermittently induction procedure least 2 hour afterward produce sputum sample . The sputum sample fix 50 % etomidate , cytospun onto glass slide , stain Feulgen-thionin . The DNA content , size , shape , DNA distribution least 3000 epithelial cell nucleus per sample measure use automate high-resolution image cytometry ( Cyto-Savant system ; Perceptronix Medical , Inc. , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada ; ref . 13 , 14 ) . Cells classify either epithelial , inflammatory , pyknotic base feature , experienced cytotechnologist confirm automated classification . Diploid DNA DNA index 1.0 . Atypia define presence equal five cell DNA index &gt; 1.2 . This criterion base retrospective analysis 1885 apparently healthy volunteer smoker underwent sputum quantitative cytometry part Lung Health Study British Columbia Cancer Agency since 1990 . Participants follow repeat chest X-ray autofluorescence bronchoscopy National Cancer Institute-sponsored chemoprevention trial British Columbia Cancer Registry Medical Services Plan Hospital Registry . Using threshold equal five cell DNA index &gt; 1.2 , sensitivity detect lung cancer initial screen follow-up 94 % , specificity 38 % mean follow-up 3.2 year . This threshold adopt current study identify smoker high risk lung cancer bronchoscopy . Autofluorescence bronchoscopy perform subject sputum atypia agree undergo bronchoscopy localize area dysplasia use LIFE-Lung device ( Xillix Technologies Corp. , Richmond , British Columbia , Canada ) . Biopsy sample take area abnormal fluorescence least 1.2 mm size , well least two control area normal fluorescence . The median number biopsy sample obtain per subject 6 ( range , 4–14 sample ) . Bronchoalveolar lavage perform use standard technique . The collected fluid ( 30 mL per participant ) immediately place 4°C , differential cell count obtain within 1 hour collection . The fluid separate cell centrifugation freeze –160°C subsequent PGE2 assay . The biopsy sample fix buffered formalin , embed paraffin , serially section . H &amp; E-stained section systematically review two pathologist blind intervention assignment ( J. leRiche , A. Gazdar ) . All biopsy sample classify one follow seven group ( normal , basal cell hyperplasia , metaplasia , mild/moderate/severe dysplasia , carcinoma situ ) accord WHO criteria . Because individual biopsy frequently contain one histologic cell type , diagnosis base advanced histology present . The two pathologist resolve minor ( i.e. , one grade ) differences sample classification telephone consultation . If histopathology diagnosis differ two grade , pathologist review slide , necessary , reach consensus diagnosis verbal communication phone e-mail . One hundred fifty-one subject ( 27 % subject underwent bronchoscopy ) one sit bronchial dysplasia surface diameter &gt; 1.2 mm ( i.e. , great size bronchial biopsy use standard biopsy forceps ) . Only subject dysplastic lesion &gt; 1.2 mm enrol onto chemoprevention trial minimize effect mechanical removal lesion biopsy procedure . Participants randomly assign receive either budesonide ( Pulmicort Turbuhaler ; AstraZeneca , Lund , Sweden ) dose 800 µg twice daily inhalation placebo 6 month . The placebo turbuhalers identical one contain active drug . Randomization stratify accord smoking status ( current versus former ) gender . All study personnel blind study code , confirm independent review . The participant interview monthly compliance drug-related adverse event . Compliance determine drug diary estimation number dose remain turbuhaler . Toxicity monitor accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria , version 2.0.10 Dose modification perform grade 2 toxicity evidence cortisol suppression ( ante meridiem ( AM ) plasma cortisol &lt; 140 nmol/L/L ) . For grade 3 4 toxicity , therapy discontinue toxicity resolve grade 1 less . At time , use study drug resume 75 % dose reduction . All participant underwent second fluorescence bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage 6 month study medication biopsy obtain site biopsied baseline . Biopsy sample also take new area display abnormal fluorescence . The bronchoscopist blind intervention assignment . Current smoker encourage stop smoking invite take part Fresh Start Program British Columbia Cancer Agency . The Clinical Investigations Committees British Columbia Cancer Agency University British Columbia approve study . Written inform consent obtain participant .</detailed_description>
