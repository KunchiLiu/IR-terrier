	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study investigate relationship extent neurologic ( nerve ) impairment patient spinal cord injury well nerve pass spine heart blood vessel work . These nerve call descend spinal sympathetic pathway ( DSSP ) important control many function , include blood pressure . We also wish examine injury severity DSSP function influence blood level nor-epinephrine epinephrine . Nor-epinephrine epinephrine hormone release blood also important control blood pressure . Thus , also look effect extent DSSP dysfunction influence heart rate blood pressure blood level certain enzyme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Orthostatic Intolerance Spinal Cord Injured Individuals Following Bed Rest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects Healthy able-bodied control volunteer , individual acute chronic spinal cord injury , individual undergone period bed rest . ASIA SSR Assessment . The severity injury motor sensory spinal pathway document accordance American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) . The sympathetic skin response ( SSR ) examine order determine completeness injury DSSP . SSRs record subject supine position , room temperature 21-25oC . Subjects rest supine least 30 min begin examination . The procedure take approximately 20-30 min . Self-adhesive electrode apply hand foot patient . SSRs record bilaterally simultaneously hand foot 5 sample band pas 3Hz 3 kHz . The median nerve stimulate ( 0.2ms duration , 10-20mA intensity ) 5-10 SSRs sample record . The latency amplitude SSRs measure compare case . `` Sit test '' . We use sit-up test evaluate blood pressure control orthostatic tolerance . Before test subject lie tilt table , temperature control environment period 10 min . Then subject passively seat 90Â° keep position without move 20 minute . The test abort subject become lightheaded symptomatic . All individual SCI assess continuity DSSP . Continuous non-invasive BP ( Finometer , FMS , Arnhem , The Netherlands ) ECG ( lead II , 3 electrode thorax ) , monitor perform pre-test , post-test . In subject follow measurement plan : recording BP ECG 10 min supine 20 min sit position . Two blood sample collect prior sit-up test 30 min rest supine position 3-5 min sit-up test . Serum level catecholamine examine . Butterfly catheter insert least 30 min prior sit-up test . This allow collection blood without additional stress participant activation catecholamine release venopuncture . Two blood sample draw determine serum level NE E antecubital vein individual immediately orthostatic challenge . Circadian rhythm 24hr Holter monitoring ECG . We obtain continuous HR recording follow analysis determine beat-to-beat HRV 24 hr period . The subject wear portable unit connect electrodes chest-wall . During day subject normal daily activity . We analyze least 3 measurement point ( 10 min interval ) day night period individual . HRV analysis occur off-line : briefly , use autoregressive model frequency domain variable HRV : low-frequency power ( LF , 0.04-0.15 Hz ) , high-frequency power ( HF , 0.15-0.4 Hz ) . LF power believe represent sympathetic tone HF power represent parasympathetic tone .</detailed_description>
