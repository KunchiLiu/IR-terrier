	<detailed_description>BACKBROUND Hip knee replacement commonly perform surgical procedure , 800,000 hip operation carry worldwide year almost 550 hip knee replacement year Ringkoebing County . The main indicator total hip knee replacement intractable pain and/or limitation function manage conservative treatment alone . Leading cause pain include osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , trauma , congenital abnormality , dysplasia osteochondritic disease . In absence treatment provide cure condition osteoarthritis , management direct primarily towards relieve pain re-ducing functional limitation . Joint replacement one surgical option medical treatment fail provide adequate symptom relief . Hip knee replacement major surgical procedure require inpatient physiotherapy out-patient rehabilitation follow stay hospital . Regarding effect optimize perioperative period , systemically critical review randomize control trial ( RCT ) could identify . Only one RCT effect clinical pathway hip knee arthroplasty could identify , study Dowsey et al 1999 , conclude intervention give well effect reduce average length stay 1.5 day . No cost data report study . A systematic review clinical pathway include study Dowsey et al ten non-RCT study conclude clinical pathway total knee total hip arthroplasty reduces cost length stay . A significant great reduction length stay report two resent Danish non-RCT , study Rasmussen et al , accelerate proactive care give study Husted et al , extra resource allocate care give special unit focus length stay maximal 8 day . However nothing know cost effect accelerate proactive care out-side hospital . In summary overall evidence level accelerate perioperative care rehabilitation patient undergoing total hip knee replacement scarce . OBJECTIVES To investigate cost efficacy focus specialize care unit patient undergoing total hip knee replacement To investigate cost effectiveness focus specialize care unit patient under-going total hip knee replacement MATERIALS &amp; METHODS : Randomized control intervention trial cost efficacy cost effectiveness analysis . This study follow recommendation CONSORT Statement . Perioperative study - RCT Study subject All patient plan undergo primary total hip total knee replacement Hospital Holstebro , first contact hospital invite participate study . Exclusion criterion ’ patient operate secondary hip fracture , patient undergoing remission patient able cooperate normally perioperative period . All patient interested participate study give write oral information . After consent participate patient complete baseline questionnaire randomize one two group . Sample size The estimate sample size group followup calculate use actual data hospital Holstebro year 2004 together data pilot study 2005 . The risk perform Type 1 error set 5 % use two-sided analysis , power detect true difference set 80 % . The anticipated reduction length stay set 2 day intervention group , mean length stay 8 day standard deviation ( SD ) 4 day mean length stay 6 day SD 2 day . When use two-sample comparison mean give need least 80 patient , 40 person group follow-up . Randomization Simple randomization ensure equal distribution operation area ( hip : knee ) perform draw envelope box . Intervention Control group Patients control group receive current perioperative care . Intervention group Patients intervention group give perioperative care rehabilitation accord regime advocate The Unit Perioperative Nursing Care , Rigshospitalet study Husted et al . In study perioperative care rehabilitation organize new proactive special care rehabilitation unit patient gather health care staff focus preselected discharge day . Attempts reduce potential bias Masking patient obtain concealment intervention intervention group , secure patient two different group keep apart different room . Masking treat therapist caretaking nurse attempt randomly allocate either usual new preoperative care rehabilitation unit . All personal allocate new preoperative unit receive education participates pre study period . After start intervention period treat therapist caretaking nurse allow attend room patient allocate intervention arm . During intervention period physiotherapists nurse allow discuss intervention person intervention arm . Situation circumstance protocol follow registered use intervention log book . The baseline follow-up data collection perform questionnaire measurement person involve intervention . No attempt make minimize placebo Hawthorne effect , different attention time spend intervention important factor cost effectiveness analysis . Potential contamination regard care give nurse treat therapist record via structure observation care treatment baseline latter part study period . Compliance exercise collect report actual participation plan training questionnaire fill inat day discharge . Follow-up Length stay record use register information outcome measure collect questionnaire discharge , 3 , 12 24 month discharge . Outcome measure Primary outcome measure length stay , health relate quality life measure EQ-5D SF-36/SF-6D . Secondary outcome measure pain measure 6/point ordinal scale , disability measure Harris Hip Score / The Danish Knee Arthroplasty Register Score . Side effect collect register data mortality incidence length stay be-cause deep vein thrombosis . Data analysis The data analyse accord recommendation Sackett et al use intention-to-treat analysis . Chi-square test use categorical data parametric non-parametric statistic two-sample comparison mean use continuous data . The significance level set p &lt; 0.05 . Cost efficacy study perioperative intervention Efficacy study define accord Last JM : The extent specific intervention , procedure , regimen , service produce beneficial result ideal condition . Ideally , determination efficacy base result randomize controlled trial . The question answer accord Drummond MF et al : Can work ? To determine whether proactive perioperative intervention patient undergoing total hip knee replacement cost effective ideal circumstance study perform alongside RCT one hospital . Actual cost seek via available data source patient administer diary collect period 24 month . The collected cost data divide direct cost benefit , indirect cost benefit intangible cost benefit . Direct healthcare cost include peripoperative operation hospital stay cost DRG tax together change cost due perioperative intervention actual price . Direct postoperative primary health care sector cost include cost visit general practitioner , nurse physiotherapist preset price . Direct non-healthcare cost include social sector cost professional home care extra cost nursery home , private home care cost , private rehabilitation cost , cost visit alternative therapist , private help cost transportation cost preset price . Indirect cost cost production loss estimate accord friction method maximum 3 month absenteeism pay work preset salary . Intangible cost benefit collect beneath implicit quality life measure . The cost hold primary outcome measure group . The cost efficacy intervention calculate difference cost related difference effect intervention control group . The cost efficacy analysis perform accord recommendation Drummond et al . Cost effectiveness study perioperative intervention Effectiveness study define accord Last JM : The extent specific intervention , procedure , regimen , service , deployed field routine circumstance , intend specific population . The question answer accord Drum-mond MF et al : Does work ? To determine whether proactive perioperative intervention patient undergoing total hip knee replacement cost effective unit county normal circumstance estimate cost difference efficacy study together im-plementation time , problem cost fully develop intervention hold actual effect difference outcome measure period follow implementation compare period prior implementation . The cost effectiveness analysis perform accord recommendation Drummond et al .</detailed_description>
