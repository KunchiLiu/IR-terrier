	<brief_summary>The purpose trial compare two similar treatment patient diagnosed prostate cancer . The two treatment arm compare : ( Standard Arm ) hormone therapy , prevent production male hormone , testosterone , testicle , pelvic external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) follow high-dose , conformal EBRT boost versus ( Investigational Arm ) hormone therapy pelvic EBRT follow brachytherapy boost ( implantation radioactive iodine source `` seed '' prostate ) . The hypothesis trial patient may experience 5 year actuarial freedom biochemical recurrence prostate cancer follow treatment investigational arm . Biochemical failure declare date post treatment prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) &gt; 2 ng/mL low level previously record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Androgen Suppression Combined With Elective Nodal Dose Escalated Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomly assign equal probability one two treatment arm , Arm 1 Arm 2 , intervention associate Arms follow : Arm 1 : Neoadjuvant , concurrent adjuvant androgen suppression , elective pelvic nodal irradiation ( EPNI ) , high dose conformal EBRT boost prostate , appropriate secondary intervention failure . Arm 2 : Neoadjuvant , concurrent adjuvant androgen suppression , elective pelvic nodal irradiation ( EPNI ) , permanent 125-Iodine brachytherapy boost prostate , appropriate secondary intervention failure . If patient assign Arm 1 , radiation oncologist initiate androgen suppression monitor clinical biochemical response . After 8-month duration neoadjuvant androgen suppression , patient undergo course elective pelvic nodal irradiation ( EPNI ) volume encompass prostate gland , seminal vesicle regional lymph node . The pelvic irradiation follow dose-escalated 3-D conformal EBRT boost prostate appropriate margin . The total radiation dose regional lymphatics 46 Gy prostate dose 78 Gy ICRU reference point minimum dose PTV &gt; 74 Gy . Androgen suppression maintain throughout radiation therapy follow completion radiation therapy patient receive total duration androgen suppression 12 month include neoadjuvant phase . If patient assign Arm 2 , radiation oncologist initiate androgen suppression monitor clinical biochemical response . After 8-month duration neoadjuvant androgen suppression , patient undergo course elective pelvic nodal irradiation ( EPNI ) volume encompass prostate gland , seminal vesicle regional lymph node . The total radiation dose regional lymphatics 46 Gy . Two week follow completion pelvic irradiation , patient undergo permanent 125-Iodine brachytherapy prostate implant facility participate institution team healthcare professional lead Radiation Oncologist experience prostate brachytherapy . To eligible participate , institution must do least 25 case prostate brachytherapy strand source . The minimal peripheral dose ( MPD ) prostate gland implant 115 Gy . A modified peripheral loading technique use effort maintain periurethral dose &lt; 150 % MPD . Androgen suppression maintain throughout radiation therapy patient receive total duration androgen suppression 12 month include neoadjuvant phase . All patient randomize part analysis . The patient remain study whether protocol treatment define assigned arm complete . The end primary intervention define 18 month follow start neoadjuvant androgen suppression arm . Secondary Objectives : Overall survival , metastasis-free survival , pathological local control , incidence acute late side effect complication associate treatment intervention , effect plan intervention QOL rate testosterone recovery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologicallyproven prostate cancer stage T1c T3a ( UICC 1997 ) . 2 . Patients clinically organconfined disease must meet Canadian consensus definition intermediate risk disease ( i.e one : CS = T2b [ UICC1997 = bilateral palpable intracapsular disease ] , GS = 7 , iPSA &gt; 10 20 ) . 3 . Patients Gleason sum 8 and/or PSA &gt; 20 must CT pelvis , nuclear medicine bone scan show evidence nodal ( N0 ) distant metastasis ( M0 ) . 4 . Registration must occur within 36 week biopsy . 5 . Patients clinical pathological evidence seminal vesicle invasion ( stage T3b ) involvement adjacent pelvic organs/structures ( stage T4 ) eligible . 6 . Preintervention PSA must exceed 40 ng ml1 . 7 . Patients must chest xray follow blood test within four week registration : PSA , PAP , testosterone , CBC , electrolytes , BUN , creatinine , AST , LDH alkaline phosphatase . Patients value one test fall outside normal range necessarily ineligible , however , eligibility need review study coordinator . 8 . Patients must ECG within four week registration . Patients ECGs judge significantly abnormal require consultation cardiologist ascertain suitability general spinal anesthesia . 9 . Patients judge clinically prostate volume &gt; 65 cm3 prior start androgen suppression must transrectal ultrasound volume estimation . Patients TRUS prostate volume &gt; 75 cm3 prior start androgen suppression eligible study . 10 . Patients may start neoadjuvant androgen suppression prior registration provide : documentation pretreatment PSA case patient iPSA &gt; 20 and/or Gleason sum 8 , bone scan CT pelvis do prior within 4 week start neoadjuvant androgen suppression . 11 . Patients must receive prior surgical treatment prostate cancer include transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) , transurethral resection bladder neck ( TURB ) , cryotherapy , laser ablation , microwave therapy . 12 . Patients estimated life expectancy least 5 year ECOG performance status 02 . 13 . Patients may receive prior radiation therapy pelvis . 14 . Patients must fit general spinal anesthetic . 15 . Patients Coumadin therapy must able stop therapy safely least 12 day . Documentation safety interruption anticoagulation therapy must provide appropriate specialist physician ( usually cardiologist hematologist ) . 16 . Patients must judge contraindication high dose pelvic irradiation LHRH agonist therapy . 17 . Cancer survivor eligible provide three follow criterion meet : The patient undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy . There evidence recurrence least five year follow potentially curative therapy . ( For nonmelanoma skin cancer fiveyear requirement apply . ) The patient consider treat physician low risk recurrence prior malignancy .</criteria>
