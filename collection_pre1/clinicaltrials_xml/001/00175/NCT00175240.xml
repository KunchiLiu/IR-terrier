	<brief_title>Enhancing Secondary Prevention Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Despite abundant evidence base secondary prevention , practice audit consistently demonstrate substantial `` care gap '' evidence clinical reality many patient Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) offer possible therapy prevention myocardial infarction death . For example , even acute myocardial infarction , almost one fifth patient continue smoke ; half hypertension hyperlipidemia poorly control pressure lipid level ; prove therapy statin , ACE inhibitor , beta-blockers antiplatelet agent under-prescribed . Multiple barrier often responsible lack implementation proven efficacious therapy traditional mean educate practitioner ( journal article , CME , conference , etc ) usually ineffective altering practice . Clearly novel intervention improve quality prescribing need . Local opinion leader trust peer evaluate medical innovation thus influence practice pattern within community . Few control study , however , evaluated effect change prescribing practice common condition CAD . HYPOTHESIS : This trial test 2 quality improvement intervention . The principle hypothesis : one-page evidence summary endorse local opinion leader increase provision secondary prevention therapy patient CAD compare usual care ? The secondary hypothesis : intervention without local opinion leader endorsement improve provision secondary prevention strategy patient CAD compare usual care ? Does local opinion leader endorsement increase effectiveness quality improvement intervention ?</detailed_description>
