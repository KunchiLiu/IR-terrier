	<brief_summary>Promising new technology exist examine small protein shed cancer blood stream . The purpose study see difference protein protein level blood individual early stage lung cancer compare healthy adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection Early Lung Cancer Serum Protein Expression Profiling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective longitudinal patient-based pilot study propose whereby surface enhance laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy ( SELDI-TOF-MS ) use discover validate serum proteomic expression profile diagnostic early lung cancer . A unique approach use compare serum proteomic expression profile patient non-small cell lung cancer compare healthy heavy smoking adult , well difference anatomic pulmonary resection curative intent . Discriminatory proteins select differential expression compare surgical removal tumor . The protein profile blood obtain drain pulmonary vein time resection use identify material potentially shed tumor may serve biomarkers peripheral blood . The serum sample use develop train data set test set validation use class prediction model . Candidate proteomic pattern serve basis large prospective multi-centre clinical trial .</detailed_description>
