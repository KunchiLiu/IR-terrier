	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Although much write influence local opinion leader clinical practice , control study effect , almost none attempted change prescribe community chronic condition congestive heart failure ( CHF ) ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) . These two condition common good evidence best prevent morbidity mortality - good evidence quality care , general , suboptimal . Practice audits demonstrate half eligible CHF patient prescribe ACE inhibitor ( few still reach appropriate target dos ) less one-third patient establish IHD prescribe statin ( many few reach recommend cholesterol target ) . It apparent intervention improve quality prescribe urgently need . HYPOTHESIS : An intervention consist patient-specific one-page evidence summary , generate endorsed local opinion leader , able change prescribe practice community-based primary care physician . DESIGN : A single centre randomize control trial compare opinion leader intervention usual care . Based random allocation physicians one large Canadian health region , patient CHF IHD ( receive ACE inhibitor statin , respectively ) recruit community pharmacy allocate intervention usual care . The primary outcome improvement prescription proven efficacious therapy CHF ( ACE inhibitor ) IHD ( statin ) within 6 month intervention .</brief_summary>
