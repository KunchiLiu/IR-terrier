	<brief_title>Acute Myocardial Infarction With HyperOxemic Therapy II ( AMIHOT II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AMIHOT II clinical trial design focus study promise patient subset complete AMIHOT study . A brief synopsis AMIHOT experience provide , follow description AMIHOT II study . The pivotal AMIHOT clinical study TherOx® Aqueous Oxygen ( AO ) System treat post acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) patient approve FDA January 10 , 2002 IDE G980257/S011 . The study objective determine whether adjunctive administration AO Therapy immediately successful PCI group patient present less 24 hour AMI symptom onset improve leave ventricular function reduces area infarction , increase incidence 30-day Major Adverse Cardiac Events ( MACE ) compare control group receive PCI standard-of-care treatment . 30-day MACE comprises combine incidence death , reinfarction , target vessel revascularization , stroke . Two hundred eighty-nine ( 289 ) patient enrol January 16 , 2002 December 24 , 2003 , include 20 run-in subject 269 randomized patient . Three independent biomarkers ( infarct size reduction , regional wall motion score improvement three month , reduction ST segment elevation ) designate co-primary endpoint evaluate effectiveness AO Therapy . The study design demonstrate superiority AO Therapy group compare control endpoint , demonstrate non-inferiority AO Therapy group compare Control respect 30-day MACE . The study population comprise qualify AMI patient treat either PCI alone AO Therapy adjunct successful PCI within 24 hour symptom onset . The observed 30-day MACE rate comparable AO Therapy Control group . The AMIHOT trial result reveal positive trend overall study population favor AO Therapy test group three co-primary endpoint . These favorable result demonstrate require level statistical significance claim superiority . However , examination pre-specified patient subset , anterior AMI subject treat within six hour symptom onset , show promising result analysis surrogate endpoint data , form basis IDE supplement request approval conduct new trial focus defined patient population . TherOx design follow-up clinical trial focus anterior AMI subject treat within six hour , utilize Bayesian statistical design incorporate exist AMIHOT data , new propose AMIHOT II study data , hierarchical model combine analysis . The key difference propose AMIHOT II study previously conduct AMIHOT trial : - Focused target patient population - anterior AMI subject revascularized within six hour symptom onset . ( AMIHOT include patient revascularized within 24 hour symptom onset , irrespective location infarct . ) - Single effectiveness endpoint - infarct size reduction measure 14-day Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT imaging . ( AMIHOT include 3 co-primary endpoint ) - Non-inferiority comparison 30-day MACE rate within 6 % safety delta ( AMIHOT propose 8 % delta . ) - Randomization scheme - AMIHOT II randomize 2.8:1 ( AO Therapy Group : Control Group ) basis , compare ( 1:1 ) randomization use AMIHOT . The method administration AO Therapy basic design AO System AO Cartridge change since approval grant FDA conduct AMIHOT trial . The IDE number AMIHOT II clinical proposal consistent AMIHOT ( G980257 ) .</detailed_description>
