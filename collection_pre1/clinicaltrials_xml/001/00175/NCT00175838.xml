	<detailed_description>The myeloproliferative disease , primary thrombocythaemia ( PT ) , median age presentation 60 year increasingly recognise early age . The risk untreated condition micro-vascular major vessel occlusive event haemorrhage . Older patient previous thrombosis particularly prone experience significant vascular occlusive event . An anti-aggregating agent , aspirin , show reduce/alleviate minor ischaemic symptom . Therefore , except patient haemorrhagic symptom , peptic ulceration know side-effects aspirin , use low-dose aspirin appropriate . Myelofibrotic acute leukaemic transformation long-term complication PT . The ability therapeutic agent delay myelofibrosis reduce/increase incidence acute leukaemia prospective study unknown . However , examination retrospective data provide anxiety leukaemogenic risk commonly use cytoreductive agent , hydroxyurea . From analysis relatively small study primary thrombocythaemia , incidence acute leukaemic transformation select patient treated hydroxyurea give 5-10 % 4-11 year ( 1 ) . Based risk factor vascular occlusion , old patient thrombotic history high platelet count separate 'high ' risk group . There evidence randomise prospective study 'high-risk ' patient cytoreduction hydroxyurea significantly reduce vascular occlusion ( 2 ) . The observed reduction prospective study 29 month median duration 24 % give cytoreductive treatment 3.6 % receive hydroxyurea â€” approximately six-fold reduction . In another prospective study patient receive hydroxyurea , incidence major thrombotic event 5.6 % /year ( 3 ) . In high-risk patient , cytoreductive treatment therefore give . The high risk arm PT1 trial , close , assess cytoreductive treatment choice high risk patient result suggest hydroxyurea plus aspirin superior anagrelide plus aspirin ( 4 ) . In patient low risk vascular occlusion dilemma risk vascular occlusion untreated patient relatively low , include major life-threatening event . In two small prospective study patient receive platelet lower agent , observe major complication 3 % 4.1 % per year total complication 5.1 % 10.5 % per year respectively ( 1 ) . Cyto-reductive treatment prevent event one could predict similar reduction complication see high-risk patient . However , evidence patient age 40 year complication rate one quarter see patient age 40 - 59 year ( 5 ) . Therefore decide divide patient low risk vascular occlusion 'intermediate ' 'low risk ' group . Patients age 40-59 year fall 'intermediate risk ' group randomise cytoreduction , receive aspirin . Patients 40 year form 'low-risk ' group receive aspirin alone . Cyto-reductive treatment might also delay myelofibrotic transformation observe primary polycythaemia . However , benefit possible reduction vaso-occlusive episode need balance potential long-term risk increase acute leukaemic transformation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The proposal include many patient PT possible include previously diagnose patient whether received treatment . Thus patient eligible assume meet diagnostic criterion exclusion criterion ( see ) . It necessary stratify patient accord previous treatment . This information collect entry study . Informed consent course require change therapeutic strategy . The diagnostic criterion primary thrombocythaemia : Platelet count &gt; 600x109/l . No evidence overt polycythaemia ( confirm RCM necessary ) polycythaemia mask coexistent iron deficiency . No Philadelphia chromosome . Absence peripheral blood and/or marrow appearance myelodysplasia , myelofibrosis . No know cause reactive thrombocytosis . Particular care take exclude iron deficiency premenopausal woman . Notes : In asymptomatic patient , platelet count observe period least 2 month confirm &gt; 600x109/l , allow cause reactive thrombocytosis become overt . If PCV normal upper limit ( , males &gt; 0.51 , female &gt; 0.48 ) high normal range patient palpable splenomegaly measure RCM . Iron deficient primary polycythaemia ( polycythaemia vera ) strongly suggest Hb/PCV normal presence iron deficient red cell change . In situation , iron therapy potentially dangerous . Exceeding rarely , bcrabl positive Philadelphia chromosome negative patient present high platelet count little elevation WBC count . The feature suggest necessary examine bcrabl , : basophilia , leftshift WBC , granulocyte count &gt; 16x109/l , difficulty control platelet count , megakaryocytes low ploidy ( NAP usually unhelpful ) . A normal ESR , CRP plasma viscosity useful exclude reactive thrombocytosis . Written inform consent obtain accordance NCRI requirement . Patients impaired hepatic / renal function exclude although respective biochemical test monitor therapy reduce dos cytoreductive agent use , particularly case hydroxyurea renal dysfunction . High risk feature ( follow ) : Age &gt; or= 60 year Platelet count &gt; or= 1500x109/l ( current previous ) ( ) History ischaemia , thrombosis embolic event ( include erythromelalgia ) ( b ) Haemorrhage consider related PT ( b ) Presence hypertension ( c ) diabetes ( ) The manufacturer hydroxyurea state avoid pregnancy lactate woman . Similarly , hydroxyurea prescribe woman doubt use effective contraceptive method . Exclude patient hydroxyurea therapy , therefore , 'intermediate ' risk randomisation patient current leg ulcer . Notes definition high risk : In patient borderline count allocation patient high risk group base platelet count alone rely least three sample take separate occasion least 2 month . Documentation previous thromboembolic , ischaemic haemorrhagic event give patient 's entry proforma . Hypertension define patient require hypotensive therapy . Diabetes define patient require therapy hypoglycaemic agent .</criteria>
