	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Osteoporosis progressive condition cause loss bone mass , skeletal fragility , fracture . Fractures result pain , disability , deformity , death . Osteoporosis major population health problem affect 1.4 million Canadians , 25 % woman 12 % men age 50 year . Current guideline recommend aggressive secondary prevention patient osteoporosis suffer fracture , patient high 20 % risk fracture follow year , proven efficacious treatment reduce risk 40-60 % . Nevertheless , recent study show patient under-recognized under-treated , demonstrate care gap evidence-based best practice usual care . All patient osteoporotic fracture ( i.e. , hip , vertebra , wrist ) benefit treatment . However , patient present wrist fracture may best suit intervention improve secondary prevention practice , wrist fracture “ sentinel event ” natural history osteoporosis : common , easily diagnose , always present medical attention , occur year devastate costly fracture hip vertebra . OBJECTIVES : The primary objective study improve quality care patient present ED osteoporosis fracture wrist , increase use proven efficacious osteoporosis treatment . This primary study outcome , define start one hormone replacement therapy , bisphosphonate , raloxifene , calcitonin within 6 month fracture wrist . HYPOTHESIS : A quality improvement intervention direct patient primary care physician increase use proven efficacious osteoporosis treatment . The intervention multiple component include : notification system patient-specific reminder primary care physician , locally develop treatment guideline endorse opinion leader , patient education counseling . The study hypothesis test compare intervention usual care control , prospective nonrandomized controlled trial . SPECIFIC AIMS : To determine whether propose intervention can- - 1 . Increase use proven efficacious osteoporosis treatment patient fracture wrist , - 2 . Increase appropriate use bone mineral density testing , - 3 . Increase patient ’ knowledge osteoporosis satisfaction .</detailed_description>
