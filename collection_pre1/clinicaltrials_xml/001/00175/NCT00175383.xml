	<brief_summary>Brachytherapy , Transperineal implantation prostate ( TPIP ) , recognize form treatment localize cancer prostate . TPIP use British Columbia Cancer Agency ( BCCA ) since 1998 . As part treatment , patient also require hormone therapy 6 month . This give injection drug call LHRH agonist . The LHRH agonist make either short-acting ( 1-month ) long-acting ( 3 month ) injection . The LHRH agonist lower testosterone level , help make delivery TPIP easy , effective . There specific guideline regard use LHRH agonist treatment brachytherapy , however policy whether short-acting long-acting LHRH agonist use . Analysis result BC show seem delay time testosterone level return normal men receive long-acting LHRH agonist compare short-acting LHRH agonist , however know sure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The suppression testosterone castrate level definite advantage term prostate volume downsizing , disease control ease Brachytherapy , patient population . The improved potency preservation rate see brachytherapy , compare treatment radical prostatectomy external beam , may important determinant patient 's choice treatment modality . Hence , testosterone recovery important endpoint consider patient population since prolongation testosterone suppression may also delay return erectile function . In order compare impact LHRH agonist preparation rate testosterone recovery , propose randomized clinical trial use one versus three-month Leuprolide preparation patient otherwise suitable Brachytherapy Program . The primary objective study median time testosterone recovery patient receive 6 X 1-month 2 X 3-month LHrH preparation TPIP radical treatment limited stage prostate cancer . In context , testosterone recovery define return low limit normal patient 's age group well return pre treatment level . Analysis mainly focus time testosterone recovery define return low limit normal patient 's age group well return pre treatment level . The low limit normal define 5.8nmol/L 5.5nmol/L &lt; 50 &gt; 50 year old Changes PSA level , QOL erectile function also record</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient elect undergo brachytherapy treatment adenocarcinoma prostate otherwise recommend treatment LHRH agonist . All patient must confirm histological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate elect treat transperineal implantation prostate . Eligible patient confirm clinical stage T1 T2 ( UICC 1997 stag system ) 1 . PSA &gt; 10 &lt; 15 Gleason score &lt; 7 , OR 2 . PSA &lt; 10 Gleason score = 7 OR 3 . Prostate volume &gt; 50cc measure trans rectal ultrasound While criterion 1 2 mutually exclusive , criterion 3 present alone combination criterion 1 OR 2 . Otherwise patient able give inform consent life expectancy . 2 year .</criteria>
