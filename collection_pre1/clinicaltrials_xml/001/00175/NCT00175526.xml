	<detailed_description>In North America , pre-eclampsia ( 'toxaemia pregnancy ' ) common cause woman die shortly pregnancy . It also common reason baby otherwise well deliver prematurely ; intent purpose protect maternal health safety . In many way similar systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( 'septicaemia ' ) . This project part three part strategy well understand mechanisms disease pre-eclampsia investigate potential disease-modifying therapy , namely , recombinant human activate protein C. We survey Canadian practice , undertaken feasibility pilot study project . At present , management pre-eclampsia guide expert opinion well-based firm evidence . What require clinical tool accurately determine woman 's risk adverse outcome , thereby reduce risk woman safely prolong pregnancy remote term ( improve fetal outcomes ) . This research project , ' severity score pre-eclampsia , ' develop clinical tool specific condition . To develop validate tool recruit 3000 woman Canada , UK , Australasia admit hospital either pre-eclampsia one variant . At time , majority death associate pre-eclampsia occur low middle income country , recruit 3000 woman Uganda , China , Fiji , South Africa Pakistan pre-eclampsia . We use cohort test model ensure accurately predicts risk new population . This severity score use clinically ( guide management ) research ( clinical trial basic science research ) , provide evidence base build future practice , improve outcome pregnant woman baby .</detailed_description>
