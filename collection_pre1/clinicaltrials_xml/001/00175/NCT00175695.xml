	<brief_summary>Short description primary purpose protocol intend lay public . Include brief statement study hypothesis Pre-eclampsia ( toxemia pregnancy ) cause death among pregnant woman North America . It also cause many complication fetus ( unborn child ) neonate ( newborn child ) . Pre-eclampsia define high blood pressure ( hypertension ) , loss protein urine ( proteinuria ) , disorder many body system , include blood clotting ( coagulation ) inflammation . What need compound safely prolong pregnancy , give baby time grow inside mother , help recovery mother delivery . We go investigate compound ( recombinant human activate protein C ( rhAPC ) ) potential modify disease activity pre-eclampsia reduce coagulation inflammation disorder . rhAPC effective patient suffer septic shock . We test rhAPC woman develop severe pre-eclampsia two way . First , woman severe pre-eclampsia remote term carry small baby ( intent : safely prolong pregnancy ) . Second , woman severe pre-eclampsia baby deliver ( include woman first group ) , whose disease develops/worsens delivery ( intent : switch disease dangerous complication arise ) . This study preliminary one look possible risk benefit woman . Only 40 woman study provide initial evidence base large international trial plan . We study pregnancy outcomes well marker disease activity , gain well understanding mechanisms woman become unwell .</brief_summary>
