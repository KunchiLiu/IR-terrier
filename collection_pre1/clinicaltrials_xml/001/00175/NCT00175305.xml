	<detailed_description>Prader-Willi Syndrome Obesity : Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) genetic disorder occur 1/10,000 1/15,000 live birth . Clinical characteristic include neonatal infantile central hypotonia feed problem poor weight gain follow 1-3 year hyperphagia excessive weight gain . Patients also characteristic facial feature , short stature ( possibly due growth hormone [ GH ] deficiency hypothalamic origin ) , hypogonadism , increase pain threshold , global developmental delay variable mental retardation . Obesity clearly one cardinal feature PWS . It result tremendous distress parent affect child significant health problem complication include hypertension , sleep apnea diabetes . More 1/3 patient PWS weigh 200 % ideal body weight . Obesity think result mainly hyperphagia , persistent hunger increase caloric intake , decrease perception satiety obsessive compulsive behaviour primarily food relate . Decreased physical activity associate hypotonia and/or decrease energy expenditure also think play role pathophysiology obesity . The treatment obesity PWS difficult require constant involvement parent caregiver establishment rigid structure around young patient : increased physical activity , hide food , lock fridge etc . Recently , study effect growth hormone ( GH ) treatment ( approved indication patient PWS US irrespective GH status ) body composition PWS perform . While GH , among favourable effect , significantly improve body composition ( increased lean mass decrease fat mass ) , long-term effect body mass index modest variable . Thus , obesity clearly one great challenge face parent patient PWS treatment modality presently successful . Ghrelin : Ghrelin recently discover peptide stimulates appetite GH secretion . Ghrelin increase fast decrease follow meal , think play role meal initiation human . In obese adult young patient ( without PWS ) , ghrelin decrease compare control , lean subject suggest play causal role development obesity . In contrast , PWS patient characterize extremely high circulate ghrelin level ( 3 10 time higher compare control ) . The mechanisms underlying ghrelin increase PWS unclear . The gene encode ghrelin locate chromosome 3 human PWS associate functional loss paternally express gene locate chromosome 15 ( patient affect PWS present deletion area 15q11-13 [ 70 % ] uniparental disomy maternal chromosome 15 [ 30 % ] ) . A logical hypothesis miss gene may part pathway regulate ghrelin expression . Thus , elevate ghrelin concentration observe PWS least raise possibility ghrelin may play etiological role food-seeking behaviour report patient . In support hypothesis , significant correlation hunger sensation ghrelin concentration recently report combined group 6 lean control 7 patient PWS . Somatostatin Somatostatin Analogues : Somatostatin hormone circulate 2 main form : 14 amino acid peptide ( SST-14 , mainly brain , include hypothalamus ) 28 amino acid peptide ( SST-28 , mainly gastrointestinal tract ) . Somatostatin inhibit GH insulin secretion . Somatostatin also powerful regulator gastric activity decrease gastrin release , acid output gastric motility . The somatostatin analogue octreotide ( Sandostatin® , Novartis ) contain 8 amino acid similar SST-14 . It effective treatment neonatal hyperinsulinism ( condition characterize excessive inappropriate secretion insulin cause severe hypoglycemia infant ) acromegaly ( condition characterize excessive GH production pituitary ) . Sandostatin LAR® recent long-acting analogue somatostatin use treatment acromegaly less often child 's hyperinsulinism . Sandostatin LAR® therapy may associate significant side-effects ) : - Reduction bile production gallbladder contractility increase risk cholesterol gallstone . However , tend resolve either spontaneously therapy discontinue ursodiol despite remain therapy . Therefore , gallbladder ultrasound part routine follow-up patient receive octreotide prolong period . - Decreased height velocity secondary inhibition GH secretion . This effect variable intensity present need take account case prolong octreotide treatment . In proposed study , 12 week octreotide treatment expect significant long-term effect longitudinal growth . Octreotide interfere GH action PWS subject receive concomitant exogenous human GH . - Glucose intolerance . Prolonged octreotide treatment associate impaired glucose tolerance secondary decrease insulin secretion . However , octreotide treatment result weight loss , improvement glucose tolerance observe . Therefore , parameter reflect glucose tolerance must follow part Sandostatin LAR® therapy . Other side effect include nausea , abdominal cramp , diarrhea flatulence usually subside 2 week treatment . Effect Somatostatin Analogues Ghrelin Weight Gain : Somatostatin show decrease ghrelin concentration normal subject well patient PWS acromegaly . In nine lean young men , continuous SC infusion octreotide ( 600 microg/24 hour ) cause 50 % decrease ghrelin concentration . In patient PWS , use dose 5 microg Sandostatin/kg body weight , SC , three time day , Hacqq et al observe 67 % drop ghrelin concentration . The study short duration ( 1 week ) result suggest somatostatin may indeed helpful decrease ghrelin concentration patient PWS . There complication . In adult acromegaly ( age 25-59 year , mean BMI 28.9 kg/m2 ) , fast ghrelin concentration decrease patient ( mean 54 % , range 30-74 ) follow treatment Sandostatin LAR® ( 10 30 mg/4-6 week ) 3-29 month . Finally , Lustig et al report effect daily injection octreotide 6 month group child severe hypothalamic obesity due brain tumor treatment and/or cranial irradiation . They observe weight gain octreotide-treated patient minimal ( + 1.2 kg/6 mo ) compare placebo group ( + 9.2 kg/6 mo ) . Bile sludging and/or gallstone observe 44 % patient resolve ursodiol therapy . Ghrelin concentration measure study . Thus , somatostatin analogue cause marked decrease ghrelin concentration control subject well patient PWS . Whether associate sustained decrease ghrelin concentration whether decrease ghrelin associate decrease appetite unknown studied present project .</detailed_description>
