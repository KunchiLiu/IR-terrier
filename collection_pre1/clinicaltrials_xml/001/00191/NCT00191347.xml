	<brief_summary>This study design determine efficacy biweekly pemetrexed/gemcitabine regimen give patient metastatic breast cancer . Each agent well demonstrated antitumor activity patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer . In addition , phase I combination trial two agent , durable tumor response see one three heavily pretreated breast cancer patient ( Adjei et al . 2000 ) . Therefore , reasonable expect combination pemetrexed gemcitabine administer may associate considerably anti-tumor activity either agent alone . If activity see study , randomize study compare combination active agent combination active agent consider .</brief_summary>
