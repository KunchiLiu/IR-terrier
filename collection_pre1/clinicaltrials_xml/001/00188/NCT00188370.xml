	<brief_summary>A group researcher Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital discover specific form cell death 'apoptosis ' detect use high-frequency ultrasound image . This type cell death recognize occur tumour response various different chemotherapeutic drug response radiation therapy . This group researcher confirm high-frequency ultrasound detect apoptosis response tumour treatment experimentally use cell culture experimental animal system . The ultrasound approach evaluate clinically 3-year clinical trial enrol target 200 patient include Hodgkin 's disease non-Hodgkin 's disease lymphoma patient , melanoma patient patient basal cell carcinoma . Our hope able use type image system future clinically monitor effect therapy tumour rapidly detect tumour respond change therapy make much quicker presently possible .</brief_summary>
