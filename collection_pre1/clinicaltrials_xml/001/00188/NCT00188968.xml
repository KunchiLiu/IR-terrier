	<brief_summary>Very premature infant uniformly mature function lung breathe well mature regulation mechanisms breathe regularly . Assistance mechanical respirator common . However , prolong use respirator cause long-term complication . Furthermore , commonly use drug improve regularity breathing may long-term consequence recently recognize . This study compare two different type assistance use nasally apply breathe assist device . The aim see type assistance best avoid need prolong respirator use drug regulate breathing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Synchronized Nasal Ventilation Premature Infants .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early extubation premature infant may limit deleterious effect positive pressure ventilation . The primary cause failure extubation ( need reintubation ) apnea prematurity . Standard treatment improve extubation success decrease apnea prematurity use nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) , use methylxanthines , . Recent literature suggest methylxanthines may significant effect long-term neurodevelopmental outcome . This primary objective study investigate effect synchronize nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation ( sNIPPV ) combine standard nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) versus standard nCPAP alone , need reintubation need methylxanthine therapy premature infant . The study period primary objective first 7 day immediately initial extubation premature infant birth weight 500-1250 gram . A secondary objective identify difference duration time free endotracheal intubation duration time free methylxanthine use two treatment modality measure first extubation attempt . The study randomize , control trial use new CPAP machine ( Infant Flow advanceâ„¢ ) able provide nCPAP without sNIPPV . Because mechanic sNIPPV mode , blind study possible . The study pragmatic design allow medical staff make clinical decision ventilatory management base routinely used criterion thus evaluate study intervention everyday clinical environment . Analysis intention-to-treat basis .</detailed_description>
