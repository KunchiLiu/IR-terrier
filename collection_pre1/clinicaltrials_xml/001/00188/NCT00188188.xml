	<brief_summary>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus relatively common autoimmune disease affect mainly women.Cardiovascular disease result accelerate atherosclerosis major cause mortality morbidity SLE.Previous research show 35-40 % patient SLE abnormalities myocardial perfusion even coronary stenosis coronary angiography . The reason frequent perfusion abnormality absence angiographically significant CAD remain uncertain , could conceivably result endothelial dysfunction . In SLE , coronary endothelial dysfunction could result inflammatory process involve SLE disease , find could explain correlation disease activity development CAD patients.As endothelial dysfunction may account accelerated atherosclerosis cardiac perfusion defect ( without angiographically significant coronary lesion ) . We propose first evaluate whether endothelial dysfunction occur patient frequent patient myocardial perfusion abnormality . Endothelial function assess measure flow-mediated brachial artery dilatation . In 250 patient include study correlate endothelial function myocardial perfusion abnormality SLE disease activity , treatment presence CAD risk factor In subgroup patient ( estimate 5 patient ) clinically indicate , coronary angiography perform order ass presence significant coronary stenosis ( &gt; 50 % ) , coronary artery reserve coronary endothelial dysfunction . We attempt reverse abnormality endothelial function myocardial perfusion therapy ACE inhibitor ( Quinapril ) .Patients myocardial perfusion abnormality randomise receive Medication A ( oral Quinapril Placebo ) 8 week , baseline investigation repeat switch receive medication B ( Quinapril placebo ) 8 week follow repeat investigation .</brief_summary>
