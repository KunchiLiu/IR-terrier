	<brief_summary>Cardiac surgery improve survival quality life people heart disease . Nonetheless , several complication continue adversely affect outcome follow cardiac surgery . Kidney failure particularly important complication associate increase death duration hospitalization . The severe form postoperative kidney failure , need dialysis , uncommon present . It however likely increase future . Patients undergoing cardiac surgery get old heart failure , diabetes , high blood pressure , pre-existing kidney disease . Given risk factor postoperative kidney injury , dialysis rate likely increase . Although multiple therapy test , none prevent postoperative kidney failure . N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) drug commonly use treat Tylenol overdose . Over past 2 year , also use prevent kidney damage exposure IV dye . There good evidence NAC reduce kidney damage IV dye exposure . There strong reason believe NAC may also prevent postoperative kidney failure . NAC safe . Its major side-effects allergic reaction , serious reaction rare . Since dialysis uncommon , large study need determine NAC prevents postoperative dialysis . In situation , pilot study need determine large trial feasible . This proposal describe pilot study . We determine NAC 's effect creatinine clearance , measure well kidney work . Reduced creatinine clearance closely related dialysis death cardiac surgery . This biological marker allow u determine NAC 's effect kidney function reduce sample size . If NAC improve creatinine clearance , would suggest NAC prevents postoperative dialysis , would justify large study . A pilot study help u estimate many patient willing participate similar study , vital planning future large study . Finally , result estimate well NAC reduce dialysis rate . This need calculate sample size future studies.The study design randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial among patient undergo bypass surgery heart valve surgery Toronto General Hospital ( Toronto , ON ) . We recruit 176 people increase risk develop kidney failure surgery . Participants receive either NAC sugar solution operation . If participant return home within month surgery , contact home 30th day surgery determine kidney-related problem since return home . All participant return Toronto General Hospital ( TGH ) 8th week surgery creatinine blood test weight .</brief_summary>
