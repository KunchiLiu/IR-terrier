	<brief_title>Cognitive Function Fatigue Colorectal Cancer ( CRC ) Patients After Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We undertake prospective , longitudinal control study fatigue cognitive function 120 patient localize CRC receive 5FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy . Each patient evaluate baseline 6 , 12 24 month fatigue ( use FACT-F questionnaire ) cognitive function , use validated test : comprise traditional neuropsychological test computerise CANTAB™ , less dependent fluency English . Results chemotherapy compare pre-chemotherapy assessment ( patient act control ) . Since baseline evaluation may confound recent diagnosis surgery include independent control group 120 patient undergone surgery CRC receive chemotherapy . Patients find cognitive change offer comprehensive neuropsychological assessment . We also evaluate quality life ( QOL ) use FACT-G questionnaire anxiety depression use General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ ) . Blood test include hormone level , cytokine , homocysteine , procoagulants apo-lipoprotein E-є4 allele status evaluate possible mechanism . Finally , since chemotherapy CRC evolve include toxic drug oxaliplatin irinotecan , perform parallel pilot study evaluate pt early recurrent metastatic CRC receive drug , use similar method evaluation .</detailed_description>
