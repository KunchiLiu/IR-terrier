	<brief_summary>This study design help decide whether CAT scan perform low dose radiation ( Minimum dose CT scan ) good Chest X-Ray detecting recurrence lung cancer chest ( surgery ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimum Dose Computed Tomography Thorax Follow-up Patients With Resected Lung Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung Carcinoma expect kill 18,900 men woman Canada 2004 . This combined total next three common cancer . The important factor determines patient survival stage disease presentation . Surgical resection best chance cure . However , patient undergo lung resection curative intent significant incidence second lung cancer 2 % per year recurrence rate 38 % 5 year . The current follow-up patient relies periodic physical examination chest radiography ( CXR ) . However , CXR insensitive detection lung nodule compare standard Computed Tomography thorax ( SDCT ) . Computed Tomography detect small lung nodule CXR however , radiation dose SDCT roughly equivalent 20 CXR examination . Screening study use Low Dose CT Thorax ( LDCT ) subject high risk lung cancer demonstrate LDCT detects three time many nodule CXR four time many primary lung cancer one-third dose SDCT . Phantom clinical work LDCT perform UHN/MSH suggest reduction radiation dose ( Minimum Dose CT -MnDCT ) possible nodule detection . Minimum dose CT perform dose one sixth SDCT.In addition , MnDCT confirm sensitive nodule detection technique , could use 1 . Increase interval repeat out-patient assessment thereby 2 . Reduce overall cost surveillance inconvenience patient 3 . Free clinic time surgeon review patient reduce wait list</detailed_description>
