	<brief_summary>Conformal dose escalate radiation therapy ( CRT ) standard treatment patient low intermediate risk prostate cancer . CRT require accurate daily localization prostate prior treatment correct prostate motion set-up error . Cone beam compute tomography ( CT ) accurately localize fiducial marker within prostate . Cone Beam CT also provide important information daily position organ within pelvis . This study aim assess feasibility cone beam CT daily localization prostate well document change size location pelvic organ entire course CRT .</brief_summary>
