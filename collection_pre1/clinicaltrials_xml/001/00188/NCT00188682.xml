	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn application transillumination measurement determination breast cancer risk . The goal demonstrate correlation non-invasive optical transillumination spectroscopy parenchymal density pattern .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast Study Determine Ability Non-Invasive Optical Transillumination Spectroscopy Predict Breast Density .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>X-ray generate image , mammogram , rely density tissue within breast . Tissue density believe associated proliferation stroma and/or epithelium , result increase water associate light absorption decrease lipid associate light absorption . The amount density breast tissue show indicator cancer risk . Thus , assess breast tissue density also important tool determine breast cancer risk . Optical transillumination show give information tissue composition tissue density . Unlike x-ray mammography use ionize radiation , optical transillumination use normal white light deem safe use frequently woman age therefore used situation mammography option . Normal white light shone tissue light leave breast side source detect analyze . Since physiological condition contribute dense breast tissue , see mammography , also unique optical signature . We compare amount dense tissue mammogram , take 12 month , density measurement find optical procedure . The goal able duplicate information mammogram use transillumination technique . All measurement non-invasive blood sample biopsy require .</detailed_description>
