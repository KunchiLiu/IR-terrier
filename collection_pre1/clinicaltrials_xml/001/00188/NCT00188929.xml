	<brief_summary>In study treatment process closely monitor use novel image technology , PET/CT scanner . PET stand Positron Emission Tomography case combine conventional x-ray Computerized Tomography ( CT ) scan . This study particular form treatment . The treatment receive appropriate standard treatment whether study . The goal radiation therapy deliver give amount radiation dose area lymphoma tumour . We study see part tumour reacts radiation treatment , part react , monitor progress treatment combine PET/CT scan . In particular , change size shape tumour occur treatment detect visible image . These image thoroughly analyse . The ability PET/CT scanner detect change course radiation treatment subject study . We also able see information eventually relate predict whether lymphoma tumour completely eradicate treatment .</brief_summary>
