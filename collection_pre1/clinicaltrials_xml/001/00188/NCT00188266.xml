	<brief_summary>In 1991 , South West Oncology Group ( SWOG ) conduct randomize study adjuvant chemotherapy ( 5-fluorouracil folinic acid ) concurrent radiation ( 4500 cGy/25 fraction ) versus surgery alone patient completely resect gastric carcinoma . This landmark study show benefit adjuvant treatment gastric cancer radically change treatment disease . However , result standard treatment severe acute toxicity , despite advance , 50 % patient still die gastric cancer . The investigator hope develop modify protocol use active chemotherapy agent , reduce acute toxicity . Such approach could ultimately study current SWOG approach determine whether addition cisplatinum improve efficacy . Patients decide participate study receive chemotherapy drug call 5-Fluorouracil ( 5FU ) intravenous catheter continuously 12 week . Patients admitted hospital receive chemotherapy need wear waist pack carry small pump deliver medication . They however need make regular visit medication bag change . Patients also receive Cisplatin intravenously every 2 week 4 dos . In addition , patient also receive radiation stomach , lymph node , area surgery . This study also comprise questionnaire u see patient 's cancer treatment affect quality life . Patients regular follow-up physician .</brief_summary>
