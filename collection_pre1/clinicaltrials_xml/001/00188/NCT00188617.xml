	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Of Neoadjuvant Iressa Treatment In Stage 1 NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Secondary Outcomes : - Objectives : - To assess pathologic radiological response rate neoadjuvant Gefitinib treatment - To assess toxicity neoadjuvant Gefitinib treatment clinical stage 1A &amp; 1B NSCLC - Enrollment Treatment administer outpatient basis . Patients may identify thoracic surgeon , respirologists and/or interventional chest radiologist study participation upon clinical radiographic assessment . **Diagnostic biopsy , Pretreatment Investigations If patient already core FNA biopsy referral , material seek original pathologist review inclusion study appropriate consent seek . If patient biopsy upon presentation thoracic surgeon , consent inclusion trial , baseline non-invasive assessment carry percutaneous biopsy mandate part entry study . After non-invasive staging , patient subject biopsy . In collaboration pathology , immediate diagnosis make time fine needle aspiration biopsy ( bronchoscopy ) . After pathologic diagnosis cancer confirm , subject invite additional biopsy perform obtain material correlative study , assume complication technical difficulty arise . These study do collaboration thoracic interventional radiologist Diagnostic Imaging , supervise lung fine needle aspirate biopsy . All patient undergo pre-study assessment symptom , performance status , radiographic assessment blood test ( complete blood count , electrolytes , liver renal function test ) . Assessment response occur 4-week treatment period . Toxicity assess continuously , patient assessment weekly treatment , repeat blood test 2 week image measurable disease 4 week . All subject invite initial diagnostic biopsy subsequent surgical tumor specimen examine part laboratory correlate component study . Patients consider evaluable pharmacodynamic assessment complete least 21 plan 28 day therapy . Once compete , oral Gefitinib administer dose 250 mg ( 1 pill ) daily 28 day prior plan mediastinoscopy . Patients may take pill either without food , encourage take medication approximately time day . If patient forgets take dose , take last miss dose soon remember , long least 12 hour next dose due . If patient vomit take dose , dose may retake tablet see emesis . The last dose Gefitinib administer less 48 hour prior mediastinoscopy surgery . If mediastinoscopy reveals presence Stage III disease , patient 's mediastinoscopy sample may still analyse part correlative study . Patients follow 90 day long require last dose Gefitinib ensure resolution Gefitinib-related toxicity . However patient offer standard therapy stage III disease study protocol , example combination chemotherapy , radiation plus minus surgical resection . If patient proceed thoracotomy post-chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy , resection specimen eligible correlative protocol . **Duration Therapy Follow-up As outline , patient treat 28 day surgery also follow 90 day post-operatively thoracotomy ensure recovery surgery . Accrual estimate 2 patient per month , 18 24 month , base accrual rate thoracic surgical study UHN . Study duration plan August 2004 June 2006 . All patient follow current standard care University Health Network . That , clinic visit chest x-ray every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month third year , annually thereafter . Recorded information include vital status presence absence disease recurrence .</detailed_description>
