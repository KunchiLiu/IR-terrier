	<brief_summary>Cancer anus occur high rate young men HIV cause virus call human papillomavirus ( HPV ) . Anal cancer increase HIV epidemic despite effective therapy HIV . Unfortunately , anal cancer present late stage screen program find early stage . Rates cancer cervical cancer reduce use Pap smear . The researcher ' plan type screen anal cancer do cervical cancer . If abnormality find treatment start . The researcher hope approach help prevent anal cancer . Testing HPV also do see help detect early cancer see accurate different test , pathologist clinical examiner detect agree abnormality . The main outcome presence pre-cancerous early cancer change determine high resolution anoscopy ( HRA ) . HRA involve look microscope anus allow tiny change identify . Pieces tissue take make definite diagnosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anal cancer occur rate 163-fold great young men HIV . It cause another virus , HPV . The incidence double HIV epidemic decrease despite effective antiretroviral therapy . It important anal cancer screen program detect precancerous lesion ; do prevention cervical cancer use cervical Pap smears.We anal Pap smear , HPV test perform high resolution anoscopy magnify detailed view anus . Biopsies do early treatment initiate . It anticipate approach help prevent anal cancer . SPECIFIC AIMS : The aim study determine accuracy pathology human papillomavirus ( HPV ) test identify precancerous change HIV positive men . The primary question determine good anal Pap smear detect precancerous change anus . Secondary question involve : ( ) determination test characteristic anal Pap smear , ( b ) assessment agreement visually detect pre-cancers anoscopists , ( c ) determination viral patient characteristic predict pre-cancer . STUDY DESIGN : This cross-sectional survey HIV positive men history anal receptive intercourse attend several Toronto HIV clinic . Relevant information collect well anal specimen assessment . There multidisciplinary team appropriate expertise study . OUTCOME MEASURES STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : The primary outcome measure presence pre-cancerous change determine high resolution anoscopy . We need screen 425 subject order find 100 patient high grade pre-cancerous change . Secondary outcome analysis include specificity , positive predictive value negative predictive value cytology HPV DNA test detect histologically confirm pre-cancerous change cancer .</detailed_description>
