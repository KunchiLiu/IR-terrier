	<detailed_description>In previous cross sectional study group woman without breast cancer vary degree parenchymal density pattern , strong association demonstrate Transillumination Breast Spectroscopy ( TIBS ) x-ray derive mammographic density . From , expect TIBS also provide comparable odds ratio ( 4-6 ) mammographic density breast cancer risk show independent epidemiological study . It possible TIBS may provide complementary information high odds ratio compare incidence breast cancer . In contrast mammography derive parenchymal density pattern , historical TIBS data available retrospective analysis hence cross sectional study within group screen woman propose . We hypothesize TIBS provide physical information breast tissue use construct breast cancer risk predictor odd ratio &gt; 6 .</detailed_description>
