	<brief_summary>Aims : 1 ) To evaluate effectiveness two intervention aim improve management patient suspect pulmonary embolism : Written guideline Computer-Assisted Decision Support ( CADS ) . 2 ) To evaluate impact electronic reminder appropriateness treatment patient suspect PE Design : Pragmatic , unblinded , cluster randomise control study . Setting : 20 French Emergency Departments Patients : Out patient suspected pulmonary embolism Methods : Emergency physician prospectively complete standardize electronic form Personal Data Assistant ( PDA ) , include patient ' characteristic , clinical probability assess , diagnostic test perform , treatment initiate final diagnostic therapeutic decision . Patients interviewed end 3-month follow-up period use standardized questionnaire . The reference rate appropriateness diagnostic management intervention assess centre . At end preliminary period , centre randomize two fold two group accord factorial design stratification reference level appropriateness . Half centre write guideline half Computer-Assisted Decision Support diagnosis PE PDA . In two main group , half centre electronic reminder PDA concern treatment PE . Judgment criterion Main : Rate strategy consider validated accord result systematic review meta-analysis.3 Secondary judgment criterion ( diagnosis ) : - Rate strategy consider validate acceptable accord opinion international advisor . - Rate thromboembolic-events 3-month follow-up period patient pulmonary embolism rule - Costs diagnostic management Secondary judgment criterion ( treatment ) : - Delay Emergency Department admission first dose antithrombotic treatment patient high clinical probability PE accord Revised Geneva Score - Rate inappropriate treatment accord international recommendation patient confirm PE . Number patient : By estimate rate appropriateness would 55 % `` write guideline '' group , 1331 patient necessary highlight absolute superiority 15 % `` CADS '' group ( rate conformity 70 % ) . The number patient adjusted end preliminary period accord level appropriateness intervention consider improve less 5 % `` write guideline '' group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The management patient suspect pulmonary embolism ( PE ) represent important medical economic issue . In French Emergency Departments , 100 000 suspicion PE dealt per year . In previous work , find routine diagnostic practice differs large extent international guideline exclude PE basis inappropriate criterion expose patient six-fold increased risk venous thromboembolism 3-months follow-up.1 Passive intervention improve quality generally ineffective Computer-Assisted Decision Support reminder appear promising.2 Interventions : At end preliminary period , perform investigator , interactive oral presentation strategy consider validated basis systematic review meta-analysis.3 A strategy end exclude PE consider validated probability PE 5 % strategy end confirm PE consider validated probability PE upper 85 % . The strategy achieve criterion consider acceptable international advisor present well recommendation treatment PE.4 In group `` write guideline '' , emergency physician provide card present list validate acceptable strategy well Geneva diagnostic algorithm.5 The algorithm mention way follow appropriate diagnostic criterion . In `` CADS '' group , recommendation integrate electronic form allow calculation pre-test probability accord revise Geneva Score 6 , calculation post-test probability accord likelihood ratio test 3 contextualized reminder test perform stop investigation . In group `` treatment help '' , reminder concern treatment ( indication contraindication , dosage ) integrate electronic form PDA . 1 .
