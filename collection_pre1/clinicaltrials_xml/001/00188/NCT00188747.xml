	<brief_summary>Open-heart surgery frequently result abnormal clotting , turn result excessive blood loss need transfusion multiple blood product patient lead adverse outcome . Prompt identification clot abnormality cardiac surgery reduces blood loss blood product transfusion may improve outcome . Currently , however , monitor dependent standard laboratory-based test clot long turnaround time ( 30-45 min ) measure important aspect clotting . There monitor option carry patient â€™ bedside , provide result quickly standard laboratory test ( within 2-5 minute ) , measure aspect clotting , provide information possible cause abnormality . In study , compare cost-effectiveness two new monitoring technique standard laboratory-based test assign 150 patient undergoing open-heart surgery one three monitoring technique ( 50 patient assigned chance group ) . In group , explicit algorithm base monitoring technique group use guide transfusion decision . Between-group difference number unit blood product transfuse ( primary outcome ) , amount blood loss , rate adverse event , cost monitoring measure . The objective study determine three method cost-effective term outcome .</brief_summary>
