	<brief_summary>Several study show person systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) poor general health high risk heart attack bone loss ( osteoporosis ) compare general population . Some risk associate heart attack bone loss modifiable ( change ) . For example , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , smoking , lack exercise risk factor associate heart attack change . Whereas , age family history heart attack risk factor change . Similarly , diet low calcium , smoke lack exercise modifiable risk factor associate osteoporosis ; , family history age modifiable . The Health Improvement Prevention Program ( HIPP ) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus develop increase general health person lupus help reduce risk heart attack bone loss . This intervention program give comprehensive information lupus provide tool live good lupus . The program include visit nurse case manager work close collaboration lupus team . She work individual basis participant develop mutually agree upon personalize care plan aim improve general health , cop skill heart bone health . HIPP STUDY ( Health Improvement And Prevention Program ) Dr Paul Fortin Principal Investigator Primary Secondary objective : - To improve health status , decrease cardiovascular risk improve endothelial function person SLE compare usual care . - To improve bone health behavior prevent decrease bone mineral density . - To improve adherence treatment . - To help person Lupus move toward wellness increase knowledge . - To show HIPP cost effective could become standard care . Duration : 2 year Enrollment 240 patient Study Design : - Randomized prospective study HIPP compare usual care , patient cross Mth 12 . Data collect 24 mths . - Demographic , health status , cost , SLE knowledge , cop , cardiovascular osteoporosis information collect . - All patient undergo clinical evaluation measure disease activity , BMD ( every 2 year ) Flow mediate Doppler ( every year ) - HIPP patient attend 4 knowledge session , cover SLE , cop chronic disease , cardiovascular disease Lupus , bone health Lupus . - HIPP patient follow nurse coordinator receive individualize risk assessment , telephone follow-up , smoke cessation counseling . For find risk stress reduction ( Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ) bone health program provide . Hipp patient attend Cardiac Rehabilitation Program TWH . All HIPP pt attend Cardiac Rehabilitation program TWH .

	<brief_title>HIPP Learning Live Better With Lupus : The Health Improvement Prevention Program Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The survival rate Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) exceed 90 % 10 year health status severely impair comparable advanced cardiac respiratory disease . Since issue often overlook clinical practice SLE affect primarily young woman productive life , specific intervention need heighten health status coping , reduce complication cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) osteoporosis . Our primary goal demonstrate : 1- coordinated intervention , name Health Improvement Prevention Program ( HIPP ) , improve health status SLE compare usual care , 2- intervention decrease significantly number cardiovascular risk factor improve flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD - non-invasive measure endothelial health use surrogate marker CVD ) person SLE . Our secondary goal demonstrate HIPP : 1- improve bone health behavior prevent decrease bone mineral density ( BMD ) , 2- improve adherence treatment , 3- help person lupus move towards wellness illness-wellness continuum increase knowledge lupus , 4- show cost-effective intervention could become standard care SLE . Our population consist consecutive patient diagnosis SLE ( revised 1997 ACR criterion ) lupus clinic University Toronto McGill University . All without cardiovascular disease osteoporosis approach study . These two centre follow annually total close 700 person SLE offer standard HIPP service . Our study design randomize prospective study HIPP compare usual care . As believe HIPP superior usual care , crossover usual care group HIPP group 12 month . We collect information 24 month participant . The Health Improvement Prevention Program multidisciplinary intervention coordinate case manager nurse close collaboration lupus treat team . After provide consent , person fill demographic , health status , cost , SLE knowledge , cop , cardiovascular osteoporosis risk questionnaire undergo clinical evaluation measure lupus disease activity damage well FMD BMD . They randomize HIPP usual care 12 month usual care group cross HIPP . HIPP participant invite attend 4-week , 6 hour course cover follow four topic : 1 ) Knowledge SLE , 2 ) Coping Chronic Disease , 3 ) Cardiovascular Disease SLE 4 ) Bone Health SLE . Four six week entry HIPP , second visit case manager individualize program propose patient . For patient , include standardize CVD prevention program . For find risk baseline , also include stress-reduction and/or bone-health program . The case manager follow HIPP participant individually phone person accord need . Follow-up questionnaire health status , cost cop do phone 6 18 month ; repeat clinical assessment lupus activity damage , questionnaires FMD do 12 24 month ; BMD repeat 24 month . Power analysis . We need enroll 120 patient study ensure 80 % power detect least 10 % improvement SF-36 MCS PCS 20 % CVD risk reduction . Descriptive analysis , univariate multivariate analysis carry . For primary goal , test whether HIPP well usual care improve SF-36 MCS , PCS CVD risk profile . Our outcome change SF-36 MCS PCS score , FMD CVD risk assessment , predictive variable HIPP . We adjust age , gender , baseline SF-36 MCS PCS , depression score , education , lupus activity damage . Other secondary outcome analyse use similar model . Cost calculate cost-effectiveness analysis HIPP perform . Significance . A valid , cost-effective comprehensive program ameliorate health cop status prevent CVD osteoporosis would high impact long-term health quality life person SLE .</detailed_description>
