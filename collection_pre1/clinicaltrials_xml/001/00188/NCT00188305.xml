	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Cancer Risk Health Education Relatives Colorectal Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) second leading cause cancer death North America , despite refer preventable curable detect early . Early detection preventive screen find decrease CRC death . However , adherence CRC screening poor , average risk high risk individual . Lack knowledge CRC risk screen recommendation , psychological factor , perceive risk CRC cite important factor associate screen compliance . By increase knowledge appropriate risk comprehension , possible increase lifelong , long-term screening adherence , rather one-time compliance . This especially important CRC screening unpleasant individual clear risk important information CRC , may reluctant continue screen program . Having least one first-degree relative ( FDR ) CRC increase individual 's risk develop disease . Many relative CRC probands ineligible genetic testing , therefore , receive information healthcare provider disease . Providing relative CRC probands information risk develop CRC , screen information , CRC-related health information , may increase knowledge screen compliance show relative breast cancer patient . Previous educational intervention relative breast cancer probands demonstrate increased knowledge , screen behaviour , risk comprehension , decrease distress . While intervention effective relative breast cancer patient , intervention conduct date relative CRC patient . We believe relative CRC patient could also benefit type educational session . Educational intervention relatives breast cancer patient conduct in-person , however clinical genetic counseling , session conduct in-person telephone . Telephone counsel become widespread clinical service despite lack evidence support effectiveness compare in-person counseling . Preliminary study show telephone intervention increase participation screen program , study directly compare telephone in-person counseling . The primary aim study test efficacy two mode ( in-person vs. telephone ) provide risk counsel health promotion intervention relatives CRC probands measure knowledge CRC risk health-related factor , comprehension risk , understand screen recommendation intent adopt appropriate screen regimen . Participants randomize one three study arm ( in-person , telephone , control ) . An assessment pre- post- intervention conduct . In addition , longer-term follow-up carry two month one year follow intervention examine sustainability intervention effect .</detailed_description>
