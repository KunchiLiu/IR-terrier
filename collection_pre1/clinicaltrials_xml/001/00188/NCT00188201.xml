	<detailed_description>The current proposal address hypothesis neurocognitive neurochemical abnormality may occur individual HCV-infection liver cirrhosis vasculitic neuropathy , phenomenon may result direct effect HCV Central Nervous System ( CNS ) . Our hypothesis originate frequently report complaint forgetfulness decreased ability concentrate ( ` brain fog ' ) patient chronic HCV-infection , well clinical observation cognitive impairment moderate proportion non-cirrhotic HCV-infected patient . Patients HCV-infection also report significant impairment realm everyday function , great reduction quality life ( QOL ) individual infect Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . These result attribute degree liver inflammation , mode acquisition infection . Based well-established association neurocognitive function quality life , reasonable hypothesize QOL difference HCV HBV result cerebral compromise individual infect HCV , consequent neuropsychiatric neurocognitive dysfunction . Non-cirrhotic HCV-infected patient find impaired speed measure sustain attention work memory relative control subject . MRS result study suggested may also neurochemical change associate HCV observe even infected individual normal liver status ( determine biopsy ) . In particular , increase choline ratio , detect basal ganglion white matter . This pattern appear specific HCV-infection abnormality find patient Hepatitis-B infection . Furthermore , degree neurochemical abnormality correlate neuropsychological performance . Similar increase choline level report subcortical brain region individual infect HIV-1 , even prior onset symptomatic infection sign cognitive dysfunction . Rationale : Mechanism HCV may direct CNS effect A plausible mechanism direct CNS effect HCV involve passage virus brain tissue infection circulate lymphocyte . In fact , number study reveal presence HCV RNA-negative strand ( intermediate viral replication ) within peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PMBC ) . However , issue extra-hepatic replication PBMC remain controversial due contrary finding methodological criticism . However , recently Laskus colleague demonstrate presence HCV RNA-negative strand PBMC 40-60 % HCV-infected individual HIV-1 co-infection , separate investigation determine presence HCV RNA-negative strand monocytes/macrophages , CD4+ CD8+ lymphocytes , CD19+ cell HCV/HIV-1 co-infected individual . Thus , plausible HCV enters brain circulating lymphocyte , consequent neuropsychiatric , neurocognitive , neurochemical abnormality relate presence HCV CNS way yet understood . Corroborating hypothesis recent observation Thomas colleague ( personal communication ) HCV detect brain tissue infected individual upon neuropathological examination autopsy tissue . This propose mechanism direct CNS effect HCV-infection similar thought cause HIV-1 associate neurocognitive impaiiment . Early course HIV-1 epidemic come realization frequent neurological complication , include neuropsychiatric , neurocognitive , motor dysfunction . These symptom could attribute opportunistic infection CNS ( e.g . toxoplasmosis ; neoplasm ) , often progressed stage dementia , come know HIV-associated dementia ( HAD ) . The incidence HAD decline drastically subsequent advent antiretroviral treatment . HIV-1 think enter brain early course initial infection , possibly infection peripheral monocyte macrophage cross blood-brain barrier . In HAD , complex indirect mechanism CNS damage may occur year initial HIV-1 infection , usually condition immunocompromise . HIV-1 directly infect neuron , rather replicate within brain macrophage microglia . These cell subsequently become immunoactive , release secretory neurotoxic substance ultimately lead breakdown homeostatic mechanism , consequent cascade inflammatory event . The result metabolic encephalopathy damage , eventually destroy CNS neuron . The prominent neuropathological feature HAD occur white matter deep grey matter region brain , include myelin pallor , multinucleated giant cell , occasionally encephalitis characterize disseminate , multifocal microgranulomas compose elongated microglia , macrophage , lymphocyte . Thus , give preliminary finding extra-hepatic replication within PBMC plausible mechanism infiltration CNS HCV-infected lymphocyte , neuropathological detection HCV within CNS , clinical observation patient complaint cognitive deficit , reduction HRQOL beyond observed chronic HBV-infection , possible HCV may direct CNS effect elicit consequent inflammatory reaction interfere neuronal function manner similar neuropathological process associate HIV-1 infection . Furthermore , parallel MRS finding HIV-1 report HCV-infection non-cirrhotic patient . In particular , HIV-1 mark increase choline-containing compound ( Cho ) , similar preliminary finding Forton colleague ( 1999 ; 2000 ) . This increase subcortical Cho find HIV-1 positive patient even absence cognitive dysfunction , suggest may early marker CNS involvement . Other change , notably decrease N-acetylaspartate , apparent HIV-1 infected individual significant neuropsychological impairment , indicate evolution CNS disease . Of importance , antiretroviral therapy appear reverse Cho abnormality , also result significant improvement neurocognitive function . Objectives Phase I In first phase , determine whether non-cirrhotic individual chronic HCV-infection ( cryoglobulinemia ) manifest abnormality brain biochemistry neurocognitive performance . This accomplished compare HCV-infected individual subject HBV-infection ( control effect viral hepatitis ) , age-matched control group measure neurocognitive performance MRS careful screening rule presence condition may affect cognitive performance . We also determine whether relationship MRS-quantified brain biochemistry neurocognitive performance . Finally , reveal determinant neurocognitive impairment neurochemical abnormality use multivariate analysis , evaluate relative contribution clinical parameter associate HCV-infection , fatigue , mood / psychiatric symptom , serum aminotransferase level , degree fibrosis , viral load . Phase II In second phase investigation , determine whether HCV-infected patient achieve sustain virological response antiviral therapy ( HCV RNA detectable serum ) show amelioration cerebral metabolite abnormality cognitive impairment follow-up ( 6 month follow cessation treatment ) , compare patient respond antiviral treatment compare age-matched control group ( control subject tested Phase I investigation ) . In group respond treatment , MRS abnormalities remain unchanged , may worsen . A control group particularly important NP assessment aspect investigation , order account practice effect may result repeated administration NP test . Patients HBV-infection re-tested point , expect see abnormality group initial assessment point . In addition , HBV-infected patient start antiviral treatment follow liver biopsy , likely still receive treatment 1-5 year later . The rationale timing final assessment HCV patient 6 month cessation antiviral therapy involve know neuropsychiatric sequela treatment Interferon ( may otherwise affect cognitive assessment ) . Efficacy antiviral treatment HCV Interferon ribavirin At time submission , treatment IFNa2b plus ribavirin standard care patient chronic HCV-infection . However , recently publish data indicate interferon pegylated ( covalently bind polyethylene glycol ) , efficacy markedly enhance comparison standard IFNa2b plus ribavirin . Enhanced efficacy likely due sustain elevation IFN serum , due delay renal excretion . Thus , weekly ( rather three time weekly ) injection require . Pilot study data indicate efficacy pegylated IFN alfa-2a plus ribavirin even effective . This portion investigation add-on safety study involve treatment 6 12 month Pegylated Interferon alfa-2a plus ribabvirin ( UHN # 01-0082 ) . We expect rate sustain virological responder non-cirrhotic patient approximately 54 % . METHODS : Subjects - In total , 150 subject participate investigation , 100 assess two different occasion , approximately 1.5 year apart . Fifty patient chronic Hepatitis C infection ( HCV ) , fifty chronic Hepatitis B infection ( HBV ) , fifty healthy control subject recruit participate investigation . All participant undergo screen procedure rule condition affect cognitive function . Those deem eligible basis inclusion exclusion criterion participate first phase investigation assess Physical , Neurological , Psychiatric , Neuropsychological examination , well Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy . In second phase investigation , HCV patient control subject reassess interval 1.0 1.5 year determine whether antiviral treatment effective ameliorate neurocognitive brain biochemical abnormality identify first phase investigation . Materials : Assessments Procedures Screening Assessments Liver Biopsy All HCV BBV patient receive liver biopsy part clinical management eligible participate current investigation , although patient receive biopsy purpose investigation . Instead , participant recruit pool subject receive clinical care UHNTWH Liver Clinic recent liver biopsy perform , progress treatment ( HBV HCV patient ) . Laboratory Assessment HCV HBV patient undergo screen laboratory assessment consist hematological assessment , blood chemistry , urinalysis per protocol clinical trial investigation add ( UHN # 01-0082 ) . In addition , supplementary laboratory assessment conduct screen parameter may relate cognitive function . In particular , follow test perform : RBC/Folate , Hb Urea , Electrolytes , Bl2 , TSH , Cryoglobulins , INR , Albumin . Physical Evaluation All HCV HBV patient assess Principle Investigator clinical sign liver disease , also general physical examination specify clinical trial protocol ( UHN # 01-0082 ) . HBV patient assessed Principle Investigator similar manner . The result assessment use screen sign clinically significant liver disease ( e.g . stigma , asterixis , liver size , spleen size , jaundice , ascites edema , well condition relate liver disease could possibly affect cognition thus exclude participant participation investigation ( e.g . cryogloubulinemia ) . Neurological Examination : Patients examine study neurologist presence condition would result exclusion investigation . The neurologist also examine patient sign peripheral neuropathy could indicate presence cryoglobulinemia ( e.g . dysesthesia hypesthesia , motor weakness , exaggerated deep tendon reflex , positive pyramidal sign ) . In addition , neurological examination conduct final visit order determine whether neurological side effect know associated Interferon therapy persist beyond 6 month wash-out period . Psychiatric Examination : The patient examine study psychiatrist determine current lifetime presence psychiatric diagnosis could result exclusion investigation . Of specific concern psychiatric diagnosis could impact cognitive function ( e.g . Major Depression , Bipolar Disorder , Substance Abuse disorder , Antisocial Personality Disorder ) .</detailed_description>
