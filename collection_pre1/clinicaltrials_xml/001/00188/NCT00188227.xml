	<brief_title>Comparison Three Different Pain Anxiety Reducing Methods Adult Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow Puncture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The puncture bone marrow routine medical procedure often perform field hematology/oncology . When carefully appropriately perform , puncture bone marrow low rate complication generally safe patient . However , invasive painful procedure associate anxiety , especially patient undergo repeated puncture . Therefore appropriate preparation patient puncture essential order minimize stress experienced procedure . In regard , number pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention pedriatric patient aim reduce punction relate pain anxiety patient . Nevertheless evidence base approach pretreatment patient yet establish . The aim study investigate three different method reduce pain anxiety associate puncture bone marrow adult patient . Two investigated method involve pretreatment patient pharmacological agent ( sedative drug analgetic drug ) , whereas third method involve cognitive behavioural pretreatment form audio material . The patient control group receive placebo injection .</detailed_description>
