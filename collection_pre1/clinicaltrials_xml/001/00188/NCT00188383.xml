	<brief_summary>The primary aim determine whether perioperative NMDA-receptor antagonism differential effect postoperative pain , hyperalgesia morbidity young old patient . In order achieve aim , researcher propose conduct first randomize , double-blind placebo-controlled study design investigate age difference effect perioperative oral administration NMDA-receptor antagonist ( amantadine ) men undergo radical prostatectomy . In addition , age difference psychosocial factor pharmacological property amantadine morphine measure control , clarify , contribution difference find . The specific objective study : 1. investigate effect perioperative NMDA receptor blockade postoperative hyperalgesia , pain analgesic consumption young elderly men 2. assess age difference intensity course secondary hyperalgesia surgery</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The immediate postoperative period associate spontaneous pain hyperalgesia , i.e. , increase pain response ( intensity duration ) normally painful stimulus follow tissue injury damage . The development maintenance secondary hyperalgesia depend complex plastic change spinal cord dorsal horn cell peripheral injury damage . Afferent impulse signal damage carry dorsal horn slowly conducting , unmyelinated C-fibres . C-fibres release glutamate act three receptor type : metabotropic , kainate/AMPA NMDA . NMDA receptor activation , complex cascade intracellular event , result dorsal horn neuron hyperexcitability central sensitization . These cell increase spontaneous activity , decrease threshold , increased response afferent input , prolong afterdischarge repeat stimulation , expansion receptive field . Central sensitization express behaviorally secondary hyperalgesia contributes prolong postoperative pain . It also may trigger pathological reorganization neural circuitry lead development chronic postsurgical pain . Through process , tissue injury may profound effect CNS long outlast injury . In animal model pain , NMDA agonists induce central sensitization hyperalgesia whereas antagonist decrease prevent hyperalgesia . In human , NMDA-receptor antagonism decrease secondary hyperalgesia subsequent experimentally-induced pain . Perioperative administration NMDA antagonist , , , surgery , may ideal intervention block initiation maintenance central sensitization . Several study find intervention reduces postoperative hyperalgesia , pain , analgesic use ; however , others find effect . This surprising give variability across study factor surgical procedure , extent nature tissue damage , duration surgery , pharmacokinetics agent ( ) test , intraoperative postoperative analgesia . Nonetheless , weight evidence suggest prevent minimize central sensitization reduces pain analgesic requirement . Co-administration NMDA antagonists opioids advocate effective approach . The combination morphine amantadine reduce postoperative pain induce analgesia action opioid-mediated receptor system reduce hyperalgesia via NMDA receptor-mediated event . The combination also produce few opioid-related adverse effect due anticipate opioid-sparing effect . The present proposal describe first direct comparison perioperative NMDA receptor blockade couple intra- post-operative opioid administration young elderly patient . In order minimize influence perioperative factor outcome variable , patient undergo surgical procedure anesthetic protocol . Furthermore , factor readily standardize ( e.g. , surgical duration , mood ) measure control statistically . This increase internal validity propose study ability detect age drug effect .</detailed_description>
