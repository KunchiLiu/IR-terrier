	<brief_summary>The literature suggest may association hepatitis C type 2 diabetes mellitus independent presence cirrhosis , likely mechanism insulin resistance . The prevalence insulin resistance patient hepatitis C unknown . Furthermore , study indicate increase prevalence insulin resistance patient hepatitis C compare etiology liver disease . The role hepatitis C may development insulin resistance unclear . The effect antiviral therapy hepatitis C virus insulin resistance address . The long-term consequence insulin resistance type 2 diabetes mellitus . There significant morbidity mortality type 2 diabetes mellitus general population , similar complication would expect patient hepatitis C insulin resistance particularly develop type 2 diabetes mellitus . Our hypothesis : The prevalence insulin resistance increase patient chronic hepatitis C compare chronic hepatitis B. Secondarily , insulin resistance present patient chronic hepatitis C improve successful antiviral therapy . This study two phase . The first phase study estimate prevalence insulin resistance individual chronic hepatitis C without cirrhosis compare patient chronic hepatitis B without cirrhosis . The second phase study restrict patient hepatitis C find insulin resistant phase 1 , absence know risk factor insulin resistance ( cirrhosis , diabetes ) . The effect insulin resistance anti-viral therapy eradicate hepatitis C assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance Associated With Chronic Hepatitis C ( CHC ) Effect Antiviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first phase include patient hepatitis C candidate anti-viral treatment , patient chronic hepatitis B undergone recent liver biopsy show hepatitis without cirrhosis , equal number group ( 100/ group ) . Phase 2 ( 40 patient ) - Patients hepatitis C find phase 1 HOMA test increase insulin resistance recruit phase 2 ( interventional phase ) . Patients HBV infection study . The study conduct single center use open-label design . All patient treatment naïve . Up 40 patient treat per current standard care combination pegylated interferon alfa ribavirin ( Phase 2 ) . Patients genotype 2 3 treated combination weekly Pegasys daily Copegus dose 800 mg give 24 week ( Group A ) . Patients genotype non-2 3 treated combination weekly Pegasys daily Copegus dose 1000-1200 mg give 48 week ( Group B ) . Both group untreated follow-up period 24 week . Pegasys administer sc weekly ( 180 microg 0.5 1 mL solution ) Copegus take po daily split dose 400 mg morning 400 mg evening ( i.e. , 2 tablet 200 mg bid ) . For dos 1000 mg ( genotype non- 2 3 patient whose body weight &lt; 75 kg ) Copegus administer po daily : 400 mg ( i.e . 2 tablet 200 mg ) morning 600 mg ( i.e . 3 tablet 200 mg ) evening . For genotype non-2 3 patient whose body weight 75 kg , 600 mg ( i.e . 3 tablet 200 mg ) morning 600 mg ( i.e . 3 tablet 200 mg ) evening recommend . All patient study receive Copegus treatment food . By definition , Copegus “ food ” mean take dos within 1 hour 2 hour meal . The meal consider “ regular ” oppose “ fat-restricted ” . All 40 patient meet inclusion criterion also indices body fat assessed calculation BMI , DEXA scanning , waist-to-hip circumference measurement . Prior therapy patient undergo OGTT , dynamic test insulin resistance provide accurate information relationship insulin glucose . At week 12 treatment patient quantitative assessment HCV viral load second OGTT . The current standard therapy discontinue anti-viral therapy patient genotype 1 4 without ≥ 2-log fall HCV RNA . Those ≥ 2-log fall HCV RNA expect SVR . Patients continue anti-viral therapy follow SVR . Twenty-four week completion anti-viral therapy , OGTT repeat ( SVR OGTT ) . The effect viral clearance insulin resistance assess compare OGTT SVR ( SVR OGTT ) pre-treatment OGTT . Patients Non-Responders also assess safety 4-8 week last dose test medication follow premature discontinuation study . Non-Responders define patient without 2-log drop PCR baseline week 12 positive PCR last visit . Responders follow Week 48 ( Group A patient ) Week 72 ( Group B patient ) . Responders define patient 2-log drop PCR baseline week 12 negative PCR last visit . Female patient receive Copegus continue home-based pregnancy test every 4 week 6-month period last dose study drug . Efficacy assessment consist serum HCV-RNA via PCR . Quantitative viral titer ( AMPLICOR HCV MONITOR Test , v2.0 ) obtain Weeks 0 12 patient . Qualitative HCV-RNA result ( AMPLICORÒ HCV Test , v2.0 ) obtain treatment period Week 24 patient Week 48 group B ; addition follow-up week 24 patient . Insulin resistance determine OGTT method assess prior initiation therapy , 12 week therapy , follow-up week 24 patient . Study Outcome : Phase 1 - To evaluate prevalence insulin resistance patient hepatitis C without cirrhosis compare observe patient hepatitis B also without cirrhosis . Phase 2 - Interventional phase - To evaluate effect anti-viral therapy insulin resistance , determine OGTT method , patient hepatitis C find insulin resistance pre-treatment . - To evaluate safety , efficacy tolerability Pegasys ( peginterferon alfa-2a ) give combination Copegus ( ribavirin ) give 24 week 48 week treatment naïve patient chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) .</detailed_description>
