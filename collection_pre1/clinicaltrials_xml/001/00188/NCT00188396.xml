	<brief_summary>Objectives : This prospective investigation compare premenopausal , perimenopausal postmenopausal woman 's response antidepressant medication . The effect menstrual cycle symptom depression antidepressant response also examine . Hypotheses : Premenopausal woman show significantly good response selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) peri- postmenopausal woman . Premenopausal woman low estrogen phase menstrual cycle complain increase depressive symptom despite treatment . Perimenopausal postmenopausal woman irregular period generally low estrogen level show less symptom variability time . Method Subjects : Eighty-four woman ( 28 premenopausal , 28 perimenopausal , 28 postmenopausal ) meeting Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) criterion major depressive disorder enrol study . Procedure : All subject follow prospectively 12 week 2 menstrual cycle receive treatment standard SSRI antidepressant agent . All eligible woman structure clinical interview complete questionnaire assess depressive symptom . Blood sample collect evaluate reproductive hormone level late follicular , midluteal late luteal phase menstrual cycle two consecutive cycle . Serum SSRI level also collect time . As woman perimenopausal postmenopausal group either irregular menstrual cycle longer cycle , blood sample draw baseline 6 occasion . Research Implications : As majority psychiatric medication prescribe woman , understand interplay menstrual cycle antidepressant medication ultimately translate diverse improve patient care . The propose study one within develop research program , part guide study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : The lifetime prevalence depression twice high woman men ; robust frequently replicate finding cross national epidemiology study . Women also prone various depressive disorder certain stage life cycle yet etiologic mechanism therapeutic implication increase rate depression especially certain life stage remain largely unknown . The hormonal milieu appear independent impact occurrence depression potentially treatment response disparity sex emerge onset puberty persists age 55 . There accumulate evidence suggest differential antidepressant drug effect men woman recent preliminary evidence may differences treatment response woman age . Younger woman depression may responsive serotonergic antidepressant may relate change menstrual status estrogen level . Postmenopausal woman low estrogen level may lack enhance effect estrogen serotonergic mechanism , thus , may able achieve full therapeutic potential serotonergic antidepressant . The reported difference response rate premenopausal postmenopausal woman may relate presence absence menstrual cycle well lower estrogen level find postmenopausal woman although hypothesis formally test . A prospective study therefore propose primarily characterize rate response follow SSRI therapy depress woman meet criterion Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) treat current depressive episode . Menstrual status confirm base reproductive hormone level . Perimenopausal postmenopausal woman study separately different hormonal profile . All woman rate symptom depression daily basis addition , independent raters rate depressive symptom prospectively determine relationship change depressive symptom antidepressant response across menstrual cycle . All woman treat citalopram paroxetine secondary alternative . Objectives Primary objective : To compare reduction severity depression premenopausal , perimenopausal postmenopausal woman . Secondary objective : To assess symptom depression antidepressant response across menstrual cycle premenopausal woman comparison peri- postmenopausal woman . Exploratory objective : To examine relationship estrogen SSRI level across menstrual cycle . Hypotheses Primary hypothesis : The mean reduction HRSD score follow SSRI antidepressant therapy significantly high premenopausal compare peri-and postmenopausal woman . Secondary hypothesis : 1 . Depression score ( base HRSD Prospective Record Impact Severity Menstrual Symptoms [ PRISM ] calendar ) significantly high low estrogen phase menstrual cycle high estrogen phase premenopausal woman remain constant dos citalopram . 2 . The relationship discernable perimenopausal postmenopausal woman comparable time period comparable antidepressant treatment . Exploratory hypothesis : There positive correlation estrogen level SSRI level . Significance : This study take innovative approach increase understanding hormonal contribution symptom severity antidepressant treatment response . Since majority psychotropic medication prescribe woman , understand interactive process menstrual cycle antidepressant medication potential change clinical practice allow individualized pharmacological treatment within evidence base approach .</detailed_description>
