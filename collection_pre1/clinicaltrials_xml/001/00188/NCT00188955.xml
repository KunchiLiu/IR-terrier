	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Title Of Study : A Single Center , Prospective , Randomized , Controlled Study Of Two Chronic Immunosuppressive Protocols Using Sirolimus Or Mycophenolate Mofetil To Prevent Or Reverse Disease Progression In Pediatric Renal Transplants With Chronic Allograft Nephropathy Short Title : Winnipeg-CAN-1 Clinical Trial : Phase-IV Objectives : This prospective , randomize , control study evaluate effectiveness two different chronic immunosuppressive protocol treatment chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) child . One protocol continue standard immunosuppression include mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , substitute MMF sirolimus . The primary objective follow : · To evaluate effectiveness treatment sirolimus pediatric renal transplant recipient establish CAN compare MMF reduce rate progression CAN measure prospective histological evaluation sequential kidney biopsy use quantification interstitial fibrosis image analysis validate standardized scoring schema ( Banff 97 criterion ) . The secondary objective follow : - To evaluate effectiveness treatment sirolimus pediatric renal transplant recipient establish CAN compare MMF slow rate clinical deterioration associate progression CAN measure change serum creatinine correct glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) study period . - To analyze effect treatment sirolimus pediatric renal transplant recipient establish CAN compare MMF incidence late AR identify prospective histological evaluation sequential kidney biopsy . - To analyze effect treatment sirolimus pediatric renal transplant recipient establish CAN compare MMF incidence graft failure define return dialysis , re-transplantation death uremic complication . - To analyze difference expression molecular marker fibrosis pediatric renal transplant recipient establish CAN treat sirolimus compare MMF immunohistochemical identification extracellular matrix protein expression remodel quantification image analysis . Study Design : The study prospective , single-centre , randomize , control trial pediatric patient function kidney transplant biopsy-proven CAN . The study design compare efficacy two chronic immunosuppression regimen intend treatment CAN . Patients ( age 1-17 year ) CAN demonstrate protocol biopsy biopsy do clinical suspicion CAN , consider enrollment . Eligible patient enrol treatment randomize one two treatment group : Group A receive sirolimus combination low-dose tacrolimus prednisone ; Group B receive current local standard therapy , MMF , low-dose tacrolimus prednisone . All transplant care accord standard local practice . Study participant follow period 2 year , undergo protocol biopsy 1 2 year . The timing biopsy coincide already plan protocol biopsy . Clinical , laboratory histological data gather prospectively determine efficacy accord pre-defined criterion measure extent CAN interstitial fibrosis . Study visit coincide routine clinic visit , except weekly visit study onset titrate drug dose accord trough level . Blood urine test , blood pressure monitoring , time urine collection nuclear GFR testing perform accord normal clinical care protocol . Additional pharmacokinetic test occur 3 12 month . Participants enrol 2-year period follow accord study protocol 2 year . 40 patient enrol . Dosages , Route Dose Regimen : Patients randomize Group A receive initial oral load dose sirolimus 3 mg/m2 2 divide dos ( 1.5 mg/m2/dose bid ) study day 1 . Beginning study day 2 , patient receive 1mg/m2/day orally divide dos ( 0.5 mg/m2/dose ) every 12 hour . Therapeutic drug monitor 12-hour trough concentration perform week 1-4 , monthly first 3 month , least every 3 month , dose adjustment make order achieve 12-hour trough level 8 ng/ml 12 ng/ml . Patients randomize Group B continue receive MMF 1200 mg/m2/day orally divide dos ( 600 mg/m2/dose ) every 12 hour start Study Day 1 . Therapeutic drug monitor 12-hour trough concentration perform week 1-4 , monthly first 3 month , least every 3 month , dose adjustment make order achieve 12-hour trough mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) level 2.0 mg/ml 4.0 mg/ml . Safety Measurements : Safety determine monitor AEs , vital sign , laboratory parameter ( clinical chemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) follow-up period . In particular , sign symptom associate known medication side effect infection , malignancy , anemia ( sirolimus ) , thrombocytopenia ( sirolimus ) , hyperlipidemia ( sirolimus ) , leukopenia ( MMF ) GI effect ( MMF ) . Serial monitoring renal function indicate acute rejection drug toxicity , confirm biopsy . Primary Efficacy And Secondary Endpoints : Quantitative change CAN use determine efficacy . Protocol renal allograft biopsy perform 12 24 month study enrollment compare baseline histology obtain routine protocol surveillance biopsy screen period perform 1 , 3 , 6 12 month post-transplant , yearly thereafter . The amount CAN measure semi-quantitative score histological change characteristic CAN accord Banff 97 schema , interstitial fibrosis quantify use image analysis . Secondary endpoint include change renal function , proteinuria , rate acute rejection , graft survival , expression protein important interstitial matrix remodelling immunohistochemistry . Renal function monitor clinical visit compare baseline function duration study . In addition , quantitative assessment GFR correct body surface area obtain baseline , 1 2 year , nuclear GFR measurement . Proteinuria quantify 24-hour urine collection baseline every 6 month study spot protein : creatinine ratio . Statistical Analysis : Data express mean ± standard deviation . Quantitative TFR compare group use change TFR time ( DTFR ) percent change baseline ( % DTFR ) . The Student 's t-test use compare change group primary endpoint . One-way ANOVA use detect significant change multiple time-points , multiple ANOVA examine correlation interval variable . Multiple regression analysis use determine predictive value different , possibly independent quantitative variable . Non-parametric variable analyze use Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test , treatment difference time use Quade test . A difference &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
