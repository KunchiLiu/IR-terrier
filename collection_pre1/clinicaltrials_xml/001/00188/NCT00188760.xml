	<brief_title>Breast Study Investigating New Light Technique Monitor Changes Breast Tissue Density</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast density establish physical risk factor breast cancer , applicable entire female population pre-breast-screening program , unlike risk factor , show affected intervention treatment . High breast tissue density associate increase risk breast cancer . Transillumination Breast Spectroscopy ( TIBS ) use white light provide spectral information breast tissue density composition ( e.g . water , lipid , hemoglobin biomolecules ) . The overall goal TIBS program develop technique identify individual high risk breast cancer would benefit improved screening method risk reduce intervention ( e.g . diet lifestyle change ) monitor efficacy risk reduce intervention individual . In previous study , demonstrate high correlation breast density assess TIBS density identify x-ray mammography . The current study test TIBS ability monitor change individual 's breast density time</detailed_description>
