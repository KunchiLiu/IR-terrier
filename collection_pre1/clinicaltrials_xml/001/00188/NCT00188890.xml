	<brief_summary>Occupational exposure asbestos know increase risk develop cancer lung ( bronchogenic carcinoma ) pleura ( mesothelioma ) . Symptoms subtle non-specific , diagnosis often late prognosis consequently dismal . Currently accept non-invasive tool early diagnosis mesothelioma lung cancer asbestos-exposed subject . In last decade , low-dose compute tomography ( LDCT ) successfully develop validate early diagnosis lung cancer high-risk smoker . Malignant mesothelioma might , early stage , resemble benign pleural plaque , common find asbestos exposure . We target develop low-dose CT tool serially image pleural plaque , quantify individual overall volume , compute growth rate time , , , identify presence mesothelioma early , symptom occur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Purpose : Asbestos exposure may result several different disease lung line lung , so-called pleura . Mostly benign , two common malignant disease people prior asbestos exposure , so-called mesothelioma - originate pleura - cancer lung . Symptoms malignant disease generally appear 10-35 year first asbestos exposure , include shortness breath , chronic new cough , cough blood , chest pain weight loss . Unfortunately , symptom often cause advanced disease , patient longer cure . Currently accept tool early diagnosis mesothelioma lung cancer asbestos-exposed subject available . Standard care include regular chest radiograph , sufficient show mesothelioma lung cancer early stage . A screening CT examination , also call CAT scan , lung perform without intravenous contrast . The CT examination experimental procedure , CAT scan perform routinely since decade . However , particular case , albeit standard examination perform purpose research , part standard care . The screen CT examination lung take less 10-20 minute perform . If abnormality find initial examination , examine one repeat screen CT chest one year . If pleural plaque nodule lung see baseline CT , lead testing . Quite likely ( approximately 1 3 chance ) , invite follow-up CT 3 6 month . Further investigation choose accord standard care explain time . These coordinated physician Dr. Marc de Perrot , Department Thoracic Surgery . Secondly , evidence type cancer cancer prostate ovary , analysis blood may reveal protein marker indicate presence cancer body . A companion blood analysis study undertaken effort discover marker lung cancer mesothelioma , accuracy CT-scan diagnosis lung cancer may improve . Both time baseline screen CT annual follow-up screening CT , ask provide 5 ml ( approximately 2 teaspoon full ) blood sample needle stick . A blood-taking technician employ University Health Network certify nurse carry procedure . Purpose study search blood so-called `` marker '' , substances blood indicate cancer lung pleura . Most marker still development , thus blood store analyzed future date .</detailed_description>
