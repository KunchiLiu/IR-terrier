	<brief_summary>Brain metastasis occur cancer cell initial tumour site ( example , lung breast ) spread brain . This develop approximately 10 % - 30 % adults cancer . They produce different complaint related effect brain functioning , decrease person 's ability carry usual activity , reduction quality life shorten life expectancy . The standard treatment particularly people one brain metastasis consist palliative radiation therapy brain steroid . Steroids ( Decadron Dexamethasone ) medication use reduce swell around tumour , thus symptom improve . Steroids could helpful number potential side effect , particularly use long period time . There standard dose Decadron use treat brain metastasis patient . The commonly dose used 4 mg four times/day . This study assess low dos Decadron - 8 mg every morning symptomatic patient 4 mg every morning asymptomatic patient - effective maintain symptom control patient brain metastasis , without neurological deterioration necessitates patient go back high dose time . This information help also understanding decrease side effect associate high dos steroids people condition .</brief_summary>
