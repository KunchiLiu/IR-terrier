	<brief_summary>The standard treatment nasopharyngeal cancer involve either radiation alone radiation plus chemotherapy . Before start treatment , patient require imaging scan ass extent disease . The commonly used test magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . The goal study examine value new image technology recently become available University Health Network Hospitals call Positron Emission Tomography scanning ( PET ) . PET scan involves inject small amount drug vein arm call 18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18FDG ) . This drug special radioactive detect PET machine . Cancer cell believe active normal cell high rate metabolism . Therefore , cancer cell think take glucose ( kind sugar ) faster normal cell body . Because 18FDG modify type glucose , also take cancer cell . Special image camera able visualize area uptake reveal site cancer involvement . The main goal study evaluate whteher scan able detect presence nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) treatment specifically compare finding magnetic resonance imaging scan ( MRI ) . In addition PET scan , ask patient blood sample draw throughout treatment follow-up , research test call Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) DNA level . The Epstein Barr virus think role development nasopharyngeal cancer , many patient nasopharyngeal carcinoma find high level EBV DNA level blood . The second goal study evaluate whether change EBV DNA level associate treatment disease course nasopharyngeal cancer , whether help predict change cancer . This part study involve sample small amount venous blood time prior begin therapy regular interval follow treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography Scanning Epstein-Barr Virus DNA Levels Staging Follow-up Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Patients nasopharyngeal carcinoma stag accord 2002 American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) criterion . MRI image modality choice stag follow-up nasopharyngeal carcinoma . The goal conduct pilot study compare stag finding MRI PET scan pre- post-therapy patient . The end point document degree concordance two modality respect anatomic location volume disease time initial stag follow determine difference observe may alter stag management include radiation planning . We hypothesize PET scan able detect recurrence residual disease within radiate tissue earlier MRI . 2 . Nasopharyngeal carcinoma associate elevated titer Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) cell free , plasma DNA . Fluctuation i.e . - elevation EBV DNA level follow therapy may serve potential marker recurrent residual disease . We believe change EBV DNA titer precedes change conventional MRI possibly PET scan patient recurrent disease . We also predict , due sensitivity , EBV titer level sensitive evaluation tumor response therapy , well predict tumor recurrence . The second goal conduct trial compare sensitivity MRI , PET EBV titer assessment recurrent disease .</detailed_description>
