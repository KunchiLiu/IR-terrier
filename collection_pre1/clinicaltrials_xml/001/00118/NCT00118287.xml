	<brief_title>Azacitidine Etanercept Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine frequency hematologic responses patient MDS 5-aza ( azacitidine ) plus etanercept . II . Determine efficacy 5-aza combined etanercept patient low intermediate ( int ) -1 risk fail respond anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) plus etanercept purpose trial consider progressive `` advanced '' disease . III . Correlate result ex vivo/in vitro study phenotypic , cytogenetic functional disease characteristic vivo treatment response , identify parameter associate high probability response . OUTLINE : Patients receive etanercept subcutaneously ( SC ) twice weekly week 1 2 azacitidine SC intravenously ( IV ) 10-40 minute day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 3 course . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
