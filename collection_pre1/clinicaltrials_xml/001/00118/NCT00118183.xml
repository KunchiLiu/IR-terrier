	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give docetaxel together either cetuximab bortezomib work first-line therapy treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some find tumor cell kill carry tumor-killing substance . Others interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving docetaxel together either cetuximab bortezomib may effective first-line therapy treat non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel With Either Cetuximab Bortezomib First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) , define time study entry disease progression death , two combination regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate regimen . II . To evaluate overall survival distribution associate regimen . III . To evaluate toxicity regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond stable disease 4 course receive cetuximab alone absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel arm I bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond stable disease 4 course receive bortezomib alone absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 1 year , every 2 month 2 year , every 4 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 62 patient ( 31 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 6-11 month .</detailed_description>
