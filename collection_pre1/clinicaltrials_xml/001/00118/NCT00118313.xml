	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Biological therapy , imiquimod , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Giving vaccine therapy together imiquimod surgery may help body kill remain tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase I trial study side effect best way give vaccine therapy without imiquimod treat patient undergone surgery stage II , stage III , stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Imiquimod Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety adjuvant transdermal vaccine therapy comprise multi-epitope melanoma peptide ( MP ) , tetanus toxoid helper peptide ( TET ) , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) combination Montanide ISA-51 dimethyl sulfoxide without imiquimod patient undergone surgical resection stage II-IV melanoma . - Determine , preliminarily , immunogenicity regimens patient . - Correlate , preliminarily , transdermal administration vaccine recruitment maturation epidermal Langerhans cell patient . - Determine , preliminarily , effect time subsequent vaccine therapy comprise MP , TET , GM-CSF emulsify Montanide ISA-51 , administer intradermally subcutaneously , persistence immune response patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label study . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive vaccine therapy comprise multi-epitope melanoma peptide ( MP ) , tetanus toxoid helper peptide ( TET ) , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) emulsify Montanide ISA-51 transdermally ( TD ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients receive vaccine intradermally ( ID ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 29 , 50 , 71 , 92 , 113 , 134 . - Arm II : Patients receive vaccine therapy arm I . Patients also receive imiquimod topically day 0 , 7 , 14 . - Arm III : Patients receive vaccine therapy comprise MP , TET , GM-CSF , dimethyl sulfoxide TD day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients receive vaccine therapy comprise MP , TET , GM-CSF emulsify Montanide ISA-51 ID SC day 29 , 50 , 71 , 92 , 113 , 134 . - Arm IV : Patients receive vaccine therapy arm III imiquimod arm II . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 5 week disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 26 patient ( approximately 6 per treatment arm ) accrue study within approximately 2 year .</detailed_description>
