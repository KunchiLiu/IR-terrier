	<brief_summary>SUMMARY Background : Malaria lead cause morbidity mortality among pregnant woman Uganda . Although effective tool prevention control malaria exist , delivery present problem . Intermittent presumptive treatment ( IPT ) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) effective , yet &gt; 60 % woman Uganda get &lt; 40 % , attend antenatal care . Effective way deliver IPT SP pregnant woman community level need develop . This study assess whether community base resource person like traditional birth attendant ( TBAs ) , community reproductive health worker ( CRHWs ) , adolescent peer mobilizers ( APMs ) drug-shop owner ( DSV ) distribute IPT SP pregnant woman . Objectives : The objective study : - To assess community base approach deliver malaria prevention pregnant woman Uganda ; - To assess community perception , belief practice associate malaria treatment prevention pregnancy ; - To assess whether community base resource person deliver IPT pregnant woman reach risk ; - To assess impact IPT anaemia pregnancy outcome ; - To estimate cost-effectiveness approach assess acceptability sustainability approach . Methods : The study conduct 5 sub-counties Mukono district , situate shore L. Victoria Central Uganda . The district hyper-endemic malaria . 25 parish total population 75,000 people use test new approach . Phase 1 obtained qualitative data community perception , belief practice associate malaria prevention pregnancy . Phase 2 intervention study assess distribution IPT pregnant woman TBAs , CRHWs , APMs DSVs compare health unit . Pregnant woman parity enrol . Key resource person parish identify sensitise community intervention . Data collect regarding : timing first dose SP , proportion woman complete two dos SP , birth weight baby , proportion low birth-weight baby , proportion adolescent pregnancy . The third phase study evaluate sustainability approach . Work Plan : The first phase study take two month . The second phase take 14-16 month . Data analysis expect take 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Approach Deliver Malaria Preventions Pregnant Women Community Level Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY : The objective study : - To assess new community base approach deliver malaria prevention pregnant woman Uganda ; - To assess community perception , belief practice associate malaria treatment prevention pregnancy ; - To assess whether TBAs , CRHWs , APMs DSVs administer IPT SP pregnant woman community level ; - To assess whether TBAs , CRHWs , APMs DSVs reach woman risk malaria pregnancy ; - To evaluate impact community base distribution IPT SP anaemia pregnancy birth outcome ; - To assess acceptability sustainability deliver IPT SP pregnant woman community level ; - To estimate cost-effectiveness new community base approach deliver malaria prevention intervention pregnant woman . The study conduct Mukono district , Central Region , Uganda . The district situate 50-150kms east Kampala . The district estimate population size 1,128,500 . The district lie altitudes 1,158m 1,219m bordered Kayunga district North Lake Victoria South . It high temperature heavy rainfall month March May October November . The district divide 6 county , 28 sub-counties 145 parish . A sub-county usually population 30,000 people parish approximately 3,000 people . The Baganda majority tribe district . Other tribes include : Basoga , Badama , Banyole , Banyarwanda , Barundi , Balulu , Lugbar Jaluos . There high fertility rate , 7.2 birth per woman annual population growth rate 2.3 % . The district hyper- holoendemic malaria . The population serve 4 hospital , 5 health centre IV , 23 health centre III 25 health centre II . There numerous drug-shops , TBAs , private midwife CHRWs provide health care district . Drug shop license registered District Health Office . Five rural sub-counties lake- shore region level malaria transmission select . Within sub-county , 5 parish select base : availability health centre II , III IV , train TBAs , DSVs , CRHWs APMs . Study Population : The study population include pregnant woman live study area . PHASE ONE : Meetings discussion hold civic leader , woman leader , community resource person study area present study solicit consent community opinion leader . A formative study carry explore community ' idea approach deliver malaria prevention ass perception , belief practice associate malaria prevention pregnancy . Focus group discussion ( FGDs ) in-depth interview target pregnant woman , opinion leader , men woman different age group conduct sub-county . FGDs 6-7 participant within age range sex . In-depth interview hold DSVs , TBAs , opinion leader , traditional healer , CRHWs , APMs health worker sub-county . A survey conduct 25 parish get register number woman reproductive age group number woman currently pregnant . The total population 25 parish approximately 75,000 people 43 % reproductive age group . Pregnant woman give card personal identification number ( PINs ) GPS map construct easy tracking . PHASE TWO : An intervention study test community base approach deliver IPT SP pregnant woman conduct . The study four delivery approach : TBAs , DSVs , CRHWs APMs train give two dose regimen SP pregnant woman . These approach compare routine service health centre II IV . The intervention couple community mobilisation sensitisation ensure woman inform intervention . Information material poster distribute study area indicate benefit malaria prevention get SP . All pregnant woman visit DSVs , TBAs , CRHWs , APMs health centre consent participate study recruit give IPT SP second third trimester . Baseline data obtain Hb level , parasitaemia , history previous illness , obstetric history socio-demographic data . Appointments make pregnant woman blood sample take investigation receive first dose SP . TBAs , CRHWs , APMs DSVs train keep appropriate calendar schedule visit second dose SP . Pregnant woman receive health education , iron folic acid supplementation , de-worming information proper nutrition . All pregnant woman use card PIN number identification wherever go get care . The woman encourage deliver health unit . TBAs , CRHWs , APMs DSVs supply baby weigh scale baby deliver home ( within 5 day delivery ) . Pregnant woman history allergy sulphonamide contain drug exclude . Women consent participate told necessity take blood sample check Hb level malaria parasite . Local laboratory assistant hire , train supervised quality control . Women give appointment visit laboratory assistant go laboratory study area . Two blood sample take , one recruitment another 36 week gestation . Outcome variable : - Timing first dose SP . - Proportion woman complete two dos SP . - Birth weight baby . - Proportion low birth-weight baby . - Maternal Hb malaria parasite count . - Proportion adolescent pregnancy enrol . - Proportion pregnant woman agree take part study . - Proportion schedule visit complete delivery approach . - The cost per low birth weight baby avoid . - The cost per anaemic pregnant woman avoid . - Mothers ' perception four different SP delivery outlet . The sample size calculation base Pockock , 1983 three outcome variable use : Hb level 11.0 gm/dl , standard deviation ( SD ) 1.5 gm/dl ; mean birth weight 3000gms , SD 500gms ; proportion woman take malaria prophylaxis Uganda , currently estimate 34 % . To detect difference Hb 0.5 gm/dl , birth weight 150gms change 12 % proportion woman use malaria prophylaxis ; control delivery approach study , sample size require 170 , 211 , 310 three variable respectively , allow 20 % loss follow . For study , sample size 310 take arm give total sample size 1,550 . Cost component intervention study : For approach attempt make collect information societal point view cost could include irrespective pay . The approach incur cost fall three main category : patient related cost , supplier cost health facility base cost . Patient related cost due malaria illness pregnancy collect part overall intervention study . A questionnaire developed capture cost bear pregnant woman family result malaria relate morbidity ( e.g . number visit health centre hospital seek ANC well treatment malaria illness , transport cost , transport time , number SP pill consume , time lose pregnant woman due malaria illness time lose family member provide care . The questionnaire administer woman immediately birth . Supplier cost refer cost enable TBAs , DSVs , CHRWs APMs distribute SP ( e.g . training cost supplier well delivery cost ) . Interviews TBAs , CRHWs APMs conduct assess time spend average per week distributing SP . The total number SP tablet distribute record . Regarding health facility base cost , patient questionnaire identify average number health facility visit per pregnant woman ANC malaria relate morbidity . Two hospital six health centre randomly select study area visit collect relevant cost information . Bottom-up cost used estimate cost patient specific input drug prescribe laboratory test take individual patient . This do hospital review sample malaria patient note health centre examination sample OPD card malaria patient . All remain cost determine utilizing standard step-down costing . As main measure effect , number low birth weight baby per pregnancy avoid number anaemic woman per pregnancy avoid use . PHASE THREE : Following intervention study , data collect sample woman participate study community resource person get view sustainability delivery system . This qualitative study use FGDs in-depth interview . DATA GENERATED BY THE STUDY : The formative study generate qualitative data perception , belief practice associate malaria prevention pregnancy ; data cost intervention ; data acceptability sustainability community base approach . DATA ANALYSIS : After complete validate field form , data double data enter validated use EPINFO version 6.0 . Analysis do use SPSS PC Windows Version 10 . Descriptive statistic compute . Analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use compare difference mean . Logistic regression analysis use identify factor associate access , utilisation impact malaria prevention intervention . Qualitative data analyse thematically explain finding help interpretation quantitative result . DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS : The result disseminate national level policy maker , program manager scientific community Uganda . Dissemination take place within study district participate community . Data publish peer-reviewed journal . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS : The research proposal submit Ethics Committee Denmark Uganda National Council Science Technology approval . Informed consent ( verbal ) obtain pregnant woman participate intervention . Consent obtain community leader , woman opinion leader . Sterile needle syrinx use draw blood . The woman inform laboratory examination result . Women receive explanation follow issue : advantage disadvantage intervention ; possible adverse effect use SP pregnancy . An explanation give woman free withdraw epidemiological study time access SP wish . All malaria case diseases arose pregnancy treat referral complicate case make .</detailed_description>
