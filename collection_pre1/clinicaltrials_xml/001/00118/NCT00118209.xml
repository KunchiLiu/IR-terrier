	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving rituximab together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell . It yet know combination chemotherapy regimen effective give rituximab treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study rituximab give together two different combination chemotherapy regimens compare well work treat patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . Primary Objectives : 1 . To compare event-free survival R-CHOP versus DA-EPOCH-R chemotherapy untreated CD20+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 2 . To develop molecular predictor outcome R-CHOP DA-EPOCH-R chemotherapy use molecular profile 2 . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To compare response rate , overall survival toxicity R-CHOP versus DA-EPOCH-R 2 . To define pharmacogenomics untreated DLBCL correlate clinical parameter ( toxicity , response , survival outcome laboratory result ) molecular profile 3 . To assess use molecular profile pathological diagnosis 4 . To identify new therapeutic target use molecular profile 5 . To perform comprehensive analysis somatic alteration tumor genome understand genomic alteration somatically acquire tumor encode germ line patient 6 . To identify biomarkers response chemotherapy FDG-PET/CT imaging predictive histopathologic remission survival patient stage I ( mediastinal ) , II , III , IV untreated DLBCL 7 . To evaluate use semiquantitative measurement FDG uptake define FDG-PET/CT base biomarkers response chemotherapy patient DLBCL 8 . To determine whether FDG-PET/CT measurement tumor response second cycle chemotherapy predict clinical response 9 . To establish standardize protocol FDG-PET/CT image acquisition 10 . To determine additional FDG-PET/CT parameter ( e.g. , ratio tumor SUVmax liver SUVmean ; SUVs correct body surface area lean body mass ; nuclear medicine physician 's assessment ) evaluate utility refine FDG-PET/CT base biomarkers response therapy 11 . To evaluate inter-institutional reproducibility FDG-PET/CT measurement indication After patient complete treatment study , patient ask return clinic follow-up exam every three month first two year , every six month thereafter three year . A total five year study registration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically document de novo CD20+ DLBCL stage II , III IV disease . Stage I primary mediastinal ( thymic ) DLBCL also eligible . Patients underlie lowgrade lymphoma , transform lymphoma lowgrade lymphoma bone marrow , eligible . Diagnosis base adequate tissue sample , include open biopsy core needle biopsy . Needle aspiration primary diagnosis unacceptable . Patients must one follow WHO classification subtypes : Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma ( include morphological variant : centroblastic , immunoblastic , Tcell/histiocyte rich , anaplastic ) Mediastinal ( thymic ) large Bcell lymphoma Intravascular large Bcell lymphoma Note : Failure submit pathology block within 60 day patient registration consider major protocol violation . Fresh ( frozen ) tumor biopsy must available attempt . A frozen tumor biopsy equivalent minimum four least 16 gauge needle core important component study . Patients without adequate frozen material biopsy perform obtain material . If biopsy perform yield adequate material , patient still eligible study . If biopsy do safely , patient may still eligible study permission grant . Note : This study allow concurrent radiation unless patient document CNS treatment failure systemic failure . 2 . No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy rituximab . Patients may enter receive prior limited field radiation therapy short course glucocorticoid ( &lt; 10 day ) urgent local disease complication diagnosis ( e.g. , cord compression , SVC syndrome ) . Patients receive chemotherapy prior malignancy eligible . 3 . Age ≥ 18 year 4 . ECOG Performance Status 02 5 . No active ischemic heart disease congestive heart failure . If suspicion cardiac disease , cardiac ejection fraction must show LVEF &gt; 45 % , study require 6 . No known lymphomatous involvement CNS . A lumbar puncture prior study require absence neurological symptom 7 . No known HIV disease . Patients history intravenous drug abuse behavior associate increase risk HIV infection test exposure HIV virus . Patients test positive know infected eligible . 8 . Non pregnant nonnursing . Treatment would expose unborn child significant risk . Women men reproductive potential agree use effective form contraception . 9 . Patients active medical process ( e.g. , uncontrolled bacterial viral infection , bleed ) relate lymphoma exclude . 10 . Required Initial Laboratory Values ( unless nonHodgkin lymphoma ) : ANC ≥ 1000/μL Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL Creatinine≤ 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance ≥ 50 cc/min Total Bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL ( unless history Gilbert 's Disease )</criteria>
