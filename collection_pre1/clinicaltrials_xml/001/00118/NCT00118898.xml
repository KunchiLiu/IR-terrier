	<brief_summary>Currently , prefer anti-HIV regimen use United States consist two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) efavirenz ( EFV ) . However , new anti-HIV drug approve , alternative regimen need test determine new drug combination increase effectiveness treat HIV . The purpose study test safety , tolerability , effectiveness four different regimen HIV-infected adult never take anti-HIV drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efavirenz Atazanavir/Ritonavir Given With Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Abacavir/Lamivudine HIV Infected Treatment-Naive Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral ( ARV ) treatment regimens consist EFV two NRTIs commonly prescribe regimens initial therapy HIV-infected people United States . Such regimen popular drug easy administer , overall excellent efficacy , well tolerate . However , concern long-term drug toxicity , development drug resistance , potential complication pregnant woman , imperative drug combination investigate possible alternative initial regimen . Drugs recently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) HIV treatment include protease inhibitor ( PI ) atazanavir ( ATV ) two NRTI coformulations emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) abacavir/lamivudine ( ABC/3TC ) . Data limit efficacy new drug part anti-HIV drug regimen . This study evaluate compare safety , tolerability , efficacy four different treatment regimens HIV-infected treatment-naive adult . The treatment portion study last 96 week last participant enrol . Participants randomly assign one four arm : - Arm 1 participant receive EFV , FTC/TDF , placebo ABC/3TC . - Arm 2 participant receive EFV , ABC/3TC , placebo FTC/TDF . - Arm 3 participant receive ritonavir ( RTV ) -boosted ATV , FTC/TDF , placebo ABC/3TC . - Arm 4 participant receive RTV-boosted ATV , ABC/3TC placebo FTC/TDF . NOTE : Lopinavir/ritonavir may use substitution drug certain participant . Study visit occur study entry ; Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 ; every 12 week thereafter . A physical exam , blood collection , urine collection occur visit . Two pharmacokinetic blood sample collect participant Weeks 4 24 . Participants undergo adherence training study entry ask complete adherence questionnaire select study visit . Some participant ask participate ACTG A5224s , metabolic substudy ACTG A5202 . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) A5202 meet January 2008 review study . After review study information , DSMB note certain study regimens significantly less effective others . Specifically , ABC/3TC-containing regimens effective control virus TDF/FTC-containing regimens participant enter study high viral load . The DSMB also comment participant assign ABC/3TC short time experienced side effect participant assign TDF/FTC . The DSMB safety concern drug comparison . Based DSMB review , Feb 2008 participant start study high viral load tell whether take ABC/3TC TDF/FTC offer option continue change NRTI study drug component , discussion doctor . For participant start study lower screen viral load , study treatment continue without change . For 74 participant reason first treatment modification `` unblinded switched '' consequence DSMB result ( 33 EFV , ABC/3TC , placebo FTC/TDF arm ; 1 RTV-boosted ATV , FTC/TDF , placebo ABC/3TC arm ; 40 RTV-boosted ATV , ABC/3TC , placebo FTC/TDF arm ) .</detailed_description>

Known allergy/sensitivity study drug formulation Active alcohol drug use , opinion investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement Serious illness require systemic treatment hospitalization . Patients complete therapy clinically stable therapy least 7 day prior study entry exclude . Known clinically relevant cardiac conduction system disease Requirement current medication prohibit study treatment . Evidence major drug resistanceassociated mutation genotype evidence significant resistance phenotype perform time prior study entry . Current imprisonment involuntary incarceration psychiatric physical ( e.g. , infectious disease ) illness Breastfeeding . Women become pregnant study unblinded require permanently discontinue study regimen .</criteria>
