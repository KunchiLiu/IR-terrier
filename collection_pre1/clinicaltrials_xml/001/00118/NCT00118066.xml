	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming , grow , come back . The use calcitriol may prevent prostate cancer . It yet know whether calcitriol effective observation prevent prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well calcitriol work prevent prostate cancer patient prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcitriol Preventing Prostate Cancer Patients With Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine effect calcitriol patient high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine effect drug prostate specific antigen patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral calcitriol daily 8 week . Treatment repeat every 8 week 2 course absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion course 2 ( week 16 ) , patient undergo biopsy . Patients continue receive calcitriol 3 additional week biopsy evaluate . Patients persistent high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( HGPIN ) biopsy receive 2 additional course calcitriol . Patients HGPIN prostate cancer biopsy remove study . - Arm II : Patients undergo observation 16 week . At week 16 , patient undergo biopsy . Patients persistent HGPIN biopsy receive 2 course calcitriol arm I . Patients HGPIN prostate cancer biopsy remove study . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient ( 25 per arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
