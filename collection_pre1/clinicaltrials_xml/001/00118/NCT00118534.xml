	<brief_summary>The primary study objective conduct prospective , randomize control clinical trial compare effectiveness two approach deliver smoke cessation treatment veteran posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . An approach smoke cessation treatment integrate mental health care PTSD deliver mental health provider ( experimental condition ) compare specialized smoking cessation clinic referral ( VA 's usual standard care ) . Secondary study objective ( ) compare cost outcome cost-effectiveness IC versus USC , ( b ) identify treatment process variable explain ( mediate ) observe difference smoke abstinence rate two study condition , ( c ) determine whether cessation smoking associate worsening symptom PTSD and/or depression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrating Clinical Practice Guidelines Smoking Cessation Into Mental Health Care Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention : The research test effectiveness integrate evidence-based , efficacious treatment tobacco use disorder mental health care patient chronic PTSD . Two different method deliver smoke cessation treatment compare randomize , control clinical effectiveness trial conduct four Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) medical center . Smokers undergo mental health care PTSD want quit smoking randomly assign either ( 1 ) guideline-concordant smoke cessation treatment integrate within ongoing mental health care PTSD , deliver mental health provider ( Integrated Care ( IC ) , experimental condition ) , ( 2 ) specialize smoke cessation treatment , deliver separately PTSD treatment smoke cessation clinic ( Usual Standard Care ( USC ) , comparison condition ) . Primary Hypothesis : IC effective USC measure smoking-related clinical outcome . Secondary Hypothesis : The following treatment process variable predict smoke abstinence 12-months post randomization : ( ) number smoke cessation treatment session receive , ( b ) type duration protocol medication prescribe provider ( bupropion , transdermal nicotine patch , nicotine gum ) , ( c ) degree subject ' compliance prescribe protocol medication , ( ) number quit attempt mark abstinence 7 day . Treatment process variable predict smoke abstinence present significantly great degree IC USC . Primary Outcomes : The primary outcome measure point-prevalence smoking abstinence self-report 7 day prior assessment , obtain month 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 follow randomization study condition . Verification smoke abstinence obtain CO reading ( abstinence &lt; 10 ppm ) obtain assessment interval . Salivary cotinine level ( abstinence &lt; 20 ng/ml ) measure verify abstinence month 9 12 , subject may still use nicotine replacement medicine earlier assessment interval , confound cotinine assay . Study Abstract : Individuals posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) far likely smoke without mental illness smoke heavily . Tobacco use likely contributes heighten overall mortality specific risk smoke related disease among veteran PTSD commonly co-occurring mental disorder . Symptoms PTSD associate mental disorder link maintenance tobacco dependence , premature dropout smoke cessation treatment , relapse smoking follow quit attempt . Many efficacious tobacco use treatment exist , number barrier limit effectiveness current method deliver treatment VA health care setting , particularly mentally ill . Novel approach smoke cessation individual PTSD need circumvent barrier integrate evidence-based tobacco use treatment ongoing mental health care . The research propose test effectiveness integrate evidence-based treatment nicotine dependence mental health care patient chronic posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Two different method deliver smoke cessation treatment compare prospective , randomize control clinical effectiveness trial conduct four Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) medical center . Smokers undergo mental health care PTSD ( n=440 ) randomly assign either : ( 1 ) practice guideline-concordant smoking cessation treatment integrate within ongoing mental health care PTSD deliver mental health provider ( Integrated Care [ IC ] ) 2 ) smoking cessation treatment deliver separately PTSD treatment smoke cessation specialist ( Usual Standard Care [ USC ] ) . Specific aim propose investigation ( 1 ) demonstrate IC effective USC reduce smoke psychiatric patient PTSD ( 2 ) demonstrate number treatment process variable , include amount dose intervention patient-specific factor , predict abstinence tobacco use smoker PTSD . Intent-to-treat analyse analyse treatment completers conduct , use Generalized Estimating Equations approach . If study hypothesis confirm , system-wide implementation experimental intervention ( IC ) veterans PTSD would double number patient stop smoking compare usual standard care tobacco use disorder . Study finding may implications integrate smoke cessation treatment mental health care patient disorder PTSD .</detailed_description>
