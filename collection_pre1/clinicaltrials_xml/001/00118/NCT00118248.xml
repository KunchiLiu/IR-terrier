	<brief_title>Tanespimycin Treating Patients With Inoperable Locoregionally Advanced Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 1-year treatment failure rate patient inoperable locoregionally advanced metastatic medullary differentiate thyroid carcinoma treat 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) ( tanespimycin ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity drug patient . Determine 1-year progression-free rate patient treat drug . II . Determine response rate duration response patient treated drug . III . Determine time treatment failure time subsequent therapy patient treat drug . IV . Determine time disease progression overall survival patient treated drug . V. Correlate incidence rate RAS , RAF , RET mutation clinical outcome patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord type thyroid carcinoma ( medullary v differentiate ) . Patients receive tanespimycin intravenously ( IV ) 2-6 hour day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 3 year study entry .</detailed_description>
