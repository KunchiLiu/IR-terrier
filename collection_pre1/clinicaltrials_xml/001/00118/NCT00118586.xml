	<brief_summary>This study look abnormality brain person affect spasmodic dysphonia , form movement disorder involve involuntary `` spasm '' muscle vocal fold cause break speech affect voice quality . The cause disorder know . The study compare result magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) people spasmodic dysphonia healthy volunteer . People adductor abductor spasmodic dysphonia healthy volunteer may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , test call nasolaryngoscopy . For test , inside subject 's nose spray decongestant , small , flexible tube call nasolaryngoscope pass nose back throat allow examination larynx ( voice box ) . During procedure , subject ask perform task talk , singing , whistle , say prolonged vowel . The nasolaryngoscope connect camera record movements vocal fold task . Eligible participant undergo MRI brain . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave instead x-ray obtain image body organ tissue . For test , subject lie table slide MRI scanner , narrow metal cylinder , wear ear plug muffle loud knock sound occur scan . During MRI anatomical image brain obtain . Subject may ask participate two scan session . Each session take 1-1/2 hour . Participants may also ask volunteer brain donation program optional . Information gain donate tissue may lead good treatment potential cure spasmodic dysphonia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spasmodic dysphonia ( SD ) focal dystonia affect neural control laryngeal musculature speech production . Although clinical symptom SD describe , underlie pathological mechanism remain unknown . Treatment strategy short benefit expensive . Muscle tension dysphonia ( MTD ) consider behavioral voice disorder many case benefit behavioral therapy . The etiology vocal misuse disorder remain unknown consider neurological thought differ SD . Vocal tremor ( VT ) form benign essential tremor . In less severely affected person , vocal tremor action-induced occur vocalization . In severe case , tremor present also exhalation whisper affect structure , velum pharynx . This also consider neurological disorder may differ character SD . Both disorder co-occur SD also occur independently . The anatomical characteristic pre- postmortem brain patient SD , MTD VT healthy volunteer investigate use image neurohistological technique provide insight pathogenesis SD . Identification neuropathological basis SD differs voice disorder would enhance understanding neurological basis SD . OBJECTIVES : Our objective study investigate anatomical morphological characteristic premortem postmortem brain person SD , determine differs voice disorder MTD VT use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , neurohistological technique . STUDY POPULATION : We plan examine person refer diagnosis SD , MTD , VT confirm whether symptom disorder identify research volunteer without neurological , psychiatric , head neck disorder . The research volunteer could spouses person SD , MTD , VT without familial relationship . DESIGN : This natural history study . In premortem part study person SD , MTD , VT research volunteer screen eligibility study . Brain MRI use 3T scanner perform volumetric reconstruction gray matter first 60 participant patient research volunteer group . In addition , high-resolution MRI use 7T scanner obtain identify focal structural difference individual basis 20 SD patient compare 20 control . DTI conduct visualization white matter tract 25 subject per group . The remain subject undergo screen anatomical MRI scan prior brain donation . In postmortem phase , study employ MRI postmortem brain specimens diagnostic purpose . Brain laryngeal tissue process histologically quantify morphological abnormality two group . Because estimate 48 % subject participate main MRI study also grant consent brain/larynx donation , maximum additional 30 subject per group recruit study . Many previous patient participate Laryngeal Speech Section protocol past contact determine would interested participating . OUTCOME MEASURES : 1 . Premortem image technique determine difference brain anatomy patient SD compare MTD , VT research volunteer : 1 . Volumetric reconstruction gray matter region involve voice production ; 2 . Visualization white matter tract brain region interest . 2 . Postmortem MRI identify discrepancy premortem postmortem brain person SD comparison MTD , VT research volunteer . 3 . Microscopic examination brain section determine whether abnormality find cortical subcortical region involve voice production person SD differ patient MTD VT. 4 . Microscopic examination larynx determine distribution motor sensory nerve ending person SD patient MTD VT control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy research volunteer patient SD , MTD , VT 21 year age eligible study . SD PATIENTS : A diagnosis adductor abductor SD base voice test fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy conduct initial interview otolaryngologist speechlanguage pathologist accord follow criterion : 1 . Intermittent strain hoarseness , uncontrolled voice break change pitch vowel , liquid ( r &amp; l ) , semivowel ( w &amp; ) , speech present adductor SD , 2 . Prolonged voiceless consonant produce breathy break present abductor SD , 3 . Less prominent symptom whisper , sing falsetto , 4 . Normal voice vocal fold movement protective emotional laryngeal function , cough , laugh cry . Postmortem brain larynx tissue SD patient decease neurological , psychiatric , laryngological cause would affect study determine medical history . MTD PATIENTS : Increased phonatory muscle tension paralaryngeal suprahyoid muscle palpation ; A consistent hypertonic laryngeal posture phonation , either anteriorposterior squeeze ( pinhole posture ) ventricular hyperadduction absence SD vocal tremor determine SpeechLanguage Pathologist staff otolaryngologist ; Exclusion laryngeal pathology base fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopic examination conduct initial interview staff otolaryngologist . VT PATIENTS : Vocal tremor vocalization primarily involve laryngeal structure ; Exclusion laryngeal pathology base fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopic examination conduct initial interview staff otolaryngologist . CONTROLS : Normal vocal function refers normal voice quality negative history voice laryngeal disorder . Research volunteer without neurological , psychiatric , otolaryngological problem determine medical history examination physician . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant woman exclude study time longer pregnant . Any individual medical history postmortem diagnose one follow contraindication exclude study : SD , MTD , AND VT PATIENTS : Other laryngeal pathology determine medical history fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopic examination conduct initial screen otolaryngologist speechlanguage pathologist , : 1 . Vocal fold paralysis , paresis , joint abnormality , neoplasm ; 2 . Vocal fold nodule , polyp , carcinoma , cyst , contact ulcer , chronic laryngitis ; 3 . Swallowing problem ; airway obstruction Speech problem determine medical history examination otolaryngologist speechlanguage pathologist . Neurological disease disorder stroke affect brain region interest , movement disorder ( e.g. , Huntington disease , chorea , myoclonus , Gilles de la Tourette syndrome , Parkinson 's disease , progressive supranuclear palsy , neurolepticinduced syndrome ) , brain tumor , traumatic brain injury loss consciousness , genetic disease CNS , chronic infection nervous system , ataxias , myopathy , myasthenia gravis , demyelinate disease , epilepsy , alcoholism , drug dependence .
