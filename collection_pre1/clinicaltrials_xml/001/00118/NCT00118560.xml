	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot project ( ) determine change calf muscle blood flow energy supply result calf muscle exercise , ( b ) determine change variable result exercise training ( walk calf muscle exercise ) . This pilot study prepare large project future . Exercise exercise training increase blood flow energy supply calf muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Objectives : 1.Develop appropriate grade calf exercise test protocol evaluate perfusion metabolism exercise subject peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , 2.compare perfusion gastroc-soleus tibialis anterior muscle exercise recovery exercise , compare metabolism muscle exercise , 3.compare perfusion exercise recovery group without PAD , compare metabolism exercise group without PAD , 4.estimate sample size effect size future clinical trial determine efficacy walk calf muscle exercise training improve calf muscle perfusion metabolism . 5.determine sensitivity specificity PET exercise test classifying subject group without PAD , 6. determine test-retest reliability coefficient perfusion metabolic measure . Two group subject participate study . Group I ( n=25 subject PAD ) undergo two set assessment . Each assessment consist complete three questionnaire , two exercise test , one PET scan session . Additionally , receive one MRI leg . Then participate three-month exercise training intervention consist treadmill walk calf muscle exercise . Finally , repeat one set assessment ( list MRI ) . Group II ( n=25 healthy control subject ) undergo two set assessment . Each assessment consist three questionnaire , two submaximal exercise test , one MRI , one PET scan session ( exercise test ) . Additionally receive one MRI . They participate exercise training intervention . Experimental Design The project pilot study cross-sectional longitudinal nature . The initial baseline measurement session allow comparison acute perfusion metabolic physiologic response two group subject ( without PAD ) . Duplicate test subject allow assessment test-retest reliability measurement . The PAD subject ' perfusion metabolic response assess three month exercise training ( walk calf muscle exercise ) . While definitive clinical trial exercise training intervention , result provide estimate sample effect size design definitive future clinical trial . Subjects Recruitment Sampling : Fifty different subject ( N=50 ) participate project , reflect available veteran patient population . The sample include primarily men , age ethnicity . Twenty-five subject PAD identify recruit via convenience sample primarily Physical Medicine Rehabilitation ( PM &amp; R ) Outpatient Clinic , Diabetes Clinic , Peripheral Vascular Clinic VA West Los Angeles Healthcare Center ( VAWLAHC ) . Other participant may recruit VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System location , specifically Los Angeles Ambulatory Care Center Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center . Twenty-five `` normal '' healthy control subject recruit via convenience sample well veteran general community ; two group match gender age . We plan enroll 25 subject PAD three-month exercise training intervention . Screening Consent : Research staff recruit interview prospective subject . Prospective subject meet initial inclusion exclusion criterion request review sign IRB-approved inform consent form enrol project . A physician physically examine prospective subject provide medical clearance prior participation . Assessments Measurements After screen consent , assessment process progress four phase : 1 . Questionnaires evaluate walk impairment , physical activity , general health . The information use well characterize study group . 2 . Exercise tolerance test demonstrate claudication symptom PAD subject treadmill walk calf muscle exercise ass functional change result training . The control subject also perform exercise test , test submaximal without pain . The data use comparison data PAD subject . 3 . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) legs measure popliteal artery diameter document location individual muscle muscle group . 4 . PET-exercise test measure muscle perfusion glucose metabolism calf muscle exercise recovery .</detailed_description>
