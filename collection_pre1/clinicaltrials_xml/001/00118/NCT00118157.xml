	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give lapatinib ditosylate together tamoxifen citrate work treat patient breast cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node area body respond previous treatment tamoxifen citrate . Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use tamoxifen citrate may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Sometimes tamoxifen citrate give , stop growth tumor cell . The tumor say resistant tamoxifen citrate . Giving lapatinib ditosylate together tamoxifen citrate may reduce drug resistance allow tumor cell kill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Tamoxifen Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer That Did Not Respond Previous Tamoxifen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( complete response partial response ) tamoxifen ( tamoxifen citrate ) GW572016 ( lapatinib ditosylate ) woman hormone refractory , metastatic breast cancer . II . To describe change phosphorylation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , human EGFR 2 ( her2 ) , protein B kinase ( AKT ) kinase , mitogen activate protein kinase ( MAPK ) , estrogen receptor ( ER ) -Serine ( Ser ) 118 , ER-Ser167 tumor tissue administration tamoxifen GW572016 . OUTLINE : Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily tamoxifen citrate PO daily . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
