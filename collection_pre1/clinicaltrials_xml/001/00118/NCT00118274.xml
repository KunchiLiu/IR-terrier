	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Cyclophosphamide may also stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Giving vaccine therapy together cyclophosphamide surgery may cause strong immune response kill remain tumor cell . It may also prevent delay recurrence melanoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase I/II trial study side effect vaccine therapy give without cyclophosphamide see well work treat patient undergone surgery stage II , stage III , stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety adjuvant vaccine therapy comprise multi-epitope melanoma peptide ( MP ) multi-epitope melanoma helper peptide ( MHP ) emulsify Montanide ISA-51 patient resect stage IIB-IV melanoma . - Determine safety administer cyclophosphamide vaccination patient . - Compare magnitude immune response vaccination comprise MP combination either MHP tetanus toxoid helper peptide ( TET ) emulsify Montanide ISA-51 v without cyclophosphamide patient . Secondary - Compare response rate persistence immune response patient treat regimen . - Compare magnitude immune response vaccination comprise TET MHP v without cyclophosphamide patient . - Compare response rate persistence immune response vaccination comprise TET MHP v without cyclophosphamide patient . - Determine delayed-type hypersensitivity response peptide component vaccines patient . - Compare , preliminarily , disease-free survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord HLA-type ( HLA-A1 positive v HLA-A2 positive , HLA-A1 negative , -A3 negative v HLA-A3 positive , -A1 negative ) participate center ( University Virginia [ UVA ] v non-UVA ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive vaccine comprise multi-epitope melanoma peptide ( MP ) tetanus toxoid helper peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 intradermally ( ID ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 29 , 36 , 43 , 85 , 183 , 274 , 365 . - Arm II : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute day -4 . Patients receive vaccine arm I . - Arm III : Patients receive vaccine comprise MP multi-epitope melanoma helper peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 ID SC day 1 , 8 , 15 , 29 , 36 , 43 , 85 , 183 , 274 , 365 . - Arm IV : Patients receive cyclophosphamide arm II . Patients receive vaccine arm III . Treatment arm continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 173 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
