	<detailed_description>Allergic rhinitis nasal inflammatory disorder initiate immunoglobulin-E ( IgE ) mediate hypersensitivity allergen . When patient expose allergen sensitive , allergen cross-link IgE antibody , bound surface tissue mast cell . This cross-linking trigger release proinflammatory substance , histamine eicosanoids , know early response . In skin prick test , reaction produce wheal-and-flare response . Normally , systemic exposure allergen also lead prolong late reaction , eosinophil , basophil , activate T cell recruit site exposure . The recruited T cell also secrete inflammatory cytokine , interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) IL-5 , typically associate helper T cell type 2 ( TH2 ) , propagate inflammatory cascade . Typically , early response occur within 15 30 minute ( quickly second ) usually resolve within 1 3 hour , late response occur within 6 12 hour resolve 24 hour . Allergic vaccination ( AV ) , also refer immunotherapy allergen-specific immunotherapy ( SIT ) , curative approach available allergic disease , directly treat underlying disease . AV practice administer gradually increase quantity allergen extract allergic patient ameliorate symptom associate subsequent exposure causative allergen . AV believe exert beneficial effect immune system , least part , modify T-lymphocyte response subsequent natural allergen exposure . AV show inhibit early late response allergen exposure . AV act T cell modify peripheral mucosal TH2 responses allergen favor helper T cell type 1 ( TH1 ) responses . One hallmarks successful AV redress `` healthy '' TH1/TH2-balance . Although efficacious , immunotherapy generally consider long-term disease modifying measure require month year treatment , entail multiple injection regimens involve risk adverse immune reaction . Allergy Therapeutics ( AT ) develop formulation year increase safety efficacy treatment . In particular , allergen extract chemically modify glutaraldehyde formulate L-tyrosine act depot adjuvant provide slow release allergen modify allergen . This increase safety profile enhance efficacy-associated immunological change . Efficacy could improve add immunological adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A ( MPL ) . Tree MATA MPL design provide vaccine efficacious three escalate dose injection , contrast longer schedule currently use . It design current advantage allergy vaccine , modify underlying disease process , opposed pharmacological control , treat symptoms . The vaccine also safer use formulation contain similar mass unmodified allergen extract due propensity unmodified allergen extract cause severe local allergic reaction anaphylaxis , reduced reactivity IgE antibody . The tolerability immunogenicity Tree MATA without MPL adjuvant investigate double-blind , randomized Phase IIa study volunteer allergic birch hazel alder pollen . Additionally , study assess residual allergenicity modify birch hazel alder pollen product Tree MATA MPL use skin prick test volunteer allergic birch hazel alder pollen .</detailed_description>
