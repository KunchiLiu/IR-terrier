	<brief_summary>Studying sample blood , urine , tissue patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change may occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor learn genistein placebo work patient bladder cancer . This randomized phase II trial study genistein placebo compare work patient undergoing surgery bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Isoflavone G-2535 ( Genistein ) Patients With Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure effect G-2535 EGF-R phosphorylation . Two EGF-R phosphorylation sit functional significance phosphotyrosine 992 , direct bind site PLC-gamma SH2 domain , phosphotyrosine 1068 , bind site Grb2/SH2 domain . The expression EGF-R phosphorylated EGF-R determine tumor well adjacent remote normal appear urothelium . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measuring tissue intermediate endpoint biomarkers EGF-R mutation ( EGFR vIII , exon 19-21 ) , Ki67 , activate Caspase 3 , Akt , P-Akt , MAP kinase , P-MAP kinase , COX-2 , survivin , BLCA-4 also determine survivin BLCA-4 level urine specimen surrogate tumor marker . Biomarkers associate EGF-R pathway , include Akt P-Akt study immunohistochemistry . Additionally , Ki67 , activate Caspase 3 ( marker apoptosis ) , COX-2 serve biological endpoint biomarkers measure effect G-2535 proliferation , apoptosis , process molecule relevant bladder cancer . These study perform tumor well adjacent remote normal urothelium . II . Safety also study . OUTLINE : This randomize , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord invasiveness disease ( non-invasive [ stage Ta , Tis , T1 ] v invasive [ stage T2 , T3 , T4 ] ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral genistein twice daily approximately 14-30 day . Arm II : Patients receive oral genistein arm I high dose . Arm III : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily approximately 14-30 day . One day completion genistein placebo , patient undergo cystoscopic excision , transurethral resection bladder tumor , cystectomy . Patients undergo blood , urine , tissue sample collection pharmacogenomic , pharmacokinetic , biomarker laboratory study . Blood urine sample collect baseline , 1 week treatment , time surgery pharmacokinetic urine biomarker ( survivin BLCA-4 ) study . Pharmacogenomic study ( epidermal growth factor receptor [ EGFR ] polymorphisms CYP3A 4/5 genotype ) perform baseline use blood sample . Tissue biomarker ( EGFR polymorphism , EGFR mutation [ EGFR vIII , exon 19-21 ] , EGFR , phosphorylated EGFR , Ki67 , activate caspase 3 , Akt , P-Akt , MAP kinase , P-MAP kinase , COX-2 , survivin , BLCA4 ) study use tumor tissue adjacent remote normal urothelium perform baseline completion treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient ( 20 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
