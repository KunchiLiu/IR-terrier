	<brief_title>17-AAG Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Previous Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response patient hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer treat 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall survival disease-free survival rate patient treat drug . II . Determine safety profile drug patient . III . Determine duration PSA response PSA control patient treat drug . IV . Determine partial complete response rate patient measurable disease treat drug . V. Correlate change expression level interleukin-6 , maspin , NF-kappaB serum tissue cancer treatment-related outcome patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) IV 2-6 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course treatment beyond documentation CR . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 16-28 patient accrue study within 20 month .</detailed_description>
