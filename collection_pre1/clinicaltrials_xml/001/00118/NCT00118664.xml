	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn blood clotting substance respond child septic shock , low platelet count , multiple organ failure ( MOF ) treat different institution . Multiple organ failure relate infection produce `` septic shock , '' substance release blood cause poor blood flow organ . The number platelet circulate child 's blood stream also decrease ( call `` thrombocytopenia '' ) result condition . Research show certain substance part blood know plasma ( clear liquid part blood include red blood cell hold blood clot factor ) cause organs work poorly . The investigator would like compare blood response child condition , receive variety different treatment , multiple organ failure medical center around world . The investigator hope enroll 80 patient study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Plasma Response Outcome Septic Shock With Thrombocytopenia Associated Multiple Organ Failure Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers define subgroup pediatric patient critical illness specific coagulation profile associate thrombocytopenia . This distinct entity , define thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure ( TAMOF ) , demonstrate predispose affected child worsen organ failure increase risk death . A preliminary single-center study perform Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh ( CHP ) suggest significant improvement organ system dysfunction TAMOF patient use plasma exchange protocol compare standard therapy alone . The investigator desire evaluate plasma profile clinical outcome pediatric TAMOF broader geographic setting . The investigator propose perform prospective multi-center observational cohort study evaluate plasma response clinical outcome pediatric patient TAMOF due critical illness associate systemic infection , sepsis , organ transplant , chemotherapy cardiopulmonary bypass . Plasma sample obtain patient measurement marker coagulation inflammation . The primary clinical endpoint measure organ failure index score , pediatric logistic organ dysfunction ( PELOD ) score , day resolution organ failure . Cohort outcome analysis also perform pair patient different center receive standard therapy receive plasma exchange additional therapy .</detailed_description>

Thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 100,000 per ul ) , patient baseline platelet count &lt; 100,000 per ul , minimum 50 % decrease platelet count Etiology MOF due systemic infection , shock , transplantation , chemotherapy , cardiopulmonary bypass Treatment prior study entry form plasma exchange therapy within 30 day TAMOF Thrombocytopenia secondary diagnose thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome ( TTP/HUS ) Patients terminal illness ( i.e . expect live &gt; 60 day even survive acute illness ) withdrawal therapy consider ( donotresuscitate [ DNR ] /comfort measure , limited therapy etc . )</criteria>
