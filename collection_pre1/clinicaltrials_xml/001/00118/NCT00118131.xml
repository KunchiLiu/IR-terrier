	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give docetaxel together cisplatin work treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Cisplatin Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity docetaxel cisplatin , measure tumor response rate , patient chemotherapy-naïve stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - Determine duration response patient treat regimen . - Determine time disease progression patient treat regimen . - Determine 1-year survival rate patient treat regimen . - Determine median survival time patient treated regimen . - Correlate aneuploidy ( determine DNA histogram ) immunohistochemical expression stathmin , Aurora-A , survivin response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 76 patient accrue study within 13-19 month .</detailed_description>
