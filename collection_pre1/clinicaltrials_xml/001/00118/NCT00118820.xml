	<brief_summary>Despite 50 year antibiotic use multiple clinical investigation ( &gt; 50 ) , definitive study exist confirm refute use systemic antibiotic prevent postoperative inflammatory complication third molar ( M3 ) , aka `` wisdom teeth '' removal . Among patient M3s extract , administration systemic prophylactic antibiotic compare placebo , decrease rate postoperative inflammatory complication ? The first specific aim study implement randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial determine systemic prophylactic antibiotic , compare placebo , decrease rate postoperative alveolar osteitis ( AO ) M3 extraction . For proposal , postoperative AO primary outcome variable . The second specific aim implement pilot study use randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial determine systemic prophylactic antibiotic , compare placebo , decrease rate postoperative infection M3 extraction . For purpose proposal , postoperative infection secondary outcome variable . Based sample size estimate , believe necessary implement multi-year trial address second specific aim definitively . As , use experience preliminary result derive clinical trial develop implement future large scale clinical trial . The third specific aim identify risk factor associate postoperative inflammatory complication order develop model predict prophylactic administration antibiotic prevent postoperative inflammatory complication alveolar osteitis infection follow removal M3 's . The long-term goal project provide compel clinical evidence support recommendation regard use systemic antibiotic set alter clinical practice base result well-done , definitive clinical investigation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The management impact M3s high volume procedure . In United States , cost M3 removal estimate 2 billion dollar , include cost consults , x-ray , medication , surgical center charge , 5 million surgical extraction treatment postoperative inflammatory complication ( Flick . 1999 ) . Practices associate M3 removal significant impact large number patient , provider , payer . There currently consensus use systemic antibiotic prophylaxis decrease risk inflammatory complication follow M3 removal.The common post-operative inflammatory complication follow M3 extraction alveolar osteitis ( AO ) wound infection ( Larsen , 1992 ; Piecuch et al. , 1995 ; Sekar et al. , 2001 ) . AO , aka `` dry socket , '' wound-healing problem characterize severe , unremitting pain . The reported frequency AO 6-68 % . Bacterial colonization stimulates plasmin production fibrinolysis dissolution extraction site clot . More 45 % patient sustain AO require 4 5 postoperative appointment resolution symptom ( Larsen , 1992 ; Andra et al. , 1990 ) . Given common occurrence , identify treatment , i.e . systemic antibiotic , decrease rate AO follow M3 extraction would important contribution enhance patient outcome . The second common postoperative inflammatory condition follow M3 extraction wound infection . The reported frequency postoperative infection range 1.2 - 27 % , study report frequency &lt; 10 % . Because wound infection bacterial , hypothesize use systemic antibiotic reduce rate postoperative wound infection . There , however , definitive prospective study support refute necessity systemic antibiotic prevention postoperative inflammatory complication AO infection . All study publish date address role systemic antibiotic M3 removal one major methodological flaw study design characterize :1 ) ambiguous definition outcome variable , 2 ) inadequate sample size , 3 ) non-uniformity protocol design , 4 ) lack randomization techniques 5 ) poor-follow-up monitoring . Clearly , need definitive , rigorous , well-designed placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial ascertain efficacy systemic antibiotic prevent postoperative inflammatory complication M3 removal .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Demographics : While age eligible study enrollment , practical matter , patient M3s remove usually &gt; 1314 year age . Gender : Males female offer participate study . Race : All race ethnicity eligible study enrollment . Clinical status : least one impacted mandibular third molar ( M3 ) must schedule extraction . Anesthesia : Patient request procedure execute use intravenous sedation general anesthesia . Intravenous sedation accomplish use IV place antecubital fossa patient Health status : Healthy patient patient mild systemic disease , i.e . ASA status &lt; 3 , eligible study enrollment . Preexisting infection : Infection characterise area frank purulence and/or cellulitis characterize erythema , induration inability open mouth wide enough provide access airway . Preexisting Systemic Illness : evidence severe dry mouth , patient undergo radiotherapy oral cancer , patient immunocompromised , patient require antibiotic prophylaxis endocarditis , well , patient take antimicrobial systemic disease , i.e. , uncontrolled diabetes. , ASA status &gt; 2 . Allergic Reactions Medications : Patients allergic Penicillin Clindamycin exclude study . Anesthesia : Patient request operation perform local anesthesia without intravenous sedation general anesthesia . Pregnancy : Pregnancy relative contraindication study enrollment . If consultation obstetrician , contraindication remove impacted teeth sedation contraindication receive test medication ( penicillin clindamycin ) patient want pursue treatment , would consider eligible study enrollment .</criteria>
