	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient stage IIIB IV bronchoalveolar carcinoma ( BAC ) adencarcinoma lung BAC feature treat bortezomib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . II . Determine time disease progression patient treat drug . III . Determine predictor response , base molecular correlative study tumor blood , patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy ( yes v ) . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow survival .</detailed_description>
