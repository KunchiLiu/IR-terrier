	<brief_summary>The group B streptococcus ( GBS ) vaccine study do see single vaccination GBS type III vaccine stop woman get GBS type III bacteria vagina . Approximately 600 woman , age 18-40 , enrolled clinical site participate study . Participants non-pregnant , sexually active ( sex male least last 4 month ) , GBS negative vagina rectum screen visit . Participants randomly assign receive experimental GBS type III vaccine license vaccine contain Tetanus Diphtheria Toxoids ( Td ) . Participants follow one month , 2 month every month thereafter follow vaccination ( vaginal rectal swab collection blood draw ) 1Â½ year total 10 post vaccination visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vaginal colonization single important risk factor transmission group B Streptococcus ( GBS ) mother neonate , result neonatal sepsis and/or meningitis . The long-term goal study determine whether vaccine-induced serum antibody type III GBS sufficient prevent vaginal acquisition type III GBS . This study link Division Microbiology Infectious Diseases protocol 04-018 . It randomize , double-blinded , comparative clinical trial among young ( 18-40 year old ) , non-pregnant , sexually active woman currently colonize vaginally rectally type III GBS , conduct evaluate efficacy GBS type III-TT vaccine prevention type III GBS vaginal acquisition . The observation period patient 18 month follow vaccination . The specific objective : enroll 600 woman ( previously screen within last 14 day GBS Screening Protocol ) identify GBS type III negative , vaginally rectally ; vaccinate 600 woman randomize 1:1 ratio 50 microgram type III GBS polysaccharide conjugate tetanus toxoid ( GBS III-TT ) license vaccine contain Tetanus Diphtheria Toxoids adsorb adult use ( Td ) ; measure reactogenicity subject report 7-day symptom diary 1-2 day follow-up telephone call ; evaluate woman 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 18 month serum antibody response . Blood obtain clinic follow-up visit serum use compare type III GBS specific antibody level baseline follow-up ; assess vaginal rectal acquisition GBS month 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 18 month use specimen obtain clinic visit ; compare woman receive GBS III-TT vaccine woman receive Td vaccine respect time first vaginal culture positive type III GBS ; assess relationship person-level covariates , include feature decrease type III GBS antibody level time , time first vaginal culture positive type III GBS ; assess effect vaginal colonization hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) -producing Lactobacillus , sexual activity , antibiotic usage , rectal colonization GBS demographic feature risk factor acquisition type III GBS , independent serum antibody level . The primary study endpoint time first vaginal swab type III GBS culture positive , previous culture negative type III GBS , immediately preceding culture . The secondary endpoint include : proportion vaginal swab type III GBS culture positive ; proportion subject whose vaginal culture type III GBS culture negative throughout study ; frequency vaginal colonization GBS serotypes Ia , Ib , II V ; measurement serum immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G antibody level type III GBS 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 , 14 , 16 18 month follow vaccination ; measurement post-vaccination antibody level type III GBS , stratify pre-vaccination level native antibody ; frequency local systemic symptom attributable vaccination ; density type III GBS culture vaginal swabs culture positive visit .</detailed_description>
