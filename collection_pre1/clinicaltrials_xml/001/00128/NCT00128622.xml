	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Combinations biological substance denileukin diftitox may able carry cancer-killing substance directly cancer cell . Vaccines make gene-modified virus person 's white blood cell may help body build effective immune response kill cancer cell . Giving denileukin diftitox together vaccine therapy may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect give denileukin diftitox together vaccine therapy treat patient metastatic cancer express carcinoembryonic antigen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Denileukin Diftitox Followed Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety feasibility two different schedule denileukin diftitox follow active immunotherapy comprise autologous dendritic cell infect recombinant fowlpox-CEA ( 6D ) -TRICOM vaccine patient metastatic CEA-expressing malignancy . Secondary - Determine immune response regimen patient . - Determine , preliminarily , clinical response rate and/or time progression patient assessable disease treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients undergo leukapheresis collection peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . PBMCs culture sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) interleukin-4 production dendritic cell ( DC ) . DC mixed recombinant fowlpox-TRICOM produce vaccine . Patients assign 1 2 cohort accord timing study enrollment . - Cohort 1 : Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV least 15 minute week 0 vaccine therapy comprise autologous DC infect recombinant fowlpox-CEA ( 6D ) -TRICOM vaccine intradermally subcutaneously week 0 ( begin 4 day denileukin diftitox infusion ) , 3 , 6 , 9 . If &lt; 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity , second cohort patient enrol . - Cohort 2 : Patients receive denileukin diftitox cohort 1 week 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 vaccine cohort 1 . In cohort , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually 15 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 6-12 patient ( 6 per cohort ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
