	<brief_title>Efficacy Methylprednisolone Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study phase II , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled evaluation intravenous methylprednisolone versus placebo treatment hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome ( HCPS ) . Patients suspect known hantavirus randomize receive intravenous methylprednisolone placebo 3 day . Following completion acute phase therapy , patient see follow visit day 14 , 28 , 84 6 month study entry . Follow visit include physical examination , include vital sign . In addition , blood drawn blood count , clinical chemistry , quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( day 14 ) . Since Hantavirus pathogenesis involve pulmonary system , test perform include chest x ray ( day 28 ) spirometry ( day 28 180 ) . The study require 60 subject confirm Hantavirus infection . Study subject include male female great equal 2 year age suspect Hantavirus disease . The enrol co investigator must feel Hantavirus disease likely basis clinical syndrome . The primary study objective : ass efficacy intravenous methylprednisolone reduce severity HCPS ass safety methylprednisolone person suspect proven Hantavirus infection . The secondary objective : assess impact therapy viremia ass whether measurement neutralize antibody titer entry Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) type identify subgroup increase risk severe disease and/or death whether therapy effective subgroup . The primary endpoint include : proportion subject develop one follow critical event associate severe disease 28 day study entry : death , PaO2/FiO2 ratio less equal 55 , cardiac index less equal 2.2 , pulseless electrical activity , ventricular tachycardia fibrillation ; number serious adverse event determine study investigator least possibly relate study treatment . For endpoint researcher report : median number serious adverse event proportion experience one serious adverse event . The secondary study endpoint include : assist define natural history disease meaningfully affect treatment : Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( ECMO ) ; duration intensive care unit stay ; duration hospital stay ; duration shock and/or pressor/inotropic support ; length time mechanical ventilation ; intubate place ventilator ; refractory shock despite fluid resuscitation ; serum creatinine great equal 3.0 milligrams/deciliter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Informed consent give patient guardian . And one following : Confirmed diagnosis : Positive hantavirus IgM assay detection hantavirus plasma serum RTPCR presence acute febrile illness le 12 day duration , 1 . Onset hypoxia ( oxygen saturation less equal 92 % require supplemental oxygen ) one day onset symptom , 2 . Development pulmonary infiltrates chest Xray . OR Presumptive diagnosis : The presumptive diagnosis acute hantavirus disease le 12 day duration : 1 . Febrile illness ( subjective document ) judgment enrol investigator ; 2 . Headache myalgia least one digestive symptom ( nausea , diarrhea , vomit , abdominal pain ) 3 . A platelet count le 150,000 peripheral smear ; 4 . Onset hypoxia ( oxygen saturation less equal 92 % require supplemental oxygen ) one day onset symptom , 5 . Development bilateral pulmonary infiltrates chest Xray Age le 2 year . If presumptive diagnosis inclusion criterion : subject likely diagnosis hantavirus infection , include positive culture direct test respiratory virus ( e.g. , influenza , RSV , etc ) group A Streptococcus person illness compatible streptococcal pharyngitis , positive culture normally sterile site , presentation consistent bacterial pneumonia . Immunocompromised patient risk opportunistic infection ( e.g. , patient HIV infection , underlie malignancy , receive chemotherapy immunosuppressive drug within 30 day . ) Patients receive systemic antiviral medication ( acyclovir , famciclovir , amantadine rimantadine ) , systemic corticosteroid equivalent approximately 0.5mg/kg prednisone , investigational drug within 30 day enrollment treatment . Any period extreme bradycardia , pulseless electric activity Active GI bleeding , hematemesis , melena hematochezia document upper low endoscopy gastric aspiration .</criteria>
