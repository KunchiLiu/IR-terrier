	<brief_summary>This study evaluate patient abnormal immune function result recurrent unusual infection chronic inflammation . This may include inherited condition , X-linked severe combine immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) , chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) , leukocyte adhesion deficiency ( LAD ) , condition result outside factor , graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . The information study use establish pattern pace change disease help develop new treatment . The period observation study follow enrollment study may one year . In addition study may provide medical information need determine eligibility enrollment clinical study protocol prolong follow . Patients age abnormal immune function recurrent unusual infection , whose blood test show evidence immune dysfunction , GVHD , XSCID , CGD LAD may eligible study . Patients ' parent , sibling , grandparent , child , aunt , uncle first cousins age also may include . Healthy normal volunteer 18 85 year age recruit control . Normal volunteer undergo physical examination provide blood , saliva , urine sample immune function study . Patients ' family member provide medical history , physical examination , give blood urine sample , possibly saliva sample . The sample use genetic routine laboratory study . Investigators may request tissue sample , biopsy specimen , previously remove medical reason send NIH study . Patients undergo follow test procedure : 1 . Medical history physical examination . 2 . Blood urine test , include analysis gene involve immune disorder . 3 . Buccal smear ( patient ) genetic study . This involve scrap line mouth near cheek . 4 . Specialized test evaluate specific condition patient immune disorder might affect lung function , gum infection eye problem . These may include chest x-ray , CT scan , breathe function test , dental , eye , hear examination . 5 . Follow-up visit patient immune problem may occur 6 month one year first visit ( frequently medically require ) include : - Medical history update - Physical examination - Follow-up abnormal test result medical treatment initiate NIH - Collection blood , saliva , urine , wound drainage sample repeat immune function study - Tissue study specimens remove medical reason institution besides NIH</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Patients With Immune Function Abnormalities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol design screen baseline assessment collection research sample patient abnormality immune function manifest recurrent unusual infection , recurrent chronic inflammation , previous laboratory evidence immune dysfunction . Abnormalities immune function may inherit may iatrogenic follow hematopoietic stem cell transplantation treatment result prolonged immune dysfunction . Blood and/or bone marrow cell may also use investigate utility induce pluripotent stem cell ( iPS ) immune cell derivation target gene correction . This protocol study screen human immunodeficiency virus infection , though patient HIV infection may cause immune dysfunction exclude . First second degree genetically relate family member ( limited mother , father , sibling , grandparent , child , aunt , uncle first cousins affected patient ) may also screen clinical , vitro genetic correlate immune abnormality . Healthy Volunteers enrol source control blood sample research testing , include genetic testing . Screening baseline assessment auspex study may limit two visit one year period , unless patient determine initial evaluation require study NIH ongoing long-term safety assessment require participation gene therapy transplant protocol . Patients document immune dysfunction may receive limited medically indicate treatment medically indicate treatment related abnormality immune function study , treatment limited period one year baseline assessment indicate protocol . When screen assessment complete , patient offer opportunity participate another study , active study appropriate patient , option suggest primary refer physician . This protocol allow detailed investigation patient abnormality immune function one year observation follow goal : 1 . To determine degree , scope cause immune dysfunction ; 2 . To establish pace pattern change disease process ; 3 . To determine extent organ involvement damage immune dysfunction . This screen baseline assessment necessary discover new cause immune abnormality , delineate epidemiology immune deficiency , develop new diagnostic therapeutic tool , determine patient 's eligibility study . Lung MRI CT supplement Infection Surveillance Immunodeficiencies : The routine use compute tomography ( CT ) increase substantially since introduction medicine , , turn , also increase amount radiation individual expose . This increase radiation without risk particularly problematic primary immunodeficiency disease population , require serial imaging chest CTs manage pneumonia . Standard medical practice patient population diagnose infection obtain diagnostic CT repeat CT every three four week lesion resolve order guide treatment course . Although radiation dose institution reduce factor four last several year result peak kilovoltage ( kVp ) reduction dose modulation iterative reconstruction ; cumulative radiation exposure carry increase lifetime risk cancer reduce exposure keep mandate , As Low As Reasonably Achievable ( ALARA ) . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , expose patient ionize radiation , show promise detect obvious infiltrates secondary cross sectional ability increase resolution . Previously , lung MRI consider potential substitute CT poor signal- to- noise ratio ( SNR ) due low density proton lung parenchyma , short T2* relaxation time lung secondary air-tissue base susceptibility , challenge image long scan time result respiratory , vascular cardiac motion artifact . However , recent development MRI scan technique provide ultra short echo time ( UTE ) along oversampling k-space center appear overcome mentioned drawback MRI image lung/ chest . For protocol , use optimized version MRI UTE pulse sequence 3T clinical scanner perform breath-hold ( BH ) coronal BH free-breathing axial image . Our goal comprehensively evaluate lung without additional radiation clinically reasonable scan time &lt; 30 minute , especially proportionally high percentage young adult . Subjects enrol 05-I-0213 primary immune deficiency may consider participation sub study evaluate feasibility novel MRI technique compare standard CT image pathology surveillance undergo medically indicate CT image diagnosis monitoring infection .</detailed_description>
