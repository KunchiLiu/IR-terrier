	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody TNT-1/B patient progressive recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . Secondary - Determine biodistribution radiation dosimetry drug patient . - Determine toxicity tolerability drug patient . - Determine overall survival , median time survival , 6-month survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study therapeutic dos iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody TNT-1/B ( ^131I MOAB TNT-1/B ) . The first 12 patient accrue study undergo stereotactic placement 2 catheter within contrast-enhancing tumor day 0 . These patient receive image dose ^131I MOAB TNT-1/B interstitially approximately 25 hour day 1 follow dosimetry , biodistribution evaluation , whole body image 8-10 day period . Beginning least 2 week , 4 week later , patient undergo catheter placement . One day later , patient receive therapeutic dose ^131I MOAB TNT-1/B interstitially approximately 25 hour . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate therapeutic dos ^131I MOAB TNT-1/B maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . An additional 10 patient treated MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow weekly 3 week , 6 week , 4 , 8 , 12 week ( first 12 patient accrue study ) , every 4 week disease progression , every 8 week thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 22 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
