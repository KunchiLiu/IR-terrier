	<brief_title>Study Velcade® Bone Formation Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies Myeloma Institute Research &amp; Therapy show Velcade effective treating patient relapse treat least two line prior therapy . One key factor multiple myeloma bone destruction cause myeloma cell . Most patient multiple myeloma ( 80 % ) develop skeletal lesion , despite treatment . These lesion rarely repair , even myeloma remission . Experience MIRT suggest Velcade may increase osteoblast ( bone cell cause bone growth ) activity . One goal study identify Velcade 's effect myeloma due ability increase osteoblasts . This study also follow goal : - To find low dose Velcade effect myeloma also increase bone activation ; - To identify way predict Velcade increase bone activation . Time period : According cohort assignment , receive three cycle Velcade®™ ( 1.3 mg/m2 , 1.0 mg/m2 0.7 mg/m2 ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 21-day cycle . During first two cycle Velcade®™ , bone marker ( test bone ) measure Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 : Pre-dose , post-dose , every 2 4 hour 8 hour . Days 2-3 , 5-7 , 9-10 , 12-21 : every 24 hour , begin immediate post-dose sample ( +/- 2 hour ) During third cycle Velcade®™ , bone marker measure Days 1 11 : Pre-dose post-dose , Day 21 .</detailed_description>
