	<brief_summary>Treatment patient PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis consist two phase : remission induction highly effective , also relatively toxic , drug , secondly , remission achieve , maintenance therapy less toxic drug . Currently , remission-maintenance therapy azathioprine stop approximately 18 month . However , optimal duration azathioprine maintenance therapy unknown . The investigator find patient PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis remain cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody ( C-ANCA ) positive induction remission increase risk experience relapse disease . Therefore test whether relapse risk patient reduce extend maintenance therapy cost acceptable therapy relate toxicity . After induction stable remission , ANCA measure immunofluorescence ( IIF ) . C-ANCA positive patient randomize either standard therapy azathioprine ( 18 month diagnosis ) , longterm azathioprine maintenance therapy ( 48 month diagnosis ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment patient PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis consist two phase : remission induction highly effective , also relatively toxic , drug , secondly , remission achieve , maintenance therapy less toxic drug . Currently , remission-maintenance therapy azathioprine stop approximately 18 month . However , optimal duration azathioprine maintenance therapy unknown . The investigator find patient PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis remain C-ANCA positive induction remission increase risk experience relapse disease ( MC Slot et al . Arthritis Rheum . 2004 15 ; 51 ( 2 ) :269-73 ) . Therefore test whether relapse risk patient reduce extend maintenance therapy cost acceptable therapy relate toxicity . After induction stable remission , ANCA measure IIF . C-ANCA positive patient randomize either standard therapy azathioprine ( 18 month diagnosis ) , longterm azathioprine maintenance therapy ( 48 month diagnosis ) .</detailed_description>
