	<brief_title>Treatment Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( ITP ) With Subcutaneously Administered Anti-D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) child consider benign hematological disease . The incidence approximately 50 case year Denmark . Approximately 25 % experience chronic disease . Follow treatment patient centralize . The drug choice intravenous IgG ( IVIG ) treatment ITP . The side effect flu-like symptom , rare case aseptic meningitis . Another option intravenous anti-D , child rhesus positive . Anti-D primarily use North America . The effect Anti-D comparable IVIG consider time take bring platelet count 50,000/Î¼L . Anti-D also cause flu-like symptom . Establishing i.v . access disadvantage IVIG anti-D. For treatment mechanism action finally describe . Subcutaneous IgG substitution therapy use patient suffer agammaglobulinaemia . It therefore know , immunoglobulin uptake possible subcutaneous administration . Subcutaneous anti-D tried patient suffer chronic thrombocytopenia positive result . IVIG treatment expensive compare anti-D . Treatment 20 kg child cost approximately 17,000 Dkr IVIG 2,500 Dkr . anti-D. Hypothesis : - Subcutaneous administer anti-D effective IVIG/i.v . anti-D ; - Subcutaneous administer anti-D few less severe side effect IVIG/i.v . anti-D. Purpose : - To document effect subcutaneous anti-D ; - Describe complication ; - Describe aspect mechanism action . Material Methods : Children eligible admit pediatric department Denmark diagnosis , observation treatment acute chronic ITP . Examination diagnostic work similar throughout country , identical . No specific test require diagnosis . If treatment indicate rhesus positive child treat subcutaneous anti-D. Rhesus negative child treat accord local guideline . Specified follow-up child mandatory . For research purpose one blood sample form child collect , child , receive medical treatment , several blood sample collect . Analysis change immunological signal peptide perform special attention mechanism action anti-D .</detailed_description>
