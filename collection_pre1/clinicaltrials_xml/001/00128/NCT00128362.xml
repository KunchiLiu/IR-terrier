	<brief_summary>The advent mammography increase awareness breast cancer result detection small tumor , majority would metastasize axillary lymph node . The sentinel node ( SN ) presumably first echelon node axillary basin become involve metastatic breast cancer cell . Sentinel node biopsy ( SNB ) operable breast cancer gain popularity since promise avoid treatment axilla node negative metastasis . Advances technology ( radio-guided SNB ) associate risk false negative SN report 4-12 % . The consequence leave behind untreated positive non-sentinel node axilla potential risk axillary recurrence . Axillary sample simple inexpensive procedure level I nod remove blind dissection . The investigator critically analyze efficacy procedure separately consecutive pilot study i.e. , target SNB versus blind axillary sampling . The current study plan prospective comparison study patient undergoes procedure surgical intervention thus provide immediate comparison two technique respect effectiveness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Axillary node dissection operable breast cancer provide accurate way stag disease . With increased popularity screen early diagnosis , woman harbor axillary metastasis , case , axillary lymph node dissection could avoid . Sentinel node biopsy ( SNB ) gain rapid popularity technique could predict presence metastasis downstream lymph node , surgery associate morbidity could safely avoid . SNB perform injection isosulphan blue subdermally peritumorally alone combination radio-guidance technetium-99 label colloid injection . Radio-guided SNB superior blue dye identify SN , combine technique still well . However , fail accomplish objective proportion case sentinel node could identify even expensive gadgetry like gamma probe . An overview sentinel node study show node find 85-90 % patient overall sensitivity correctly predict negative axilla sentinel node biopsy 94 % . There false negative rate 6.2 % wherein sentinel node report negative presence metastasis non-sentinel node axilla . Axillary sample forerunner target sentinel node biopsy . The main objective axillary sampling time detect positive axilla . More recently test accurate predictor axillary status absence metastasis . There definite learning curve SNB high non-detection rate false negative rate earlier phase study compare later part . This learn curve absent axillary sampling , require specialized training expensive equipment 100 % detection rate . The mean number sentinel node identify , report various SNB study , 2.13 ( range mean number SN dissect 1.3-3.1 ) . The actual range number sentinel node dissect 1 - 8 , quite comparable average 4 -5 node require sample accurately predict axilla . Badwe Mittra conclude sentinel node biopsy expensive driven lure technology fashion , little advantage axillary node sample predict negative axilla . There validation study low axillary sampling versus total axillary clearance report Steele et al 1985 sensitivity 100 % accuracy 99.5 % . The recent validation study 5-node axillary sampling compare level I-II dissection report Stockholm 416 operable breast cancer patient . The noteworthy finding study node sample 100 % yield , 97.3 % sensitivity negative predictive value 98.5 % false negative rate 2.7 % predict axilla . The comparative figure SNB world overview 94 % sensitivity , 97 % negative predictive value false negative rate 6.5 % . Preliminary study SNB axillary sampling TMH Sentinel node biopsy Isosulphan blue injection perform validation pilot study Breast unit TMH April 1999 November 2000 100 woman clinically node negative operable breast cancer . SN find 77 % case false negative rate 16.6 % sensitivity 76.1 % . The procedure negative predictive value 90.4 % case predict rest axilla . The number sentinel node dissect 1-6 average 1.4 . Axillary sample subsequently perform pilot study May 2001 August 2002 97 woman similar clinical stage . Nodes find patient ( 100 % ) level I false negative reporting 11 % case , sensitivity 88.9 % , negative predictive value 100 % average 4 node dissect ( range 1-9 ) . In develop country limit resource , may feasible every institution acquire gamma probe . Axillary sampling may thus comparably cheap practical alternative SNB . Axillary sample sentinel node biopsy , however , compare respect resultant morbidity false negative rate adopt either method standard clinical practice . The Nottingham group recently publish result prospective study find value add SNB 4-node axillary sampling ( 4NAS ) within patient . Two hundred patient accrued 4NAS find low false negative rate compare SNB . We propose compare two procedure clinical trial comparison respective false negative rate sensitivity immediate end point . Methodology : Eligible woman recruit study obtain informed consent centrally register Clinical Research Secretariat Tata Memorial Hospital , Mumbai . The radiolabeled Tc-99 colloid phytate ( 500 Mbq ) inject primary tumor 2 hour surgery . A localized scintiscan perform confirm radiolabeling sentinel node surgery documentation . Isosulphan blue dye inject subdermal ( 0.5ml ) tumor intraparenchymal ( 3-4ml ) towards axilla 10-15mins incision . Axillary sample perform first . A 2 cm incision make middle third propose axillary clearance incision axillary hairline . All axillary fat tissue area 2cm diameter dissect . The anterior limit dissection posterior border pectoralis major , posterior limit dissection anterior border latissimus dorsi muscle , upper limit dissection intercostobrachial nerve , base serratus anterior muscle lateral chest wall . In case undergo mastectomy , tissue axillary tail identify first remove specify . After completion sample procedure , remain axillary tissue check node show blue discoloration radioactivity document find outside axillary sampling . Axillary clearance separately complete patient standard technique extend incision without wait frozen section report .</detailed_description>
