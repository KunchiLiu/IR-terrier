	<detailed_description>Clinical research allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) document improvement disease free interval , disease free survival , severity treatment related toxicity . Those survive , however , continue experience side-effects psychological difficulty year follow allogeneic HSCT . Long term complication occur delay effect condition regimen transplant well side effect medication require maintain new donor-derived immune system . In addition various biological complication , long-term effect psychological , social , physical , functional symptom experience ( growth limitation ) document . Although knowledge exists help u understand experience various group allogeneic HSCT patient , face allogeneic transplant change considerably last five year limit application exist report . Patients new type diseases e.g . solid tumor older ( great 55 year ) significant debilitation undergo allogeneic HSCT . It important patient family know effect expect follow allogeneic transplant . This lack clarity research limit ability focus future intervention study begin make difference patient high risk poor health outcome follow allogeneic HSCT . Understanding factor associate variability recovery follow allogeneic HSCT increase likelihood patient ultimately return normal , productive life . Existing research regard recovery adult survivor allogeneic HSCT indicate many patient experience difficulty variety Health Related Quality Life ( HRQL ) domains . A critical issue remain unexamined concern extent domain improve , remain static , perhaps even deteriorate passage time allogeneic HSCT . Results discuss respect implication encouragement realistic expectation recovery follow allogeneic HSCT well development intervention . The long term goal study characterize longitudinally functional health , psychosocial adjustment , HRQL symptom experience associate long term survival allogeneic HSCT . This study two specific aim : 1 . To examine functional status , psychosocial adjustment HRQL patient great equal 3 year follow allogeneic HSCT . 2 . To examine symptom experience patient great equal 3 year follow allogeneic HSCT . Data analyze use method longitudinal analysis , generalize estimate equation , mixed-effects model growth mixture model evaluate change time outcome variable .</detailed_description>
