	<brief_summary>The purpose study see healthy people leprosy patient react 2 new skin test detect leprosy . The study evaluate new skin test may aid measure number people expose leprosy enable diagnosis treatment earlier stage . Participant 's age 18-60 living Kathmandu , Nepal enrol . Stages A B study use skin test healthy volunteer . Stage C use skin test high risk volunteer ( include individual leprosy ) , healthy individual contact leprosy patient individual tuberculosis ( TB , lung disease ) . Study procedure include injection , physical exam , blood testing . Injection sit check several time participant 's study involvement ( 5 hour time spread approximately 1 month ) . Volunteers screen study , leprosy tuberculosis treat referred treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leprosy Skin Test Antigens Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind Phase II clinical trial conduct 3 stage evaluate 2 new leprosy skin test antigen , Mycobacterium ( M. ) leprae Soluble Antigen ( MLSA ) -Lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) M. leprae Cell Wall Antigen ( MLCwA ) , diagnostic-epidemiological tool design measure incidence leprosy infection Kathmandu , Nepal , leprosy endemic area . Stage A provide initial indication safety 2 new test antigens 10 healthy member leprosy endemic population ( 5 subject per antigen 2 dosage ) . Stage B expand analysis additional 90 healthy subject ( 45 subject per antigen ) . If subject Stage A B show ulceration 1.0 mcg dose MLSA-LAM MLCwA test site , 0.1 mcg dose use Stage C. The final stage , Stage C , divide 2 part . The first part , Stage C-1 , assess safety antigen high dose ( 1.0 mcg ) populations high risk develop ulceration skin test site . Eighty subject recruit : 20 household contact Borderline Lepromatous Leprosy ( BL ) / Lepromatous Leprosy ( LL ) leprosy patient , 20 BL/LL leprosy patient , 20 Borderline Tuberculoid Leprosy ( BT ) / Tuberculoid Leprosy ( TT ) patient 20 tuberculosis ( TB ) patient . The second part , Stage C-1b , continuation Stage C-1 number subject recruit group assess reactivity antigen low dose ( 0.1 mcg ) . This study define positive skin test reaction MLSA-LAM MLCwA , definition use estimate sensitivity specificity skin test antigen dosage . It expect BT/TT leprosy patient healthy contact leprosy patient large induration M. leprae-derived antigen site variable reaction tuberculin/Purified Protein Derivative ( PPD ) site . The non-contacts , BL/LL leprosy patient , TB patient small induration leprosy skin test site variable reaction tuberculin/PPD site . Finally , TB patient react large induration tuberculin/PPD site . Primary study objective evaluate safety 2 new leprosy skin test antigen estimate specificity sensitivity skin test antigen detect M. leprae infection : selecting dosage MLSA-LAM MLCwA antigens cause minimal induration healthy non-exposed subject ; select size induration serve definition positive skin test reaction MLSA-LAM MLCwA leprosy patient ; compare proportion positive skin test reactor healthy subject proportion BT/TT BL/LL leprosy patient , contact leprosy patient , TB patient . Secondary study objective compare mean size induration response test antigen healthy subject versus BT/TT BL/LL leprosy patient , contact leprosy patient , TB patient measure specificity sensitivity ; compare specificity sensitivity 2 new antigen tuberculin/PPD patient clinical leprosy , contact leprosy patient , healthy unexposed subject ( non-patient contact ) ; quantify release IFN-gamma lymphocyte whole blood leprosy patient , leprosy patient contact , TB patient , healthy nonexposed subject , follow vitro stimulation leprosy skin test antigen PPD , use QuantiFERON-CMI ( Cellestis Limited , Valentia California ) kit . Results compare magnitude skin test response ; determine antibody M. leprae specific anti</detailed_description>
