	<detailed_description>Mathematical modeling suggest cyclic use antiretroviral therapy effective strategy lower viral load HIV-1 infect patient regular triple drug combination lose efficacy due emergence HIV resistance mutation . This open label , crossover pilot study explore safety efficacy rapid cycle regimen antiretroviral combination therapy HIV-1 infect patient virus harbor genotypic resistance least three class antiretroviral therapy . The objective study feasibility , safety efficacy sequential combination therapy HIV-1 infect patient virus harbor genotypic resistance least three class antiretroviral agent currently adequate treatment option available . This open-label , crossover , pilot study . Patients fail current regimen , currently adequate treatment option leave , randomized start either alternate triple combination , start continuous quadruple regimen drug . After 6 week , patient crossover either strategy strategy another 6 week . Each period precede interruption antiretroviral therapy 4 week . In study period regimen alternate , two combination three drug least possible cross-resistance alternate every week .</detailed_description>
