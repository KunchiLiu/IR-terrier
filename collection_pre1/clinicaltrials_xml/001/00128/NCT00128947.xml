	<brief_summary>This study examine people differ way body process eliminate mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , drug use treat problem affect eye immune system prevent organ rejection transplant patient . MMF metabolize group enzyme call UGTs , make different gene . This study investigate whether people different UGT gene differ well body use remove MMF . The result may help scientist learn best way give MMF patient . Normal healthy volunteer 18 55 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , include blood test analysis gene control regulate UGTs . Pregnant woman nurse mother exclude study . Women able child men father child must either abstain sex use two reliable form birth control study 3 month completion . Participants come NIH Clinical Center 6:30 a.m. first day study stay outpatient clinic 12 hour . The next 4 morning , return Clinical Center single blood collection . The procedure 5 day follow : Day 1 Upon arrival Clinical Center catheter insert subject 's arm vein . At 7:00 AM , subject take one dose MMF mouth glass water . Small blood sample collect catheter MMF dose 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 hour take drug . Heart rate blood pressure measure blood collection every 4 hour . After last blood sample collect , volunteer return home . Days 2-5 Volunteers come Clinical Center 7:00 AM study day 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 single blood draw , collect use needle . Volunteers contact telephone 1 , 2 , 3 month complete study see check pregnancy status use appropriate birth control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Mycophenolate Mofetil Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The immunosuppressant mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) metabolize several uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs ) , among UGT1A9 important enzyme . Two commonly occur single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) promoter region UGT1A9 gene show enhance UGT1A9 protein level activity vitro . This study investigate potential vivo effect two SNPs metabolism hence pharmacokinetics MMF metabolite . One hundred thirty healthy volunteer screen presence UGT1A9 C-2152T T-275A polymorphism . Seventeen subject carry variant allele , along 17 others polymorphisms , select participate pharmacokinetic study . Pharmacokinetics metabolites mycophenolic acid ( active ) mycophenolate 7-O-phenolic glucuronide ( inactive ) determine , parameter value compare two group . It hypothesize metabolism MMF enhance subject two SNPs , result increase clearance decrease exposure mycophenolic acid .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Normal healthy volunteer good health determine medical history , physical examination , baseline laboratory test Age 18 55 Both male females Willingness practice effective contraception study three month administration MMF woman sexually active child bear potential , sexually active male potential father child . Barrier nonhormonal method allow study , whereas use oral , injectable , implantable hormone prohibit since drug interaction know occur oral contraceptive mycophenolate mofetil . Subjects able understand sign inform consent form . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Children adolescents less 18 year age Individuals smoke excessive alcohol ( great 1 beer equivalent alcoholic beverage per day ) Pregnant woman nurse mother Subjects certain underlying disease include diabetes , cardiovascular disease , liver disease , cancer , human immunodeficiency virus infection Individuals compromise immune system Subjects active infection Individuals history biliary tract disease , biliary gastrointestinal surgery Subjects persistent diarrhea gastrointestinal problem could impede drug absorption Subjects abnormal liver kidney function determine medication history laboratory evaluation ( AST ALT less equal 2 x upper normal limit , total bilirubin less equal 1 mg/dL , serum creatinine less equal 1.2 mg/dL , hemoglobin great equal 11 g/dL , WBC great equal 3.5 x 10 ( 9 ) /L ) Volunteers chronic prescribe overthecounter medication , dietary herbal supplement within 4 week study participation Subjects take medication could potentially interact MMF pharmacokinetically pharmacodynamically eccinacea , iron preparation , antacid , bileresin cholesterol lower agent , steroid . Volunteers document allergy MMF Prior enrollment similar study within past two month enrollment another study time Subjects felt unwilling unable practice effective contraception method comply protocol specification</criteria>
