	<brief_title>A Study With TMC125 Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Type 1 Infected Patients , Who Were Treated With TMC125 Arm Sponsor-Selected TMC125 Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , roll-over study ( participant may go ahead participate another clinical study ) . Participants randomize ( study medication assign chance ) etravirine ( ETR ) treatment arm Phase II TMC125 feeder study ( TMC125-C203 , TMC125-C209 , TMC125-C223 TMC125-C211 ) , treat least 48 week etravirine , derive continue benefit etravirine therapy , judge investigator , enrol study . The final visit sponsor-selected Phase II ETR study first ( baseline ) visit study . Approximately 300 participant enrol study receive 800 mg twice daily etravirine ( formulation TF035 ) formulation 200 mg twice daily ( formulation F060 ) available . Once formulation become available participant switch receive F060 give combination investigator-selected , optimized underlying therapy ( nucleotide reverse transcriptase [ NRTIs ] and/or allow protease inhibitor and/or enfuvirtide ) . Participants continue receive ETR longer benefit medication becomes commercially available . Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event , clinical laboratory test , electrocardiogram , vital sign , physical examination .</detailed_description>
