	<brief_title>All-Arthroscopic Versus Mini-Open Repair Small Moderate Rotator Cuff Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Rotator cuff tear common source shoulder pain disability . Only poor quality study compare mini-open arthroscopic repair , leave surgeon inadequate evidence support optimal , minimally-invasive repair . Methods/Design : This randomize , multi-centre , national trial determine whether arthroscopic mini-open repair provide good quality life patient small moderate size rotator cuff tear . A national consensus meeting investigator Joints Orthopaedic Initiative Shoulder Trials ( JOINTS ) identify question top priority shoulder surgeon across Canada . The primary outcome measure valid quality-of-life scale ( Western Ontario Rotator Cuff ( WORC ) address 5 domain health affect rotator cuff disease . Secondary outcome assess rotator cuff functionality ( ROM , strength , constant score ) , secondary dimension health ( general health status ( SF-12 ) work limitation ) repair integrity ( MRI ) . Outcomes measured baseline , 6 week , 3 , 6 , 12 24 month postoperatively blind research assistant musculoskeletal radiologist . Patients ( n=250 ) small medium-sized cuff tear identify clinical examination MRI meet eligibility criterion recruit . This sample size provide 80 % power detect ( statistically ) clinically important difference 20 % WORC score procedure control baseline WORC score ( `` =0.05 ) . A central method centre manage randomization , data management monitoring supervision experience epidemiologist . Surgeons participate either conventional expertise-based design accord defined criterion , avoid bias differential surgeon expertise . Mini-open all-arthroscopic repair procedure , perform accord standardize protocol . Central Adjudication ( case ) , Trial Oversight Safety Committees monitor trial conduct . The investigator use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) , baseline WORC score use covariate , compare quality life ( WORC score ) 2-years post-operatively . As secondary analysis investigator conduct statistical test include age tear size covariates baseline score . Enrollment require 2 year follow-up additional 2-years .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The investigator recruit patient small medium rotator cuff tear determine clinical examination diagnostic imaging ( magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) prior surgery . The fullthickness rotator cuff tear supraspinatus infraspinatus classify 2 category base area long dimension . SMALL= 01 cm ; MODERATE =13 cm . Definitive measurement tear size make surgery use covariate analysis . ( JOINTS measurement protocol use ) PreOperative Exclusion Criteria Evidence major joint trauma , infection , avascular necrosis , chronic dislocation , inflammatory degenerative glenohumeral arthropathy , frozen shoulder previous surgery affect shoulder , Evidence significant cuff arthropathy superior humeral translation acromial erosion diagnose xray investigation , Major medical illness ( life expectancy le 2 year unacceptably high operative risk ) , Unable speak read English , Psychiatric illness precludes informed consent , Unwilling follow 2 year . IntraOperative Exclusion Criteria Large , massive irreparable cuff tear , extend subscapularis teres minor , mobilized articular margin repair use one technique ( arthroscopic miniopen ) , Teres minor subscapularis tear , Inelastic immobile tendon , advance articular margin , Coexisting labral pathology require repair suture ( superior labral anterior posterior [ SLAP ] IIIV ) , Bankart lesions require repair , partial tear biceps ( 60 % thickness ) require tenodesis release .</criteria>
