	<brief_summary>This study aim compare whether difference effectiveness upper back ( thoracic spine ) mobilization versus manipulation use population patient mechanical neck pain . The investigator hypothesize patient receive manipulative technique experience well outcomes patient receive mobilization technique result evident 48-hour follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Effectiveness Mobilization Manipulation Thoracic Spine Patients With Mechanical Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients mechanical neck pain meet study 's inclusion criterion , meet study 's exclusion criterion offer opportunity participate study . They issue informed consent detail study time decide whether participate . Once enlisted study complete form assess current functional level . The investigator perform standard clinical exam upper quarter include comprehensive subjective examination , upper extremity strength , reflex , sensory assessment , cervical range motion , thoracic range motion pain assessment . Once data collect patient met criterion study , second investigator choose randomize seal envelope indicate treatment perform . The patient either receive mobilization manipulation thoracic spine . Mobilizations perform prone spinous process T1-T6 . Each one perform 30 second force direct posterioanterior . The manipulation perform supine patient 's arm cross his/her chest . The therapist pull patient 's arm downward create spinal flexion level manipulation occur . The therapist 's manipulative hand stabilize low vertebra motion segment his/her body use push patient 's arm perform high velocity , low amplitude thrust superior vertebra . The manipulation first attempt upper thoracic spine ; cavitation heard first attempt he/she move onto middle thoracic area . If cavitation heard he/she attempt second time move next area . Both area receive maximum two attempt . Once manipulation mobilization perform patient assign one home exercise include rotation cervical spine direction 10 rep , 3-4 time per day . The patient return within 48 hour final data collection include global rating change scale complete therapist patient , pain diagram scale , neck disability index , cervical thoracic range motion measurement , side effect questionnaire . The patient discharge study continue physical therapy deem appropriate time examination .</detailed_description>
