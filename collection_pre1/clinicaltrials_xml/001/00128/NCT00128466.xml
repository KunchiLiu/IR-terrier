	<brief_summary>This clinical trial compare effectiveness streptomycin , historically standard drug treatment plague , gentamicin . The hypothesis gentamicin inferior streptomycin less severe side effect . The study do Madagascar country report plague case world . Patients come participate clinic suspect plague ( bubonic , pneumonic , septicemic ) randomize one two treatment arm give informed consent . Patients monitor side effect improvement symptom . In addition , rapid diagnostic test strip develop fully evaluate use human . The investigator evaluate new test specimens patient , compare performance classical diagnostic method culture serology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol guide clinical trial treatment naturally occur human plague case African country high incidence human plague . The safety efficacy gentamicin compare standard drug regimen already use Madagascar ( streptomycin/co-trimoxazole ) treatment plague . Data trial valuable optimize clinical management plague many country , include Madagascar United States . In collaboration government health official Madagascar , investigator implement randomize , control , non-blinded drug trial compare effectiveness side effect profile gentamicin national standard plague treatment . Cases plague identify clinic-based surveillance area high incidence and/or area experience outbreak recent year . After give informed consent , patient randomly assign one two treatment arm , arm receiving different antimicrobial . One patient group treat gentamicin ; group ( `` control group '' ) receive streptomycin alone co-trimoxazole . This protocol follow national guideline Madagascar Ministry Health , mean patient bubonic plague streptomycin treatment arm receive streptomycin follow trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole . The adaptation enrol patient renal insufficiency receive adjust dose streptomycin , whereas national standard treatment call dose adjustment renal failure . The investigator also evaluate several newly available , rapid `` dipstick '' test diagnosis plague use serum , bubo aspirate , sputum , urine specimen already collect patient enrolled drug trial . These rapid test develop several American company Institut Pasteur Madagascar , fully evaluate use human specimen . These result compare standard diagnostic technique . Such rapid diagnostic test useful plague diagnosis develop nation bioterrorism event .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>2 year age old . Patients must potential exposure rodent and/or fleas contact know plague case . Patients must fever least 38 Â°C develop rapidly , one following : One bubo ( define tender lymph node swell &gt; =1 cm ) appear time fever ; Clinical suspicion pneumonic plague ( prostration , cough , increase respiratory rate , hemoptysis and/or purulent sputum ) ; Clinical suspicion plague AND epidemiological link case . Only patient later confirm standard diagnostic test include final analysis . Patients plague confirmed standard test still include safety analysis . Has sign fit plague meningitis ( severely ill patient sign plague one following : headache , fever , sensorial disturbance , neck back stiffness , and/or positive Kernig Brudzinski sign ) . Has hypotension unresponsive fluid therapy ( i.e . shock ) . In adults hypotension define systolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg heart rate &gt; 110/min ; child need diagnose attend physician medical officer . Has `` illness severity score '' 16 high ( see Patient Record ) Has know allergy gentamicin , streptomycin , trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole Is receive dialysis renal failure Has severe underlie disease hepatic failure severe organ failure Has take tetracycline , quinolones , gentamicin , streptomycin , trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole , chloramphenicol last 24 hour . If patient take medication know , he/she still enrol .</criteria>
