	<brief_summary>Surgery post operative radiotherapy ( PORT ) mainstay treatment advance laryngeal-pharyngeal cancer ( ALHC ) eighth decade past century . Total laryngectomy post-operative radiotherapy ( TL + PORT ) use result permanent tracheostomy loss speech . Early trial like VA European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) trial compare surgery post-operative radiotherapy induction chemotherapy ( ICT ) radiotherapy ( RT ) . Subsequent attempt focus added benefit include concurrent chemotherapy . There randomized trial available literature compare concurrent chemoradiation standard treatment , i.e . surgery follow radiotherapy . However , study compare neoadjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy report well locoregional control rate well survival rate surgery follow post-operative chemotherapy . Further , advance primary voice rehabilitation substantially improve quality life laryngectomy . Thus , strong case compare result concurrent chemo-radiation surgery post-operative radiotherapy randomize clinical trial . This trial answer question - `` whether save voice cost life '' . The investigator propose randomize 900 patient laryngeal hypopharyngeal cancer surgery PORT concomitant chemoradiation arm compare survival locoregional control rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemoradiation Versus Surgery With Adjuvant Therapy Advanced Laryngopharyngeal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TL + PORT traditionally gold standard management ALHC . However , result permanent tracheostomy possible loss speech . In case partial laryngectomy even case TL , various option voice rehabilitation successes procedure highly variable . In 1980s several author report interesting possibility LP ICT . The first randomize study ( RCT ) come VA group randomize patient receive either 2 cycle ICT + RT Vs surgery +PORT . Patients PR receive 3rd cycle follow definitive RT . There local recurrence few distant metastasis ICT arm . Of 166 ICT patient , nearly 1/3rd required salvage TL ultimate LP 66 % survive patient . These result prove ICT definitive RT effective LP without compromise overall survival . European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) study randomly assign hypopharynx cancer patient receive either immediate surgery PORT ( arm 1 ) ICT . Patients CR 2 3 cycle CT treat RT . Locoregional failure occur approximately frequency arm fewer distant failure ICT arm . The median survival find similar arm LPR 35 % ICT arm . This study show feasibility LP patient cancer hypopharynx . A small trial MSKCC15 report 52 % LPR another European RCT report poor survival CT arm LPR 20 % . The latter trial small number patient imbalance randomize group ( 4 5 stage IV patient get randomized CT arm ) could flaw outcome . The 3 RCTs ( exclude MSKCC trial ) compile MACH-NC obtain meta analysis show similar disease free survival non significant trend high 6 % survival pool surgery arm counterbalance LPR 58 % pool CT arm . Quality life measure perform part VA study demonstrate LP offer well speech , good communication skill , less pain depression compare surgery . In three arm study RTOG ( 91-11 ) , incidence laryngectomy 28 % induction ( ICT ) chemotherapy arm , 16 % concomitant arm , 31 % radiation ( RT ) alone arm . Following TL , incidence major minor complication range 52 % 59 % differ significantly among 3 arm . Fistula low RT alone arm ( 15 % ) high concomitant arm ( 30 % ) . Similar experience report MSKCC fistula occur 39 % , result prolonged hospitalization . When compare complication rate surgery untreated patient , complication rate follow unsuccessful LP protocol significantly high . In spite high morbidity , local-regional control excellent group patient . In RTOG trial , local-regional control follow SS 74 % CT arm 90 % RT alone arm . At 24 month , overall survival equal arm . The necessity add chemotherapy radiotherapy debatable . The MACH -NC report 4 % improvement overall survival 2 5 yr CT . So prevent death 400 patient 5 year , 10,000 patient would undergo CT . In O'Sullivan ' questionnaire base study , apart extent disease significant variable influence treatment recommendation physician specialty geographical area practice . Most LP protocol often accompany increased toxicity generally achieve good performance status patient unlike majority head neck cancer patient . In VA trial , 77 % patient Karnofsky performance score ( KPS ) 80 RTOG 91-11 trial , 2/3 patient KPS 90 . In RTOG trial , mucosal toxicity concurrent CT+RT arm twice much mucosal toxicity two arm . High grade toxic effect occur CT add RT significant difference rate toxic effect concurrent arm ICT arm . Incidence treatment modification , treatment interruption hospitalization higher ( compare RT alone ) CT administer concomitantly alter fractionation due complication mucositis , dysphagia , pain , desquamation etc . The indirect cost attributable non-surgical approach e.g frequent expensive imaging , duration treatment , duration recuperation , cost chemotherapy drug , enhance need supportive care , stringent follow salvage surgery ( one third half patient ) may cost radical surgery . Careful monitoring conservatively treated patient mandatory allow early salvage failure ( VA trial , induction CT arm local recurrence 2 % patient lose follow-up ) . Given infirmity poor compliance head neck cancer patient stringent follow-up appear difficult ( VA trial patient follow every month 1st year ) . Nearly 40-60 % patient fail LPP predict failure spar patient unnecessary chemoradiation toxicity , trauma recurrent disease complication salvage surgery . Mutation p53 gene find regulate cell proliferation chemosensitivity . LP significantly high group patient whose tumor express p53 predict survival . A retrospective study nest within VA study report T stage , p53 over-expression elevate proliferate cell nuclear antigen index independent predictor successful LP . Success RT depend kill clonogenic cell increase linearly tumor volume ( TV ) . Lesions classify T3 T4 despite wide variation TV one perform volumetric analysis . TV one precise relevant predictor RT outcome . This inverse relationship may explain basis hypoxia due central tumor necrosis detrimental CT well RT . Cartilage invasion , soft tissue extension , volume , extensive nodal involvement , pre epiglottic space invasion , paraglottic space invasion arytenoid infiltration radiological parameter predict poor outcome RT . Recent study show adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation emerge standard care high risk tumor provide estimate five year progression free survival benefit 11 % advanced stage III IV tumor even early stage tumor extranodal spread , positive resection margin , perineural involvement vascular embolization . A similar study RTOG show estimate 10 % improvement two year locoregional control high risk tumor multiple lymphnodal involvement , extranodal spread positive resection margin . To sum , CT+RT advantage potential radiosensitization chemotherapy induce cell cycle redistribution , overcome radio-resistance within field RT , target different subpopulation cell lead kill , reduction delay distant metastasis . Its disadvantage increase expense , enhance toxicity need good interdisciplinary integration . What need appreciate fact CT+RT never evaluate standard treatment TL + PORT . Although quality life report good laryngeal preservation , speech rehabilitation improve steadily past decade . Time seem ripe compare LP CT+RT TL+PORT speech rehabilitation locoregional control quality life endpoint . DETAILED STUDY PLAN : Study type : Prospective randomized control trial 900 patient ( 450 arm ) . Trial size calculate 392 event expect improvement base line survival 42 % 10 % ( alpha error 0.05 power 80 ) . RANDOMIZATION Arm 1 : Radiation Therapy+ CDDP Arm 2 : Surgery + Post operative RT ( + CDDP high risk case ) Arms 1 2 : Cisplatin ( CDDP ) 100 mg/m2 20-30 minute day 1 , 22 , 43 . In arm 2 Cisplatin ( CDDP ) 100 mg/m2 give patient multiple lymphnodal involvement , extranodal spread , positive resection margin , perineural involvement vascular embolization . Surgery : Near total/Total Laryngectomy bilateral neck dissection primary speech rehabilitation either myo-mucosal shunt ( NTL ) primary tracheo-esophageal puncture .</detailed_description>
