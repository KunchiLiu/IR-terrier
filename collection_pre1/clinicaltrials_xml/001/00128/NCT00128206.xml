	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether alternative drug , ( rifampin ) give daily , good treat tuberculosis ( TB ) tolerable usual drug treatment , isoniazid ( INH ) . Study participant include 972 , TB infect , San Francisco Jail inmate , age 18 old . One group volunteer take INH two time week 9 month , group take rifampin daily 4 month . Medication administer jail San Francisco TB Clinic volunteer release jail prior complete study . Participants see daily 4 month ( rifampin group ) , 2 time week 9 month ( INH group ) directly observe therapy . Study procedures include 5 symptom review visit blood sample lab test . Follow-up continue subject five year enrollment study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Latent TB Infection Jailed Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose project evaluate effect two accept regimen treat latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) jail . Tuberculosis ( TB ) incarcerate population continue serious problem , due large proportion person high risk latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) develop active disease . Completion treatment LTBI , important component overall TB control effort , successful jail . This primarily inmates frequently release finishing 6-9 month course standard therapy , low rate complete therapy community . This study propose look toxicity adherence 4-month regimen compare nine-month regimen isoniazid ( INH ) , examine cost , cost deliver care cost TB disease prevent , examination reason completion noncompletion therapy . Short-course therapy LTBI may address problem expensive study adequately answer question side effect , completion rate , overall cost . The investigator propose randomize trial test effect short course therapy , rifampin ( 600 mg orally ) give daily 4 month , compare ( INH ) ( 900 mg orally ) give twice weekly 9 month . Both regimen list Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) American Thoracic Society acceptable treatment person LTBI . The study participant include 972 San Francisco Jail inmate , 18 year old , enrol 28-month period , sample 486 study group . Subjects , follow jail release , follow test three hypothesis : null hypothesis difference toxicity rifampin compare INH within 95 % confidence interval ( .4-1.87 ) difference study group adherence cost-effectiveness . A secondary aim describe reason completion noncompletion therapy . Toxicity define complication lead stop drug . Adherence define completion care , 120 dos take within 6 month rifampin group 76 dos INH take within 12 month INH group . Cost effectiveness calculate total cost care ( nursing , medical , laboratory , well facility cost ) , measure cost TB case prevent . All treatment administer directly observe therapy ( DOT ) jail , DOT release San Francisco TB Clinic . Counseling adherence ( go TB Clinic release complete therapy ) possible side effect give study subject enrollment follow-up clinic visit . All subject routinely evaluate study personnel every two week first 6 week , thereafter detect possible drug toxicity include hepatitis , peripheral neuropathy , arthralgia , rash , memory loss , clinical symptom . All patient undergo laboratory assessment regular interval accord schedule compare study group participation usual care jail . All blood test result , new symptom change symptoms find follow-up , add jail medical record . A final interview do subject time complete completed course therapy LTBI , determine reason ( barrier enablers ) . Follow-up continue subject five year enrollment study , measure study endpoint ( completion care , take drug toxicity loss follow-up ) measure subsequent treatment LTBI development active TB record review .</detailed_description>
