	<brief_title>Improving Coronary Prevention County Health System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Evidence extensive population study clinical trial show effectiveness risk factor management reduce morbidity mortality coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . These study generate important national clinical practice guideline . Current prevention practice , however , fall short attain goal recommend national guideline . These shortfall lead unnecessary CAD disease burden , well perpetuation socioeconomic disparity . Case management prove augment current CAD prevention activity improve adherence national guideline . The Stanford Health Education Risk Reduction Training ( HEAR2T ) program innovative , yet well-tested , case management tool evaluate study . HEAR2T develop evaluate several study Stanford . It base upon social cognitive model Bandura use case manager work intensely patient educate change overall behavior relate health . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Stanford Health Education Risk Reduction Training ( HEAR2T ) program evaluate high-risk population low socioeconomic status ( SES ) serve county health care system San Mateo County ( SMC ) , California . The study : 1 ) enhance HEAR2T program use low-SES population ; 2 ) implement program integral part clinical care ; 3 ) implement randomize control trial evaluate effectiveness HEAR2T lower aggregate CAD risk ; 4 ) determine HEAR2T diminish socioeconomic disparity ; 5 ) estimate HEAR2T 's cost effectiveness ; 6 ) transition intervention research study ongoing County CAD case management program . The primary outcome measure change aggregate CAD risk score , calculate Framingham model base individual CAD risk factor . The primary hypothesis patient case-management via HEAR2T model produce favorable change aggregate CAD risk score compare control patient usual care . An estimated 200 intervention 200 usual care patient enrol four health center SMC system . Usual care patient crossover intervention 15 month , allow additional assessment intervention 's impact . Continued follow-up participant assess durability risk change achieve initial intensive case-management . This study make critical innovative contribution define optimal disease management low-SES population .</detailed_description>
