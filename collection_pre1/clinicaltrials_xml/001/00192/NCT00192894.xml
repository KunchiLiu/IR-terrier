	<detailed_description>The incidence hypotension onset spinal anesthesia elderly patient vary 27 % 80 % depend definition use . Studies cardiac output ( CO ) show maintain slightly decrease . Unfortunately , time-resolution study often several minute , description change consequently often start-to-end relation rather description dynamic change onset spinal anesthesia . A recent advance measure CO LiDCOTMplus hemodynamic monitor , prove reliable compare pulmonary artery catheter various intensive care setting . This monitor allow beat-to-beat measure various procedure thus early warn hemodynamic event . Another method potential early warning decrease perfusion near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . NIRS use continuous non-invasive monitoring cerebral oxygen saturation ( ScO2 ) even small reduction recently show predict maternal hypotension caesarian section . The aim study describe change CO onset spinal anesthesia elderly patient use method high time-resolution . We also attempt evaluate NIRS predictor hemodynamic event .</detailed_description>
