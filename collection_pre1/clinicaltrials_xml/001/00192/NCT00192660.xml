	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral medication , use treat HIV infection , cause side effect . These include change composition fat throughout body ( loss area accumulation others ) , elevation blood lipid abnormality glucose metabolism . The resulting syndrome know `` HIV associate lipodystrophy '' HIVLD . In HIV negative population , abnormality lipid glucose metabolism associate increase risk develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The aim study characterize change occur body composition metabolism antiretroviral treatment compare change fat tissue structure function surrogate marker cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
