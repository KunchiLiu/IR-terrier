	<brief_summary>This study examine whether food cost-effective method improve treatment compliance TB patient Timor Leste . Our hypothesis provision locally available , locally acceptable , cheap highly nutritious food clinic encourage patient come daily directly observe treatment , thus improve chance TB cure decrease chance development TB drug resistance . Primary outcome successful completion treatment secondary outcome include treatment compliance clinical biological measure nutritional improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Food Incentives TB Treatment Compliance East Timor ( FITTCET )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct randomise control trial food intervention improve compliance East Timor . Patients diagnose usual way give opportunity enrol study . Consenting individual randomise receive intervention ( meal clinic daily first two month treatment food parcel fortnightly six month treatment ) standard care ( nutritional advice ) . The primary outcome TB cure rate secondary outcome include response treatment ( weight gain , decrease symptom , sputum clearance ) percentage day attend clinic . In conjunction study TB treatment compliance collect blood sample measure micro-nutrient change response food intervention . A cost-effectiveness analysis intervention also perform . We plan pilot study three urban clinic Dili establish feasibility provide pilot data funding application , intervention improve compliance , funding application successful , expand project include rural district conjunction National TB Control Program . Ultimately , health outcome address project improve control tuberculosis high burden , low income setting . Better compliance tuberculosis treatment community level contribute process . TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSES The specific objective project : 1 . Design locally appropriate food intervention improve adherence TB treatment TB treatment outcome East Timor ; 2 . Conduct study intervention three clinic Dili . If pilot study successful , use experience pilot data obtain fund generalise intervention rural clinic well . 3 . Food incentive achievable , effective method encourage full adherence DOTS thus improve cure rate East Timor ; 4 . Locally available , whole food supplement cost-effective intervention improve cure rate East Timor ; 5 . Lessons learn East Timor adaptable setting part world . TRIAL DESIGN Expected Outcomes measurement : 1 . To show statistically significant difference treatment success ( cure rate ) intervention control arm . We assess sputum clearance , treatment compliance treatment completion rate compare two group . 2 . To show effectiveness food supplementation improve compliance treatment . In intensive phase treatment ( usually first two month ) , compare observe versus expect daily visit clinic , compliance daily medication default rate intervention control arm . In continuation phase treatment ( usually 6 month ) , compare observe versus expect fortnightly visit clinic , daily medication diary default rate two group . 3 . To show statistically significant difference nutritional status intervention arm control arm . We measure clinical improvement , sputum clearance ( sputum smear positive patient ) , gain BMI , change bio-impedence improvement level micronutrient group . 4 . To demonstrate cost-effectiveness intervention improve TB control East Timor . Randomisation Patients randomly assign receive one two intervention : food supplement nutritional advice ( standard care ) . The random assignment intervention group provide statistician Menzies School Health Research . The random allocation sequence computer-generated ( Stata Version 8.0 ) conceal investigator throughout study . Allocation stratify community health clinic TB diagnosis ( sputum smear positive ) . Block randomisation use maintain similar number participant intervention group minimise potential influence time enrolment . The random allocation seal envelope two box ( smear positive ) clinic . Prior open envelope , research assistant complete randomisation form check patient eligible enrolment , obtain informed consent complete enrolment questionnaire . The research assistant inform local investigator name patient , time randomisation randomisation number . Outcome Assessment 1 . The primary outcome measure proportion patient successfully complete eight month course TB treatment achieve cure group ( treatment success ) proportion patient complete treatment ( defaulter ) persistent disease ( treatment failure ) . The primary analysis intention treat . All participant study contribute outcome analysis . 2 . Secondary analysis conduct evaluate proportion clinic visit compare expected response treatment measure : symptom ( cough , sputum , fever ) ; change weight , BMI bio-impedence ; sputum clearance ; micronutrient measurement . 3 . The primary outcome ( treatment success ) determine independent observer ( base Darwin ) blind intervention receive patient .</detailed_description>
