	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral medication , use treat HIV infection , cause side effect . These include change way fat lay body . This result fat loss part body , fat deposit site , give characteristic look know `` HIV associate lipodystrophy '' HIVLD . With change , also abnormalities glucose fat metabolism ( collectively term metabolic abnormality ) . In HIV negative population , metabolic change associate increase risk develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The aim study investigate change body 's handle fat glucose occur short course treatment HIV negative subject correlate increase risk CVD .</detailed_description>
