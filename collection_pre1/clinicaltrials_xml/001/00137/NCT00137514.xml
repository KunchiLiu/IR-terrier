	<detailed_description>This study compare treatment uncomplicated malaria child Guinea-Bissau recommend national malaria programme ( chloroquine total dose 25 mg/kg ) , either total dose 50 mg/kg chloroquine total dose 15 30 mg amodiaquine . As annual vitro study ( 1992 2004 except 1998 , 1999 ) several in-vivo study Guinea-Bissau indicate fairly stable chloroquine resistance prevalence , another aim study evaluate genetic basis chloroquine resistance Guinea-Bissau analyze specific single nucleotide polymorphism pfcrt pfmdr1 blood sample vivo trial . Following consent participate , child visit Bandim Health Centre outskirts Bissau mono-infection Plasmodium falciparum block-randomization allocate one four different treatment group . The treatment give supervise one health worker . The child visit malaria film obtain day 2 day 7 weekly day 35 . On day seven , 100 microliters capillary blood drawn analyse chloroquine amodiaquine concentration whole blood . Whenever child recurrent parasitaemia , filter-paper blood-sample collect later PCR analysis . If parasite reappear 50 % least 40 child one treatment group treatment arm terminate . During study parent recommend bring child Bandim Health Centre case illness . Participating child examine treated free charge . Following recommendation national Malaria Programme sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine use re-treatment child case recrudescence . The result study could use give needed new recommendation treatment malaria Guinea-Bissau . If still effective mono-therapy high dose chloroquine could use introduction well treatment possible . When artemisinine combination therapy go introduce Guinea-Bissau result could helpful decide amodiaquine consider partner drug - dose .</detailed_description>
