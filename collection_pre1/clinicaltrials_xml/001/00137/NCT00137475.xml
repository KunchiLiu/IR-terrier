	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy primary treatment modality important adjunct treatment many patient H &amp; N carcinoma . Local control directly relate dose technical accuracy dose deliver target volume . Traditional radiotherapy technique result significant dos deliver normal tissue adjacent target , include spinal cord salivary gland . This leave patient significant acute late normal tissue toxicity impact ability tolerate actual treatment patient 's long-term quality life . Recently , use static conformal multisegmental intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) comprehensive irradiation head neck cancer dose spar uninvolved tissue . This result substantial preservation major salivary gland function many patient primary site oral pharynx , oral cavity , nasopharynx , pyriform sinus . While result date show promising preservation salivary flow , know whether patient treat IMRT similar local control rate treat standard radiotherapy . Some investigator raise concern give low radiation dose area adjacent target volume risk undertreating disease . On hand , IMRT deliver protocol ( call `` simultaneous integrate boost '' , SIB ) may improve local control rate deliver biologically effective dose short overall time period ( see ) . This phase I/II trial seek establish efficacy IMRT H &amp; N cancer treatment , investigate relationship radiation dose parotid gland , salivary flow , quality life . The specific objectives trial follow : - To assess local control rate survival patient treat intensity-modulated radiotherapy use simultaneous integrate boost ( SIB ) region high risk recurrence ; - To determine pattern failure patient treat IMRT+SIB ; - To assess incidence chronic grade 2 xerostomia parotid-sparing IMRT use RTOG grade scale ; - To assess quality life patient IMRT use subjective xerostomia questionnaire University Washington Quality Life Head Neck Symptom Questionnaire ; - To assess quantitative change salivary function IMRT use sialometry ( unstimulated stimulate whole salivary flow rate ) . Patients squamous cell carcinoma H &amp; N eligible provide 18 year ' age , AJCC stage I-IV M0 N0-2 disease , KPS &gt; =70 % . Ineligibility criterion include previous cancer H &amp; N radiotherapy , salivary gland dysfunction , unwilling provide inform consent . Methodology : All patient accrue study series pre-treatment evaluation , include history , physical , KPS evaluation , CT/MRI head neck , chest x-ray CT , dental examination , QOL assessment use University Washington QOL H &amp; N symptom questionnaire ( Hassan et al , 1993 ) , pre-treatment salivary flow measurement . All salivary flow measurement collect study include unstimulated ( rest ) stimulate ( use citric acid solution ) , 5-minute collection time . Accrued patient belong one two cohort , determine radiotherapy target volume dose level : Group 1 - Patients treat definitive radiotherapy ( chemoradiotherapy ) . The high dose region ( PTV66 ) consist area gross disease plus appropriate planning margin . The low dose region ( PTV54 ) include PTV66 at-risk draining lymphatics neck . Group 2 - Patients treat surgery post-operative radiotherapy . The high-dose region ( PTV60 ) consist area previous gross disease region neck metastatic lymph node involvement . The low-dose region ( PTV54 ) include PTV60 plus remainder surgical bed additional regional lymphatic tissue consider risk harbor occult disease . All patient treat 30 treatment ( 1 treatment per day , 5 day per week , 6 week ) . PTV66 receive 66 Gy , PTV54 receive 54 Gy , etc . Thus different target region receive different dos per day ( range 1.8 2.2 ) . In theory , give high-risk region higher dose per day ( hypofractionation ) allow tumour cell le time repopulate improve control rate ( Fowler , 2000 ) . Investigations treatment : Patients weekly toxicity assessment radiotherapy . Follow-up completion RT include history/physical , QOL assessment , salivary flow collection . These assessment do 4 , 8 , 12 week , every 1.5 month 1 year . Follow-up beyond 1 year physician 's discretion normally involve visit every 3-4 month . Statistical consideration : The sample size trial base expected local control rate similar patient treated standard radiotherapy . For group 1 ( patient treat definitive radiotherapy ) difficult predict priori expect heterogeneity stage primary site accrue patient . However , stage I-II patient treat RT alone , select stage III patient treat chemoradiotherapy 2-year local control rate 70-80 % . For group 2 ( patient treat surgery high-risk feature necessitate post-op RT ) , expect local control rate also approximately 70 % . Assuming power 70 % , significance 5 % , historical rate local control 75 % ( combine ) , require number patient detect 10 % change local control 120.7 . We therefore accrue 120 patient , anticipated rate 2-3 patient per month 2-4 year .</detailed_description>
