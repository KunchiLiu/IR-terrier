	<brief_summary>This study use various method measure activity motor cortex ( part brain control movement ) order learn focal hand dystonia . Patients dystonia muscle spasm cause uncontrolled twist repetitive movement abnormal posture . In focal dystonia , one part body , hand , neck face , involve . Patients focal hand dystonia healthy normal volunteer 18 65 year age may eligible study . Each candidate screen medical history , physical examination questionnaire . Participants undergo follow procedure : Finger Movement Tasks Subjects perform two finger movement task . In first part study , move index finger repetitively side side 10-second interval total 200 movement four block 50 time . In second part study , subject touch thumb four finger sequence 1 , 2 , 3 4 , metronome beat 2 time per second help time movement . This sequence repeat total 200 movement four block 50 time . Electroencephalography This test record brain wave . Electrodes ( metal disc ) place scalp electrode cap , paste glue-like substance . The space electrodes scalp fill gel conduct electrical activity . Brain wave record subject performs finger movement task , describe . Magnetoencephalography MEG record magnetic field change produce brain activity . During test , subject seat MEG record room cone contain magnetic field detector lower onto head . The recording may make subject performs finger task . Electromyography Electromyography ( EMG ) measure electrical activity muscle . This study use surface EMG , small metal disk fill conductive gel tap skin finger . Magnetic resonance imaging MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . The patient lie table slide scanner ( narrow metal cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan . Most scan last 45 90 minute . Subjects may ask lie still 30 minute time , communicate MRI staff time procedure . Questionnaire This questionnaire design detect source discomfort subject may experience study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Dystonia disable movement disorder manifest sustain co-contraction agonist antagonist muscle , give rise abnormal twisted posture overflow muscle activity . Abnormal neurophysiologic parameter somatosensory motor cortex demonstrate , although unclear change lead predominant motor manifestation . In normal voluntary movement , communication sensory motor cortex important interaction may dysfunctional dystonia . Coherence powerful method use assess brain communication instrumental demonstrate interregional interaction involve normal movement . Inappropriate connectivity term duration communication extent spread sensorimotor area may give rise involuntary overflow movement characterize dystonia . We propose examine change coherence associate disorganized movement yield insight brain network involve development expression disease . Study population Patients focal hand dystonia normal volunteer take part study . Design In study , EEG/MEG coherence analysis use investigate corticocortical corticomuscular interaction voluntary hand movement focal hand dystonia patient normal subject . Power spectral change beta alpha frequency range hand sensorimotor cortex study use 28-channel EEG montage subject perform various task involve hand . The interregional coherence sensory motor , premotor motor , interhemispheric cortex assess change study population . Outcome Measures Comparison interregional coherence change perform dystonia patient normal volunteer well affect unaffected side . Furthermore , coherence change compare rest task performance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Normal subject : Healthy volunteer age 18 old consent participate study Patients age 18 older diagnose focal hand dystonia unilateral focal hand dystonia consent participate study EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Normal subject : abnormal neurologic exam history previous neurological disease might affect function hand Dystonia patient : presence second neurologic disease condition might affect function hand ; abnormal neurologic finding exam related focal hand dystonia might affect function hand ; use Botulinum toxin within 3 month prior study participation For MRI study , patient metallic implant exclude avoid potential risk procedure For MRI study , woman pregnant excluded part protocol . All woman childbearing potential pregnancy test perform prior MRI study , must negative , proceed .</criteria>
