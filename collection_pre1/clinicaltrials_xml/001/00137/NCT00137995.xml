	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate efficacy safety induction therapy R-ICE comparison R-DHAP 3 cycle adjust successful mobilization stem cell patient previously treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma CD20 . The goal detect difference mobilization adjust response rate 15 % R-ICE R-DHAP . The objective evaluate efficacy safety MabThera maintenance therapy transplantation measure event free survival . The goal obtain 15 % increase event free survival 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In vitro , addition rituximab standard anticancer drug increase cell lysis even chemoresistant cell line . This chemosensitization effect also demonstrate vivo result GELA trial elderly patient DLCL . Reported phase II study result RICE regimen treatment patient relapse DLCL comparison historical control treat ICE suggests effect ( 15 % improvement response rate ) likely relapse DLCL lead SWOG stop randomize trial compare ICE v RICE patient relapse aggressive lymphoma . In set relapsed DLCL , high dose therapy ( HDT ) follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) remain standard improve survival highly select chemosensitive patient . In Parma study , 58 % patient relapse aggressive NHL good responder DHAP 24 % complete remission . Moreover , quality response depend prognostic factor IPI relapse &gt; 12 month treatment , patient respond salvage therapy benefit HDT + ASCT . As show PARMA study . The goal relapse DLCL improve complete response rate transplantation main parameter eligibility HDT + ASCT main prognostic factor . Unlike first line treatment CHOP , standard chemotherapy exists relapse patient . DHAP frequently use regimen decade incorporates two drug , dose-limiting renal toxicity . The ICE regimen develop several dosage study consistently produce CR rate 10-15 % superior DHAP . It expect difference remain addition rituximab regimen . Recent phase II data patient relapse DLCL previously treat rituximab show RICE produce response rate 78 % complete remission rate 58 % active primary refractory disease well intermediate-high risk patient ( IPI 2-3 ) . Association DHAP Rituximab , R-DHAP do small series patient investigator , include patient relapse autotransplant . Despite numerous phase II study , randomize study perform compare two regimen ( DHAP/ICE ) others relapse DLCL . Treatment first line DLCL change past 10 year intensive regimen , often follow ASCT , recently addition rituximab chemotherapy therefore population relapse patient might different one initial PARMA study . A large lymphoma intergroup study work large prospective data base might help find best salvage regimen assess role retreatment monoclonal antibody patient . Finally , role rituximab maintenance therapy HDT + ASCT prolong second complete response evaluate .</detailed_description>
