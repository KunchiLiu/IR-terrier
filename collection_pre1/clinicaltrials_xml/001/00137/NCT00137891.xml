	<brief_summary>Forty-six ( 46 ) eligible , healthy subject provide write informed consent enrol participate 2 arm parallel group study assess compare pharmacokinetics safety profile Thyrogen dose 0.1 mg versus modify release formulation recombinant human thyroid stimulate hormone ( rhTSH ) dose 0.1 mg . Ten ( 10 ) subject thyroid uptake radioiodine ( 123I ) measure baseline follow single dose study medication . All dos administer via intramuscular ( IM ) injection . Following confirmation study eligibility , subject randomized 1:1 ratio receive either single administration 0.1 mg Thyrogen ( THYR ) 0.1 mg modify release . Randomization stratify whether patient thyroid uptake radioiodine ( 123I ) measure follow single dose study medication . Five ( 5 ) patient treatment arm uptake measure , 18 arm . Each subject blood sample take determine pharmacokinetics serum TSH -12 hour prior dose various hour 14 day follow administration Thyrogen modify release formulation . In addition , evaluation pharmacodynamics , subject sample blood take determine serum free T4 , total T4 , free T3 , total T3 -12 hour prior dose various hour 14 day follow administration study treatment . All subject undergo 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) prior dose administration 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 10 14 day follow study treatment administration . In addition , subject undergo 24 hour Holter monitor baseline four ( 4 ) consecutive 24-hour Holter monitoring session post treatment yield total 96 hour continuous monitor cardiac function follow treatment administration . All subject undergo ultrasound evaluation determine thyroid volume baseline 48 hour follow treatment administration . Twenty-four hour follow administration Thyrogen modify release formulation , subset five ( 5 ) subject treatment arm receive dose 123I prepared 400ÂµCi day radioiodine administration base utilized nuclear pharmacy 's calibration schedule . Thyroid gland uptake measure via probe 10 subject 6 , 24 48 hour follow radioiodine administration . Blood chemistry , complete blood count ( CBC ) , urinalysis physical exam conduct 14 day treatment administration , time early termination , final safety assessment . Each subject 's duration study participation approximately 4 week .</brief_summary>
