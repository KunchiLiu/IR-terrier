	<brief_summary>As poliovirus eradication progress rapidly , strategy discontinue oral poliovirus vaccination need establish . One strategy would use inactivated poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) transitionally , already occur United States . It clear , however , 3 dos IPV provide sufficient immunogenicity administer accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) /Expanded Programme Immunization ( EPI ) schedule tropical , develop area wild-poliovirus circulates . Puerto Rico study site randomize clinical trial . Healthy infant identify birth hospital-system , enrol within 4 week birth , randomize one two arm : United States America ( U.S.A. ) schedule ( 8 , 16 , 24 weeks/2 , 4 , 6 month ) WHO schedule ( 6 , 10 , 14 week ) . Both group receive IPV visit 1 , 2 3 . Infants receive age-appropriate EPI childhood vaccination along IPV , decrease confusion inconvenience parent . Serum collect twice , visit 1 visit 4 ( 30-45 day IPV-3 ) , measure antibody titer . Sera measure neutralizing antibody Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) . Based low seroconversion rate estimate 85 % , probability .80 estimate study error 10 % , investigator need enroll 220 infant arm . To compensate attrition retain statistical power , investigator plan enroll 250 infant arm . This study expect require least 20 month complete . Results provide valuable timely information applicable global polio eradication effort . Any participant found protect 3 dos IPV give booster 9-12 month . Results provide valuable timely information applicable global polio eradication effort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Immune Response Using 2 Vaccination Schedules Using Inactivated Polio Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study prospective , randomized clinical trial immunogenicity IPV among two group infant use different immunization schedule ( WHO/EPI US ) . Study begin enrollment period 10 month . All infant bear San Lucas Hospital eligible unless otherwise exclude . The study continue 10 month last infant enrol . There four five study visit , depend cohort . Study Population : Infants identify birth San Lucas Hospital ; baby bear enrollment period select hospital consider eligible . Mothers approach hospital study -nurse infant ’ birth inform study . Inclusion exclusion criterion assess time mother agree study , inform consent obtain . Randomization base day baby bear . Even day assign WHO schedule odd day US schedule . The mother tell cohort infant give immunization card date infant return receive vaccination . The card also include study contact phone number . The study implement Ponce School Medicine San Lucas Hospital Ponce Puerto Rico . This teach hospital 24 bed well-baby nursery approximately 150 baby bear per month . Interventions : To avoid confusion , inconvenience error , limit difference among participant , DTaP , Hib , PCV , HepB ( appropriate ) administer along IPV first 3 visit cohort . Both schedule meet parameter Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) ( minimum interval least 4 week dose minimum age 6 week age ) 2 . Cohort A—WHO/EPI Schedule Initial Study Visit : Visit 1 schedule 6 week ( &gt; 42 day &lt; 46 day ) birth . Blood drawn ( sera 1 ) immediately prior administration first dose IPV recommend vaccine . Mother remind infant ’ next appointment 4 week . Study Visit 2 : Visit 2 schedule 4 week last vaccination ( &gt; 28 day &lt; 32 day ) . The 2nd dose IPV recommend vaccine administer time . Mother remind infant ’ next appointment 4 week . Study Visit 3 : Visit 3 schedule 4 week last vaccination ( &gt; 28 day &lt; 32 day ) . The 3rd dose IPV recommend vaccine administer time . Mother remind infant ’ next appointment 4 week . Study Visit 4 : Visit 4 schedule 4 week last vaccination . A blood sample drawn participant . Study visit take place earlier 28 day since previous vaccination later 45th day Study Visit 5 : According ACIP recommendation 3rd dose Hepatitis B administer 6 month age . For reason , Visit 5 schedule child 24 week age order receive 3rd dose Hepatitis B vaccine . Cohort B—US Schedule Initial Study Visit : Visit 1 schedule 8 week birth ( &gt; 52 day &lt; 60 day ) . Blood drawn ( sera 1 ) immediately prior administration first dose IPV recommend vaccine . Mother remind infant ’ next appointment 8 week . Study Visit 2 : Visit 2 schedule 8 week last vaccination ( &gt; 52 day &lt; 60 day ) . The 2nd dose IPV recommend vaccine administer . Mother remind infant ’ next appointment 8 week . Study Visit 3 : Visit 3 schedule 8 week last vaccination ( &gt; 52 day &lt; 60 day ) . The 3rd dose IPV recommend vaccine administer time . Mother remind infant ’ next appointment 4 week . Study Visit 4 : Visit 4 schedule 4 week last vaccination . A blood sample drawn participant . Study visit take place earlier 28 day since previous vaccination later 45th day . Specimens Collection/Handling : Blood drawn obtain serum neutralize antibody titer prior first dose IPV subsequent 3rd dose IPV . If &gt; = 2 % child either arm respond 3 type poliovirus , two additional blood specimen offer test immunity 4th dose IPV among non responder . A minimum 500 µl collect bleed preferably via vein use 23-25 gauge butterfly vacutainer tube ( heel stick acceptable infant note poor venous access ) . Specimens label unique identifier keep cold ( 2-8° C ) , frozen , specimen spun serum separate do end day ( specimens sit &gt; 12 hour ) . Sera aliquoted batch-stored –20° C. A batch frozen shipment dry ice make CDC Phase 1 ( participant study visit complete ) . Lab Evaluation Methods : Sera test level neutralize antibody titer poliovirus type 1 , 2 3 CDC mean modify microneutralization assay 13 . Approximately 80 100 median tissue culture infective dose ( TCID50 ) vaccine virus serotype serial dilution serum ( start 1:8 end 1:1024 ) incubate 37° C 2.5 hour 7.5x103 Hep-2 ( C ) cell add well . After incubation 5 day 37° C , plate stain 0.05 % crystal violet 25 % ethyl alcohol , optical density well measure spectrophotometer . Each specimen run triplicate , final titer estimate method Karber . Seropositivity define neutralization titer  1:8 . It estimate serology result available 60 day receipt specimens CDC . Analysis : This study design examine compare seroconversion response IPV give accord WHO/EPI US schedule . Our primary interest determine whether seroconversion rate among child receive WHO/EPI schedule lower 10 % less rate among use US schedule . To determine require number study participant , assume seroconversion rate use US schedule 85 % want power .80 find significant difference rate rate among WHO/EPI schedule group 75 % low . Using one-tailed test ( realize one-sided significance level uncommon epidemiologic study give u confidence level 90 % standard 95 % ) base normal approximation binomial distribution , sample size ~220 subject per arm satisfy criterion . To compensate expect attrition ~14 % , goal 250 infant set arm . Study Drug : IPV FDA license drug . No investigational drug use purpose study . No routine vaccination withhold purpose study . Those participant randomize WHO/EPI schedule receive vaccine different time schedule would usually follow Puerto Rico . However , schedule meet parameter Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) 2 . Because participant follow closely 6 month life , likely receive vaccination timely manner might part study . Parents give unique immunization card show schedule infant follow ; vaccine administer record . The card indicate enrol study list study staff name contact telephone number . Informed Consent Procedures : Prior infant vaccination , parent give standard vaccine information statement ( VIS ) inform consent Spanish English , would immunize child pediatrician health clinic . Information risk administer vaccine discuss study inform consent , form would overwhelmingly long . Confidentiality : Confidentiality assure keep identify material lock cabinet lock office . All personal identifier remove data specimen ship CDC . Records hold confidential full extent allow state federal law . Information collect study include minimum degree sensitive personal information form demographic data . Its disclosure pose negligible risk participant or/parent . Parents provide usual write information discuss pros con vaccine administer .</detailed_description>
