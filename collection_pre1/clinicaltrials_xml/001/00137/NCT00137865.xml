	<brief_summary>Ovarian cancer may cause build-up genetic defect , damage gene within cell body . Because gene damage , body unable produce group proteins call cytokine use immune system fight cancer infection . The investigational gene transfer agent EGEN-001 ( phIL-12-005/PPC ) contain human gene interleukin-12 [ IL-12 ] ( cytokine ) special carrier system design enter cell help body produce cytokine . This study two purpose ; first determine different strength EGEN-001 give safely without major side effect , second see EGEN-001 able slow growth ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study phIL-12-005/PPC Treat Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EGEN-001-101 Phase 1 , open label , non-randomized , dose escalation study 18 ( eighteen ) patient ( three six patient first three cohort , nine patient fourth cohort MTD ) . The fourth cohort ( MTD , earlier ) expand increment three patient total 18 patient enrol . Each patient provide write date informed consent prior undergoing eligibility screen entry study . Screening evaluation perform within 21 day prior schedule study drug administration . If eligibility criterion meet , patient enrol schedule placement IP catheter least 7 day prior schedule dosing ( Day -7 ) allow adequate time heal around catheter insertion site . Baseline evaluation perform prior dosing . At time investigator ensure patient remain eligible participation . All study drug administer inpatient basis patient remain confined 24 hour follow study drug administration evaluation safety collection specify body fluid sample plasmid IL-12-DNA cytokine determination . Each patient receive dose EGEN-001 weekly four week ( administer Day 0 , Day 7 , Day 14 , Day 21 ) . Patients undergo safety evaluation 1 , 4 24 hour 3 day follow dose . Patients return clinic safety evaluation three day , one week five week ( ± one week ) follow last dose .</detailed_description>
