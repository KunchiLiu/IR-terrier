	<brief_summary>This study patient resectable , locally advanced esophageal cancer . There evidence suggest celecoxib combination cisplatin irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) may work well radiation therapy kill cancer cell . The primary goal develop well-tolerated cancer treatment acceptable response rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin , CPT-11 Celecoxib With Radiation Therapy Surgery Operable Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients take celecoxib orally twice daily 3 day prior radiation therapy one week prior surgery . Celecoxib restart patient discharge hospital follow surgery continue 26 week . Patients receive chemotherapy ( cisplatin irinotecan ) weekly week 1 , 2 , 4 5 radiation therapy . Chemotherapy must occur fifth day radiation therapy . Radiation therapy perform 5 day week 5.6 week period . Patients undergo esophagectomy within 4-8 week chemotherapy/radiation therapy . Technically accessible lymph node also remove . During chemotherapy/radiation therapy , physical exam bloodwork conduct weekly . Between chemotherapy/radiation therapy surgery physical exam , bloodwork CT chest , abdomen , pelvis perform . After completion treatment surgery , physical exam bloodwork do every 6 week 6 month , every 3 month 1 1/2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
