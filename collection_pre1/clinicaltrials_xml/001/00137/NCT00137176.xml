	<brief_summary>The primary purpose determine change gene expression induce IFNb-1a ( Rebif ) atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) combination therapy patient isolated clinical syndrome suggestive multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , identify marker therapeutic response , predict patient ' clinical response base vitro response combination therapy measure gene expression level activate peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EARLY IFNb-1a Atorvastatin Combination Therapy Isolated Clinical Syndrome Suggestive Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) chronic neurologic disease , characterize pathologically focal area inflammation , demyelination , axonal injury degeneration central nervous system . MS follow several different disease course . Approximately , 90 % patient relapse form disease . We propose atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) may enhance immunomodulatory effect INFb-1a ( Rebif ) patient clinically isolated neurological syndrome suggestive MS . This combination may effective preventing development definitive relapsing-remitting MS administer early course disease . The study identify marker disease activity selectively affected combination therapy . Identified marker may use future clinical trial predict patient 's clinical response monitor response treatment secondary outcome measure .</detailed_description>
