	<detailed_description>Sodium valproate establish antiepileptic drug use broad range seizure type . Lamotrigine , new antiepileptic drug available since late 1980s , similar range action approve first-line treatment epilepsy United States many European country well Hong Kong . Recently , concern raise association valproate treatment polycystic ovarian syndrome , condition characterise multiple cyst ovary woman range hormonal metabolic disturbance . Cross-sectional study Finland suggest 40 % woman treat valproate polycystic ovary . Lamotrigine substitution valproate report normalise parameter patient . Elevated serum insulin androgen level also report 50 % male patient take valproate epilepsy . However , high incidence hormonal abnormality associate valproate treatment reproduce study conduct western population . No similar study Chinese patient report . In addition , cross-sectional study suffer many potential confounding factor , previous treatment antiepileptic drug , variation duration treatment , thus limit ability establish causal relationship . This phase IV study aim examine whether valproate treatment associate hormonal abnormality Chinese epilepsy patient . Newly diagnose patient randomise receive valproate lamotrigine hormonal profile measure prospectively 12 month .</detailed_description>
