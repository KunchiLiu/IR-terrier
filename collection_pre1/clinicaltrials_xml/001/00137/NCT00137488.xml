	<brief_summary>The low grade glioma ( LGG ) type brain tumor generally common young age group patient . Most patient LGG undergo surgery mostly incomplete due concern loss function . This incurable disease . More half patient progress high grade worse outcome within five year diagnosis one-third survive ten year . Post-operative radiation treatment improve local control without survival advantage . Efforts make without great success select patient high risk progression base physical characteristic histological feature . Tumor vascularity think key element tumor progression . Tremendous progress make functional imaging use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) 3-Tesla ( 3T ) biotechnology use investigate angiogenic gene profile order identify gene signature tumor . In study investigator propose patient LGG high risk tumor progression may select functional imaging angiogenic profile . These high risk patient may candidate post-operative radiation future potential survival benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Angiogenic Profile Non-invasive Imaging May Predict Tumor Progression High Risk Group Low Grade Glioma ( LGG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary : Comprehensive analysis angiogenesis-related gene expression profile tumor perfusion patient LGG provide novel understanding subgroup ( low high-risk ) LGG . Thus , study allow identify clinically relevant factor predictive tumor progression select patient high-risk group adjuvant radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
