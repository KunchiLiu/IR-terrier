	<brief_title>Measuring Hand Edema Burn Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective study involve 33 burn patient admit US Army Burn Center . Two raters perform three separate blind measurement hand edema use figure-of-eight measurement technique . A third rater perform two blind measurement use water volumetry . All measurement read record independent recorder . The three measurement rater 1 2 analyzed determine intratester reliability . The average three figure-of-eight measurement compare measure intertester reliability . The two volumetry measurement compare determine intratester reliability . The average 2 volumetry measurement average fo three figure-of-eight measurement use determine concurrent validity .</detailed_description>
