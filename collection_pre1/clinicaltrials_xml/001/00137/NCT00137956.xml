	<brief_title>Endobronchial Valve Emphysema PalliatioN Trial ( VENT ) Cost-effectiveness Sub-Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapeutic intervention health care require use resource . Since resource limit , important clinical decision-makers economic information addition safety efficacy data . In economic environment health care today , incremental cost new therapeutic intervention must offset value associate well outcomes improved health health-related quality life and/or low health care utilization cost time . Questions cost effectiveness medical care generate considerable attention medical outcome research . In 1993 , Department Health Human Services appoint multi-disciplinary group recommend standard evaluation health care . The panel 's report suggest standardized outcome analysis conduct evaluate cost-effectiveness medical care . These analysis require preference-weighted measure health-related quality life . Such measure need order adjust survival time health-related quality life .</detailed_description>
