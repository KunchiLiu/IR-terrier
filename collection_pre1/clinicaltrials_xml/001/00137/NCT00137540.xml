	<brief_summary>The objective multicenter randomize study establish effectiveness treatment paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , patient previously treat anti-arrhythmic drug , encircle pulmonary vein radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation , use NaviStar® ThermoCool® catheter CARTO™ EP Navigation System . Effectiveness determine compare chronic success ablation therapy versus anti-arrhythmic drug treatment , define patient absence atrial tachycardia 24 month follow-up determine 7-days Holter transtelephonic monitoring , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) recording .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FLAT Study : First Line Ablation Therapy Treatment Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation ( RAAFT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , randomize , multicenter clinical study enroll first phase 40 patient . The study perform 3 European hospital . Patients randomize either RF ablation strategy medication arm . Hypothesis : As first line therapy , catheter ablation improve long-term success , health-economic outcome equally safe compare best anti-arrhythmic medication treatment select group patient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . Primary endpoint : - long-term success , define patient free atrial fibrillation 24 month initial study treatment determine 7-days Holter transtelephonic monitoring 12-lead ECG recording . Secondary endpoint : - AF burden : frequency duration episodes - health-economic cost 24 month - serious adverse event - Quality Life score , use SF-36 questionnaire</detailed_description>
