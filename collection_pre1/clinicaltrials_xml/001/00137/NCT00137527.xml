	<brief_title>Brain Oxygenation Monitoring Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study represent prospective , randomized assessment potential clinical economic benefit derive continuous non-invasive monitoring regional cerebral oxygen saturation ( rSO2 ) cardiac surgery employ cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . Previous study show low rSO2 value obtain surgery highly associate postoperative frontal lobe dysfunction , cognitive decline , disorientation , clinical index prolong recovery . Low rSO2 value think reflect development tissue hypoxia within susceptible region cerebral cortex non-pulsatile perfusion CPB . Rapid detection correction episodes help avoid regional hypoxia attendant postoperative sequela . This study ass neurologic , psychometric , quality life marker brain dysfunction could result CPB . Each study patient assess pre- postoperatively ( pre-hospital discharge three month ) neurologic neurocognitive dysfunction . Comparison ( ) : Intervention versus control group . Patients assigned intervention rSO2-monitored group manage conservative measure design maintain rSO2 value , , preoperative value . Such measure include increase pump flow , blood pressure , anesthetic dose , arterial oxygen tension , carbon dioxide tension , hematocrit . Those patient control group manage accord current establish practice . Although rSO2 also record group , monitor 's reading blind .</detailed_description>
