	<brief_summary>The goal HOME Study quantify impact low-level fetal early childhood exposure environmental toxicant include lead , mercury , metal , pesticide , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , persistent organic pollutant ( PBDEs/PFCs ) , phthalates , phenol , environmental tobacco smoke , alcohol child development , neurobehavior , health , growth . The HOME Study also evaluate meconium biomarker fetal exposure test effectiveness home repair control lead hazard injury early childhood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim examine effect low-level exposure prevalent neurotoxicants health , growth , neurobehavior among representative sample child . Pregnant woman enrol project around 16 week gestation . In first phase study , follow child result pregnancy age 36 month . The second phase extend follow-up 72 month . Phase 3 extend follow-up 8 year ( range 7.5-10 ) comprehensive neurobehavioral assessment . Phase 4 allow follow-up 12 year ( range 11-13 ) , include measure health , growth body composition , behavior mental health , neuroimaging . To address potential adverse health risk environmental chemical , include persistent pollutant PBDEs PFCs non-persistent chemical , fetal , infant , child neurobehavior , investigator systematically examine association endocrine function , cognition , learn memory , motor skill , attention executive function , behavior age 1 7.5-10 year . The investigator also examine exposure different developmental stage ( utero 16 week gestation , early childhood , school age , preadolescence ) use store biological sample measure child neurobehavior 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 12 year . This longitudinal study allow investigator determine dose response , windows susceptibility , persistence association . The investigator also examine contribution PBDE exposures house dust subset child complete set sample maternal serum child serum collect annual visit along extensive measure mouth behavior . Hypotheses four phase study follow : 1 . In utero exposure measure survey ( alcohol ETS ) , maternal cord blood ( lead mercury ) maternal cord serum ( ETS ) , urine ( pesticide ) less predictive utero effect prevalent toxicant , include cognition , behavior problem , growth compare toxicant meconium . 2 . Prenatal postnatal exposure prevalent pesticide ETS associate adverse neurobehavioral effect , growth delay child . 3 . Higher lead exposure , measure pregnancy early childhood use maternal blood , cord blood , meconium child 's blood , associate low IQ score behavioral problem child maximal blood lead level &lt; 5 mg/dL . 4 . Children lead treatment arm : blood lead 2.7 mg/dL low , high IQ score , great growth velocity , few behavioral problem child control group . 5 . Levels lead dust , soil water significantly low housing unit lead treatment arm compare injury control arm 36 48 month home visit . 6 . A multifactorial , housing intervention reduce residential injury 30 percent among child injury treatment arm compare lead treatment arm . 7 . Prenatal Postnatal exposure PBDEs PFCs associate altered thyroid hormone level deficit infant child neurobehavior 8 . With increase child age , PBDE exposure household dust becomes strong predictor child serum PBDE concentration exposure placenta breast milk . 9 . Developmental PBDE PFC exposures associate internalize symptom . 10 . Developmental PBDE PFC exposures associate adverse change anatomical structure , neurochemistry , organization white matter tract , connectivity neural network . 11 . PFAS affect gene expression function several biological pathway program fetus/infant towards 'thrifty phenotype ' . This lead accelerate early childhood growth , increase fat mass , feature metabolic syndrome .</detailed_description>
