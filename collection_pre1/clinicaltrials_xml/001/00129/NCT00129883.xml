	<detailed_description>Improving process care patient hospital LRTI relate well patient outcome . Inappropriate use antibiotic contribute emergence spread drug-resistant micro organism increase treatment cost . International guideline provide recommendation initial evaluation management LRTI , include advice judicious antibiotic therapy . Nonetheless , study demonstrate wide variability adherence guideline . To implement key recommendation clinical practice , various strategy use , mixed result . Perhaps important aspect choose potentially effective intervention choice intervention base upon assessment potential barrier target group . Many intervention study flaw fail control secular trend . The investigator perform cluster randomise control trial , study effect multifaceted intervention strategy quality antibiotic use LRTI . Their intervention tailor area need improvement take perceived barrier target group consideration individual hospital level .</detailed_description>
