	<brief_summary>Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody ( a.k.a . hOKT3gamma1 [ Ala-Ala ] , teplizumab , MGA031 ) humanize antibody commonly use prevent organ rejection . The purpose study determine whether anti-CD3 mAb treatment halt progression newly diagnose type 1 diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autoimmunity-blocking Antibody Tolerance Recently Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes autoimmune disease immune system mistakenly attack insulin-producing beta cell pancreas . Without cell , body maintain proper blood glucose level response daily activity , eat exercise . Generally , time type 1 diabetes diagnosis , 60 % 85 % diabetic person 's beta cell already destroy . However , 15 % 40 % cell remain able produce insulin . Treatment slow destruction additional beta cell may able decrease patient 's reliance insulin improve quality life . Anti-CD3 mAb genetically engineer direct CD3 antigen T cell ; antibody selectively attack immune cell responsible beta cell destruction . In small exploratory clinical trial , patient newly diagnose type 1 diabetes receive single , 2-week treatment anti-CD3 mAb preserve beta cell function significantly low insulin requirement untreated patient two year therapy . This study investigate whether second course anti-CD3 mAb administer one year first administration able prolong improve effect biologic people recently diagnose type 1 diabetes mellitus . Participants randomly assign one two group . The Experimental Group receive anti-CD3 mAb treatment plus Diabetes Standard Care Treatment ; Active Comparator Group receive Diabetes Standard Care Treatment . The Experimental Group treat antibody first 14 day study one year later . These participant admit hospital first 5 day treatment cycle . Participants live within 1 hour hospital may receive remainder treatment cycle outpatient , live far away hospitalized 14 day . For first treatment cycle , study visit 3 consecutive day treatment cycle Months 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 . For second treatment cycle , study visit 3 consecutive day treatment cycle Months 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , 24.The Active Comparator Group 12 study visit two year . At study entry , participant receive daily iron supplementation , either ferrous sulfate multivitamin iron . Participants follow 2 year assess overall diabetes health capture laboratory measure beta cell immune system function . Medication history adverse event assessment occur visit . A physical exam , vital sign measurement , blood collection occur visit . Medical history urine collection occur select visit .</detailed_description>
