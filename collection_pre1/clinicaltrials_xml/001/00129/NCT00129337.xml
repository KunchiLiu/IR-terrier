	<brief_title>Study Bavituximab Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The genetic variation observe advanced cancer decrease effectiveness many anti-cancer agent development drug resistance . Therefore , alternative approach direct target cancer cell urgently need . Bavituximab generic name chimeric ( human/murine ) monoclonal antibody direct aminophospholipids . Bavituximab Peregrine 's first investigational product anti-phospholipid therapy technology platform . Anti-phospholipid therapy novel approach treat cancer . It base find aminophospholipids , basic component inner surface cell become externally exposed response certain disease state cancer . Laboratory animal study demonstrate bavituximab specifically target cancer cell inhibit tumor growth variety experimental cancer model . This study examine safety tolerability bavituximab administer patient advance solid tumor cancer unresponsive current therapy . Cohorts 6 patient treat start dose 0.1 mg bavituximab per kilogram body weight ( 0.1 mg/kg ) . Successive patient cohort receive 0.3 , 1.0 3.0 mg/kg bavituximab . Patients follow total 56 day . Patients demonstrate objective tumor response offer bavituximab treatment extension protocol .</detailed_description>
