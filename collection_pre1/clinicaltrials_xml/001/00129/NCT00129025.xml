	<brief_summary>Many patient localized prostate cancer choose radiotherapy treatment . Recent improvement technology lead good outcomes less side effect well disease control rate allow high dos radiation deliver cancer lower dose surround healthy tissue . Currently patient require attend daily treatment seven eight week costly disruptive patient , especially live close cancer centre . There recent research suggest good outcome might achieve prostate cancer deliver small number treatment , high dose radiation give visit , short time usual seven eight week . In study investigator propose treat patient prostate cancer use 16 treatment four week , thus reduce number visit cancer centre treatment 50 % .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Radiotherapy ( 55 Gy/16 Fractions/4 Weeks ) Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : - To determine acute late effect high-dose short-course hypofractionated radiotherapy 55 Gy/16 fraction/4 week treatment localized prostate cancer . - To provide clinical data confirmation current linear-quadratic radiobiological model fractionation sensitivity treatment prostate cancer external beam radiotherapy . Radiotherapy Prostate Cancer : In 2003 , 18,800 Canadians expect diagnosed prostate cancer , 2000 Alberta . Prostate cancer represent significant workload Canadian cancer centre . At Cross Cancer Institute ( CCI ) , approximately 400 patient underwent radical course external beam radiotherapy 2002 . Typically , course radiation consist 35 fraction give 7 week . Assuming ideal efficiency patient turnover give linear accelerator , 3000 machine hour would require treat 400 patient . At present , clinical trial on-going confirm increase radiation dose give 39-44 fraction per patient efficacious current standard 35-39 fraction . Such increase radiation dose require increase treatment capacity 10 % without increase number patient treated . As alternative increase number fraction deliver great total dose , radiation dose give fraction increase . Accordingly total dose decrease maintain acceptable toxicity . Such treatment schedule refer `` hypofractionation '' . Hypofractionation prostate cancer study Phase III NCIC Clinical Trials Group PR-5 study . The long term outcomes report ASTRO November 2003 . The result PR-5 study , together similar Australian randomize trial report 2003 , strongly support biological model high fractionation sensitivity prostate cancer , exploit use hypofractionated radiotherapy . Hypofractionation - Choice Dose-Fractionation Treatment Planning : Hypofractionated radiotherapy schedule design base premise biological equivalent dose , model linear quadratic method . Possible schedule achieve equivalent result give 10 30 fraction . In 2002 2003 , investigator Toronto , Ontario Cleveland , Ohio report promising preliminary result base 20 28 fraction per treatment course . This technique take advantage modern CT-based treatment plan system technology precisely target prostate maximal spar adjacent normal tissue . In 2003 , investigator TBCC conduct dosimetry study determine equivalent hypofractionated dose give 16 fraction . The result , present principal investigator European Cancer Conference September 2003 Canadian Association Radiation Oncologists scientific meeting October 2003 , show dose 55 Gy 16 fraction give four week biologically equivalent course treatment compare current standard treatment seven eight week CCI . The hypothesis test study hypofractionated radiotherapy 55 Gy/16 fractions/4 week well tolerate acute late toxicity comparable conventional radiotherapy . The secondary objective determine rate biochemical control need complex treatment planning ( IMRT ) oppose 3D conformal therapy . Patient Population : Patients low intermediate risk prostate cancer eligible study . Specifically , patient clinical T1 T2 , Gleason score 6 PSA &lt; 20 patient clinical T1-T2 , Gleason score 7 PS &lt; 15 eligible . Treatment : Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy six month allow . Radiation dose prescribed 55 Gy 16 fraction four week , four fraction per week . CTV prostate +/- 0.5-1 cm seminal vesicle . PTV CTV plus 10 mm margin direction except posterior ( 5 mm ) . To ensure precise target use daily on-line imaging correction position prior treatment , fiducial marker insert prostate transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) guidance . Three inert gold marker ( 0.98 mm diameter x 5 mm length ) implant prostate apex , mid-gland base . The procedure follow similar guideline TRUS prostate biopsy . Treatment plan guideline provide 3D planning well IMRT . All patient plan 3D conformal technique dosimetry unsatisfactory , IMRT use . Failure meet dose-constraint criterion normal tissue exclude patient trial . Details treatment planning provide full study protocol . Radiation Delivery : With use fiducial marker , isocentre placement ( ie : targeting ) correction make maintain target error great 3 mm right-left superior-inferior direction , great 2 mm anterior-posterior direction . All deviation record . Treatment Outcomes : Other outcome include acute late GU/bladder acute GI/rectum toxicity well patient-assessed quality life ( Prostate Cancer Index ) . The percentage patient require IMRT treatment determine . The change rectal mucosa assess endoscopy subset patient agree undergo sigmoidoscopy baseline , 18 month 36 month radiotherapy . Tumor control determine PSA relapse free survival , use ASTRO consensus definition PSA failure . Statistics Safety Monitoring : The sample six one convenience . Given limitation impose time require treatment plan complete trial , investigator estimate one patient/month accrue treat three centre . They anticipate 72 patient enrolled trial two year period . This allow estimation late toxicity rate reasonable precision . Approximate confidence interval ( CI ) width assume minimal sample size ( 72 ) , base exact binomial interval : Gr 3 , 4 toxicity rate 0.05 : 0.1 : 0.15 : 0.2 ; 95 % CI width 0.12 : 0.16 : 0.18 : 0.20 . Given potential increase toxicity due large dose/fraction , investigator implement early stopping rule unacceptable acute toxicity . Although late toxicity endpoint interest , acute toxicity use proxy due length time need determine late toxicity . Acute GI GU toxicity report significant predictor late toxicity several investigator . The stopping rule determine follow method Thall , Simon Estey ( JCO 1996 ) ( 20 ) . The investigator assume apriori distribution toxicity rate describe Betal ( 1.3 , 20 ) ie : mean toxicity rate = 0.05 , 95 % probability interval toxicity rate 0.00 d0.10 . The trial would stop posterior distribution : Pr ( toxicity rate &gt; 0.10/data ) &gt; =0.80 - , likely toxicity rate &gt; 10 % . Data Coordination : This study conduct three cancer centre , namely Tom Baker Cancer Centre , Calgary ; Cross Cancer Institute , Edmonton ; Saskatoon Cancer Centre , Saskatoon . All patient relate data collect individual institution forward TBCC , coordinate centre . Grade 3 4 toxicity serious adverse event monitor discuss among co-investigators . Data entry analysis perform TBCC statistical support Division Population Health Information centre .</detailed_description>
