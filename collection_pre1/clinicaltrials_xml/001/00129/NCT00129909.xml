	<detailed_description>There clear need improve approach improve blood pressure control improve compliance medication regimen . Although decreasing frequency drug take improve blood pressure control , whether fixed-dose combination effective take multiple tablet unknown . Additionally , notwithstanding presence excellent evidence-based recommendation treatment hypertension , choices practitioner regard first line therapy widening ( may confuse , especially set proliferation recommendation range disease ) . Whether simplify treatment algorithm , consistent Canadian Hypertension Education Program ( CHEP ) guideline use step-care approach , might improve management hypertension unknown . The current study determine effectiveness simplify treatment algorithm incorporate early use fixed-dose combination therapy . This cluster randomize control trial . Approximately 50 family practice eligible study participation randomize 1:1 ratio implement treatment algorithm continue usual care management hypertension . The randomization schedule stratify year graduation family physician ( &lt; 1984 ≥ 1984 ) . Within practice , 50 subject manage accord algorithm usual care follow six month .</detailed_description>
