	<brief_summary>Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) disease often surgically operate . As result , treat tumor radiation become main standard treatment . Radiation therapy though , limited various factor , include difficulty properly image lung tumor since lung move 4 cm breathing . Consequently , radiation oncologist must consider large area lung treat radiation - increase amount normal tissue expose harmful ray therefore lead increase side-effects . Two technique explore improve tumor management minimize side effect NSCLC breath-held gate tomotherapy . Breath-held gating technique consistently image tumor right moment patient 's breathing cycle - decrease normal tissue expose harmful radiation . Tomotherapy , new technique deliver radiation , allow investigator focus treatment tumor exclude normal tissue . Therefore , hope method prove good way treat people NSCLC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) disease often present unresectable tumor . As result , radiotherapy main standard treatment . Unfortunately , radiotherapy limit several factor , include lung move 4 cm inspiration expiration . As result , radiation oncologist often widen treatment field include motion . This lead great side effect patient . Two technique explore improve tumor control radiotherapy minimize side effect normal tissue NSCLC treatment include breath-held gating tomotherapy . Breath-held gate allow investigator treat patient right moment breathe cycle consistently - minimize normal tissue expose radiation . In addition , gate breathe tomotherapy allow investigator create refined tumor volume treat exclude normal tissue . Consequently , hope method prove good way treat patient non-resectable NSCLC .</detailed_description>
