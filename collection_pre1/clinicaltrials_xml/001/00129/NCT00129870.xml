	<brief_summary>The primary rationale study develop optimize schedule administration FOLFOX + bevacizumab maximize efficacy safety regimen administer patient advanced colorectal cancer . The hypothesis use intermittent oxaliplatin ( IO ) schedule FOLFOX/bevacizumab allow patient continue treatment long period time reduce proportion patient discontinue therapy early treatment-related toxicity thus increase possibility long time progression . The primary objective : - To test hypothesis intermittent oxaliplatin ( IO ) schedule FOLFOX/bevacizumab allow patient remain therapy long period time compare conventional `` treat-to-failure '' schedule , reduce proportion patient discontinue therapy treatment-related toxicity . The secondary objective : - To evaluate impact calcium/magnesium infusion incidence severity neurotoxicity subject receive either IO conventional FOLFOX/bevacizumab treatment schedule first-line treatment metastatic colorectal cancer . - To evaluate safety efficacy IO versus conventional schedule + calcium magnesium infusion , part oxaliplatin-based first-line therapy metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
