	<brief_title>Phase II Nilotinib With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ( CML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nilotinib drug design block protein responsible development CML . If find eligible take part study , take 2-4 nilotinib capsule tablet mouth 2 time day ( 4-8 capsule tablet day total ) every day , least 8 hour apart . Nilotinib take morning even large glass water . The study medication give every 3 - 12 month . You also give `` pill diary '' write ( day time ) take drug . You also write diary side effect may experience . You bring diary , unused capsule tablet , empty container nilotinib every visit study doctor . Any unused supply must return end study . Every 1-4 week first 4 week study , around 2 teaspoon blood drawn routine blood test . The blood test repeat every 4-8 week ( often doctor feel necessary ) study 6 month , every 3 6 month another 18 month . After , may blood test repeat often doctor think need . A bone marrow sample also take every 3-4 month first year every 6-12 month 2nd year , every 2-3 year long study check status disease . Additionally , blood ( ½ tablespoon ) drawn bone marrow sample collect every 3-4 month first year every 6-12 month 2 year , one time year long study check status disease . However , complete remission Year 2 , doctor decide bone marrow aspiration . But still blood drawn ( ½ tablespoon ) every 1 - 3 year check status disease . An ECG repeat around Day 5 , 6 week 3 month . You ask visit doctor physical exam vital sign measure periodically . These visit schedule least every 3 4 month first year . After first year , study staff recommend physical exam every year . The visit may schedule often depend status disease . Treatment may continue 8-10 year long doctor feel necessary control leukemia . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . This investigational study . Nilotinib FDA approve . A total 150 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis Phpositive Bcrpositive CML early chronic phase CML ( i.e. , time diagnosis 12 month ) . Except hydroxyurea , patient must receive minimal prior therapy , define &lt; 1 month ( 30 day ) prior interferonalpha ( without cytarabine ) and/or FDAapproved TKI . Patients de novo accelerated phase treat analyzed separately . 2 . Age &gt; /= 16 year ( Age &gt; 18 year participate optional symptom burden assessment ) 3 . ECOG performance 02 . 4 . Adequate end organ function , define follow : total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN , SGPT &lt; 2.5 x ULN , creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN . 5 . Patients must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study , keep policy hospital . 6 . Reliable telephone access receive call interactive voice response system ( IVR ) ( applicable patient participate optional symptom burden assessment ) . 1 . NYHA cardiac class 34 heart disease well impaired cardiac function define : LVEF &lt; 45 % determine MUGA scan electrocardiogram ; Complete leave bundle branch block ; Use cardiac pacemaker ; ST depression &gt; 1 mm 2 lead and/or T wave inversion 2 continuous lead ; Congenital long QT syndrome ; History , presence significant ventricular atrial tachyarrhythmia 's ; Clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 bpm ) ; QTc &gt; 450 msec screen ECG ( use QTcF formula ) ; 2 . ( Continued # 1 ) Right bundle branch block plus leave anterior hemiblock , bivascular block ; Myocardial infarction within 12 month prior start AMN107 ; Unstable angina diagnose treat within past 12 month ; Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) . 3 . Patients active , uncontrolled psychiatric disorder include : psychosis , major depression , bipolar disorder . 4 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day initiation study drug dosing . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Surgical sterilization consider nonchildbearing potential . Female patient reproductive potential must agree employ effective method birth control ( hormonal barrier ) throughout study 3 month follow discontinuation study drug . 5 . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medial disease ( i.e. , uncontrolled diabetes , chronic renal disease , active uncontrolled infection [ persistent fever worsen clinical condition ] ) . 6 . Patient know chronic liver disease ( i.e. , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis ) . 7 . Patient known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . 8 . Patients late chronic phase ( i.e. , time diagnosis treatment &gt; 12 month ) blastic phase exclude . The definition CML phase follow : A . Early chronic phase : time diagnosis therapy &lt; 12 month Late chronic phase : time diagnosis therapy &gt; 12 months.B . Blastic phase : presence 30 % blast peripheral blood bone marrow . C. Accelerated phase CML : presence follow feature : * Peripheral marrow blast 15 % . 9 . ( Cont . # 8 ) Peripheral marrow basophils 20 % . *Thrombocytopenia &lt; 100 x 10 ( 9 ) /L unrelated therapy . * Documented extramedullary blastic disease outside liver spleen due past cause D. Clonal evolution define presence additional chromosomal abnormality Ph chromosome part accelerate phase CML . Ph chromosome variant complex Ph chromosome translocation consider indicate disease acceleration . 10 . ( Cont # 8 ) We recently find clonal evolution variable prognostic impact may suppress IFNa therapy . Hence patient , like others de novo accelerated phase , eligible , analyzed separately .</criteria>
