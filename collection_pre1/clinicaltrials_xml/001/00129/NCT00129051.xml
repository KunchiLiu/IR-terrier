	<brief_summary>Radiation treatment often use treat cancer spread abdomen . It effective relieve symptom pain , radiotherapy cause side-effects cramp diarrhea . This study investigate whether possible reduce unwanted side-effects radiotherapy new technology call `` helical tomotherapy '' . Tomotherapy new way deliver radiation much accurate fashion currently do , less radiation deliver normal tissue around tumor . This study involve treatment 20 patient , spread cancer within abdomen pelvis , use helical tomotherapy . The dose energy radiation currently use - delivery system different . The purpose assure tomotherapy safe way deliver radiation treatment investigate whether reduce toxicity radiation treatment patient . Patients treat group three 20 treat . The toxicity treatment measure questionnaire one . If unexpected severe treatment complication occur , accrual stop .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Helical Tomotherapy Radiotherapy Technique Treating Pelvic Abdominal Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy effective treatment treat metastatic disease . When used treat disease low abdomen pelvis , however , frequently associate gastrointestinal toxicity . The common symptom radiation enteritis diarrhea , bloating , abdominal cramping . They cause irritation inflammation bowel mucosa , although pathophysiology poorly understood , think due part malabsorption bile salt lactose , imbalance bacterial flora , disturbance motility . The true incidence clinically significant enteritis well know probably underestimated , majority patient symptom seek medical advice , approximately 80 % patient receive pelvic radiotherapy gynecologic rectal tumor . Different approach take try minimize acute small large bowel toxicity radiotherapy . Medical management opioid derivative , loperamide , often effective mild case . Other medication , try inhibit biochemical pathway lead symptomatic gastroenteritis , undergone clinical test success . The approach minimize toxicity minimize volume and/or dose radiation deliver small bowel . Simple mechanical device , `` belly board '' mesh sling , success . With new technique intensity-modulated radiotherapy , may possible avoid much bowel , significantly reduce dose deliver bowel , without mechanical intervention compromise tumour dos . The aim trial test whether new highly sophisticated form intensity modulate radiotherapy call helical tomotherapy safely use deliver radiotherapy abdomen pelvis . It also establish whether treatment modality allow reduction radiation dose normal structure incidence radiation-induced bowel injury . Helical tomotherapy new form radiation treatment delivery introduce Cross Cancer Institute late 2001 early 2002 . Unlike standard radiotherapy , treatment deliver one separate beam , helical tomotherapy delivers treatment rotate , intensity-modulated fan beam . The patient translate ring gantry beam rotate around , treatment beam form helical shape similar manner compute tomography ( CT ) scan . The ring gantry provide stable platform perform tomographic verification setup deliver dose . Helical tomotherapy similar NOMOS PeacockTM system currently clinical use . The PeacockTM system also use intensity-modulated fan beam , attachment standard C-arm linear accelerator , delivers treatment `` translate rotate '' method rather continuous spiral delivery . Because complete freedom helical tomotherapy deliver treatment angle around patient intensity modulation inverse treatment planning , possible treat highly complex irregular target volume give low radiation dose surround normal structure . This study , along parallel study involve treatment bone metastasis , involve first patient treated helical tomotherapy Cross Cancer Institute . It important first step understanding process capability helical tomotherapy deliver accurate image-guided therapy . It design provide framework next generation clinical trial use helical tomotherapy adjuvant radical setting . The objective study follow : - To assess whether feasible deliver daily fractionate radiotherapy helical tomotherapy ; - To assess acute toxicity associate treatment pelvic abdominal metastasis helical tomotherapy ; - To test accuracy daily setup verification process inherent helical tomotherapy system ; - To perform vivo dosimetry , possible ; - To analyze dose distribution possible helical tomotherapy planning , compare plan obtain use conventional linear accelerator system . To accomplish objective , investigator recruit 20 patient treatment helical tomotherapy . Patients solid malignancy primary site proven suspect metastatic disease involve abdomen , pelvis , bone lumbar spine pelvis eligible , provide 18 year age ; sign informed consent obtain ; contraindication radiotherapy . The investigator select patient enrollment high likelihood ( &gt; 50 % ) suffering grade 2 high acute GI toxicity standard radiotherapy technique use . Treatment deliver helical tomotherapy system , dose plan design treat target volume homogeneous dose , minimize dose normal structure include small bowel . The first 10 patient treat dose 2500 cGy 10 fraction , second cohort 10 patient 3000 cGy 10 fraction . The slightly low normal dose use first cohort design provide extra margin safety . Statistical Considerations : With dos radiation use current study , risk grade 4-5 toxicity use standard treatment technique low . The investigator , therefore , use observe grade 4-5 acute toxicity early stop rule monitor safety helical tomotherapy . Patients accrue onto treatment sequentially , 3 patient treatment within 1 week complete treatment time . If patient develops grade 4 toxicity shortly treatment , accrual suspend time cause severe treatment toxicity establish , determine treatment subsequent patient proceed safely . If second severe toxicity observe trial close accrual . For purpose study risk grade 4-5 radiation enteritis ( use standard radiotherapy technique ) assume 2 % less . Thus probability stop accrual trial completion 0.16 reduction toxicity rate helical tomotherapy ( accord binomial probability ) . If true rate 1 % probability reject treatment 0.01 . The acute side effect treatment monitor use patient symptom questionnaire physician assessment history physical examination . These perform pre-treatment , weekly treatment , 1 4 week post treatment . A secondary endpoint study test setup verification process helical tomotherapy system . It design automatically detect whether patient set accurately treatment , adjust treatment day-to-day change patient position . For first 10 patient , investigator compare tomotherapy-derived setup error error manually compute study CT image set . If computer derive setup error accurate compare manual evaluation ( within 5 mm least 80 % measurement ) , automate setup verification process utilized second cohort 10 patient . It estimate study take 3-6 month complete .</detailed_description>
