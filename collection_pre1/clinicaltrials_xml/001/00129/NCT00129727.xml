	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer diagnose approximately 26,000 American woman year , lead cause death gynecologic cancer . Difficult detect , disease typically present advanced . Ovarian cancer among sensitive solid tumor chemotherapy . However , majority patient ovarian cancer achieve complete remission first line platinum-based chemotherapy ultimately develop recurrent disease . The combination carboplatin paclitaxel standard first line combination US . In patient advanced ovarian cancer , carboplatin plus paclitaxel result less toxicity , easy administer , inferior , compare cisplatin plus paclitaxel . The randomized trial , GOG-158 finally confirm adoption standard improve toxicity profile combination cisplatin paclitaxel , doublet previously demonstrate substantially good progression free overall survival advantage compare cisplatin cyclophosphamide advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer . Although nonrandomized trial , carboplatin paclitaxel less toxic highly active combination regimen , remain concern regard efficacy patient good prognosis completely resect advanced disease . In parallel European , multicentre , randomised trial , January , 1996 , March , 2002 , 802 patient platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer relapse 6 month treatment-free enrol 119 hospital five country ( ICON III ) . Patients randomly assign paclitaxel plus platinum chemotherapy conventional platinum-based chemotherapy . Survival curve demonstrate difference favor paclitaxel plus platinum ( hazard ratio 0.82 [ 95 % CI 0.69-0.97 ] , p=0.02 ) , correspond absolute difference 2-year survival 7 % paclitaxel conventional treatment group ( 57 vs 50 % [ 95 % CI difference 1-12 ] ) , median survival 5 month ( 29 vs 24 month [ 1-11 ] ) . Since hypothesis target angiogenesis treat cancer first describe 1971 Judah Folkman , intense research development antiangiogenic cancer therapy . Tumors dependent development vascular supply . Recent work show , cell already transform , angiogenesis initiate tumor mass comprise 100-300 cell . VEGF action mediate bind two receptor tyrosine kinase , VEGF-R-1 ( Flt-1 ) VEGF-R- 2 ( KDR ; whose murine form know Flk-1 ) . Activation receptor VEGF trigger phosphorylation multitude protein active signal transduction cascade . VEGF gene expression upregulated wide range stimulus include hypoxia , nitric oxide , estrogen , variety growth factor ( e.g. , FGF-4 , PDGF , TNF , TGF-b , EGF , IL-6 , IL-1b , # 76 ) common genetic event associate malignant phenotype ( loss tumor suppressor gene p53 activation oncogene ra , v-src HER2/neu ) . Beside major angiogenic property , VEGF potent mitogen vascular endothelium , inhibit endothelial apoptosis mobilize bone marrow-derived endothelial cell precursor . VEGF also mediate secretion enzyme involve degradation extracellular matrix , modulate migration , increase vascular permeability , upregulates hexose transport induces monocyte migration . Ovarian cancer secrete large amount VEGF vitro vivo , VEGF appear play crucial role angiogenesis tumor induce immunosuppression ovarian cancer patient . Indeed , VEGF confirm independent prognostic indicator multivariate analysis survival . Angiogenesis crucial development ovarian cancer . VEGF closely link normal ovarian function require development corpus luteum maturation endometrium . Elevated VEGF expression occur stage ovarian cancer associate poor prognosis . In fact , VEGF level appear prognostically important . In addition role ovarian-cancer-associated angiogenesis , VEGF overexpression directly associate production ascitic fluid , feature probably related ability induce endothelial hyperpermeability . In study monitor VEGF tumor resection , VEGF appear valid tumor marker , follow dramatic decline surgery , level rise recurrence . The parent murine antibody bevacizumab , A.4.6.1 , demonstrate promising antitumor activity subcutaneous SKOV-3 human ovarian cancer xenograft model . Interestingly , intraperitoneal model cell line , A.4.6.1 produce partial inhibition tumor growth , associate almost complete inhibition ascites production . These data provide rationale evaluation bevacizumab ovarian cancer . A Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) phase II study bevacizumab monotherapy ongoing , second trial examine combination bevacizumab daily , low-dose , oral cyclophosphamide , use metronomic dose hope 'less ' . Bevacizumab ( rHumAb VEGF ; Genentech , Inc. , CA ) , recombinant humanize monoclonal antibody direct VEGF , neutralizes biological property human VEGF . Bevacizumab , derive murine antibody A.4.6.1 , comprise 93 % human IgG frameworks 7 % murine-derived antigen-binding region , humanization provide long half-life less immunogenicity . Based preclinical data , phase I/II program bevacizumab initiate . The initial phase I trial enrol 25 patient dose-escalation fashion ( 0.1-10.0 mg/kg day 0 , 28 , 35 , 42 ) . No grade 3 4 toxicity see directly attributable therapy . There three episode tumor-related bleeding , include hemorrhage previously undetected cerebral metastasis . Grade 1 2 toxicity , possibly probably related treatment , include asthenia , headache , nausea . There complete partial response see , although one patient renal cell carcinoma achieve mixed response . The material use study NOT commercially available Avastinâ„¢ ( Genentech , Inc. ; South San Francisco , CA ) , may differ product . Bevacizumab demonstrate preclinical clinical activity colorectal cancer Genentech choose disease registration study . At ASCO 2003 Hurwitz et al report result phase III study standard bolus irinotecan/5-FU/LV ( IFL ) plus bevacizumab ( 5 mg/kg ) . An impressive median survival advantage ( 20.3 month vs. 15.6 month [ p=0.00003 ] ) report 925 patient receive first line therapy irinotecan , 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin treatment metastatic colorectal cancer . Only grade 3 hypertension ( 11 % ) , easily manage oral medication , clearly increase Phase III study . Gastrointestinal perforation , although rare , possibly see frequently . Importantly , first phase III validation antiangiogenic approach treatment human cancer . Several , large phase III trial bevacizumab metastatic colorectal cancer way . These include first-line study standard 5-FU/LV without bevacizumab patient appropriate irinotecan therapy . A phase III study ass FOLFOX regimen without bevacizumab second-line set patient fail previous irinotecan plus 5-FU treatment . These result help define benefit anti-VEGF therapy . Other study await , notably ECOG 4599 randomize comparison Taxol carboplatin without bevacizumab , patient non-small cell lung cancer complete accrual 600 patient . There three reason investigate protract exposure bevacizumab . Firstly , agent , induce apoptosis , consider cytotoxic protract exposure think necessary maintain tumor dormancy . Secondly , study colorectal cancer treat patient tumor progression . Lastly , evolve paradigm treatment ovarian cancer . It widely accept continual rather intermittent palliative chemotherapy translates well quality life . The Gynecologic Oncology Group recently report provocative randomized control trial confirmed significant large improvement progression free survival ( GOG 178 ) , consider important end point patient advanced ovarian cancer . Furthermore , preclinical study ovarian cancer , ovarian cancer model present compelling argument prolong bevacizumab administration . Having inoculate human ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV-3 within peritoneal cavity immunodeficient mouse , tumor engraft 7 10 day . The function-blocking VEGF antibody , A4.6.1 significantly inhibit subcutaneous SKOV-3 tumor growth approximately 20 fold compare control ( P &lt; 0.05 ) , similarly intraperitoneal model . Importantly , within 2 3 week cessation A4.6.1 treatment , effectively treat mouse develop severe ascites , become cachectic , kill , subsequent tumor burden animal vary moderate high . It clarify murine study utilize A4.6.1 murine precursor bevacizumab , result extrapolate action bevacizumab . OVERVIEW OF TRIAL DESIGN Study Design : Open label phase II study . Subjects : Patients chemotherapy naive epithelial ovarian cancer ; fallopian , primary peritoneal papillary serous mullerian tumor . CHEMOTHERAPY Carboplatin paclitaxel administer concurrently bevacizumab surgery 6-8 cycle q21 day . Bevacizumab omit first cycle , immediately post-operatively continue one year consolidation therapy .</detailed_description>
