	<detailed_description>Background : Emphysema , cause primarily smoke , characterize gradual , irreversible breakdown tissue loss elastic recoil within lung , cause lose ability expel air efficiently absorb oxygen . As chronic condition inexorably progress , diseased , hyperinflated area lung eventually fill chest cavity , leave less less volume available viable lung tissue . Lung volume reduction surgery ( LVRS ) show offer relief patient suffer emphysema treatment option fail . Researchers continue refine technique patient selection order improve outcome . The objective lung volume reduction eliminate dysfunctional , over-inflated region lung . Results similar surgical removal obtain plication ( fold ) staple without tissue removal . These result suggest isolation dysfunctional lung region achieve similar result tissue removal . The paradoxical effect improve lung function removing ( isolate ) lung tissue demonstrate breathlessness due emphysema function mechanical inefficiency addition loss gas-transfer surface area physiological mechanism . At least patient , mechanical compromise primary cause pulmonary incapacitation patient benefit address inability effectively inhale exhale . Because LVRS reduces trap gas , others speculate result similar LVRS could achieve bronchoscopically reduce volume hyperinflated region , without , atelectasis . Emphasys develop bronchoscopic approach block inspiratory airflow target , hyperinflated region lung , permit exhale gas escape . This approach may lead lung volume reduction provide clinical benefit LVRS without high risk cost associate invasive surgical procedure . Comparison : The primary object study ass safety efficacy Emphasys Endobronchial Valve ( EBV ) procedure ( pulmonary rehabilitation ) compare medical management ( pulmonary rehabilitation ) patient heterogeneous emphysema .</detailed_description>
