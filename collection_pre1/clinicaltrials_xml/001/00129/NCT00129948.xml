	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , single-arm , open-label , multi-center study establish safety efficacy Troxatyl™ ( troxacitabine ) administer continuous infusion 5 day subject AML . The study primarily assess complete response ( CR ) rate 5-day continuous infusion troxacitabine 12 mg/m2/day give second salvage therapy adult patient AML , secondary objective determine overall , relapse-free event-free survival remission duration ; determine duration response ; determine complete response incomplete platelet recovery ( CRp ) rate ; evaluate tolerability safety 5-day continuous intravenous ( IV ) infusion troxacitabine ; determine relationship troxacitabine plasma concentration , anti-leukemic activity adverse event . Additional cycle treatment may give investigator ’ discretion , provide subject progressive disease experience dose limit toxicity . Bone marrow transplantation respond subject allow .</detailed_description>
