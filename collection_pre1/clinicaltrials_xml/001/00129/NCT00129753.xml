	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To determine safety efficacy Campath-1H ( Alemtuzumab ) patient relapse resistant classical Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine duration response time progression Campath-1H therapy patient population . 2 .

	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab ( Campath-1H ) Monoclonal Antibody Patients With Relapsed Resistant Classical Hodgkin 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alemtuzumab type drug know `` monoclonal antibody '' . The antibody bind specific protein ( antigen ) call CD52 . CD52 find surface normal lymphocytes monocyte . When antibody bind protein surface lymphocyte monocyte cause cell die . The goal study learn kill normal lymphocyte monocyte alemtuzumab result regression ( lessen ) cancer cell . Alemtuzumab usually give infusion vein . However , study , give injection under-the-skin . This method give alemtuzumab approve FDA . The purpose give drug injection skin decrease side effect observe infusion vein . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) collect routine test . A bone marrow sample collect learn Hodgkin 's lymphoma spread bone marrow . To collect bone marrow sample ( biopsy ) , area hip bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . A CT scan MRI chest , abdomen ( stomach ) , pelvis ( waist area ) do . You also PET scan Gallium scan check status disease . You required heart scan echocardiogram check strong heart muscle . You ask medication currently take , include over-the-counter medication . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , receive alemtuzumab 3 time week injection skin . Typically injection give Monday , Wednesday , Friday . Each dose divide two injection give thigh . You treat 12 week row . The treatment dose give nurse M. D. Anderson outpatient setting . Before injection , may receive Tylenol and/or Benadryl decrease risk side effect cause study drug . During 12-week treatment course , addition study drug injection , visit clinic every 3 week physical exam routine blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) . You also blood test ( 1 tablespoonful ) every week find certain type viral infection ( cytomegalovirus , call CMV ) . If blood test show CMV blood level increase , may need treatment anti-viral antibiotic control viral infection . You doctor also give antibiotic take mouth prevent possible infection . If tumor grow treatment experience intolerable ( bad ) side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . Within 3 week last dose alemtuzumab , physical exam , routine blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) , CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis , bone marrow biopsy ( need ) . These test help show whether tumor shrink therapy . If test show tumor growing , place observation tumor status check every 3 month repeat similar test . This investigational study . Alemtuzumab FDA approve treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia commercially available . However , FDA approve alemtuzumab treatment Hodgkin 's disease . Furthermore , FDA approve injection alemtuzumab skin treatment cancer . A maximum 35 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
