	<criteria>Histological cytological confirmation extensive small cell lung cancer . For study , extensive stage disease define include patient whose disease encompass curative radiation field . While definition varies treat center , include patient metastatic disease contralateral lung parenchyma organ ( e.g . liver ) may include patient contralateral supraclavicular , mediastinal , hilar lymph node pleural effusion . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan . No history prior chemotherapy experimental therapy extensive recurrent small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . Subjects may receive chemotherapy part treatment limited disease , chemotherapy must complete least 6 month prior diagnosis recurrent disease . Prior radiation therapy permit acute side effect resolve ; site radiation measurable tumor site ; le 25 % bone marrow treat . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use pemetrexed combination gemcitabine patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . ECOG performance status 01 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/uL ; absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/uL ; platelet &gt; 100,000/uL ; total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X institutional limit ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2 X institutional limit OR &lt; 3 time upper limit normal presence liver metastases ; serum sodium &gt; 125 mEq/L syndrome inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( SIADH ) ; creatinine within normal institutional limit ; AND creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min Cockroft Gault formula patient creatinine level institutional normal . Brain metastasis permit radiation administer , subject recover , corticosteroid require . The effect pemetrexed gemcitabine develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason antifolate agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition pemetrexed gemcitabine . Pleural effusion , unless small , asymptomatic , thoracentesis perform render small asymptomatic prior enrollment . Patients significant ascites ineligible . Evidence superior vena cava syndrome threat imminent obstruction central vessel major airway . Extensive liver involvement tumor significant degree progression would increase subject 's risk morbidity mortality . A major , symptomatic , paraneoplastic syndrome SIADH , EatonLambert , Cushing 's syndrome , encephalomyelitis , etc . A history prior concurrent malignancy situ carcinoma cervix adequately treat basal cell carcinoma skin malignancy treat &gt; 5 year previously without evidence recurrence . Significant comorbidity judgement investigator would increase subject 's risk toxicity death study . Pregnant woman exclude study pemetrexed agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother pemetrexed gemcitabine , breastfeed discontinue mother treat either agent . Candidates unwilling unable take vitamin supplementation dexamethasone outline protocol ; unwilling unable interrupt nonsteroidal antiinflammatories salicylate ( ASA ) outline protocol .</criteria>
