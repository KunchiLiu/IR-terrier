	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Many veteran hypertension poorly control blood pressure ( BP ) ; new strategy quality improvement need . A new model care delivery , Group Medical Visits , hold promise mean improve blood pressure control enhance patient ' self-efficacy self-management chronic disease . Objectives The override goal implementation project translate research finding management hypertension practice thereby improve patient outcome , i.e. , adequacy control BP , patient hypertension . Specific objective develop implement model group medical visit iterative step ; evaluate whether group medical visit improve patient adherence prescribe antihypertensive medication improve BP control ; ass patient , physician , health care system factor involve successfully make organizational change encompass group medical visit . Methods Study site : primary care clinic VA Palo Alto . Study Design : staircase design 2 step design/implementation/formative-evaluation/redesign increase number participant , follow 3rd step evaluate final model . Participants : primary care provider ( MDs RNPs ) patient hypertension . Participating primary care provider ( PCPs ) randomly allocate 2:1 Group Visits ( GV ) intervention : control ; patient intervention PCPs also randomly allocate 2:1 , yield 3 study arm ( patient GV-PCPs enrol GVs ; patient GV-PCPs GVs , patient non-GV-PCPs ) . This design allow comparison control patient primary care provider conduct group visit primary care provider participate group medical appointment intervention . Intervention : group medical visit patient PCP . Group visit include education medical care component . Organizational component : tracking organizational issue establish program group visit ; interview key stakeholder identify barrier facilitator implement new model care . Outcome measure : patient ' blood pressure ( BPs ) , medication adherence , satisfaction , health-related quality life ; PCP satisfaction ; qualitative analysis theme interview patient , physician , medical center factor involve make organizational change encompass group visit . Findings We exceed target enrollment primary care provider ( PCPs ) total 16 ( 11 intervention , 5 control ) .

We also enrol additional 12 staff member interview , include one PCP elect participate . Study arm comparison make final data collection complete . In formative evaluation find patient medical need meet group set patient PCPs satisfy GV format . PCPs patient request GVs continue study end . Space GVs major barrier particularly light ongoing construction clinic building . Status We Step 3 plan end intervention phase end March 2006 complete final data collection soon thereafter . Impact Group Medical visit new model health care delivery hold promise improve patient access , patient provider satisfaction , clinical outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects include health care professional patient . The included health care professional primary care clinician practice VA Palo Alto panel patient provide primary care . Included patient patient primary care clinician ; patient must diagnosis hypertension least one blood pressure previous year guidelinetarget patient , patient must approve primary care clinician suitable group medical visit . Primary care clinicians small patient panel ( small recruitment patient group visit ) ae exclude . Patients exclude primary care clinician use clinical judgment ; typical reason exclusion include terminal illness , dementia would make patient unable participate group discussion . Because primary care clinician locate main study site provide primary care child , child include sample .</criteria>
