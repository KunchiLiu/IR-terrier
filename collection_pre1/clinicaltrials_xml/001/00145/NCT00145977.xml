	<detailed_description>The study propose application part large project entitle `` Clinical utility radiographic texture analysis diagnose treat osteoporosis '' . The overall goal large project determine whether computerized texture analysis digitize high-resolution image trabecular bone ( texture analysis ) improve ability diagnose bone fragility follow natural history and/or response pharmacological therapy osteoporosis . In CRC study propose plan examine change result texture analysis two year pharmacological therapy osteoporosis . Role densitometry osteoporosis : Measurement bone mineral density principal diagnostic method use clinical practice research study , identify patient disease follow response therapeutic agent . The technique use widely dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , advantage low cost radiation exposure , high precision accuracy 1-2 % 4-8 % , respectively [ 1 , 2 ] . Based association low BMD increase risk fracture [ 3 ] , BMD-based treatment guideline develop [ 4 ] . There , however , considerable overlap BMD patient sustain fragility fracture [ 5-9 ] . The problem arise fragility determine quantity bone ( measure bone density ) , also `` quality '' believe related preservation normal trabecular pattern [ 10 ] . Bone quality specifically assess use current diagnostic method . Information bone quality , however , would substantial clinical scientific value , would complement BMD measurement select patient therapy study bone loss assess effect therapeutic agent . Texture analysis : A novel approach noninvasive practical assessment bone structure analyze texture high resolution radiograph trabecular bone [ 11 ] . Dr. Giger , Professor Radiology co-investigator application , develop method characterize bone structure computerize texture analysis digitize high-resolution radiograph [ 12-16 ] . In approach , texture analyze several way , include Fourier base analysis , yield root mean square ( RMS ) measure magnitude trabecular bone texture pattern , first moment power spectrum ( FMP ) characterize texture pattern 's frequency [ 13 , 15 , 16 ] ; Minkowski dimension fractal analysis [ 17-20 ] . Radiographic texture analysis study vivo , lumbar spine radiograph find predict presence vertebral fracture elsewhere spine reliably BMD spine [ 13 , 14 ] . In addition , vitro study texture feature well BMD analyze femoral neck specimen obtain surgical hip replacement . Mechanical loading ( crush test ) perform cubes trabecular bone machine specimen determine bone strength . It find combination BMD texture analysis predict bone strength well BMD alone [ 12 , 15 , 16 ] . Biochemical marker bone turnover : In study osteoporosis , bone mass assess measure BMD metabolic activity bone assess measure biochemical marker bone turnover [ 21 ] . These marker limit utility individual patient high within-person variability ( low precision ) , clear marker useful clinical situation [ 21 , 22 ] . In contrast , compare biochemical marker group patient clinical study find useful two setting . Firstly , find high level biochemical marker bone resorption predict fracture independent BMD [ 23 , 24 ] . Secondly , early change bone marker ( 3-6 month ) anti-resorptive therapy predict later change BMD fracture rate [ 25-28 ] . The mechanisms underlying observation elucidate date . It speculate increase bone resorption , reflect elevation biochemical marker bone turnover , increase fragility weaken trabecular structure prior independent measurable BMD change . Similarly , decrease bone resorption pharmacological therapy likely improve trabecular structure independent effect BMD . Since aim research ( indirectly ) examine trabecular structure perform radiographic texture analysis , plan determine whether change biochemical marker bone turnover antiresorptive therapy correlate change result texture analysis . Rationale study : Anti-resorptive therapy reduce bone fragility increase bone density . It likely trabecular structure bone also change treatment . Peripheral densitometry use far monitor response therapy . If combination texture analysis peripheral BMD change reproducibly treatment may possible employ combination monitor therapeutic response . In , one could avoid need use central densitometry biochemical marker bone turnover since former cumbersome latter suffers low precision . Potential advantage use portable peripheral densitometer : The texture analyse describe developed high-resolution radiograph , digitize subject computer analysis . The new DXA image system GE/Lunar PIXI use research , provide digital image resolution sufficient computerized texture analysis ( 200 micron pixel ) . Furthermore , PIXI generate image short time ( second vs. minute ) fraction radiation dose conventional radiograph . Finally , since portable densitometer , methodology develop proposal potential widely applicable large segment population , include frail elderly limited mobility high prevalence osteoporosis . Future Directions : If find preliminary study texture feature change antiresorptive therapy , future study design examine change precisely . With result present study know magnitude change texture analysis expect therapy able accurately calculate sample size study change . Most interestingly , however , compare texture analysis therapy different pharmacological agent . Specifically , compare anabolic agent PTH antiresorptive therapy biphosphonates estrogen may provide important information mechanism action time effect bone structure different agent . Another direction research test whether combination BMD texture analysis portable instrument could use monitor therapy , particularly primary care set long-term care institution . To test , conduct study compare outcomes cost-effectiveness approach decision regard treatment change base BMD texture analysis portable instrument conventional approach base periodic monitoring central densitometry without use biochemical marker bone turnover . STUDY PROCEDURES The study perform outpatient facility University Chicago GCRC . Every 3 month first 6 month every 6 month reminder 2 year , subject come morning fast state , provide urine sample ( second morning void ) blood sample measurement biochemical marker bone turnover . Height weight record visit , change health status , include fracture ascertain . We also assess factor know influence bone turnover , diet physical activity . Every 12 month , subject fill Block food frequency questionnaire Berkley Nutrition Services [ 29 ] . In addition , every 6 month fill calcium intake questionnaire ( included Appendix ) , analyze CRC nutritionist short physical activity questionnaire , use PEPI trial [ 30 ] assessment physical activity . Medication compliance assess question patient count number calcium alendronate tablet remain previous visit . After test complete , subject go densitometry suite Endocrinology clinic BMD measure heel image obtain texture analysis . The left heel scan twice use PIXI densitometer ( GE/Lunar corporation ) measurement BMD heel texture analysis . ( If deformity leave heel , right heel use examination . ) In addition , every 6 month , BMD lumbar spine proximal femur measure use central densitometer Prodigy ( GE/Lunar corporation ) . The instrument use lateral vertebral assessment ( method use detect vertebral deformity image lateral spine densitometer ) , perform every 12 month .</detailed_description>
