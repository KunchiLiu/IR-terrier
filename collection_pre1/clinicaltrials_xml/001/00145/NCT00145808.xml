	<detailed_description>Subjects undergo blood draw wireless capsule endoscopy ( WCE ) . The blood draw occur GI procedure unit day subject exam . WCE : Subject consume clear liquid diet noon day prior exam . No food beverage consumption 10 PM day examination . Not oral medication 12 AMon day exam ( 8 hour subject 's exam ) . Day exam , subject report endoscopy unit . At time , subject prepared examination doctor apply sensor array abdomen adhesive sleeve . In addition , waist belt device hold data recorder fit subject . Subjects swallow capsule endoscope . The capsule endoscope pass naturally digestive tract transmit video image data recorder worn belt approximately eight hour . At point , subject free leave University Chicago hospital return eight hour later disconnection record equipment . Two hour ingestion capsule , subject able resume clear liquid diet . Four hour study 's start time , subject able resume regular diet ( solid food ) . At time , subject also able resume take oral medication .
