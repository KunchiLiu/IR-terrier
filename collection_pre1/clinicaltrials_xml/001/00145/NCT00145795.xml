	<brief_summary>Our goal determine change therapy one containing Kaletra improve immune response patient previously immune partial responder non-responders . We also interest know agent improve immune response affect cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) + T cell death ( apoptosis ) inhibiting ( prevent ) ongoing , low-level , viral replication level detection current viral load measurement . This help u understand immune response effective antiretroviral therapy different help determine possible guideline manage patient poor immune response . Hypothesis : Patients poor immune response HAART receive Kaletra place current PI Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) continue current 2 NRTI backbone improve immune response therapy compare patient continue current regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Research Study See Change Therapy HIV Infection Can Improve Immune Response Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To knowledge study first study show persistent apoptosis subgroup patient complete viral suppression association poor immune recovery . Immune alteration independent active viral replication may responsible . Recent data suggest immune response antiretroviral therapy depend residual restore thymic function . Improved CD4+ count patient despite virologic treatment failure associate great thymic function , poor T cell response despite suppression HIV see decrease thymic function . Discordant immune response may also due differential effect particular antiretroviral agent T cell apoptosis independent viral suppression . For example , protease inhibitor show decrease rate apoptosis uninfected T cell . Viral replication never completely suppressed HAART , even patient undetectable plasma HIV RNA . Therefore , vary degree low level viral replication replication certain cellular compartment may continue drive T cell apoptosis . Finally , data suggests ex vivo rate Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) apoptosis could potentially use predict immune recovery identify subgroup patient may benefit change HAART adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy . At time , although excellent guideline evaluate change therapy patient virologic failure , recommendation little data approach strategy change therapy patient poor immune response . Kaletra ( lopinavir/ritonavir ) may benefit patient poor immune response HAART despite viral suppression . Kaletra may great potency good suppression viral replication level detection plasma polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) HIV-1 RNA . Kaletra also excellent pharmacokinetic profile may result superior inhibition T cell apoptosis vivo .</detailed_description>
