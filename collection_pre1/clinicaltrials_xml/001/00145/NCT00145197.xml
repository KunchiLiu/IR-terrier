	<brief_title>Reducing Underuse Early-Stage Breast Cancer Treatment Minority Communities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efficacious adjuvant treatment radiotherapy follow breast conserve surgery , chemo- hormonal therapy stage 1b 2 breast cancer improve disease-free overall survival . Lower rate radiotherapy follow breast-conserving surgery report among black woman . Few data exist racial disparity receipt chemo- hormonal therapy ; however , poor stage-specific survival rate among black among woman poor insurance suggest underuse treatment . Despite elimination racial disparity rate mammography screening , full benefit screen realize unless underuse effective treatment early-stage breast cancer eliminate . Little known reason underuse treatment way increase treatment rate . Our preliminary work suggest omit referral lack follow-up tracking account majority underuse particularly among minority patient . The propose breast cancer project measure extent underuse efficacious breast cancer treatment among patient hospital serve East Central Harlem minority community low Manhattan . We first interview physician patient reason omission efficacious adjuvant treatment . At 6 participate hospital , implement intervention consist : ) computerize reminder prompt surgeon refer patient adjuvant treatment , b ) individual track referral receipt adjuvant treatment . We assess racial/ethnic difference rate underuse explore racial difference reason underuse . We assess impact intervention reduce underuse efficacious therapy among 2 year 695 pre-intervention 2 year 695 post-intervention patient . This study provide new knowledge racial disparity treatment early-stage breast cancer ; patient physician reason underuse ; effectiveness simple , sustainable intervention improve rate efficacious adjuvant treatment .</detailed_description>
