	<brief_summary>Patients suffer diabetes many year risk develop late diabetic complication include change eye , kidney , vessels nerve . Late complication postpone avoided assuring good diabetes control , i.e . sensible diet , exercise , frequent blood glucose measurement good medical treatment . Blood glucose regulation depend two different factor i.e . insulin need body amount insulin body . The amount insulin , blood , decide amount insulin infuse daily , whereas insulin need depend patient 's weight , physical activity diet . Overweight type 2 diabetes patient large insulin need especially need decisive development diabetes . If patient treat Metformin , blood glucose decrease result easy weight loss patient . Especially , patient take drug , development late diabetic complication , especially arteriosclerosis , avoid postpone . Whether favourable effect Metformin also present type 1 diabetic patient remain fully clarify , study indicate case . This result good regulation diabetes small insulin dose one give patient . Metformin probably take effect increase glucose uptake muscle reduce hepatic glucose production . The drug usually side-effects , patient , however , suffer abdominal pain , small tendency nausea , loose defaecation metallic taste mouth . These side-effects often temporary . Project description In total , 50 type 1 diabetic patient offer participate project . All outpatient clinic Department Endocrinology . The project last 7 month divide follow : 1 . An introductory period one month introduce optimisation insulin treatment 2 . A 6 month period ( neither patient treat doctor know medication give ) either T. Metformin treatment twice daily T. Placebo ( lime ) twice daily together usual insulin treatment four time daily . Choice either T. Metformin T. Placebo make draw , state , drug type unknown patient treat doctor order make sure investigation objective possible . Throughout examination period , patient ask measure blood glucose four time daily , i.e . main meal bed time . These value use regulate fast insulin dose help treat doctor , adjust daily insulin dose . During first last two day examination period also ask patient measure blood glucose 03h00 two day . Those diurnal profile include evaluation blood glucose control treatment period . Furthermore , patient ' blood pressure determine 24 hour 6 month ' treatment period . This carry automatically mean blood pressure cuff around arm connect small apparatus register value 24 hour . The apparatus take home installation outpatient clinic carry around belt around waist next day apparatus dismantle . At first last 5 outpatient visit , blood test take ( evaluation long-term blood glucose , kidney , liver , insulin fat blood ) nocturnal urine must collect disposed order evaluate protein secretion thereby kidney function .</brief_summary>
