	<brief_summary>The Spiration Intra-Bronchial Valve intend use minimally invasive treatment severe emphysema , use standard bronchoscopy . The valve design limit airflow select portion lung , produce reduction lung volume , may improve pulmonary function patient emphysema .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Spiration IBV™ System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study open enrollment , prospective study subject serve control . The sponsor may attempt include data study statistical analysis pivotal study . This proposal shall evaluate conclusion pilot study . PATIENT POPULATION Patients severe emphysema eligible screen enrollment study . In initial pilot study , eligible subject severe , heterogeneous , predominantly upper lobe emphysema , define American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) 1 NETT Research Group.2 These subject also patient screen potential candidate LVRS , exclude surgical treatment due failure satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion establish NETT Research Group LVRS.2 Patients also able tolerate flexible bronchoscopy procedure . Patients screen accepted lung transplant procedure LVRS , currently register schedule procedure , eligible enrollment pilot study . Patients FEV1 &lt; 20 % predict either homogeneous emphysema DLCO &lt; 20 % exclude enrollment pilot study.3 Patients screen enrolled 115 subject undergone treatment IBV System . Up 15 clinical center select enroll treat subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male Female subject least 18 year age . Subject severe , heterogeneous , predominantly upper lobe emphysema . Subject ability meet goal , currently satisfy goal , comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program . Subject satisfy requirement postrehabilitation 6minute walk ≥ 140 6 able complete 3 min unload pedal exercise tolerance test . Subject abstain cigarette smoke 4 month , confirm urine serum cotinine test . Pulmonary function test result demonstrate : FEV1 ≤ 45 % predict ( ≥ 15 % predict age ≥ 70 year ) TLC ≥ 100 % predict RV ≥ 150 % predict Arterial blood gas level indicate : PCO2 ≤ 50 mm Hg PO2 ≥ 45 mm Hg room air ( Denver criterion : PO2 ≥ 30 mm Hg ) Subject coexist major medical problem would significantly increase risk bronchoscopy procedure classify ASA Class P4 low . If female , subject pregnant negative HCG pregnancy test within 7 day prior procedure . Subject willingness undertake risk morbidity associate required bronchoscopic procedure . Subject willingness participate study complete require followup visit . Subject ability provide inform consent . Subject provide consent treatment protocol grant access relevant medical record sponsor , Principal Investigator , institution , IRB FDA pertain current lung disease condition , evaluation process , surgical procedure . Patients FEV1 &lt; 20 % predict either homogeneous emphysema DLCO &lt; 20 % . 3 Subject unable provide inform consent . Subject appropriate candidate , unable tolerate , flexible bronchoscopy procedure . Subject dysrhythmia might pose risk exercise training . Subject rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beats/min ) ; frequent multifocal PVCs ; complex ventricular arrhythmia ; sustain SVT . Subject history exerciserelated syncope . Subject uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic , &gt; 200 mm ; diastolic &gt; 110 mm ) . Subject history recurrent infection clinically significant sputum production Subject know , active asthma , chronic bronchitis clinically significant bronchiectasis . Subject giant bulla ( &gt; 1/3 volume lung ) . Subject pulmonary hypertension : peak systolic PPA , ≥ 45 mm Hg ( Denver criterion : ≥ 50 mm Hg ) mean PPA , ≥ 35 mm Hg ( Denver criterion : ≥ 38 mm Hg ) . ( Right heart catheter require rule pulmonary hypertension peak systolic PPA echocardiogram ≥ 45 mm Hg . ) Subject requirement &gt; 6 L O2 keep saturation ≥ 90 % exercise . Subject evidence systemic disease neoplasia expect compromise survival 1year study period . Subject demonstrate 6MWT distance ≤ 140 rehabilitation . Subject disease condition interfere completion initial followup assessment . Subject demonstrate unwillingness inability complete screen baseline data collection procedure . Subject homogeneous emphysema pattern . Subject classify ASA Class great P4 7 include presence comorbidity could significantly increase risk standard bronchoscopy procedure .</criteria>
