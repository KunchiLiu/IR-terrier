	<brief_summary>The purpose study see administration sildenafil ( Viagra ) patient portopulmonary hypertension could safe effective treatment . Portopulmonary hypertension ( PTPH ) special type pulmonary hypertension . Pulmonary hypertension high blood pressure pulmonary artery carry unoxygenated blood right ventricle heart lung . Pulmonary hypertension result constriction , tighten , blood vessel supply blood lung . Consequently , become difficult blood pas lung , make hard heart pump blood forward . This stress heart lead enlargement heart eventually fluid build liver tissue , leg . Affected patient sometimes notice increase shortness breath dizziness . There grow body evidence suggest potential therapeutic role sildenafil patient primary pulmonary hypertension . Studies ongoing regard area . Our hypothesis chronic oral sildenafil successfully reduce pulmonary artery pressure least 25 % ( reduction mean pulmonary artery pressure ) could effective treatment PTPH , especially candidate liver transplantation Primary Hypothesis To measure effect single dose sildenafil pulmonary arterial pressure patient PTPH Secondary Hypothesis To measure effect chronic ( 3 month ) treatment sildenafil pulmonary arterial pressure , safety , tolerability patient PTPH</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sildenafil Pulmonary Artery Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center ( take place University Chicago ) , open-label ( doctor subject know subject take experimental drut ) , pilot study evaluate effect sildenafil pulmonary artery pressure patient portopulmonary hypertension . Patients diagnose PTPH routine care right heart catheterization ask interested participating . Approximately ten subject enrol . Subjects undergo follow experimental procedure part participation study : blood laboratory test , medical history , physical exam , inhale nitric oxide test , study drug ( sildenafil ) administration , pill count . Sildenafil give patient 3 time day 12 week period see study drug lower pulmonary artery pressure least 25 % .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Candidates enrollment clinical trial limit adult patient diagnose severe portopulmonary hypertension ( PTPH ) . Specifically , cause pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) leave ventricular dysfunction , valvular heart disease , chronic lung disease , chronic thromboembolic disease , chronic hypoxemia , rheumatologic condition , significant untreated obstructive sleep apnea exclude usual fashion patient underlying portal hypertension usually cirrhosis . The diagnosis pulmonary hypertension confirm invasive hemodynamic measurement ( i.e . right heart catheterization ) severe PH define mean pulmonary artery pressure ( MPAP ) &gt; 35 mmHg . If evidence right ventricular ( RV ) dysfunction present ( RV dilation , reduce RV ejection fraction ( EF ) , elevate RV enddiastolic pressure ( &gt; 10 mmHg ) MPAP 3035 mmHg , patient may enrol . Study participant select patient referred hemodynamic assessment pulmonary hypertension , potential liver transplant recipient . They must capable give informed consent . The University Chicago refer physician contact concurrence agreement . Patients pulmonary arterial hypertension , portopulmonary hypertension exclude . Patients exclude consideration severe PTPH , invasive hemodynamic assessment contraindicate , contraindication sildenafil . Patients unstable coronary syndrome otherwise significant unrevascularized coronary artery disease myocardial ischemia determine cardiac stress test and/or coronary angiography also exclude . Moribund patient consider enrollment .</criteria>
