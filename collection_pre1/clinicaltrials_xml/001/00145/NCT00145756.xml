	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease lead cause death disability worldwide , blood pressure lead determinant risk . To date , strategy blood pressure lower focused drug treatment dietary intervention reduce sodium intake increase potassium intake may also effective . Such intervention may particularly suitable low- middle-income country significant dietary change may easily achieve . This study test effect salt substitute blood pressure , among individual high-risk cardiovascular disease Northern China .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>China Salt Substitute Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise trial clearly identify whether low-sodium , high-potassium salt-substitute feasible mean lower blood pressure high-risk individual rural China . The randomised design large size ( n=600 ) ensure result reliable precise . The 12-month duration address long-term practicability intervention strategy . The study conduct salt-substitute-based blood pressure lower may particularly appropriate rural population low- middle-income country . First , sodium intake often high . Second , salt-substitute easily incorporate diet food prepare eaten home . Third , intervention provide low cost . Comparisions : Low sodium high potassium salt ( 65 % sodium chloride , 25 % potassium chloride , 10 % magnesium sulphate ) compare normal salt ( 100 % sodium chloride ) .</detailed_description>
