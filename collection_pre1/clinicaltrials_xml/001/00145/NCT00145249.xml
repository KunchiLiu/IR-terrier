	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness safety combination treatment cryptococcal meningitis , fungal infection common person acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) develop world . The standard initial treatment include two medication : amphotericin B 2 week follow 8 week fluconazole . This study look whether study participant recover quickly few side effect give drug time 2 week follow 8 week fluconazole compare standard treatment . Participants follow approximately 6 month time enrol study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amphotericin Alone Combination With Fluconazole AIDS-Associated Meningitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design address need effective antifungal therapy cryptococcal meningitis . This prospective , randomize , open-label , multicenter phase II clinical trial combination therapy treatment acute cryptococcal meningitis HIV-positive subject . The primary study objective assess safety tolerability study drug regimen ; determine whether safety efficacy combination therapy support development phase III trial combination therapy , , select appropriate dose fluconazole plus amphotericin B base safety efficacy evaluate subsequent phase III trial . Secondary study objective include : compare efficacy study drug treatment 2 , 6 , 10 week ( Days 14 , 42 , 70 ) ; compare finding detailed neurological examination study arm baseline 2 , 6 , 10 , 24 week ( 6 month ) ; assess proportion subject study arm alive 6 month initiation study therapy ; describe effect baseline clinical , neurological , mycological characteristic mycological failure 2 10 week ; measure time cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) culture negatively study arm ; assess length hospitalization treatment group surrogate cost efficacy ; assess incidence immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome among subject receive highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) ; examine antifungal susceptibility cryptococcal isolates . Study participant include 150 subject age 13 older . Subjects randomly assign 1 3 treatment arm include 1 standard therapy 2 investigational arm . The standard treatment arm include amphotericin B 0.7 mg/kg ( IV ) 14 day follow 8 week ( 56 day ) fluconazole 400 mg/day orally . The 2 investigational arm include daily amphotericin B 0.7 mg/kg ( IV ) randomize dose fluconazole 400 mg/day 800 mg/day first 14 day , randomize dose fluconazole 400 mg/day 800 mg/day respectively additional 8 week ( 56 day ) . At completion study therapy , subject receive chronic suppressive therapy oral fluconazole dose least 200 mg/day . The safety endpoint consider primary endpoint study . The safety assessment treatment arm end study day 100 subject . The key safety endpoint incidence adverse experience grade 3-5 ( total attribute treatment regimen ) . The primary safety endpoint examine incidence grade 3-5 adverse experience definitely probably relate study drug , secondary analysis include grade 3-5 adverse experience , definitely probably possibly relate study drug . Another secondary safety endpoint number dose-limiting toxicity attribute treatment regimen . Key efficacy endpoint ( treatment success ) composite follow 3 mycologic clinical measure 14 , 42 , 70 day therapy : CSF culture conversion ; neurologically stable improve ; alive . Other secondary efficacy endpoint evaluate descriptively : CSF culture conversion multiple time point ; all-cause mortality ; length hospitalization ; incidence immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>First episode cryptococcal meningitis evidence positive cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) stain cryptococcal antigen , CSF culture pending Documentation proven diagnosis HIV1 infection acceptable labs time past : testing include Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) approve rapid test method confirmation Western blot , second positive ELISA , positive HIV antigen , HIV RNA detection . OR Presumptive diagnosis HIV1 approve rapid test method screening . This test must confirm second ELISA ( Western blot ) , positive HIV antigen , HIV RNA detection within 10 day study entry . OR Presumptive HIV+ . If serologic test available , history AIDSdefining illness ( Category C , CDC , 1993 ) follow condition : extrapulmonary Pneumocystis carinii disease ; multidermatomal herpes zoster ( &gt; 10 lesion noncontiguous site ) ; American trypanosomiasis ( Chagas disease ) CNS ; Penicillium marneffei disease ; visceral leishmaniasis ; nonHodgkin 's lymphoma celltype ; Hodgkin 's lymphoma ; bartonellosis ; microsporidiosis ( &gt; 1 month 's duration ) ; nocardiosis ; invasive aspergillosis ; Rhodococcus equi disease . Confirmation HIV infection lab testing , i.e. , ELISA approve rapid test method confirmation Western blot , second positive ELISA , positive HIV antigen , HIV RNA detection must perform within 10 day study entry . Subjects 13 year age great . Baseline electrocardiogram ( ECG ) QTc interval less equal 500 millisecond determine use Fredericia 's Correction formula . Ability subject legally authorize representative give inform consent . For subject unable provide inform consent , sit follow individual Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) policy regard informed consent process . Pregnancy . Urine serum testing must perform study entry within 7 day prior study entry . Women childbearing potential unwilling use medically approve highly effective form birth control study drug 2 week last dose . Acceptable form birth control include intrauterine device ( IUD ) , oral contraceptive , condom , abstinence , injectable contraceptive , highly effective mean birth control . ( A highly effective method birth control define result low failure rate [ i.e . le 1 percent per year ] use consistently correctly . ) Emergency contraceptive treatment coitus interruptus consider effective form contraception . Breastfeeding . A concurrent central nervous system ( CNS ) process opinion investigator would interfere assessment response , lymphoma , toxoplasmosis , tuberculosis . Other condition opinion investigator would jeopardize safety subject participating study would render subject unable comply study plan , homelessness IV drug use . Estimated creatinine clearance le 50 mL/min . NOTE : Testing must perform study entry within 7 day prior study entry . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) great 5x upper limit normal bilirubin great 2.5 x upper limit normal . Results test perform within 7 day prior study entry may use . Known intolerance allergy fluconazole amphotericin B . Subjects unlikely survive 2 week . Coma . More 3 day systemic antifungal therapy fungal infection , need concurrent systemic antifungal therapy , include flucytosine interferong . Subjects take fluconazole less equal 200 mg/day prophylaxis exclude . Inability take oral medication . Subjects receive follow drug within 7 day study enrollment : rifampin , rifamycin , rifabutin , phenytoin , carbamazepine , cyclosporin A , tacrolimus , sirolimus , longacting barbiturate . Subjects receive nevirapine baseline . Strong clinical suspicion untreated active tuberculosis . ( Patients antiTB therapy include rifampin rifamycin may eligible . ) Previous participation study ongoing participation another trial investigational drug . Prior case cryptococcosis diagnose central nervous system involvement .</criteria>
