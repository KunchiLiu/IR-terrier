Improved treatment method lead new think possible interrupt transmission eliminate major public health problem repeat , annual cycle mass treatment new single dose combination drug regimen . Egyptian village involve study survey . Household member 4 year age test filariasis . Also , child first year class primary school ( 5 6 year age ) test parasite infection . Village population treat filariasis part MOH national filariasis elimination program . Children age 5 , pregnant woman , people severe underlie illness exclude program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 100 million people infected Wuchereria bancrofti , mosquito-transmitted nemotade parasite cause deform lymphatic filariasis tropic . Improved therapy diagnostic method lead new think lymphatic filariasis realization possible interrupt transmission eliminate major public health problem repeat , annual cycle mass treatment new single dose combination drug regimen . The Egyptian Ministry Health institute annual mass therapy Albendazole ( ALB ) diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) filariasis endemic village country aim eliminate filariasis . This study comprise 4 different activity involve human subject : These Village study filariasis prevalence intensity , school study antibody prevalence , A treatment trial assessment infectivity human mosquito feed treatment . Pre-control evaluation village perform year 1 . Mass treatment conduct annually MOH , begin late year one early year 2 . Timing annual follow-up evaluation year 2-4 coordinate MOH specimen collect least 6 month mass treatment prior next distribution medication . It anticipate third follow-up collection complete end year 4 . A final set follow-up specimen collect year 5 time permit . The treatment trial compare effect diethylcarbamzine ( 6 mg/kg ) albendazole ( 400 mg ) give single dose , 7 consecutive daily dos , weekly 4 week . Antibody prevalence young child ( school study ) , 200-300/school ; infection prevalence study ( village study sample human mosquito ) , 100 house ( approx . 500 people ) per village ; treatment trial , n = 60 ( 20 per treatment group ) . The project attempt measure effect mass therapy tool develop prior study . It anticipate infection prevalence rate infection intensity decrease follow mass therapy . A successful program lead elimination filariasis time .</detailed_description>
