	<detailed_description>Setting : Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion send letter contain information study call within 2 week one investigator . If patient agree come fist visit invite first visit come general practice Heerde . Informed Consent : During telephone call first visit , patient able ask question . When patient properly inform give write informed consent patient include study . Specific item duration study , frequency follow-up visit , voluntary nature participation discuss prior obtain inform consent . Also , potential reproductive toxicity ( report know developmental toxicity study Cr3+ compound give orally ) , advice patient take contraceptive precaution ( 33 ) . Stop criterion : When patient possible drug intolerance patient ask contact u . We note every possible side effect . If serious side effect patient ask stop intervention medication . Power Sample Size Calculations : Sample size calculate use computer program G-power . Mean HbA1c patient HbA1c 7-8,5 % general practise region 7,70 % ( SD 0,44 ) . Powered detect 0,5 % absolute reduction HbA1c six-month follow-up patient treat chromium compare placebo patient . With power 95 % , alpha 0.05 2-tailed , total sample size 44 ( 22 first group 22 second group ) . Randomisation : 60 patient meet inclusion criterion randomly assign double-blind trial receive treatment A B addition current therapy six month . Method blind randomisation : drug package label randomisation code hospital pharmacy . Neither physician patient inform treatment . There delay study enrolment randomisation . Intervention : Two treatment protocol propose . Treatment A consist 400 microgram Bio-chromium/day treatment B consist placebo . One type chromium tablet make ; 100 microgram Cr/tablet . Placebo make appear identical chromium tablet . Patients instruct ingest 2 tablet study drug breakfast 2 diner . Measures : Medical history consist duration diabetes , diabetes medication , general medication , renal hepatic disease recent complaint . Body fat percentage measure use OMRON BF306 ( HBF-306-E ) . Patients weigh wear clothes bare foot . Length measure stand bare foot blood pressure measure patient sit position accord Dutch College General Practitioners ( 34 ) . Serum creatinine , hepatic enzyme ( PT ) , HbA1c , Haemoglobin ( Hb ) , fast glucose , fast insulin , serum total cholesterol , LDL , HDL , triglyceride measure baseline standard procedure hospital ( Weezenlanden Location , Isala Clinics ) . At baseline six month , also serum chromium measure . Extra citrate serum collection tube freeze additional measurement , need . Also 24-h urine collect baseline 6 month volume , creatinine , protein albumin measure . Three tube contain 2 cc urine frozen additional measurement . These ( extra ) analyse make give information approval patient , approval medical ethical committee . Follow : At baseline , appointment make follow visit appointment telephone call 4 week . During call , patient ask complaint start inclusion study . For stimulate compliance , patient ask use tablet . When different describe protocol , patient advise accordingly . Furthermore , patient able ask question telephone call . Patients call u possible adverse toxic effect drug office hour . After 3 month , HbA1c Hb measure . The measure describe , except length measure baseline 6 month . Handling loss follow-up : Patients withdraw study medication receive regular follow-up end 6-month follow-up period .</detailed_description>
