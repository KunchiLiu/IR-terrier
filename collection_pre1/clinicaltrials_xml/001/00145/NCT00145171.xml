	<brief_title>A Sub-Study With Patients APO401 Evaluate Adverse Events During Dose Introduction Apomorphine-naïve Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine electrocardiographic orthostatic effect apomorphine control in-patient dose introduction apomorphine-naïve late stage Parkinson ’ disease patient . Although safety observation represent primary objective study , control group consider essential properly interpret adverse event occur dose titration . Additional data comparing efficacy safety subcutaneous apomorphine , placebo standard antiparkinson ( anti-PD ) therapy derive experience . This two-phase study involve control in-office dose titration phase follow 6-month outpatient open-label treatment phase . During in-patient dose titration phase , subject evaluate separate day response single dose medication administer observed “ Off ” event ( define first “ Off ” event occur least one hour administration normal morning dose oral antiparkinson medication ) . Evaluation acute response oral anti-PD medication ( Baseline ) apomorphine dose escalation 2 10 mg ( Titration Visits ) conduct unblinded condition . At 0.4-mL titration level , placebo randomly introduce double-blind crossover condition .</detailed_description>
