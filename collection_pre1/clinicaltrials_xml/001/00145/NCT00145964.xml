	<brief_summary>Primary biliary cirrhosis ( PBC ) disease liver , predominantly affect woman . It cause slowly progressive liver disease , eventually cause liver failure , require liver transplant . Several different study large patient cohort indicate cause disease likely due combination factor include genetic environmental . PBC associate several `` autoimmune disease '' - recently gene identify abnormal individual another autoimmune liver disease , namely rheumatoid arthritis . This gene usually tell body switch immune response . This study plan identify whether individual diagnose PBC similar abnormality gene call protein Tyrosine Phosphatase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Genetic Variants Responsible Primary Biliary Cirrhosis ( PBC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Very recently , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) PTPN22 gene encode Lyp ( lymphoid-specific phosphatase ) PTP show associated susceptibility rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) 4,5 . These data consistent know role Lyp suppress T cell activation data show T cell activation ( potentially autoreactivity ) increase RA T1D-associated PTPN22 variant . The PTPN22 risk allele also recently implicate Grave â€™ disease appear represent susceptibility allele many autoimmune disease . As number condition ( RA , T1D etc . ) frequently occur within member PBC family , PTPN22 variant likely also involve PBC , possibility directly investigate pilot study . The aim study analyze frequency specific PTPN22 polymorphism patient PBC .</detailed_description>
