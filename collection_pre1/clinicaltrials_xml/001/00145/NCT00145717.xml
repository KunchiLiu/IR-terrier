	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PLAN The study randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial three parallel group , two assign different dos active treatment one assign placebo . The total study period participant average seven week comprise two-week placebo treatment run-in period prior randomisation five-week follow-up randomise treatment . An estimated 400 participant commence run-in expectation 300 ( 100 group ) go randomisation . STUDY TREATMENTS Pre-randomisation open run-in phase : All potentially eligible participant commence 10-20 day run-in period placebo milk tea administered twice daily . This run-in period help identify randomisation , individual unlikely tolerate milk tea product comply study follow procedure . Post randomisation double-blind treatment phase : Participants successfully complete run-in phase assign random receive either : - Milk tea contain total 2.3g plant sterol day administer two divided dos 1.15g ; - Milk tea contain total 1.5g plant sterol day administer two divided dos 0.75g ; - Placebo milk tea contain plant sterol . Blinding participant investigator assure provide group allocate treatment packaging identical except unique identify number correspond randomisation code . Comparisions : - 2.3g/d treatment group compare placebo group - 1.5g/d treatment group compare placebo group - active treatment group ( 2.3g/d 1.5g/d combine ) compare placebo group - 2.3g/d treatment group compare 1.5g/d treatment group - Secondary : To establish effect intervention total cholesterol level .</detailed_description>
