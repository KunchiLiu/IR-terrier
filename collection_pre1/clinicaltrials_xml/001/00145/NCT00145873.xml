	<brief_summary>The purpose study look safety effectiveness long term intravenous ( IV ) infusion study drug , nesiritide patient acutely decompensated chronic heart failure . Nesiritide ( Natrecor ) man-made version human hormone dilate vein artery . Nesiritide ( Natrecor ) currently FDA-approved short-term inpatient IV treatment acutely decompensated chronic heart failure . Hypothesis : Nesiritide , administer continuous intravenous infusion outpatient setting , safe treatment refractory Class III &amp; IV chronic heart failure due systolic diastolic dysfunction , regardless renal function administer 12-week period . Corollary # 1 : Nesiritide , infuse continuously 12 week improve overall condition patient chronic heart failure . These mechanism include reduce hospitalization compare previous six month , improve symptom measure Minnesota Living Heart Failure short questionnaire , improve functional capacity measure 6-minute walk test . Corollary # 2 : Nesiritide infusion associate statistically significant decrease N-terminal pro-BNP level cyclic GMP level compare patient receive placebo infusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single center , double-blinded , crossover , placebo-controlled pilot study evaluate effect nesiritide patient chronic heart failure . This study take place University Chicago Hospitals . It double-blinded , mean neither subject study doctor know study drug subject receive . However , emergency , information obtain quickly . The study placebo-controlled , mean subject receive study drug point study ; however cross-over study , subject receive nesiritide point study . Subjects receive study drug nesiritide six 12 week studyâ€”either first six week last six week . The procedure study consist : informed consent , question subject heart failure , blood sample , assessment heart failure severity base symptom , six minute walk test Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaire , history heart failure symptom emergency room visit , diuretic baseline medication history , long term IV medication infusion , adjustment study drug regularly take medication , 6 week receive long term IV infusion drug , blood take lab test clinic visit informational card provide subject use on-call physician . Up ten consecutive patient decline participation study ask participate registry follow course study interval . Baseline data , obtain medical record record number hospitalizations/ER visit NYHA class study period . These subject survey telephone monthly duration study .</detailed_description>
