	<brief_summary>Relapsed disease common cause death child hematological malignancy . Patients fail high-intensity conventional chemotherapeutic regimen relapse stem cell transplantation poor prognosis . Toxicity multiple therapy elevate leukemic/tumor burden usually make patient ineligible aggressive chemotherapy regimen require conventional stem cell transplantation . Alternative option need . One type treatment explore call haploidentical transplant . Conventional blood bone marrow stem cell transplant involve destroy patient 's diseased marrow radiation chemotherapy . Healthy marrow donor infuse patient migrates bone marrow space begin generate new blood cell . The best type donor sibling unrelated donor identical immune system ( HLA `` match '' ) . However , patient match sibling available and/or unable identify acceptable unrelated donor registry timely manner . In addition , aggressive treatment require prepare body type transplant toxic highly pretreated patient . Therefore doctor investigate haploidentical transplant use stem cell HLA partially match family member donor . Although haploidentical transplant proven curative many patient , procedure hinder significant complication , primarily regimen-related toxicity include graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , infection due delay immune reconstitution . These , part , due certain white blood cell graft call T cell . GVHD happen donor T cell recognize patient 's ( host ) body tissue different attack cell . Although many T cell increase possibility GVHD , may cause recipient 's immune system reconstitute slowly graft fail grow , leave patient high-risk infection . However , presence T cell graft may offer positive effect call graft versus malignancy GVM . With GVM , donor T cell recognize patient 's malignant cell diseased , turn , attack diseased cell . For reason , primary focus researcher engineer graft provide T cell deplete product reduce risk GVHD , yet provide sufficient number cell facilitate immune reconstitution , graft integrity GVM . In study , patient give haploidentical graft engineer specific T cell parameter value use CliniMACS system . A reduced intensity , preparative regimen use reduce regimen-related toxicity mortality . The primary goal study evaluate overall survival receive study treatment .</brief_summary>
