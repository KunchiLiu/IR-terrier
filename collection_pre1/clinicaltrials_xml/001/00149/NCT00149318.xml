	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Fabry disease X-linked error glycosphingolipid catabolism cause deficient activity lysosomal hydrolase α-galactosidase A ( α-gal A ) tissue fluid affect hemizygous male ; heterozygous female intermediate level enzymatic activity . The enzymatic defect lead systemic deposition glycosphingolipids , predominantly globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) , body fluid lysosomes endothelial , perithelial , smooth-muscle cell blood vessel . Deposition also occur ganglion cell . Clinical manifestation classically affect hemizygotes ( absent α-gal A activity ) , include pain paresthesias extremity , vessel ectasia ( angiokeratoma ) skin mucous membrane , hypohidrosis childhood adolescence . Corneal lenticular opacity early finding . With increase age , proteinuria renal impairment lead hypertension uremia . Renal failure typically occur third-fifth decade life , patient need chronic hemodialysis and/or renal transplantation . Atypical hemizygotes residual α-gal A activity may asymptomatic late-onset , mild disease manifestation primarily limit heart ( `` cardiac variant '' ) . Recently renal variant identify . Heterozygous female may attenuate form disease.The frequent clinical finding female characteristic whorl-like corneal epithelial dystrophy . They usually asymptomatic , although rarely severely affected hemizygous male . In kidney accumulation glycosphingolipids appear sequence endothelial epithelial cell glomerulus Bowman 's space , epithelium loop Henle distal tubule till proximal tubule , interstitial histiocyte fibrocytes . Lipid-laden distal tubular epithelial cell desquamate may detect urinary sediment . Renal blood vessel may involve progressively extensively . An early finding arterial fibrinoid deposit . Other histologic renal finding severe arteriolar sclerosis , glomerular atrophy fibrosis , pseudotubular proliferation residual glomerular epithelium , tubular atrophy diffuse interstitial fibrosis . Preliminary study enzyme replacement therapy demonstrate periodic infusion recombinant human α-galactosidase A safe effective patient Fabry disease . The purpose study evaluate long term efficacy enzyme replacement therapy patient Fabry disease renal involvement . AIM Primary - To evaluate effect enzyme replacement therapy rate decline glomerular filtration rate ( GFR , measure inulin clearance ) Fabry patient renal involvement - To evaluate biological activity recombinant human galactosidase term clearance plasma Gb3 ( directly correlate renal endothelial glycosphingolipid clearance ) Secondary To evaluate effect enzyme replacement therapy : - 24-hour urinary protein excretion - renal plasma flow ( PAH renal clearance ) - glomerular perm-selectivity ( fractional dextran clearance ) - end stage renal failure , kidney transplantation death - systolic diastolic blood pressure - cardiac anomaly ( leave ventricular hypertrophy , arrhythmia , conduction anomaly ) - cutaneous anomaly - ocular anomaly DESIGN Twenty patient ( male female ) Fabry disease , renal involvement , refer SMIMAF - Studio Multicentrico Italiano sulla Malattia di Anderson-Fabry - enrol study .</detailed_description>
