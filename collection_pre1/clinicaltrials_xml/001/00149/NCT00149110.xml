	<detailed_description>Protocol synopsis Background : The Psychiatric Research Unit Frederiksborg General Hospital , professor Per Bech drive force , work sleep relation affective disorder many year . During last 4 year perform involved several light therapy study depression , seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) , light augmentation strategy nonseasonal depression , post-stroke depression Tourette 's syndrome . In relation dissemination result Klaus Martiny 's Ph.D. thesis bright light therapy augment strategy major depression , research unit achieve close collaboration world 's leading expert chronotherapeutics : Professor Anna Wirz-Justice Basel , Switzerland , Franscesco Benedetti Milano , Italy , Michael Terman New York , Mathias Berger Freiburg , Germany Joseph Wu University California , Irvine . The basic idea present study come group many year perform report clinical study chronotherapeutics . We hope research unit able conduct study , require , large patient sample guidance group . The study fulfill research unit 's ambition investigate antidepressive treatment algorithms propensity lead earlier sustained onset action high remission rate . Remission depression restore patient ' normal social functioning , also reduce risk recurrence depression . To attain goal regard combination new powerful antidepressive drug non-pharmacological therapy interest promising . This study full support hospital administration welcome active involvement nursing staff chronotherapeutic part . The present study incorporate combination duloxetine chronotherapeutics : sleep deprivation , sleep phase advance , light therapy . Duloxetine new dual action antidepressant drug show early onset action high remission rate , acceptable side effect . It thus promise drug new study . Chronotherapeutic approach total partial sleep deprivation , phase advance sleep-wake cycle , light therapy investigate last thirty year . Total partial sleep deprivation second half night phase advance sleep-wake cycle show rapid profound effect depress mood diagnostic subgroup . Sleep deprivation attains immediate response around 60 % case small report study use combination sleep deprivation lithium , antidepressant drug , pindolol , sleep phase advance , morning light therapy indicate response initial sleep deprivation maintain . Light treatment become accept effective treatment seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) , recent study document accelerate augmented response non-seasonal , even chronic depression , adjunctive treatment medication . The combination effect chronotherapeutics new powerful antidepressant drug thus interest promise approach . While light treatment widely use , sleep deprivation sleep phase advance therapy need study sufficient number patient evaluate applicability efficacy . Objectives : Duloxetine , new dual action drug , show promise efficacy early onset action high remission rate short- long-term treatment . Thus , Raskin find impressive remission rate 50.8 % six week 81.8 % 52 week treatment . The primary objective present study examine whether combination duloxetine chronotherapeutic method induce high remission rate earlier time point obtain 50 % percent remission rate three week treatment . Study design : The study randomise control , semi-blind ( rater-blind ) trial fix dosage trial length nine week . Within nine week period study drug give dose 60 mg duloxetine . Patients randomized start medication duloxetine one week start chronotherapeutic intervention . This precaution cause distress patient ( could expect new possible side-effects chronotherapeutic intervention introduce time ) . The following chronotherapeutic intervention cover one week ( seven day ) patient admit open ward . If improve sufficiently patient discharge time point . Subsequently patient see monthly uncontrolled follow-up period end last visit 6 month inclusion study . In follow-up period start week nine , patient opportunity alter dosage study drug shift medication . The intervention follow period encourage patient keep daily time structure instruct admittance ward . Patients randomise group A treat combination duloxetine 60 mg per day 29 week chronotherapeutic intervention one week duration ( see ) . Patients randomise group B treat duloxetine dose 60 mg per day 29 week individual exercise instruct physiotherapist . Patients inform two intervention group base different time-structuring regime . The placebo condition choose secure similar expectancy rate two treatment condition . Group A. Duloxetine treatment 60 mg per day 29 week plus chronotherapeutic intervention 1 week duration . - Duloxetine dosage 60 mg daily possibility increase dosage 90 120 mg week nine patient incomplete response . - Chronotherapeutic intervention 1 . Light treatment : Light treatment give 10.000 lux 1 hour , individually time accord MEQ score . 2 . Sleep deprivation sleep phase advance : Sleep schedule show . - Day one two : Total sleep deprivation I - Day two three : 9 pm 7 . Sleep-phase-advance I - Day three four : Total sleep deprivation II - Day four five : 9 pm 7 . Sleep phase advance II - Day five six : Total sleep deprivation III - Day six seven : 9 pm 7 . Sleep phase advance III Group B. Duloxetine treatment 60 mg per day nine week plus chronotherapeutic intervention moderate time structure exercise 1 week duration . - Duloxetine dosage 60 mg daily possibility increase dosage 90 120 mg week nine patient incomplete response . From day seven , sleep regulate accord two rule : 1 . Not take naps daytime . 2 . Getting bed 8 late . Concomitant medication : Oxazepam allow severe agitation sleep disturbance ( except day sleep deprivation ) daily dos mention earlier . Psychometrics : The diagnosis major depression make Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( M.I.N.I. ) . Severity depression assess weekly rating use interview-based Hamilton Depression Rating scale ( 17 6 item version , Bech et al 2000 ) newly develop 6 item self-assessment Hamilton scale . Patients fill Global Rating Scale ( Preskorn ) daily . Side effect monitor weekly UKU scale . At baseline , Morningness Eveningness Questionnaire ( MEQ ) use calculate individual timing light . Time line : The study start September 2005 . The inclusion period 2 year data publish 6 month ' period thereafter . Efficacy measure : Primary outcome criteria response remission . Secondary outcome criterion mean weekly Hamilton rating ( 17-items 6-items version ) . Tertiary outcome criterion time discharge . Regulations : The study follow Good Clinical Practice Guidelines obtain approval local ethical committee , Danish Data Protection Agency Danish Medicines Agency . Patients sign inform consent form write oral description study . Safety : All Events , serious Events , Adverse drug reaction Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions report accord regulatory authority ' rule . Side effect monitor .</detailed_description>
