	<brief_summary>Induction chemotherapy administer every 2 week 6 cycle ( 3 month ) . Patients radiological evidence progressive disease shift salvage chemotherapy . Patients responsive stable disease induction chemotherapy receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy 3-4 week last dose induction chemotherapy . Surgical evaluation perform 4-6 week completion chemoradiotherapy . Patients resectable disease undergo surgical resection . Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy GOFL 6 cycle give curative resection . Patients still unresectable disease non-curative resection receive systemic chemotherapy GOFL till disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Induction chemotherapy administer biweekly basis . Reported adverse event potential risk gemcitabine , oxaliplatin , 5-FU leucovorin describe Section 6 . Appropriate dose modification describe Section 5 . No investigational commercial agent therapy describe may administer intent treat patient 's malignancy . 4.1.1 Treatment schedule induction chemotherapy For dose GOFL chemotherapy , intravenous infusion gemcitabine fix rate 10 mg/m2/min immediately follow 2-hour intravenous infusion oxaliplatin 48-hour intravenous infusion 5-FU leucovorin . 4.1.2 Premedication chemotherapy Patients receive 4mg dexamethasone anti-histamine appropriate anti-emetics ( serotonin antagonist ) dose chemotherapy . 4.2 Supportive Care Guidelines Prophylactic G-CSF GM-CSF routinely use study . In case febrile neutropenia , patient treat appropriate antibiotic . Therapeutic G-CSF may use discretion attend physician 4.3 Duration Induction Chemotherapy In absence treatment delay due adverse event , treatment may continue 6 cycle one follow criterion applies : C Disease progression , C Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , C Unacceptable adverse event ( ) , C Patient decide withdraw study , C General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator . 4.4 Agents Radiation Administration Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy 4.4.1 Treatment schedule concurrent chemoradiotherapy 4.4.1.1 Patient selection Patients evaluate 6 cycle induction chemotherapy . Patients progressive disease either due distant metastasis locoregional progression give salvage systemic chemotherapy enrol concurrent chemoradiotherapy . Patients achieve complete remission , partial remission stable disease enrol 2nd phase study , concurrent chemoradiotherapy , 3-4 week last dose induction chemotherapy . 4.4.2 Study Agents Gemcitabine 400mg/m2 dissolve 250ml normal saline infuse intravenously fix rate 10mg/m2/min 40 min . 4.4.1.2 Treatment schedule Gemcitabine 400mg/m2 250ml normal saline iv infuse 40mins , 2hrs RT day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Radiation give 180cGy per day , 5 day week 28 fraction totally 5040cGy . 4.4.1.3 Premedication concurrent chemoradiotherapy Patients give dexamethasone 2mg orally three time day ( tid ) morning first radiotherapy fraction . The prophylactic dexamethasone continue receive fifth radiation treatment . Therefore , depend day week patient start treatment , dexamethasone take 5 7 day . All patient issue rescue medication , prochlorperazine 10mg every 6 hour orally develop nausea vomit . If patient still nausea and/or vomit treatment dexamethasone prochlorperazine fifth day radiotherapy , ondansetron 8mg orally iv one three time per day granisetron 1mg per o iv everyday 30mins radiotherapy give . 4.4.3 Radiation 4.4.3.1 Radiation technique Radiation perform high-energy linear accelerator . Three-dimensional radiation treatment planning use case . Patients immobilized foam cradle supine position , treatment planning CT obtain . Tumor mapping perform accord treatment planning CT diagnostic CT induction chemotherapy . Treatment planning perform isocenter calculate 100 % 95 % line encompass plan target volume . The spinal cord limit 4600cGy . If one kidney receive 20Gy 90 % remain kidney exclude primary beam . Generally , three-field no-axial beam arrangement ( opposed lateral anterior-inferior oblique ) use . 4.4.3.2 Radiation volume The gross tumor volume primary tumor identifiable CT scan induction chemotherapy . The clinical target volume define gross tumor volume plus 0.5cm . The planning target volume clinical target volume plus 0.5cm daily patient set-up variation . No prophylactic nodal irradiation give . 4.4.3.3 Radiation dosage A total dose 5040cGy 28 fraction , 180cGy per fraction , one fraction per day , 5 day per week , give . 4.5 Surgery 4.5.1 Surgical evaluation Patients complete induction chemotherapy concurrent chemoradiotherapy evaluate surgical resection . If evidence distant metastasis , surgery arrange . The feasibility surgical resection evaluate qualified surgeon accord contrast-enhanced abdominal CT MRI . Laparoscope optional pre-surgical evaluation . 4.5.1.1 Resectable l No distant metastases l Clear fat plane around celiac superior mesenteric artery ( SMA ) l Patent superior mesenteric vein ( SMV ) /portal vein 4.5.1.2 Borderline resectable l Severe unilateral SMV/portal impingement l Tumor abutment SMA l Gastroduodenal artery ( GDA ) encasement origin hepatic artery l Colon mesocolon invasion l Adrenal , colon mesocolon , kidney invasion 4.5.1.3 Unresectable l Distant metastases l SMA , celiac encasement l SMV/portal occlusion l Aortic , inferior vena cava ( IVC ) invasion encasement l Invasion SMV transverse mesocolon l Rib , vertebral invasion 4.5.2 Treatment schedule surgery Surgery perform within 4-6 week chemoradiotherapy complete . 4.5.3 Surgical technique Patients whose tumor consider resectable undergo laparotomy . If complete surgical resection feasible , optimal surgery perform . If complete surgical resection impossible , biopsy without palliative surgery ( eg . bypass surgery ) may perform . 4.6 Adjuvant/Maintenance Chemotherapy 4.6.1 Treatment schedule Patients curative surgical resection receive 6 cycle adjuvant GOFL chemotherapy within 4 week surgery follow tumor progression . Patients feasible curative resection , receive continue chemotherapy GOFL 3-4 week chemoradiotherapy complete . The regimen continue till disease progression . Patients develop progressive disease GOFL shift salvage chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
