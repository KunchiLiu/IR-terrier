	<brief_summary>The VIAMI-trial investigates effect balloon angioplasty stenting infarct-vessel early phase acute myocardial infarction . The study concern patient residual viable tissue infarct-area treat thrombolysis . It postulate patient remain viable tissue high-risk recurrent infarction anginal attack stenting infarct-vessel reduce risk considerably .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Viability-Guided Angioplasty After Acute Myocardial Infarction-Trial ( The VIAMI-Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Earlier study show routine angioplasty infarct-related coronary artery soon thrombolysis acute myocardial infarction result clinical benefit . This finding emphasize importance select subgroup patient recent myocardial infarction , really benefit angioplasty infarct-related artery . Several study demonstrate presence viability infarct-area early acute myocardial infarction imposes increase risk new cardiac event like recurrent infarction , angina pectoris need coronary intervention . Therefore , postulate patient viability infarct-area benefit angioplasty early acute myocardial infarction . In VIAMI-trial patient admit hospital acute myocardial infarction undergo immediate coronary angioplasty , undergo viability test dobutamine-echocardiography within 3 day admission . Patients unequivocal sign viability infarct-area randomized invasive conservative treatment strategy . In invasive strategy patient undergo coronary angiography intention perform balloon angioplasty stenting infarct-related coronary artery , concomitant use intravenous platelet inhibitor abciximab . In conservative group patient undergo coronary angiography angioplasty new impend infarction recurrent ischemia present . In invasive group balloon angioplasty perform soon possible randomization . Patients without viability randomize , participate control group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Admission within 6 hour pain onset EKG ≥ 1 mm STsegment elevation two standard lead ≥ 2 mm STelevation two contiguous chest lead , indicative transmural ischemia , without development new Qwaves , myocardial necrosis proven enzyme rise ( total CPK ≥ 2x upper normal limit ) . Patient history compatible subacute myocardial infarction ( ≥ 6 hour ) , least sign myocardial necrosis EKG ( Qwaves ) significantly increase serum level cardiacspecific enzyme . Age 18 80 year . Viability test perform prior coronary angiography . No clinical indication invasive procedure perform viability test No informed consent obtain Unreliable followup Viability test technically possible Contraindications dobutamine echocardiography ( heart failure , arrhythmia ) Contraindications coronary angiography , severe diabetic nephropathy know contrastallergy Known hypersensitivity abciximab Serious , lifethreatening noncardiac illness</criteria>
