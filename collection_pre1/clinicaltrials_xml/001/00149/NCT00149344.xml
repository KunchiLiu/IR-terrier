	<brief_summary>Main research question : Is vertical scar reduction mammoplasty superior compare inferior pedicle reduction mammoplasty term patient quality life cost-effectiveness ? Why research important ? : There on-going controversy among plastic surgeon superiority one technique ( vertical scar mammoplasty versus inferior pedicle reduction mammoplasty ) term patient health relate quality life health care resource utilization . What study ? : We study ( compare ) two surgical procedure breast reduction mammoplasty ( vertical scar mammoplasty versus inferior pedicle reduction mammoplasty ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vertical Scar Versus Inferior Pedicle Reduction Mammoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast reduction one common procedure perform plastic surgeon . Because common jurisdiction require least one day hospital stay , consume considerable health care resource . Although multiple technique report , two top compete technique use North America inferior pedicle technique vertical scar technique . There on-going controversy superiority one technique term patient satisfaction health care resource utilization . In last year , third party payer concerned unnecessary consumption scarce health care resource due variation practice mostly influence surgeon preference rather valid evidence . The purpose study test hypothesis Vertical Scar Reduction Mammoplasty ( VSR ) superior Inferior Pedicle Reduction Mammoplasty ( IPR ) term patient health-related quality life ( HRQL ) . Health related quality life measure Health Utilities Index Mark 2/3 ( HUI ) provide outcome , quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) Breast Reduction Assessment Value Outcomes ( BRAVO ) instrument . The BRAVO instrument consist set separate instrument include Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) , Multidimensional Body Self Relations Questionnaire Appearance Assessment ( MBSRQ-AS ) , Breast Related Symptoms Questionnaire ( BRSQ ) . The MBSRQ-AS provide measure self-evaluation appearance , BRSQ measure breast symptom score . Secondly , test whether VSR cost-effective procedure . If hypothesis confirm VSR technique cost-effective , compelling evidence adopt . Regardless whether VSR find cost-effective , plastic surgery community , third party payer , patient inform result .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients suffer breast hypertrophy Patients receive OHIP approval reduction mammoplasty Candidate surgical procedure Patient willing complete quality life questionnaire follow Patient provide inform consent Unilateral Breast Hypertrophy Patients age 18 year Inability complete questionnaire due language problem Bilateral mastopexy ( breast lift ) Previous breast reduction surgery Patients require great 1000 gram remove either breast ( assessed Archimedes principle* preoperatively ; patient Archimedes principle displace 1400 cc volume exclude study ) Preoperative radiation lumpectomy If another procedure `` piggy back ' reduction mammoplasty ( e.g . liposuction breast elsewhere , abdominoplasty , etc ) The Archimedes principle follow : In privacy bathroom patient immerse breast separately large pot fill brim tap water . The breast displace water collect another large container e.g . plastic dish pan place underneath pot . The patient ask measure volume displace water ml . The volume displace approximate weight breast . The measurement do 3 time average breast record . ( The surgeon explain principle patient uncertainty whether resection exceed 1000 gram . For rest patient necessary . )</criteria>
