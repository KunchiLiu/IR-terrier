	<brief_title>Magnetic Brain Stimulation Treatment Adult Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression type depression interfere ability work , study , sleep , eat , enjoy pleasurable activity . Because people often develop resistance medication use treat depression , new treatment need . Decreased electrical activity prefrontal region brain link symptoms depression . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) use influence brain 's electrical activity . This procedure entail attach electrode head use device pas magnetic energy coil brain . rTMS show antidepressant effect depressed individual . However , optimal level intensity treatment duration yet determine . This study ass safety effectiveness rTMS prefrontal region brain depress adult moderate treatment resistance . The treatment phase double-blind study last minimum 32 week consist 3 phase . In Phase I , participant randomly assign receive either rTMS sham stimulation . The sham stimulation mimic sensation rTMS induce intracerebral current . Treatments administer daily 3 week . Participants show sign improvement may continue Phase I 3 additional week . In Phase II , participant unresponsive Phase I treatment receive daily rTMS lower dose 3 week . Participants show sign improvement , achieve remission , may continue Phase II 4 additional week . Baseline magnetic resonance image use determine optimal stimulus intensity adjust individual difference cortical skull distance . Phase III participant achieve remission first 2 phase . These participant receive antidepressant medication treatment daily six month . Participants ' functional status symptom depression measure use self-report scale video-recorded interview study start date end treatment phase .</detailed_description>
