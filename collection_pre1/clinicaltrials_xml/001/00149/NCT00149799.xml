	<brief_title>Effectiveness Escitalopram Treatment Body Dysmorphic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct first pharmacotherapy relapse prevention study body dysmorphic disorder ( BDD ) . BDD , often-delusional preoccupation nonexistent slight defect appearance , distress , impairing , common body image disorder . It associate high rate functional impairment markedly poor quality life . It appear serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SRIs ) often -- selectively -- efficacious BDD many BDD patient receive SRIs . It also appear patient discontinue efficacious SRI point , alternative life-long treatment . However , relapse prevention study do . Such study important clinical public health perspective , BDD appear often chronic require long-term treatment . It therefore critically important investigate risk relapse SRI discontinuation , whether continuation SRI treatment decrease relapse risk . Subjects enrol first treat openly 14 week escitalopram ; 58 escitalopram responder randomize double-blind continuation treatment escitalopram placebo 6 additional month . Our primary aim compare time relapse relapse rate responder acute escitalopram randomize placebo versus continuation treatment escitalopram . Secondary/exploratory aim explore 1 ) Whether subject receive continuation escitalopram perform well secondary outcome measure ( e.g. , quality life ) placebo ; 2 ) Change symptom continuation escitalopram continuation phase ; 3 ) Acute treatment response . In summary , study first relapse prevention study BDD first study continuation pharmacotherapy BDD . It provide critically important information relapse continuation versus discontinuation SRI , whether continuation treatment protect relapse , change symptom continuation treatment . This study yield unique clinically important data , fill gap knowledge common , severe , understudied illness .</detailed_description>
