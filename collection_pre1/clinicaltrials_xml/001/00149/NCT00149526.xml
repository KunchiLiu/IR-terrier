	<brief_title>Does Shared Decision-Making Improve Asthma Outcomes ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although much know asthma , effective asthma treatment , half patient persistent asthma adhere prescribe long-term controller medication . One way change might involve patient decision treatment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Overview study design This study design evaluate effectiveness model share decision-making improving outcome adult age 18-70 year suboptimally control , mild-moderate persistent asthma . The share decision-making model ( SD ) compare randomize control trial model base national asthma guideline ( MG ) , usual care ( UC ) . Initially , adapt model share decision-making use successfully cancer make appropriate chronic disease ( asthma ) . We also adapt KP Asthma Guidelines two model ( Management Guidelines Shared Decision-Making ) take similar amount clinician-patient interaction time . We compare two model usual care primary care set Kaiser Permanente Northwest Kaiser Permanente Hawaii randomize control trial 24-month follow . The individual asthma patient unit randomization . Interventions do care manager ( nurse practitioner clinical pharmacist ) experience asthma , authority change medication regimen . Different staff use two intervention group minimize contamination group attributable intervention . Eligible participant randomize three group ( UC , MG , SD ) equal 1:1:1 basis , stratify prior health care utilization within center ( KPNW KPH ) . All study participant follow 24 month clinic visit data collection 12 month . The MG SD arm receive interim phone call care manager three , six , nine month assess problem treatment regimen , discus change may desire treatment regimen , encourage adherence . Different staff responsible data collection intervention . We compare MG SD model versus usual care ( UC v MG ; UC v SD ) , MG SD model ( MG v SD ) . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
