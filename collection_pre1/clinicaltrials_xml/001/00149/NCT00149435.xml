	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) Events Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) NHLBI-funded cohort study risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) stroke adult 65 year old . In early 1990s , 5888 participant underwent examination include traditional risk factor measure sub-clinical disease . During follow-up , many exam component repeat , CVD event ascertain . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute extend CHS contract funding ( 1 ) implement model transition contract-funding investigator-initiated research ( 2 ) enhance access CHS data future paper ancillary study CHS non-CHS colleague . The Events Follow-up Study provide foundation transition . Current future paper ancillary study use CHS data store specimen additional power conduct efficiently service events-core continue collect adjudicate CVD event death standardize fashion . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Structurally , primary aim : ( 1 ) evaluate incidence rate risk factor CVD old adult , include comparison black white , men woman , young old old ; ( 2 ) evaluation prognosis inception cohort old adult new-onset condition heart failure ( HF ) atrial fibrillation ; ( 3 ) evaluation association risk-factor change incidence subsequent event . Questions interest include : What determinants low CHD incidence woman 80 yr old ? Do old black woman also low CHD incidence ? What determinants CHD , HF , stroke adult 80 old ? Are risk factor different men woman , white black ? Do traditional risk factor measure sub-clinical disease continue powerful predictor CHD , HF stroke 80 old ? In study , investigator expect make 20,000 phone call identify 6000 hospitalization , 1000 death , 3000 event detailed review , 1500 new event , include 370 CHD , 300 stroke , 450 HF . These new event represent increase number CVD event 29 % 35 % white increase 40 % 49 % black . The data specimen collect CHS represent major national resource study health , age , cardiovascular disease old adult . Additional event follow-up provide opportunity address aim study , also enhance power current future CHS paper ancillary study CHS non-CHS colleague .</detailed_description>
