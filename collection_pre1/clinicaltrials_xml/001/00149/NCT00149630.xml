	<brief_summary>Previous research show disulfiram , medication sometimes use treat alcoholism , discourage cocaine use among cocaine addict undergo methadone treatment . By block enzyme dopamine beta hydroxylase ( DBH ) , disulfiram increase level dopamine produce unpleasant sense hyperstimulation discomfort cocaine user . This study evaluate effectiveness disulfiram prevent drug relapse among cocaine opiate addict vary inherited level DBH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dopamine , type neurotransmitter , brain 's `` feel good '' chemical . The amount dopamine body may important factor cocaine addict respond treatment . Disulfiram , like cocaine , enhance dopamine activity . Upon take disulfiram , subsequent intake cocaine may elevate dopamine excessive level produce extreme discomfort . DBH enzyme break dopamine . A particular variation DBH gene affect amount dopamine release body . Therefore , cocaine addict vary DBH gene may respond differently treatment . The purpose study compare effectiveness disulfiram prevent relapse among methadone-maintained individual addict cocaine opioids may different DBH gene . This 17-week study begin 2-week methadone stabilization period . Participants randomly assign receive daily dose either 250 mg disulfiram placebo 12 week , concurrently receive methadone treatment . All participant stop receive study medication Week 14 , point undergo 4-week methadone detoxification period . Participants report cocaine drug use , well cocaine craving experience . Cocaine level monitor throughout study urine test . The DBH gene participant examine determine specific make-up particular variation .</detailed_description>
