	<brief_summary>This Phase II pilot study chemotherapy surgery child advance stage high-risk neuroblastoma utilizing topotecan upfront window active agent induction intensification phase . The primary purpose estimate response rate upfront window two cycle intravenous topotecan . We hypothesize topotecan window effective therapy term response rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In prospective phase II trial , topotecan administer intravenously daily 5 day 2 consecutive week two cycle upfront treatment window . Patients subsequently receive standard treatment induction intensification phase . The objective trial : - To estimate response rate upfront window two cycle IV topotecan give dos adjust attain targeted systemic exposure child advance stage neuroblastoma . - To determine feasibility toxicity intensification phase high-dose chemotherapy topotecan cyclophosphamide follow autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant - To estimate 3-year overall survival progression-free survival patient treat approach - To characterize phenotype neuroblastoma tumor cell - To evaluate disposition topotecan previously untreated patient neuroblastoma Details chemotherapy intervention : Window Phase Topotecan description , window therapy-Topotecan give intravenously daily 30 minute infusion five consecutive day , two day , five consecutive day . The dose day 1 2 3.0 mg/m2 subsequent dos adjust attain target systemic exposure . A second course Topotecan give approximately 16 day end first cycle , initial dose second course Topotecan base dose require preceding course attain target AUC . Induction Phase Cyclophosphamide , MESNA , Adriamycin , Cisplatin , Carboplatin , Etoposide description , Induction Phase ( completion window ) consist 4 cycle therapy : Cycle 1 : Cyclophosphamide 1 gm/m2 daily x 2 I.V . day 1 2 Adriamycin 35 mg/m2 I.V . day 1 , MESNA : 250 mg/m2 I.V . immediately follow cyclophosphamide infusion 3 6 hour post-infusion , Etoposide : 30 mg/m2 30 minute , follow 250 mg/m2/day x 3 day I.V . continuous infusion ( day 2-5 ) Cycles 2 4- Cisplatin 40 mg/m2/day x 5 I.V . 1 hour ( day 1-5 ) Etoposide 200 mg/m2/day x 3 I.V . 1 hour ( day 2,3,4 ) Cycle 3 : Carboplatin : dose adapt GFR day 1 . Dose mg/m2 = 8 x [ ( 0.93 GFR ) + 15 ] Ifosfamide : 2 gm/m2 I.V . 1 hour daily x 3 ( day 2 , 3 , 4 ) MESNA : 500 mg/m2 I.V . immediately ifosfamide 3 6 hour later Etoposide : 100 mg/m2 IV daily x 3 1 hour ( day 2 , 3 , 4 ) . Intensification Phase Topotecan , Cyclophosphamide , MESNA- Intensification Therapy : Topotecan - target dose - daily x 5 day two week . Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV 1 hour day 8 12 . MESNA 175 mg/m2 IV immediately cyclophosphamide 3 6 hour later . Infusion previously collect peripheral blood stem cell day 14 . Subjects respond Topotecan window receive topotecan intensification , instead receive follow intensification therapy : Carboplatin 700 mg/m2/day IV , one hour q.o.d . x 3 Etoposide 500 mg/m2/day IV , 6 hour q.o.d . x 3 . Infusion previously collect peripheral blood stem cell day 8 Details Intervention : Procedure/Surgery : Surgery Surgical resection perform window therapy feasible subject . If surgery possible Topotecan window resection primary tumor mass careful lymph node stag do recovery induction re-evaluation tumor status .</detailed_description>
