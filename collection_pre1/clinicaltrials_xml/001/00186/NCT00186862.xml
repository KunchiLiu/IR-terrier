	<brief_summary>Neuroblastoma affect approximately 500 child year United States . When tumor occur infant , frequently localize responds well therapy . Even disseminate disease eradicate 75 % infant , indeed may undergo spontaneous remission . In old child , prognosis far bad , 80 % disseminated tumor expect relapse within 3 year . This study utilize concept exploit immune system eradicate neuroblastoma . In tumor consistent expression tumor specific antigen part malignant process , may possible generate immune T-cells ex-vivo in-vivo use specific protein peptide ( ) derive therefrom eradicate tumor . This study evaluate use four eight injection IL-2 gene-transduced autologous neuroblastoma cell induce local , polyclonal T-cell infiltrate well anti-tumor immune response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary objective protocol include following : - To determine whether major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) restrict unrestricted antitumor immune response induce injection modify allogeneic neuroblast cell dos require produce effect . - To obtain preliminary data antitumor effect treatment regimen .</detailed_description>
