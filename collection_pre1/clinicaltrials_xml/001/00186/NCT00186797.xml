	<brief_summary>This study patient Severe Aplastic Anemia ( SAA ) . A stem cell transplant genetically match sibling donor help cure disease 85 100 percent patient . Stem cell immature blood cell grow become red blood cell , white blood cell platelet . A genetic `` match '' mean brother sister immune type ( HLA type ) patient . Unfortunately , patient match sibling donor . The chance negative outcomes much high type donor . This study test success new approach stem cell transplant SAA . Patients study receive drug radiation treatment destroy diseased bone marrow prepare stem cell transplant . Bone marrow tissue inside bone stem cell made.Stem cell harvest blood bone marrow genetically match unrelated donor partially match family donor . The stem cell filter use new device currently study . The patient receive large dos filter stem cell ( stem cell graft ) . Researchers want find study treatment affect patient , disease , chance survival .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &lt; 21 year Diagnosis severe aplastic anemia . ( As define least 2 follow : ANC &lt; 500/μl , platelet count &lt; 20,000/μl , reticulocyte count &lt; 1 % correction hematocrit . In addition , diagnostic bone marrow biopsy must contain less 25 % normal cellularity ) . Patient must fail one course immunosuppressive therapy include ATG . As immunosuppression may take 6 month demonstrate response , patient must observe failed immunosuppression minimum six month . Absence suitable HLAmatched sibling donor . Negative serum pregnancy test females child bear potential . Patient/parent/guardian able provide inform consent . Patients life expectancy &lt; 6 week . Patients severe renal disease ( creatinine clearance &lt; 40cc/min/1.73m2 ) Patients preexist severe restrictive pulmonary disease ( FVC &lt; 40 % predict )</criteria>
