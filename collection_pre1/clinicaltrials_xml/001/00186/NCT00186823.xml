	<brief_summary>Blood marrow stem cell transplant improve outcome patient high-risk hematologic malignancy . However , patient appropriate HLA ( immune type ) match sibling donor available and/or unable identify acceptable unrelated HLA match donor registry timely manner . Another option haploidentical transplant use partially match family member donor . Although haploidentical transplant proven curative many patient , procedure hinder significant complication , primarily regimen-related toxicity include graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) infection due delay immune reconstitution . These , part , due certain white blood cell graft call T cell . GVHD happen donor T cell recognize body tissue patient ( host ) different attack cell . Although many T cell increase possibility GVHD , may cause recipient 's immune system reconstitute slowly graft fail grow , leave patient high-risk significant infection . This research project investigate use particular pre-transplant conditioning regimen ( chemotherapy , antibody total body irradiation ) follow stem cell infusion `` mismatch '' family member donor . Once stem cell obtain highly purified effort remove T cell use investigational CliniMACS stem cell selection device . The primary goal study determine rate neutrophil platelet engraftment , well degree rate immune reconstitution first 100 day posttransplant patient receive study treatment . Researchers also study way decrease complication may occur transplant genetically mismatch family donor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary outcome evaluation clinical study include follow : - To estimate overall survival , disease free survival event free survival patient - To estimate incidence grade 2 4 acute GvHD patient - To estimate incidence chronic GvHD graft failure patient - To estimate incidence non-hematologic peri-transplant regimen-related toxicity regimen-related mortality first 100 day transplantation patient - To estimate number patient require donor lymphocyte infusion and/or stem cell boost transplantation group patient evaluate impact immune reconstitution engraftment - To estimate number patient develop evidence EBV reactivation post transplant lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLPD ) post transplant group patient - Describe pharmacokinetics rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin ( rATG ) patient receive allogeneic transplantation determine frequency rATG antibody development - Explore dose patient characteristic determinant active rATG pharmacokinetic parameter Originally study begin randomize comparison two method stem cell selection utilize CliniMACS device . Both arm provide purified product CD34+ hematopoietic cell deplete T-lymphocytes . One arm utilize positive selection methodology use anti-CD34 antibody arm utilized negative selection anti-CD3 antibody OKT-3 . There toxicity note would require study interrupt early , however , due low accrual , decide redesign study . The new design focus standard arm utilizing negative selection , subsequent participant treat manner . The patient treat positive selection arm continue monitor specify original protocol , report descriptive manner . The primary secondary objective current version study answer patient receive haploidentical stem cell transplant utilize negative selection methodology .</detailed_description>
