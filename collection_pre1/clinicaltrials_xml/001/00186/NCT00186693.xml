	<detailed_description>Airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) characteristic feature asthmatic condition human . There association AHR eosinophilic airway inflammation . However , even though eosinophilic inflammation abolish appropriate therapy , typical AHR improve modestly treatment . The determinant AHR poorly understood . Recent data implicate mediator cytokine Interleukin-13 ( IL-13 ) , structural change airway wall ( remodel ) , increased contractility airway smooth muscle cell ( ASMC ) loss mechanical connection tether , potential factor contribute AHR . There also uncertainty around site airway narrowing asthma . In normal airway , bronchii around 4th order great contribution total resistance . It hypothesize site great resistance move distally asthma might even involve quite small airway close level terminal bronchiole . Non-invasive method assess airway caliber vivo still unproven . One untested concern airways subject severe AHR potential close completely put risk severe even fatal airflow obstruction . We propose study AHR human asthma : determine relationship AHR ( ) eosinophilic inflammation airway ( sputum cellularity ) via sputum induction , ( ii ) soluble mediator inflammation ( IL-13 , IL-4 , IL-5 ) , ( iii ) remodel airway wall ( sub-epithelial fibrosis , ASMC accumulation ) via biopsy . In addition compare measurement AHR assess inhalation challenge result direct , local installation methacholine . At bronchoscopy , methacholine deliver airway bronchoconstriction assess directly . This method allow study proximal distal airway , identification heterogeneity responses among airways extent human airways constrict vivo .</detailed_description>
