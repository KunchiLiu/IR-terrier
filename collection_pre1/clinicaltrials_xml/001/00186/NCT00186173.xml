	<brief_title>Sports Prevent Obesity : Feasibility Pilot RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After school sport program may generalizable , motivate cost-efficient intervention long-term weight control among at-risk overweight child . The infrastructure need provide program already exist community . In contrast , traditional , medically- behaviorally-oriented treatment program expensive , generally effective , often inconvenient , available community . While child involve team sport tend physically fit uninvolved peer , team sport yet test method increase involvement at-risk overweight child regular physical activity . As added bonus , sport program displace typical school television view snack . Team sport potentially innovative high impact approach intervene at-risk overweight child , may provide opportunity reduce weight gain increase social interaction self-esteem . If propose research find team sport efficacious intervention reduce weight gain among low-income at-risk overweight child , intervention approach could rapidly diffuse test effectiveness . The policy implication finding would great , encourage expanded access team sport program population previously target include . We propose two-phase project East Palo Alto , California , low-income , primarily Latino , African-American Pacific Islander community . The first phase 3-month feasibility trial school team sport program overweight child examine several theory-driven approach program design implementation , include assessment like participation barrier facilitator participation . The second phase 6-month randomize control pilot trial ( RCT ) compare weight change among overweight child randomize participate school team sport program versus traditional weight control/health education program .</detailed_description>
