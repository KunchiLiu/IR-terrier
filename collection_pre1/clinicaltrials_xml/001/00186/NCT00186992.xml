	<brief_summary>Researchers St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital look effective way deliver radiation therapy pediatric tumor bone soft tissue . The goal study improve local control musculoskeletal tumor image-guided radiation therapy ( IGRT ) minimize radiation relate side effect . IGRT use compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) image precisely define tumor location carefully plan radiation treatment . This approach allow doctor deliver highly conformal radiation therapy tumor protect nearby healthy normal tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study focus follow primary Objectives : - To estimate local control rate image guide radiation therapy define study patient primary musculoskeletal tumor ( MST ) . - Prospectively establish baseline estimate local control patient MST ( Ewing 's sarcoma family tumor ( ESFT ) , rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) ) treat image guide radiation therapy . - Demonstrate increase level conformality afford image guide radiation therapy reduce efficacy relative previously utilized non-image guide radiation therapy techniques patient Ewing 's sarcoma family tumor , resect soft tissue sarcoma , group III rhabdomyosarcoma . - Assess local regional pattern failure patient MST treat image guide radiation therapy relative target volume . - Provide long term ( &gt; 5 year ) estimate local disease control patient MST ( Ewing 's sarcoma family tumor ( ESFT ) ) , rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) , non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) treat image guide radiation therapy . The study focus follow secondary objective : - Establish quantitative baseline estimate radiation dose-related change normal tissue use novel objective measure somatic change , musculoskeletal function , tissue biochemistry physiology . Investigate dose volume relationship develop physis cortical bone use physical measure image evaluation include : - Prospectively investigate whether age base radiotherapeutic threshold dose volume induce premature physis closure alter long bone length quantitatively identify . - Quantitatively explore impact radiation cortical bone thin long bone curvature . - Relate radiation dose volume late ( 10+ year ) alterations bone integrity . - Describe severity time course radiation-induced change soft tissue include muscle . - Delineate sequential change muscular volume , muscle function organ function ( delineated imaging measure physical function ) follow image guide radiation specific muscular group . - Correlate temporal change muscular volume function change vascularity metabolism define imaging study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age le equal 25 year ( new enrollment ) . No age limit participant reconsent reenroll . Musculoskeletal tumor involve primary site origin require definitive , preoperative postoperative irradiation primary site . No prior therapeutic irradiation primary site except emergent radiation primary site last 1 week less ( 5 treatment day ) dosimetrically account analysis . Negative serum urine betaHCG female child bear age . Patients stratify 2 group evaluation secondary objective endpoint base absence presence metastatic disease . Patients may enter study specific clinical situation often define multimodality protocol include use radiation therapy , include irradiation alone combine surgery ( follow surgical resection may macroscopically complete incomplete , positive negative histologic margin ) and/or chemotherapy ( follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy combine postirradiation adjuvant chemotherapy ) .Patients require regional nodal irradiation and/or metastatic site irradiation allow long primary site require radiation.Patients recurrent tumor second malignant neoplasm allow study current primary tumor site require irradiation previously irradiate . The treatment plan detail study allow patient concurrently enrol institutional COG study . Patients enrol prior amendment 4.0 , still active participation reconsented current version protocol ( 5.0 ) .</criteria>
