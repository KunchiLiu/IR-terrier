	<brief_summary>A breathing condition know `` chronic obstructive pulmonary disease '' ( COPD ) cause cigarette smoke major health problem . The way smoking lead lung disease uncertain . Recent research do animal provide description specific change ( reduction ) immune cell type result cigarette smoke exposure . The study ask participate pilot study see similar change occur human smoke . The purpose study evaluate new method test blood 3 group 10 people : normal non-smoking subject , subject smoke history lung disease subject smoke smoking relate COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>How Smoking Causes COPD : Examination Immune System Changes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanism smoke lead damage lung tissue susceptible host , uncertain . Recently description specific change ( reduction ) number activity certain key immune cell type - dendritic cells- result cigarette smoke exposure . This work do animal model would like develop method allow u examine similar change occur human smoke . Reduced number activity dendritic cell would expect lead increase incidence infection - common problem patient COPD . Since dendritic cell come lung bloodstream , one detect circulation , look dendritic cell present peripheral blood .</detailed_description>
