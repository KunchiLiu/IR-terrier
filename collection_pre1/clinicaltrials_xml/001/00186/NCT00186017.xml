	<brief_summary>We assess effect olanzapine compare placebo add prior treatment CGI-S one-week randomize double-blind study . We also assess effect olanzapine add prior treatment CGI-S eight-week open treatment study . In addition , assess effect olanzapine Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) , Hamilton Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scales ( HDRS , MADRS ) , Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scales ( HARS ) paradigm . We also assess influence presentation severity ( CGI-S ) polarity ( mood elevation versus depression ) olanzapine response . Finally , assess safety tolerability olanzapine paradigm . We hypothesize diverse mild syndromal subsyndromal exacerbation BD outpatient , randomize double-blind flexibly dose olanzapine add prior treatment ( include treatment ) yield great CGI-S improvement placebo end one week , improvement persist one week open continuation treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Development market new therapy bipolar disorder ( BD ) typically entail perform double-blind placebo-controlled trial acute mania 1 , 2 , maintenance study 3 , 4 , recently acute depression study 5 . Such approach address BD primarily term episodes strength studying level pathology sufficiently high permit detection treatment effect , guide clinician encounter syndromal mood episode . However , approach important limitation address important unmet clinical need , namely management subsyndromal symptom . Indeed , emerge data suggest BD subsyndromal symptom compare syndromal episode far pervasive 6 , 7 . Also approach run risk pay sufficient attention disorder construct , sense permit preoccupation syndromal episode carry importance disorder . Our group publish novel open study olanzapine diverse exacerbation BD 8 . Twenty-five bipolar disorder [ 14 bipolar I ( BPI ) , 10 bipolar II ( BPII ) one bipolar disorder otherwise specify ( BP NOS ) ] outpatient receive open olanzapine ( 15 adjunctive , 10 monotherapy ) . Thirteen elevate ( 11 syndromal , two subsyndromal ) 12 depress ( four syndromal , eight subsyndromal ) mood symptom least mild severity , Clinical Global Impression-Severity ( CGI-S ) score least 3 . Only one psychotic symptom . With open olanzapine ( 15 adjunctive , 10 monotherapy ) , overall symptom severity ( CGI-S ) well mood elevation ( Young Mania Rating Scale ) , depression ( Hamilton Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scales ) , anxiety ( Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ) , rapidly decrease ( significantly day 2-3 ) . Patients great baseline severity ( CGI-S ) great improvement . Fifteen 25 ( 60 % ) patient respond . Time consistent response bimodal , five early ( 0.5 +/- 0.3 week ) 10 late ( 7.0 +/- 1.9 week ) responder . Early compare late responder 51 % low final olanzapine dos . Olanzapine generally well tolerate , sedation weight gain common adverse effect . Thus , olanzapine appear effective diverse exacerbation BD outpatient . Controlled study warrant explore preliminary observation .</detailed_description>
