	<brief_summary>Approximately 1/4 US population insulin resistance associate risk factor elevate lipid level -triglycerides ( type fat eat liver produce low HDL cholesterol good cholesterol help protect heart disease . Currently one know treatment medication call fenofibrate , another medication improve insulin resistance rosiglitazone , third treatment know improve insulin resistance decrease triglyceride weight loss . In study insulin resistant individual elevate triglyceride ratio triglyceride HDL cholesterol 3:1 great randomize ( select chance ) receive one treatment result insulin sensitivity cardiac risk profile compare end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It estimate approximately Â¼ US population Insulin Resistant Syndrome ( IRS ) . The notion insulin resistance compensatory hyperinsulinemia lead cluster abnormality increase CVD risk first introduced 1988 , central change identify dyslipidemia characterize high plasma triglyceride ( TG ) low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) concentration . The atherogenic lipoprotein pattern associate IRS grown include enhanced postprandial lipemia small denser low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) particle . In addition associate insulin resistance compensatory hyperinsulinemia , change lipoprotein metabolism identify increase CVD risk . The power dyslipidemia associate IRS reinforce report plasma TG/HDL-C concentration ratio powerful predictor CVD , , conventional total plasma cholesterol/LDL-C concentration ratio , evidence Copenhagen Male Study interaction plasma TG HDL-C concentration , `` conventional '' CVD risk factor , CVD event . Specifically , latter investigator able show prospective study ( 11 ) CVD event substantially attenuate : 1 ) smoker ; 2 ) patient high blood pressure ; 3 ) individual high LDL-C concentration ; 4 ) subject sedentary ; long low 1/3rd population low TG/HDL-C concentration ratio presumably insulin sensitive . Conversely , tertile high plasma TG/HDL-C concentration ratio , presumably insulin resistant , significant increase CVD event absence four conventional CVD risk factor evaluate . An obvious alternative therapeutic approach decrease CVD risk patient IRS would administer thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) compound effort directly treat basic defect syndrome . However , base upon result rosiglitazone ( ROSI ) several different patient population , improvement insulin sensitivity associate significant improvement dyslipidemia . For example , recent study ( unpublished ) ROSI-treated patient type 2 diabetes , neither plasma TG ( 358 347 mg/dL ) HDL-C ( 40 42 mg/dL ) concentration improve , total ( 215 239 mg/dL LDL-C ( 118-142mg/dL ) concentration actually increase . Since patient study become insulin sensitive treatment , low daylong plasma glucose , insulin , free fatty acid concentration , reason lack beneficial effect ROSI lipoprotein metabolism clear . On hand , give evidence importance dyslipidemia increase CVD risk insulin resistant individual , seem reasonable question notion TZD compound provide beneficial approach decrease CVD risk dyslipidemic patient IRS . With background mind , propose initiate study insulin resistant individual dyslipidemia characteristic IRS randomize treatment fenofibrate , ROSI , weight loss effect three treatment CVD risk factor compare . It postulate although insulin resistance improve great degree ROSI treatment , atherogenic lipoprotein profile know link IRS CVD significantly improve follow treatment fenofibrate effect weight loss effect .</detailed_description>
