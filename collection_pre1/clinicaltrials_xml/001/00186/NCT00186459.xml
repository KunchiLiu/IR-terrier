	<brief_summary>The goal study define role play resistance insulin-mediated glucose disposal ( insulin resistance ) circulate plasma insulin concentration : 1 ) ability lose weight ; 2 ) reduction risk coronary heart disease result weight loss . We hypothesize set caloric restriction , manipulate endogenous insulin concentration alter ability subject lose weight , lead different reduction CHD risk factor . To test hypothesis , two parallel stud perform . First , obese insulin-resistant individual randomize one two equally-hypocaloric diet vary moderately proportion carbohydrate mono/polyunsaturated fat ( low carbohydrate diet associate great reduction endogenous insulin secretion ) . Second , diabetic treat insulin secretagogues compare diabetic treat insulin sensitizer respect outcome ( secretagogues increase insulin secretion insulin sensitizer decrease insulin concentration ) . Endpoints include weight loss , change insulin resistance , blood pressure , lipid lipoprotein , marker endothelial function , daylong insulin glucose concentration : compare , parallel study , group insulin-stimulating intervention v group insulin-sparing intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While obesity , insulin resistance , diabetes highly associate , clear whether insulin resistance compensatory hyperinsulinemia play important role tendency gain weight and/or inability lose weight . The role hyperinsulinemia coronary heart disease ( CHD ) also unclear . The specific aim propose research follow : 1 . To compare insulin resistant versus insulin sensitive nondiabetic overweight individual respect ability lose weight low calorie diet . CHD risk factor weight loss also assess determine degree insulin resistance associate CHD risk , well impact difference insulin resistance metabolic benefit weight loss 2 . To determine weight loss associate metabolic benefit vary function relative amount dietary fat carbohydrate hypocaloric diet . Because high carbohydrate diet increase insulin secretion , relationship dietary composition change circulate insulin concentration analyze respect weight loss CHD risk factor . 3 . To quantify compare improvement glycemic control CHD risk factor associate weight loss obese type 2 diabetic , treat 1 ) insulin secretagogue ( sulfonylurea ) 2 ) insulin sensitizer ( thiazolidinedione ) . Manipulation plasma insulin concentration medication provide mechanism evaluate impact circulate insulin concentration describe outcome measure . 4 . A subgroup overweight/obese premenopausal woman PCOS study use two diet crossover design regard macronutrient effect endogenous hyperinsulinism . For subgroup age range 18-50 year , BMI 25-50 kg/m2 . 5 . In order increase data therefore increase good understand fat cell insulin resistance change fat cell weight loss would like increase participant enrollment 550 enrolled Stanford University Medical Center recruit Bariatric participant : Age Bariatric patient 30-65 men woman BMI 27-no upper limit Currently complete participant except bariatric post bariatric population hypoglycemia follow bariatric surgery . The ethnic background subject reflect Stanford 's patient population .</detailed_description>
