	<brief_title>Memantine Adjunctive Agent Reduce Neurocognitive Deficits Following Unilateral ECT Treatment Severe Major Depressive Episode</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine whether novel NMDA antagonist memantine , FDA approve use moderate severe alzheimers dementia , may reduce neurocognitive deficit associate right unilateral ECT treatment patient receive ECT severe relatively refractory Major Depressive episode . Our hypothesis use NMDA antagonist would reduce intracellular calcium level , glutamatergic stimulation ECT . This reduction excitatory stimulation ECT would reduce hippocampal prefrontal neuronal endangerment dysfunction , thereby reduce cognitive impairment associate right unilateral ECT treatment . We also hypothesize ACTH cortisol level correlate neurocognitive impairment placebo treat subject , memantine treat individual .</detailed_description>
