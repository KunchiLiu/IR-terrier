	<brief_title>Seroquel Treatment Dysphoric Hypomania Bipolar II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder recognize severe treatment-refractory illness . Recent work multiple research center Europe U.S. find percentage patient experience hypomania also experience depressive symptom substantial . In recent Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network study , find 60 % visit least moderate hypomania associate depressive symptom . It generally agree patient experience mixed state combination mania depressive symptom less responsive old treatment lithium ( Swann et al. , 1997 ) . We propose evaluate response Seroquel add-on versus placebo add-on patient experience hypomania depressive symptom , either simultaneously closely juxtaposed within 2-3 day period . Bipolar II ( BDII ) patient make substantial percentage patient bipolar disorder , estimate conservatively 0.5 % US population , somewhat liberal definition hypomania minimum duration , Europe 1 % great . Importantly , virtually recent treatment trial high quality undertaken BDII . Treatment guideline algorithms bipolar disorder unable specify define treatment BDII due lack study . Juxtaposed limit control data , preliminary case series clinical experience support atypical antipsychotic helpful BDII patient . Thus impact high placebo control study Seroquel BDII . We believe study important undertake limit control data available treatment management patient bipolar II disorder outpatient setting . Numerous placebo-controlled monotherapy study complete inpatient setting bipolar I , many lead FDA submission registration . Maintenance trial underway develop bipolar I disorder . There medication specifically approve use bipolar II patient time . Additionally , initial trial registration Seroquel bipolar disorder include patient mixed symptom . Clear cut-offs provide order minimize likelihood patient mixed symptom would enter trial . Thus , trial propose provide data useful clinician real world setting , well provide data area previously cover trial registration study . We hypothesize Seroquel effective treat symptom patient BDII . A clinically important ground break aspect propose trial focus patient bipolar II disorder . There paucity data available evaluate use atypical antipsychotic patient bipolar II disorder . Preliminary data sort area clinically useful , set stage large definitive trial , translate readily practice .</detailed_description>
