	<brief_summary>Research study show child long-term survivor childhood leukemia may great risk early bone loss call osteoporosis . This bone loss may lead great risk break bone spine bone problem . However , researcher still know much frequently long-term side effect may occur severe problem . St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital researcher want determine frequency severity side effect . They also study whether take calcium Vitamin D supplement help child risk osteoporosis certain factor identify -- age diagnosis , cancer treatment , family history -- may increase chance osteoporosis . Researchers take x-ray study call quantitative compute tomography ( QCT ) measure bone mineral density ( BMD ) . The BMD measure bone strength . If subject 's BMD fall average , he/she assign one two group . Subjects randomly assign ( like toss coin ) receive calcium vitamin D pill . The half receive placebo pill look like calcium vitamin D pill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Severity-Adapted Clinical Trial Diminished Bone Mineral Density Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective study : - To estimate , use quantitative compute tomography ( QCT ) , prevalence diminish bone mineral density ( BMD ) patient treated contemporary , protocol-based multiagent chemotherapy ( +cranial irradiation ) childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . - To investigate possible risk factor development diminish BMD patient treat contemporary protocol-based therapy childhood ALL . Factors examine include patient characteristic ( age time treatment , gender , race , body mass index , physical activity nutritional status , menarchal status , oral contraceptive use , growth hormone therapy , smoke alcohol intake , birth weight , fracture history ) ; treatment effect ( intensity treatment antimetabolites glucocorticoid ; history cranial irradiation ) ; genetic predisposition ( i.e. , vitamin D CYP3A4 receptor polymorphism family history osteoporosis ) . - To evaluate , prospective placebo-controlled double-blinded randomize trial , effect vitamin D calcium supplementation addition nutritional counseling BMD patient BMD score mean age- gender-matched control , compare educational program nutritional counseling alone . Secondary Aim - To evaluate , prospective randomize trial , correlation BMD determine QCT BMD determine dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) patient BMD one standard deviation ( SD ) mean age- gender-matched control .</detailed_description>
