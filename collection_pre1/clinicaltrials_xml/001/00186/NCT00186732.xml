	<brief_summary>This study compare method closure Pfannenstiel incision commonly use gynecological obstetrical surgery . Patients assigned closure either surgical staple bury suture . Information collect day surgery , post-operative day two six-week follow visit . The amount pain cosmetic result compare . Infection rate also monitor two group . The study hypothesis follow : subcuticular ( bury ) suture compare surgical staple lead decrease post-operative pain improve cosmetic result . Infection rate similar group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Subcuticular Suture Versus Surgical Staples Closure Pfannenstiel Skin Incisions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There little evidence literature guide choice closure material Pfannenstiel laparotomy . Currently decision base primarily physician preference . Physicians differ greatly view well . This base personal habit experience scientific evidence . Specifically field obstetrics gynecology one randomize trial approximately 60 patient undergoing cesarean section compare subcuticular suture v surgical staple closure Pfannenstiel skin incision ( Frishman et al. , 1997 ) . This study show Pfannenstiel skin incision close subcuticular closure follow cesarean section result less postoperative pain cosmetically appeal compare incision close staple . This randomize control study compare closure Pfannenstiel incision use either subcuticular absorbable suture surgical staple . It examine two separate population - undergo cesarean section undergo gynecological surgery hysterectomy . These patient group analyze separately demographic characteristic tend quite different . The primary outcome postoperative pain . Cosmetic result secondary outcome . Cosmesis rat patient physician . Infection rate also great interest although unlikely study achieve adequate power show statistically significant difference result . Other outcomes interest include overall patient satisfaction , total operating room time length hospital stay . Patient 's body mass index also record analyzed determine whether affect result intervention group . There minimum 144 patient total cesarean section group 144 patient total gynecological surgery group - 72 randomized staple 72 randomize subcuticular suture group . Thus entire study involve approximately 288 patient .</detailed_description>
