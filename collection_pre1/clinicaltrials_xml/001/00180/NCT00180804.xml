	<brief_summary>For implantation develop conceptus , placental cell need invade mother 's uterus access maternal blood supply control manner . We find combination maternal immune gene ( KIR family ) fetal gene ( HLA-C ) strongly associate pre-eclampsia placenta implant adequately . The aim research investigate two gene family woman suffer recurrent miscarriage find possible link .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Little known reason early pregnancy failure . It believe pathology lead defective implantation fetus maternal uterus may lead recurrent early miscarriage . This project arise previous work pre-eclampsia find combination maternal immune gene ( KIR ) ligand ( HLA-C ) fetus strongly associate disease . We tissue type fetus , mother father case unexplained miscarriage . We hope genetic finding recurrent miscarriage lead new insight , prevention treatment .</detailed_description>
