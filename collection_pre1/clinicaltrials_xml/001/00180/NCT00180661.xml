	<brief_summary>Some patient mild asthma may develop severe asthma . It known make patient mild asthma become severe , plan find happens . Patients severe asthma may different type inflammation airway tubes . Patients severe asthma get much benefit take steroid inhaler tablet compare asthma patient mild disease . The study hypothesis inflammation severe asthma make steroid less effective treating asthma . We find possible abnormality blood cell bronchoalveolar macrophage cell lungs patient severe asthma compare mild moderate asthma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design Patients refer Royal Brompton Hospital severe asthma enter protocol determine whether asthma , , severity clinical feature asthma . Patients also undergo investigation relate asthma detail . We use agree Severe Asthma Research protocol ( SARP ) screen system diagnose asthma ( history , bronchodilator response presence bronchial hyperresponsiveness ) ( Screening questionnaire SARP Handbook ) . Usually , protocol carry patient admit 3-night admission . Patients undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy . We obtain cell bronchoalveolar lavage bronchial biopsy airway mucosa . These cell biopsy study vitro expression corticosteroid receptor nuclear translocation , expression cytokine , degree histone acetylation/deacetylation status . These finding compare cell biopsy obtain mild moderately severe asthma . In subgroup patient severe asthma , patient treat oral prednisolone 40 mg/day increase maintenance dose prednisolone 40 mg/day . Fiberoptic bronchoscopy repeat . Details intervention propose Some intervention list routine clinical use investigation severe asthma . For example , compute tomogram order clinical ground . A fiberoptic bronchoscopy perform . 1 . Demographic history history symptom asthma treatment use comprehensive questionnaire 2 . Quality life questionnaire ( AQLQ ) 3 . Skin prick test 16 common allergen 4 . Measuring lung function test 5 . Bronchial responsiveness methacholine 6 . Bronchial reversibility test inhale salbutamol 7 . Keeping diary card symptom , treatment peak flow 2 week 8 . Observance compliance treatment 9 . Provision sample sputum , spontaneous induce 10 . Measuring exhale nitric oxide ; collect exhale breath condensate 11 . Fiberoptic bronchoscopy obtain bronchoalveolar lavage cell , bronchial brushing bronchial biopsy 12 . Obtaining sample blood DNA extraction genetic analysis 13 . Obtaining blood blood mononuclear cell vitro analysis effect corticosteroid In patient mild-to-moderate asthma , test 8 perform . The detail intervention enclose SARP Handbook . Sources Recruitment Subjects : Patients recruit patient refer Royal Brompton Hospital referral diagnosis severe difficult asthma management . The Royal Brompton Hospital recognize nationally center referral patient . 7Inclusion criterion The final diagnosis severe asthma make accord screening step set . The definition require presence one major criterion ( treatment continuous near continuous oral corticosteroid and/or requirement treatment high dose inhaled steroid ) two minor criterion . Patients fit criterion severe asthma enter study . Age 18-60 ; sex . For investigation fiberoptic bronchoscopy , additional inclusion criterion impose : 1 . Post-bronchodilator FEV1 great 40 % day bronchoscopy 2 . No evidence exacerbation asthma within past 4 week . 3 . Ability cooperate procedure 4 . Ability give consent 5 . The bronchoscopist determine subject clinically appropriate bronchoscopy Patients exclude fiberoptic bronchoscopy : 1 . FEV1 le 35 % predict less 40 % predict bronchodilator administration 2 . Asthma clinically unstable 3 . Communication channel establish follow-up contact 4 . Clinically significant , unstable co-morbidities present Exclusion criterion Current smoker , ex-smokers great 10 pack year history smoking . Pregnancy unreliable contraceptive measure child-bearing woman . Volunteer subject We need comparative asthmatic subject mild moderately severe asthma . The group define follow , accord need treatment ( establish Asthma Management GINA BTS guideline ) : ( ) Mild : intermittent symptom need reliever bronchodilator le day ; ( ii ) moderate asthma : well-controlled asthma minimal symptom inhale corticosteroid therapy exceed 2,000 microgram beclomethasone equivalent . These patient recruit Asthma clinic attend Royal Brompton Hospital , also milder patient recruit advertisement within Hospital , local general practice . Current involvement research The patient enter study involve research project , must Completed project within month entry current study . From previous experience , aim recruit 12 patient severe asthma per year ; total , 50 patient severe asthma 4 year period . Concomitantly , recruit 40 mild-to-moderately severe asthma patient . Pharmacology Dispensing ( ) substance : Prednisolone tablet ( ii ) route administration : Oral ( iii ) frequency : day ( iv ) dosage : 30 mg/day ( addition 30 mg top maintainence dose ) ( v ) stage CSM evaluation : n/a .</detailed_description>
