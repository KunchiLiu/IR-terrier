	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate theory plasma level Glucagon like peptide 2 ( GLP-2 ) patient intestinal failure predict clinical recovery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plasma Determination Glucagon-like Peptide 2 Predictor Recovery Adults With Acute Intestinal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When major segment small bowel remove surgically , damage disease , length residual bowel may inadequate maintain overall nutrition net result describe `` intestinal failure '' . Without medical intervention , patient intestinal failure become malnourished dehydrated remain intestine unable absorb enough water , vitamins nutrient ingest food . Intravenous feed offer life save treatment cause complication like infection liver problem . It also pose enormous strain day day life . Glucagon like peptide 2 ( GLP-2 ) naturally occur hormone ( chemical messenger ) able increase surface area intestinal lining ( mucosal mass ) absorptive efficiency remain intestine . Intestinal failure patient part small bowel also large bowel surgically remove show markedly impaired rise GLP-2 level follow meal , contrast patient preserve large bowel increase level GLP-2 know much well functional adaptation . From hypothesise GLP-2 level directly relate , could predict , clinical recovery intestinal failure measure Amount parenteral nutrition require Length hospital stay Mortality We also aim compare GLP-2 level patient acute intestinal failure patient chronic intestinal failure well healthy control</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman , age 18 year age old time signing informed consent form . Referral direct admission St. Mark 's Hospital . Acute intestinal failure result TPN dependency result major intestinal resection perform admission St. Mark 's refer hospital . Inability give consent comply study . Inability take test meal ( unable test ) Severe renal impairment ( interference GLP2 excretion ) Severe uncorrected anaemia ( prevent additional bloodletting ) Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( risk hyperglycaemia )</criteria>
