	<brief_title>ACC - Atrial Contribution CRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient undergo advanced echocardiographic examination pre-operative , pre-discharge implantation 3 6-months follow-up . AV-delay optimization perform use aortic VTI measure continuous wave Doppler modify 4-chamber view . During optimisation aortic VTI measure different heart rate reach increase atrial pacing 10 , 20 30 beat intrinsic heart rate ( IHR ) .</detailed_description>
