	<brief_title>Simvastatin Treatment Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) disease characterise progressive narrowing blood vessel lung . This result pressure load heart heart failure . The narrowing part due constriction mostly due structural change affect vessel . The structural change affect cell component vessel wall ( endothelial lining , muscle layer fibrous tissue ) lead local clot formation . In addition evidence inflammation vessel know oxidative stress . The disease may occur obvious cause , know idiopathic , also associate variety disease , include congenital heart disease , collagen vascular disease HIV infection . Current approach treatment pulmonary hypertension unsatisfactory prevent disease progression directly adequately address many process detail . Alternative additional treatment therefore require attrative approach use statin ( 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA , HMG-CoA , reductase inhibitor ) . Statins widely use ability lower blood cholesterol increase evidence indicate drug also direct effect cell component vessel wall - include inhibit inflammation , clot formation oxidative stress - might beneficial pulmonary hypertension .</detailed_description>
