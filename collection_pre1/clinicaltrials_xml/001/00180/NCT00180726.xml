	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate mechanism whereby lung function decrease asthma sensitivity treatment . The hypothesis diseases asthma , inflammatory cell ( leukocyte ) include eosinophil , macrophage lymphocytes migrate lung release either different type inflammatory mediator and/or receptor compare subject without asthma , corticoid sensitive insensitive . The objective study identify gene specifically express important cell patient asthma view identify novel target drug therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We aim investigate separate cell type blood subject asthma identify gene highly express compare cell obtain patient without asthma . We investigate corticosteroid sensitivity gene expression asthma ( corticoid naive corticosteroid resistant asthma ) . We also investigate lung cell ( macrophage ) subject identify whether different gene express cell . We isolate different leukocyte population blood extract ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) sample . The type quantity RNA sample reflection specific gene express cell . Gene expression also evaluate ELISA.This RNA send Gene Logic USA company test sample identify gene express use Gene Arrays . This technique examine expression 33,000 human gene sample examine activation interacting pathway rather individual gene time . Samples analyse USA preliminary data show problem involve sample transportation degradation . Similar experiment perform use cell ( macrophage ) obtain follow bronchoalveolar lavage subject . We would aim examine response cell two group subject , namely ( ) non-asthmatics control ( ii ) asthmatic subject . The isolated cell either immediately solubilized solution purify RNA use isolate cell vitro follow stimulation investigate whether different gene express differential rate disease state . We examine cell derive peripheral blood cell ( macrophage ) obtain bronchoalveolar lavage aim determine whether difference attributable disease identify circulate cell site disease . This preliminary study determine profile inflammatory mediator expression leukocytes power calculation determine number subject appropriate . The objective study identify gene specifically express important cell patient asthma view identify novel target drug therapy .</detailed_description>

Healthy NonAsthmatic Subjects All normal volunteer meet follow criterion : 1 . Age 2170 year sex ( female take adequate contraceptive measure ) 2 . No history respiratory allergic disease e.g . PC20 methacholine &gt; 64mg/ml negative skin prick test 3 . Nonatopic negative skin prick test common aeroallergens 4 . Normal baseline spirometry predict age , sex height . 5 . Nonsmokers 6 . Not take regular medication 7 . No upper respiratory tract infection within last 6 week Subjects include study meet follow exclusion criterion : 1 . Clinically significant finding medical history physical examination asthma asthma group . 2 . Lung function FEV1 &lt; 30 % 3 . Pregnant woman mother breastfeed . 4 . Patients smoke 5 . Upper respiratory infection within last 4 week 6 . Allergy local anaesthetic 7 . Subjects unable give inform consent .</criteria>
