	<brief_title>Quick ICD Study : Is Extensive Electrophysiological Testing Before , During After ICD-Implantation Still Necessary ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Usually , EPS ICD-implantation perform allow risk stratification , test serial antiarrhythmic drug , find suitable ablation sit patient hemo-dynamically stable monomorphic VTs , exclude supraventricular tachycardia cause cardiac arrest help program detection rate enhancement criterion ICD . However , routine EPS preceeding ICD-implantation expose patient risk health care system considerable cost . So question raise , whether test still necessary costseffective , indiaction ICD-implantation clear clinical ground.The purpose study evaluate strategy implant ICD without EPS ICD-implantation randomise control trial , use combine endpoint major ICD-related adverse event primary outcome measure ( see detail `` Endpoints '' ) . The result view extra cost patientsÂ´ quality life study arms.Secondary outcome consider difference decision group difference event two group .</detailed_description>
