	<detailed_description>CAPTURE post-approval study collect information safety effectiveness ACCULINK ACCUNET since approval/clearance device FDA . The ACCULINK stent elastic-like metal tube use hold open narrow part blood vessel . The ACCUNET wire mesh basket place vessel catch material ( blood clot , fatty material ) could break narrowed area blood vessel block blood flow downstream stent procedure . Another goal CAPTURE study confirm ACCULINK ACCUNET use safely physicians varying level experience stenting procedure . The basis FDA 's approval/clearance ACCULINK ACCUNET ARCHeR trial ( ACCULINK/ACCUNET Revascularization Carotids High-Risk Patients ) . The ARCHeR trial conduct collect data safety effectiveness ACCULINK ACCUNET use treatment carotid artery disease patient high risk surgical treatment ( carotid endarterectomy ) medical surgical comorbidities . The ARCHeR trial show ACCULINK , use without ACCUNET , safe effective treatment option base rate death , stroke , myocardial infarction 30 day , stroke one year .</detailed_description>
