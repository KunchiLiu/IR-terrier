	<brief_summary>The MADIT-CRT trial design determine combine implantable cardiac defibrillator ( ICD ) -cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT-D ) reduce risk mortality heart failure ( HF ) event approximately 25 % , subject New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional Class II non-ischemic ischemic cardiomyopathy subject NYHA functional Class I ischemic cardiomyopathy , leave ventricular dysfunction ( ejection fraction [ EF ] &lt; = 0.30 ) , prolong intraventricular conduction ( QRS duration &gt; = 130 m ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , subject randomize CRT-D ICD-only . Randomization stratify clinical center ischemic status . Approximately 60 % subject randomly assign receive CRT-D biventricular pacing , 40 % receive ICD . Optimal pharmacological therapy heart failure require treatment arm . Length follow-up subject depend date entry study , since subject follow common study termination date .</detailed_description>
