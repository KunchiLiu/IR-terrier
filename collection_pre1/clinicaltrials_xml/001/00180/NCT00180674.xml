	<brief_summary>Patients treat hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection fail respond anti-viral treatment often concerned ongoing liver disease therefore look alternative treatment might prevent fibrosis progression . This view endorse patient representative group ( include Charles Gore HepC Trust ) welcome trial protocol . The trial randomise cross study 15 patient group . Each patient receive eight week anticoagulation eight week observation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Hepatitis C virus persistently infect 200 million people worldwide . Persistent infection cause inflammation liver lead fibrosis scarring . The fibrosis increase period 10 - 50 year become cirrhosis . Persistent infection lead cirrhosis , chronic liver failure liver cancer third individual . Treatment available eliminate hepatitis C virus infection successful approximately half patient . Treatment expensive , unpleasant take associate severe side effect . Therefore simple cheap effective mean reduce prevent liver fibrosis require patient take anti-viral therapy previously fail therapy . We others find patient genetically predispose coagulate ( thrombose ) blood rapidly normal also likely develop rapid liver fibrosis infect hepatitis C virus . We also show mouse model liver fibrosis mouse prothrombotic tendency develop liver fibrosis rapidly normal mouse normal mouse anticoagulated rate fibrosis significantly reduce . Anticoagulation widely use treat prevent deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism stroke . We believe anticoagulation may provide simple safe intervention slow prevent fibrosis patient hepatitis C virus infection possibly liver disease . Eventually need conduct long term study prove anticoagulation prevents development cirrhosis liver failure . However , order justify large scale , long term study first need show anticoagulation desire effect patient . This achieve demonstrate marker liver fibrosis measure blood respond appropriately anticoagulation therapy . A couple year ago find pro-coagulant factor V Leiden mutation confer susceptibility rapid fibrosis patient HCV infection . This subsequently confirm group . We recently demonstrate mice factor V Leiden mutation cause accelerate fibrosis response carbon tetrachloride whereas anticoagulation ameliorates fibrosis . Furthermore mice stellate-cell activation reduce anticoagulation . It well establish thrombin act PAR1 receptor activate stellate cell . Hence believe many cause liver injury promote liver fibrosis activate coagulation system , generate thrombin activates stellate cell . Our hypothesis therefore anticoagulation may decelerate fibrosis therefore delay prevent development end-stage liver disease . Aim : In pilot study wish explore feasibility approach . The aim would demonstrate improvement surrogate marker liver fibrosis relatively short period anticoagulation would provide data support trial grant application justification long term study . Trial Design : The design study follow . Randomised cross study 15 patient group . Eight week anticoagulation Eight week observation . Inclusion Criteria : - Age 18 - 70 ( male female ) - HCV infection PCR positive - ALT &gt; 60 - Liver fibrosis score ( within last 5 year ) &gt; 2 , &lt; 5 - Informed consent Exclusion Criteria : - Clinical evidence portal hypertension ( USS varix ) - Contra-indications anticoagulation include ( limited ) : - Recent peptic ulcer disease - Thrombocytopaenia ( &lt; 120 x 10^9 ) - Falls - Haemorrhagic stroke - Alcohol abuse ( &gt; 40 u/week ) - Continuing injection drug use - Already anticoagulant Patients serum fibrosis marker , micro-bubble US MRS perform enrollment , 8 week 16 week . Patients consent ( part clinical management HCV infection ) undergo liver biopsy end first 8 week study period . Anticoagulation : Each patient anticoagulated either warfarin ( Ximelagatran - available ) 8 week period . During period anticoagulation blood clotting ( INR value ) check regularly ensure stay within safe effective range ( INR 2.5 - 3.5 ) . This require patient attend department 2 - 3 time first two week treatment every two week blood clot measurement stable . Serum Markers : A panel serum marker include bilirubin , hyaluronic acid a2-macroglobulin , use fibrotest , well procollagen III peptide measure . Deviation marker value either individually ( composite - fibrotest - score ) compare treatment period observation period . Microbubble MRS Hepatic vein transit time MRS value measure enrollment , 8 week 16 week . Deviations value treatment period compare observation period group . Liver Biopsy : Liver biopsy 8 week course therapy justify ethically clinically . However , many patient suitable study due interval liver biopsy part monitoring HCV relate liver disease . Consenting patient biopsied end first 8 week period . In order minimise delay anticoagulation treatment liver biopsy vitamin K administer normalise INR value . The proportion activate stellate cell per high power field compare patient initial treatment group initial observation group .</detailed_description>
