	<brief_title>Study Imatinib ( Glivec ) Patients With Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients relapse and/or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma salivary gland head neck usually poor responder conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy . The investigation proliferation pathways involve tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit receptor ( KIT ) PDGF receptor may allow identify molecular target novel therapeutic approach patient adenoid cystic carcinoma fail locoregional treatment . Several publication literature pathological study conduct Institut Gustave Roussy show KIT overexpression observe least 80-90 % case adenoid cystic carcinoma , support investigation imatinib patient adenoid cystic carcinoma overexpressing KIT . Imatinib orally administrate , well tolerate compound could give outpatient schedule patient relapsing/metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma head neck . Because infrequent occurrence salivary gland malignancy , multicenter trial mandatory study include least 2 center represent Institut Gustave Roussy , Villejuif ; HÃ´pital Georges-Pompidou , Paris .</detailed_description>
