	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD short ) involve inflammation inside air passage lung . This inflammation might partly responsible shortness breath , cough susceptibility chest infection form part COPD . Inflammation cause , part , white blood cell attract blood air passage . Once inside air passage , white blood cell may change ( 'differentiate ' ) release substance produce inflammation attract white cell . The hypothesis lifespan cell may also prolong produce inflammatory mediator turn perpetuate inflammation . The cycle inflammation may damage lung , want see mediator release white blood cell determine inhibit effect exist new drug . We would also like see effect drug life-span function white blood cell . We compare behaviour characteristic white cell healthy smoker healthy non-smokers find anything different cell COPD patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regulation Release Inflammatory Mediators From Blood Leukocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study investigate mechanism regulate survival blood leukocyte well synthesis release inflammatory mediator cell normal individual subject COPD . The hypothesis COPD life-span leukocyte , neutrophil , enhance may contribute inflammation , prominent characteristic disease , secrete release inflammatory mediator . We also suggest difference may exist sensitivity various leukocytes different therapy . Leukocytes purify peripheral venous blood patient COPD well healthy individual . We investigate effect novel exist therapeutic agent leukocyte survival inflammatory mediator synthesis release . We also examine regulation release enzymes know damage lung tissue . Further study carry elucidate signal transduction pathway lead activation , alter longevity function leukocytes . In experiment ribonucleic acid RNA may extract form leukocyte investigate gene involve . The primary objective identify mechanism enhance leukocyte longevity inflammatory mediator and/or enzyme synthesis release view identify novel target drug therapy .</detailed_description>
