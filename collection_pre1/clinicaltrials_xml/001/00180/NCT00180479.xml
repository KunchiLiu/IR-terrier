	<brief_title>SPIRIT III Clinical Trial XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System ( EECSS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose SPIRIT III clinical trial evaluate safety efficacy XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System ( XIENCE V® EECSS ) . The XIENCE V® EECS ( XIENCE V® arm ) compare active control group represent FDA approve commercially available Boston Scientific TAXUS® EXPRESS2™ Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent ( TAXUS® EXPRESS2™ PECS ) System ( TAXUS® arm ) . The SPIRIT III clinical trial consist randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) US enroll approximately 1,002 subject ( 2:1 randomization XIENCE V® EECS : TAXUS® EXPRESS2™ PECS ) maximum two de novo native coronary artery lesion treatment within vessel size &gt; = 2.5 mm &lt; = 3.75 mm . The SPIRIT III clinical trial also consist three concurrent US non-randomized arm ( 2.25 mm diameter stent , 4.0 mm diameter stent 38 mm length stent arm ) one Japanese non-randomized arm follow : 1 . 105 subject maximum two de novo native coronary artery lesion within vessel size &gt; 2.25 mm &lt; 2.5 mm lesion length &lt; = 22 mm enrol concurrently US 2.25 mm non-randomized treatment arm 2 . 80 subject maximum two de novo native coronary artery lesion within vessel size &gt; 3.75 mm &gt; = 4.25 mm lesion length &lt; = 28 mm enrol concurrently US 4.0 mm non-randomized treatment arm 3 . 105 subject maximum two de novo native coronary artery lesion within vessel size &gt; 3.0 mm &lt; 4.25 mm lesion length &gt; 24 mm &lt; 32 mm enrol concurrently US 38 mm non-randomized treatment arm . 4 . 88 Japanese subject maximum two de novo native coronary artery lesion within vessel size &gt; = 2.5 mm &lt; = 4.25 mm lesion length &lt; = 28 mm enrol concurrently non-randomized Japanese arm . All subject RCT four non-randomized arm screen per protocol require inclusion/exclusion criterion . The data collect compare data subject enrol TAXUS® arm US RCT . Subjects enrol US RCT sub-grouped base whether angiographic and/or intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) follow-up 240 day follow : Group A : Angiographic IVUS follow-up 240 day ( N=240 ) Group B : Angiographic follow-up 240 day ( N=324 ) Group C : No angiographic IVUS follow-up ( N=438 ) All subject clinical follow-up 30 , 180 , 240 270 day ( Data collect 270 day submit primary data set US Japanese market approval ) , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year ( annual report ) . All subject enrol three US non-randomized arm ( N=105 2.25 mm arm , N=80 4.0 mm arm N=105 38 mm stent arm ) clinical follow-up 30 , 180 , 240 , 270 day , angiographic follow-up 240 day . No IVUS follow-up required subject enrol arm . All subject enrol Japanese non-randomized arm ( N=88 ) clinical follow-up 30 , 180 , 240 , 270 day , angiographic IVUS follow-up 240 day . All subject receive bailout stent assign Group A follow-up subgroup ( angiographic IVUS follow-up 240 day index procedure ) , regardless primary assignment randomization . At site without IVUS capability , subject receive bailout stent assign Group B follow-up subgroup ( angiographic follow-up 240 day index procedure ) . Angiographic follow-up require bailout subject 240 day . Data US RCT submit FDA primary data set product approval RVD &gt; = 2.5 mm &lt; = 3.75 mm ( 2.5 mm , 3.0 mm 3.5 mm stent ) . Combined data US trial/Japanese non-randomized arm submit Japanese Ministry Health , Labor Welfare ( MHLW ) Japanese approval RVD &gt; =2.5 mm &lt; = 4.25 mm ( 2.5 mm , 3.0 mm 3.5 mm 4.0 mm stent ) . Data Japanese non-randomized arm submit FDA additional safety data . Data US non-randomized arm trial primary data set approval 2.25 mm diameter stent ( RVD &gt; 2.25 mm &lt; 2.5 mm ) , 4.0 mm diameter stent ( RVD &gt; 3.75 mm &lt; = 4.25 mm ) 38 mm length stent ( RVD &gt; 3.0 mm &lt; = 4.25 mm lesion length &gt; 24 mm &lt; = 32 mm ) , respectively US . A pharmacokinetic substudy carry minimum 5 pre-determined site US minimum 5 pre-determined site Japan . In US , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) everolimus , deliver XIENCE V® EECS analyze subset 15 subject ( minimum ) single vessel/lesion treatment , 20 subject dual vessel/lesion treatment , respectively . In Japan , minimum 10 subject single vessel/lesion treatment 20 subject dual vessel/lesion treatment PK measurement perform . These subset include subject receive overlap stent .</detailed_description>
