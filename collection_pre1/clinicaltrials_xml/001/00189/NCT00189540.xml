	<detailed_description>The primary goal study evaluate AMG0001 administration CLI subject investigate efficacy safety AMG0001 . Specifically , objective : 1 . Assess efficacy dose regimen 4.0mg/3 mL AMG0001 , administer Days 0 , 14 , 28 measure reduction total wound area Month 3 . 2 . Assess potential effect angiogenesis associate dose regimen 4.0mg/3 mL AMG0001 , administer Days 0 , 14 , 28 measure reduction total wound area Months 6 12 , along reduction major amputation improve pain rest measure VAS hemodynamic measure ( ABI/TBI ) Month 3 Month 6 . 3 . Assess overall safety AMG0001 Critical Limb Ischemia subject population determine physical examination , blood urine analysis , electrocardiogram , vital sign , evaluation adverse experience course treatment .</detailed_description>
