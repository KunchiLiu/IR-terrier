	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess role dietary fibre Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) treatment , particular role increase content soluble insoluble fibre daily diet . The primary objective compare soluble ( psyllium ) insoluble ( bran ) placebo , administer 12 week patient ‘ probable ’ ‘ definite ’ Irritable Bowel Syndrome . The primary efficacy parameter responder rate base weekly assessment adequate relief IBS symptom . Secondary efficacy parameter include change IBS relate symptom ( abdominal pain , bowel habit ) quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Interventions Irritable Bowel Syndrome : Soluble , Insoluble Fibre ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : In daily practice , patient doctor consider dietary factor , especially fibre fluid intake , play important role aetiology persistence Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) symptom . The majority doctor provide dietary lifestyle advice , target increase fibre content daily diet add insoluble fibre . In addition 50 % IBS patient receive pharmacotherapy , frequently include bulk agent , particular soluble fibre psyllium-supplements . There , however , limited evidence fibre therapy may alleviate IBS symptom . In addition , indication insoluble fibre may even worsen IBS symptom . Scientific evidence pertain different effect soluble insoluble fibre IBS symptom limit indeed , methodologically sound RCTs primary care patient lack altogether . The latter important since primary care IBS patient differ many aspect secondary/tertiary care patient . STUDY DESIGN : A double blind parallel-group randomise control trial involve IBS patient primary care compare 12-week intervention psyllium fibre , bran , placebo . After intervention , patient follow additional 12-week period . STUDY POPULATION : Patients age 18-65 year present General Practitioner ( GP ) either incident IBS symptom relapse pre-existing IBS well patient prior GP diagnosis IBS currently experience symptom eligible study . Patients stratify two equally large patient group ( ) 'definite ' IBS , accord Rome II diagnostic criterion , ( b ) 'probable ' IBS , pragmatically diagnose IBS GP . Patients alarm symptom ( i.e . abnormality physical examination , fever , weight loss , rectal bleeding ) , fibre intolerance , acute abdominal pain , patient treatment IBS specialist prior 48 month , patient active psychiatric disorder require medication patient unable fill questionnaire exclude . INTERVENTION : Patients randomly allocate 12-week treatment period ( ) 10 gram psyllium fibre , ( b ) 10 gram wheat bran ( c ) 10 gram identical placebo take 2 dos meal . In healthy subject , median intake 20 gram fibre per day . When focus increase amount fibre daily diet IBS treatment , addition 10 gram fibre diet ( bring total fibre content diet 30 gram ) , usually consider adequate . This combined sufficient intake fluid . All study medication fill comparable pot . To prevent constipation , participant instruct change dietary habit , take additional 1 litre fluid daily . Other possible side effect unpleasant feeling de upper gut rarely allergic reaction rash , rhinitis conjunctivitis . Cellulose possibly bind glycoside , salicylate , coumarine derivates en nitrofurantoïne . Participants instruct take fibre least 2 hour medication . OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS : In line previous conclusion optimal outcome assessment trial functional GI disease , primary endpoint Adequate Relief question . This measure address symptom improvement IBS treatment single question ( Did adequate relief IBS-related abdominal pain discomfort past week ? ) score dichotomous scale . This instrument well validated simple outcome assessment IBS treatment . A positive response define 2 week Adequate Relief per month . Secondary outcome measure include IBS symptom , disease specific quality life , fibre intake , number doctor visit , cost . IBS symptom monitor use IBS symptom severity score ( IBS SSS ) . This well- validated IBS symptom score , integrate five aspect bowel dysfunctioning actual intensity IBS symptom , use visual analogue scale . Disease-specific quality life registrated Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality Life scale ( IBS QOL ) . This instrument include 30 item nine subscales . It validate different population . Fibre intake monitor every 4 week use Food Frequency Questionnaire . Habitual fibre intake calculate questionnaire data . This instrument self-administered food frequency questionnaire validate ranking subject accord intake dietary fibre . After active treatment period 12 week , patient follow additional period 12 week assess sustainability effect intervention . The primary outcome measure weekly basis . The secondary endpoint record 1 , 2 , 3 6 month start intervention , follow-up visit general practitioner . All additional consultation , diagnostics procedure , medication , referral intervention period record electronic medical file practice . Compliance check every visit weight content trial medication registration patient ’ diary . REQUIRED SAMPLE SIZE : Ninety-five patient require per treatment arm . Assuming minimal clinically relevant difference proportion responder ( i.e . 2 week Adequate Relief per month ) active placebo treatment 20 % , placebo response 40 % , treatment effect 60 % expect . Taking type II error 20 % type I error 5 % allow 10 % dropout , totally 285 IBS patient require . Assuming estimate mean incidence IBS primary care , 8 per 1000 patient year ( 20 patient per practice per year ) , expect inclusion rate 25 % , expect 60 general practitioner , include 5 patient , able include require number patient one year . GPs recruit Utrecht Maastricht general practitioner research network . GPs networks tradition participate academic research ample expertise participate clinical trial primary care . DATA ANALYSIS : Statistical analysis base intention-to-treat principle . Adequate Relief , IBS Symptom Score Quality Life 12-week treatment period additional 12-week post-treatment period compare score baseline observation ( t=0 ) , use Student T-tests repeat measurement variance analysis . Stability treatment effect time assess use one-factorial ANOVA repeat measure . The proportion responder Adequate Relief question ( i.e . &gt; 2 week Adequate Relief per month ) compare use chi-square test . In case ( unexpected ) difference relevant baseline characteristic three comparison group multiple regression analysis perform . ADMINISTRATION : The project cover 24 month . The first 3 month study necessary prepare study . The inclusion period last 12 month , 6 additional month require complete follow-up perform first statistical analysis prepare manuscript . The last 3 month use definitive data analysis finalisation report .</detailed_description>
