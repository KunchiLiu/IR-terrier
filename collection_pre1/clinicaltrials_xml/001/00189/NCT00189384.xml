	<brief_summary>Approximately one-third neonatal death develop country due infection acquire birth canal and/or exposure unclean environment soon birth . Current World Health Organization recommendation management infant young 2 month age serious bacterial infection involve hospitalization parenteral therapy least 10 day antibiotic regimen contain penicillin ampicillin combine aminoglycoside.However , many setting throughout develop world , currently possible , standard care likely feasible near future . Several study report variety sociocultural reason many family unable unwilling access hospital-based care sick young infant get hospitalize , instead , receive variety home-based antibiotic therapy , none . In community field site , approximately 70 % family refuse hospital referral sick newborn , despite provision transport . Thus , urgent need define role community/first-level facility-based care versus hospitalization management young infant serious bacterial infection , potential community-based parenteral antibiotic alternative strategy resource poor area high neonatal mortality rate . Bang colleague demonstrate significant reduction neonatal mortality infection underdeveloped rural district Maharashtra , India field-based case management approach use oral cotrimoxazole intramuscular gentamicin give 7 day treatment neonates sepsis . This study equivalence randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare daily IM ceftriaxone injection daily IM procaine penicillin gentamicin injection , daily intramuscular gentamicin injection twice daily oral cotrimoxazole , give 7 day baby clinically-diagnosed possible serious bacterial infection ( pneumonia , sepsis without local infection skin umbilical infection ) whose family refuse referral hospital . After supplementary informed consent , patient meet specific inclusion exclusion criterion randomly allocate one three regimen test . The study hypothesis 3 regimen perform equally well treatment sepsis first-level facility setting .</brief_summary>
