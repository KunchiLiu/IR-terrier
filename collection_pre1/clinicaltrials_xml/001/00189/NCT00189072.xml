	<brief_title>Effects Gabapentin Treatment Neuropathic Pain Driving Performance Cognition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous study demonstrate neuropsychological impairment patient chronic pain , particularely measure assess attentional capacity , process speed psychomotor speed . About 50 % patient suffer neuropathic pain treat anticonvulsant , treatment serious pain complaint , experience good pain relief . Gabapentin one prescribe anticonvulsant treatment neuropathic pain . An important disadvantage treatment gabapentin could occurrence side effect , somnolence fatigue . These side effect constitute crucial problem patient treat gabapentin must operate motor vehicle dangerous machinery . However , pain affect cognition negatively , possibly also drive . Therefore , another possibility treatment gabapentin pain complaint improve drive pain less influence . Since drive activity daily live important maintaining independency community , access employment social activity , important establish effect use gabapentin ability . No study conduct far investigate drive ability patient neuropathic pain , treat gabapentin.The aim study explore effect pain one hand effect acute ( Day 1 ) subchronic ( Day 15 ) treatment pain gabapentin ( 900 , 1200 , 1800 2400 mg ) hand actual driving performance several laboratory test patient neuropathic pain . It hypothesize gabapentin might influence performance acute subchronic administration . This study two-period double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over randomise study .</detailed_description>
