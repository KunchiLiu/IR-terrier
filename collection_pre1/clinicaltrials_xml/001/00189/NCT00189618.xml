	<brief_title>The Effects Physical Training , ASA ( Aspirin ) , Clopidogrel Walking Capacity Patients With Stage II Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) see isolation represent peripheral manifestation generalize atherosclerosis . The co-morbidity coronary heart disease and/or cerebral atherosclerosis range 20 % 90 % , depend degree severity PAD 1-5 . The relative risk ( predominantly cardiac ) death increase factor 2 already asymptomatic PAD patient ; risk increase furthermore another factor 2 4 patient become symptomatic . PAD rare disease prevalence 15 % 20 % elderly western population ( &gt; 50 year age ) . While clinical presentation PAD relatively benign majority case , disease carry high risk potential high directly indirectly relate cost . Thus , medical also socio-economic point view , need control PAD complication rate relate treatment cost effectively possible . The physiological treatment approach , internationally accept , physical training . There agreement , physical training improve collateralisation vascular lesion , improve rheologic property blood , also lead shift glycolytic ( type 2 ) oxidative ( type 1 ) muscle fiber work musculature . This shift associate increase capillary density , fact subsequently favor optimal oxygen extraction oxygen utilisation . Another effect physical training , may utmost importance , relate potential modify patient risk factor profile . It show epidemiological , clinical , experimental study , even moderate physical training increase insulin receptor sensitivity ( hence positively influence one major factor atherosclerosis ) , increase fibrinolytic activity follow prothrombotic stimulation , decrease diastolic blood pressure hypertensive patient , decrease LDL/HDL ratio , decrease overall cardiac mortality . The aim treatment intermittent claudication clinically relevant improvement patient 's mobility quality-of-life . In previous study show , 3 month structure , supervise PAD rehabilitation program satisfy demand lead improvement initial ( painfree ) claudication distance approximately 190 % . One third patient study start Clopidogrel supportive pharmacotherapy begin trial . It interesting note optimal training result ( defined improvement ICD &gt; 200 % ) see patient treat Clopidogrel report patient receive ASA ( aspirin ) top training . Non-published data Art.Net . preclinical group ( Dr . I. Höfer , Dr . I. Buschmann , Freiburg ) , present Art.Net . meeting March 24 , 2003 show use rabbit hind leg model , magnitude GM-CSF MCP-1 induce arteriogenesis reduce approximately 40 % ASA co-administered ; contrast , Clopidogrel use model neutral . There broad international agreement patient generalized atherosclerosis particularly patient suffer PAD ( high risk ischemic coronary and/or cerebral complication ) treat antiaggregant . For pharmacoeconomic reason drug choice normally ASA . However , follow Höfer 's result , ASA , although effectively prevent thrombotic complication , may hinder arteriogenetic process require normalize physical capacity QoL PAD patient , negative ASA effect find Clopidogrel . Preliminary data human seem support hypothesis symptomatic stage II PAD patient Clopidogrel may superior ASA , hypothesis , order become conclusive , must confirm result evidence level 1 clinical trial .
