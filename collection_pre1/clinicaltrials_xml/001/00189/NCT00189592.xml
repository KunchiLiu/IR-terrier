	<brief_title>Plantar Fasciosis Treatment Using Coblation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe recalcitrant heel pain , result repetitive trauma plantar fascia , relatively commonly observe phenomenon . Although condition frequently refer 'heel spur ' , plantar fasciitis ( acute inflammatory stage ) plantar fasciosis ( chronic degeneration ) currently accept accurate term . Symptoms often occur first step morning may also effect intense activity prolong standing . The source pain symptom , usually perceive gradual onset burning , locate origin plantar fascia calcaneous ( heel bone ) . Risk factor low high arch over-pronation foot , systemic disease , obesity may exacerbate pain . More two million Americans receive treatment year plantar fasciitis fasciosis . Conservative treatment option plantar fasciosis include rest , stretch , strengthen , massage , progress non-steroidal anti-inflammatory , steroid injection iontophoresis continued recalcitrance . Orthotics , heel cup , night splint plantar strap conservative option frequently recommend treating physician . Patient outcomes response conservative measure usually positive , non-responsive case , approximately 10 % presenting case , receive surgical care . Extracorporeal shockwave treatment recently advocate recalcitrant case show effective 60-80 percent case . Plantar fascia release , either partial complete , commonly surgical procedure choice treat plantar fasciosis . However , surgery risk complication think alter biomechanics foot , may link post-operative lateral column pain long-term disability . Because potential postoperative sequela plantar fascia release , valuable examine less invasive surgical technique treat recalcitrant plantar fasciosis . The concept use plasma RF-based microsurgical approach viable modality treat tendinosis , , recalcitrant plantar fasciosis , originally draw research work conduct patient treated congestive heart failure use laser RF-based transmyocardial revascularization ( TMR ) . The mechanism action behind clinical success observe laser RF-based TMR theorize associate localized angiogenic healing response note occur following procedure . Localized angiogenesis observe previously use mechanical device TMR , also less successful clinically . To substantiate adopt TMR-like approach treat tendinosis , capability plasma RF-based microsurgery initiate angiogenic heal response examine vivo use histology biochemical analysis . The sum several study provide good evidence suggest plasma RF-based microsurgery promote angiogenic healing response use appropriate application . Preliminary clinical experience follow plasma RF-based micro-tenotomy demonstrate excellent success treat chronic , refractive tendinosis . The investigator report technique technically simple perform much less invasive conventional surgery . Patients rapid uncomplicated recovery report minimal pain 7-10 day follow procedure ; pain relief persist improved 24 month . Magnetic resonance imaging correlate well clinical result . These promise clinical finding , well evidence basic research study , lead u consider evaluate plasma RF-based approach treat symptomatic , chronic , recalcitrant heel pain resemble plantar fasciosis . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness Coblation-based fasciotomy relieve pain associate recalcitrant plantar fasciosis , secondarily , determine whether may additional potential benefit stem use , reduce incidence postoperative complication improve function , compare conventional surgery .</detailed_description>
