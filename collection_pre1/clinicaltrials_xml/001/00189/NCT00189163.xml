	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PLAN : Chronic hepatitis C lead cause cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma U.S. common cause liver transplantation . Treatment chronic hepatitis C remain problematic unsatisfactory . Several factor influence response treatment importantly hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) genotype ( sustained virological response/SVR see 40-45 % vs. 75-80 % use pegylated IFN + ribavirin combination therapy genotype 1 vs. 2/3 ) . Recently , presence hepatic steatosis show important predictor disease progression also response antiviral therapy especially patient genotype 1 infection . The mechanisms hepatic steatosis HCV multi-factorial ; presence insulin resistance ( IR ) appear key factor especially genotype 1 ( metabolic steatosis ) similar see patient non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . Whereas metabolic steatosis appear factor resistance antiviral therapy , viral steatosis ( direct viral induce genotype 3 ) reduce achieve SVR . We recently also observed IR common type 1 HCV infection even low BMIs present even non-steatotic hepatitis C patient , suggest direct effect viral infection insulin sensitivity IR may precede hepatic steatosis . We hypothesize patient HCV genotype 1 infection , therapy aim improve insulin sensitivity conjunction standard antiviral therapy may reduce insulin resistance hepatitis C also improve hepatic steatosis , decrease expression pro-inflammatory cytokine reduce oxidative stress thereby prevent disease progression . In addition , also hypothesize improvement IR hepatic steatosis may also result improved virological response antiviral therapy . This study introduce novel concept use insulin sensitize thiazolidinedione agent pioglitazone improve insulin sensitivity , improve hepatic steatosis possibly result high rate virological response give conjunction standard antiviral therapy treatment naïve patient genotype 1 infection . Our main goal study effect pioglitazone insulin sensitivity hepatic steatosis addition effect SVR along confirm safety pioglitazone patient hepatitis C. To knowledge , first randomize , placebo-controlled study insulin sensitize agent treatment patient chronic hepatitis C. We hope finding study shed new light mechanism associate pathogenesis hepatitis C lead new effective treatment management important disease . Insulin resistance ( IR ) , key factor development steatosis , common finding patient hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . In patient genotype 1 infection , IR note 80 % patient study . In patient non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) evidence nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , role IR lead decrease fatty acid oxidation , increased production pro-inflammatory cytokine increase oxidative stress propose important mechanism lead steatosis subsequent liver cell injury . Recently , association steatosis hepatic fibrosis emphasize HCV infection , similar describe patient NAFLD . While IR hepatic steatosis common finding patient HCV infection , latter prevalence rate 40 % 70 % , different HCV genotypes confers distinct risk steatosis ; great degree steatosis see patient genotype 3 infection compare others . Similar see patient NAFLD , patient infect genotype 1 HCV show relationship body mass index ( BMI ) risk steatosis . However , 30 % patient HCV infection hepatic steatosis , risk factor steatosis identify . The investigator ' preliminary data show even HCV infect individual low BMI steatosis , IR risk steatosis increase directly compare NAFLD patient . Recent data also suggest presence hepatic steatosis independent predictor decrease response antiviral therapy even control genotype . This especially important patient type 1 infection . The investigator hypothesize patient HCV genotype 1 infection , treatment antiviral therapy partial effect reduce insulin resistance ( IR ) steatosis augment addition insulin sensitize thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) agent pioglitazone treatment regimen . The investigator also hypothesize rate sustain virological response ( SVR ) high antiviral regimen + pioglitazone treat group compare patient receive antiviral therapy alone . The investigator ' specific aim follow : 1 . To assess improvement insulin sensitivity patient treatment naïve genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C treat standard antiviral therapy + pioglitazone placebo 2 . To assess improvement hepatic steatosis patient treatment naïve genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C treatment standard antiviral therapy + pioglitazone placebo 3 . To assess rate sustain virological response ( SVR ) among patient treatment naïve genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C treat standard antiviral therapy + pioglitazone compare standard antiviral therapy + placebo CLINICAL STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Overview : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study pioglitazone give combination standard antiviral therapy treatment genotype 1 infected hepatitis C patient treatment naïve . We determine rate improvement homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) hepatic steatosis 48 week therapy compare baseline along determine rate SVR two treatment group . In addition , also assess safety pioglitazone patient chronic hepatitis C infection . All eligible patient undergo percutaneous liver biopsy within 6 month enrollment assess severity hepatitis C , steatosis feature steatohepatitis study pathologist . A period 6 month prior enrollment select order recent representation degree steatosis histologic severity hepatitis C effect therapy histologic feature one important aim study . A HOMA index value &gt; 2.0 select define IR study ( see : Inclusion criterion ) value consider abnormal indicative decrease insulin sensitivity . Histological severity chronic hepatitis C do use modified histological activity index ( HAI ) score system Ishak grade stag chronic viral hepatitis steatosis steatohepatitis do use score system currently use NIH-funded Virahep-C study , PI currently member . We currently IRB approve protocol University Michigan collect sample liver tissue time liver biopsy patient hepatitis C NAFLD study fat gene expression . We collect sample patient consider study undergoing liver biopsy initial evaluation . We also collect similar sample time repeat liver biopsy study . This give u unique opportunity study effect pioglitazone fat-related gene expression relationship response study study ( change IR steatosis virological response therapy ) . Given pilot study pioglitazone patient hepatitis C potential hepatotoxicity drug hepatitis C well know due limit available data , plan enroll treatment-naïve patient evidence least fibrosis liver biopsy ( minimum Ishak fibrosis score 1 ) although reason expect significant drug induce liver injury drug . Patients evidence cirrhosis liver biopsy ( Ishak fibrosis score 5 6 ) exclude since cirrhosis associate IR thereby bias finding . Although expect see increased hepatotoxicity due pioglitazone patient hepatitis C general , whether cirrhosis increase potential risk unknown time . Similarly , also plan exclude patient know diabetes mellitus ( DM ) minimize bias especially since interferon therapy affect glucose tolerance may lead difficult control patient pre-existing diabetes . In hepatitis C patient population , although prevalence DM le 15 % , addition diabetic patient may also confound analysis unless stratify randomization base presence absence DM since pilot study limit sample size , decide exclude diabetic . Another factor would correct influence glucose control agent insulin sensitivity study . All eligible patient interested study invite come GCRC regular interval study assessment . During visit , brief physical examination perform blood collect stored future research purpose . The current standard treatment chronic hepatitis C patient genotype 1 infection combination pegylated interferon ribavirin 48 week . Treatment response define follow : - Sustained Virological Responder ( SVR ) - undetectable HCV RNA serum therapy 24 week follow-up ; - Relapser - undetectable HCV RNA serum end treatment reappearance RNA therapy stop ; expect less 15 % initial responder relapse stop treatment ; - Non-Responder - presence HCV RNA serum end therapy follow-up . Although patient genotype 1 detectable HCV RNA 24 week therapy usually label non-responders treatment stop clinical practice , patient study complete 48 week treatment unless regimen stop due side effect patient preference . This potential beneficial effect therapy ( addition pioglitazone antiviral therapy ) IR hepatic steatosis possibly even fibrosis even among viral non-responders treat 48 week . Once treatment complete , patient invite come GCRC 12 week follow end treatment undergo repeat liver biopsy . Total follow-up treatment stop 24 week patient . Patient Population : All eligible adult patient compensate liver disease due chronic infection HCV genotype 1 infection treatment naïve enrol study . All racial ethnic group recruit study . Patients cirrhosis decompensated liver disease patient , liver biopsy contraindicate , exclude . Race ( African American/Black non-Hispanic white ) assign base information give patient . It reflect individual 's recognition community . This assignment race/ethnicity similar practice governmental agency include U.S. Census Bureau Center Disease Control . All patient sign IRB approve HIPAA compliant consent form enrol study .</detailed_description>
