	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Cardiac Screening High Risk Patients -The GROUND Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) common disease associate considerably increase risk future event high prevalence coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Improvement prognosis patient group need . Screening CAD become option recent development CT-angiography MR stress test . It unknown high-risk patient group benefit screen non-invasive cardiac imaging . Therefore propose study whether cardiac image algorithm , use non-invasive imaging technique follow evidence-based treatment reduce risk cardiovascular disease cardiac asymptomatic PAD patient . The GROUND study design prospective , multi-center , randomized clinical trial . Patients peripheral arterial disease , yet without history symptomatic cardiac disease ask participate . All patient receive proper therapeutic advice randomization . Half recruit patient enter 'control group ' receive CT calcium scoring . The half recruit patient ( index group ) undergo non invasive cardiac image algorithm follow evidence-based treatment . First patient undergo CT calcium score CT angiography . Patients leave main ( equivalent ) coronary artery stenosis CT angiography refer cardiologist without image . All patient group undergo Dobutamine Stress Magnetic Resonance ( DSMR ) test . Patients DSMR positive ischemia also refer cardiologist . Most referred patient likely undergo conventional coronary artery angiography cardiac intervention ( CABG PCI ) indicate . All participant trial enter 5 year follow period occurrence future cardiovascular event . Interim analysis take place base power calculation 1200 patient need reach significance . Implications The GROUND study provide new insight question whether non-invasive cardiac imaging reduces risk cardiovascular event patient peripheral arterial disease , yet without symptom coronary artery disease example high risk patient group .</detailed_description>
