	<brief_title>Long-Term Cognitive Decline After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting : Off-Pump Surgery Beneficial ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Coronary artery bypass surgery associate postoperative cognitive decline , largely attribute use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . A large recent study Newman et al demonstrate incidence cognitive decline 24 % six month surgery , increase 42 % five year . In recently conduct Octopus Randomized Trial , cognitive decline three month surgery present 29 % patient operate CPB . In patient operate without CPB , incidence 21 % , i.e . slightly well . Hypothesis : Improvement cognitive outcome avoid cardiopulmonary bypass become apparent five year surgery , compare three month surgery . Study objectives : The objective present study compare effect coronary bypass surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass cognitive clinical outcome , five year surgery . Methods : The 281 participant Octopus Study , operate March 1998 August 2000 randomize off-pump on-pump coronary bypass surgery , invite additional assessment cognitive clinical status quality life , five year surgery . Patients undergo battery ten neuropsychologic test determine cognitive status . Clinical status assess interview . Questionnaires use measure quality life .</detailed_description>
