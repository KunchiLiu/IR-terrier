	<detailed_description>Most chronic pain patient engage daily activity include driving . Driving car complex task require mental alertness variety cognitive function perception , attention , learning , memory decision making.Several study demonstrate cognitive impairment laboratory task patient chronic pain , particularly measure assess attentional capacity , process speed psychomotor speed . These finding suggest car driving performance might impair , chronic pain patient may therefore increase traffic accident risk . Unfortunately , study investigate impact chronic pain actual driving ability . The present study design investigate effect chronic pain actual driving performance normal traffic . In addition on-the-road driving test , psychomotor , memory test measure driving-related skill conduct laboratory . Moreover , effect pain attentional capacity test test use event-related potential .</detailed_description>
