	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether perform active compression decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( ACD-CPR ) impedance threshold device ( ITD ) compare conventional standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( S-CPR ) impact neurologic recovery survival hospital discharge follow out-of-hospital cardiac arrest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ResQ Trial : Impact ITD Active Compression Decompression CPR Survival From Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite receive conventional , standard CPR ( S-CPR ) , patient experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest die prior arrive hospital . At present time , hospital discharge rate follow out-of-hospital , nontraumatic cardiac arrest adult United States estimate less 5 % . Many factor contribute current poor survival statistic , include inefficiency technique . CPR provide 10 % 20 % normal myocardial perfusion , 20 % 30 % physiologically normal cerebral perfusion . A new method CPR combine ACD ITD ( ACD-CPR+ITD ) show animal model clinical trial conduct Europe provide significantly blood flow vital organ improve survival rate compare S-CPR ACD-CPR alone . ACD-CPR+ITD work decrease intrathoracic pressure chest wall recoil ( decompression ) phase CPR , create vacuum within thorax relative rest body . When compare control , use ACD-CPR+ITD ( ) enhance blood return thorax chest wall recoil phase , ( b ) enhance blood flow heart brain , ( c ) provide real-time feedback rescuer maintain high-quality CPR , ( ) improve overall CPR efficiency , result forgoing , ( e ) improve short-term survival rate . The sponsor others recently evaluate effectiveness combination conventional , manual standard CPRÂ±ITD animal human . The ITD increase short-term survival rate study well . Two clinical trial perform Milwaukee , Wisconsin , IDE ( # G980125 ) . Both compare S-CPR either sham ( nonfunctional placebo ) active ( functional ) ITD . The result hemodynamic study demonstrate systolic blood pressure , primary end point , increase approximately 45 mmHg sham ITD approximately 85 mmHg active ITD ( P less 0.05 ) . Intensive care unit admission rate primary end point clinical outcome study . Comparisons : The objective two-arm , multisite , randomize , pivotal IDE clinical trial compare survival hospital discharge neurologic recovery rate subject receive S-CPR compare ACD-CPR+ITD follow out-of-hospital cardiac arrest well-established American emergency medical service system .</detailed_description>
