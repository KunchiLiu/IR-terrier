	<brief_title>Effectiveness Sympathetic Plexus Block Male Pelvic Pain ( Prostatitis , Prostatodynia )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Male pelvic pain common urological complaint . Oftentimes patient give diagnosis chronic prostatitis . Although term `` chronic prostatitis '' commonly associate infection , le 5 % men present pelvic pain find evidence urogenital infection common pathogen . Because etiology usually associate pain , chronic idiopathic prostatitis call male chronic pelvic pain syndrome ( CPPS ) . Options propose treatment male CPPS limit variable success rate . Although several abnormality nervous system propose possible cause CPPS , clinical nature disease suggest involvement sympathetic nervous system . The sympathetic nervous system may involve many regional pain syndrome , situation , term `` sympathetically maintain pain '' use complex regional pain syndrome . Block sympathetic nerve supply region commonly use detect sympathetic nervous system involvement . Sympathetic nerve block use clinical study involve pelvic pain study include cancer patient pelvic pain . The type sympathetic block use pelvic pain superior hypogastric plexus block involve instillation neural block agent local anesthetic agent region plexus , usually fluoroscopic control . Nociceptive afferent transmission pelvic viscera probably via superior hypogastric plexus . This treatment option systematically use male CPPS . In study , temporary block superior hypogastric plexus bupivacaine use assess degree sympathetic block electrodiagnostic test . After temporary nerve block , analgesic efficacy monitor . Therefore , study , hope explain sympathetic nature disease concrete term also propose new therapeutic approach male CPPS . Men diagnosis non-bacterial chronic pelvic pain respond treatment ask participate study . The subject randomly assign receive either active medication sympathetic plexus block placebo . All study element identical group . Visit 1 take approximately 4 hour University Washington Medical Center Urology Clinic . - First , study explain detail subject . Any question answer give study consent read sign . - Next , subject ask fill baseline questionnaire . They Demographic Questionnaire , Baseline Symptom Questionnaire , NIH Symptom Index-Baseline , AUA Symptom Score , short version Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) Pain Drawing . A sexual function questionnaire , International Index Erectile Function ( IIEF ) also administer . After complete questionnaire , subject physical neurological exam . - Blood draw : An 20 gauge needle insert antecubital vein fix tape . The subject lie examination table 20 minute approximately 10 cc blood drawn , via needle , used baseline plasma catecholamine , corticosteroid acetylcholine level . Plasma catecholamine measurement biochemical parameter evaluate sympathetic nervous system . Corticosteroids stress-related hormone acetylcholine important neurotransmitter relate autonomic nervous system . - We next ask patient stand . After stand 5 minute , another 10cc blood drawn needle remove . This blood use measure hormonal parameter , , nervous system activate stand . - Prostate massage rectal/prostate exam : The subject undergo rectal prostate examination massage prostate expression prostatic fluid . The subject ask come full bladder ask urinate 5 cc small container . He ask urinate 20 cc second container save rest bladder . The subject undergo rectal examination prostate massage possible obtain express prostatic secretion tip penis . The subject ask urinate third time approximately 10 cc sterile container . Specimens use microbiologic biochemical study . - Semen analysis : We ask subject provide semen sample masturbation . A private room , lockable door , provide purpose . - Some specimen collect visit save future use possible biochemical study . These study available investigator involve study give one else . If future , deemed investigator scientifically clinically valuable , specimen may use genetic test gene make one susceptible pelvic pain syndrome prostatitis . If genetic test ever consider future , subject contact asked sign another consent form . The consent state exact nature test clearly explain do . - Electrodiagnostic test : These test evaluate sympathetic nervous system tone also sensations several part body include genital area . The first electrodiagnostic test involve battery control instrument call Episcan . It measure skin conductivity response several site body . We apply test penis , scrotum , genital area , perineum , hand foot . It painless non-invasive test require stimulation . - The second part electrodiagnostic test involve use another battery control instrument call Neurometer . This painless procedure detect localizes abnormality sensation several body part . We apply test foot , hand , penis , scrotum , genital area perineum . Three different type stimuli different frequency deliver determine sensory threshold area test . - The third test measurement temperature sensation painful area , perineum leave hand . In order measure temperature sensation , small probe capable change temperature place area . The ability discriminate temperature change determine well subjective discomfort produce temperature change . A computer assist device call Thermal Sensory Analyzer use purpose . - Then , subject sympathetic skin response evoke cavernous activity measurement . These test reflect state sympathetic nervous system evaluate body part . The subject supine position throughout . Two 28 ga. concentric needle electrode place side penis . Six surface electrode place penile skin , scrotum , perineum abdominal skin record electrode . Eight surface electrode place back inner side foot hand . After electrode place , spontaneous electrical activity record 5 minute . After obtain spontaneous surface needle electrode recording , right wrist ( median nerve ) stimulate small amount current . Median nerve stimulation routine method use stimulate nervous system order record electrical skin response . After stimulation median nerve , evoked response acquire exist electrode . The stimulus median nerve repeat . - After test , electrodes take two needle electrode use penis inserted cremasteric muscle side . These muscle surround vessel supply testicle . Then , inner side right thigh stimulate small amount current evoke cremasteric muscle reflex . This reflex show state sympathetic nerve supply testicle scrotum . These test useful assess degree sympathetic nerve blockage compare test instillation . - At end visit , subject give void diary plastic urinal . We ask measure record urine output 3 consecutive day come week . VISIT 2 take approximately 4 hour University Washington Medical Center Urology Clinic . - In visit , subject take fluoroscopy unit Urology clinic . The subject lie prone position receive subcutaneous injection 1 % lidocaine without epinephrine . - Then , radiologic guidance , two needle ( 22-G Chiba ) place via bilateral posterior approach tip needle lie anterior L5/S1 vertebra . Placement needle monitor closely order avoid anatomical structure . The exact location needle confirm injection radiopaque solution ( Isovue-200 ) fluoroscopy . After ensure correct needle placement , 0.5 % levobupivacaine , 10ml inject needle study group 0.9 % NaCl solution , 10ml control group . Routine monitoring ( ECG/blood pressure , pulse oximetry ) use throughout procedure 30 minute procedure . - One hour follow procedure , blood draw , urine collection ( without prostate massage ) electrodiagnostic test first visit repeat order ass degree block . The subject give another copy void diary fill next week . VISIT 3 take 4 hour take place one week follow procedure . The sympathetic blockage assess side effect sexual void function physical neurological examination . The pain questionnaires NIH SX-Follow/up , AUA-Symptom Score , IIEF , PSS Pain Drawing electrodiagnostic test repeat .</detailed_description>
