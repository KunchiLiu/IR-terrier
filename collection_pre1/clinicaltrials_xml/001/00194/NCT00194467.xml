	<brief_title>Suppression Oral HHV8 Shedding With Valganciclovir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study use valganciclovir define role antiviral therapy suppression HHV-8 shed HHV-8 seropositive men . Our hypothesis valganciclovir substantially reduce frequency detection amount HHV-8 mouth . Such reduction serve confirm mouth site active HHV-8 replication . If valganciclovir find effective , finding proposal would serve basis clinical trial valganciclovir prevention Kaposi 's Sarcoma ( KS ) high-risk HHV-8 seropositive person . After informed consent , subject undergo medical history , physical examination screen laboratory examination . Eligible patient return clinic randomization receiver either valganciclovir 900 mg qd placebo . Participants receive diary note adverse event concurrent medication . The clinician instruct participant collection mouth swabs provide Dacron swab , vial PCR medium pre-printed label . Subjects ask obtain swab oral mucosa every morning . Clinic visit every week serve review interim medical history diary adverse event , collect PCR swab , dispense additional medication draw safety lab . The study use double-blind , randomize placebo design . Therefore , participant know whether take placebo active medication time study .
