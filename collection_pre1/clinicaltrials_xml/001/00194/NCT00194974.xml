	<brief_summary>This project clinical study woman high blood pressure become pregnant . Preeclampsia syndrome develop end pregnancy characterize abrupt rise blood pressure ( BP ) , blood clot kidney dysfunction , may result premature delivery , infant death , maternal bleeding , kidney failure stroke . The goal determine whether lower blood pressure normal pressure 120/80 associate low incidence preeclampsia . Women completely healthy 5 % chance develop preeclampsia , however woman preexist high blood pressure 25 % chance complication . Several study , include suggest high blood pressure early pregnancy ( &lt; 20 week ) associate even high risk preeclampsia . Currently , researcher Weill Medical College Cornell University , know treat woman high blood pressure and/or kidney disease pregnancy . Keeping BP normal range may beneficial mother . On hand , sure blood pressure lower medication may may adverse effect baby . Different trial answer question perform clear conclusion . Because uncertainty , propose compare two different strategy treat woman high BP become pregnant . We treat half woman BP medication normalize BP ( 120-130/80 mm Hg ) ( experimental group ) half goal keep BP slightly high ( 140-150/90-100 mm Hg ) ( standard therapy group ) . We determine approach result healthy pregnancy , low incidence preeclampsia . Reducing incidence preeclampsia would significant benefit mother baby .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Targets Chronic Hypertension Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : This pilot study examine feasibility conducting large , multi center randomize control trial . Fifty woman chronic hypertension pregnant see first trimester pregnancy recruit office obstetricians New York Presbyterian Hospital . Recruitment : First trimester ( 13 6/7th week ) Stratified : - Parity ( primiparous vs. multiparous deliver fetus &gt; 20 week gestation ) - Severity hypertension ( &gt; 150/95 ) determine screen antepartum visit Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Pregnant patient evaluate recruitment 13 6/7 week gestation . 2 . Age 18-50 3 . Patients include consideration enter trial office blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mm Hg : systolic &gt; 140 mm Hg , diastolic &gt; 90 mm Hg . The average 3 reading take minimum 5 minute apart record baseline blood pressure . 4 . Patients also include consideration enter trial know longstanding hypertension diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) &gt; 90 within 2 year index pregnancy and/or antihypertensive medication , regardless in-office blood pressure see first trimester . Exclusion Criteria : Significant target organ damage ; patient 's initial antepartum visit , routine serum creatinine urine dipstick protein perform attend obstetrician . If patient hypertensive history 5 year , screen electrocardiogram perform . These review result preclude participation trial . 1 . Known renal disease creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dl 2 . Proteinuria &gt; 500 mg/day baseline 3 . Left ventricular hypertrophy electrocardiography ( ECG ) criterion . 4 . History follow : chronic illness require immunosuppression , well secondary cause hypertension : pheochromocytoma , hyperaldosteronism , coarctation aorta , renal artery stenosis revascularized . NB : presence condition would make likely clinician would treat blood pressure pregnancy . Therefore , patient may randomize treatment begin per protocol prior complete evaluation presence condition ; exclusion criterion subsequently identify patient would exclude treated accord individual physician standard practice . Enrollment : Patients undergo initial baseline evaluation . History physical performed . Weight , height blood pressure record . Eligible patient sign inform consent . Each patient data sheet purpose record study result . Randomization : Patients randomize one two blood pressure target : 120-130/80-85 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90-100 mm Hg Randomization occur block randomization block 6 . Randomization stratify parity ( nulliparous vs. multiparous ) severe vs. non-severe hypertension . There therefore 4 potential group : 1 . Nulliparous + non-severe hypertension 2 . Multiparous + non-severe hypertension 3 . Nulliparous + severe hypertension 4 . Multiparous + severe hypertension There 54 envelope group ( allow theoretic possibility patient may fall one group ) envelop number open sequentially allocate patient randomization process . Treatment : Patients prior history hypertension treat per protocol describe . Patients known history hypertension still randomize appropriate group accord parity blood pressure clinic , ask stop antihypertensive medication wash period . The patient return clinic three seven day later medication repeat blood pressure measurement . If home blood pressure monitor calibrate office equipment , may take blood pressure home . They treat per randomization group i.e . blood pressure 120-130/80-85 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90-100 mm Hg per protocol . The patient give diary record obstetric data blood pressure data . Duplicate record keep patient physician . Weight , blood pressure , pulse , presence absence edema urinary protein record visit . Medication Protocol : Treatment commence immediately randomization unless patient undergo washout period describe . Some patient initially require medication BP 's may treatment threshold , depend treatment group . Treatment methyldopa , labetolol , long act nifedipine , hydralazine clonidine . Scheduled Visits : Patients follow every two four week delivery . Medication titrate achieve desire blood pressure target . Patients bill visit . The achievement target blood pressure assess average three blood pressure measurement obtain every six week visit : week 20 , 26 , 32 38 . At 20 week visit , routine blood work drawn evaluate uric acid plasma renin activity validation prediction algorithm . Home Blood Pressure Monitoring : If patient home blood pressure monitor , ask bring clinic calibration . They give blood pressure diary record home blood pressure monitor BP measurement do another clinic pharmacy . Duration Treatment : The treatment goal 120-130/80 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90 mm Hg apply time randomization delivery . Postpartum , clinician choose blood pressure goal per JNC-7 guideline . Assessment Outcomes : For pilot trial , maternal blood pressure primary outcome . This measured week 20 , 26 , 32 , 36 use standardize method : 15 minute rest , blood pressure measure woman seat , arm support heart level , bladder cuff encircle &gt; 80 % arm circumference phase V Korotkoff use diastolic reading . Blood pressure record three time , five minute apart , mean value allow assessment BP control study . Secondary outcome : 1 . The incidence superimpose preeclampsia chronically hypertensive woman . Diagnosis superimpose preeclampsia make follow criterion : - Worsening hypertension 20 week - AND proteinuria &gt; .3g/day 24 hour collection previously none OR double proteinuria , positive baseline - AND/OR HELLP syndrome ( hemolysis blood smear , liver transaminase level &gt; 2 x normal , low platelet &lt; 100/mm3 ) . 2 . Gestational age 3 . Birth weight &lt; 10th centile gestational age 4 . Serious perinatal complication include neonatal death , respiratory distress , intraventricular hemorrhage , hypotension , bradycardia , maternal complication eclampsia , stroke , end organ failure , cesarean section . Preterm admission , severe hypertension indication delivery also evaluate .</detailed_description>
