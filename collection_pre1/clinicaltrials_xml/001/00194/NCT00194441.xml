In second phase study adult study extend child determine critical threshold CPP child follow brain injury base outcome 3 , 6 , 12 month . The primary outcome measure GOS 12 month post-injury . The GOS , Behavior Rating Inventory Executive Function , PedsQOL also assess 3 , 6 , &amp; 12 month , Adaptive Behavior Assessment System 3 6 month post-injury . In addition , researcher examine variability complexity physiologic measure , blood pressure , record intensive care unit stay adult child enrol study .

	<detailed_description>Prevention reduction secondary brain injury key component critical care management patient variety brain insult . Current clinical management emphasize maintain cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) 70 mm Hg minimize secondary brain injury . However , due poor ergonomics clinical monitoring display likely short episode decrease CPP miss attend nurse course necessary patient repositioning , suction , routine therapeutic activity . Given crucial role neuronal perfusion prevent secondary injury beyond original brain insult , refine nurse 's ability visualize manage CPP moment-to-moment basis may allow measurable improvement short long-term patient functional outcome . Computer interfaces provide highly visible information CPP randomly allocate intensive care unit bed patient close head injury ( CHI ) subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) intracranial pressure monitor arterial line place medical management , stratify primary diagnosis ( CHI SAH ) severity . Continuous data collect 150 patient 150 patient without interface monitor duration CPP monitoring . The primary hypothesis test Glasgow Outcome Score ( GOS ) 6 month acute care discharge significantly well monitor continuous CPP display . Secondary endpoint GOS discharge 3 month discharge , Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) score discharge , Functional Status examination 3 6 month . The percentage CPP set level hospital monitoring determine . No CPP threshold establish adequately predict well child survive brain injury . Thus describe association various CPP thresholds child 's outcome one year brain injury . The target number child enrol 65 . Studies suggest regularity variability physiologic measure , example , heart rate , may give information well system respond challenge . Changes variability may associate disease . Describing physiologic variability may therefore useful identify critically ill individual brain injury less able adapt challenge may great risk brain injury poorer outcome . Measures value individual place various health state use calculate quality adjust life year ass cost-effectiveness treatment . While measure develop assess individual value different outcome , information regard value place outcome follow brain injury lack . We use measure carry interview brain injury survivor brain injury add knowledge area .</detailed_description>
