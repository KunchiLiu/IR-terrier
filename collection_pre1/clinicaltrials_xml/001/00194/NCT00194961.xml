	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : The energy cost growth increase experimental CKD . Caloric intake show correlate height velocity child CKD , calorie supplementation clearly show improve height velocity child dialysis . However , energy intake exceed 75 % recommend allowance , growth improvement occur . Circulating concentration cytokine , leptin , tumor necrosis factor-alpha interleukin 1 6 increase patient CKD . In light increase recognition growth hormone receptor signal involves cytokine pathway activation , hypothesize maladaptation cytokine regulation CKD may underlie growth failure . Secondly , hypothesize administration recombinant human growth hormone ( rhGH ) result growth rate stimulation pre-pubertal child growth impairment due CKD regulation cytokine pathway . Specific Aims : This investigation 's primary objective evaluate biochemical/metabolic , immunologic parameter relation body composition pre- post-rhGH therapy . The secondary objective examine efficacy rhGH improve growth velocity prepubertal , rhGH naïve , child growth failure secondary CKD . The safety rhGH assess measure parameter , addition identify increase incidence slip capital femoral epiphysis , increase progression underlie renal disease . Methods Procedure : This open-label study evaluate efficacy safety recombinant human growth hormone child chronic kidney disease growth failure . The study involve obtain follow : 1 . Medical History Physical Examination : Subjects complete medical history potential conditions/medications , might affect linear growth , growth velocity , responsiveness rhGH . A complete physical examination perform , include Tanner Staging , accurate measurement stand height ( recumbent length , &lt; 3 year age ) use stadiometer ( triplicate ) , weight ( triplicate ) , blood pressure funduscopic examination refer Center . Anthropometric measurement make Body Composition Unit St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center , New York , NY . 2 . Routine lab include CBC ( Hgb/ Hct ) , BUN , creatinine , liver function study , albumin . 3 . Bone Age 4 . Leptin 5 . Cytokines measure include IL-6 , TNF alpha , TNFsR , Rp55 ( type1 ) , IL-1beta , IL-1Ra . The ratio IL-1 IL-1Ra measure intracellular extracellular IL-1b compare extracellular IL-Ra measure circulation produce vitro , spontaneously response activation . TNF alpha level production intracellularly extracellularly compare TNFsRp55 ( type 1 ) 6 . Insulin 7 . GH-IGF Axis Proteins 8 . Body Composition DXA During two year study , anticipate 15 eligible subject receive rhGH 0.05 mg/kg daily subcutaneous injection . This estimate patient enrollment base upon preliminary data experience incidence , age onset CKD , anticipated change therapy patient receive transplant . The dose calculate base initial weight adjust need every three month accord weight . A parent legal guardian administer dose home appropriate training . Following treatment 6 month termination study , patient remain eligible due persistent growth retardation , receive daily rhGH standard care therapy institution growth rate follow . During course study study subject continue medical management follow-up CKD prescribe Pediatric Nephrologist . Subjects may require concomitant medication erythropoietin , calcium supplement , sodium bicarbonate/sodium citrate , phosphate binder , calcitriol , and/or antihypertensive part on-going management . After baseline assessment ( Time 0 ) , study subject enter six-month observation phase . Medical history , physical examination , biochemical study , creatinine clearance glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , Hgb/Hct , Glucose Tolerance test ( GTT ) insulin measurement , GH-IGF axis protein , cytokine leptin study obtain Time 0 , +3 month , +6 month . At Time 0 end six month observation , study subject also undergo body composition evaluation ( DXA ) total two set study . Bone age assess time point well . Each patient serve his/her control Time 0 measurement . Historical growth data obtain back far six month , , possible .</detailed_description>
