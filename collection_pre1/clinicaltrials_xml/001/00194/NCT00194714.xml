	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect vaccine therapy see well work treat patient stage IV major histocompatibility complex , class I , A2 antigen ( HLA-A2 ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) positive breast ovarian cancer receive trastuzumab . Giving booster vaccine make HER2 peptide may help increase HER2 specific immunity immune memory cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV HLA-A2 HER2 Positive Breast Ovarian Cancer Receiving Trastuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety administer HER2 cytotoxic T-cell ( CTL ) peptide-based vaccine ( HER-2/neu peptide vaccine ) stage IV breast ovarian cancer patient receive maintenance trastuzumab . II . To quantify characterize antigen specific T cell subset specific HER2 peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) patient vaccination HER2 CTL peptide-based vaccine receive maintenance trastuzumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient complete vaccination series HER2 CTL peptide-based vaccine receive maintenance trastuzumab . OUTLINE : Patients receive HER-2/neu peptide vaccine intradermally ( ID ) per month 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month , yearly 5 year .</detailed_description>
