	<brief_summary>Of 2 million Americans heart failure ( HF ) , 70 % disturbed sleep worsens dyspnea , fatigue , reduce daytime function associate HF . Exercise improve sleep healthy people effect exercise test patient HF . A control , randomize trial propose compare effect 16 week usual activity ( control ) 16 week regular , supervise walk exercise ( treatment ) , cardiac function sleep . Approximately 170 subject NYHA Class I , II , III stable heart failure recruit . Subjects treatment group walk exercise 5 time week 30 minute . The purpose randomized trial examine effect 16 week regular walk exercise cardiac function , sleep , quality life person stable New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class I , II III heart failure . The specific aim : 1 . To compare physiologic measure cardiac function ( peak oxygen utilization , exercise capacity , nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturations , heart rate variability ) self-reported quality life ( i.e. , symptoms dyspnea fatigue , ability perform activity daily live ) patient randomize walk vs. control condition . 2 . To compare somnographic ( sleep fragmentation , slow wave sleep , sleep efficiency ) self-reported ( sleep effectiveness , sleep disturbance , nap supplementation ) measure sleep HF patient randomize walk vs. control condition . 3 . Considering extent apnea-hypopnea episode study entry group assignment ( walk vs. control ) , explore whether HF patient frequent apnea-hypopnea episode ( 20 per hour ) walk group experience great pretest-posttest improvement physiologic cardiac somnographic function , compare HF patient apnea-hypopnea episode ( less 20 per hour ) assign walk , control group HF patient frequent apnea-hypopnea episode . HYPOTHESES : 1 . Heart failure patient walk regularly well cardiac function control group . Heart failure patient walk regularly high self-reported quality life , less shortness breath/fatigue , great ability perform activity daily live control group . 2 . Heart failure patient walk regularly well sleep control group . 3 . Heart failure patient frequent episode slow stop breathe sleep walk regularly great improvement pretest-posttest measure cardiac function heart failure patient episodes slow stop breathe sleep walk regularly , control group frequent breathe difficulty sleep . Heart failure patient frequent apnea-hypopnea episode walk regularly great improvement ( i.e. , large difference ) pretest-posttest somnographic sleep measure efficient , fragmented , slow wave sleep , heart failure patient apnea-hypopnea episode walk regularly , control group frequent apnea-hypopnea episode .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PROCEDURES . Walking Exercise Intervention . An individualized program walking exercise prescribe ( walk 5 time week 30 minute session ) . The protocol walk intervention base exercise program adapt 12 research protocol patient NYHA Class II-III heart failure , one cardiac rehabilitation protocol use approximately 20 year ; AHCPR Clinical Practice Guidelines activity prescription heart failure patient . The walking exercise prescription base modify Naughton treadmill test 6-minute walk test , conduct part eligibility screen use pretest measure . The target exercise heart rate range calculate peak heart rate ( measure treadmill peak oxygen utilization ) minus rest heart rate , multiply 40 % 60 % , plus rest heart rate . Weekly 6 week , every week 10 week , research nurse make visit initiate , monitor , advance individualized program walking exercise . POPULATION . Our target population person diagnose heart failure ( HF ) . Pretest posttest measure include exercise tolerance test ; two night somnographic sleep oxygen saturation recording ; one 24-hour record heart rate variability ; subjective report quality life . One-way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use test control-treatment group difference cardiac function ( Aim 1 ) sleep ( Aim 2 ) . Interaction examine two-way ANOVA group ( HF subject frequent vs. apnea-hypopnea episode walk vs.control ) time ( condition ) determine whether HF subject frequent apnea-hypopnea episode exercise good outcome HF subject apnea-hypopnea episode exercise , control group ( Aim 3 ) .</detailed_description>

They could Class I ( symptom ) originally diagnose NYHA Class II III respond treatment . Patients must evidence least one clinical episode HF diagnose physician nurse practitioner fatigue , shortness breath , pulmonary congestion . Patients stable HF ( define hospitalization 3 mo , medication change 1 mo , dyspnea rest , sustain rest heart rate great 95 bpm ) . Patients consider ineligible study base follow criterion obtain patient 's physician nurse practitioner : Diagnosed Pickwickian syndrome , extreme variant sleep apnea characterize severe obesity , respiratory insufficiency , biventricular failure ; Known obstructive sleep apnea ; Unstable angina , myocardial infarction , cardiac surgery 3 mo prior study entry ; Aortic stenosis ; Routine use theophylline ; Kyphoscoliosis ( spinal curvature ) extent chest abdominal band use sleep recording could keep place ; Receiving antidepressant therapy ; Cardiac transplant recipient ; Psychiatric diagnose manic depression , dementia , depression ; Inability walk without assistance ; Inability speak/read English ; Known atrial fibrillation ; Current use nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) oxygen therapy ; Already participate exercise program meeting exceed level activity study .</criteria>
