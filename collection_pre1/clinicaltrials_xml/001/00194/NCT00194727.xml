	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study examine safety effectiveness combination therapy consist daily oral capecitabine weekly intravenous vinorelbine stage IV breast cancer subject . The study design assess safety effectiveness combination therapy . Safety assess analyze type toxicity , severity toxicity need dose modification delay due toxicity . Effectiveness assess analyze response rate , time treatment failure , time progression overall survival . Our hypothesis regimen effective standard historic regimen type stage cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weekly Vinorelbine Oral Capecitabine Treatment Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-agent chemotherapy rarely curative advance breast cancer . Combination regimens next logical step attempt improve tumor response rate prolong survival . Oral capecitabine convenient way deliver drug 5-fluorouracil analogue . In addition , vinorelbine newer vinca alkaloid chemotherapeutic agent improve efficacy probably improve toxicity predecessor treatment breast cancer . We propose combine two agent . As two drug non-overlapping toxicity differ mechanisms action , anticipate able deliver drug near full dose . Secondary purpose include assess whether correlation intra-tumoral enzyme level prognosis .</detailed_description>
