	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate feasibility toxicity treatment 12 week Adriamycin daily oral Cytoxan G-CSF support follow 12 week Taxol . Feasibility assess compare deliver dose intensity drug deliver dose intensity previous trial . Toxicity assess compare incidence severity toxicity drug previous trial use drug combination . We hypothesize metronomic , dose dense treatment give study less toxic effective historical regimen use drug less metronomic , dose dense manner .</brief_summary>
