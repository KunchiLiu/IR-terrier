	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give hormone therapy together combination chemotherapy surgery work treat patient stage I-IIIA breast cancer . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use exemestane triptorelin pamoate may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , methotrexate , vinorelbine ditartrate , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving hormone therapy together combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pathologic response rate patient operable breast cancer treat two part , neoadjuvant regimen consist complete hormonal blockade ( CHB ) 2 week follow four three-week cycle Xeloda , Methotrexate Navelbine continuation complete hormonal blockade . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical response rate patient surgically resectable breast cancer treat complete hormonal blockade four three-week cycle Xeloda , Methotrexate Navelbine . II . To assess toxicity associate regimen . III . To assess relapse rate , overall disease-free survival patient operable breast cancer treat neoadjuvant CHB XMN + CHB follow adjuvant treatment use XMN Taxol . IV . To assess whether phenotype breast cancer change treatment . V. To assess whether phenotypic change breast tumor predict outcome . OUTLINE : NEOADJUVANT CHB : Patients receive exemestane orally ( PO ) daily 14 week . Premenopausal patient also receive triptorelin pamoate intramuscularly ( IM ) monthly 4 month begin 2 week initiation exemestane . NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive capecitabine PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 methotrexate intravenously ( IV ) vinorelbine ditartrate IV 6-10 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . SURGERY : Patients undergo definitive surgical resection without radiation therapy . ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients microscopic complete response ( pCR ) disease down-staged = &lt; 1 cm positive node receive capecitabine PO BID day 1-14 methotrexate IV vinorelbine ditartrate IV 6-10 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . Patients down-staged T 0 1 positive node receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly 12 week . ADJUVANT HORMONAL THERAPY : Patients receive hormonal therapy 5 year . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
