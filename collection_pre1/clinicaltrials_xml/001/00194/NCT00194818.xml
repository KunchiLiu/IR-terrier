	<brief_title>Asacol Dosing Study Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan perform open label , efficacy safety pilot study Asacol ( mesalamine product ) mild moderately active ulcerative colitis . An investigator , confirm diagnosis ulcerative colitis review medical record potentially eligible patient . At least one week prior enrollment , potentially eligible patient evaluate score Ulcerative colitis clinical activity index ( UCAI ) . This index incorporate eight item : stool frequency , blood stool , general well , abdominal pain , fever , extra-intestinal manifestation , sedimentation rate hemoglobin . Scores range 0-32 . A score 4 index consider clinically significant . A total score 4-12 represent mild moderate activity colitis . A routine clinic visit schedule entry , time standard physical examination , stool sample evaluate infection blood test perform . Base-line demographic information , score UCAI , data medication use obtain visit . Quality life measure one week prior randomization Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire , previously validate instrument four part ( bowel function , emotional status , systemic symptom , social function ) ; total score index range 32 224 , high score indicate good quality life . The score patient remission usually range 170 190 . One half enrol study , start Asacol 6 tablet BID ( 4.8 grams/day ) . The half patient enrol start Asacol 4 tablet TID ( 4.8 grams/day ) . If patient tolerate start dose titrate reach tolerable dose . During first 6 week study medication hold stable dos . Patients see week 2 symptom evaluation undergo standard physical exam basic laboratory test . At week 4 patient evaluate undergo standard physical examination , standard blood test perform . All patient ask provide stool sample visit 1 final visit , measure fecal lactoferrin , provide objective measure inflammation colon . At week 6 disease modify medication may use alter accordingly . All patient see week 8 2 week consider study failure ( i.e . patient drop week 2 would see week 4 ) re-evaluation symptom . At week 12 patient fail show improvement , achieve remission require medication , consider fail study . Participants achieve remission , define UCAI 4 response define reduction CAI score less 4 , consider respond medication . The primary outcome measure trial presence clinical improvement week 12 , define decrease UCAI score 4 . The proportion patient arm achieve clinical response arm trial compare . The proportion patient arm achieve remission therapy measure reduction UCAI score le 4 examined secondary outcome measure . Other secondary outcome include improvement Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( IBDQ ) score , time clinical response , self-reported patient satisfaction , patient compliance base pill count , time failure . The number patient arm require addition disease modify medication evaluate . The primary endpoint adjust disease modify agent significant difference group use medication , power may limit base sample size study . The proportion patient achieve clinical remission response arm compare use Fisher 's exact test . Comparisons continuous variable UCAI score IBDQ score perform use non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test . Because goal propose study generate pilot data support large randomize trial , power detect clinically important difference two dosing regimen limit . Assuming 75 % rate clinical remission TID group , propose sample size 10 patient per group allow u detect 25 % decrease rate remission BID group . As open label study , investigator access clinical information concern adverse event response rate throughout study . We assess safety efficacy difference two group 5 patient randomized arm . Should 20 % ( n=2 ) patient develop serious adverse event necessitate discontinuation Asacol , study stop . In addition , halt study great 40 % difference efficacy treatment group midway point trial .</detailed_description>
