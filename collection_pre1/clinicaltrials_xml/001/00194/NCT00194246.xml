	<brief_title>Cognitive Function Cue-Reactivity Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants recruit parent study The Safety Efficacy Low High Carbohydrate Diets . Participants attend one 30-minute training session learn computer task rate food desirability . Participants rate desire eat `` 24 '' food `` 9 '' -point Likert scale ( e.g. , 1 = desire ; 5 = neutral , neither desire desire ; 9 = desire extremely ) . These rating use establish emotionally salient neutral cue computerize test ( i.e. , Cue Reactivity Stroop test ) use study . Each individual participate separate occasion one 45-60 minute test session onset treatment ( week 0 ) , four 45-60 minute test session coincide treatment assessment approve study ( week 12 , 26 , 54 ) . Testing conduct one half hour follow consumption standard snack ensure participant metabolic state . Participants complete three consecutive computerized test follow order : 1 ) Continual Performance Test ( CPT ) , 2 ) Stroop test , 3 ) Cue Reactivity Test . Based previous study show impairment cognitive function one week initiation low carbohydrate diet , participant also complete 5-minute cognitive task ( e.g. , Continual Performance Task ) one four week modification eat begin . On week , participant give small snack prior group meeting . Testing occur conclusion weekly group meeting , ensure participant abstain food approximately one half hour . The 15 minute cue reactivity test consist three cue trial vary term cue present ( one neutral non-food cue , one neutral food cue , one emotionally salient food cue ) . The order trial present counter-balanced order.Participants complete VAS questionnaire , rating feeling hunger , craving , anxiety . Participants insert dental roll prior three , five-minute cue-presentation trial . While participant insert dental roll , experimenter place relevant cue platter . This platter divider/ barrier attached obstructs cue participant 's view experimenter room . After roll insert cue place platter , experimenter leave room , rotate platter via remote control cue clear view participant.5-minute psychophysiologic data ( i.e. , heart rate , skin conductance ) acquisition begin platter rotate . Participants instruct via audiotape focus attention cue , imagine picking , smell , taste , etc . At end 5-minute interval , blood pressure measure taken.Participants remove dental roll place plastic zip-lock bag.The experimenter return room ask participant complete post-trial VAS questionnaire , rating feeling hunger , craving , anxiety . Then participant provide one ounce water .</detailed_description>
