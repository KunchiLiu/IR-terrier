	<brief_summary>The main objective propose research study determine efficacy [ 18-F ] Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) differentiate infection complication loosen patient painful joint prosthesis . We intend validate establish necessary criterion make diagnosis determine accuracy technique comparison exist modality white blood image patient outcome . We expect completion propose research , role novel powerful image modality clearly define management patient challenge serious complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FDG-PET Imaging Painful Joint Prosthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study : 1 . To determine normal pattern FDG uptake demonstrate pet two year follow total joint replacement surgery 2 . To establish optimal diagnostic criterion differentiate septic aseptic painful joint prosthesis FDG-PET imaging determine accuracy 3 . To compare accuracy FDG-PET image conventional technique differentiation septic aseptic painful joint prosthesis . We intend enroll 100 patient per year 5 year . These patient select 300 case undergo joint revision collaborate institution . After patient undergoes appropriate evaluation include history , physical examination , radiographic laboratory evaluation , he/she assign one group list base degree suspicion infectious process . Every effort make approximately one-third patient recruit follow group . Study Plan Study I : FDG-PET image painful partial total joint prosthesis We intend enroll 100 patient per year 5 year . These patient select 300 case undergo joint revision collaborate institution . After patient undergoes appropriate evaluation include history , physical examination , radiographic laboratory evaluation , he/she assign one group list base degree suspicion infectious process . Every effort make approximately one-third patient recruit follow group . Group 1 : Low pre-scan suspicion infection . The incidence infection base past experience &lt; 10 % population . Group 2 : High pre-scan suspicion infection . The incidence infection group quite high base past experience . Group 3 : Intermediate pre-scan suspicion infection . Criteria : Any patient fit either group 1 2 consider category . The incidence infection group base past experience intermediate . Considering large number patient undergo joint revision ( 300 annually ) participate institution combine , expect difficulty recruit adequate number 3 category . Each patient undergo one preoperative diagnostic FDG-PET scan . After PET scan complete , diagnosis detailed description observation make communicate attend surgeon operation . We believe information enable investigator establish correct diagnosis surgical intervention . Study II : FDG-PET imaging follow uncomplicated partial total joint arthroplasty To accomplish goal , enroll 10 patient per year first 3 year . FDG-PET scan perform approximately 12 month , 18 month and/or 2 year follow surgery . All scan occur within 2 month 12- , 18- , and/or 24-month anniversary patient 's recent joint replacement surgery . It unknown long FDG uptake persists uncomplicated partial total joint arthroplasty . The expected pattern FDG uptake follow arthroplasty provide basis correct diagnosis periprosthetic infection loosen life implant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients select entry study men woman ethnic background schedule undergo clinical diagnostic evaluation member Department Orthopedic Surgery Hospital University Pennsylvania Health System collaborate physician Rothman Institute VA Philadelphia Medical Center . Study I : FDGPET image painful partial total joint prosthesis Each patient candidate evaluate one collaborator mention painful partial total joint prosthesis . The patient undergo appropriate routine evaluation include history , physical examination , radiographic , scintigraphic , necessary laboratory evaluation . An initial diagnosis must make patient . The diagnosis loosen establish base clinical examination and/or radiographic evaluation demonstrate clear evidence complication . Other etiology joint pain , except infection aseptic loosening , need exclude . Surgical intervention ( prosthesis revision ) may may plan patient candidate study . Study II : FDGPET image follow uncomplicated partial total joint arthroplasty All patient fulfil criterion consider potential candidate study . Each patient must diagnosis degenerative joint disease cause osteoarthritis ( previous hip surgery ) undergone primary partial total joint arthroplasty member Department Orthopedic Surgery Hospital University Pennsylvania refer hospital . Other cause degenerative joint disease exclude physical , radiographic laboratory evaluation clinically indicate . Osteoarthritis common cause degenerative joint disease , order avoid confound factor experimental result may cause type disorder , group patient study . A patient eliminate group anytime postoperative course complicate process think influence outcome . Variations uncomplicated postoperative course determine operate surgeon include clinical sign evidence suggest infection , early loosening , process directly involve prosthesis . Patients etiologies pain , infection aseptic loosening , exclude enrollment study .</criteria>
