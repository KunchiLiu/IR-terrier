	<brief_title>FDG-PET Imaging Complicated Diabetic Foot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FDG-PET image promise imaging technique , potential overcome many shortcoming mention previously regard radiologic scintigraphic methodology . FDG diagnostic tracer utilized measure metabolic rate normal abnormal tissue . Many investigator note affinity FDG active inflammatory infectious disorder , sarcoidosis , abdominal abscess , brain abscess , lung abscess , renal abscess , inflammatory pancreatic disease , lobar pneumonia , asthma , tuberculosis , colitis , sinusitis , myositis , mastitis , vasculitis , deep venous thrombosis , thyroiditis infection include encountered orthopedic patient . According literature , accurate nuclear medicine modality detect infection associate diabetic foot label WBC method . We hypothesize FDG-PET imaging several advantage method . Detection infection label WBC image base upon assumption administer cell migrate site infection . Since majority label leukocyte preparation consist neutrophil , inflammatory/infectious process predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate ( acute infection ) likely yield positive result . However , infection associate diabetic foot sub-acute chronic . Consequently , dominant inflammatory cell involve monocyte lymphocyte . Therefore , label leukocyte unlikely detect chronic infection since monocyte lymphocyte label . In addition , previous treatment ( antibiotic , etc ) severely reduce chemotropic effect bacteria therefore , few leukocyte migrate infectious site , render label leukocyte method ineffective . In contrast , uptake FDG inflammatory cell reflect `` vivo labeling '' exist cell site infection soon administration compound . This would indicate FDG-PET technique might allow image substantially large population cell , reside area infection inflammation . Therefore , addition considerable simplification procedure associate label WBC method , include time require complete study , approach may provide high sensitivity diagnose infection setting . Furthermore , since FDG uptake rely upon leukocyte migration , treatment antibiotic less likely affect sensitivity delineate site infection . One possible advantage label WBC method FDG-PET imaging high serum glucose level appear adverse effect test result former technique hyperglycemia know decrease tumor cell FDG uptake . However , preliminary result indicate high glucose level negatively affect FDG uptake inflammatory cell . Based observation , FDG-PET image appear attractive alternative conventional technique detection infection . FDG-PET image offer unique tool diagnosis management diabetic foot . Through establishment appropriate diagnostic criterion , PET scan may prove highly accurate localize deep infection bone soft tissue associate complicate diabetic foot . By distinguish infection inflammation , potential become optimal diagnostic imaging technique diagnose manage patient diabetic foot . Therefore , research study design validate ability technique essential achieve goal .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The 240 patient select entry study men woman ethnic background diagnose diabetic foot disease member team Diabetes Center Department Medicine division Vascular Surgery department Surgery University Pennsylvania Health System ( Hospital University Pennsylvania ) . Study I : FDGPET image patient diabetic foot without clinical suspicion osteomyelitis deepseated tissue infection The patient must clinical diagnosis uncomplicated diabetic foot . Each patient undergo appropriate evaluation include history , physical examination , standard radiographic evaluation ( include MRI ) , grade peripheral neuropathy use Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument ( MNSI ) . Patients divide three group , correspond MNSI score 03 , 48 , 913 , classify mild , moderate , severe , respectively . We intend enroll 26 patient first two group 27 patient third . Study II : FDGPET image patient diabetic foot clinical suspicion osteomyelitis deepseated infection The patient must clinical diagnosis complicate diabetic foot . These patient suspect deepseated infection may may schedule undergo amputation debridement affect tissue . Each patient undergo appropriate evaluation include history , physical examination , radiologic examination include MRI , MNSI , vascular assessment segmental Doppler pressure pulse wave record . Patients complication foot etiology relate diabetes exclude study .</criteria>
