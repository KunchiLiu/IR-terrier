	<detailed_description>Study Duration : The duration study approximately one year ( 51 week ) , divide four phase : 1 ) Pre-study , 2 ) Baseline , 3 ) Intervention , 4 ) Maintenance . Participants orient procedure equipment pre-study phase ( first 3 week ) . During baseline intervention phase ( 24 week ) , participant undergo weight loss treatment . Participants maintain weight loss maintenance phase ( 24 week ) . Subject Recruitment Selection : Participants 80 participant ( BMI 25 43 kg/m2 ) age &gt; 21 year access personal computer ( PC ) . The anticipated gender balance study group 80 % female 20 % male . Forty participant recruit University Pennsylvania 40 St. Luke 's Hospital New York City . Participants randomly assign moderate intensive intervention ( describe ) . Research Design : This study divide four phase : Phase 1 ( Pre-study ) : Screening medical nutritional evaluation , RMR measurement , Balance Log orientation . There 3 week participant learn use BalanceLog Pro technology , include transfer information clinic ( i.e. , week -3 become familiar logging establish Balance Log Pro account , log meal activity upload data Balance Log Pro week -2 , learn use special Balance Log function add food receive feedback via email concern Balance Log Pro upload week -1 ) . In order randomize , participant need proficient use technology treatment focus induce weight loss rather learn software . Phase 2 ( Baseline ) : All participant participate weekly individual meeting dietitian ( R.D . ) 6 week . This design establish solid base study provide good start weight loss . Phase 3 ( Intervention ) : Individuals randomize either moderate intensive intervention . Paricipants moderate intervention meet individually RD per month . Individuals intensive intervention meet RD twice per month . This Phase continue 18 week - make weight loss phase study 6 month length . A second DEXA scan complete end study phase . Phase 4 ( Maintenance ) : From 6 12 month participant shift maintenance phase contact measure 9 12 month . At timepoints , participant meet individually RD . All individual use HETC tool ( MedGem , BalanceLog , BalanceLog Pro ) . Behavioral treatment base LEARN Program Weight Control Manual . Participants encourage consume low-calorie , low-fat diet ( i.e. , 30 % calorie fat , 15 % calorie protein 55 % calorie carbohydrate ) . The Balance Log , software tool , use establish calorie prescription base variety individual factor like RMR , lifestyle activity , physical activity level describe Balance Log software . 1 . Moderate Frequency . Participants condition provide information treatment program ( LEARN Manual , schedule ) use Balance Log ( version 2.1.1 professional web-based program ) log food intake activity . Participants group meet dietitian individually weekly basis first 6 week , month remain 18 week weight loss phase . During last 6 month study ( i.e. , weight maintenance phase ) , participant meet dietitian quarterly follow-up . 2 . Intensive Frequency . Participants condition provide information treatment program ( LEARN Manual , schedule ) use Balance Log ( version 2.1.1 professional web-based program ) log food intake activity . Participants group meet dietitian individually weekly basis first 6 week , biweekly remain 18 week weight loss phase . During last 6 month study ( i.e. , weight maintenance phase ) , participant meet dietitian quarterly follow-up . Program material . The material base current weight management program University Pennsylvania . Additional material develop altered reflect HealtheTech messaging ( RMR , energy balance , self-monitoring , etc. ) . HealtheTech provide support content layout ( graphic professional reproduction ) . A complete set Program Guideline material develop result study . The principal investigator develop material : • Topical outline 20 session clinician • Talking point summary session • `` What '' summaries participant • Skill builder use session • Key message sequence throughout program Assessments : The following assessment perform : Blood test . Routine blood work , include comprehensive metabolic panel , complete blood count lipid panel , perform baseline week 24 . Blood sample discard follow analysis . Waist circumference . Waist circumference measure baseline week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 38 52 . Waist circumference measure mid-point right iliac crest bottom right rib cage use Gulick measuring tape . Body composition . Body composition measure dual x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) baseline week 24 . DEXA provide estimate total body fat ( fat free mass ) bone mineral density ( hip , spine total body ) . The body composition unit perform Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) body composition laboratory locate 3550 Market , 4th floor . A urine pregnancy test give woman prior DEXA scan . Weight . Weight measure screening , baseline , treatment visit use digital scale subject dress light clothing without shoe . Height measure use stadiometer screen week 52 104 . Blood Pressure . Blood pressure measure screening , baseline week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 38 52 . On occasion , two reading take , 1 minute apart seat 5 minute . All measurement perform WEDP . Resting Metabolic Rate . The MedGem use RMR measurement . RMR measurement conduct baseline week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 38 52 . All participant RMR measure pre-study phase develop familiarization test . RMR measurement repeat opinion clinician problem result outside reasonable , Harris-Benedict ( traditional RMR prediction formula ) + 15 % range . The MINIMUM rate weight loss calculate base 10 % weight loss divide 24 week . ( Examples : 240 lb participant : 24 lb weight loss 24 week , 1 lb/week , 500 kcal deficit per day ; whereas 180 lb . participant would target 18 lbs 24 week 0.67 lbs/week daily caloric deficit 367 kcal/day ) . Caloric Budget Adjustments Based RMR : Adjustments calorie budget do monthly appropriate . Although measure RMR week 2 , calorie budget adjust time . The investigator provide recommendation number kcal/day RMR must change Individualized Energy Balance Prescription ( IEBP ) recalculate . For example , 50 kcal/day difference , may meaningful change IEBP , represent change 3 % , whereas change 150 kcal/day reasonable change recommend intake . Resting metabolic rate measure strict rest condition : 12 hour fast ( include caffeine ) 12 hour post-exercise 30 minute rest prior measurement A 2 3 minute familiarization do device rest period . Dietary Intake Activity . Individuals require log food exercise daily 6 month . They log use BalanceLog PC . One inclusion criterion daily access PC . The BalanceLog use establish Energy Balance Prescription participant . Macronutrient composition choose participant , however recommendation use relatively standard low ( &lt; 30 % ) fat diet minimum 40 % carbohydrate . BalanceLog Pro web-based program allow professional review individual ' BalanceLog record report remotely . Questionnaires . A qualitative assessment log conduct two time point ( 3 month 6 month ) . Process measure include ease frequency use , participant satisfaction , rating professional staff . Potential Risks : The program weight loss treatment present risks participant . Psychological risk include subjective distress participant regain weight . We acknowledge participant ' disappointment discus experience perspectives others regain weight . The potential risk study primarily associate assessment measure , specifically DEXA blood test . The blood test present minor risk bruising . Every effort make minimize risk include review participant ' health testing . Informed Consent : Participants recruit public service announcement , notice local newspaper , referral physician ' office three site . Applicants screen phone determine meet recruitment criterion , obvious contraindication treatment , remain interested study describe . Screenings conduct research coordinator follow write protocol . Persons appear appropriate participate schedule initial interview . In face-to-face interview , applicant inform nature requirement study , include randomization treatment condition . They provide write description study detail ask give informed consent participate assessment treatment . Candidates wish participate , meet criterion , offer referral appropriate program . Protection Participants : Risks complication reduce carefully select participant treatment . We clearly define contraindication inform participant ' primary care physician contraindication . Participants receive blood test frequent interval , result test monitor physician ensure participant safety weight loss . Both participant primary care physician make aware abnormal finding . Data keep lock file cabinet ensure confidentiality . In addition , guideline concern confidentiality group treatment session review participant initial interview first treatment session . Code number assign participant maximize anonymity enter data .</detailed_description>
