	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure , digital mammography , ultrasound , MRI , PET scan , may help find breast cancer find far disease spread . PURPOSE : This phase II/III trial study digital mammography , ultrasound , MRI , PET scan compare well find extent spread breast cancer woman newly diagnose breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Digital Mammography , Ultrasound , MRI , PET Scans Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare ability digital mammography , ultrasound , MRI , fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) depict extent index lesion within affected breast woman newly diagnose breast cancer . - Compare ability digital mammography , ultrasound , MRI , FDG-PET identify additional focus cancer affect breast . - Estimate accuracy FDG-PET predicting status axillary lymph node , use sentinel node sample gold standard . - Determine whether diffuse multifocal cancer detect MRI , ultrasound , digital mammography , FDG-PET predict base mammographic , clinical , pathologic finding . - Based correlation various image technique clinical pathological finding , generate profile patient risk mammographically clinically occult , diffuse multifocal disease . - Collect pilot data accuracy digital tomosynthesis determine extent breast cancer ( woman consent contrast-enhanced tomosynthesis study ) . OUTLINE : This prospective study . Patients stratify accord breast density ( fatty v scattered/less 50 % dense v heterogeneously dense/greater 50 % dense v extremely dense ) , presentation ( palpable abnormality vs image abnormality ) , image finding ( density v calcification ) . Patients undergo MRI , ultrasound , digital mammography , fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography . Results image compare panel physician determine efficacy method . Consenting patient also undergo digital tomosynthesis without contrast enhancement . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 400 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
