	<brief_summary>This study assess effect weight loss sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) 120 obese , type 2 diabetic obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) four Look AHEAD sit . Changes SDB compare subject randomize weight loss ( Lifestyle Intervention Group ) versus non-weight loss ( Diabetes Education Support Group ) condition within context Look AHEAD Study . Weight loss frequently recommend obese patient OSA , empirical foundation recommendation well substantiate . Weight loss obese apneics improves eliminate SDB . Moreover , degree improvement correlate amount weight loss . This study assess SDB treatment 1 2 year . We also investigate clinical measure fat distribution may mediate non-linear relationship weight loss improvement SDB . Finally , examine role SDB mediating change blood pressure associate weight loss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration study 5 year ; participant enrol study total 2 year . Recruitment base protocol set forth large Look AHEAD trial occur 8 treatment wave , space approximately 4 month apart . Each wave Penn site include 40 people , make potential subject pool approximately 320 person . Participants Penn site approximately 44 men woman , 45 75 year age , body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 25 kg/m2 . All subject obese type 2 diabetic randomly assign Lifestyle Intervention Group Diabetes Education Support Group Look AHEAD Study . Therefore , inclusion exclusion criterion determine parent study . Patients currently treat OSA ( e.g. , continuous positive airway pressure ) surgical treatment OSA exclude . Patients previously diagnose OSA treat include . These 44 individual represent subset approximately 320 person treat University Pennsylvania site . As part baseline visit ( randomization ) Look AHEAD study , Look AHEAD participant ask sign consent form screening . Consenting participant complete Multivariate Apnea Prediction Form . The MAP include weight , height , age 3 question sleep-related symptom . After prescreen consent complete , Research Coordinator invite participant complete consent form study . Interested subject schedule meet study 's Research Coordinator subject 's next scheduled Look AHEAD visit . Participants wish enroll undergo baseline assessment schedule baseline sleep study . Subjects pay $ 50 sleep assessment . After completion baseline sleep study , result analyze . Thirty subject baseline RDI &gt; 15 28 subject RDI 5 15 ( 5 &lt; RDI &lt; 15 ) continue study , undergoing assessment year 1 2 . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) syndrome characterize frequent cessation airflow sleep ( despite continue respiratory effort ) cause closure pharyngeal airway . The frequently use metric describe OSA respiratory disturbance index ( RDI ) ( sometimes refer apnea-hypopnea index AHI ) . RDI define average number apnea/hypopnea event per hour sleep . The medical consequence OSA include increase risk hypertension , stroke , myocardial infarction , premature mortality . The behavioral psychosocial consequence OSA include excessive daytime sleepiness , depression , sexual dysfunction , 3-7 fold increase risk motor vehicle accident . Among 30 60 year old , 9 % woman 24 % men general population RDI &gt; 5 . The serious consequence high prevalence OSA clearly constitute major public health problem . OSA strongly related obesity , important public health problem right . In series 1000 OSA patient , two third body weight &gt; 30 % recommend . Several study identify body mass index ( BMI ) strong predictor RDI . Data Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study reveal one standard deviation increase BMI associate four-fold increase risk RDI &gt; 5 . Among obese patient seek weight loss treatment , nearly 40 % exhibited evidence SDB , 10 % require treatment OSA . The link obesity SDB support data show weight loss significantly improve SDB obese patient OSA . Perhaps compel data effect weight change SDB , particularly weight gain , come recent study Wisconsin Sleep Cohort examine change weight SDB 4 year community sample 690 . On average , sample experience 3 kg weight gain 1.4/hr increase RDI . Across entire sample , average , 1 % change body weight associate 3 % change RDI . Participants reduce body weight 10 % experience 26 % reduction RDI , increase body weight 10 % experience 32 % increase RDI . A 10 % weight gain associate 6-fold increase risk develop RDI &gt; 15 . These descriptive , longitudinal data suggestive benefit weight loss SDB , several factor limit conclusion effect weight loss obese OSA patient . First , initial mean RDI 4.1 , subject ( n = 46 ) moderate severe OSA ( RDI &gt; 15 ) . Further , small number subject ( n = 61 ) lose &gt; 5 % initial body weight . Finally , similar broad literature effect weight loss , study limit lack no-weight loss control group inability distinguish intentional non-intentional weight loss . Weight loss frequently recommend treatment obese patient OSA , data support recommendation available . The lack randomized trial , study predominantly male sample , absence follow-up evaluation leave physician patient unsure clinical utility weight loss obese OSA patient . This study assess effect weight loss sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) obese , type 2 diabetic OSA ( RDI &gt; 15 ) randomly assign Lifestyle Intervention Group Diabetes Education Support Group condition part large Look AHEAD trial . Our assessment patient baseline , 1 2 year allow u examine relationship weight change SDB time . We also examine role neck abdominal fat distribution mediate effect weight loss SDB . Finally , assess impact SDB mediating change blood pressure associate weight loss . All subject obese type 2 diabetic enrol large Look AHEAD Study . Fifty-eight subject total need . Thirty subject RDI &gt; 15 28 subject RDI 5-14.9 randomize either Lifestyle Intervention Group Diabetes Education Support Group . All participant complete follow assessment : Nocturnal polysomnography ( PSG ) . Overnight , unattended PSGs record participant ' home use Compumedics ' PS2 portable sleep system . Two sleep technician go participant 's home 8:00-9:00 PM night PSG . A series calibration perform signal quality sensor position adjust necessary . Before technician depart , device set activate 60 minute prior subject 's intended bedtime . The subject ask sit quietly read watch television duration time light his/her regular bedtime . The next morning , 2 sleep technician return participant 's home remove electrodes sensor retrieve equipment . Neck circumference . Neck fat distribution estimate measurement neck circumference baseline 1 2 year study 's Research Coordinator Look AHEAD annual clinic visit . All measurement perform twice record near 0.1 cm . Blood pressure . Blood pressure assess baseline year 1 2 participant 's home sleep technician . Measurements take night equipment attach morning equipment detach . Since PSG anchor participant usual sleep wake schedule , obtain morning even blood pressure approximately times day . Blood pressure measure dominant arm 5 minute quiet rest seat position . Two measurement , separate 1 minute , perform average . Sagittal diameter . Sagittal diameter measure Holtain-Kahn Abdominal Caliper baseline 1 2 year Research Coordinator Look AHEAD annual clinic visit . The measurement perform twice record near 0.1 cm . Questionnaires . Daytime sleepiness assess Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) . The ESS self-administered questionnaire measure general level daytime sleepiness . The ESS significantly distinguish patient without OSA ; score 10 consider indicative pathological sleepiness . Furthermore , show decrease OSA patient treat continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . Quality life specific sleep apnea assess Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire ( FOSQ ) . The FOSQ measure assess impact disorder excessive sleepiness functional outcome relevant daily behavior quality life . The FOSQ reliably distinguish apneics control sensitive treatment effect . These measure assess baseline 1 2 year study 's Research Coordinator Look AHEAD clinic visit take approximately 10 minute complete . Upper airway assessment . A brief ( &lt; 10 minute ) standardize clinical assessment upper airway craniofacial feature distinguishes apneics non-apneics perform baseline year 1 2 Research Coordinator . Sleep log . Participants give sleep log keep 7 day prior in-home sleep study . Each morning wake even go bed answer question concern quality sleep daytime activity . The procedure treatment propose study pose know risk subject ' physical psychological well-being . The requirement impose upon participant ancillary study pose additional risk already present large Look AHEAD trial . There invasive measure associate study . The benefit subject study research protocol , society large , far surpass risk . Our study provide valuable sleep assessment population high risk sleep apnea , significant benefit since case SDB United States ( 90 % ) undetected . Furthermore , study offer patient physicians valuable information necessary making subsequent decision regard clinical management SDB . The requirement impose upon participant ancillary study pose additional risk already present large Look AHEAD trial . Although weight loss frequently recommend treatment obese patient OSA , one randomize control trial include weight loss group . Therefore , finding study provide important information society large determine effectiveness weight loss treatment OSA , serious health problem .</detailed_description>
