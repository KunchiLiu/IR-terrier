	<brief_summary>The University Washington receive funding conduct proof-of-concept trial assess impact suppression genital herpes HIV infectiousness . This study ( Partners Prevention Study ) enroll HIV discordant heterosexual couple HIV-infected partner co-infected herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV-2 ) test efficacy twice daily ( bid ) acyclovir ( 400 mg ) give HIV-infected partner prevent transmission his/her HIV negative partner ( ) . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial provide evidence efficacy HSV-2 suppression daily acyclovir HIV transmission among HIV-discordant couple among HIV-positive partner also HSV-2 seropositive CD4 &gt; 250 . The researcher hypothesis , decrease frequency amount genital HIV shedding , standard dos daily acyclovir 400 mg bid reduce rate HIV transmission 50 % HIV-discordant couple among HIV-infected partner HSV-2 positive . Under study protocol version 4.1.1 , 3000 HIV-discordant heterosexual couple HIV-positive partner HSV-2 positive CD4 count &gt; 250 recruit ; participant follow 2 year . A 4 % per year HIV incidence placebo arm assume . The first study site begin enrol participant 17 November 2005 . As September 2006 , 14 site Eastern Southern Africa participate recruit 2300 HIV-discordant couple enrol date .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 ( HSV-2 ) Suppression Prevent HIV Transmission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Herpes simplex virus type-2 ( HSV-2 ) primary cause genital ulcer one prevalent sexually transmit disease worldwide . Consistently , 30 study find HSV-2 infection risk factor HIV acquisition overall relative risk 2.1 study demonstrate HSV-2 precede HIV infection . A recent study HIV-discordant couple Rakai , Uganda , show level HIV viral load HIV-positive partner , HSV-2 infection susceptible partner increase per-contact risk acquisition HIV five-fold , GUD HIV-source partner increase per-contact risk HIV transmission five-fold . As strong epidemiological data , intervention trial require define clinical public health significance finding . This trial directly answer extent HSV-2 infection increase infectiousness HIV/HSV-2 co-infected person relative reduction HIV transmission among HSV-2 seropositive person treat daily suppressive antiviral therapy . Acyclovir acceptable safety profile widespread STD treatment inexpensive , well-tolerated , episodic long-term suppressive therapy associate increase acyclovir resistance . Given high HSV-2 seroprevalence HIV-infected person ( 70-80 % ) high HIV incidence population high prevalence HSV-2 infection worldwide , approach could great public health importance provide safe , acceptable , cost-effective method reduce HIV transmission among HIV-infected person also HSV-2 seropositive . Sites enrol couple study include : Johannesburg ( 2 site ) Cape Town , South Africa ; Gaborone , Botswana ; Kitwe/Ndola Lusaka , Zambia ; Nairobi , Kisumu , Eldoret Thika , Kenya ; Moshi , Tanzania ; Kampala , Uganda ; Kigali , Rwanda .</detailed_description>
