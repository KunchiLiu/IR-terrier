	<brief_title>Continuous Temozolomide Patients With Advanced Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because repeat dose temozolomide correlate improve response , may due progressive depletion enzyme AT , hope daily oral schedule active schedule agent . In phase I study dose 85 mg/m2/day continuously well-tolerated . We plan begin dose 75 mg/m2/day 6 week 8 week cycle escalate 85 100 mg/m2/day patient grade 3/4 toxicity . The purpose study determine whether treatment temozolomide effect survival patient advance breast cancer soft tissue sarcoma . To assess response rate , time progression , survival patient advance breast cancer soft tissue sarcoma treat temozolomide .</detailed_description>
