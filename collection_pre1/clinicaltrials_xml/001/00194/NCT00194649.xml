	<brief_summary>The purpose research study help development safe , effective reversible male contraception . We examine impact drug Miglustat sperm production normal men . We want see Miglustat inhibit sperm production men act reversible male contraceptive , study mouse administer Miglustat show reversible inhibition sperm production . We believe Miglustat may potential safe , reversible male contraceptive .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glycosphingolipid Inhibition Spermatogenesis Man : A Pilot Study ( MIG 2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glycosphingolipids ( GSL ) main constituent sperm cell membrane mammal . Male mice deficient enzyme involve GSL synthesis severely impaired fertility knockout mouse infertile . Recently , demonstrate administration mouse inhibitor ceramide-specific glycosyltransferase , first step biosynthetic pathway GSL formation , result reversible infertility without discernable adverse side effect . This inhibitor Miglustat , alkylated imino sugar . The impact Miglustat therapy human spermatogenesis unknown . If effect sperm morphology motility similar observe mouse , Miglustat GSL inhibitor might potential utility non-hormonal male contraceptive .</detailed_description>
