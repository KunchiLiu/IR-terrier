	<brief_title>Strength Training Intervention Breast Cancer Survivors Effects Lymphedema Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study recruit 288 healthy breast cancer survivor ( 1-15 year post diagnosis , currently free cancer ) , two stratum : 144 BrCa survivor stable lymphedema ( defined section D.2 . ) , 144 without lymphedema . The woman lymphedema 1-15 year post diagnosis . The woman without lymphedema 1-5 year post diagnosis . The difference timing due timing onset lymphedema . Because 90 % lymphedema case likely occur 5 year post treatment , would great value evaluate safety strength train woman without lymphedema time frame lymphedema likely develop . Randomization balance time since diagnosis factor . Participants randomly assign within lymphedema stratum , exercise intervention group control group . Participants recruit group ( total 8 wave ) randomize either strength-training group control group . All outcome measurement occur baseline 12 month later ; additionally , participant undergo arm volumetry circumference measure , subset arm function test ( range motion , pain , grip strength ) every 3 month . Protection safety participant All participant give access train lymphedema specialist throughout study participation , pay study , evaluation treatment lymphedema . Participants without lymphedema participate educational session lead Dr. Schmitz co-developed Ms. Benson Ms. Oatman ensure participant enter study clear understanding lymphedema . Each participant lymphedema undergo clinical evaluation review lymphedema related measure assess current management strategy part baseline 12-month measurement visit . The protocol standardize content evaluation session develop first twelve month study . Participants lymphedema , wear compression garment , receive two free garment part participate study . Arm volume , circumference , extra-cellular water arm subset arm function test ( range motion , pain , grip strength ) monitor quarterly participant monthly treatment group participant . All participant encourage request frequent arm volumetry and/or circumference and/or extra-cellular water arm measure believe concern change symptom . Any participant , regardless group assignment , experience onset flare-up lymphedema see trained lymphedema specialist evaluation treatment , pay study . Clinical experience Ms. Oatman Ms. Benson suggest 10 % participant lymphedema experience flare-up 12 month participation . For purpose study , flare-up define 5 % increase inter-limb discrepancy volume circumference point great visible difference.as persistent pain/achiness/fullness ( trunk and/or arm ) , persistent puffiness ( visible ) , change color resolve within three day rest , require 5 day combine decongestive therapy resolve . Further , purpose study , onset lymphedema define follow : among woman diagnose lymphedema prior study entry , &gt; 10 % inter-limb discrepancy volume circumference point great visible difference OR swell obscuration anatomic architecture close inspection OR pit edema . 2 cm 200 ml great difference arm treat breast cancer compare unaffected arm woman diagnose lymphedema prior study entry . By action careful train fitness trainer , monitor participant carefully regard onset worsen lymphedema symptom . The intervention group receive social , behavioral support research staff contact time encourage increase activity level include two weekly strength-training session 12 month . For first three month , exercise session supervise conduct small group 4 , teach specific protocol . Thereafter , participant continue exercise protocol group choose . Treatment group participant hold accountable completing workout exercise logs reminder call research staff . Participants treatment group undergo assessment arm volume circumference , well subset arm function test ( range motion , pain , grip strength ) monthly . The control group undergo outcome measure baseline 12 month , measure 3 6 month . The outcome measure include assessment arm circumference , extra-cellular water arm , volumetry , well subset arm function test ( range motion , pain , grip strength ) , ask neither make purposeful change diet begin strength train final measure complete 12 month later . After completion final measure , control group participant option participate intervention offer treatment group participant , include 1-year membership YMCA , Sisters Shape gym , Pottruck Health Fitness Center .</detailed_description>

No one lymphedema relate infection require antibiotic within past 3 month . Participation Activities Daily Living ( ADLs ) without lymphedema exacerbation past 3 month . For ALL participant ( without lymphedema ) No medical condition medication would prohibit participation exercise program would negatively impact ability test primary aim Not morbidly obese ( body mass index &gt; 50 kg/m2 ) No plan additional ( e.g . reconstructive ) surgery study period No bilateral breast cancer ( prohibits ability assess primary outcome interest ) No strength train upper body resistive exercise within past year Not plan move away area next year Not pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study Among woman give birth : least 6 month post pregnancy least 3 month post lactation</criteria>
