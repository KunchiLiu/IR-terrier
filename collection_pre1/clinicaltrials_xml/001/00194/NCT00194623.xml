	<brief_summary>Chronic pelvic pain syndrome ( CPPS ) think affect approximately 8 % men age 18 old . Patients condition experience pain perineum , genitalia , rectum . As well , associate voiding , sexual , ejaculatory dysfunction . The impact patient well-being thought equivalent patient congestive heart failure . The etiology condition unknown , thus make treatment difficult . Researchers pursue infectious cause disease ; however , study fail substantiate theory . Despite , main treatment offer patient long-term antibiotic therapy . Results treatment modality unsatisfactory . Other group postulate symptom CPPS may secondary neuromuscular factor . Some study demonstrate increase pelvic muscular tone . Maneuvers prostate massage levator massage show benefit relieve symptom . Treatment alpha-blocker relax prostate smooth muscle bring improvement portion patient . Use generalize muscle relaxant produce mediocre result . However , many neuromuscular treatment generalize target perineal musculature directly . It theorize spasm perineal muscle trigger unknown noxious stimulus ( e.g . infection ) cause pain symptom CPPS . At center , perform pilot study use botulinum toxin A . Four patient treat Botox '' . 100 U inject three location midline bulbocavernosus muscle . The bulbocavernosus muscle easily accessible share innervation pelvic musculature . Patient 's response medication measure NIH Prostatitis pain scale well University Washington prostatitis pain scale . All patient report resolution symptom . Remission last duration 10-12 week . No patient report adverse event . HYPOTHESIS Botulinum toxin A effective treatment chronic pelvic pain syndrome men .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Visit 1 Patient review sign study consent form . Subject ask complete questionnaire . Then , patient ask give semen sample . Visit 2 ( 1 week Visit I ) Prior visit , patient randomize either active medication placebo . First , patient undergo physical exam include genital rectal exam . Then , patient bring room place lithotomy position . The perineum prepped iodine solution . EMG electrodes ground place perineum . Three landmark ( 1. middle bulbospongiosus muscle ; 2. perineal body ; 3. area equidistant 1 2 ) mark use skin marker . The EMG needle place landmark patient ask squeeze perineal muscle . Once proper location , 1.3 cc medication ( active drug placebo ) distribute landmark . The remain 2.6 cc inject 2 painful pelvic muscle site determine physical exam . The area gently massage . 1 .
