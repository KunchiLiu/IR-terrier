	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give combination chemotherapy filgrastim together surgery work treat patient human epidermal growth receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive breast cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Colony-stimulating factor , filgrastim , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood may help immune system recover side effect chemotherapy . Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , filgrastim together follow paclitaxel surgery may effective treatment breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Filgrastim Before Surgery Treating Patients With HER2-Positive Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pathologic response rate patient operable breast cancer treat two part , neoadjuvant regimen consist weekly doxorubicin ( doxorubicin hydrochloride ) daily oral cyclophosphamide give G-CSF ( filgrastim ) support 12 week follow weekly paclitaxel 12 week . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical response rate patient surgically resectable breast cancer treat weekly doxorubicin daily oral cyclophosphamide give G-CSF support 12 week . II . To assess clinical response rate patient surgically resectable breast cancer treat weekly paclitaxel 12 week . III . To assess relapse rate , overall disease-free survival patient operable breast cancer treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy consist weekly doxorubicin daily oral cyclophosphamide give G-CSF support 12 week follow weekly paclitaxel 12 week adjuvant chemotherapy Xeloda ( capecitabine ) , Methotrexate Navelbine ( vinorelbine tartrate ) ( XMN ) . IV . To assess toxicity associate regimen . V. To assess whether phenotype breast cancer change treatment . VI . To assess whether phenotypic change breast tumor predict outcome . OUTLINE : PART I : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) day 1 week , cyclophosphamide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) , filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) QD day 2-7 week . Treatment continue 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART II : Patients* receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 week . Treatment continue 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo definitive surgical resection partial mastectomy ( lumpectomy ) mastectomy completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy . PART III : Patients** unable achieve complete pathologic response ( pCR ) disease down-staged = &lt; 1 cm positive node follow surgery receive capecitabine PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 , methotrexate IV day 1 , 8 15 , vinorelbine tartrate IV 6-10 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients HER2/neu-positive disease also receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute weekly every 3 week 1 year begin Part II . NOTE : **Patients hormone receptor-positive disease also receive tamoxifen PO QD 5 year ( premenopausal ) OR letozole PO QD tamoxifen PO QD 5 year ( postmenopausal ) begin Part III . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
