	<brief_summary>The two drug use treat metastatic breast cancer study may perform good use together use separately . The use another drug prevent common side effect two-drug combination permit delivery agent closer `` full '' dose either use alone . We hypothesize two-drug combination use G-CSF support effective less toxic standard regimens treatment metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preclinical data suggest may synergy vinorelbine paclitaxel two drug use combination effect two together may better either alone . Clinical data suggest use concurrent G-CSF paclitaxel vinorelbine permit delivery agent approximately 70 % `` full '' dose either , use alone without G-CSF support , myelosuppression usual dose-limiting toxicity unusual unexpected complication . Encouragingly , 8/20 ( 40 % ) patient objective response , three complete remission ( 15 % ) program third-line therapy . Therefore , propose combine docetaxel 70 % `` full '' dose vinorelbine 27.5 mg/m2 , `` phase II '' dose define previous trial . Docetaxel give day 1 follow vinorelbine day 8 15 , G-CSF administer day except docetaxel administration . The cycle repeat every three week .</detailed_description>
