	<brief_title>Aortic Regurgitation After Surgical Repair Outlet-Type Ventricular Septal Defect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Progression aortic regurgitation ( AR ) repair outlet ( juxta-arterial , muscular outlet perimembranous outlet ) ventricular septal defect ( VSD ) remain unclear . From 1987 2002 , 411 patient complete follow-up repair outlet VSD constitute study population . Study end point aortic valve replacement mortality . Aortic valve replacement perform seventeen patient ( 4.1 % ) , logistic regression show severity preoperative AR age VSD repair predictor . After exclude eleven patient endocarditis analysis , 377 patient none mild AR ( Group I ) 23 moderate severe AR ( Group II ) preoperatively . Total follow-up 2,230 person-years . After VSD repair , 5- 10-year freedom aortic valve replacement Group I 100 % , Group II 50.2 % . In Group II , ten patient receive aortic valve replacement 8 underwent valvuloplasty VSD repair . One patient need valve replacement four year later . Age VSD repair predictor aortic valve replacement . In Group I , AR progress four patient ( 1.2 % , two juxta-arterial two perimembranous outlet ) 3.5 7.9 year later associate aortic valvar subvalvar anomaly . The event-free curve three outlet type VSD show difference . Although AR progress rarely ( probably muscular outlet type ) repair outlet type VSD none mild preoperative AR , presence aortic valvar subvalvar anomaly , early surgical repair VSD still warrant .</detailed_description>
