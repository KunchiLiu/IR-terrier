	<brief_title>Mechanisms Neuropathic Pain : Investigation Contact Heat Evoked Potential</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only study focus clinical disease like neuropathic pain neurogenic pain . Little known difference normal pathogenic pain processing . It opportunity apply EEG , ERPs clinical field . In many clinical condition , brain lesion provide chance study possible roles one neural structure pain integration processing . In addition application EEG/ERPs clinical condition may help understand mechanism genesis pain pathogenic condition , diagnosis pathogenic pain , therapeutic aspect abnormal pain sens . One limit study human pain inappropriate stimulation method . Evoked potential contact heat previously difficult elicit due slow temperature rise time associate thermal stimulators . However recently , CHEPS ( Contact Heat-Evoked Potential Stimulator ) develop , use newly develop heat-foil technology create rapid heat rate ( 70Â°C/sec ) . The baseline peak temperature rise time precisely control . It provide non-invasive technique investigation human pain activation relate thermal nociceptive pathway involve pain processing . Unlike heat stimulation deliver laser , CHEPS deliver noxious thermal stimulus repeatedly large area skin evoke pain response A-Delta C fiber . In addition rate stimulation rapid lead effect temporal summation . When use EEG record system , patient 's response pain perception evoke potential ( EPs ) record , provide objective information integrity nociceptive afferent peripheral nerve system , spinal cord , well brain response different structure . The CHEPS provide investigator practical convenient tool clinical application study pain . The investigator use CHEPS stimulation study heat evoke potential analyze difference normal subject patient peripheral nerve disease . These might help clarify mechanism neuropathic pain .</detailed_description>
