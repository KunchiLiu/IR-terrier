	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Primary screening sigmoidoscopy would miss substantial proportion advance proximal neoplasia ( APN ) , screen universal colonoscopy costly . The aim study ass efficacy mixed strategy use sigmoidoscopy young patient colonoscopy old patient . MATERIALS METHODS : We analyze establish database contain consecutive average-risk adult age 50 old underwent screen colonoscopy part health check-up . We assess efficacy mixed screen strategy use colonoscopy person age certain cut-off age sigmoidoscopy person age age . Those underwent sigmoidoscopy initially would refer subsequent colonoscopy distal sentinel lesion detect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening CRC Using Mixed Strategy Sigmoidoscopy Colonoscopy Average-Risk Population According Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because prevalence proximal colon cancer APN high old patients15 , great proportion advance colonic neoplasia cancer would miss colonoscopy perform old patient . So develop mixed strategy offer sigmoidoscopy young patient reserve colonoscopy old patient , might able detect APN few colonoscopic procedure . We aim determine optimal cut-off age choose appropriate distal sentinel lesion subsequent colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
