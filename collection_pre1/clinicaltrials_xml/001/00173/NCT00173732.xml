	<detailed_description>Preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) couple risk conception serious genetic disorder firmly establish valid reproductive option couple consider follow appropriate genetic counseling . The procedure entail balance risk establish successful pregnancy minimize risk misdiagnosis . PGD single gene disorder rely PCR-based test perform single cell ( polar body blastomere ) . Despite use increasingly robust protocol , allele drop-out ( ADO ; failure amplify one two allele heterozygous cell ) remain significant problem diagnosis use single cell PCR . In extreme case ADO affect &gt; 40 % amplification already cause several PGD misdiagnoses . Fundamental genetic analysis availability genomic DNA adequate quality quantity . Because DNA yield human sample frequently limit , much effort invest develop method whole genome amplification ( WGA ) random degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR . However , exist WGA method like degenerate oligonucleotideprimed PCR suffer incomplete coverage inadequate average DNA size . Multiple displacement amplification ( MDA ) provide highly uniform representation across genome . Amplification bias among eight chromosomal loci less 3-fold contrast 4–6 order magnitude PCR-based WGA method . Average product length &gt; 10 kb . MDA isothermal , strand-displacing amplification yield 20–30 μg product 1–10 copy human genomic DNA . Amplification carry directly biological sample include crude whole blood tissue culture cell . MDA-amplified human DNA useful several common method genetic analysis , include genotyping single nucleotide polymorphism , chromosome painting , Southern blot restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis , subcloning , DNA sequence . MDA-based WGA simple reliable method could significant implication genetic study , forensics , diagnostics , long-term sample storage . In study carefully vary reaction condition single cell amplification isolate peripheral lymphocyte minimize rate ADO . Consideration causal factor identify study permit design PGD protocols experience little ADO , thus improve accuracy PGD single gene disorder .</detailed_description>
