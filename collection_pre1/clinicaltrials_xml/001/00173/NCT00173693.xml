	<brief_summary>This study aim conduct cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) among program prevent osteoporotic fracture . The main comparison make among effect three program prevent osteoporotic fracture : 1. health education ; 2. exercise intervention enhance bone mineral density ( BMD ) ; 3. exercise intervention prevent fall . The `` cost '' measure base monetary cost implementation program . The `` effectiveness '' measure include number prevent osteoporotic fracture program , related outcome follow : 1. medical cost osteoporotic fracture ; 2. change BMD consecutive year ; 3. quality life ( QOL ) patient osteoporotic fracture compare reference population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim conduct cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) among program prevent osteoporotic fracture . The main comparison make among effect three program prevent osteoporotic fracture : 1. health education ; 2. exercise intervention enhance bone mineral density ( BMD ) ; 3. exercise intervention prevent fall . The `` cost '' measure base monetary cost implementation program . The `` effectiveness '' measure include number prevent osteoporotic fracture program , related outcome follow : 1. medical cost osteoporotic fracture ; 2. change BMD consecutive year ; 3. quality life ( QOL ) patient osteoporotic fracture compare reference population . First year ( 2006 ) : mainly preparation stage 1 . To conduct meta-analysis effect various intervention prevention osteoporotic fracture , especially exercise model . 2 . To establish exercise program intervention 2nd year , include booklet poster . 3 . To review alternative prevention osteoporotic fracture . 4 . To establish social network need follow research . Second year ( 2007 ) : start community-based field study Neihu District , Taipei . All 37 `` Lis '' Neihu invite join study , Lis willingness participation unit cluster sampling , randomize three program ( Li unit ) . People live sample Lis meet inclusion criterion ( postmenopausal ( minimum 1year ) woman men 65 year old ) recruit randomized intervention group reference group within program . 1.To collect baseline data . Baseline data include : BMD , physical activity , nutrition diary , muscle strength , balance , risk factor osteoporosis , history fracture fall 2.To execute intervention . Three program execute sampled Lis . They design randomize control trial . 1 . Health education ( HE trial ) : lecture knowledge osteoporosis , osteoporotic fracture , risk factor , nutritional demand , exercise principle enhance BMD prevent fall . 2 . Intervention enhance BMD ( BMD trial ) : intervention emphasize weight-bearing exercise trunk stabilization exercise . The exercise program supervise professional physical therapist 3 time per week 3 month . 3 . Intervention prevent fall ( fall prevention trial ) : intervention emphasize balance strength training exercise . The exercise program also supervise professional physical therapist 3 time per week 3 month . 3.To apply NHRI release health insurance data ( 2002-2006 ) next year study Third year ( 2008 ) : follow-up , cost calculation study medical cost 1 . To calculate cost three intervention program ( view provider ) . 2 . Telephone follow-up ( FU ) record incidence fall &amp; fracture every 3 month . 3 . The first FU ( 1st FU ) item collect baseline . 4 . To study medical cost osteoporotic fracture NHRI data . Fourth year ( 2009 ) : continue follow-up study QOL 1 . Continuing telephone FU record incidence fall &amp; fracture every 3 month 2 . The second FU ( 2nd FU ) item collect baseline 3 . To conduct survey health-related QOL people osteoporotic fracture outpatient clinic hospital newly fracture subject community . Fifth year ( 2010 ) : continue follow-up CEA 1 . Continuing telephone FU record incidence fall &amp; fracture every 3 month . 2 . The third FU ( 3rd F/U ) item collect baseline . 3 . To investigate effect intervention program</detailed_description>
