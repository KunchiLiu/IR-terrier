	<brief_title>The Role SDF-1/CXCR4 Metastasis Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral cancer common head neck malignancy , constitute near 9 % cancer ( 1 ) . Squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) common histopathologic type oral malignancy , account 90 % cancer occur region ( 2 ) . The presence absence regional lymph node metastases single important factor affect prognosis patient oral cancer . Cure rate oral cancer decrease approximately 50 percent patient cervical lymph node metastasis ( 3 ) . Tumor metastasis hallmark malignancy , probably result interaction tumor cell supportive microenvironment . Malignant cell capability metastasize particular organ may various property support tissue invasion growth enhance adherence microvascular cell organ , high responsiveness chemotactic signal release target organ increase response local soluble tissue associate growth signal target organ ( 4,5 ) . Though several molecule express produced cancer cell consider metastatic factor , remain unknown factor produce lymph node tissue affect metastasis cancer cell . Chemokines large family pro-inflammatory polypeptide cytokine , consist small ( 7–15 kDa ) , structurally relate heparin-binding protein . They group CXC chemokines CC chemokines , basis characteristic presence four conserve cysteine residue ( 6-8 ) . Chemokines produce locally tissue act target cell G-protein-coupled receptor , characterize structurally seven transmembrane span domain . Chemokines involve attraction activation mononuclear polymorphonuclear leukocyte sit inflammatory response , bacterial viral infection , allergy , cardiovascular disease wound healing ( 4 , 8-13 ) . Chemokines know also function regulatory molecule leukocyte maturation , trafficking , home T B lymphocytes , development lymphoid tissue , dendritic cell maturation ( 14,15 ) . Other function chemokines describe recently , particularly CXC chemokines . The role chemokines malignant tumor clear yet . Some chemokines may enhance innate specific host immunity tumor dissemination . On hand , may advocate tumor growth metastasis promote tumor cell proliferation , migration angiogenesis tumor tissue ( 4 ) . Reports suggest several type cancer , breast ( 16 ) , ovary ( 17 ) , prostate ( 18 ) , kidney ( 19 ) , brain ( 20 ) , lung ( 21 ) , thyroid ( 22 ) , express chemokine receptor use chemokines metastasize target organ home hematopoietic cell . SDF-1 belongs CXC chemokine family ligand CXCR4 ( 23 , 24 ) . SDF-1 initially clone Tashiro et al . ( 25 ) later identify growth factor B cell progenitor , chemotactic factor T cell monocytes , B-cell lymphopoiesis bone marrow myelopoiesis ( 23 , 26–27 ) . Most chemokine receptor interact pleural ligand , vice versa , SDF-1/CXCR4 receptor ligand system show involve one-on-one interaction ( 28 , 29 ) . Recently , several study conduct detect mRNA expression CXCR4 SDF-1 solid tumor . The result uniform , relevance cancer progression determine ( 30 , 31 ) . Sehgal et al . ( 30 , 32 ) conclude CXCR4 play important role proliferation tumorigenic property human glioblastoma tumor . Muller et al . ( 33 ) report SDF-1 signaling CXCR4 interaction appear determine directional migration breast cancer cell basement membrane . Furthermore vivo , interaction SDF-1 CXCR4 significantly repress metastatic potential breast cancer cell lymph node lung . Barnard colleague ( 34 , 35 ) show contrary result CXCR4 mRNA expression reduce hepatocellular carcinoma tissue compare noncancerous tissue , change colon , esophageal , gastric cancer . They also find reduce mRNA expression SDF-1 malignant tissue ( 31 ) . Thus , diversity view role SDF-1/CXCR4 receptor ligand system malignant tissue . And study limit oral cancer . Since metastasis oral cancer occur frequently lymphatic system , metastasis key prognostic factor disease . Evaluation relationship SDF-1/CXCR4 system metastasis oral cancer could help u understand whether system important metastasis disease . We hypothesize SDF-1/CXCR4 ( ligand/receptor ) system play important role oral cancer metastasis . To test hypothesis , investigate ( 1 ) distribution CXCR4 protein expression cancer lymph node tissue mean immunohistochemical analysis tissue sample obtain surgical operation , ( 2 ) relationship CXCR4 expression clinicopathological finding special reference cancer metastasis , ( 3 ) expression SDF-1 CXCR4 cancer cell line cell tissue , ( 4 ) chemotactic activity growth-promoting effect SDF-1 cancer cell line cell , ( 5 ) role Src , MAPK , Akt signal transduction pathway response , ( 6 ) effect block agent response . Undoubtedly , finding study help u understand whether SDF-1/CXCR4 system could focal point anti-cancer research . If oral SCC express high level CXCR4 show consistently high incidence lymphatic distant metastasis , block SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling may novel approach inhibit metastasis patient . The development SDF-1/CXCR4 system antagonist provide opportunity improve survival rate .</detailed_description>
