	<brief_summary>Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) new emerge infectious disease . Its pathogen newly discover coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) . The clinical course classify 3 stage : viral replication phase , hyperimmune reactive phase , pulmonary destruction phase . Human monocyte play critical role initiation immune response defend intracellular pathogen ( eg virus ) . Monocytes engulf virus present viral antigen major histocompatibility ( MHC ) molecule cell surface initiate T lymphocyte response . Monocytes also secrete various cytokine modulate immune response . SARS-CoV mutant animal virus cause human disease able cause unusual severe respiratory illness . It suggest unusual severe disease due intense immune reaction . The investigator harvest human monocyte healthy adult child blood donor . Monocytes would culture infected SARS-CoV . The change viral load monitor infection . Cytokines secrete monocyte infection also measure . The difference monocyte cytokine secretion compare adult child . The study verify SARS-CoV infectivity human monocytes prove unusual severity cause SARS-CoV related viral-induced dysregulation cytokine response . The result may also clarify adult tend severe illness compare child .</brief_summary>
