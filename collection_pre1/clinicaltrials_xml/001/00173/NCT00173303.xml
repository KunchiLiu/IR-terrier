	<brief_title>The Diagnostic Efficacy Computer-Aided Detection ( CAD ) Full-Field Digital Mammography ( FFDM ) - A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mammography currently document effective imaging tool breast cancer screening . However , sensitivity mammography may reduce dense breast , sometimes difficult even perceive subtle cancer present small stellate lesion , faint microcalcifications , miss diagnose thus occurs . Herein , researcher Western country develop computer-aided detection ( CAD ) system help radiologist detect subtle , easily overlook finding facilitate early breast cancer detection , research regard CAD use screen-film mammography ( SFM ) system . Ikeda , et al , work retrospective CAD usage negative mammogram later develop breast cancer . CAD could correctly mark 40 % area mammograms report negative previously later develop evident cancer . However , 80 % nonspecific finding , warrant recall additional workup even retrospective unblinded review well-trained mammographers . The research conclude CAD could improve early cancer detection rate mammography , sensitivity 92 % detection breast cancer size small 5mm , 94 % cancer size 11-15mm . CAD detect microcalcifications mass ( sensitivity microcalcifications 98 % , mass 84 % , mass microcalcifications 92 % ) . CAD could mark average 1.3 false positive mark per mammographic exam . Full-field digital mammography ( FFDM ) new approve technology breast cancer detection SFM era since 2000 . The diagnostic accuracy FFDM versus SFM still clinical trial , believe sensitivity accuracy FFDM screen population relatively equivalent SFM . However , report regard CAD application FFDM , since FFDM offer post-acquisition processing high-resolution review workstation interpretation . Nevertheless , spatial resolution soft-copy reading monitor FFDM slightly inferior contrast resolution slightly superior conventional SFM . Herein , diagnostic efficacy role CAD FFDM still unclear . Therefore , goal study explore sensitivity , false-negative ( FN ) false-positive ( FP ) rate combination usage CAD FFDM system , comparison sensitivity , FN FP rate interpretation base FFDM without CAD combination . We also evaluate efficacy , additional time spend adjunct application CAD FFDM interpretation , order ass feasibility CAD FFDM .</detailed_description>
