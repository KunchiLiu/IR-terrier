	<brief_title>The Assessment Mesothelin Antigen Specific Immunologic Assays Ovarian Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Incidence Ovarian Cancer : Ovarian cancer first mortality rate gynecologic malignancy overall 5-year survival rate 20–30 % . It become important disease recent year incidence ovarian cancer also increase recent year Taiwan . The lack symptom , difficulty early diagnosis , insufficient accurate tumor marker , lack information ovarian tumor biology contribute poor prognosis ovarian cancer patient . The prognostic parameter ovarian carcinomas tumor stage , histologic subtype , degree malignancy , residual tumor surgical treatment . However , factor present incomplete picture tumor biology ovarian cancer frequently interrelate . Thus , identification new biologic factor predictive individual disease course prognosis would extremely useful . From above-mentioned data , ovarian cancer indeed disease respect , however , little research do focus Taiwan . Treatment Ovarian Cancer : Epithelial Ovarian Cancer ( EOC ) extraovarian Müllerian carcinoma similar pathologic entity share preference peritoneal cavity involvement . The spread pattern tumor present challenge unique opportunity immunotherapy . Patients EOC stage I disease ( localized ovary ) optimal surgical staging , 5-year survival rate 90 % , significant change 10 year . In contrast , patient spread beyond ovary median survival rate decrease &lt; 10 % patient bulky residual disease surgery treatment platinum-based combination chemotherapy . A randomized trial first-line chemotherapy patient EOC residual mass large 1 cm initial surgery , show median survival period 38 month cisplatin/paclitaxel , significantly great 24 month cisplatin/cytoxan treatment arm . In interim analysis equivalency trial , survival carboplatin/paclitaxel bad cisplatin/paclitaxel . Even though early diagnosis important goal ongoing clinical research effort , unclear whether advanced EOC start multicentric process involve ovary peritoneal surface . It establish hereditary factor contribute development EOC . Germline BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation account approximately 10 % EOC . In woman BRCA 1 2 mutation , lifetime risk ovarian cancer range 16 % –44 % . With commercial availability genetic test BRCA1 BRCA2 , woman identify high risk ovarian cancer . There clear guideline cancer prevention individual . Although prophylactic oophorectomy reasonable option woman complete childbearing , woman still risk develop peritoneal cancer . Clearly , option prevention need . Immunotherapy Ovarian Cancer : In develop effective immune-based strategy EOC , distinction preventative therapeutic approach . It anticipated immunoprevention ( immunoprophylaxis ) develop woman increase risk development EOC . In contrast , immunotherapy would use adjuvant surgery combination chemotherapy biologics chemoimmunotherapy biochemoimmunotherapy . Patients undetectable disease restaged chemotherapy could consider immunotherapy presumption majority fact micrometastases . Development effective immune-based concept prevention treatment EOC require understand tumor-immunology principle , mechanisms action expand array immune modulating molecule , identification characterization tumor antigen , determination microenvironment factor could impact different immune-effector mechanism . The clinical researcher provide many immune direct agent , progress integration standard therapy somewhat slow . Mesothelin : Mesothelin 40-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein . It synthesize precursor molecular mass 69 kDa , proteolytically process N terminal secrete form molecular mass 30 kDa membrane-bound form 40 kDa . In normal tissue , expression mesothelin subsequently show largely restrict mesothelial cell , although immunoreactivity also report epithelial cell trachea , tonsil , fallopian tube , kidney . Hough et al . observed mesothelin over-expressed ovarian carcinoma . It seem mesothelin may utilize tumor marker target antigen ovarian carcinoma . Epitopes Mesothelin Human Haplotype : The incidence HLA-A2 haplotype 50 % Western country . The incidence HLA-A2 A24 haplotype around 30 % 15 % Taiwan , respectively . The specific epitope mesothelin HLA-A2 A24 haplotype identify . There Mesothelin aa20-28 ( peptide SLLFLLFSL ) aa530-538 ( peptide VLPLTVAEV ) HLA-A2 haplotype . And Mesothelin aa435-443 ( peptide FYPGYLCSL ) aa475-483 ( peptide LYPKARLAF ) epitopes HLA-A24 haplotype . Our research team focus development cancer vaccine immunotherapy several year . Our laboratory facility also set evaluate human immunologic assay human papilloma virus type 16 E7 antigen grant support National Taiwan University Hospital . It important set various mesothelin-specific immunologic assay human being evaluate effect cancer vaccine immunotherapy ovarian cancer future clinical trial . So would like provide proposal address development mesothelin-specific immunologic assay human being . There several aim project : 1. develop utilize assay measure CTLs mesothelin , 2. evaluate mesothelin-specific immunologic response normal control ovarian cancer patient .</detailed_description>
