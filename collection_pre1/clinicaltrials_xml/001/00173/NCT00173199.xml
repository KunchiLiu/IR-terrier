	<brief_title>The Changes Cytokines Guillain Barré Syndrome : Correlation With Clinical Manifestations Skin Innervation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past nerve system long regard privileged site immune system due ( 1 ) absence lymphatic drainage , limit immunological circulation ; ( 2 ) blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) blood-nerve barrier ( BNB ) , limit passage immune cell factor ; ( 3 ) low level expression MHC factor , particularly MHC II , resident cell nerve system lack potent antigen present cell , dendritic Langerhans ' cell , lead reduce recognition neuron nerve immune system ; ( 4 ) presence immunosuppressive factor TGF-b . suppress immune response nervous system . However past year , concept privilege revise , difference immunological aspect nervous system organ quantitative absolutely qualitative . Several line evidence indicate BBB BNB complete anatomically functionally activate T cell cross barrier traffic nervous system . The nervous system also contain collection immunologically resident cell , include professional non-professional antigen present cell resident endoneurial perivascular macrophage , glial cell , Schwann cell endoneurial capillary endothelial cell , capable synthesize cytokine initially classify within domain immune system find express range appropriate specific receptor , characteristic mediate immunological process nervous system . The nerve system therefore target immune attack . Many disorder central peripheral nerve system related activation immune system . Immune mechanisms seem important pathogenesis treatment disorder . Cytokines diverse group soluble proteins peptide act humoral regulator modulate activity individual cell tissue either normal pathological condition . Unlike hormone , cytokine usually make one type cell , multiple target cell multiple action , usually function short act radius . Constitutive cytokine production usually low absent production promote certain stimuli transcription translation level . The function cytokine pleitropic redundant . In embryogenesis organ development , act regulator miosis , differentiation , migration , cell growth cell death ; host defense response infection , inflammation , autoimmune , trauma metabolic injury , stimulate immune cell proliferate differentiate also regulate progression termination immunological reaction . Some cytokine make inflammation progress refer pro-inflammatory cytokine . The major pro-inflammatory cytokine responsible early response IL1 , IL6 , TNF-alpha . Other pro-inflammatory mediator include IFN-gamma , TGF-beta , GM-CSF , IL11 , IL12 , IL17 , IL18 , IL8 variety chemokines chemoattract inflammatory cell . When cytokine produce administered human , induce destruction tissue , up-regulation synthesis pro-inflammatory cytokine various immunological cell , induction systemic inflammatory reaction like fever shock . Another immunoregulatory cytokine counteract inflammation production pro-inflammatory cytokine refer anti-inflammatory cytokine . These mediator act mainly inhibit production pro-inflammatory cytokine counteract many biological effect pro-inflammatory mediator thus contribute control inflammatory response . The major anti-inflammatory cytokine IL4 , IL10 , IL13 . Other anti-inflammatory mediator IL16 , IFN-alpha , TGF-beta , G-CSF , well soluble receptor TNF IL6 . It suppose balance pro-inflammatory cytokine anti-inflammatory cytokine determines net effect inflammatory response . In addition , cytokine response regulate special subpopulation CD4 ( + ) T-cells , call helper T cell . They provide help cell immune system mount immune response cause cell activation secretion cytokine . Th1 cell stimulate strong cellular immunity weak transient antibody response . These cell produce number cytokine know asTh1 cytokine include IL2 , IFN-gamma , IL12 TNF-beta . In contrast Th2 cell evoke strong antibody response relatively weak cellular activity . These cell produce cytokine know Th2 cytokine include IL4 , IL5 , IL6 , IL10 , IL13 . Th1 Th2 cell keep check prevent inflammatory reaction response pathogens get control . However , imbalance may also precipitate inappropriate reaction . It think autoimmune disorder allergy may relate overactive Th1 Th2 response . Guillain-Barré syndrome ( GBS ) clinically define acute peripheral neuropathy time period day , , 4 week . GBS may single disease , variety acute neuropathy different clinical electrophysiological manifestation . GBS consider autoimmune disease cause cross reaction infectious agent auto-antigen . The trigger autoimmunity depend increase immunogenicity target cell individual 's capability recognize antoantigens ( HLA gene , T cell repertoire ) . The pathogenesis GBS yet fully understood GBS variable clinical manifestation suppose associate different immune mediate pathogenic mechanism . By study GBS patient clinical manifestation , conventional laboratory study , electrophysiological study skin biopsy evaluate cytokine expression CSF serum different subtypes GBS , want clarify relationship immunological parameter clinical manifestation GBS .</detailed_description>
