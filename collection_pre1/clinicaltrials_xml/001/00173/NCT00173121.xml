	<brief_summary>From last decade , lack powerful quantitative method , real-time qPCR , environmental monitoring data enterovirus transmission . If major transmission route risk factor still clear , hard make prevention control strategy . Today , popular prevention suggestion child keep away crowd public place peak contagious season , enteroviruses easily transmit aerosol distance meter , even separate room ( Chang et al. , 2004 ) . However , adult may easily infect , don』t disease symptom carry virus home . Another recommendation wash hand avoid contact hand anything else mouth nose , contact virus mucosal membrane mouth nasal passage infection occur . However , action great helpful prevent enterovirus infection spread . Understanding disrupt major transmission pas way enterovirus could effective keep personal hygiene . Therefore , applicable environmental monitoring program need understanding transmission route risk factor enterovirus infection . In study , monitor enterovirus hospital , household kindergarten . For environmental monitoring enterovirus , apply traditional plaque assay , real-time quantitative PCR combine questionnaire-based interview understand infectious type concentration enterovirus indoor air , surface water recognize transmission route enterovirus relationship virus concentration symptom case .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Environmental Monitoring Program Enterovirus ( 1 ) Case Collection . The study case include patient suspected enterovirus illness , HFMD herpangina . Institutional review board approval obtain Hospital study inform consent obtain patient parent . ( 2 ) Questionnaire . questionnaire base interview use collect information family member , include demographic data , number bedroom house , amount contact time patient , presence pattern current recent sign symptom . ( 3 ) Patient culture sample . Laboratory evidence enterovirus infection define isolation enterovirus throat , rectal swab sample . ( 4 ) Environmental Sampling . ( ) Air sample . For filter/real-time qPCR assay , air ward filter 37-mm-diameter Nuclepore filter ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) , track-etched polycarbonate filter consist polycarbonate membrane straight-through pore uniform size ( 0.4 μm ) . The filter support cellulose pad load open-face three-piece plastic cassette . The pump filter apparatus place within 1 patient ’ bed adjacent nightstand . ( b ) Surface sample Regarding surface sampling , surface environment equipment sample moisten sterile cotton swab .</detailed_description>
