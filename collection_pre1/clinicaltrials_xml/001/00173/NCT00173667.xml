	<brief_title>A Study Nifecardia SRFC Adalat OROS Treatment Patients With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction : Nifedipine one first calcium-channel blocker widely use treatment hypertension . Because long-term application experience safety profile , traditional nifedipine remodel sustain release formulary Nifecardia SRFC . Nifecardia SRFC new formulary design zero-order kinetic release system maintain constant plasma concentration nifedipine achieve target daily application . Nifecardia SRFC bioequivalence efficacy Adalat OROS also sustain release type calcium-channel blocker . In study , efficacy safety profile Nifecardia SRFC Adalat OROS evaluate randomized head-to-head design treat patient hypertension . 2 . Objective : 1 . To evaluate antihypertensive efficacy two brand nifedipine ( 30mg ) patient hypertension . 2 . To assess safety 8 week therapy two brand nifedipine ( 30mg ) patient hypertension . 3 . To study flow-mediated dilatation oxidative stress nonsmoker essential hypertension without diabetes mellitus dyslipidemia . 3 . Study Design : 1 . Head-to-head , randomized parallel design . 2 . A total 60 patient clinically confirm diagnosis hypertension provide 30 available patient treatment group . Inclusion criterion : - Male non-pregnant female patient age 18-70 year . - Patients hypertension sit systolic blood pressure 140-180 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure 90-110 mmHg . - Patients must give write informed consent participate study . Exclusion criterion : - Women pregnant nursing . - Patients evidence secondary malignant hypertension , history severe heart disease , cerebrovascular accident within one year , myocardial infarction within six month . - Patients receive one anti-hypertensive agent one antihypertensive agent maximal recommend dosage entrance trial . - Patients uncontrolled diabetes mellitus . - Patients know hypersensitivity contraindication nifedipine , calcium channel blocker beta-adrenergic antagonist . - Patients evidence hepatic dysfunction ( AST , ALT &gt; 3 time upper limit normal value ) , renal dysfunction ( serum creatinine concentration &gt; 1.5 mg/dl ) , pulmonary dysfunction , mental disorder concurrent severe disease . - As study flow-mediated dilatation oxidative stress , patient diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , body mass index &gt; 27 , smoker exclude . 3 . The drug dosage follow : Group A : nifedipine 30-60mg daily ( Nifecardia , CCPC ) Group B : nifedipine 30-60 mg daily ( Adalat OROS , Bayer ) 4 . Method : After washout period , eligible patient randomly allocate receive two brand nifedipine 30 mg daily . Each patient receive two time ambulatory blood pressure measurement ( ABPM ) entrance final stage study . The patient also undergo complete clinical evaluation . Therapy dosage start dose nifedipine 30 mg daily . Dosage adjust systolic blood pressure great 140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure great 90 mmHg office measurement 4 week treatment . Nifedipine increase 60 mg daily . The Ambulatory blood pressure measurement set take read 1-hour interval 24 hour assessment . Physical examination include measurement heart rate blood pressure . The value read Visit 1 3-12 hour last dose nifedipine . Routine laboratory test include hematology , blood chemistry urinalysis .

Thiobarbituric acid–reactive substance ( TBARS ) patient plasma measure oxidative stress endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation also evaluate . Possible concomitant medication remain constant throughout study . The physician question patient compliance visit . If compliance dose reach 80 % , subject drop . Withdrawal subject base follow three assessment : ( 1 ) compliant study protocol , ( 2 ) occurrence severe symptom complication , ( 3 ) unacceptable side effect study drug . 5 . Adverse event Safety evaluation : All adverse event record adverse event section case report form ( CRF ) . Serious drug adverse event notify within 24h hospital monitor China Chemistry &amp; Pharmaceuticals Co. Safety evaluation base doctor ’ evaluation result clinical laboratory test adverse reaction .</detailed_description>
