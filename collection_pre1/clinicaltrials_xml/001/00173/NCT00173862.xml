	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy Gemcitabine plus Ifosfamind second line chemotherapy advance transitional cell carcinoma term response rate overall survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Ifosfamide As Second-Line Systemic Chemotherapy Cisplatin -Failed Advanced TCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy produce response rate 40-70 % TCC patient . However , less 10 % patient achieve long-term remission . Until , standard chemotherapy cisplatin-failed TCC patient . Both gemcitabine ifosfamide identify response rate 20 % pretreated TCC patient . It thus reasonable combine two active drug second-line treatment TCC . Patients enrol must pathologically prove urothelial transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) must expose one cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy advance disease . GI regimen continue maximal response .</detailed_description>
