	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) phenotype structure three component : anovulation , hyperandrogenism metabolic syndrome ( hyperinsulinemia , secondary insulin resistance , central abnormality ) ( 1 ) . It common endocrinologic disease see Gynecologic clinic . The follicular excess polycystic ovary failure selection one dominant follicle contribute anovulation PCOS . The infertile PCOS female usually suffer difficult ovulation induction high risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome extensive stimulation . PCOS main androgen disorder woman suggest associated high risk develop cardiovascular disease type-2 diabetes . In many PCOS patient , overweight central obesity generally associate increase fast insulin level , insulin resistance , glucose intolerance , identify target new therapeutic strategy , include early change lifestyle . Insulin resistance , define decrease insulin-mediated glucose utilization , commonly ( 10-25 % ) find normal population . In woman PCOS , insulin resistance appear even common ( 50 % ) , obese non-obese women.Hyperinsulinemia appear play key pathogenic role ovarian androgen overproduction , stimulatory effect insulin ovarian steroid production .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Insulin Resistance PCOS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because menstrual irregularity hirsutism/acne cause hyperandrogenism , treatment choice PCOS young teenager give oral contraceptive ; however , oral contraceptive fail correct endocrinometabolic anomaly excess fat . Therefore , alternative treatment add novel progesterone , claim antimineralocorticoid antiandrogenic activity , give insulin-sensitizing compound metformin . These treatment report effective change endocrinometabolic state adiposity PCOS . Besides , also report efficacy aid ovulation induction . PCOS main androgen disorder woman suggest associated high risk develop cardiovascular disease type-2 diabetes . In many PCOS patient , overweight central obesity generally associate increase fast insulin level , insulin resistance , glucose intolerance , identify target new therapeutic strategy , include early change lifestyle . The plasma concentration adiponectin low men woman different pre- postmenopausal woman . It suggest androgen act reduce plasma adiponectin concentration . In animal experiment , testosterone supplement reduce plasma adiponectin concentration male mouse . In cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes , testosterone 5α-DHT suppressed secretion adiponectin , suggest androgen decrease plasma adiponectin concentration effect adipocytes . Clinical and/or biochemical sign hyperandrogenism one three diagnostic criterion define PCOS . Hyperandrogenemia may cause hirsutism , alopecia , acne , also strongly affect ovulatory function . Some hormone therapy ethinylestradiol cyproterone ethinlyestradiol drosipirenone usually use reduce serum androgen level correct amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea , effect improve endocrine-metabolic state adiposity PCOS still undetermined . Obese woman PCOS know high serum concentration C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , marker inflammation cardiovascular risk factor ; metformin monotherapy reduces CRP level , whereas combine treatment ethinylestradiol cyproterone-acetate raise CRP . Therefore , I interest metformin ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate influence serum adiponectin level . Insulin resistance , define decrease insulin-mediated glucose utilization , commonly ( 10-25 % ) find normal population . In woman PCOS , insulin resistance appear even common ( 50 % ) , obese non-obese woman . Criteria develop define metabolic syndrome PCOS include component associate insulin resistance syndrome include centripetal obesity , hypertension , fast hyperglycemia dyslipidemia . Since serum adiponectin concentration correlate inversely severity insulin resistance well establish , however , adiponectin level woman PCOS still controversial need elucidation . Such Orio et al . suggest insulin sensitivity play pivotal role control adiponectin PCOS woman Ducluzeau et al . mention glucose-to-insulin level well adiponectin predict insulin resistance PCOS . Besides , adiponectin level reduce obese woman PCOS report . Currently clinical trial suggest oral contraceptive plus metformin may reduce adipocytokine imbalance . Hyperinsulinemia appear play key pathogenic role ovarian androgen overproduction , stimulatory effect insulin ovarian steroid production . The mechanism allow ovary remain sensitive insulin classical target organ insulin action ( liver , fat , muscle ) exhibit insulin resistance support presence phosphatidyl inositol 3 ( PI-3 ) kinase independent insulin signal pathway human ovarian cell ( theca granulosa cell ) . Insulin propose directly stimulate activity cytochrome P450c17α , enzyme involved ovarian androgen synthesis find thecal cell .</detailed_description>
