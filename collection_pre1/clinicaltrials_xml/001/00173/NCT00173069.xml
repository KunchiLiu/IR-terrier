	<detailed_description>Project No : 1 Title : A Study Psychopathological Progress Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder specific aim 1 ) To elicit psychopathology identify Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder ( ESLD ) categorize 3 group pre-schizotypal , schizotypal , prodromal ESLD . 2 ) The reveal prevalence different neurobiological impairment ( study Project No.2 ) 3 group identify ESLD subject . 3 ) The stability psychopathology 3 group identify ESLD . 4 ) The process conversion conversion rate psychotic state non-psychotic state 2-year follow-up Study procedure : 1 . Recruitment : The high-risk group schizophrenia recruit referral psychiatric outpatient clinic Northern Taiwan , referral school counseling room Taipei City Taipei County , subject know family history previous schizophrenia genetic study , size 850 family . As good collaborative work several psychiatric hospital psychiatric department general hospital , expect 100 subject could assess outpatient referral . The increase need psychiatric consultation school system give u chance recruit 50 subject school referral ( school counsel system ) . Our previous family genetic study schizophrenia already recruit 850 family . As relatively risk schizophrenic spectrum disorder ( schizophrenia schizotypal disorder ) much high family schizophrenic patient , experience family schizophrenic patient often express worry develop illness , expect 100 subject could assess population . The school surveillance conduct three select senior high school three college Taipei metropolitan aim subject fit recruit indicator , include cognitive decline , affective symptom , social isolation , school failure ( CASIS ) . A pilot study conduct initial 5-10 nominated candidate student cross check validity applicability screen method . There 75,084 senior high school student Academic Year 2003-2004 Taipei City . We plan survey teacher 3000 student 3 senior high school ( around 1000 student ) , represent school highly-academic- , vocational- , mixed-orientation . Another 3000 student recruit 3 college administer freshman self-report questionnaire . It expect 100 subject could identify subject early schizophrenia-like clinical presentation . The general public recruit respondent study ad co-sponsored Mental Health Foundation ( MHF ) frame term highlight awareness early cognitive deficit prevention severe mental disorder ( Caring Brain Worry Free Program ) . As PI recruit subject “ brain bank ” public advocacy Mental Health Foundation already annual survey regard general public ’ mental health condition subjective well-being good response rate result broadcast major medium . Based highly expect credit MHF , expect identify recruit 50 subject channel . The normal control recruit subject ’ schoolmate friend meet recruitment criterion , match age , gender , education . We need 200 normal control subject base two one ration study subject normal control . 2 . Referral criterion : Outpatient group : suspect “ latent ” “ begin ” schizophrenia base psychiatrist ’ clinical experience ; school referral group : problematic student unable explain common conduct problem psychosocial issue teacher ’ perspective ( un-understandable emotional , behavioral , interpersonal , academic problem ) ; family study group : sibling offspring schizophrenic patient exhibit symptoms behavioral pattern warrant family ’ attention ( something remind schizophrenic relative ) . 3 ) Recruitment criterion : ( CASIS ) Cognitive deficit : subjectively poor concentration ; decline intelligence ; inefficient learning ; rigid thinking ; Affective symptom : unexplainable depressiveness , anxiousness , fearfulness , obsession , hypochondriacal idea ; social isolation : le two close friend ; generally withdraw , distant , aloof , isolate ; frequent absence without identifiable cause ; school failure : markedly deterioration academic performance quit school . Subjects present least two condition ( one cognitive deficit least one remain three ) screen psychotic-prone symptom Latent Schizophrenia Screening Sheet ( LSSS ) ( necessary cognitive deficit ) 26 item ( 6 dimension ) include thought , perception , inappropriate behavior , affective symptom , interpersonal relationship , neurotic symptom . Subjects respond “ sure ” item LSS recruit assessment . Anticipated Results : The cross-sectional longitudinal progress psychopathology ESLD reveal . The comprehensiveness domains psychopathology ESLD elicit . The progress process psychopathological domain characterize . 1 . The validity subgrouping ESLD pre-schizotypal , schizotypal prodromal type determine . 2 . We ’ reveal pattern aggravation symptomatic level time go : subject progress severe level 2-year follow-up ( i.e. , pre-schizotypy schizotypy , prodrome SCH , etc ; subject could “ drift back ” milder symptomatic level ( i.e. , prodrome schizotypy schizotypy pre-schizotypy , etc ) . 3 . To determine specific item screening tool , i.e. , LSS , SOPS , well positive predictive value others . 4 . The sensitivity specificity screening tool examine use neurobiological indicator ( Project No.2 ) constrast validity testing . Project No : 2 Title : Neurobiological Study Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder ( ESLD ) Specific Aims : Based neurodevelopmental hypothesis schizophrenia ( SCH ) , assume clinically identify pre-psychotic state SCH , term Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder ( ESLD ) ( Project No.1 ) , may impair neurobiological function . Our previous family-based study also support neurobiological marker , sustain attention deficit , potential endophenotypes schizophrenia ( see background ) . Therefore , Project No.2 Study Psychopathological Progress ESLD ( SOPRES ) Program , plan adopt multi-level approach investigate potential neurobiological change patient ESLD . The approach include certain specific neuropsychological , neurophysiological neuroimaging measurement . The specific aim neuropsychological study follow : 1 ) examine whether individual ESLD evidence control process dysfunction neurocognition ; 2 ) true , explore whether dysfunction involve neurocognitive domain simplex multiplex nature ; 3 ) determine whether neurocognitive control processing measure ( ) use present study useful screen tool ESLD early detection schizophrenia . The specific aim dimension neurobiological study : 1 . To clarify prevalence impaired flush response Niacin skin patch ESLD ass predictive validity Niacin skin test progression schizophrenia ; 2 . To reveal prevalence two brain inhibitory function ( i.e . prepulse inhibition startle ( PPI ) P50 event-related potential ( ERP ) suppression ) ESLD change along clinical course ESLD subject ; 3 . To measure regional change magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) hippocampus frontal lobe subject ESLD , define predictive validity follow-up course . 4 . To measure connectivity diffusion anisotropy hippocampus frontal lobe diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) subject ESLD , define predictive validity follow-up course . 5 . To evaluate possibility skin niacin response/MRS/DTI/P50/PPI endophenotypes genetic research schizophrenia . The importance specific inhibitory measure also reside fact understood neurobiological ( case , molecular ) level , base extensive human animal model study . 1 . P50 Suppression : P50 suppression important endophenotype schizophrenia . P50 suppression occur two click present 500 msec interstimulus interval . The impaired suppression P50 second stimulus report number study chronic schizophrenia patient , medicate unmedicated , first-episode patient , first-degree relative schizophrenic , well schizotypal individual . Impaired P50 suppression extensively study use anatomical molecular genetic neurobiological study . These finding support P50 suppression impairment possible endophenotype information process deficit schizophrenia . 2 . Prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) : PPI startle response operational measure preattentive sensorimotor gating . The term startle modification refers change startle reflex , induce various stimulus modality , startle-eliciting stimulus preceeded ( usually weak ) stimulus call prepulse . It stable time normal subject schizophrenia patient . Deficits PPI consistently identify schizophrenia , PPI excellent candidate endophenotype schizophrenia since PPI deficit occur schizophrenia patient , schizotypal personality disorder patient . To study presence change impair PPI P50 suppression ESLD may help u clarify stability impairment along disease course validity use PPI P50 test screen tool pre-psychotic state schizophrenia . Project No : 3 Title : Family Genetic Study Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder I . Specific Aims : Genetic high-risk ( HR ) approach , subject one affected relative recruit since infancy early childhood , commonly adopt one address early detection schizophrenia ( 1 ) . However , point recent review ( 2 ) , two major limitation study . First , majority genetic high-risk study start 30-40 year ago , many use method outdated sometimes focused less relevant subject assessment . Second , approximately 10 % HR child develop schizophrenia , make prediction concern vulnerability indicator unprecise . Recently alternative approach call clinical high-risk ultra-high-risk advocate , adolescent young adult refer mental health evaluation attenuate psychotic symptom behavioral problem commonly observe HR child recruit prospective follow-up ( 3 , 4 ) . In PPG , propose approach combine genetic HR clinical HR enrich recruitment subject increase risk develop early schizophrenia-like disorder ( ESLD ) . Moreover , interpretation contrast HR subject normal control HR onset schizophrenia HR without onset schizophrenia tend straightforward . Any neurodevelopmental disturbance distribute two independent dimension : genetic-environmental causal continuum early-to-late maturation expression continuum ( 5 ) . A factor present HR subject absent normal control necessarily genetic origin . One way distinguish examine whether similar deficit present non-HR sibling HR proband . However , previous HR study tend measure HR subject family . In component project , propose adopt family-genetic approach provide information interpretation contrast HR different severity normal control HR progression severe stage HR without progression . The specific aim component project follow : Aim 1 : To assess extent psychopathological feature identify probands pre-schizotypal ESLD , schizotypal ESLD , prodromal ESLD , early schizophrenia also present first-degree relative . Aim 2 : To assess extent neurodevelopmental neurobiological impairment identify probands pre-schizotypal ESLD , schizotypal ESLD , prodromal ESLD , early schizophrenia also present first-degree relative . Aim 3 : To assess extent conversion psychotic-like state three group ESLD probands explain presence psychopathological , neurodevelopmental , neurobiological feature observe first-degree relative . The probands three group ESLD ( pre-schizotypal ESLD , schizotypal ESLD , prodromal ESLD ) , early schizophrenia , normal control recruit Component Project 1 PPG . On basis probands , Component Project recruit first-degree relative participate study . Part probands neurobiological assessment conduct Component Project 2 . Part family identify Component Project evaluate help-seeking behavior . In joined effort , able decipher psychopathological pathway genetic environmental etiological factor .
