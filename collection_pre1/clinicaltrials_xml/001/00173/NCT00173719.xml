	<brief_title>Influence Assistive Device Use While Performing Dual Task Patients With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research show effectiveness use ambulatory assistive device increase stand stability patient stroke clinical practice ( Maeda et al. , 2001 ) . However , literature also suggest manipulation ambulatory assistive device dynamic motor task , walk , inevitably require additional attention , even healthy adult ( Wright &amp; Kemp , 1992 ) . Given majority patient stroke suffer balance control difficulty , subsequently increase attentional demand associate maintain balance ( Brown et al. , 2002 ) , remain important question whether use ambulatory assistive device would take away attentional resource would otherwise used maintain balance .</detailed_description>
