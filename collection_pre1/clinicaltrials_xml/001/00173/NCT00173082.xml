	<detailed_description>Primary aldosteronism ( PA ) occasionally associate impaired glucose tolerance . Glucose intolerance , general metabolic syndrome cause suppression insulin release pancreas suppression insulin sensitivity target tissue . Several study suggest impaired glucose tolerance primary aldosteronism due inability beta cell release insulin potassium depletion . It suggest glucose intolerance PA cause suppression insulin release relate hypopotassemia compensatory increase insulin sensitivity observe PA . The increased insulin secretory capacity associate correction negative potassium balance may account increase plasma leptin cure primary aldosteronism . The conclusion respect possible causal relationship DM PA , however , obtain evaluation effect surgical /pharmacological treatment PA. From July 2005 July 2008 , patient primary aldosteronism , hospitalize comprehensive study subtypes primary aldosteronism operation receive inform consent insulin sensitivity test . In present study , measure insulin sensitivity via ability release insulin 75 g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) PA clarify mechanism glucose intolerance PA. Seventy-five gram OGTT perform PA adrenalectomy . Within one minute , 75 g glucose dissolve 200 cc water ingest . Venous blood sample draw 0 , 60 , 120 minute determination plasma glucose plasma insulin level . Serum potassium level measure 0 minute . Furthermore , adipokines , HOMA , QUICKI , leptin , adiponectin , homocystine , C-reactive protein , proinflammatory cytokine adhesion molecule also measure .</detailed_description>
