	<detailed_description>Patients late-stage NSCLC often symptomatic , specific pulmonary problem ( eg , cough , breathlessness , hemoptysis ) general symptom ( eg . fatigue , weight loss ) cause extreme distress patient . Therefore , improvement disease-related symptom quality life ( QoL ) key desire outcomes medical management.7 Effective , palliative , low-toxicity reasonable treatment cost patient advance NSCLC need . Recently , country consider evidence economic value along clinical efficacy . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) promise target anticancer therapy express highly express variety tumor , include NSCLC . 8,9 Furthermore , high level EGFR expression associate poor prognosis lung cancer patient several study . 10-12 EGFR-targeted cancer therapy currently develop ; strategy include inhibition intracellular tyrosine kinase domain receptor small molecule gefitinib ( Iressa [ ZD1839 ] ; AstraZeneca , Wilmington , DE ) .13 Iressa orally active , selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor block signal transduction pathway implicate proliferation survival cancer cell .</detailed_description>
