	<detailed_description>CD44 cell surface receptor extracellular matrix hyaluronan . It mediate adhesion cell extracellular matrix . Its ability organize extracellular matrix medium also use cancer cell become metastatic . Invasive tumor cell frequently observe bind hyaluronate . CD44 gene make 20 exon , least 10 variably express due alternative splice mRNA . The standard form , CD44s , cod sequence exon 1-5 16-20 . Variant isoforms ( CD44v ) , large , arise alternative splice combination exon 6-15 ( v1-10 ) . A variant isoform CD44 induce metastasis rat pancreatic carcinoma . Studies human tumor , however , produce variable result . Some breast cancer demonstrate positive correlation CD44v expression tumor progression , others lack correlation . Some colorectal tumor even show inverse correlation . CD44 also demonstrate metastasis suppressor gene prostate cancer . Thus , CD44 may marker metastasis tumor , others , may actually metastasis suppressor gene yet another group tumor . For primary lung cancer , correlation CD44 expression tumor metastasis establish . The metastasis-prone small cell lung cancer rarely show immunohistochemical stain CD44s CD44v . For non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , study show positive correlation immunohistochemical CD44v expression tumor progression , others show correlation . Our study use RT-PCR , sequence immunohistochemical staining show pulmonary adenocarcinoma , CD44v6 expression down-regulated disease progress . Based finding , observation CD44s CD44v expression low metastasis-prone small cell lung cancer , assue CD44 metastasis suppressor gene inactivate lung cancer . Because prostate cancer DNA hypermethylation show related down-regulation CD44 gene , plan study methylation status transcriptional regulatory region CD44 gene primary lung cancer . We â€™ study CD44 expression immunohistochemistry , methylation status CD44 regulatory region sequence bisulfite-modified genomic DNA , correlate two finding , histologic type , tumor stag survival .</detailed_description>
