	<brief_summary>Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) emerge infectious disease cause novel coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) . The major clinical feature SARS include fever , dyspnea , lymphopenia , rapid progression pulmonary infiltrates chest radiologic image . The SARS-related death result mainly pulmonary complication , include progressive respiratory failure due alveolar damage acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . Pathological change SARS suggest SARS sequelae infiltration PMN lung tissue , multiple organ dysfunction ARDS associate cytokine chemokine dysregulation . Some patient still manifest lung injury time viral load fall also support immune nature lung damage . We therefore undertook analysis dynamic production cytokine/chemokines SARS patient initial normal chest radiograph order improve understanding disease pathogenesis improve patient management .</brief_summary>
