	<brief_title>Mutation Analysis 17βhydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase 3 Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>17βhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 ( 17βHSD3 ) deficiency rare cause male pseudohermaphroditism . The incidence report 1 : 147,000 Netherlands . Fewer one hundred affected 46 , XY male report literature , case report Taiwan . The 46 , XY patient ambiguious complete female external genitalia . They mostly unrecognized birth rear female . They often draw medical attention receive operation inguinal hernia puberty , clitoromegaly musculization notice . However , homozygous compound heterozygous genetic female asymptomatic . The 17βHSD3 catalyze conversion androstenedione testosterone , last step synthesis testosterone . Therefore , serum level androstenedione elevate testosterone dihydrotestosterone low range affect 46 , XY individual . The clinical diagnosis make HCG stimulation test , androstenedione-to-testosterone ratio abnormally elevate patient . But molecular basis 17βHSD3 deficiency determine till recent decade . The HSD17B3 gene elucidate 1994 , compose 11 exon . Several missence mutation splice mutation identify . But precise action tissue distribution 17βHSD3 still need clarify . The Wölffian duct virilze normally embryonic stage serum concentration testosterone achieve normal range pubertal stage . The exact mechanism understand clearly peripheral conversion isozymes suggest study . The purpose study disclose molecular pathology 3 family 17βHSD3 deficiency .</detailed_description>
