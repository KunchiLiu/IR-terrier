	<brief_summary>The specific aim research delineate follow : Aim 1 : To investigate neuromuscular biomechanical mechanism emerge process proactive reactive balance control sit stand patient stroke different stage recovery course . Aim 2 : To determine relationship brain lesion sit recovery pattern reactive proactive balance control mechanisms patient stroke . Aim 3 : To determine relationship impairment reactive proactive balance control mechanisms functional outcome well fall incidence patient follow stroke . Aim 4 : To investigate efficacy different training regimen improve reactive proactive balance control strategies prevent fall stroke patient different brain lesion site . Principally , three hypothesis test : Hypothesis 1 : The emerge process recovery patternes proactive reactive balance control may different among stroke patient different brain lesion location . Hypothesis 2 : There positive correlation level impairment reactive proactive balance control mechanisms functional outcome well fall incidence patient follow stroke . Hypothesis 3 : Training regimen could best facilitate emergence improvement reactive proactive balance control strategies different .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke one lead cause chronic disability world . Falls one primary complication stroke . The incidence fall range 25 % 75 % among stroke patient reside different setting , great incidence fall occur discharge home . Postural instability suggest one main cause lead falls population . The recovery ability maintain balance activity daily live , therefore , essential functional independence safety patient . In follow paragraph , knowledge gap taht propose bridge study revelant literature lead u identify gap discuss .</detailed_description>
