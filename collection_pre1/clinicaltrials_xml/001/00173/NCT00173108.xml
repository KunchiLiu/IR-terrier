	<brief_summary>The first aim develop clinic-based intervention program home-based intervention program VLBW preterm infant common intervention service respectively deliver clinic home . The intervention comprehensive combine child- parent-focused service include health feeding consultation , education child development skill , intervention mother-infant interaction , parent support . The eleven-session intervention intensive begin hospitalization end 12 month correct age . The clinical feasibility usefulness implement intervention program within context randomize intervention study subject exist constraint hospital home setting test pilot study . The second aim conduct randomize control trial examine cost effectiveness UCP , CBIP , HBIP VLBW preterm infant . Gender socio-economically match normal full-term infant also include comparison group . Outcome measure include child , parent , transaction outcome compare group . Child outcome measure include health status , growth , neurodevelopment , neurosensory status ; parent outcome measure include maternal parenting competence , social support , psychological stress ; transaction outcome measure mother-infant interaction . Costs ( direct indirect cost ) associate early intervention program follow-up period estimate . Average incremental cost/effectiveness ratio calculate determine early intervention program cost-effective VLBW preterm infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preterm birth low birth weight ( VLBW ) ( gestational age &lt; 37 week birth weight &lt; 1,501 g ) significant public health problem worldwide . Longitudinal follow-up study show VLBW preterm infant require prolonged hospitalization substantial risk various morbidity neonatal period bear normal birth weight . Furthermore , approximately 40 % VLBW preterm infant burden adverse outcome chronic health problem re-hospitalizations , low IQ , developmental delay , behavioral problem , poor educational achievement . Accumulating data collect Western develop country suggest comprehensive intensive early intervention may beneficial preterm infant family . However , little information concern early intervention attempt infant family Taiwan . The purpose study therefore examine cost-effectiveness three early intervention program i.e. , usual care program , clinic-based intervention program , home-based intervention program VLBW preterm infant . In preliminary study , survey need intervention service follow hospital discharge VLBW preterm infant ( N=69 ) family . All mother express need service 60 ( 87 % ) prefer service delivery home 9 ( 13 % ) prefer service delivery neonatal follow-up clinic . The intervention service specifically identify health respiratory assistance ( N=22 ) , feed assistance ( N=17 ) , education child development skill ( N=12 ) , parent support ( N=8 ) . Based survey data result previous intervention study , develop propose research project clinic-based intervention program home-based intervention program common intervention service respectively deliver via clinic visit home visit . The intervention comprehensive combine child- parent-focused service include health feeding consultation , education child development skill , intervention mother-infant interaction , parent support . The eleven-session intervention intensive begin hospitalization end 12 month correct age . This four-year research project employ single blind , randomize experimental design examine efficacy early intervention program VLBW preterm infant . For first year , develop clinic-based intervention program home-based intervention program actual situation examine clinical usefulness . From second fourth year , 180 VLBW preterm infant bear admitted neonatal intensive care unit National Taiwan University Hospital MacKay Memorial Hospital randomly assign usual care program , clinic-based intervention program , home-based intervention program . Sixty gender socio-economically match normal full-term infant also include comparison group . Child , parent , transaction outcome assess infant 4 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month correct age . Child outcomes measure health status , growth , neurodevelopment , neurosensory status ; parent outcome measure maternal parenting competence , social support , psychological stress ; transaction outcome measure mother-infant interaction . Generalized estimate equation use examine difference change outcome variable intervention control group . At end fourth year , cost effectiveness three intervention program compare determine one cost-effective VLBW preterm infant Taiwan . The result study help clinician parent understand efficacy early intervention VLBW preterm infant . Furthermore , data study provide important information policy maker health administrator concern resource allocation early intervention forVLBW preterm infant Taiwan .</detailed_description>
