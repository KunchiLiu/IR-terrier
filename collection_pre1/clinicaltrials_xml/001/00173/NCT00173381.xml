	<brief_title>The Role Lymphangiogenesis Head Neck Cancer Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck cancer major , worldwide cause morbidity mortality . As long neoplasm confine organ origin , patient cure surgical removal tumor mass . Unfortunately , many cancer metastasize site body , metastasis lead cause death cancer patient . In principle , cancer cell spread within body different mechanism , direct invasion surround tissue ( per continuitatem ) , spread via blood vascular system ( hematogenous metastasis ) spread via lymphatic system ( lymphatic metastasis ) . Tumor cell invade either blood lymphatic vessel access general circulation establish tissue . Clinicopathological data suggest lymphatics initial route spread solid tumor . Infiltration lymphatic vessel tumor cell find periphery many experimental human tumor , lymphatic system recognize conduit tumor cell dissemination . Though significance angiogenesis tumor progression well document , molecular mechanism regulate growth function lymphatic vessel largely unknown . Vascular endothelial growth factor , first identified 1989 , well-known angiogenic agent target anti-cancer therapy . Now appear VEGF-C , one recently-cloned member vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) family , also involved developmental tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis . VEGF signal two tyrosine kinase receptor , VEGFR-1 VEGFR-2 , express predominantly exclusively vascular endothelial cell . As neither VEGFR-1 VEGFR-2 appear highly express lymphatic endothelium , surprising third VEGF receptor , VEGFR-3 , find predominantly express lymphatic vessel development . What surprising , however , VEGF find bind VEGFR-3 . Instead , VEGF-C discover ligand VEGFR-3 . Research group provide direct evidence VEGF-C important regulator lymph vessel growth ( lymphangiogenesis ) vivo also enhance lymphatic metastasis . Using experimental approach , Mäkinen et al. , Skobe et al. , well Mandriota et al . demonstrate important role VEGFR-3 ligand , VEGF-C , developmental tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis . In normal adult human tissue , VEGF-C receptor VEGFR-3 ( FLT-4 ) predominantly express lymphatic endothelium . Expression VEGF-C occur variety human tumor breast , colon , lung , thyroid , gastric , squamous cell cancer , mesothelioma , neuroblastomas , sarcomas melanoma . Moreover , expression VEGF-C mRNA recently show correlate rate metastasis lymph node breast , colorectal , gastric , thyroid , lung prostate cancer . To date , however , lymphangiogenesis causally link tumor metastasis . Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) enzyme catalyze synthesis prostaglandin . COX-2 immediate-early response gene induced inflammation , growth factor , tumor promoter , oncogene , carcinogen . Increased level COX-2 may contribute carcinogenesis modulate xenobiotic metabolism , apoptosis , immune surveillance , angiogenesis . Any significant increase tumor mass must precede increase vascular supply deliver nutrient oxygen tumor . Recently , level COX-2 find correlate VEGF expression tumor vascularization HNSCC . This finding human tissue consistent prior evidence overexpression COX-2 epithelial cell lead enhanced production VEGF formation capillary-like network . Although COX-2 contributes regulation angiogenesis , role lymphangiogenesis clear . IL-6 secrete , multifunctional glycoprotein . Through bind α-chain ( IL-6-R , gp80 ) subsequently recruit β-chain ( gp130 ) receptor , IL-6 performs various biological function . The diversity IL-6 signaling mediate via gp130 explain functional pleiotropy . IL-6 regulate inflammatory reaction , immune response , hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis , several important physiological process . Interestingly , influence IL-6 human cancer vary depend cell type . For example , IL-6 demonstrate promote growth multiple myeloma , Kaposi 's sarcoma , prostatic cancer cell , inhibit proliferation lung breast cancer cell . Previous investigation confirm IL-6 important physiological pathological angiogenesis . Additionally , recent study support hypothesis IL-6 facilitate tumorigenesis cervical cancer via VEGF-mediated angiogenesis . Nevertheless , whether IL-6 could regulate expression VEGF-C role lymphangiogenesis still need clarify . Inhibition angiogenesis currently consider one promising therapeutic strategy inhibit cancer growth presumably act tumor type , induce resistance tumor cell ( therefore use repeat therapeutic cycle ) little effect normal tissue . It need determined whether hold true tumor lymphangiogenesis . Metastases head neck cancer occur frequently lymphatic system , extent lymph node involvement key prognostic factor disease . In study , conduct systematic analysis VEGF-C , COX-2 IL-6 expression try find correlation expression , lymphatic metastasis patient survival . Next , investigate relationship VEGF-C , COX-2 IL-6 , clarify effect tumor growth . Undoubtedly , finding study help u understand whether lymphangiogenesis could focal point anti-cancer research . If HNSCC tumor express high level VEGF-C show consistently high incidence lymphatic metastasis , inhibition VEGFR-3 function may novel approach inhibit lymphatic metastasis patient .</detailed_description>
