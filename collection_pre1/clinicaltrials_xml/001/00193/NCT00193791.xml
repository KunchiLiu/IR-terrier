	<brief_summary>A study evaluate efficacy concomitant chemoradiation compare radiotherapy alone . Concomitant chemoradiation new treatment modality carcinoma cervix . Studies show improvement survival chemoradiation , majority patient early stage . Since treatment modality test adequately advanced stage set , present study undertaken . The study arm chemoradiation potential improve survival 10 % , associate additional 5 % risk toxicity , treatable . In study arm , apart form standard radiotherapy treatment , receive weekly chemotherapy injection ( Cisplatin ) external radiation therapy . The study arm associate additional 5 % acute hematological gastrointestinal toxicity , treatable medication , blood transfusion , modification ongoing treatment etc .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concomitant Chemoradiation Advanced Stage Carcinoma Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carcinoma cervix commonest malignancy see Asian woman constitute approximately 30 % cancer ( 1 ) . It also lead cause cancer mortality India . Nearly 50 % patient present advanced stage ( FIGO Stage III/IV ) . The main stay treatment traditionally radical radiation therapy decade survival rate achieve plateau 30 - 45 % 5 year . In develop country socioeconomic problem , illiteracy , late presentation irregular follow-up compromise survival . Over last decade study use chemo-radiotherapy carcinoma cervix . Over 19 randomized trial publish address issue chemo-radiotherapy . However , heterogeneous data , poor randomization , inadequate number patient , sub-optimal radiotherapy , non-uniform use chemotherapeutic drug , sequence poor documentation yet provide evidence substantially alter practice . Hence , meta-analysis trial undertaken evaluate role chemo-radiotherapy carcinoma cervix ( 2,3 ) . The first meta-analysis publish Cochrane Collaborative Group 4580 randomize patient ( 19 randomize trial ) suggest chemo-radiation show absolute survival benefit improvement progression free overall survival 16 % 12 % respectively ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . The survival significantly well Cisplatin base concomitant chemo-radiation ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . Incidentally , distant metastasis rate also significantly low chemo-radiation ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . However , benefit see early stage . In addition , acute grade 3/4 hematological gastro-intestinal toxicity higher chemo-radiation ( additional 8 % 5 % respectively ) . The data insufficient report late toxicity ( 2 ) . The second meta-analysis 9 randomized trial , recently publish Canadian Group evaluate cisplatin base concomitant chemo-radiation confirms improvement overall survival ( 4year survival data ) advance stage , bulky IB tumor ( prior surgery ) high risk early disease ( post-surgery ) . Although acute grade 3/4 hematological gastro-intestinal toxicity higher chemo-radiation , short-lived , 2 death remain resolve medical treatment . There significant increase late toxicity data available . Both Cochrane Canadian meta-analysis large extent try address role concomitant chemo-radiation , Carcinoma Cervix Stage III account 30-35 % moreover evaluation optimal radiation schedule comparison late toxicity still remain unanswered . What important cisplatin relatively inexpensive available worldwide . This mean cisplatin-based chemo-radiation affordable develop country carcinoma cervix still form major cancer . However , role chemo-radiation Carcinoma Cervix Stage IIIB develop country include India still remain unexplored . We propose randomize study evaluate role benefit chemo-radiation in-patients cervical cancer .</detailed_description>
