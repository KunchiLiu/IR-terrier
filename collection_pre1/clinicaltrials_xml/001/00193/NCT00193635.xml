	<detailed_description>Sustained activation immune system may contribute progressive renal injury form chronic kidney disease . There extensive proliferation renal tubular epithelial cell fibroblast within kidney patient chronic renal failure ( CRF ) . The fibroblast manifest activate myofibroblast phenotype , evidence expression alpha smooth muscle actin . This change accompany infiltration renal interstitium macrophage , lymphocyte , immunocompetent cell . The cell also activate release numerous cytokine inflammatory mediator . These substance exacerbate injury process recruit additional immunoeffector cell kidney parenchyma stimulate production secretion pro-inflammatory molecule . These finding suggest immunosuppressive medication may beneficial treatment congenital uropathy . In fact , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) ( 10-30 mg/kg/day ) give rat subject 5/6 nephrectomy . Uremia remnant kidney model consequence primary immunological disease . MMF treatment 30-60 day prevent intraglomerular hypertension alteration renal hemodynamics characterize adaptation reduce renal mass . However , extensive infiltration renal interstitium proliferate lymphocyte markedly attenuate MMF treatment . Moreover , despite relatively selective anti-metabolic effect MMF lymphocytes , significant reduction macrophage infiltration tubulointerstitium . This beneficial change associate significant reduction albuminuria glomerulosclerosis 60 day MMF treatment . Combined treatment MMF angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , lisinopril , rat reduce renal mass diminish tubulointerstitial infiltration macrophage T cell even MMF therapy alone nearly normalized urinary protein excretion . Thus , pharmacological treatment MMF attenuate progression `` nonimmunological '' renal disease remnant kidney model without favorably impact intraglomerular hemodynamics hypertrophic response peptide growth factor . MMF well-tolerated , safe , effective immunosuppressive medication adult pediatric recipient cadaveric living-related renal transplant . HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC AIMS This open-label pilot study design test hypothesis sustain activation immunoeffector system mediate progressive loss renal function child congenital uropathy . Immunosuppressive therapy inhibit process retard rate decline kidney function pediatric patient structural , non-immunological kidney condition . Specific Aim # 1 : Determine whether administration mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) pediatric patient glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 50 ml/min/m2 due congenital uropathy dysplasia/hypoplasia , obstructive uropathy , reflux nephropathy safe well tolerate . Specific Aim # 2 : Determine whether administration mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) diminish rate progressive decline GFR frequency ESRD pediatric patient glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 50 ml/min/m2 due congenital uropathy . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Clinical Definitions CRF : GFR &lt; 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 Congenital uropathy : One follow category kidney disease : 1 . Dysplasia/hypoplasia 2 . Congenital obstructive uropathy : This category include child born structural abnormality associate renal parenchymal damage , e.g . Prune-Belly syndrome , posterior urethral valve , myelomeningocele . 3 . Reflux nephropathy 4 . Hereditary non-immunological tubular disorder The threshold CRF select enable recruitment sufficient number patient pilot study timely fashion . In addition , stage disease course , renal function expect decline relatively short follow-up period . Patients degree CRF nearly 40 % chance require dialysis transplant within 2 year . This increase possibility demonstrate therapeutic benefit secondary treatment MMF . The diagnosis congenital urological disease establish base upon appropriate use radiological imaging test , necessary , surgical procedure . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Age : 3-16 year 2 . Congenital uropathy 3 . Presence CRF The low age limit enable enrollment child reasonably cooperative , able take liquid MMF preparation orally twice day , iothalamate clearance perform without require bladder catheterization . The upper limit age enable subject complete 2-year study protocol prior 18 year age , standard cut-off enrollment pediatric clinical trial . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Diagnosed primary hepatic , hematological , immunological disease HIV infection may increase potential risk MMF 2 . Known sensitivity MMF 3 . Glomerular disease define clinical histopathological ground The rate decline estimate GFR 6 month prior entry study record patient . However , value serve exclusion criterion . Even patient evidence rapid decline GFR , i.e . &gt; 25 % previous 6 month , eligible . Such rapid deterioration unlikely occur child congenital uropathy enrol pilot study , base natural history form kidney disease . Sample Population It anticipate 12 patient enrol approximately 4 center multicenter open-label pilot study MMF child CRF due congenital uropathy . Proposed Intervention MMF All patient treat MMF open-label pilot study . Study Phases There two phase open-label pilot study : 1 . RUN-IN ( 2 month ) : Informed consent obtain parent eligible patient begin phase study . Assent obtain accord IRB regulation participate center . During 2-month Run-In period , eligible patient take medication contraindicate protocol ( see , Adjunctive Treatments ) . At discretion attend pediatric nephrologist , child may place ACE inhibitor drug . The dose must stabilize 4 week prior onset Treatment Period . 2 . TREATMENT ( 24 month ) : GFR measure iothalamate clearance start end 12-month Treatment Period . Patients whose estimate GFR &lt; 50 ml/min/1.73 M2 Run-in Period include regardless GFR determination use iothalamate clearance begin Treatment Period . This reflect prevail clinical practice GFR routinely determine use formula estimate rather precise clearance method . HIV test do first visit Treatment Period MMF treatment commence HIV-negative status eligible patient confirm . MMF Dosing The target therapeutic dosage MMF 600 mg/m2 body surface area/dose , maximum dose 1 g , give orally twice day . MMF start 200 mg/m2 BID increase biweekly interval . The full treatment dose , 600 mg/m2 BID , achieve 4 week . Safety parameters The dose adjust downward 200 mg/m2/BID child develop gastrointestinal complaint , anemia ( hematocrit &lt; 25 % ) , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 1,000-1,500 . If 1 week GI toxicity continue laboratory study remain abnormal , dose reduce decrement 200 mg/m2/BID . If problem persist subsequently , drug stop . In case severe toxicity , rapid reduction MMF allow attend pediatric nephrologist 's discretion . If ANC le 1000 , drug stop . The need discontinue MMF treatment 20 % study patient consider unacceptable high frequency MMF intolerance pilot trial . Adjunctive treatment The use ACE inhibitor contraindicate patient enrol study . However , agent must start prior enrollment trial initial dose increase remainder 2-year study protocol . Administration recombinant human growth hormone child enroll pilot study permit attend pediatric nephrologist already prescribe . In addition , patient may receive erythropoietin treat anemia prevent need red blood cell transfusion . Supplemental dose antioxidant vitamin E contraindicate study participant . In addition , patient trial give immunosuppressive therapy . All treatment leave discretion attend pediatric nephrologist . Clinical Assessment Pre-enrollment , interval final visit : CLINICAL : BP , urine protein : creatinine ratio ( Upr/c ) , microalbuminuria ( Ualb/cr ) , iothalamate clearance IMMUNOLOGICAL : HIV test initial visit . NUTRITION : Counseling provide RDA protein 125 % RDA calories All serum urine sample store -70 degree C analysis future test new clinical research finding indicate value perform novel assay ass disease progression child congenital uropathy . Frequency interval assessment Run-in Period : Monthly x 2 Treatment Period : Monthly x 3 Then every 3 month duration study Primary Endpoints 1 . Safety MMF child congenital uropathy 2 . Frequency ESRD child congenital uropathy Anticipated finding It predict MMF well tolerate least 80 % ( 10 12 ) child congenital uropathy GFR &lt; 50 ml/min/1.73m2 . It also anticipate MMF reduce incidence ESRD 50 % , thus , 2 12 patient treat MMF protocol require dialysis transplant . Timeline pilot study It anticipate take 3 month set Administrative Center Schneider Children Hospital , design Clinical Reporting Forms , create database Data Coordinating Center . Patients would recruit next 3 month . In order complete 2-year Treatment Period , entire study would last 3½ year .</detailed_description>
