	<brief_title>RADAR Trial - Randomised Androgen Deprivation Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally androgen deprivation ( orchidectomy , recently medication ) reserve palliative treatment men advance , incurable prostate cancer . However , evidence large scale trial begin suggest androgen deprivation ( AD ) may helpful prevent relapse patient localise disease treat surgically radiotherapy . Of 8000 patient per annum treat curative intent , one half ( 4000 ) cancer 'adjuvant ' AD may prescribe accord interpretation register indication . There , however , enormous variation prescribe practice reflect uncertainty appropriate indication . An important issue osteopenia . The increase use AD men earlier stage cancer , whose life expectancy exceed 3 year , expose many unwanted metabolic sequela prolong AD , important osteopenia . In 1996 , fund support NHMRC pharmaceutical industry , TROG therefore launch large randomise three-arm trial . Two arm repeat two arm US Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 86.01 trial , time , show early indication benefit addition two month maximal androgen deprivation ( MAD ) , use Goserelin ( Zoladex ) Flutamide , radiation therapy one month . Since work Canada indicate continued AD period longer three month produce additional shrinkage prostatic tumour , TROG 96.01 trial incorporated third arm : six month MAD prior radiotherapy . The trial complete recruitment target 800 eligible patient early 2000 . Although August 2001 median follow time still short , preliminary analysis indicate significant increase time biochemical relapse produce AD . In fact , benefit AD independent stage , tumour grade initial PSA value confirm also predict time biochemical failure . The hazard relapse reduce 0.75 ( 0.55 - 0.97 , 95 % confidence interval ) 3 month AD , still 0.6 ( 0.45 - 0.82 ) six month AD . Subsequent international development area research encourage design 'follow ' trial . A European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) trial report 3 year adjuvant ( 'post hoc ' ) AD ( use Goserelin alone ) , administer radiotherapy , reduce relapse improve survival patient locally advanced prostate cancer . The US Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 85.31 trial indicate indefinite Goserelin administration radiotherapy reduce treatment failure rate site compare radiotherapy alone . The RTOG 92.02 trial show 24 month adjuvant Goserelin also reduce failure rate patient treat 4 month MAD prior radiotherapy . Subset analyse RTOG trial , suggest patient gain prolonged AD term survival high grade cancer . It therefore logical TROG propose second trial intention find whether additional 12 month AD administer radiotherapy ( aka 'intermediate term ' AD [ ITAD ] ) would reduce relapse mortality patient treat six month AD prior radiotherapy ( aka 'short term ' AD [ STAD ] ) 'best ' arm first ( 96.01 ) trial . The availability potent bisphosphonate , zoledronic acid , also make possible find whether osteopenia induce two arm propose second trial would prevent second random assignment 18 month ' bisphosphonate therapy ( BP ) . This randomised phase III multicentre clinical trial . After informed consent give eligibility check patient randomise one four trial arm : 1 . 6 month androgen blockade LH-RH analogue ( 5 month start radiotherapy ) ( STAD ) , 2 . 18 month androgen blockade LH-RH analogue ( start 5 month start radiotherapy ) ( ITAD ) , 3 . 18 month therapy zoledronic acid 4 mg intravenous infusion every 3 month 18 month begin concurrently STAD 4 . 18 month therapy zoledronic acid begin concurrently ITAD . Stratification accord follow criterion : T2 / T3 , 4 Gleason score 2 - 6 / 7+ Presenting PSA &lt; 10 / 10 - 20 / &gt; 20 Treatment centre Radiation Treatment deliver use conventional technique , unless treatment centre participate clinician demonstrates ability deliver treatment use CRT , IMRT , HDRB technique verify trial TACT . Drug Treatment : LH-RH analogue ( LH-RHa ) ( Leuprorelin acetate 22.5 mg ) deliver depot injection every 3 month . This administer Intramuscular injection ( IMI ) . Zoledronic acid 4 mg deliver intravenous infusion 15 minute every 3 month 18 month , patient randomise therapy . No placebo therapy give patient randomise 'no bisphosphonate therapy ' treatment arm .</detailed_description>
