	<brief_summary>A study evaluate efficacy Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) compare Standard Conventional Radiotherapy Alone treatment carcinoma cervix . Concomitant Weekly Cisplatin chemotherapy give routine , standard care today early stage cervical cancer include stage IIB . The benefit use IMRT reduce radiation-induced toxicity well know . Since treatment modality yet validate studied randomized trial setting , present study undertaken . The study arm IMRT potential reduce toxicity 15-20 % , associate labor intense procedure require many hospital visit actual start treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) With Conventional Radiation Therapy Stage IIB Carcinoma Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carcinoma Cervix common malignancy see Indian woman constitute approximately 10 % cancer Tata Memorial Hospital ( 1 ) . It also lead cause cancer mortality India . Nearly 85 % patient present advanced stage ( FIGO Stage II/III ) . The main stay treatment traditionally radical radiation therapy 80-90 % patient require radiation lifetime decade survival rate achieve plateau 30 - 55 % 5 year . Radiation therapy usually combination external beam intracavitary brachytherapy . External beam radiation include irradiation primary tumor nodal area risk . Higher Doses external beam radiation limit due normal critical organ namely , small bowel , rectum bladder . A major concern pelvic radiation considerable volume small bowel rectum include radiation treatment field . Unsurprisingly , gastrointestinal radiation reaction include diarrhea late sequela include small bowel obstruction , enteritis diarrhea common ( 2-4 ) . The benefit multiple field , high energy beam , customize block low fraction size well know ( 4 ) . Various method use reduce small bowel complication . Surgical method include absorbable mesh ( 5 ) , tissue expanders ( 6 ) omentoplasty ( 7 ) . However , approach feasible patient undergo definitive radiation . Apart small bowel toxicity , late rectal bladder complication also major concern . The clinical manifestation vary mild proctitis , stricture , bleed ulcer fistula formation hemorrhagic cystitis require cystectomy . Grade III radiation cystitis proctitis report range 3-15 % radiation alone . Moreover , late pattern practice increasingly emphasize concomitant chemo radiation ( 8,9 ) . The addition chemotherapy though doubt improve survival , also lead increase normal tissue toxicity . In RTOG 90-01 92-10 alarm increase gastro intestinal ( 35 % grade III grade IV ) genitourinary ( 9 % grade III grade IV ) . The change treatment policy toxicity associate wide pelvic radiation therapy demand well normal tissue spar radiation technique radioprotective agent . Three Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy ( 3D-CRT ) extent successfully achieve normal tissue spar . Intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) important recent advance radiation therapy forefront Translational Research . With 3DCRT radiation intensity generally uniform within radiation portal whereas IMRT dose intensity within portal varies use beamlets , thereby allow high degree conformation tumor previously possible allows concave isodose profile generate . Over last 10 year , IMRT successfully use treatment prostate , head neck brain tumor . IMRT pelvic radiation potential reduce dose well volume rectum , bladder small bowel irradiate significantly thereby translate decrease incidence severity , acute late gastro-intestinal genito-urinary toxicity . Several dosimetric study report confirm role IMRT reduce toxicity pelvic radiation therapy ( 10,11 ) . These dosimetric study report volume small bowel irradiate prescription dose factor 2 compare conventional radiation . The average volume bladder rectum irradiate also reduce 23 % ( 12 ) . In series 10 patient treat , IMRT pelvic radiation therapy apart reduce hot spot volume well conformity index target volume , also significantly reduce volumes high dose region small bowel region ( 17 % ) , rectum ( 50-60 % ) bladder ( 40-50 % ) [ unpublished data ] . In another series early report outcome 40 patient treat IMRT whole pelvis , Arno el al . demonstrate significant reduction acute radiation related toxicity , early comment late sequelae since follow-up short conclude , novel approach definitely need validated trial setting .
