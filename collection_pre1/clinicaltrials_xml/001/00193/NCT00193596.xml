	<detailed_description>Upon determination eligibility , patient randomly assign one two treatment arm : - Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Etoposide - Irinotecan + Gemcitabine Patients stratify tumor location ( liver/bone versus others ) number metastatic site ( one versus two ) . Patients objective response stable disease completion chemotherapy receive ZD1839 disease progression . Patients respond chemotherapy may crossover chemotherapy regimen receive ZD1839 objective response stable disease . The study blind patient doctor know treatment assign .</detailed_description>
