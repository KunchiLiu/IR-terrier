	<brief_summary>One basic principle cancer chemotherapy drug act exclusively mainly cell cycle . Estrogens show increase fraction breast cancer cell cycle . Tamoxifen hand , decrease proliferative fraction show negatively impact result adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer give concomitantly . A number previous study attempt estrogenic recruitment cancer cell ( cell cycle ) increase efficacy chemotherapy locally advanced metastatic breast cancer . Although study show increase response rate recruitment arm , benefit time progression survival study . These result may due inadequate sample size study advance stage disease ( presumably high fraction inherently chemoresistant cell ) . The present study design test hypothesis estrogenic recruitment micrometastatic disease operable breast cancer increase efficacy standard adjuvant chemotherapy surgery . The intervention arm study involve administration short duration estrogen prior cycle adjuvant chemotherapy . The end-points disease free overall survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Estrogen Priming Increase Efficacy Adjuvant Chemotherapy Operable Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results recent clinical study ( 1 ) show tamoxifen administer concurrently chemotherapy reduces efficacy latter patient estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer . Tamoxifen exert anti-tumour efficacy breast cancer primarily anti-estrogenic effect breast tissue . Anti-estrogenic effect tamoxifen mediate competitive inhibition estrogen receptor , result reduce transcription estrogen-regulated gene ( 2 ) . This result blockade cell cycle transit G1 phase inhibition tumour growth . This mechanism action might theoretical basis negative effect concomitantly administer tamoxifen efficacy adjuvant chemotherapy could explain thus : Most human solid tumour grow ( regress ) follow Gompertzian kinetics rather exponential one ( 3 ) . The fundamental difference Gompertzian exponential model growth fraction tumour ( fraction cell cell cycle ) decrease tumour growth former whereas latter remain constant . Since many chemotherapeutic agent cause cell kill fraction cell cycle , use explain ( partly ) failure chemotherapy large tumour . Since tamoxifen also cause cell cycle arrest ( G1 ) decrease growth fraction , could also impair effect chemotherapy analogous fashion . This result see randomize trial . The fraction cell cycle breast cancer low ( 5 10 % ) determine thymidine label index ( 4 ) . Since chemotherapeutic agent act preferentially exclusively cycle tumor cell , theoretically intuitively appeal increase fraction cycle cell enhance efficacy chemotherapy . One way breast cancer would administer estrogen , know enhance proliferation breast cancer cell . Weichselbaum et al ( 5 ) demonstrate low concentration estradiol ( 10-9 M ) increase fraction cell S-phase enhance rate cell proliferation estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line . The cell kill cell line exposure cytosine arabinoside enhance . Others show even estrogen receptor negative tumor increase cell proliferation response estrogenic stimulus ( 6 ) . This explain partly result modulation kinetic response cancer cell growth factor ( 7,8 ) . There number randomized study literature test concept kinetic recruitment breast cancer cell estrogens increase efficacy chemotherapy ( 9-14 ) . All study use diethylstilbesterol ( DES ) day standard chemotherapy breast cancer recruit cell cycle study patient locally advance ( LABC ) metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . The result study largely negative . In trial Baldine et al ( 14 ) LABC patient difference response rate DES-CAF CAF arm ( 56 % Vs 63 % ) difference overall ( 47 Vs 49 month ) progression free ( 21 Vs 24 month ) survival . DES-CAF find myelotoxic compare CAF alone , result reduce dose intensity former . In trial Conte et al ( 13 ) patient MBC randomize DES-CEF versus CEF alone . Again , difference response rage ( 49 % Vs 57 % ) overall survival ( 20 Vs 17 month ) DES-CEF CEF , former myelotoxic . In trial Ingle et al ( 12 ) MBC patient , response DES-CMF higher ( 39 % Vs 25 % , p=0.06 ) compare CMF alone difference time disease progression survival . In study Paridaens et al ( 11 ) LABC MBC patient , ethinyl-estradiol plus CAF compare CAF . There difference response rate , time progression survival two group . Toxicities also similar . To summarize , result estrogenic recruitment patient LABC MBC negative respect survival study show trend towards high response rate recruitment arm . There two possible explanation negative result . All study metastatic locally advance breast cancer patient . It possible fraction cell inherent chemoresistance high patient compare early stage patient would negate beneficial effect cell recruitment cycle . Secondly , total trial size small ( less 260 ) study therefore grossly underpowered detect meaningful difference two group . As direct corollary negative effect tamoxifen administer concomitantly chemotherapy proven ability estrogens increase proliferate fraction breast cancer cell , hypothesize beneficial effect estrogen prim efficacy standard adjuvant chemotherapy operable breast cancer . Since effect hypothesize micrometastasis , likely chemoresistance lesser impediment . Thus manner inverse tamoxifen , estradiol could ` prime ' tumour subsequent chemotherapy . Since operable breast cancer patient undergone surgery need adjuvant chemotherapy test population , estradiol prim theoretically act micrometastases chemotherapy seeks eradicate .</detailed_description>
