	<brief_title>Post-operative Concurrent Chemo-radiotherapy Versus Post-operative Radiotherapy Cancer Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two every 3 Australians affected skin cancer lifetime . The prevalence skin cancer continue increase due age population represent significant problem community . Cure early ( T1-2 ) de novo cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( CSCC ) treat either curative intent surgery radiotherapy 85-100 % . However , cure rate locally advance , recurrent , metastatic disease regional node follow surgery alone much low , order 20-70 % . Metastatic CSCC common malignancy parotid region Australia . The 5 year loco-regional control surgery alone order 40 % -45 % . The addition post-operative radiotherapy improve loco-regional control 15-20 % , therefore consider standard care group patient . Recent data show synchronous post-operative chemo-radiotherapy superior post-operative radiotherapy alone `` high-risk '' mucosal head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . However , date , evidence randomise trial benefit exists CSCC head neck . At present little consensus amongst clinician Australia receive post-operative chemo-radiotherapy CSCC . Although tumour control rate may improve , addition chemotherapy may also significantly increase treatment related toxicity . Nonetheless , centre adopt use post-operative chemo-radiotherapy select patient CSCC base extrapolation mucosal sit . This result wide variability practice disease . Australia uniquely place perform trial compare post-operative chemo-radiotherapy post-operative radiotherapy alone high-risk CSCC due high rate skin cancer . Currently limit data guide management patient resect CSCC high risk recurrence . While reasonable hypothesize concurrent chemotherapy set confer similar benefit see mucosal HNSCC , establish randomize trial propose . If addition chemotherapy show beneficial safe , result likely translated standard practice nationally internationally quite rapidly . On hand , treatment find ineffective patient spar unnecessary toxicity inconvenience associate addition chemotherapy . A important aspect trial assessment patient-related outcome use validated quality life questionnaire . It important ascertain whether improvement locoregional control due addition chemotherapy , also associate improvement quality life compare control arm .</detailed_description>
