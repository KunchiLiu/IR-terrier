	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed Surgery Versus Concurrent Chemoradiation Carcinoma Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer uterine cervix major health problem develop country include India commonest cancer amongst woman India nearly 1,00000 new woman diagnose cancer every year . It also main cause cancer relate mortality among woman India . At Tata Memorial Hospital , approximately 1600 new patient cervical cancer register every year , nearly 70 % present locally advanced stage . A majority patient diagnose stage IB cervical cancer India bulky tumour ( 4 cm size ) classify stage IB2 per new FIGO staging ( 1 ) . These tumour associate high incidence pelvic lymph node metastasis . Finan et al ( 2 ) note positive pelvic node 15.5 % patient stage Ib1 disease versus 43.8 % stage Ib2 . Positive paraaortic node present 1.8 % patient stage Ib1 disease versus 6.3 % patient stage Ib2 . The result radical surgery radical radiation therapy alone combination tumour report much inferior stage IB1 tumours ( 60-65 % vs. 85-90 % five year survival ) . The incidence pelvic lymph node metastasis result treatment stage IB2 tumours less similar stage IIB tumour . The ability radiotherapy surgery cure locally advanced cervical cancer limit size tumour , high incidence pelvic lymph node metastases potential systemic spread . Besides , dose require treat large tumour exceed limit toxicity normal tissue . Efforts overcome problem include use different chemotherapy drug different schedule . Chemotherapy use management locally advance cervical cancer along radiation therapy surgery different way e.g . neoadjuvant , adjuvant concurrent . The standard approach use chemotherapy treatment patient locally advanced disease use concurrent chemoradiation . The concurrent use single drug multiple drug regimen radiotherapy test woman cervical cancer . Recent data prospective randomise trial two meta-analyses ( 3-12 ) unequivocally show significant survival advantage ( disease free overall survival ) use concurrent chemoradiation use platinum base chemotherapy compare radical radiation alone patient locally advanced cervical cancer ( stag IB2-IIIB ) . A significant reduction distant metastasis also note concurrent chemoradiation therapy arm . This lead acceptance concurrent chemoradiation therapy new standard care locally advanced cervical cancer . The meta-analyses trial show beneficial effect survival evident stage IB2 stage II B tumour compare stage III B tumour ( constituted 35 % total number patient ) . An alternative approach use chemotherapy prior local therapy , could surgery radiation . Some theoretical benefit neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( hereinafter abbreviate NACT ) like eradication micrometastases long advance never prove . It certainly help reduction tumour bulk patient locally advanced disease . Some latter patient able undergo surgery otherwise possible . The downside NACT delay institution definitive treatment 20 30 % patient n't respond chemotherapy . The randomized trial NACT follow radiation therapy versus radiation therapy alone show improvement survival ( 13-19 ) . It possible failure show survival benefit NACT follow radiation due selection chemoresistant clone also radioresistant . A second explanation ( also advance failure NACT approach head neck cancer ) NACT select patient ( one respond ) biologically favourable disease confers benefit . Surgical removal tumour chemotherapy however interaction biochemical resistance remain clone . It therefore potential providing benefit additive chemotherapy radiotherapy . In paper Sardi et al ( 20 , 21 ) report randomized trial NACT ( bleomycin , vincristine cisplatin ) follow surgery plus radiation versus either surgery plus radiation radiation control arm patient stage 1B , 2B 3B cervical cancer . There high response rate NACT stage 1B patient ( 90 % 1B1 83.6 % 1B2 ) . The overall survival whole group stage 1B patient superior NACT arm ( n=102 ) compare control arm ( n=103 ) ( 81 % Vs 66 % , p = 0.025 ) . The resectability rate among stage 1B2 patient give NACT 100 % ( n = 61 ) compare 85 % control ( n = 56 ) . In stage 2B resectability rate NACT arm 80 % ( n = 76 ) compare 56 % control arm ( n = 75 ) . However clear survival advantage NACT arm control stag 2B 3B . Although trial report survival advantage NACT follow surgery subgroup patient result definitive . The treatment offer control arm trial ( attempt surgical removal upfront stag 1B 2B radiation stage 2B 3B ) standard current standard number various group small . In order consider therapeutic option locally advanced patient , NACT follow surgery must compare current therapeutic standard , concurrent chemoradiation . The chemotherapeutic option cervical cancer present different one use Sardi et al . The combination ifosfamide cisplatin paclitaxel carboplatin likely show high response rate compare regimen use Sardi et al , bleomycin , vincristine cisplatin . Considering result literature , appear logical compare neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow surgery concurrent chemoradiation patient stage IB2 IIB squamous carcinoma cervix .</detailed_description>
