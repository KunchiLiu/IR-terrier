	<brief_summary>Traditionally metastatic breast cancer patient offer loco-regional treatment except case fungation bleeding . However , scientific evidence omission loco-regional treatment metastatic breast cancer patient lack . On one hand , study show removal primary tumor time lead complete disappearance metastasis improvement survival renal cell carcinoma patient . However , study never perform solid tumor . On hand , strong body evidence experimental setting show removal primary tumor allow growth metastasis . There lack similar data human clinical setting . Offering loco-regional treatment metastatic breast cancer patient set randomize control trial help improve survival patient understanding natural history breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Impact Loco-regional Treatment Survival Metastatic Breast Cancer Presentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRESENT KNOWLEDGE : Loco-regional treatment attempt metastatic breast cancer patient traditional teaching , lack scientific basis . Omission loco-regional treatment part standard care scientific evidence inadequate . Today treatment offer fungation and/or bleeding . Studies metastatic renal cell carcinoma show removal primary tumor cause disappearance metastasis [ 1 ] improve survival [ 2,3 ] . The exact mechanism phenomenon understood . Although immunologic mechanism suggest , remain largely unproven . [ 1 ] On contrary , metastases autonomy hypothesis animal model suggest removal primary tumor render autonomy metastasis , start grow rapidly . [ 4 ] The suggested mechanism anti-angiogenic/ angiostatic activity primary tumor . However , study never perform human subject . Which hypothesis true ? What removal primary tumor cause - suppression stimulation growth metastasis ? Whether suppression stimulation affect survival ? These question , need answer improve understanding natural history breast cancer . vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) [ 5 ] , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) [ 6 ] angiogenic proliferative factor stimulate tumor/ metastasis growth . Angiostatin [ 7 ] Endostatin [ 8 ] inhibitor angiogenesis . It balance angiogenic factor anti-angiogenic factor determine tumor/metastases growth [ 7 ] . Lot ongoing research [ 9 ] focus administration Angiostatin Endostatin tilt balance favor anti-angiogenesis . Does removal primary tumor change balance ? And impact change balance ( ) survival ? These question answer in-vivo study human . Demonstration effect absence effect help u refine therapeutic target metastatic patient . There dearth reliable data change level angiogenic , proliferative growth factor anti-angiogenic factor relation time removal primary . Removal primary tumor result growth metastasis animal experiment five day [ 4 ] metastasis triple size thirteenth day . Hence , decide measure level factor end one week follow surgery end three month . This study aim : Firstly , assess impact loco-regional treatment survival metastatic breast cancer patient . Secondly , understand mechanism suppression/ stimulation growth metastases measurement angiogenic , proliferative growth factor anti-angiogenic factor intervention . TRIAL DESIGN : Patients metastatic breast cancer diagnose incision biopsy stag investigation undergo six cycle anthracycline-based chemotherapy . At end chemotherapy , patient randomize two group . First group receive standard loco-regional treatment i.e . surgery ( modified radical mastectomy ( MRM ) / Simple Mastectomy Axillary Clearance ( SMAC ) / Breast Conservation Therapy ( BCT ) +/- radiotherapy ( depend type surgery perform histopathology report ) . Second group receive loco-regional treatment . INVESTIGATIONS : A . Diagnostic : Incision biopsy primary diagnosis estrogen receptor ( ER ) / progesterone receptor ( PgR ) status . B . Staging : - Liver function test - Chest X-ray &amp; USG - Abdomen &amp; pelvis &amp; / CECT chest Upper Abdomen - Bone scan relevant x-ray skeletal survey ( MRI doubtful case ) ELIGIBILITY : Inclusion criterion : 1 . Metastatic breast cancer patient expect survival least one year 2 . Age 21-65 year Exclusion criterion : 1 . Patients fit receive anthracycline base chemotherapy . 2 . More two visceral organ involvement . 3 . Multiple liver metastasis derange liver function test serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) / serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) four time upper normal limit ) . 4 . Locally static progressive disease systemically progressive disease show repeat stag investigation guide worsen symptom . 5 . Ulceration/ fungation/ bleed completion chemotherapy , mandate surgery . 6 . Expected survival less six month completion chemotherapy . 7 . Unfit anesthesia due metastatic disease . CONSENT AND RANDOMIZATION : Computerized randomization carry central office confirmation eligibility obtain inform write consent . Randomization stratify 1 . Visceral bone and/ soft tissue metastasis . 2 . Less equal 3 , three metastasis . 3 . Hormone responsive non-responsive tumor . TRIAL SIZE AND ACCRUAL : Breast cancer patient metastatic disease presentation median survival eighteen month . Detection six-month improvement survival 95 % confidence 80 % power two tail analysis require minimum 350 patient . METHODOLOGY : 1 . All eligible patient provisionally mark trial . 2 . Number sit metastasis document along size . 3 . Patients receive maximum six cycle Cyclophosphamide ( 600 mg/m2 ) , Adriamycin ( 60 mg/m2 ) , 5- Fluoro-Uracil ( 600 mg/m2 ) . 4 . Patients reassessed end chemotherapy ( approximately five month later ) . Staging investigation viz . CECT thorax upper abdomen ( case visceral metastasis ) relevant X-rays repeat . All eligible patient randomize two group ( stratified randomization ) . First group undergo standard loco-regional treatment ( surgery follow radiotherapy depend histopathology report type surgery perform e.g . BCT ) surgical oophorectomy ( time surgery ) follow hormone therapy ( ER and/ PgR positive pre-menopausal patient ) . Postmenopausal patient receive hormone therapy . Second group start hormone therapy ( ER and/ PgR positive and/ postmenopausal patient ) . Hormone therapy form Aromatase inhibitor ( Letrozole 2.5mg OD/ Anastrozole 1.0mg OD ) 5 . All patient loco-regional treatment group two three blood sample ( 10-cc blood plain bulb ) collect . These sample use estimation VEGF , bFGF , Angiostatin Endostatin ELISA . Sample 1 : A day prior surgery . Sample 2 : Seventh post operative day . Sample 3 : Three month surgery . 6 . The metastasis reassess twelve week surgery change size number repeat stag investigation viz . CECT thorax upper abdomen ( case visceral metastasis ) relevant X-rays symptomatic progression . Patients symptomatic bony metastasis addition receive local radiotherapy ( wherever indicate ) and/ bisphosphonates ( wherever indicate ) . Patients arm undergo metastasectomy wherever indicate . PATHOLOGY : Pathological tumor size , number axillary lymph node dissect number positive metastasis , histological type primary tumour ( infiltrate duct carcinoma standard grade , infiltrate lobular carcinoma , rare histology [ medullary , papillary , colloid etc . ] ) , presence absence lymphatic , vascular peri-neural invasion note patient . Estimation biological marker ER , PgR mandatory . Entries make case report form ( CRFs ) . END POINT : Primary : 1 . Overall survival ( time death ) 2 . Progression free survival Secondary : Changes VEGF , bFGF , Angiostatin Endostatin . DATA COLLECTION , QUALITY CONTROL AND ANALYSIS : Data collection carry individual clinician prescribe form : Pre-randomization form , primary data sheet , pathology information . At least 20 % data cross-checked internal/external review . The trial centre data manager help individual clinician maintain completeness data latter responsible correctness information . All form maintain duplicate central trial office . Data monitoring committee periodically review trial . Univariate comparison randomization arm carry use chi-squared test .</detailed_description>
