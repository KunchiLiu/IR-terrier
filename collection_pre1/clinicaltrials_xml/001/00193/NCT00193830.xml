	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy still remain mainstay treatment patient carcinoma cervix advanced stage . Conventional treatment radiation therapy include combination external beam radiation therapy intracavitary treatment . Low dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy treatment time-tested modality brachytherapy sound radiobiological base . But high dose rate brachytherapy relatively new alternative . In low dose rate brachytherapy staff receive radiation high dose rate brachytherapy procedure complete protection staff achieve treatment do remote afterloading technique . The high dose rate brachytherapy possible Out Patient Department procedure . Few clinical trial prove feasibility efficacy high dose rate brachytherapy carcinoma cervix . However , concrete evidence especially develop country change practice HDR brachytherapy . Hence , Tata Memorial Hospital aim ass efficacy , feasibility , early late complication high dose rate brachytherapy contrast low dose rate brachytherapy propose study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Carcinoma cervix common malignancy Indian woman constitute approximately 27 % cancer record annual report Hospital base cancer registry 1991 . Carcinoma cervix form one leading cause death disability due cancer India . Nearly 80 % patient carcinoma cervix present advance stage . Despite advance conventional modality five-year survival 26 % 43 % stage IIIB stage IIB respectively . In develop country socio-economic problem , illiteracy , late presentation irregular follow-up result early locoregional distant failure compound problem . Radiation therapy still remain important modality treatment patient carcinoma cervix advanced stage . Conventional treatment radiation therapy include combination external beam radiation therapy intracavitary treatment . Low dose rate intracavitary treatment time-tested modality brachytherapy carcinoma cervix sound radiobiological base . But high dose rate brachytherapy relatively new method . In low dose rate brachytherapy staff receive radiation high dose rate brachytherapy procedure complete protection staff achieve treatment do remote afterloading technique . The high dose rate brachytherapy possible OPD procedure . Various clinical trial prove feasibility efficacy high dose rate brachytherapy carcinoma cervix . At Tata Memorial Hospital advocate study ass efficacy , feasibility , early late complication high dose rate brachytherapy contrast low dose rate brachytherapy .</detailed_description>
