	<brief_summary>The study compare 2 different method combine chemotherapy radiotherapy treatment localise lung cancer patient suitable surgery . Hypothesis ( e ) test : 1 . Vinorelbine + cisplatin + high-dose palliative radiotherapy superior gemcitabine + high dose palliative radiotherapy term efficacy multi-institutional setting 2 . Vinorelbine + cisplatin + high-dose palliative radiotherapy superior gemcitabine + high dose palliative radiotherapy term feasibility multi-institutional setting 3 . Vinorelbine + cisplatin + high-dose palliative radiotherapy favourable toxicity profile relative gemcitabine + high-dose palliative radiotherapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A third patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) present Stage IIIA IIIB disease , amenable curative resection . Single modality local therapy , either surgery radiation , cure fraction patient . Radical radiation feasible patient unresectable Stage IIIA IIIB non-small cell lung cancer , base upon extent loco-regional disease medical state patient . Patients good performance status receive protract high-dose palliative radiotherapy obtain survival benefit therapy . Studies show survival advantage add chemotherapy radical radiation therapy : study high-dose palliative radiotherapy set lack . Two regimen concurrent chemotherapy high-dose palliative radiotherapy develop locally , establish MTDs . These 2 regimen warrant comparative assessment phase II trial , prior phase III trial high dose palliative radiation alone ( 36Gy/12 # /5 ) . This randomised phase II trial comprise 2 arm randomization follow : Arm A : External beam radiation , 40 Gy/20 # /5 per week , Plus concurrent Vinorelbine , IV , 25mg/m2 , day 1 , 8 , 22 + Cisplatin 20mg/m2 , IV , weekly Arm B : External beam radiation , 30 Gy/15 # /5 per week , Plus concurrentGemcitabine , 200mg ( flat dose ) IV day 1 , 8 , 15 An equal number patient randomise arm . The randomisation carry Princess Alexandra Trial Centre . Patients assessed baseline , weekly treatment , 3 week , 6 week 12 week post treatment 3 monthly thereafter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically proven nonsmall cell lung cancer . Planned high dose palliative radiation therapy locoregional control . Examples include patient : 1 . Stage I IIIB disease disease technically unsuitable radical therapy , Â· weight loss excess 10 % , concurrent medical illness 2 . Patients find locally advanced thoracic disease suitable radical therapy work find FDGPET solitary metastasis . All potential patient , prior registration , must review multidisciplinary lung oncology meeting attend medical oncologist , radiation oncologist radiologist . No prior radiotherapy chemotherapy nonsmall cell lung cancer . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 . Adequate hepatic , bone marrow renal function . If patient female child bear potential , must pregnant lactating . Males female reproductive potential must practise adequate contraception . Written informed consent . Patient unable receive therapy outpatient . Significant medical condition opinion investigator would compromise plan delivery chemotherapy radiotherapy may potentially exacerbated modality . History cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix ) unless complete remission therapy cancer least 5 year . Receiving treatment another investigational agent .</criteria>
