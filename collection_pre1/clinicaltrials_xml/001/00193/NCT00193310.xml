	<brief_summary>In phase II study , plan evaluate several novel component therapy . In patient potentially resectable stage IIB ( T3N0 ) IIIA compare weekly paclitaxel carboplatin concomitant radiation therapy versus weekly paclitaxel every 4 week carboplatin preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) setting . For patient potentially resectable stage IB , IIA IIB ( T2N1 ) tumor , weekly paclitaxel every 4 week carboplatin give pre-operatively ( neoadjuvant ) . The feasibility resection evaluate neoadjuvant group patient . The continued study concurrent radiation therapy weekly paclitaxel carboplatin evaluate patient stage IIB ( T3N0 ) IIIA disease initially resection ( adjuvant setting ) . Lastly , weekly paclitaxel carboplatin every 4 week evaluate adjuvant program patient completely resect stage IB , IIA IIB ( T2N1 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upon determination eligibility , neo-adjuvant patient randomly assign one two treatment arm : - ARM A Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Radiation Therapy + Surgery - ARM B Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Surgery After surgery neo-adjuvant patient complete resection either receive Paclitaxel + Carboplatin therapy , depend stage disease time enrollment . Patients incomplete resection Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Radiation Therapy . Adjuvant patient enter study complete resection receive Paclitaxel + Carboplatin without Radiation Therapy base initial stage disease .</detailed_description>
