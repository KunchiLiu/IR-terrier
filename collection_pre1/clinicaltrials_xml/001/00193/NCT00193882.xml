	<brief_summary>To compare treatment gullet cancer radiotherapy alone assess advantage toxicity add chemotherapy . The hypothesis test follow : That addition chemotherapy short course radiation treatment improve proportion patient achieve relief dysphagia improve quality life compare radiation alone patient advanced oesophageal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced Oesophageal Cancer Study Compare Quality Life Palliation Dysphagia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective radical treatment trial oesophageal cancer show response radiotherapy alone radiotherapy combined chemotherapy . Retrospective study show response palliative setting relieve dysphagia . The response , durability quality life end point previously fully document . This addressed trial . Dysphagia common present symptom due local disease obstruct oesophagus . Difficulty eat affect patient 's ability maintain nutrition , also impact area quality life . Relief dysphagia becomes high priority treatment . At time develop protocol randomise trial compare chemo-radiotherapy radiotherapy palliative setting . Few study prospectively assess quality life data patient oesophageal cancer , although toxicity survival data available , long-term data quality life . This trial ass quality life consecutive manner use standardise self-reporting measure quality life , compare quality life across two group different treatment . Eligible patient proven carcinoma oesophagus deem suitable definitive radical treatment due advanced nature disease , presence metastasis intercurrent illness , symptomatic dysphagia require loco-regional palliation . Patients randomise follow treatment option : 1 . Radiotherapy Alone - 35 Gy 15 fraction ( Australia New Zealand ) - 30 Gy 10 fraction ( Canada ONLY ) 2 . Chemo-Radiotherapy - 35 Gy 15 fraction ( Australia New Zealand ) - 30 Gy 10 fraction ( Canada ONLY ) - Cisplatin 80mg/m2 IV day 1 ( 20mg/m2/day IV day 1 - 4 ) - 5-Fluorouracil 800mg/m2/day IV day 1 - 4 Patients initial baseline assessment follow weekly treatment , monthly 1 year post treatment 3 monthly .</detailed_description>
