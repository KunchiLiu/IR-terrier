	<brief_summary>18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography ( FDG-PET ) Imaging extensively use evaluation various malignancy rapidly recognize mandatory investigation . 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography ( FDG-PET ) Imaging also try cervical cancer excellent result detection pelvic extra-pelvic disease term sensitivity specificity . Till date , PET Imaging report high sensitivity specificity detection disease treatment failure compare non-invasive investigation available . Treatment decision ( Localized RT Vs Extended RT ) accord result PET Scans . The treatment response , outcome follow-up label accord PET Scan result direct treatment accordingly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : Carcinoma Cervix common malignancy lead cause cancer mortality see Indian woman . At Tata Memorial Hospital , Carcinoma Cervix constitute approximately 10 % cancer ( 1 ) . Nearly 85 % patient present advanced stage ( FIGO Stage II/III ) . The main stay treatment traditionally radical radiation therapy 80-90 % patient require radiation lifetime decade survival rate achieve plateau 30 - 55 % 5 year . In patient advanced stage ( stage IIB IVA ) , 15 - 38 % para-aortic lymph nodal metastasis ( 2 ) . Identification para-aortic nodal status allow modification radiation therapy field include nodal disease , , intestinal morbidity , routinely include treatment field Radiation Oncologists . Extended field radiation therapy include para-aortic node associate 31 % 50 % 5 year-survival , depend location extent para-aortic nodal metastasis likelihood control pelvic disease ( 3-5 ) Therefore , advance cervical cancer , report progression-free survival significantly relate para-aortic lymph node metastasis ( 6-8 ) . In collective series Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols , Para aortic nodal status significant indication recurrence ( 6 ) . A number noninvasive modality use evaluate status para-aortic nodal metastasis . The introduction Computed Tomographic ( CT ) Scanning mid-1970s provide method para-aortic nodal disease evaluation ( 9 ) . CT Scanning widely use clinical staging , sensitivity nodal metastasis 44 % ( 10 ) . In contrast CT , primarily rely morphologic criterion , FDG-PET non-invasively assess metabolic activity cancer metastatic lesion . The differentiation capability malignant lesion FDG-PET compromise use morphologic size criterion . Even malignant lesion less 1 cm diameter manifest high FDG uptake differentiate nonmalignant tissue use PET . Therefore , FDG-PET detect metastatic para-aortic lymph node patient advanced cervical cancer whose lymph nod abnormally enlarge . Many publish data previously report clinical value 18F FDG PET image primary tumor , stag nodal visceral involvement , also detect recurrent disease ( 11-19 ) . Rose et al . ( 11 ) use FDG-PET evaluate nodal metastasis locally advanced cervical cancer surgical staging , sensitivity 75 % specificity 92 % detect metastases para-aortic lymph node . They find accuracy FDG-PET great CT detect para-aortic lymph nodal metastasis . In similar series , Wu et al . report sensitivity 85.7 % , specificity 94.4 % , accuracy 92 % FDG PET detect para-aortic lymph nodal metastasis patient advanced cervical cancer negative abdominal CT finding . Grigsby et al . ( 12 ) demonstrate FDG-PET detects abnormal lymph node region CT , FDG-PET finding well predictor survival CT patient cervical cancer . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) also review evaluate primary disease cervix also para-aortic nodal staging . MRI recognize important imaging modality management cervical cancer multiplanar capability , distinct tissue contrast characteristic use various pulse sequence , excellent tissue contrast , particularly tumor surround normal tissue . However , PET finding often compare CT result , MRI nowadays consider modality choice stag primary tumor ( 20,21 ) . Only one study Narayan et al . compare respective value MRI PET stag loco-regionally advanced cervical cancer ( 22 ) . Their study find primary tumor similarly detect two image technique sensitivity 100 % . On hand , except small-volume metastasis , PET sufficiently high positive predictive value ( 91 % ) pelvis para-aortic region , obviate lymph node sample . More recent study show 3D quantitative imaging-based method tumor size assessment use MRI highly accurate determine actual tumor size extent ( 23-27 ) may superior clinical palpation predict local tumor control ( 23,25,28 ) Conversely , MRI accuracy insufficient nodal management . If MRI remain modality choice evaluate loco-regional status primary tumor , metabolic image i.e FDG PET seem particularly useful staging , one session , extra pelvic nodal metastasis . Thus , PET may significant impact treatment decision-making . Identification para-aortic nodal status allow modification radiation therapy field include nodal disease . Stehman et al . previously demonstrate prognostic importance para-aortic nodal status locally advance cervical carcinoma ( 6 ) . In advanced cervical cancer , report progression-free survival significantly relate para-aortic lymph node metastasis ( 6-8 ) . Recent study show survival benefit patient positive para-aortic node treat extended-field irradiation concurrent radio-sensitizing chemotherapy ( 29-31 ) . PET also great value optimally confirm complete remission detect recurrence non-invasively post-treatment follow-up . More recently , positron emission tomography ( PET ) glucose analogue , 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) demonstrate promising result evaluate tumor response predict survival primary treatment radiation therapy chemotherapy several tumor type , include head-and-neck cancer , breast cancer , seminoma , colorectal cancer , lymphoma , lung cancer ( 33-40 ) . Recently , Grigsby et al report role FDG PET posttherapy surveillance monitoring series 75 patient cervical cancer . They conclude FDG-PET valuable tool evaluate response primary lymph node disease radiation therapy chemotherapy Post-Rx surveillance patient detect asymptomatic recurrence ( 41 ) .</detailed_description>
