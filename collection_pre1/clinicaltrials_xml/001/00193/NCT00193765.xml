	<detailed_description>ELECTIVE VERSUS THERAPEUTIC NECK DISSECTION IN THE TREATMENT OF EARLY NODE NEGATIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF THE ORAL CAVITY INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION : Cervical metastasis single important prognostic factor head neck cancer . Appropriate management neck therefore paramount importance treatment cancer . Should neck electively treated wait watch policy ? Current practice neck always address whenever increase propensity cervical metastasis patient follow-up unreliable . This usually case large T stag cancer ( T3/T4 ) also neck enter time surgery primary . Situation however different regard early cancer oral cavity ( T1/T2 ) . These cancer usually treat surgery excision per-oral route . Elective neck dissection situation additional surgical procedure associate cost , prolonged hospitalization , morbidity may unnecessary high 80 % patient finally turn pathologically node negative . There considerable debate whether treat neck electively world definite evidence support either policy wait watch elective neck treatment . Proponents elective neck treatment cite fact patient whose neck observe , nodal recurrence detect advanced stage detrimental ultimate outcome patient . Major draw back trial apart retrospective nature fact total number patient majority small ( none 150 , majority le 100 ) different time span draw meaningful conclusion . It would therefore attractive prove point conclusively prospective randomize trial . To date three prospective trial conduct address issue , two inconclusive one show benefit towards elective neck dissection . First widely cite study Institute Gustave- Roussy 75 patient oral cavity cancer either elective salvage RND.In study , group patient similar survival rate . Fakih et.al . , report similar finding study institution 100 patient randomize two group , elective neck dissection versus wait watch . Only 70 evaluable . Disease free survival ( median follow-up 20 month ) 52 % versus 63 % patient underwent hemiglossectomy alone underwent hemiglossectomy radical neck dissection , respectively . This difference though slightly favor elective neck dissection statistically significant . Finally prospective trial conduct Kligerman co-worker Brazil randomize 67 patient T1-2 N0 SCC floor mouth oral tongue receive resection primary alone resection elective neck dissection . Occult disease see 21 % received END recurrence see 24 % patient group . By comparison recurrence rate 42 % resection group . This translated 3.5-year disease free survival group 49 % resection arm versus 72 % arm receive END ( 7 ) . It obvious major shortcoming three study retrospective study relatively small number patient recruit trial ( 75 , 100 &amp; 63 ) . Thus clearly need large randomize trial resolve issue either way . Origin trial West difficult due relative lack cancer part world . At Tata hospital conservative estimate 100-150 patient would eligible enrollment year trial . Moreover trial design treatment arm simple ideal multicentre trial India standardization uniformity would easily achievable across participate center . Presently global consensus management early T1/T2 cancer clinically negative neck . As consequence current practice world include : 1 . Elective neck dissection stag procedure . Clinical assessment lesion respect size depth infiltration . 2 . Assessment neck ultrasound ultrasound guide FNAC CT / MRI . 3 . Wait watch policy ( belief neck dissection unnecessary 80 % patient ) 4 . Interval neck dissection 5 . Sentinel node biopsy . trial propose help answer question except last . AIMS OF STUDY Primary Objective : To demonstrate whether elective neck dissection ( END ) equal superior wait watch policy i.e.therapeutic neck dissection ( TND ) management clinically No neck early T1 /T2 cancer oral cavity . Secondary Objective : 1 . Does Ultrasound examination role routine initial workup node negative patient ? 2 . How patient ideally follow -does sonography role clinical examination sufficient . 3 . Is assessment tumor thickness surgeon time initial surgery accurate -Is correlation 4 . Identify histological prognostic factor primary may help identify sub-set patient increase risk cervical metastasis . Stratification criterion : 1 . Size 2 . Sex 3 . Site 4 . Sonography Ethical Concerns : 1 . Should patient ultrasonography finding suggestive metastasis remove randomization - Ultrasonography simple often use method detect neck metastasis . Sensitivity range 50-75 % . These figure much high center routinely practice sonography detect neck metastasis center Europe . However accept standard care world include USA India initial management patient node negative neck . Moreover accurate ultrasound neck extremely operator dependent whether routine use recommend particularly country may difficult . - Specificity ultrasonography clinically node negative neck 50-70 % . This increased addition fine needle aspiration cytology enlarge node . Doing procedure routinely patient difficult next impossible give expertise require sonologist well pathologist particularly country . - Costs- Even though ultrasound relatively inexpensive significant cost wait period involve give number patient oral cancer country . - There evidence literature sono detection occult metastasis immediate surgery translate well control survival . - Interval neck dissection perform Vandenbrooks prospective series primary treat radiotherapy patient randomize either neck dissection wait watch six week later . Protocol amendment detail : Protocol amendment accept Scientific ethic committee/Instititional Review board 29/12/2008 follow : All patient undergo pre randomization ultrasonography neck . If USG report suggest metastasis patient would treat accord merit avoid ethical concern USG report normal indeterminate , patient would randomize trial . This protocol amendment do view follow 2 reason . Very often patient uncomfortable give consent explain initial ultrasonography report blind finding consider decide patient 's treatment plan . This result low recruitment patient also raise ethical issue blind adequately maintain especially sonography suggested metastasis . To overcome difference opinion amongst examine clinician clinically significant node . However , break blind would bear outcome / impact study . Randomization ( I ) : All patient randomly allocate one two arm : wait watch policy group elective neck dissection group . Both arm similar wide excision primary tumor oral cavity per oral route . Randomization ( II ) : Following surgery complete recovery prior discharge , patient randomize second time follow-up two arm namely clinical examination versus clinical examination ultrasonography neck . SURGICAL PROCEDURE : Primary : tumor excise proper exposure via per-oral route . - Emphasis achieve wide clearance tumor free margin obviate need subsequent radiotherapy primary , would otherwise act confound factor . Neck : Patients randomize neck dissection undergo standard supra-omohyoid neck dissection involve clearance nodal Levels I , II , III.Completion MND do require . Patients develop metastatic adenopathy follow-up undergo modify neck dissection/radical neck dissection depend size metastatic disease . Those node suggestive metastasis follow-up sonography , undergo supraomohyoid dissection , frozen section follow modified neck dissection positive . Depth tumor infiltration though probably important individual prognostic factor decide likelihood cervical metastasis , unfortunately available clinician final histopathology report . Had parameter present time surgery patient increase likelihood metastasis could undergo elective neck dissection low incidence could save unnecessary operation .This study would help find accuracy correlation gross assessment thickness surgeon , frozen section final thickness histopathology would importance country like oral cancer common facility freeze well expertise measure accurately tumor thickness histopathology may unavailable . POST OPERATIVE RADIOTHERAPY : Standard accept criterion follow . Patients receive post operative radiotherapy primary include main analysis analyze separately ( Escape clause ) . END POINT OF STUDY : The primary end point overall survival secondary end point DFS . The patient follow death study close whichever earlier . Since overall survival primary endpoint , patient follow death . telephonic mail contact acceptable . Local failure , distant metastasis second primary document . DATA COLLECTION , QUALITY CONTROL &amp; ANALYSIS : All data collect keep Trial Office Clinical Research Secretariat . Data collect separate protocol sheet ( clinical , radiological , pathological ) keep trial office along source document . Trial coordinator responsible upkeep data . Assuming baseline overall survival 60 % , expect improvement treatment arm 10 % . patient require 710 ( 355 arm ) α=0.05 ( one side ) &amp; power 80 % ( β=20 ) . An interim analysis plan 250 event ( death ) occur . Ultrasound routine follow-up patient labor intensive . However median follow-up recurrence study retrospective/prospective 9 month average ( range 6 months- 13months ) . It therefore important follow patient every vigilantly first 12 month primary treatment . Follow-up schedule : First visit : 4 week ; First 6 month : 4-6 week ; 6-12 month : 6-8 week ; 12 months- 2 year : 8-12 weekly ; Thereafter : 3 monthly . Patients encourage counseled come check earlier date within range allow . All patient follow one investigator entry make source document well central registration cell CRS study coordinator . At examination patient undergo head neck examination well ultrasound randomize arm .</detailed_description>
