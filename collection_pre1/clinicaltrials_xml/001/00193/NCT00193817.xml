	<brief_summary>Surgery standard treatment esophageal ( food pipe ) cancer . Esophageal cancer know spread lymph node ( gland ) adjacent esophagus . The extent lymph node need remove along removal esophagus controversial topic . The basic surgery remain i.e. , foodpipe chest remove new substitute create stomach join foodpipe neck . This involve incision chest , abdomen neck . We intend compare two type lymphadenectomy ( removal lymph node ) - two field lymphadenectomy , whereby lymph node abdomen low half chest remove three field lymphadenectomy , wherein lymph node abdomen , whole chest lower neck remove . Both procedure practise widely worldwide definite scientific evidence show superiority either . We conduct study see whether one procedure superior . Seven hundred patient expect participate study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three Field Radical Esophagectomy Versus Two Field Esophagectomy - Prospective Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three field radical esophagectomy versus two field esophagectomy – prospective randomize control trial Background Esophageal cancer common problem worldwide associate poor prognosis . Surgery mainstay treatment offer realistic possibility cure long term survival . Neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy try addition surgery marginally impact survival . In spite advancement postoperative care refinement surgical technique , overall result surgery disappointing . Moreover study neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy confound lack uniform surgical approach extent lymphadenectomy . The efficacy prophylactic radical lymph node dissection surgical treatment esophageal cancer topic major controversy many year . It study randomize controlled trial adequate number . Non randomize study criticize basis selection bias stage migration . There presently convince evidence regard improvement survival extensive three field lymphadenectomy . Objectives 1 . To compare overall survival three field two field esophagectomy 2 . To compare locoregional recurrence , disease free survival three field two field esophagectomy 3 . To compare postoperative morbidity mortality two group 4 . To evaluate short long term quality life two procedure Design Prospective randomize control trial Setting Tertiary level comprehensive cancer care centre Western India . Patients method All patient biopsy proven carcinoma esophagus present hospital consider study . Inclusion criteria 1 . Patients biopsy cytology proven ( squamous adenocarcinoma ) esophageal cancer ( include Siewert ’ type I II CO junction cancer ) 2 . Patients stag investigation indicate operability 3 . Surgical plan total transthoracic esophagectomy Exclusion criterion 1 . Patients low performance status ( ECOG score &gt; 1 ) 2 . Past history malignancy 3 . Staging investigation indicate advanced disease 4 . Patients medically unfit surgical resection 5 . Patients pulmonary reserve inadequate undergo thoracotomy extensive mediastinal dissection 6 . Patients consider salvage surgery definitive chemoradiotherapy 7 . Patients unreliable follow 8 . Patients age 70 year 9 . Patients enlarge supracarinal node CT scan / EUS 10 . Grossly enlarge supracarinal lymph node see intraoperatively 11 . Patients Siewert ’ type III cancer . A detailed history include main complaint symptom , symptom suggestive advanced disease dissemination , comorbid condition performance status patient record presentation . A confirmed diagnosis esophageal carcinoma document hospital . Staging investigation standard include 1 . Computed Tomography ( CT ) scan patient 2 . Endoscopic Ultrasonography ( EUS ) wherever possible 3 . Fiberoptic bronchoscopy ( upper middle third growths patient history recent voice change ) . 4 . Symptomatic patient undergo investigation depend symptom . Patients undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy chemoradiotherapy exclude one stratification criterion randomization . Patients assessed operability team include two qualified thoracic surgeon radiologist . All patient undergo routine special investigation indicate assess fitness major surgery anesthesia . The perioperative risk assess combination American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) grade modify risk score ( Annexure 1 ) . Patients ASA grade I II low intermediate risk accord modify risk score system consider trial . Patients explain trial write informed consent take ( Annexure 2 ) . Patients consider operable ( either per primum neoadjuvant therapy ) fit either procedure consent trial ( Eligibility confirmation randomization form , annexure 3 ) randomize two group . Randomization Block randomization do use computer generate sheet . Randomization perform intraoperatively confirm resectability primary tumor confirm absence grossly enlarge supracarinal lymph node Stratification criterion 1 . Preoperative T stage ( T1 &amp; 2 , T3 T4 ) 2 . Preoperative N stage ( N0 , N1 ) 3 . Level disease ( upper , middle low third ) 4 . Neoadjuvant therapy ( none , chemotherapy , chemoradiotherapy ) 5 . Histology ( squamous adenocarcinoma ) . All patient consider trial proforma fill pre , intra postoperative detail ( Annexure 4 ) . Preoperative patient preparation would routine identical group include chest physiotherapy , deep breathing exercise incentive spirometry . Bronchodilators antibiotic use selectively indicate . Trial schema Patients esophageal cancer Staging investigation ( CT scan , EUS , FOB ) indicate operable disease surgical plan total transthoracic esophagectomy Investigations fitness surgery indicate good risk surgery STRATIFY 1 . Preoperative T stage ( T1 &amp; 2 , T3 T4 ) 2 . Preoperative N stage ( N0 , N1 ) 3 . Level disease ( upper , middle low third ) 4 . Neoadjuvant therapy ( none , chemotherapy , chemoradiotherapy ) 5 . Histology ( squamous adenocarcinoma ) RANDOMIZE Three field esophagectomy Two field esophagectomy All surgery perform general anesthesia epidural analgesia . The surgery either perform direct supervision consultant thoracic surgeon experience esophageal surgery . Thoracic esophageal mobilization mediastinal lymphadenectomy do open thoracotomy video assist thoracoscopic surgery . Lymphadenectomy define consensus conference fifth IGSC Munich . Field 1 . The abdominal field include lymphatic connective tissue hiatus cranially , upper border pancreas caudally , splenic hilum leave hepatoduodenal ligament right gastric artery right . Field II . This refer intrathoracic compartment define 1 . Standard lymphadenectomy : This include para esophageal lymph node , subcarinal lymph node right leave para bronchial lymph node . 2 . Extended lymphadenectomy : This include standard lymphadenectomy plus right apical node , right recurrent nerve node right paratracheal node . 3 . Total lymphadenectomy : This include extended lymphadenectomy plus left apical node plus left recurrent nerve paratracheal node . Field III . This refer cervical compartment include clearance omohyoid triangle spar sternocleidomastoid muscle internal jugular vein . The cranial landmark cricoid cartilage caudal landmark upper margin clavicle . Three-field lymphadenectomy : The type resection include lymph node clearance Fields I III total type Field II lymphadenectomy . Two field lymphadenectomy : The type resection include lymph node clearance Field I type lymphadenectomy Field II . Standard mediastinal lymphadenectomy do patient ; special effort make dissect supracarinal compartment unless grossly enlarge lymph node see . Three field lymphadenectomy Two field lymphadenectomy Operative time , blood loss , blood product replacement intraoperative detail record proforma . Patients shift postoperatively intensive care unit ( ICU ) observation subsequently recovery high dependency ward stabilize . Postoperative detail include period postoperative ventilation , hemorrhage , pulmonary cardiac complication , arrhythmia , thoracic duct leak , anastomotic leak , wound infection recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis palsy record . Postoperative complication record per Annexure 5 . Postoperative mortality define 30-day mortality plus death discharge surgery . Patients start oral feed 8th 10th day absence anastomotic leak . The total duration ICU stay hospital stay also record . Follow Patients follow four six monthly first three year annually thereafter . A detailed history clinical examination do every follow quality speech , swallow record . Patients fixed cord postoperatively undergo laryngoscopy assess recovery function . Symptomatic patient investigate upper gastrointestinal endoscopy , CT scan , ultrasound haematological biochemical investigation . Asymptomatic patient routinely investigate .
