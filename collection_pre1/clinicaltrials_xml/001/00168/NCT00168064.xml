	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Nitrogen Mustard Treatment Mycosis Fungoides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The successful use mechlorethamine ( MCH ) topical agent treatment mycosis fungoides , form cutaneous T-cell lymphoma , first report late 1950s , provide rationale skin-directed chemotherapy minimize systemic toxicity . Since , multiple investigator demonstrate safety efficacy topically apply MCH treatment mycosis fungoides . This study evaluate efficacy ( non-inferiority ) , tolerability safety topical application MCH proprietary gel versus compound ointment formulation Aquaphor patient stage I IIA MF .</detailed_description>
