	<brief_summary>The specific aim examine Guinea-Bissau : - whether standard titre Schwarz ( SW ) standard-titre Edmonston-Zagreb ( EZ ) measles vaccine best vaccine strain use routine one-dose measles vaccination schedule two-dose measles vaccination schedule term antibody response , protection measles child survival , - whether standard-titre Edmonston-Zagreb ( EZ ) vaccine suitable use early two-dose schedule vaccinate 4½ 9 month age</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Two dose schedule : After failure high-titre measles vaccine , administer 6 month age suggest perform trial early two-dose measles vaccination schedule low age vaccination . The standard titre SW measles vaccine show associate non-specific beneficial effect child mortality ascribe protection measles . The two measles vaccine commonly use Expanded Programme Immunization ( EPI ) standard titre SW standard titre EZ vaccine . Surprisingly , two vaccine never compare randomised trial child mortality end-point , clear would suitable use two-dose vaccination schedule . From 1995 2002 , child BHP study area include early two-dose measles vaccination trial 6 month age . The child randomise either one-dose group receive inactivate polio vaccine ( IPV ) 6 month age measles vaccine 9 month age , two-dose group receive two dos measles vaccine 6 9 month age . For first 6 month trial , standard-titre EZ measles vaccine use , rest trial standard-titre SW vaccine use . Results trial show early two-dose schedule increase coverage considerably provide good protection measles among infant recommend one-dose 9 month age schedule . The EZ SW vaccine use two different cohort - direct comparison possible , EZ vaccine seem boost secondary immune response well SW vaccine . Further , SW vaccine less able induce protective level antibody use 6 month age EZ vaccine . The preliminary data long-term vaccine efficacy support SW vaccine might less suitable EZ vaccine use early measles vaccine schedule ( unpublished data ) . On hand , trial perform 1980 's Mexico Bangladesh show administration standard-titre EZ vaccine infant young 4-6 month age give good seroconversion result . The Global Measles Strategic Plan 2001-2005 developed WHO UNICEF state child guarantee second opportunity measles vaccination either campaign routine immunisation . The best strategy protection infant live overcrowded urban African society run great risk contract measles recommend age immunisation , probably early vaccination follow second vaccination later childhood . If , vaccination campaign strategy , administration first vaccine postpone could dramatically increase measles incidence child age vaccination . To add vaccination campaign yet evaluate Africa term childhood mortality relative routine schedule . Some child might get two , three even measles vaccine uncontrolled necessarily beneficial manner . Thus find best schedule vaccine strain use routine two-dose schedule seem good approach region . We thus propose conduct study compare standard-titre SW measles vaccine standard-titre EZ measles vaccine one- two-dose schedule provide first dose 9 month age , randomise child 18 month age receive either additional dose vaccine nothing . The group compare term seroconversion-rate , proportion non-protective antibody level , geometric mean titer antibody level , vaccine efficacy , child mortality . Further plan test standard-titre EZ vaccine early two-dose schedule provide first dose 4½ month age second dose 9 month age ( see also non-specific effect vaccination ) . It likely measles elimination vaccination campaign take place study area trial . The date vaccination type measles vaccine use campaign note , well simultaneous vitamin A supplementation ; information include final data-analyses . Non-specific effect vaccination : The measles vaccine several community study different part world show non-specific beneficial effect child mortality . That mean protection death mediate vaccine exceed disease specific effect , ie vaccine prevents death cause measles , also death , presumably due non-specific immune stimulation provide protection infection measles . For example , war Guinea-Bissau break June 7 , 1998 , population flee health care system break . There routine vaccination least 3 month period . Hence , war start group infant randomise early SW measles vaccination 6 month IPV receive standard-titre SW measles vaccine 9 month would otherwise give . This natural experiment represent first randomise study mortality effect SW measles vaccine . The mortality ratio measles vaccinate child 0.29 ( 0.08-1.03 , p=0.041 ) 0.31 ( 0.10-0.94 ) first 3 7 month war . Contrary measles vaccination , diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis ( DTP ) vaccination associate negative effect child mortality . Current study indicate negative effect DTP may neutralize subsequent measles vaccination . The design propose trial allow u test whether negative effect DTP vaccine , administer EPI-programme 6 , 10 14 week age , revert administration measles vaccine 4 week last DTP vaccination around 4½ month age . Non-specific effect vaccination sex-specific . Girls benefit beneficial non-specific effect , suffer apparently harmful non-specific effect vaccination . Non-specific effect measles vaccination may also show interaction season , beneficial effect measles vaccination large dry season ( unpublished ) , suggest unknown immunological factor play role . Season large influence health West Africa , morbidity mortality , well immunologic parameter delayed-type hypersensitivity , T-cells , thymus size measles antibody level associate season . We intend investigate interaction sex season measles vaccination assure data morbidity immunologic parameter collect dry well rainy season . Time table : The study begin July 2003 , sample size 5.755 possible 2.000 child include per year , inclusion period trial 3 year .</detailed_description>
