	<brief_summary>The purpose study assist understand effective parameter TMS Depressive Disorders . Most research conduct use high frequency stimulation leave hemisphere.However , low frequency right hemisphere also show antidepressant property appear well tolerate . A promising approach improve response rTMS may combine high low frequency stimulation apply right side brain . In approach , high frequency stimulation provide first may 'prime ' pre-prepare brain low frequency stimulation way enhance response . Participants randomise receive active placebo prim stimulation.If participant respond treatment condition 10 session apply two week period offer 10 session high frequency leave sided TMS treatment . Alternatively , participant respond favorably may continue treatment condition another 10 session .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary outcome measure use MADRS ( Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) . This administered baseline fortnightly basis . At study end response criterion define 50 % reduction total MADRS score remission define MADRS score less equal 10 . Other outcome measure administer fortnightly : BPRS ( Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ) , CORE ( measure melancholic symptom ) , BDI ( Beck Depression Inventory ) , CGI ( Clinical Global Impression Scale ) , GAF ( Global Assessment Functioning Scale ) . A cognitive battery also administer . Inclusion Criteria : - Moderate severe depressive symptom indicate MADRS &gt; 20 - Failure respond minimum two antidepressant medication - No increase initiation new antidepressant therapy four week prior enter trial Exclusion Criteria - Have unstable medical condition , neurological disorder history seizure disorder currently pregnant lactate - Previous brain injury surgery , metal clip , plat metal item head , cardiac pacemaker - In opinion investigator , sufficient suicide risk require immediate electro-convulsive therapy - Have current DSMIV diagnosis substance abuse dependence disorder , diagnosis personality disorder another axis 1 disorder</detailed_description>
