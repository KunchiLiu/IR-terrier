	<brief_summary>Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) highly disable group condition include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , acute chronic interstitial pneumonia , connective tissue diseases sarcoidosis . People ILD frequently experience breathlessness exertion , limit ability undertake daily activity . People ILD report poor quality life due low level physical functioning vitality , high level breathlessness fatigue . There treatment ILD available limited impact quality life . The aim study assess effect Pulmonary Rehabilitation , consist specialised exercise training people lung disease , exercise capacity quality life people ILD . We hypothesis exercise train result reduce dyspnoea , improve exercise tolerance enhance quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) highly disable group condition include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , acute chronic interstitial pneumonia , connective tissue diseases sarcoidosis . People ILD frequently experience breathlessness exertion , limit ability undertake daily activity reduce health-related quality life.Available treatment ILD prove largely ineffective , offer improvement survival demonstrate limited impact quality life . Aims Research 1 . Evaluate effect Pulmonary Rehabilitation exercise capacity quality life patient ILD 2 . Determine physiological response Pulmonary Rehabilitation patient ILD 3 . Determine relationship aetiology severity ILD effect Pulmonary Rehabilitation . Comparisons : 8 week exercise train compare control group ( maximal exercise capacity , functional exercise capacity , dyspnoea , quality life ) .</detailed_description>
