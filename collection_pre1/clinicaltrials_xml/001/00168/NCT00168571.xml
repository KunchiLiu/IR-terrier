	<brief_summary>Few data exist long-term persistence measles antibody vaccination West African infant . The data exist indicate antibody titres decline rapidly . Our data would first describe persistence measles antibody two dos measles vaccine , study would allow u identify unprotected child offer revaccination . Since persistence measles antibodies crucial importance measles control , study contribute significantly exist knowledge might important implication future eradication programme .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective To determine persistence measles antibody among child receive either one two dos Edmonston-Zagreb ( EZ ) Schwarz ( SW ) measles vaccine . Background The World Health Organization target measles eradication year 2010 , although measles incidence fall drastically many part world , several factor could hinder eradication goal . First , indication improve measles immunisation coverage world wide , vaccination coverage fell region world 1997 1998 , except Western Pacific , general measles immunisation coverage come 72 % . Very high vaccination coverage â‰¥ 95 % need interrupt transmission highly contagious measles virus . Primary secondary vaccine failure constitute another significant problem measles control , HIV pandemic contributes increase vaccine failure , permit transmission measles virus despite high rate immunisation coverage . Sub-clinical measles find contribute measles immunity boost antibody level , less circulation wild measles virus secondary vaccine failure may represent special problem term wan immunity , problem probably pronounce among vaccinated early , still data relevant problem . Thus , although effective measles vaccine available , still need find optimal way immunise different epidemiological setting . In area high measles transmission early two-dose measles vaccination schedule recommend prevention measles age group normal age vaccination , mean raise vaccination coverage general . We conduct two-dose trial two different strain measles vaccine Guinea-Bissau , find risk vaccinate low two-dose group one-dose group , relative efficacy two-dose versus one-dose schedule high among child normal age vaccination . Further , find one two dos EZ vaccine result 1 % child unprotected 18 month age , one two dos SW result 3 % 9 % unprotected , respectively . The EZ vaccine , SW vaccine , able boost antibody response significantly revaccination 9 month age child moderate level antibody . We therefore propose study long-term persistence measles antibody cohort find rather strike difference protection 18 month age accord vaccine strain number dos find whether measles antibody level maintain time wan immunity problem , since could important implication global measles control elimination . Methods With 85 % seroconverters one-dose group would able detect difference 10 % number non-seroconverters sample size 400 child blood sample group . Among 6,900 child 18 month blood sample ( 10 % loss follow-up 6 18 month age ) , include child receive EZ vaccine blood sample 6-7 year age . Available 450 sample 18 month age , 20 % loss follow-up total 360 child group . Among child receive SW vaccine plan follow half child 6-7 year age , half 3 year later 9-10 year age . Including first 2,000 child 18 month blood sample able include 1,600 child study 20 % loss follow-up . Thus 400 child arm study ( one dose / two dose ) 6-7 9-10 year age . Children unprotective measles antibody level offer revaccination .</detailed_description>
