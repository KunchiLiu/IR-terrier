	<brief_summary>Objective It objective test whether use prophylactic antibiotic measles infection reduce incidence post-measles pneumonia and/or admission hospital 50 % . The possible impact complication severe measles also measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Antibiotics Measles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The case-fatality rate measles develop country still high , particularly infant . It estimate measles responsible one million death per year , death due complication disease . Most severe complication measles develop country due secondary bacterial viral infection cause pneumonia diarrhea . A study fifty show benefit treat measles case prophylactically antibiotic , together fear develop antibiotic resistance give rise dogma harmful give prophylactic antibiotic measles infection . A recent study Niakhar , rural area Senegal , show child treat prophylactic antibiotic low frequency respiratory complication . In 1987 decide child young 3 year age see within first 2 week onset measles symptom treat antibiotic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 7 day irrespective whether sign bacterial infection time clinical examination . Children young 3 year age receive prophylactic antibiotic less likely respiratory symptom day 8 15 illness child age group receive antibiotic see first time day 8 15 ( relative risk , 0.37 ( 0.15 0.94 ) ) . Further , case-fatality rate adjust age decline 2-fold 1983-1986 1987-1991 ( mortality ratio , 0.41 ( 0.21 0.81 ) ) . As study unbiased evaluation , would desirable randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled trial prophylactic use antibiotic measles infection . This could potentially prevent large number measles-related complication death . Participation randomization Measles case include study receive treatment either co-trimoxazole identical look placebo . The co-trimoxazole placebo pack identical look sack mark randomization number . The code broken end study period . Informed consent obtain parent guardian . It explain study examine whether antibiotic prevent late complication , know whether indeed case . Therefore one group receive active treatment , another group receive placebo , know group measles case belong . It also explain want participate , management measles case otherwise do study area . Measles case include study receive standard treatment .</detailed_description>
