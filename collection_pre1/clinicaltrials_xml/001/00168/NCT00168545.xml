	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES - General : To investigate immunological background non-specific effect diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis ( DTP ) measles vaccine child mortality - Specific : Examine cytokine response possible association morbidity study DTP vaccinate child randomise receive measles vaccine vaccine 4½ month age . ( All child receive measles vaccine 9 month age )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-specific effect vaccines The idea vaccines non-specific effect first propose 1991 study Senegal , West Africa . It discover child receive high-titre measles vaccine ( HT ) 6 month age high mortality child receive standard titre measles vaccine ( STD ) 9 month age . The difference find girl . A study Haiti confirm effect . Since child vaccinate HT low mortality equivalent receive measles vaccine , difference mortality recipient HT vaccine STD vaccine explain non-specific beneficial effect STD measles vaccine rather harmful effect HT vaccine . The non-specific beneficial effect STD measles vaccine child mortality reconfirm many data-sets . Also BCG vaccine associate striking effect child mortality reduce mortality 50 % . Further , among BCG vaccinate child , BCG scar positive tuberculin reaction associate 55 % low mortality follow 12 month among child negative tuberculin reaction BCG scar . The effect OPV difficult separate effect BCG DTP vaccine since OPV normally give together vaccine . There , though , period without DTP Bissau due global shortage vaccine , compare case fatality hospital child receive OPV child receive prescribed OPV DTP . Children receive OPV 3-fold low mortality child receive vaccine . Data OPV vaccination campaign take place Guinea-Bissau also suggest non-specific beneficial effect recipient . Further , study Chile Soviet Union suggest OPV beneficial effect mortality morbidity . In contrast , DTP , HBV inactivate polio vaccine ( IPV ) seem exert non-specific detrimental effect child mortality , although finding DTP consider controversial recent review . Current study indicate negative effect DTP may neutralize subsequent measles vaccination . It strike vaccine non-specific beneficial effect live , whereas vaccine apparently harmful effect kill . Results animal study show attenuated live vaccine tend induce Th1 response offer good protection severe disease correspond inactivated vaccine , tend induce Th2 response . So far , study examine whether effect differ male female animal . One study report BCG-vaccinated female mouse well protect malaria parasite male mouse ( 31 ) . There therefore urgent need conduct study help uncover immunology behind non-specific effect . Sex-specific effect All epidemiological study carry far confirms observation non-specific effect sex-specific . Live vaccine ( measles , BCG , OPV ) beneficial effect particularly good girl whereas inactivate vaccine ( DTP , HBV , IPV ) negative effect girl . To date , immunological study examine whether routine vaccine affect immune system differently boys girl . We thus propose study , randomise control trial measles vaccination take place Guinea-Bissau , immunology non-specific effect vaccination , interaction sex . Specifically , among child receive 3 recommended dos DTP , able compare cytokine antibody profile child receive early dose measles vaccine 4½ month age child receive additional vaccine age .</detailed_description>
