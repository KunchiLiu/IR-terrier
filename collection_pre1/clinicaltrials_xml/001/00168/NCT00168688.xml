	<detailed_description>Prenatal maternal micronutrient supplementation suggest mean reduce proportion low birth weight baby low-income country . The effect prenatal multi-micronutrient supplement birth weight perinatal mortality study randomise control trial among 2100 pregnant woman Guinea-Bissau . Women 37 week pregnant individually randomise daily supplement delivery identically look tablet contain 1 ) Iron ( 60 mg ) + folate ( 400 µg ) , 2 ) One recommend dietary allowance ( RDA ) 5 mineral 10 vitamin , include iron ( 30 mg ) folate ( 400 µg ) , 3 ) Two RDA 's 5 mineral 10 vitamin , include iron ( 30 mg ) folate ( 800 µg ) . Supplements provide known excess fortnightly home visit delivery . Compliance assess tablet count . Women interview age , civil status , obstetric history socio-economic status enrolment . Maternal anthropometry measure enrolment , delivery , eight week delivery . Maternal malaria parasitaemia haemoglobin measure enrolment eight week delivery . Maternal status wide range micronutrient assess enrolment eight week delivery sub-cohort 600 woman . Further , survival infant follow 3 year age , within routine Bandim Health Project surveillance system . Women provide impregnated bed net weekly malaria prophylaxis delivery . Women high malaria parasitaemia enrolment addition give full treatment enrolment . Sample size consideration : A sample size 638 woman treatment group require detect reduction perinatal mortality 9 % 5 % le treatment group use 80 % power 5 % significance level . With expect loss follow 10 % , 2100 woman require . With sample size 2100 study able detect least 75 g difference , i.e . 2.5 % change birth weight .</detailed_description>
