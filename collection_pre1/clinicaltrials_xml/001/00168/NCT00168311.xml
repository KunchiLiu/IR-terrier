	<brief_summary>There pilot data suggest therapeutic value rTMS apply left prefrontal cortex treatment negative symptom . Neuroimaging study demonstrate abnormal activity region patient experience negative symptom . Finally rTMS apply high frequency show capacity up-regulate cortical activity way would provide explanation therapeutic response . The study involve participant receive 15 session high frequency rTMS treatment apply bilaterally prefrontal cortex 3 week period sham rTMS . Following double blind phase , participant randomise placebo treatment offer 15 session active treatment . In addition , ppTMS ( paired pulse TMS ) conduct prior onset treatment completion course , mean measure cortical inhibition facilitation . NIRS ( Near Infra red spectroscopy ) also conduct prior , first last treatment session allow monitoring oxygenate deoxygenated haemoglobin .</brief_summary>
