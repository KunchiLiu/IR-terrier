	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate humoral cell-mediated immune response trivalent subviron influenza vaccine pediatric liver transplant recipient . Additionally , researcher attempt correlate humoral cell-mediated immune response parameter may predict subject 's ability respond vaccine , time transplant , immunosuppressive agent , previous episode rejection cytomegalovirus infection , T-cell number T-cell response mitogens antigen . Understanding immune response influenza provide insight response trivalent subviron influenza vaccine vaccine develop agent bioterrorism , particular may use influenza related virus backbone . This single center , prospective comparative study humoral cell-mediated immune response trivalent subviron influenza vaccine 2004-2005 2005-2006 influenza season outpatient pediatric liver transplant recipient healthy sibling . There two study arm , liver transplant recipient ( n=44 ) healthy control ( n=22 ) . All study subject receive vaccine enrollment . Enrollment study extend 2005-2006 influenza season . The trivalent subviron influenza vaccine 2005-2006 influenza season differ 2004-2005 influenza season respect H3N2 viral strain . The cell-mediated humoral immune response patient two H3N2 viral strain analyze together separately assess potential difference immunogenicity two viral strain . Humoral cell-mediated immune response obtain baseline follow immunization . Healthy sibling use control ensure equal burden influenza disease among study participant . Participants involve study related procedure 8 month .</detailed_description>
