	<brief_title>9-valent CRM 197 Pneumococcal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elderly individual increase risk serious pneumococcal infection . The efficacy license pneumococcal vaccine also low risk population . The precise immunologic reason increase susceptibility decrease efficacy advance age unknown . Understanding improve response pneumococcal vaccine person age 65 important step prevent serious illness . The propose study evaluate relative safety immunogenicity 9-valent CRM 197 protein-conjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide ( CRM-PS ) compare currently license 23-polysaccharide ( PS ) vaccines elderly adult . In addition , response revaccination follow conjugate vaccine also evaluate . Outcome measurement include adverse effect , standard ELISA measurement serotype specific antibody , well antibody response carrier protein , effect functional antibody status nasal carriage S. pneumoniae . The study conduct 180 adult 65 year age old receive pneumococcal vaccine within last 5 year . Patients assign 1 3 group random double blind manner . One dose vaccine 1 dose placebo 2 dose 9-valent CRM-PS vaccine administer interval 4 month compare single dose PS vaccine 1 dose placebo . Subjects evaluate local system side effect use 7-day diary card clinical telephone follow-up . Serologic evaluation do 1 month follow vaccination placebo . Subjects receive CRM-PS receive dose PS vaccine 8 month first dose vaccine , potential prim previous conjugate vaccine assess measure quality quantity antibody response revaccination . Participants involve study related procedure 268 day .</detailed_description>
