	<brief_title>Islet Transplantation Type 1 Diabetics Using Edmonton Protocol Steroid Free Immunosuppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LAY SUMMARY : More 1 million North Americans type 1 diabetes . Each year , approximately 30,000 new case type 1 diabetes diagnose United States . Type 1 diabetes destroys islet , cluster cell within pancreas produce insulin . Insulin hormone many effect . However , important effect insulin control level sugar blood . People Type 1 diabetes longer produce insulin must take insulin injection live . Despite steady improvement management disease , victim remain increased risk stroke , heart attack , kidney failure , amputation , blindness , nerve damage premature death . The life expectancy teenager reduce thirty year time onset disease . Unfortunately , many type 1 diabetic control blood sugar spite careful monitoring frequent injection insulin . This group patient consider labile `` brittle '' diabetes . These `` brittle '' diabetic often wide swing blood sugar level life threaten . Hypoglycemia , low blood sugar , occurs much insulin bloodstream . When occurs , vital patient eat drink something right away increase blood sugar . Many diabetic lose ability recognize blood sugar get dangerously low . These episode hypoglycemia lead coma , possibly death , recognize treat right away . Patients also experience extreme increase blood sugar , hyperglycemia , result emotional physical stress . Hyperglycemia result dehydration , confusion , condition call ketoacidosis , lead death . When happen , insulin must give soon possible . Islet transplantation restore body 's ability make insulin , turn , restore normal blood sugar level . Since 1960 's , doctor scientist attempt replace islet function perform whole organ pancreas transplantation . While result pancreas transplantation improve dramatically recent year , approach largely limited patient kidney disease also need kidney transplant . This risk associate surgical procedure immunosuppressive drug require prevent rejection destruction transplant pancreas body 's immune system . Transplantation whole pancreas require major operation do incision abdomen . The patient must general anesthesia , asleep , entire procedure . Recent clinical experience suggest islet transplantation may useful approach correct diabetes human . Islet transplantation offer direct approach treatment type 1 diabetes . A large number experimental study carry many laboratory last decade document beneficial effect islet transplant experimental animal . These experiment confirm efficiency safety islet transplantation . The inability isolate enough islet single pancreas one obstacle successful islet transplantation . A certain number islet must isolate , separate , single pancreas order use transplant . If minimum number islet obtain , islet effectively reverse diabetes . Progress isolate islet human pancreas dramatic last several year . Advances equipment technology lead increase number islet isolate single pancreas . After successful isolation , islet inject catheter patient 's liver thirty-minute procedure . A group doctor University Alberta Edmonton , Canada promise result human islet transplantation . Normal sugar level document human islet transplant . Also , recent improvement immunosuppressive drug treatment result sustained insulin-independence select type 1 diabetic patient . The traditional method transplant immunosuppression include use form steroid drug . Steroids find injure kill islet transplant . The doctor Edmonton , Canada establish immunosuppression formula use steroid . The objective study Emory University reproduce successful result human islet transplantation achieve doctor University Alberta use steroid free immunosuppression . The Emory Islet Transplant Program enroll ten patient , age 18 65 , study . Each ten patient receive least 2 islet transplant 2 different organ donor . A third transplant may require base patient 's insulin requirement 1st two transplant . Each patient place immunosuppressive drug prevent body reject destroy transplanted islet . Each patient his/her blood sugar level insulin requirement monitor closely transplant . The patient also various test determine diabetic complication improve , remain , become worse . The patient ask record episode hypoglycemia low blood sugar participate study . Emory examine whether decrease often episodes occur . Patients also undergo regular eye exam document retinal change improvement may occur transplant . At time know whether islet transplantation slow stops progression common diabetic complication . More experience research need determine . One focus research study diabetic complication patient receive islet transplant . The major goal Emory Islet Transplant Program patient participate study free need insulin injection 2 islet transplant . Because many advance make islet transplantation , transplant team Emory would like participate promising treatment type 1 diabetes , importantly , help suffer disease become free daily insulin injection avoid devastate complication happen result diabetes .</detailed_description>
