	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety experimental smallpox vaccine ( MVA : Modified Vaccinia Ankara ) compare body 's immune ( system fight disease ) response vaccine . Participants assign 1 6 study group . Each group include 12 subject , 10 receive modify smallpox vaccine two receive placebo , inactive substance . The vaccine administer 1 3 way : skin ; muscle ; muscle skin . Groups A B receive Dryvax® 6-15 month initial MVA vaccine ; group C , D , E , F receive Dryvax® 6 month initial MVA vaccine . Study procedure include document side effect 14 day vaccination , electrocardiogram ( picture hearts activity ) blood sample . Participants involve study related procedure 18 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The emergence smallpox potential agent bioterrorism heighten concern vulnerability population infection agent , lead proposal undertake large scale smallpox immunization military personnel `` first responder '' United States , include certain health care worker . A particularly promising vaccine approach development effective , yet less reactogenic vaccine smallpox use Modified Vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) vaccine . Despite establish efficacy smallpox vaccination , parameter protective immunity smallpox infection incompletely understood . This phase I/II trial conduct placebo control double-blind , randomize allocation study product . The purpose study assess safety immunogenicity ACAM 3000 MVA healthy vaccinia-naïve adult subject . Participants include 72 healthy , male female , Boston metropolitan area . Six dose regimen study initially : 10^6 10^7 tissue culture infectious dose 50 ( TCID50 ) administer intradermally 10^7 10^8 TCID50 administer intramuscularly subcutaneously 2 immunization 1 month apart . Each arm comprise 12 subject , 10 receive ACAM3000 MVA 2 receive placebo . A subsequent vaccinia vaccination offer patient . Consenting participant Groups A B receive vaccinia ( Dryvax® ) inoculation 6 15 month initial MVA / placebo vaccination . Consenting participant group C , D , E F receive Dryvax® inoculation approximately 6 month initial MVA / placebo vaccination , coincide plan visit 13 . Assessment safety carry observation measurement acute clinical laboratory evidence reaction toxicity ; include clinical , electrocardiographic laboratory evidence myopericarditis . Assessment immunogenicity carry measurement humoral cell-mediated immune response ACAM 3000 MVA vaccinia , perform blood sample obtain various time prior immunization one year period study . Response vaccinia assess clinically ( effect `` take '' ) result correlate immune response MVA . Subjects follow reactogenicity . Clinical assessment blood sample obtain sequentially immunogenicity determination .</detailed_description>
