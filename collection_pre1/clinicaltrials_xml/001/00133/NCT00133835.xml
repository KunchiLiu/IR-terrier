	<brief_title>Comparison Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy ( ESWL ) Alone ESWL Plus Endoscopy Painful Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic drainage main pancreatic duct establish method treatment painful obstructive calcify chronic pancreatitis ( CP ) . It involve disintegration calcification use extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( ESWL ) follow endoscopic removal stone fragment , possibly associate stent insertion . A pilot study suggest ESWL alone calcify CP follow spontaneous elimination stone fragment pain relief , without sphincterotomy . After ESWL alone , exocrine function find return normal value case . Potential benefit include low cost morbidity well wider availability compare endoscopic technique . The primary outcome randomize control trial compare relapse pain 2 year treatment ESWL alone endoscopic treatment , consist ESWL follow endoscopic stone extraction . Secondary outcome include comparison technical result ( assessed abdominal CT Scan 1 week last intervention secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance 1 month ) , complication rate , treatment-related cost group . Patients eligible participate study accord follow criterion : Inclusion criterion : - painful chronic pancreatitis ( abdominal pain attack precede 12 month ) ; - least 1 calcify stone great 4 mm one ax cephalic corporeal portion main pancreatic duct upstream duct dilation ; - write informed consent obtain patient . Exclusion criterion : - history treatment pancreas use ESWL , endoscopy , surgery ; - pancreatic collection great 2 cm diameter magnetic resonance CT Scan ; - alkaline phosphatase level great twice upper limit normal value sign cholangitis ; - age 18 year ; - pregnancy lactation . Pretherapeutic work-up include detailed medical history ( include date first episode typical abdominal pain , date diagnosis CP , number episode pain last year , alcohol intake , pain continuous intermittent last episode , medication , intensity last episode pain 10-point scale previously describe ) , blood chemistry , stool sampling ( elastase measurement ) , triolein breath test , plain abdominal film take four classical position ( leave anterior oblique , right anterior oblique , lateral , supine ) , CT Scan without contrast medium injection , secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( S-MRCP ) . After informed consent refer physician obtain , patient ask participate study . If patient accepts , oral write consent , ( ) randomize ESWL endoscopy group open opaque seal envelope number accord table random number . ESWL perform patient use electromagnetic lithotriptor previously describe . Shock-waves focus obstruct stone ( multiple stone present , responsible MPD obstruction identify compare plain abdominal film , CT Scan S-MRCP ) . ESWL session repeat necessary , stone fragmentation obtain , confirm abdominal plain film center targeted area pancreas . At time , treatment consider terminate ESWL group , patient endoscopy group undergo endoscopy immediately , endoscopic extraction stone fragment possibly associate stent insertion accord previously publish criterion technique . Cross-over : ESWL group , elimination fragment observe one week last ESWL , endoscopic drainage main pancreatic duct carry time case continuous pain . For patient without continuous pain , delay spontaneous elimination fragment seek CT Scan S-MRCP 2 month last ESWL . Endoscopic drainage main pancreatic duct propose follow-up patient present painful attack CP . Follow-up consist clinical examination 1 month treatment every 6 month thereafter . Data collect include pain relapse , ESWL , endoscopic surgical procedure , weight change , plus seemingly unrelated medical treatment . In addition , S-MRCP perform 1 month treatment . Triolein breath test perform 1 month 1 year . Sampling stool ( elastase measurement ) obtain every year . Costs calculate start day first treatment previously describe . Costs directly relate treatment pain procedure-related complication ( e.g. , diabetes ) disregard .</detailed_description>
