	<detailed_description>Influenza occur annual basis , produce significant mortality year , mainly underlie condition extremes age . This study placebo-controlled trial examine efficacy live attenuate inactivated influenza vaccine , immune correlate protection ; study take place Michigan three year period , target adult age 18-49 year . Both vaccine preparation license age group . In first year , participant randomly assign receive one two licensed vaccine placebo . In second year , participant receipt vaccine ( update accord national recommendation ) placebo continue assign first year return participant , new enrollee randomly assign intervention . In third year , duration immunity evaluate , intervention give . In study year , blood specimen serologic study specimens virus identification collect number laboratory study perform possible achieve study 's objective . The primary annual study outcome efficacy proportion subject laboratory-confirmed symptomatic influenza A B illness , define influenza virus isolate tissue culture throat swab obtain participant episode illness meeting influenza case definition confirm influenza fluorescent antibody polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) technique ; serologic confirmation influenza infection participant episode illness meeting influenza case definition , specifically 4-fold rise hemagglutinin inhibition assay ( HAI ) antibody titer circulate influenza strain post-vaccination ( pre-season ) post-season pair serum . The influenza case definition illness least one respiratory symptom ( cough nasal congestion ) least one constitutional symptom ( fever feverishness , chill body ache ) . Subjects evaluate serious adverse event throughout annual study period . Annually , proportion participant local reaction first seven day adverse reaction first thirty day vaccine receipt compare recipient placebo .</detailed_description>
