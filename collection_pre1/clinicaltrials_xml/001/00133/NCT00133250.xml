	<brief_title>Value Abciximab Patients With AMI Undergoing Primary PCI After Clopidogrel Pretreatment ( BRAVE 3 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal reperfusion therapy acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) effective restoration coronary blood flow reduction infarct size . Recently , researcher able achieve excellent result primary stenting plus abciximab term reduction infarct size improvement clinical outcome STOPAMI trial . This strategy provide clear benefit compare fibrinolysis . On basis data publish last 2 year , hospital without angioplasty facility well possibility improve result primary treatment patient AMI immediately refer patient highly experienced center coronary intervention . There increase interest ass additional advantage pharmacologic reperfusion approach readily applicable time window presentation arrival catheterization room . Two study show result PCI patient AMI pretreated fibrinolysis may even unfavorable achieve angioplasty alone . Glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa blocker abciximab show improve result primary PCI AMI . However , rapidly effective antiplatelets therapy available time study benefit abciximab perform . Recent study show high , 600 mg load dose clopidogrel significantly rapidly act maximal inhibition platelet aggregation achieve within 2 hour administration . In ISAR-REACT trial , high load dose clopidogrel well tolerate , associate low frequency procedural complication use abciximab offer clinically measurable benefit 30 day . Comparison : Abciximab ( bolus+infusion 12h ) versus Placebo ( bolus+infusion 12h ) pre-treatment 600 mg clopidogrel .</detailed_description>
