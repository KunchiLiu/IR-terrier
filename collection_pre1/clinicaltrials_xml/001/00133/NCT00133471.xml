	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare body 's reaction immune response receive different strength H9N2 influenza virus vaccine without adjuvant give arm muscle . Study participant include 96 healthy adult , age 18-34 . The 4 dosage experimental H9N2 vaccine test study follow : 3.75 , 7.5 , 15 , 30-mcg ( without MF59 adjuvant ) . Participants vaccinate Days 0 28 . Participants record vaccine side effect diary 7 day follow vaccination . Participants return clinic day 2 7 vaccination . Blood sample collect 7 day follow vaccination . Serum nasal wash specimen collect vaccination 4 week injection ( 0 , 4 , 8 week ) . Participants involve study related procedure 8 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inactivated Influenza A/H9N2 Vaccine With Without MF59 Adjuvant Ambulatory Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal study assess safety 4 different dosage purify monovalent surface antigen ( SA ) influenza A/H9N2 virus vaccine without MF59 adjuvant administer intramuscularly ambulatory adult . The hypothesis dosage level adjuvanted nonadjuvanted vaccine well tolerate . The primary objective project evaluate safety 4 dosage level monovalent surface antigen ( SA ) influenza A/H9N2 virus vaccine give without MF59 adjuvant . The primary endpoint frequency severity solicit local systemic adverse event vaccine dosage level group . The secondary objective project determine immunogenicity 4 dosage level monovalent surface antigen ( SA ) influenza A/H9N2 virus vaccine give without MF59 adjuvant . The secondary endpoint include follow : proportion subject vaccine dosage group achieve serum HAI titer least 1:32 one month second vaccination ; geometric mean titer ( GMT ) serum HAI antibody influenza A/H9N2 virus one month second vaccination ; rate significant increase titer pre- post-immunization serum sample ( define seroconversion-i.e. , increase titer &lt; 1:4 pre-immunization least 1:8 vaccination , 4-fold great increase titer pre- post-immunization sample ) 28 day vaccination ( day 28 56 ) ; proportion subject 4-fold great increase percent HA-specific antibody nasal wash specimen vaccine group . The study double-blind evaluation 4 dosage level study vaccine . The 4 dosage level test 3.75- , 7.5- , 15- , 30-mcg HA vaccine strain without MF59 adjuvant . Because dosage level low total hemagglutinin content FLUADÂ® vaccine use Europe , subject enrolled dosage adjuvant group concurrently use randomize , double-blind study design . Ninety-six person 18-34 year age enrol . A single lot monovalent inactivate SA influenza A/H9N2 vaccine use throughout trial . All injection administer 0.5-mL volume deltoid muscle . Screening safety laboratory examination assess first dose 7 day vaccination . Assessments reactogenicity do least 20 minute vaccination , clinic 2 7 day inoculation , via diary card seven day vaccination , via phone contact 7 month first vaccination serious adverse event entire study period . Serum nasal wash sample collect day 0 , 28 , 56 used measure immunogenicity vaccine preparation . Participants involve study related procedure 8 month .</detailed_description>

On concomitant medication except contraceptive medication . Normal screen laboratory value . Known allergy egg component vaccine . Prior receipt influenza A/H9N2 vaccine . Abnormal screen laboratory value ( laboratory value must within normal limit ) . Pregnancy , desire become pregnant next 3 month , lactation . Immunosuppression result underlie illness treatment . Use oral parenteral steroid , highdose inhaled steroid ( &gt; 800 mcg per day beclomethasone dipropionate equivalent ) , immunosuppressive cytotoxic drug . Active neoplastic disease history hematologic malignancy . Acute chronic condition ( opinion investigator ) would render vaccination unsafe would interfere evaluation response ( include limit following : know chronic liver disease , significant renal disease , unstable progressive neurologic disorder , diabetes mellitus , transplant recipient ) . Use experimental vaccine medication within month prior study entry , expect use experimental license vaccine blood/blood product 1 month period inoculation study vaccine . Receipt immunoglobulin blood product within 3 month prior enrollment . Receipt license vaccine within precede 2 week ( inactivated vaccine ) 4 week ( live vaccine ) . History severe reaction follow vaccination contemporary influenza vaccine . Subject enrol another clinical trial . Study personnel ( person identify study personnel log ) . Any condition opinion investigator would interfere interpretation evaluation vaccine .</criteria>
