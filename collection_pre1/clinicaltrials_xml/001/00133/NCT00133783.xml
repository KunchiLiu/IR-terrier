	<brief_summary>Calcitonin , calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRPs ) , adrenomedullin , amylin belong unique group peptide hormones important regulation calcium balance , neurotransmission , cardiovascular homeostasis , glucose metabolism . We , investigator Chang Gung Memorial Hospital , recently identify intermedin novel peptide hormone belonging unique peptide ligand family . Adrenomedullin 52-amino-acid peptide one potent vasodilator . Plasma adrenomedullin elevate variety pathological condition hypertension , renal failure , heart failure , septic shock . CGRPα CGRPβ 37-amino acid neuropeptides ; primarily release sensory nerve ; play important role regulate peripheral vascular tone control blood flow various organ . Human mature intermedin encode 40-amino-acid express mainly adrenocorticotrophs anterior intermediate pituitary lobe . Intermedin signal calcitonin receptor-like receptor ( CRLR ) /receptor activity-modifying protein ( RAMP ) receptor complex , CRLR/RAMP signal proven critical vascular tone regulation . Based finding , document intraperitoneal administration intermedin dose-dependently suppress blood pressure normal Sprague-Dawley rat . In addition , preliminary vitro vivo study demonstrate ovariectomy lead tenfold reduction intermedin transcript expression pituitary rat whereas subsequent estrogen treatment increase pituitary intermedin expression level similar intact rat . Taken together , propose pituitary-derived intermedin regulate estrogen exhibit potent hypotensive effect . To address hypothesis , Specific Aim 1 , investigate regulation secretion expression intermedin vitro vivo use cultured pituitary cell oophorectomized rat . In Specific Aim 2 , study molecular mechanism estrogen stimulate intermedin gene expression . In Specific Aim 3 , demonstrate estrogen-dependent regulation intermedin represent critical link regulation blood pressure woman , study relationship blood pressure blood intermedin level use cross-sectional study . Our study provide good understand mechanism sex hormone modulate blood pressure open new window postmenopausal hypertension treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pituitary Derived-Intermedin Estrogen-Modulated Factor Reducing Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim : Validation intermedin represent estrogen-regulated vasoactive hormone pituitary Hypothesis : Intermedin mediator vaso-regulatory effect estrogen . Rationale : In Preliminary Study , show intermedin pituitary-derived hypotensive factor signal CRLR/RAMP receptor complex vessel endothelium . Based study relate hormone , adrenomedullin CGRP , intermedin likely reduce blood pressure exert vasodilator effect vascular bed . Earlier study show neuropeptide αCGRP predominately produce sensory neuron , serotonin selectively reduce CGRP secretion activate endogenous serotonin ( type 1 5-HT1 ) receptor calcium signal pathway . Deletion CGRP gene mutant mouse ( αCGRP-/- ) lead elevation mean arterial pressure , heart rate , peripheral vascular resistance sympathetic nervous activity compare wild-type mouse . The related peptide , adrenomedullin ( ADM ) , initially identify pheochromocytoma , show express various tissue include adrenal medulla , cardiovascular tissue , lung , kidney placenta . Plasma ADM elevate various condition include cardiovascular renal disorder septic shock , hypothesize ADM may involve control circulation body fluid dynamic various organ . Studies mice deficient ADM show ADM indispensable cardiovascular development . The homozygous knockout ( Adm－/－ ) mouse exhibit embryonic lethal phenotype . Earlier study ADM gene promoter reveal , addition two transcription factor , nuclear factor interleukin-6 expression ( NF-IL6 ) activator protein 2 ( AP-2 ) , ADM gene expression regulate hypoxia inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) . Under hypoxia condition , HIF-1 bind hypoxia response element ( HRE ) ADM gene promoter promote ADM gene expression . Although outside focus present study , also detect putative HRE sequence intermedin gene promoter demonstrate hypoxia condition stimulate intermedin gene promoter activity , suggest HIF-1 could play role regulation intermedin gene expression . Unlike intermedin , expression CGRP ADM actively stimulate estrogen , suggest two related peptide directly associate cardiovascular effect estrogen . In female , 17β-estradiol produce ovary chief circulate estrogen increase vasodilatation inhibits response blood vessel injury . Studies Mercuro et al . show surgical-induced menopause cause increase peripheral vascular resistance blood pressure . Likewise , cross sectional study show four- fold increase incidence hypertension postmenopausal woman compare premenopausal individual ( 40 % post menopausal woman vs 10 % premenopausal woman ) . The rise systolic blood pressure per decade around 5mmHg great perimenopausal postmenopausal woman compare premenopausal woman . In addition demographic study , study show estrogen could dilate coronary brachial artery postmenopausal woman . A part vasodilatation hypotensive activity 17β-estradiol could explain ability modulate expression gene know influence vascular tone structure , ACE , rennin , angiotension type I ( AT1 ) receptor . However , none gene show specific direct target estrogen receptor responsible vasoprotective effect estrogens . Based finding intermedin hypotensive factor contains putative ERE sequence promoter region , propose intermedin pituitary-derived blood pressure modulate factor directly regulate ovarian estrogen . Based understanding , hypothesize regulation intermedin age individual estrogen deficiency could responsible postmenopausal hypertension . Because establish animal model suitable study naturally occur menopause , test hypothesis study relationship plasma intermedin concentration blood pressure among woman difference reproductive stage . Case Selection , Measurement Analysis Biophysical Biochemical Characteristics Premenopausal Postmenopausal Group : Eligible woman visit OB/GYN physician invite interview . They question general characteristic , lifestyle habit ( smoking , alcohol consumption , physical activity ) , medical history . During interview , blood pressure measure three time right arm , participant seat . A woman consider post menopausal menses naturally cease 12 month ( ) , bilateral oophorectomy hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy age 55 year . Office BP measure use mercury sphygmomanometer accord recommendation American Society Hypertension ( average three BP reading 5 min quiet sit position ) . Biophysical biochemical characteristic measure include last menses period , age , BMI , serum glucose ( AC PC ) , serum urine creatinine , plasma total cholesterol , HDL , LDL , triglyceride , FSH , LH , 17β-estradiol , progesterone , TSH , intermedin , prolactin . Blood specimen individual subject analyze single assay minimize variation . Odds ratio ( ORs ) elevate blood pressure correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) compute allowance age . Furthermore , order take account potential reciprocal confounding effect variable consider , factor significantly relate elevate blood pressure risk age adjust analysis subsequently include multiple logistic regression model fit method maximum likelihood . Women ask annually regular pap smear examination without medical disease eligible study group . The reproductive stage assign : - Premenopausal : report change menstrual cycle pattern ; - Early peri-menopausal : report change menstrual cycle frequency precede year bleed precede 3 month ; - Late peri-menopausal : menses precede 3-11 month ; - Postmenopausal : menses precede 12 month . Surgically-Induced Menopausal Group : This protocol include fertile woman suffer ovarian pathology without medical disease schedule undergo bilateral oophorectomy associate without hysterectomy . Patients suffer uterine pathology undergo hysterectomy serve control . Blood pressure biochemical characteristic measure one week surgery 1 , 3 , 6 12 month operation . All individual measurement blind hysterectomized/oophorectomized status patient . The entire data group report mean ± SE . Differences vascular parameter oophorectomized woman control value record prior follow surgery assess use pair unpaired Student ’ t-tests . ART Group : Women ART treatment due male tubal factor include . The day 3 hormone level ( E2 , progesterone , FSH , LH , TSH , prolactin , inhibin A , inhibin B activin ) blood pressure measure one month ART treatment . After gonadotropin administration , hormone blood pressure change measure recorded day 3 , day 7 day hCG injection well day oocyte retrieval . All biophysical biochemical characteristic continue follow 15th day embryo transfer end first trim pregnancy group .</detailed_description>
