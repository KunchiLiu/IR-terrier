	<brief_title>Abciximab , Clopidogrel Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ISAR-REACT-2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCIs ) establish therapeutic approach patient present acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , still unclear best antithrombotic therapy apply periprocedurally . The EPISTENT trial show add abciximab ( glycoprotein [ GP ] IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor ) therapy ticlopidine plus aspirin significantly reduce incidence ischemic complication ( death , myocardial infarction reinterventions ) coronary stent implantation . Ticlopidine also reduce procedural complication delay onset action coronary stenting replace clopidogrel , provide similar efficacy associate few side effect . Experimental study show 600 mg load dose clopidogrel safe act rapidly leading maximal inhibition platelet aggregation within 2 hour administration . In ISAR-REACT trial , 600 mg load dose clopidogrel well tolerate , associate low frequency early complication use abciximab offer clinically measurable benefit 30 day . Although patient ACS frequently treat `` cooling-off '' strategy &gt; 48 hour undergo PCI , ISAR-COOL trial demonstrate patient undergo PCI within 6-12 hour presentation ACS actually suffer low rate ischemic complication invasive approach delayed . However , patient ACS represent high risk subset may need potent antithrombotic regimen periprocedurally . Therefore , result ISAR REACT , perform low intermediate risk patient , generalize high risk patient . Comparison : All patient non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome undergo coronary angiography willing participate trial receive load dose 600 mg clopidogrel least 2 hour prior procedure . Eligible patient meet exclusion criterion angiography reveals PCI plan randomize receive either abciximab plus low-dose heparin , 70 units/kg , high dose heparin ( 140 units/kg ) plus placebo .</detailed_description>
