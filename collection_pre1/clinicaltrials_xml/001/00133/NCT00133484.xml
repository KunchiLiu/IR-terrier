If systolic blood pressure exceed 150 diastolic blood pressure exceed 90 , volunteer ask return another day repeat test . If , repeat , either value elevate , volunteer exclude , counsel appropriate health habit combat hypertension , counsel see doctor . Body Mass Index 35 18 , measure weight correct height ( weight kg/ [ height meter ] square ) weight le 110 lb . Other physical finding opinion investigator would jeopardize safety subject evaluation study objectives 4 . A current psychiatric condition , include schizophrenia , personality , anxiety , affective disorder , opinion investigator compromise subject 's ability participate trial 5 . Known hypersensitivity component one vaccine , include kanamycin ( may find trace amount rPA [ V ] ) aminoglycoside antibiotic , aluminum hydroxide ( find anthrax vaccine ) , form aldehyde ( AVA ) , benzethonium chloride ( AVA ) . 6 .
