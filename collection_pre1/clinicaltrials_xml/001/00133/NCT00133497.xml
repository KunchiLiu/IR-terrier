	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase II study ass safety efficacy cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B ( gB ) /MF59 vaccine prevent systemic cytomegalovirus infection ( CMV ) healthy adolescent female . The study intervention include : intramuscular ( IM ) injection investigational vaccine , CMV gB ) /microfluidized adjuvant 59 ( MF59 ) , deliver 20 microgram 0.5 mL vaccine IM injection 0.5 mL saline placebo . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ) receive vaccine saline placebo . The primary efficacy objective ass whether injection 3 dos CMV gB/MF59 vaccine reduce acquisition systemic CMV infection healthy CMV-seronegative adolescent female . This accomplished comparing rate acquisition systemic CMV infection , define detection CMV urine blood , placebo CMV vaccine recipient begin 1 month third dose vaccine . The primary safety objective assess local systemic effect immunization adverse event ( AE ) CMV gB/MF59 vaccine administer female adolescent 0- , 1- , 6-month schedule . This assessed comparing rate specific local systemic reactogenicity event AEs vaccine placebo group . The endpoint trial systemic infection , define identification CMV urine ( chosen common site isolation CMV ) blood ( choose likely route CMV reach fetus ) . Approximately 2400 healthy female , age 12 17 year ( time initial enrollment ) recruit order obtain approximately 400 CMV-seronegative subject vaccine trial . Collection serum occur Screening , Study Day 0 , Month 6 , Month 7 every 3 month Month 7 . Collection urine occur Study Day 0 , Month 1 , Month 2 , Month 6 , Month 7 every 3 month Month 7 . Safety/reactogenicity monitor consist solicit sign symptoms self-reported memory aid day vaccination 6 follow-up day . Unsolicited symptom collect 30-day period ( ± 2 day ) vaccination follow adequate resolution stabilization . The study duration subject 31 month : 7 month study 24 month follow-up begin 1 month last injection . There 14 schedule visit . This study link DMID protocol 06-0043 .</detailed_description>
