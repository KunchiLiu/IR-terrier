	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety administer combination vaccine ( DTaP-HepB-IPV ; Pediarix™ ) infant birth , 2 6 month compare administration HepB vaccine birth combination vaccine 2 , 4 , 6 month age . Additionally , researcher assess body 's antibody response ( protein produce body 's immune system help fight infection ) follow vaccine dose . The study enroll 5 healthy newborn , age 0-5 day . Participants involve study related procedure 288 day , include blood sample collection 5 study visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Routine immunization birth standard hepatitis B United States ( US ) hepatitis B , polio tuberculosis ( BCG ) many country . Other vaccine routinely administer birth largely due concern relate immaturity neonatal immune system possibility reduce immune response vaccine antigen . With recent licensure US pentavalent combination vaccine ( DTaP-Hep B-IPV ; Pediarix™ ) researcher propose evaluate new immunization schedule include birth dose vaccine , effort determine adequacy neonatal immune response study vaccine antigen . The primary objective study : evaluate safety administer pentavalent combination vaccine ( DTaP-HepB-IPV ; Pediarix™ ) infant birth , two six month age compare administration hepatitis B vaccine ( Engerix-B ) birth pentavalent combination vaccine two , four six month age ; assess age specific antibody response follow vaccine dose . Five healthy newborn ; 0 5 day age , great equal 37 week gestation , great 2500 gm birth weight recruit two Southern California Kaiser Permanente medical center . Infants randomize one 2 study group : Group A receive DTaP-HepB-IPV ( Pediarix™ ) vaccine along require vaccine birth , two , six month age ; Group B receive monovalent hepatitis B vaccine ( Engerix-B ) birth , DTaP-HepB-IPV ( Pediarix™ ) vaccine vaccine two , four six month . Children evaluate post-vaccination adverse event . Blood collect immunogenicity evaluate standardized humoral immunologic assay . The main outcome measure assess immune response vaccine antigen time , antibody pertussis ( PT , FHA , PRN ) , diphtheria , tetanus , haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) , polio ( Types 1 , 2 , 3 ) hepatitis B ( HbsAg ) . The secondary outcome measure assess vaccine safety , systemic local immediate reaction .</detailed_description>
