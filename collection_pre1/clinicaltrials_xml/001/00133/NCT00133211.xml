	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation common heart arrhythmia afflict approximately 1 % Danish population . Medical antiarrhythmic treatment moderately effective risk severe side effect . The present study prospective , randomize , multicentre study compare medical antiarrhythmic drug strategy catheter base radiofrequency strategy patient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . The primary end point atrial fibrillation burden ( symptomatic asymptomatic ) judge multiple 7-day Holter monitoring 2 year follow-up .

	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation ( RFA ) Versus Antiarrhythmic Drug Treatment Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Atrial fibrillation far common heart arrhythmia even increase prevalence incidence . Approximately 10 % cardiologic hospitalization due atrial fibrillation . Several study show old patient paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation minor symptom relate arrhythmia equally well frequency control compare rhythm control strategy . However , lack difference outcome may benefit achieve sinus rhythm outbalance risk medication presently know antiarrhythmic drug together modest efficacy drug . Non-pharmacological treatment atrial fibrillation drawn increase interest last decade , especially percutaneous catheter base ablation strategy focus promise result symptomatic level several series patient . Different technology use comparative study . Most important , study publish far consecutive series patient atrial fibrillation randomize either pharmacological ablative strategy . Also important majority study single-centre base prone multitude potential selection bias . Hypothesis : Pulmonary vein isolation transvenous radiofrequency ablation superior present time antiarrhythmic drug therapy regard long-term suppression atrial fibrillation ( symptomatic asymptomatic ) well procedure/treatment related side effect . Purpose : The present study design test whether catheter base radiofrequency ablation superior optimize antiarrhythmic medical therapy suppress long-term relapse symptomatic and/or asymptomatic atrial fibrillation patient already chronic pharmaceutical antiarrhythmic therapy . Secondary end point : mortality , thromboembolic event , hospitalization due disturbance heart rhythm , proarrhythmic event , procedure/treatment related side effect , health economics quality life . Comparison make two year follow-up register follow-up take place additional 3 year ( total least five year follow-up ) . Consecutive patient fulfil inclusion criterion inform study study-responsible electrophysiologist his/her substitute . After informed consent patient randomize either antiarrhythmic drug treatment catheter ablation . All patient undergo transthoracic echocardiography randomization . A register patient inform ( i.e . fulfil inclusion criterion ) one reason include study establish . Primary endpoint : Atrial fibrillation burden ( see ) , symptomatic asymptomatic combine . Atrial fibrillation burden calculate one-week Holter monitoring 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month , respectively , treatment ( first RF-procedure AAD-initiation ) . Secondary endpoint : - Mortality - Complications ( include thromboembolic event , major bleed episode , pro-arrhythmic event , treatment related side effect ) - QOL - Health economics ( include number DC-conversions , cardiovascular hospitalization ( type , length number antiarrhythmic drug ) ) - Chronic atrial fibrillation ( constant atrial fibrillation one-week Holter monitor 24 month follow-up , together atrial fibrillation immediately forego 8 week ) - Time first recurrence ( 3 month blank period ) - Left ventricular systolic function ( transthoracic echo )</detailed_description>
