	<detailed_description>Current smoking cessation pharmacotherapy paradigm ignore over-learned behaviour associate smoking , thus contribute relatively poor absolute efficacy pharmacotherapy . Chronic nicotine use cause adaptive change brain differ acute effect lead crave smoking stop . This key element relapse . Thus , development effective treatment involve good understand crave relapse explore interaction psychology neurobiology nicotine addiction . Bupropion , amphetamine derivative , demonstrate efficacy smoke cessation motivate smoker . Its ' mechanism action unclear may mediate extinction process . We hypothesize bupropion reduce cue-responsiveness subsequent craving current smoker consciously attempt quit cut smoking . Fifty smoker ( &gt; 10 cigarettes/day ) either sex recruit take either oral placebo bupropion 150 mg twice daily total 42 day .
