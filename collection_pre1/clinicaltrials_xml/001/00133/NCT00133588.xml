	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate new method detect flu infection . This method may allow researcher identify new protein make response infection even symptoms infection present . The goal study prevent flu monitor immune system response . The elderly chronic health problem great risk complication ( i.e. , pneumonia , bronchitis [ bacterial infection lung ] , sinusitis [ bacterial infection sinus ] ) flu . Early detection diagnosis flu decrease number people complication . Participants include healthy people age 21-40 , age 60-89 , 90 year old , live community surround 3 study site Virginia . There 5 study visit , subject participate 1 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proteomic Profiling Influenza</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The central hypothesis study immune response vaccination quantify proteomic profiling serum ( clinical fluid ) , host response different infectious agent unique 'fingerprinted ' proteomics . Using influenza virus vaccination , study proposes use mass spectrometry platform profile characterize protein serum sample obtain recipient . These sample use develop proteomic profiling system monitor vaccine response , eventually , early detection/diagnosis infection . The long-term goal approach develop tool useful reduce morbidity mortality influenza natural potential bioterrorism-related infection improve measure vaccine efficacy early diagnosis . The primary objective use surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight ( SELDI-TOF ) mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight ( MALDI-TOF ) mass spectrometry proteomic profiling tool analyze series serum sample obtain cohort young elderly subject , trivalent split-virus influenza vaccination , identify surrogate marker reflective immune response . The secondary objective use concurrent T-cell activation , cytokine assay , hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) serologic assays correlate cellular humoral response influenza vaccination protein profiling change . Comparisons protein profile data T-cell activation , cytokine assay , HI result evaluate use multiple classification algorithm , potential biomarker protein identify sequence either MALDI-TOF electrospray ionization mass spectrometer . Study Participants include healthy adult volunteer age 21-40 , age 60-89 , 90 year old , live independently community surround 3 study site Virginia . There 5 study visit , subject trial 1 month . The primary endpoint study identify surrogate marker reflective immune response correlate marker cellular humoral response ( demonstrate T-cell activation , cytokine assay , HI serologic assay ) influenza vaccination . The secondary endpoint safety . Data follow solicit local reaction ( injection site pain , bruising , redness , tenderness , induration ) solicit systemic reaction ( fever , headache , malaise , myalgia , cough , runny nose , chill , vomit , arthralgia , rash , diarrhea ) collect Day 0-Day 14 categorized none , mild , moderate , severe . Unsolicited adverse event ( include serious adverse event ) collect categorize throughout study severity , duration , relatedness vaccine .</detailed_description>
