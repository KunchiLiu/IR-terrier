	<brief_title>Prevention Pre-Term Birth Treatment Periodontal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESES Primary Hypothesis : That treatment periodontal disease pregnancy reduce rate pre-term birth 12 % 7 % . Secondary Hypothesis : That treatment periodontal disease pregnancy reduce rate : - Fetal growth restriction . - Complications pre-term birth include respiratory distress syndrome . - Periodontal disease measure 36 week gestation . Research Plan Synopsis : A randomized control trial conduct recruitment woman antenatal clinic Perth ’ major obstetric centre associate private practice . The sample enrich inviting woman history poor oral health pre-term birth . 5400 eligible woman undergo hygienist-based screening study 12-20 week gestation . 1094 woman meet criterion periodontal disease determine recent pilot study allocate random treatment control group . Those treatment group receive three one-hour hygienist-based periodontal treatment session commence 20 week gestation , follow re-examination 26 week . Re-treatment offer 5 % case treatment ineffective , ongoing maintenance remainder . Women allocate control group offer similar treatment completion pregnancy . RESEARCH PLAN Study Design : Multi-centered single-blinded randomize control trial conduct within metropolitan area Perth , Western Australia . The obstetric newborn health care provider blind periodontal treatment allocation . Inclusion Criteria : Women single pregnancy 12 20 week gestation periodontal disease define periodontal pocketing threshold 4mm 10 % site agree receive periodontal treatment eligible . The definition periodontal disease base publish literature pilot study design determine prevalence local obstetric population . Periodontal pocketing use define presence periodontal disease rather clinical loss attachment well represent microbial challenge frequently employ criterion . In pilot study , 15 % general unselected population meet criterion . Exclusion Criteria : Women ineligible : unable attend periodontal treatment ; le 16 year age ; present antenatal care 20 week gestation ; unable understand implication participation trial ; fetus know abnormality would predispose pregnancy pre-term birth may cause polyhydramnios ; multiple pregnancy ; cardiac disease would require antibiotic therapy dental treatment ; currently receive periodontal treatment ; few 20 teeth . Trial Entry : All woman plan attend antenatal clinic King Edward Memorial Hospital ( KEMH ) Perth , Western Australia provide write information trial appointment letter . Those attend public antenatal clinic proportion private practice also receive information invitation . Women exclusion criterion invite research midwife provide write informed consent undergo periodontal examination . After examination woman meet criterion periodontal disease invite member research team participate trial provide write informed consent treatment . A questionnaire administer obtain data demographic medical factor may influence oral health detail past present dental care . Women find periodontal disease ask provide consent obstetric outcome retrieve state-wide computerized data collection system encompass births Western Australia . Randomisation : Each woman allocate treatment control group sealed-envelope technique , prepare block 20 . Recruitment stratified history pre-term birth , nulliparity smoking practice . Women smoke either arm study provide write material encouraging cease smoking . Management Treatment Group : Women allocate treatment group give appointment attend Oral Health Centre Western Australia ( OHCWA ) . Management Control Group : Women allocate control group provide finding periodontal examination take dentist write information oral health care . Each woman also invite receive free dental care OHCWA commence 6 week delivery continue 16 week , describe . Dental Examination : The simple screening dental examination modify WHO CPITN ( Gjermo,1998 ) conduct well-equipped dental room within antenatal clinic KEMH . This examination take approximately 20 minute conduct study hygienist supervision study periodontist . If periodontitis detect woman invite participate trial describe previously . Periodontal Treatment : Treatment Group : All periodontal treatment conduct Oral Health Centre Western Australia ( OHCWA ) , locate 2 km KEMH . A full periodontal examination first perform use constant force automate Florida probe ( Florida Probe Corporation , Gainesville , Florida , USA ) provide precise measurement pocket depth 0.2mm , store data directly computer . This measurement system use pilot study two separate probe computer system available trial . Further periodontal parameter record , include clinical attachment loss , full mouth bleed probing , modify O ’ Leary Plaque Index . Treatment explanation provide hygienist consent confirm . The treatment plan woman determine consultation study periodontist conduct 3 visit one hour duration . These treatment consist non-surgical debridement sub- supra-gingival plaque , removal local predisposing factor calculus , adjustment overhang restoration . Comprehensive oral hygiene instruction motivation provide visit require . This oral hygiene advice recommend tooth brush floss every meal rinse 0.12 % non-alcohol base chlorhexidine mouth wash . These treatment provide 3 occasion weekly interval commence 20 week gestation . Local anaesthesia employ require ( 1 % lignocaine 1:80,000 adrenalin maximum dose 10mls ) . Four week final treatment , approximately 28 week gestation , visit make re-evaluate periodontal status use clinical examination Florida probe . This examination provide quantifiable assessment success treatment . Those woman treatment unsuccessful offer 3-visit treatment plan estimate require 5-10 % sample . A two visit , 45 minute duration schedule 32 36 week gestation , time periodontal supportive care oral hygiene instruction motivation carry require . Periodontal parameter visit record . Full infection control barrier technique employ stringent . Procedures include gown , disposable glove mask , eye protection examiner patient , barrier method avoid contamination . Systemic antibiotic treatment employ except case evidence multiple periodontal abscess , impair immune response poorly control diabetes . In case treatment involve oral metronidazole amoxycillin standard dose 5 day commence treatment . In pilot study observe case meet criterion . Control Group : Women allocate control group offer periodontal care birth commence 6 week delivery . This care involve initial assessment 3-visit treatment protocol woman treatment group . A full periodontal examination conduct 4 week later . After completion involvement study , woman group offer ongoing maintenance care OCHWA care free charge hold health care card . Women Who Deliver Pre-Term : Those woman deliver pre-term offer screen examination OHCWA treatment control group . Information regard provide time recruitment . Obstetric Management : The obstetric midwifery health care provider unaware treatment allocation woman study . Care provide accord standard protocol employ within hospital . Sample Size : The sample enrich advertise general medium peripheral public hospital woman poor oral health history pre-term birth attend KEMH single visit 12 20 week gestation periodontal examination . A sample size 540 woman arm provide power detect reduction rate pre-term birth 12 % 7 % power 90 % alpha level 5 % . Our pilot study 272 woman reveal rate periodontal disease 15 % unselected woman . With enrichment advertising woman high risk , estimate rate periodontal disease 20 % . Thus , total study size 1080 woman , 5400 need screen , rate 45 week 48 week work year . This sample size estimate allow two interim analysis . Statistical Considerations : A data monitoring committee form include independent statistician conduct interim analysis . The committee cease trial pre-determined rate benefit harm achieve . Analyses conduct intention-to-treat basis use test proportion logistic regression allow multiple adjustment covariates . Secondary analysis conduct dose-response treatment appropriate comparison make woman receive periodontal examination meet eligibility criterion . All hypothesis test two side significance 5 % level .</detailed_description>
