	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis affect 7 million patient cause approximately 50 % death United States . A reduction modifiable risk factor ( especially smoke , hypertension hypercholesterolemia ) associate 30 % reduction acute coronary event . Clinically , few 25 % patient achieve degree risk reduction significant barrier implementation effective risk reduction program wide variance management hypercholesterolemia . Recognition physician-directed case management system utilize certify registered nurse practitioner ( CRNP ) computer-based decision support technology ( CDST ) offer potential implement disease management guideline consistently effectively impetus project . This project demonstrate enhance compliance National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) guideline achieve randomized trial conduct subject enrol general medical clinic . The way hyperlipidemia manage determine randomization PCP provider either usual care group intervention group , management subject delegate CRNP conjunction CDST , supervision physician- investigator . Approximately 220 hypercholesterolemic subject eligible risk reduction accord NCEP guideline recruit equal number subject enrol primary care clinic , begin 2005 . The physician-directed case management system employ project utilizes management algorithm lower LDL-C cholesterol goal le 70 mg % . Stepwise increase simvastatin dose maximum 80 mg/day use . Surveillance symptom laboratory data detect adverse side effect intervention precedes increase simvastatin dose . The CRNP implement management algorithm concentrate subject adherence , judge important element promote compliance . The CRNP initiate contact subject whenever decision point reach treatment algorithm , deviation management algorithm occur adverse reaction detect . The case management model show effective achieve treatment goal condition hypercholesterolemia diabetes mellitus . This study test hypothesis I , employ physician-directed case management system , utilize Certified Registered Nurse Practitioner ( CRNP ) conjunction computer-based decision support technology ( CDST ) result significantly low total cholesterol lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol group subject enrol general medical clinic compare subject manage primary care provider usual care group . A secondary aim project establish computer-based decision support technology develop provide reliable clinical recommendation management type II hyperlipidemia . This proposition test hypothesis II , computer-based decision technology provide advice management hyperlipidemia comparable cardiologist institution . Our physician-directed case-management system expect enhance guideline compliance CDST monitoring subject�s compliance cholesterol response management algorithm , thus contribute improve outcomes patient .</detailed_description>
