	<brief_title>Drug-eluting-stents Unprotected Left Main Stem Disease ( ISAR-LEFT-MAIN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With advent coronary stent improvement periprocedural antithrombotic regimen , spectrum indication percutaneous coronary intervention continuously expand patient coronary heart disease , gain ground traditionally consider domain coronary bypass surgery . Several group report outcomes patient unprotected leave main coronary artery ( LMCA ) disease treat stenting . Most found LMCA stenting feasible safe , , low-risk patient , associate minimal periprocedural complication low long-term morbidity mortality . Despite encouraging report , widespread use technique hamper still high incidence restenosis . It commonly accept coronary bypass graft surgery stenting unprotected LMCA disease associate similar rate mortality , high incidence restenosis great need revascularization procedure LMCA stenting remain major contributor observe difference clinical efficacy therapy . The recent introduction stent elute anti-restenotic drug , sirolimus paclitaxel study compound , open new perspective prevention restenosis . Several randomized trial report excellent result reduction restenosis need reinterventions drug-eluting stent ( DES ) . Although , none trial study benefit DES lesion locate LMCA , result suggest use new device may particularly helpful reduction restenosis group patient leave main trunk disease . This supported finding several series patient unprotected LMCA disease successfully treat DES . Importantly , patient unable undergo CABG due cardiac surgeon ' refusal ( poor surgical candidate ) unwillingness , stenting DES remain revascularization alternative . Recent guideline PCI recommend stenting , preferentially DES , unprotected LMCA absence revascularization option . Comparison : Sirolimus-eluting stent compare paclitaxel-eluting stent treatment lesion allocate leave main trunk .</detailed_description>
