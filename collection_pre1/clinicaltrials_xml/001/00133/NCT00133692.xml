	<brief_summary>Because blood pressure affect heart , blood vessel , kidney , entire body , important keep normal possible . There several different way control blood pressure prevent limit development heart disease due high blood pressure . The purpose study compare two treatment see well work difference side effect . One treatment include use calcium antagonist drug ( Isoptin sustain release [ SR ] Verapamil SR ) . The treatment exclude calcium antagonist may include non-calcium antagonist drug call beta blocker ( Tenormin Atenolol ) . Both treatment may also include medication call angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor water pill . None drug study experimental , approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INVEST investigator initiate international , prospective , randomize study compare two pharmacotherapy strategy control hypertension ambulatory patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . One strategy , calcium antagonist care strategy , center calcium antagonist ( verapamil SR ) follow addition ACE inhibitor ( trandolapril ) diuretic ( hydrochlorothiazide ) need achieve target blood pressure ( BP ) . The strategy , non-calcium antagonist care strategy , use beta-blocker ( atenolol ) follow addition low-dose diuretic ACE inhibitor ( trandolapril ) need reach target BP . In either strategy additional drug add provided calcium antagonist retain calcium antagonist care strategy calcium antagonist omit non-calcium antagonist care strategy . The study organize 15 international region 1,500 study investigator randomize approximately 22,000 patient treat least two year . The primary response variable occurrence adverse outcome , define follow event : cause mortality , nonfatal MI nonfatal stroke . A number secondary response variable , include newly diagnose diabetes also evaluate . The primary objective trial examine hypothesis risk adverse outcome ( cause mortality , nonfatal MI nonfatal stroke ) hypertensive patient CAD least equivalent treatment hypertension calcium antagonist strategy compare non-calcium antagonist strategy . Unique feature INVEST , addition size international scope , design mimic standard clinical practice electronic online data entry , drug distribution system , study management system , electronic physician compensation . This system permit entire trial conduct via Internet . This design believe forerunner clinical trial research future .</detailed_description>
