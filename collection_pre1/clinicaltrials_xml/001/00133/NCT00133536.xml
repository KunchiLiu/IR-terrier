	<brief_summary>The purpose study : make sure serious side effect experimental inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine child ; see body 's immune system react vaccine . To look side effect , researcher follow child closely vaccination . To look immune system response , researcher test child 's blood number time vaccination . Participants include 130 healthy child age 2-9 year . Participants assign receive 2 , 3 dos vaccine , placebo ( inactive substance ) . Subjects receive least 2 dos vaccine approximately 28 day apart . If data show enhance immune response third vaccination , child offer third dose vaccine . Participants involve study related procedure 13 month , include 6 study visit , plus number telephone call .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A/H5N1 Vaccine Healthy Children Aged 2-9 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study assess safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity 45-microgram dosage level monovalent subvirion influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine administer intramuscular ( IM ) route healthy child . The primary goal study determine dosage level H5N1 result acceptable proportion child achieve potentially protective post vaccination antibody titer ( provisionally assign serum neutralize titer 1:40 , base study conduct Hong Kong 1997 H5N1 outbreak ) . Approximately 130 healthy child , age 2 9 year , enrol multicenter , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , clinical trial receive least 2 3 dos inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine 45-microgram dose . One hundred subject enrol randomly assign influenza A/H5N1 vaccine dose group 20 subject placebo group ( 5:1 ratio ) . Subjects stratify 2 age group ( 2 5 year old 6 9 year old ) . Vaccine placebo administer deltoid . Subjects randomize receive vaccine receive 2 dos vaccine approximately 28 day apart . At approximately month 5 , subject ' parent ( ) guardian ( ) call remind 6-month follow-up visit . At 6-month visit , subject assess serious adverse event ( SAEs ) randomization assignment , ie , vaccine placebo , unmasked subject parent ( ) guardian ( ) . Should data evaluate third dose influenza A/H5N1 vaccine adult show enhanced immunogenicity , parent guardian subject receive vaccine offer third dose , additional blood draw immediately prior third dose 28 day 6 month thereafter . The 6-month post-Dose 3 blood draw optional . For subject assign placebo , parent guardian offer opportunity enroll subject separate open-label protocol 2 dose regimen administer vaccine recipient find safe immunogenic . The primary endpoint study include : adverse event ( AE ) SAE information ( solicit in-clinic via memory aid , concomitant medication , periodic target physical assessment , indicate ) ; proportion subject achieve serum neutralize antibody titer 1:40 influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ( approximately Day 56 ) ; geometric mean titer ( GMT ) frequency 4-fold great increase hemagglutination inhibition neutralize antibody titer 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ( approximately Day 56 ) . The secondary endpoint study include : proportion subject achieve serum neutralize antibody titer 1:40 influenza A/H5N1 virus 1 6 month receipt first third dos ( third dose administered [ see study design ] ) vaccine ; GMT frequency 4-fold great increase serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer 1 6 month receipt first third ( third dose administered [ see study design ] ) dose vaccine ; development serum antibody responses antigenically drifted variant influenza H5N1 virus . This study link protocol 06-0072 .</detailed_description>
