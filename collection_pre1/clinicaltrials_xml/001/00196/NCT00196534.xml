	<criteria>Male female patient , race , 18 year old . Patients least one bleed site within operative field mild ( ooze capillary bleeding ) moderate ( gradual steady bleeding ) intensity manage surgical modality ineffective impractical ( Change 15 , Amend 1 ) . Patients schedule follow elective surgical procedure : 1 . Cardiovascular Procedures aortic surgery aneurysmectomy , aneurysmoplasty , aneurysmorrhaphy , aneurysmotomy bypass procedure involve aorta ; major coronary bypass procedure include primary bypass surgery redo procedure . Peripheral vascular procedure include femoralpopliteal bypass , femoralfemoral bypass , peripheral vascular procedure require vessel graft native prosthetic graft include Polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) graft ; carotid endarterectomy . The sternum exclude Target Site . Bleeding sit evaluated procedure may include soft tissue ( e.g . mammary bed , retroperitoneal fat/connective tissue adhesion ) needle hole bleeding prosthetic graft material ( Change 6 , Amend 1 ) . 2 . Neurosurgical ( spine ) Procedures primary lumbar laminectomy laminectomy fusion ( fusion must do time hemostasis assessment ) . Redo laminectomy , removal tumors/lesions laminectomy , cervical , thoracic laminectomy procedure exclude . Bleeding site evaluate may include periosteum , bone marrow , venous plexus ( Change 7 , Amend 1 ) . 3 . General Surgery PostTraumatic ( hemodynamically stable noncoagulopathic ) procedure : bowel colon resection , retroperitoneal dissections/resections , procedure involve resection solid abdominal organ splenectomy , liver resection , nephrectomy , splenorrhaphy , pancreatectomy . Bleeding site evaluate may include soft tissue ( e.g . bowel mesentery , adhesion , lymph node bed , sacral venous plexus , etc . ) parenchymal organ bleeds ( cut surface resect liver , spleen , etc. , exclude cut surface kidney ) ( Amendment # 2 , Change 44 ) .
