It also design help men clarify value use computer-based 'decision aid . ' A decision aid give patient tool help understand value value may relate choice different form therapy prostate cancer . In order test effectiveness decision aid , men assign chance basis receive either 1 ) computer program include information prostate cancer treatment alone , 2 ) computer program contain information decision aid .

	<detailed_description>Background : There controversy medical community surround utility treatment option clinically localized prostate cancer . Although several option available management localized prostate cancer , option clearly superior others . The main therapeutic option localize prostate cancer include radical prostatectomy ( RP ) , radiation therapy ( RT ; external beam radiation brachytherapy ) , expectant management ( EM ) `` watchful waiting . '' The American Urological Association , structure review available literature , conclude insufficient evidence clearly recommend RP , RT , EM . They recommend factor life expectancy , current health , patient preference therapeutic option consider treatment decision . Since survival benefit different management strategy yet uncertain , men 's preference outcomes therapy may influence decision regard management choice , men inform potential outcome encourage examine value decide upon management strategy prostate cancer . Objective : The primary goal evaluate method patient education design provide treatment-related information help men clarify preference value via recently develop computer-based decision aid . We expect men randomize decision aid condition active treatment decision improve patient outcomes relative men assign Information condition . Specific Aims . The specific aim : 1 ) To evaluate relative impact provide newly diagnose patient computer-based prostate cancer treatment information vs. provide patient information plus interactive decision-aid ) share decision-making practice b ) patient outcome ( decisional satisfaction , quality life , knowledge ) , 2 ) To explore mechanism decision aid impact SDM patient outcome , 3 ) To identify men least likely benefit education plus decision-aid intervention . Study Design : Men accrue time biopsy positive biopsy result receive intervention follow notification diagnosis prior initial meeting urologist treatment option discuss . Participants follow one , six twelve month post-intervention . The primary outcome include patient outcome ( knowledge , quality life , decisional satisfaction ) share decision making ( SDM ) practice . Relevance In many area medicine , include treatment localized prostate cancer , rapid expansion research result grow number diagnostic treatment option available physician patient . In many case , several effective viable treatment option , randomize clinical trial assess treatment effectiveness yet complete . Although availability different option undoubtedly beneficial long run , present creates difficult decision individual physician face choice best answer know . The propose study design assist patient decision , provide information help consider value .</detailed_description>
