	<detailed_description>Title study : Ibandronate without Capecitabine Elderly Patients Early Breast Cancer - ( ICE Study ) Rationale : Approximately 50 % new diagnosis early breast cancer make patient age 65 . As age group eligible trial past , effect adjuvant therapy still unclear elderly patient . The primary aim trial determine role adjuvant chemotherapy capecitabine elderly patient . The high activity , acceptable toxicity oral formulation compound especially meet requirement elderly patient . Bisphosphonates establish effectivity treatment prevention osteoporosis . Furthermore , two study recently show adjuvant long term use clodronate reduce risk recurrence breast cancer . The third generation bisphosphonate ibandronate give trial patient prevent osteoporosis recurrence breast cancer , condition patient risk . As preference elderly patient intravenous oral application know , mode application ibandronate accord patient ' choice preference compliance secondary endpoint . Primary objective To compare event-free survival elderly patient local treatment primary breast cancer treat either ibandronate alone ibandronate capecitabine adjuvant treatment Secondary objective To compare overall survival two arm To determine compliance arm To determine toxicity arm To determine rate bone-related event hormone sensitive insensitive disease ( without endocrine therapy ) To determine preference oral intravenous application ibandronate To assess quality life To compare geriatric assessment Charlson versus VES 13 score Tertiary objective To determine prognostic factor tumor tissue collect primary surgery correlate study treatment effect To evaluate prognostic impact age , serum albumin , hemoglobin level , creatinine clearance , Charlson Score , VES-Score multivariate analysis prediction treatment associate adverse event limited life time expectancy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent prior begin specific protocol procedure , include expect cooperation patient treatment followup , must obtain document accord local regulatory requirement . 2 . Histologically confirm unilateral bilateral primary carcinoma breast . 3 . Age diagnosis ≥ 65 year 4 . Adequately surgical treatment complete resection ( Ro ) tumor &gt; = 10 axillary node . Sole sentinel node biopsy allow sentinel node show tumor involvement . 5 . Node positive disease irrespective additional risk factor node negative disease least one risk factor ( histologic tumor size &gt; = 2 cm , grade II III , ER PR negative ) 6 . No evidence distant metastasis complete diagnostic work 7 . Performance Status ECOG &lt; = 2 8 . Charlson Scale &lt; = 2 9 . Estimated life expectancy least 5 year ( irrespective breast cancer diagnosis ) 10 . The patient must accessible treatment followup . 1 . Known hypersensitivity reaction compound incorporated substance know dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency . 2 . Inadequate organ function include : Leucocytes &lt; 3,5 G/l , Platelets &lt; 100 G/l , Bilirubin 1.25 time normal limit , Creatinine clearance calculate CockroftGold formula 50 ml/min , uncompensated cardiac function , severe relevant comorbidity would interact application cytotoxic agent participation study 3 . Another primary malignancy eventfree survival &lt; 5 year , except curatively treat basalioma skin 4 . Time since axillary dissection &gt; 3 month 5 . Locally advanced , nonoperable breast cancer 6 . Previous invasive breast carcinoma 7 . Previous treatment cytotoxic agent reason 8 . Concurrent treatment hormonal replacement therapy ( treatment stop enter trial ) . 9 . Previous treatment bisphosphonates osteoporosis allow , however treatment substituted trial medication 10 . Concurrent specific systemic antitumor treatment treatment experimental compound within last 6 month 11 . Concurrent treatment tumor specific experimental drug . Participation another clinical trial investigational market drug within 30 day prior study entry . 12 . Concurrent treatment virostatic agent like brivudine analoga sorivudine , concurrent treatment aminoglycosides 13 . Male patient</criteria>
