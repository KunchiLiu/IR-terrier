The target population educational intervention men register undergo PCa screening within free , mass screen program . Although first may appear atypical group target educational intervention , present information suggest population represent large uniformed group effective inexpensive method education critical importance . We test impact provide men detail information decision aid vs. usual care information impact time administration information ( week prior screen vs. usual care , day screen ) . Participants include men register annual PCa mass screen program hold Georgetown University Howard University 2004 2005 screen program .

Follow-up assessment conduct post-screening , post receipt screen result , one-year post-intervention , measure knowledge , decisional conflict , decisional satisfaction , actual screening decision . We utilize 2 ( IDA/UC ) X 2 ( Home/Clinic ) X 2 ( AA/white ) repeat measure analysis covariance ass group difference outcomes . If find effective , long-term goal research program disseminate informational decision aid use mass screen program .</detailed_description>
