	<brief_summary>Males female may exhibit different response test adrenal function . The hormone responsible control adrenal function ACTH ( adrenocorticotropic hormone corticotropin ) CRH ( corticotropin-releasing hormone ) . Adrenal function test ACTH stimulation test . ACTH stimulate adrenal gland produce cortisol . Cortisol level measure , certain peak level indicate normal adrenal gland function . Females may produce cortisol response ACTH testing male . This difference may due certain protein , call G protein . The hormone control adrenal function , ACTH CRH , work G proteins . Females may G protein male allow increase cortisol response ACTH stimulation . We speculate : 1 . There may difference adrenal responsiveness ACTH stimulation test healthy male female . 2 . ACTH CRH induce function . 3 . Sex difference adrenal responsiveness ACTH stimulation test may relate sex difference G protein expression . In study , cortisol , hormone produce adrenal gland , measure administration ACTH . This study also measure G proteins . G proteins find white blood cell . White blood cell female may active G proteins white blood cell male . Sex difference may augment exposure ACTH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many nonsteroidal hormone work G protein signal transducer . These heterotrimeric signal transducer couple cell surface receptor intracellular pathway , thus convey biologic effect . Most hormones work via stimulatory G protein , Gas , also exert action homologous stimulatory G protein , Gaq , suggest pathway exhibit redundancy . We previously demonstrate sex difference expression Gas Gaq . We observe female mouse human display significantly high level mRNA protein G protein , Gaq . We also observe estrogen induce expression Gaq mRNA protein female mouse . In addition , preliminary study mice demonstrate ACTH ( adrenocorticotropic hormone corticotropin ) CRH ( corticotropin-releasing hormone ) induce GÔÅ°q immune cell adrenal tissue sex restrict fashion , i.e . female . ACTH CRH two major hormone control adrenal function . Adrenal function test use standard 1mcg synthetic ACTH stimulation test measure production cortisol . We observe female exhibit trend toward increased responsiveness ACTH stimulation male . We speculate sex difference cortisol responsiveness ACTH exist , difference correlate sex difference expression induction G proteins , Gaq Gas . We propose determine whether healthy female subject undergo low-dose ACTH stimulation exhibit altered level Gaq Gas mRNA protein cortisol level compare male subject undergo provocative testing . This study may implications interpretation provocative ACTH testing .</detailed_description>
