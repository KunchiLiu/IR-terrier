	<brief_summary>- Aphasia , loss impairment language cause brain damage , one devastate cognitive impairment stroke . Aphasia treat combination speech-language therapy drug . Conventional speech-language therapy chronic aphasic subject little help several drug study limited success . Therefore therapeutic strategy warrant . - Recent data suggest drug ( memantine ) act brain chemical glutamate may help recovery cognitive deficit , include language , subject vascular dementia . The present study examines safety profile efficacy memantine pair intensive language therapy subject stroke-related chronic aphasia ( 1 yr. evolution ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Memantine Constraint-Induced Language Therapy Chronic Poststroke Aphasia : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The efficacy drug act glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist memantine require explored population . The rationale use memantine post-stroke aphasia come recent study vascular dementia . Data extract recent Cochrane review randomize controlled trial memantine different type dementia ( vascular dementia , Alzheimer 's disease , mixed dementia ) reveal , 6 week treatment , beneficial effect cognition ( include language ) , activity daily live , behavior global scale well global impression change . - Recovery aphasia possible even severe case . While speech-language therapy remain mainstay treatment aphasia , effectiveness conclusively prove . This motivate plan rational therapy ( e.g. , constraint-induced language therapy [ Pulverm√ºller et al. , 2001 ; 32 : 1621-1626 ] ) . - In addition , neural correlate improvement language function readily detectable event-related potential . This noninvasive technique detect real time functional brain change recovery promote combined action memantine constraint-induced language therapy . - The aim present study ass efficacy , safety profile , functional correlate memantine pair massed language therapy sample patient chronic poststroke aphasia .</detailed_description>
