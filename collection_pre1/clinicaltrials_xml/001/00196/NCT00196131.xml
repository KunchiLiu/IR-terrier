	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : During severe brain trauma ( injury , surgery ) ensue inflammatory response central nervous system ( CNS ) result decrease expression transporter protein p-glycoprotein ( PGP ) blood brain barrier . This loss result penetration brain certain drug normally exclude transporter protein . In study work hypothesis agitation observe patient CNS trauma treat morphine relate inflammation evoke loss PGP blood brain barrier accumulation morphine metabolite 3-morphine glucuronide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well establish metabolism , distribution elimination certain drug affect inflammatory process . This result expression cytochrome drug transporter protein alter generation host defense mechanism . This major implication inflammation infection capacity liver organs handle drug severely compromise . From study animal individual cytochrome P450 isozymes p-glycoprotein ( PGP ) regulate level gene transcription result decrease correspond mRNA , protein enzyme/transporter activity . The loss drug metabolism transport channel predominantly production cytokine ultimately modify specific transcription factor . Other propose mechanism apply specific cytochrome P450s involve post translational step include enzyme modification increase degradation . When inflammatory response confine brain loss cytochrome P450 PGP brain also peripheral tissue . This involve yet identify mode signal brain periphery involve production cytokine peripheral source . In clinical medicine numerous example decrease capacity handle drug infection disease state involve inflammatory component . This often result alter drug response increase toxicity . Inflammation mediate alteration metabolism endogenous compound also lead altered physiology . Recently show rodent inflammatory response within brain alter drug disposition brain peripheral system . Of particular note use drug patient brain trauma recent study laboratory carry rodent show transport drug across blood brain barrier dramatically change CNS inflammatory response . The reason occur loss expression drug transporter protein ( PGP ) . This allow drug normally transport brain PGP enter cause CNS toxicity . Such change drug handle capacity inflammation/infection continue one many factor complicate therapeutic . In human severe CNS trauma ( injury , surgery ) inflammatory response commonly occur within brain . It also clinical observation patient receive morphine part care drug tolerate day many patient develop agitation believe relate morphine therapy . Our work hypothesis metabolite morphine CNS irritant ( 3-morphine glucuronide ) enter brain increase amount inflammation evoke loss transporter protein PGP blood brain barrier . In normal circumstance morphine metabolize liver two major metabolite ( 3-morphine glucuronide 6-morphine glucuronide ) . These metabolite exclude extent function PGP blood brain barrier . If PGP diminishes blood brain barrier result CNS inflammation morphine metabolites increase concentration brain . Some support idea take recent study show inhibition PGP chemical mean increase concentration 6-glucuronide morphine follow administration morphine rat . Although 6-glucuronide potent morphine similar action , 3-glucuronide CNS irritant may cause agitation observed patient . We propose measure metabolites side blood brain barrier patient CNS trauma/inflammation determine agitation correlate build metabolite . If demonstrate metabolite increase CNS result inflammation study far reach consequence many drug normally exclude brain manner ( eg digoxin , cyclosporine A , HIV protease inhibitor ) use condition involve inflammatory component CNS .</detailed_description>
