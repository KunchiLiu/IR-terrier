	<brief_summary>This study conduct patient differentiate thyroid cancer undergone near-total thyroidectomy . After surgery patient randomize one two method perform thyroid remnant ablation ( use radioiodine remove remain thyroid tissue ) . One group patient take thyroid hormone medicine euthyroid [ i.e . thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) level normal ] , receive injection Thyrogen ( 0.9 mg daily two consecutive day ) follow oral radioiodine . The second group patient take thyroid hormone medicine hypothyroid ( i.e . TSH level high ) , give oral radioiodine . All patient receive amount radioactive iodine ( 100 mCi 3.7 GBq 131I ) . Approximately 8 month later , whole body scan perform patient learn whether thyroid remnant successfully ablate . The safety profile Thyrogen use radioiodine remnant ablation also assess . The Quality Life , radioiodine uptake retention thyroid bed , well radiation exposure remainder body also assess group patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Safety Successful Ablation Thyroid Remnant Post-thyroidectomized Euthyroid Patients ( i.e . Patients Administered Thyrogen ) Versus Hypothyroid Patients ( Thyrogen ) Following 131I Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following total/near-total thyroidectomy , eligible patient provide write informed consent within 14 day post-surgery . Patients randomize 1 2 group : Euthyroid Hypothyroid group . Once randomize , patient Euthyroid group receive thyroid hormone suppression therapy ( THST ) 4 week . At end fourth week , patient 's TSH level measure . If TSH level &lt; 5 mU/L , Thyrogen ( 0.9 mg ) administer intramuscularly ( IM ) daily ( qd ) 2 day . Twenty-four hour follow second dose Thyrogen , ablative activity 131I ( 100 mCi ; 3.7 GBq ) administer . All patient underwent post-treatment whole-body scanning ( WBS ) remnant-neck image 48 hour , 72 96 hour , 96 168 hour ( preferably 120 hour ) follow ablation . In addition , study allow option perform scan 24 hour 144 168 hour ablation . Following final post-treatment scan , patient Euthyroid group continue THST . Patients randomized Hypothyroid Group receive THST randomization . These individual monitor least 4 week TSH &gt; 25 mU/L . Patients give ablative dose 131I ( 100 mCi , 3.7 GBq ) . If patient 's TSH &lt; 25 mU/L end fourth week , patient 's TSH measure 1 week later . Patients underwent post-treatment WBS remnant-neck image 48 hour , 72 96 hour , 96 168 hour ( preferably 120 hour ) follow ablation . In addition , study allow option perform scan 24 hour 144 168 hour post ablation . Following final post-treatment scan , patient Hypothyroid group commence THST . Eight ( Â± l ) month later , patient Euthyroid Hypothyroid group receive Thyrogen ( 0.9 mg qd 2 day ) follow activity 131I ( 4 mCi ; 0.15 GBq ) , preparation 48-hour WBS remnant-neck imaging . Patients negative neck scan ( i.e . visible uptake , visible uptake , le 0.1 % uptake thyroid bed ) 8 ( + 1 ) month follow 131I treatment consider successfully ablate .</detailed_description>
