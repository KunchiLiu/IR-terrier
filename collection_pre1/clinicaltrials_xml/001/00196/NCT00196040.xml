	<brief_summary>The primary objective study demonstrate safety efficacy PFX Closure System utilized patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) patient suffer cryptogenic stroke ( undetermined cause stroke ) , transient ischemic attack ( brief neurological dysfunction ) , migraine decompression illness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Paradigm II Trial : PFX Closure System Subjects With Cryptogenic Stroke , Transient Ischemic Attack , Migraine Decompression Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patent Foramen Ovale implicate etiology paradoxical embolism , cryptogenic stroke , transient ischemic attack , right leave gas embolism severe decompression illness . An association patent foramen ovale severe migraine headache also report . Several implantable device use percutaneous closure patent foramen ovale ; propose use non-implantable system safely effect closure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject 18 65 year old Documented patent foramen ovale determine positive micro bubble study demonstrate right left shunt and/or anatomic detection functional assessment preoperative transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) perioperative echocardiography ultrasound . Subjects one following : history cryptogenic stroke , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) embolism due presume paradoxical embolism PFO ; history severe migraine headache , despite attempted treatment available migraine medication , specific cause migraine headache , underlie disease medication , rule ; history severe decompression illness . Negative pregnancy test woman childbearing potential Signed Informed Consent form Additional Inclusion Criteria Migraine Subjects : Onset migraine age 50 year History migraine &gt; 1 year Migraine frequency great 1 migraine per month Presence thrombus intend site closure , leave atrial appendage , document evidence venous thrombus vessel access PFO gain . Active endocarditis , infection produce bacteremia Presence atrial septal defect ( ) fenestration allow shunt Presence implant cardiac valve , pacemaker , cardioverters/defibrillators ( ICDs ) vena cava filter . Subjects coagulation disorder bleed disorder include gastric ulcer , unable take antiplatelet anticoagulant therapy Subjects intracardiac mass , tumor , clot vegetation Large , redundant atrial septal aneurysm would prohibit adequate device access PFO closure PFO , judgment investigator . A coexisting redundant atrial septal aneurysm consider large prohibits ability operator adequately achieve vacuum suction necessary achieve PFO closure . Presence conduction abnormality require pharmacologic electrical therapy intervention 1st degree block Current enrollment investigational trial ( ) use device implant vascular system enrol experimental drug study ( y ) within three month study entry Religious belief would prevent subject follow physician direct instruction prevent compliance protocol require medication followup . Hemodynamic instability shock History diabetes require treatment insulin Additional Exclusion Criteria Cryptogenic Stroke Subjects : History stroke TIA within past 14 day Source stroke paradoxical embolization Additional Exclusion Criteria Migraine Subjects : Seizure disorder Other organic central nervous system disease Headache result traumatic head neck injury Evidence alcohol , drug substance abuse within previous year</criteria>
