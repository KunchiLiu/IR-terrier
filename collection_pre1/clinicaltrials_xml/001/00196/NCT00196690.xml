	<brief_summary>- Aphasia ( impairment language function due brain damage ) may treat speech-language therapy drug . Several drug study limited success . - Recent data suggest neurotransmitter acetylcholine may reduce brain damage subject drug stimulates acetylcholine activity may help recovery aphasic deficit particularly pair speech-language therapy . - Recent evidence indicate medicament act neurotransmitter acetylcholine may promote improvement aphasic deficit previous open-label study donepezil post-stroke aphasia show benefit patient observed benefit long-lasting ( 6 month ) .This study test safety efficacy donepezil ( agent act acetylcholine ) subject stroke-related chronic aphasia ( 1 yr evolution ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donepezil Chronic Poststroke Aphasia : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Prior clinical information donepezil treatment post-stroke aphasia come single-case study , small case-series open-label study . In addition , extension phase small open-label study also suggest efficacy donepezil chronic post-stroke apahsia maintain long-term follow-up . These data collectively suggest post-stroke donepezil effective well-tolerated limited potential cause clinically significant interaction prescribe medication . However , result preliminary judge parsimoniously randomize control trial performed.Moreover , recent data group also show donepezil may improve sensorimotor deficit ( hemiparesis ) patient . - The use acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil post-stroke may justify vivo postmortem study show patient vascular dementia lesion subcortical cortical structure deficient cholinergic neurotransmission result interruption cholinergic pathway link basal forebrain cerebral cortex , include perisylvian language area.In addition , two large-scale randomized control trial patient pure vascular dementia vascular cognitive impairment find donepezil significantly superior placebo cognition , global function activity daily living.And noticeable benefit donepezil placebo dos 5-mg 10-mg find Alzheimer â€™ Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale ( ADAS-Cog/11 ) , assessment instrument highly reliant upon language variable ( 6 11 item ) . - We evaluate efficacy donepezil patient chronic aphasia associate stroke.This 20-week , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind parallel study enrol aphasic patient one year evolution . During study patient continue receive two hour weekly conventional speech-language therapy . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio donepezil , 5-mg/day , first 4 week , follow force dose escalation 10-mg/day thereafter ( n =13 ) , placebo ( n = 13 ) 4 week washout period . The primary efficacy measure Aphasia Quotient ( AQ ) Western Aphasia Battery Communicative Activity Log . Secondary efficacy measure include select subtests Psycholinguistic Assessment Language Processing Aphasia examine phonological lexical-semantic domain Stroke Aphasia Depression Questionnaire .</detailed_description>
