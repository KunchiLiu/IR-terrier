	<detailed_description>This randomize study compare two energy source catheter base ablation typical isthmus-dependent atrial flutter : The ( standard ) radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation technique cryo-ablation technique . The RF ablation typical atrial flutter become standard approach high cure rate low complication incidence . However , ablation RF painful since underlie cardiac tissue heat ( 70-80°C inside tissue ) especially target ablation typical atrial flutter , so-called cavo-tricuspid isthmus , pain-receptive area . Cryo-ablation , destroy tissue freeze -80 -90°C , think less painful even painless efficacy RF ablation . The acute long term ( 6 month follow-up , non-invasive ) efficacy safety combine endpoint .</detailed_description>
