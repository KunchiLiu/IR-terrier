	<brief_summary>In recent AGO-study , dose-dense dose-intensified sequence Epirubicin - Paclitaxel - Cyclophosphamide show superior efficacy compare conventionally dose sequence Epirubicin / Cyclophosphamid Paclitaxel therefore choose standard treatment study . The experimental arm EC-TX combine several strategy : combination EC administer every 2 week dose-dense regimen , combination TX also consider dose-dense due weekly application paclitaxel . Furthermore clinical evidence , combination capecitabine Paclitaxel provide synergistic effect improve tumour response . A randomized phase III study could demonstrate survival benefit combination capecitabine Docetaxel patient metastatic breast cancer . This synergistic effect probably base preclinical observe taxane-mediated up-regulation thymidine phosphorylase tumour cell , give drive increase transformation capecitabine active form 5-Fluorouracil . Apart synergy , EC-TX regimen include 4 highly active compound treatment breast cancer . The total dos Epirubicin Paclitaxel identical arm . The dosage Cyclophosphamide low experimental arm , prefer due induction leukaemia high dos Cyclophosphamide . The duration arm 18 20 week nearly similar . The 2 2 factorial design trial provide additional possibility explore efficacy bisphosphonate another strategy improve prognosis node positive breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare ETC vs. EC-TX Ibandronate v . Observation Patients With Node-positive Primary Breast Cancer ( GAIN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently several strategy investigation improve adjuvant treatment early node-positive breast cancer . These combination treatment drug synergistic mode action , dose-dense application cytotoxic drug , dose-intensification use new , non-cytotoxic approach . In recent AGO-study , dose-dense dose-intensified sequence Epirubicin - Paclitaxel - Cyclophosphamide show superior efficacy compare conventionally dose sequence Epirubicin / Cyclophosphamid Paclitaxel therefore choose standard treatment study . The experimental arm EC-TX combine several mentioned strategy : combination EC administer every 2 week dose-dense regimen , combination TX also consider dose-dense due weekly application paclitaxel . Furthermore clinical evidence , combination capecitabine Paclitaxel provide synergistic effect improve tumour response . A randomized phase III study could demonstrate survival benefit combination capecitabine Docetaxel patient metastatic breast cancer . This synergistic effect probably base preclinical observe taxane-mediated up-regulation thymidine phosphorylase tumour cell , give drive increase transformation capecitabine active form 5-Fluorouracil . Apart synergy , EC-TX regimen include 4 highly active compound treatment breast cancer . The total dos Epirubicin Paclitaxel identical arm . The dosage Cyclophosphamide low experimental arm , prefer due induction leukaemia high dos Cyclophosphamide . The duration arm 18 20 week nearly similar . The 2 2 factorial design trial provide additional possibility explore efficacy bisphosphonate another strategy improve prognosis node positive breast cancer . As mechanism action cytotoxic drug bisphosphonates appear independent factorial design adequate statistical model trial . Up limited information available potential role bisphosphonates set generate use 1st generation bisphosphonate Clodronate . 3rd generation bisphosphonates like ibandronate much active , less toxic application convenient ( high importance regard long duration treatment ) . Primary aim trial improve disease-free survival use EC-TX regimen use ibandronate adjuvant treatment 2 year .</detailed_description>
