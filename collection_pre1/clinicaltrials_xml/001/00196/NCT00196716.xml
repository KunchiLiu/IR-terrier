	<brief_summary>People Fabry disease alteration genetic material ( DNA ) cause deficiency alpha-galactosidase A enzyme . This enzyme help break remove certain type fatty substance call `` glycolipids . '' These glycolipids normally present within body cell . In people Fabry disease , glycolipids build various tissue liver , kidney , skin , blood vessel alpha-galactosidase A present , present small quantity . The build glycolipid level ( also refer `` globotriaosylceramide '' `` GL-3 '' ) tissue think cause clinical symptom common Fabry disease . Symptoms commonly appear childhood pain hand foot . This trial design evaluate efficacy lower dose Fabrazyme patient initially receive 1.0 mg/kg every 2 week Fabrazyme investigate achieve clearance glycosphingolipid deposit vascular endothelium kidney maintain low dose .</brief_summary>
