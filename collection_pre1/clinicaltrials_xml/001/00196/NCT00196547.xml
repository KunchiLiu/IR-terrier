	<brief_title>Montelukast Modulating Exacerbations Asthma Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between 1990- 2003 , identify Ontario , subsequently across Canada , strike increase hospital admission asthma child occur predictably third week September every year.1 In 2000 undertook retrospective case-control study compare clinical characteristic child use local emergency room asthma September , child present non-epidemic month July-August . Based pilot study 169 child , develop large prospective case-control study clinical biological characteristic child recruit presented emergency room asthma September 2001 . The control group study child recruit community symptomatic asthma September exacerbation require emergency room utilization . We identify presence rhinovirus majority child attend ER acute asthma , also find rhinovirus substantial proportion community base control . We also find highly significant difference use medication asthma , ER case much less likely receive adequate anti-inflammatory medication . In September 2004 conduct pilot randomize control blind clinical trial efficacy montelukast reduce morbidity cause asthma exacerbation associate respiratory viral infection ( RVI ) child age 2 14 . We find highly significant reduction report symptom free day montelukast group . The current study randomize placebo-controlled trial montelukast , September 2005 confirm result pilot study examine effectiveness montelukast reduce asthma morbidity RVIs different age sex group range risk exacerbation . We also wish compare effectiveness montelukast placebo reduce asthma morbidity RVIs group child concurrently take class asthma control medication .</detailed_description>
