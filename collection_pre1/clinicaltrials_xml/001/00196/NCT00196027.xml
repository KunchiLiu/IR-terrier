	<brief_title>Paradigm I Clinical Trial : Study PFX Closure System Subjects With Cryptogenic Stroke , Transient Ischemia Attack Paradoxical Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patent Foramen Ovale implicate etiology paradoxical embolism , cryptogenic stroke , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , right leave gas embolism severe decompression illness . An association patent foramen ovale severe migraine headache also report . Several implantable device use percutaneous closure patent foramen ovale ; propose use non-implantable system safely effect closure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject 18 65 year old . Documented patent foramen ovale determine positive micro bubble study demonstrate right left shunt and/or anatomic detection functional assessment preoperative TCD perioperative echocardiography ultrasound . Subjects history cryptogenic stroke , transient ischemic attack paradoxical embolism due presume paradoxical embolism PFO . Negative pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . Signed Informed Consent form . Presence thrombus intend site closure , leave atrial appendage , document evidence venous thrombus vessel access PFO gain . Active endocarditis , infection produce bacteremia . Presence atrial septal defect fenestration allow righttoleft shunting . Presence implant cardiac valve , pacemaker , implantable cardioverters/defibrillators ( ICDs ) vena cava filter . Subjects intracardiac mass , tumor , clot vegetation . Large , redundant atrial septal aneurysm would prohibit adequate device access PFO closure PFO , judgment investigator . A coexisting redundant atrial septal aneurysm consider large prohibits ability operator adequately achieve vacuum suction necessary achieve PFO closure . Presence arrhythmia require pharmacologic electrical therapy intervention 1st degree block . Current enrollment investigational trial ( ) use device implant vascular system enrol experimental drug study ( y ) within three month study entry . History stroke TIA within past 14 day . Source stroke paradoxical embolization . Hemodynamic instability shock . Hypercoagulable disorder . Subjects coagulation disorder unable take antiplatelet anticoagulant therapy .</criteria>
