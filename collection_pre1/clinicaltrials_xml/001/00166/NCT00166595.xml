	<detailed_description>To knowledge investigator study document pharmacokinetics pharmacogenetics risperidone child PDD . Currently PPRU network conduct PK study whose aim establish new enantio-selective micro-assay methodology generate preliminary population PK data risperidone metabolite PDD . This study focus pharmacogenetic evaluation PDD patient little effect , unusually sensitive experience drug toxicity/adverse event standard risperidone dosage . In study two 5 ml blood sample draw regulary schedule PK visit . Alternatively pooled waste blood sample buccal swab obtain .</detailed_description>
