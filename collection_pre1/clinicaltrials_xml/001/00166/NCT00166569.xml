	<brief_summary>The goal study determine genetic basis polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) . We first look gene Icelandic population , large family tree know easy search gene . We determine whether gene important U.S. PCOS patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Genetics Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ( PCOS ) one common endocrine disorder woman . Its marked phenotypic variability , puzzle list associate condition , hence potential risk woman 's health lifecycle clearly remain clinical investigational , genetic , therapeutic challenge . To great extent , variability attribute marked genetic environmental heterogeneity population study . We plan address many long-term clinical research obstacles delineate genetic basis PCOS unique investigational venue , Icelandic population . Studying Icelandic population follow advantage : ) population 's relative genetic environmental homogeneity ; b ) remarkably rich genealogic database ; c ) centralize healthcare information . In unusual venue , cluster large number PCOS family know relationship possible . Their relative homogeneity genealogic characteristic reduce genetic variance hence use map genetic basis PCOS efficiently heterogeneous population . As gene responsible PCOS emerge , protocol also determine phenotype/genotype correlation Iceland , contrast US woman , assess long-term medical consequence . Each female subject ask arrive fasting morning . Women PCOS ask arrive least 10 day last menstrual period , woman regular menstrual cycle see within first 14 day menstrual period start . All subject ask fill extensive questionnaire . Subjects undergo history , physical exam laboratory exam . Blood drawn baseline DNA ( material cell hold gene ) , fast blood glucose insulin , HbA1C , total fractionate cholesterol , triglyceride , testosterone , androstenedione , DHEAS , SHBG 17-OH Progesterone . Additional blood drawn 10 20 minute measurement LH FSH , pulsatile . An oral glucose tolerance test optional . A standardized transvaginal ultrasound perform look ovary female subject . This do abdomen full bladder patient prefers . Male family member also undergo history , physical laboratory exams identical manner female family member addition specific notice hair distribution make . PCOS subject oral contraceptive hormonal medication may cholesterol , insulin , glucose , triglyceride HbA1C labs drawn , whereas subject insulin sensitize agent blood drawn test . These subject undergo ultrasound DNA sampling . All hormone blood sample Icelandic Boston subject examine Boston . All DNA test perform Genotyping Core deCODE , company Iceland . Therefore , DNA sample Iceland Boston analyze Iceland . The Boston blood sample cod sent DeCODE genotyping facility . The investigator Boston retain link code subject information lock area office . The name subject disclose deCODE .</detailed_description>
