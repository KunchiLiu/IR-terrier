Heparin work combine protein blood prevent proteins work together form clot . The protein heparin combine seem different infant young child compare adult . The purpose study determine proteins child direct impact way heparin work . We also want see may change different age . We enroll two age group child ; birth 2 year 10 year old . A total 125 patient enrol study . These patient already schedule open-heart surgery use heart-lung machine . The test involves take blood sample patient asleep surgery ; later intravenous line , IV .

	<detailed_description>Introduction Anticoagulation cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) necessary prevent clot blood come contact unphysiologic surface extracorporeal circuit , achieve administration unfractionated heparin bind antithrombin III ( ATIII ) potentiate accelerate inhibition thrombin activate coagulation factor . In adult , heparin dose response decrease ATIII concentration fall . Findings adult indicate administration supplemental ATIII concentration fall 80 u/dl may help preserve heparin 's effectiveness CPB ( 1 ) . Since ATIII level infant reach 80 u/dl 3-6 month age ( 2 ) , one would likewise anticipate heparin dose-response relationship would affect . However , preliminary investigation child less one year age show correlation preoperative ATIII concentration project heparin dose-response ( HDR ) curve change activate clot time ( ACT ) value heparin administration ( 3 ) . The lack correlation ATIII level heparin dose response infant raise important question pediatric patient regard mechanism heparin exert anticoagulant effect well adequacy heparinization CPB . Another coagulation inhibitor , heparin cofactor II ( HCII ) , form stable enzyme-inhibitor complex inhibits thrombin reaction enhance heparin ( 4 ) . Although adult population , exact role HCII unclear , perhaps neonates role significant . Alpha-2-macroglobulin ( 2M ) , less important inhibitor thrombin adult , concentration well adult value newborn continue increase concentration first 6 month life ( 2 ) . In neonate , 2M show important role thrombin inhibitor although association heparin response CPB unknown . The adequacy anticoagulation CPB assess extent heparin attenuate formation activation thrombin . However , short half-life thrombin presence heparin ATIII prohibit direct measurement thrombin concentration CPB . The peptide prothrombin fragment 1.2 ( PT1.2 ) , form prothrombin convert thrombin , readily measurable provide way evaluate thrombin formation CPB ( 5 ) . One thrombin 's major action , conversion fibrinogen fibrin , release another measurable peptide , fibrinopeptide A ( FPA ) , thereby provide mean assess thrombin activity CPB ( 5 ) . In attempt determine mechanism heparin exert anticoagulant effect child , investigation proposes evaluate relationship preoperative ATIII , HCII 2M level pediatric patient vary age group clinical measurement heparin response operating room , specifically change ACT value heparin administration generate heparin dose-response curve . We also propose evaluate adequacy heparinization neonate , know quantitative deficiency ATIII , measure PT1.2 FPA produce CPB compare adult population . Background The management coagulation system pediatric cardiac surgery complex task . Cardiopulmonary bypass significant thrombogenic stimulus require anticoagulation heparin prior initiation , completion bypass period , reversal heparin reestablishment hemostasis prior surgical closure . These manipulation toward hypo- hypercoagulability must accomplish care child . The inability attain either state within precise limit specify point surgical procedure far-reaching implication . Adequate inhibition coagulation cascade obviously necessary CPB prevent catastrophic clot formation CPB circuit . A state partial , inadequate , anticoagulation time still prevent clot formation lead formation coagulation product deleterious effect coagulation CPB : thrombin generate subsequently activate plasminogen fibrinolytic system ; fibrinolysis prevents reestablishment hemostasis perpetuate activation coagulation system ; thrombin , plasmin , fibrin degradation product severely disrupt post-CPB platelet function . Anticoagulation CPB accomplish administration heparin , empirically dosed basis patient weight . The degree heparin-induced anticoagulation cardiac surgery measure operating room assess heparin level assess heparin 's anticoagulant effect activate clot time ( ACTs ) . The commonly use method ACT monitoring . Unfortunately , ACT influence factor heparin , hemodilution hypothermia . While major concern adult old child , hemodilution accompany CPB extreme neonate young infant . Similarly , adult cardiac surgery perform normothermic mild hypothermic condition , surgical procedure infant often conduct extremely hypothermic temperature . Therefore , ACT measurements cardiac surgery infant may reflective degree heparin-induced anticoagulation . Indeed , heparin level young child significantly low found , maintain , consider safe CPB adult ACT measurement child remain range felt indicate adequate anticoagulation ( 6,7 ) In full term preterm infant coagulation system begin develop gradually gestation continue mature toward adult system postnatal period . By 6 month age , component coagulation system , procoagulants inhibitor , well within normal adult range ( 8 ) . However , birth coagulation system quantitatively immature significant deficiency many factor level . One deficient factor AT III . AT III level 60 % adult value birth attain adult level 3 6 month age . In face low AT III level , ability heparin produce adequate anticoagulation cardiac surgery infant become significant concern , reasonable consider potential difference coagulation neonates adult undergo CPB . Questions arise role diminish AT III level produce anticoagulant effect young infant . Further question arise adequacy anticoagulation cardiac surgery young infant since , accept standard care , ACT measurement , routinely used make determination . The first question address comparison AT III level well potential heparin cofactor level specific indicator inhibition coagulation system . The second question address measurement specific breakdown product release formation thrombin upon activation coagulation system .</detailed_description>
