	<brief_title>Detection Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Interferometry Gestational Trophoblastic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 Gestational trophoblastic disease ( GTD ) consist spectrum disorder characterize abnormal proliferation trophoblastic tissue . They include hydatidiform mole , invasive mole , choriocarcinoma placental site trophoblastic tumor ( PSTT ) . The incidence molar pregnancy Asian country 7 10 time great report incidence Europe North America . Although previously lethal disease , GTD consider today curable gynecologic cancer . This progress attribute available tumor markerhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) , chemosensitivity , incorporation aggressive multimodality therapy . However , delay diagnosis may increase patient 's risk develop malignant GTN adversely affect response treatment , therefore prompt identification GTN important . Approximately 20 % patient develop malignant sequela require administration chemotherapy evacuation hydatidiform mole . The overall cure rate patient nonmetastatic disease low-risk metastatic disease nearly 100 % .When chemotherapy give additional 1-2 cycle first normal hCG value , recurrence rate less 5 % . In contrast , high risk metastatic disease , chemotherapy continue hCG value normalize , follow least two three course maintenance chemotherapy hop eradicate viable tumor . Despite use sensitive hCG assay maintenance chemotherapy , 13 % patient high-risk disease develop recurrence achieve initial remission . Conventionally , serial quantitative serum hCG determination perform use commercially available assay capable detect Î²-hCG baseline value ( &lt; 5 mIU/ml ) . However , amount hCG produce correlate tumor volume serum hCG 5 mIU/mL corresponds approximately 104 105 viable tumor cell . Therefore , detection minimal amount human chorionic gonadotropin ( &lt; 5 mIU/ml ) crucial , could help early detect GTD strictly monitor residual activity tumor chemotherapy . Dual Polarisation Interferometry ( DPI ) analytical technique use understand real-time structure behaviour wide range molecular system interaction quantitative measurement include molecular size , density mass . DPI successful across range application , include protein , lipid , nucleic acid , lectin , surfactant , polymer , interfacial study , surface characterisation nanotechnology . Herein , try use novel analytical technique -Dual Polarisation Interferometry ( DPI ) , achieve detection minimal amount human chorionic gonadotropin early detection strict monitor GTD . Under circumstance , maintenance chemotherapy continue hCG value totally undetectable , hop eradicate viable tumor . Besides method could precise sensitivity specificity avoid false positive result could lead unnecessary chemotherapy surgery .</detailed_description>
