	<brief_summary>Abstract Biliary atresia ( BA ) idiopathic , progressive , fatal disease untreated . Since Kasai first introduce operation BA 1959 , encourage result treat disease . Ascending cholangitis frequent often recurrent complication . It may worsen prognosis , increase mortality , secondary failure restoration bile flow , possible exacerbation portal hypertension . For patient restoration bile flow timely portoenterostomy , recurrence ascend cholangitis single significant variable pertain long-term prognosis . Patients multiple episode ascend cholangitis likely require liver transplantation without multiple recurrence . Therefore , prevention cholangitis crucial management patient Kasai portoenterostomy . Some oral antibiotic , like trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ( TMP/SMZ ) neomycin show effect prevent ascend cholangitis . But , consider problem drug resistance long-term use antibiotic . Is well safer treatment ? Probiotics live microorganism , beneficial effect human health . Many study show probiotic effect treat prevent intestinal infection inflammation even patient liver transplantation . The aim study investigate possibility use probiotic prophylaxis ascend cholangitis . We want enroll 20 BA patient age 0 3 year , Kasai operation . Ten patient treat neomycin ( 25 mg/kg/d , qid , 4 day week ) . Another 10 patient receive Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus , Lcr 35 ( 8x108 CFU/day , bid ) The duration treatment 6 month . Bacterial culture stool perform treatment 1 month , 3 month 6 month treatment evaluate change intestinal flora . Another 10 BA patient , 1991 1996 , age 0 3 year , without prophylaxis portoenterostomy , serve historical control group . Comparisons episodes cholangitis , time first episode , body weight change make among three group .</brief_summary>
