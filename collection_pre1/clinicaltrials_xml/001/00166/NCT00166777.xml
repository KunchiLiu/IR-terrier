	<brief_summary>Quadriceps retrain , especially vastus medialis oblique muscle strengthening , play important role clinical management patellofemoral pain syndrome . Vastus medialis oblique muscle role dynamic stabilizer functional knee movement . It generate medial pull force patella lateral pull vastus lateralis . Thus improve patellofemoral joint compression force , reduce knee pain , increase functional ability , patient ’ quality life . Could vastus medialis oblique isolation way specific exercise without minimize recruitment vastus lateralis？ According human anatomy , vastus medialis oblique muscle origin hip adductor magnus tendon , thus incorporate hip adduction knee extension selective mean train need research . However , literature search show lot EMG study , need clinical research prove treatment effect kind strategy . The purpose study investigate treatment effect hip adduction combine knee extension exercise patient patellofemoral pain syndrome . We use muscle morphology quadriceps muscle , pain , functional ability main outcome measure . Besides , make compare traditional knee extension exercise . The first hypothesis study patient patellofemoral pain syndrome get improvement muscle morphology quadriceps muscle , pain , functional ability hip adduction combine knee extension exercise training . The second hypothesis patient patellofemoral pain syndrome receive hip adduction combine knee extension exercise training get improvement muscle morphology quadriceps muscle , pain , functional ability patient receive traditional knee extension exercise training . 90 patient patellofemoral pain syndrome less 50 year old include study , randomly distribute hip adduction combine knee extension exercise group , knee extension exercise group , control group . Following 8 week exercise train experimental physical therapist , ultrasound measurement muscle thickness cross-sectional area vastus medialis oblique muscle , vastus lateralis muscle , rectus femoris muscle component quadriceps , 10cm-VAS patellofemoral joint pain evaluation , include VAS-U , VAS-W , VAS-activity , Lysholm scale score measure . A two-way mixed ANOVA use compare mean difference thesis three group . The study aim provide clinical evidence evidence-based practice rehabilitation patient patellofemoral pain syndrome .</brief_summary>
