	<brief_title>Clonidine Neurocognitive Sequelae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long term prognosis many child diagnose brain tumor malignancy improve dramatically last decade expect continue rise result improved treatment . The increased survival pediatric oncology , however , associate increased recognition neurobehavioral sequela cancer treatment . Current understanding incidence , pathogenesis , natural history neurobehavioral abnormality limit considerable individual variation presence severity complication note . Central nervous system ( CNS ) abnormality associate childhood cancer treatment demonstrate least three level may interrelate : neurobehavioral abnormality , brain imaging abnormality , neurotransmitter abnormality . Patients randomize either clonidine placebo . Study medication administer double blind fashion begin four-week dose titration period follow four-week maintenance period . Total duration dose 18 week . Patients derive benefit clonidine administration may continue additional 30 week therapy . PK sample collect week 9 18 .</detailed_description>
