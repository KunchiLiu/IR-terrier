	<detailed_description>Adenocarcinoma endometrium fourth frequent cancer woman . Surgery treatment choice patient noninvasive locally advanced disease . The surgical technique consist exploratory laparotomy , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , peritoneal washing , , select high-risk patient , omental peritoneal biopsy lymphadenectomy . Therefore , preoperative clinical instrumental stag local spread disease , well local distant lymph node involvement , represent critical step tailor extent radicalness surgery . The role angiogenesis cancer growth metastasis gain much attention decade . Recent clinical evidence support notion . The gradual increase angiogenesis intensity tumor progression malignant melanoma report . Abulafia et al . observe increase angiogenicity simple hyperplasia , complex hyperplasia , atypical hyperplasia , Stage IA endometrial carcinoma invasive endometrial carcinoma find histopathologic examination . Several article report transvaginal color pulse Doppler ultrasound may helpful blood evaluation various gynecologic tumor . Besides , previous study also show incremental angiogenesis could demonstrate tumorigenesis possibility lymph node metastasis endometrial malignancy . Other growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , TGF- , IL-6 , IL-8 also report correlate angiogenesis metastasis endometrial cancer . It seem tumor angiogenesis endometrial cancer could utilize important parameter ass disease severity endometrial cancer . Determining microvessel density regard standard procedure quantitate tumor angiogenesis . However , microvessel density always assess retrospectively vitro . Preoperative prediction microvessel density would value clinically evaluate severity progression disease . So , would like propose proposal focus tumor angiogenesis endometrial cancer patient . Endometrial cancer patient receive stag surgery enrol study . Functional MRI , transvaginal sonography undergone surgery patient . The angiogenesis-related growth factor evaluate later surgical specimen . The clinical pathologic item , various angiogenic parameter obtain MRI sonography , angiogenesis-related factor compare correlate together . There several purpose study . First , evaluate compare tumor angiogenesis survey functional MRI power Doppler sonography endometrial cancer patient receive surgery . Second , evaluate whether tumor angiogenesis could marker predict disease severity endometrial cancer . Third , elucidate role functional MRI endometrial cancer . Endometrial cancer patient histopathologic proof arrange receive staging surgery eligible . All patient undergo surgery , include total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph node dissection sample . Surgical specimen evaluate tumor size , histologic grading , depth myometrial invasion , presence lymphovascular embolus lymph node metastasis . Stage determine use International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics classification . Tumors histologic type adenocarcinoma adenoacanthoma exclude . The carcinoma classify use three-grade system : grade 1 carcinoma show glandular formation 95 % tumor , grade 2 carcinoma show solid growth pattern 5-50 % , grade 3 carcinoma show solid pattern 50 % . All patient enrol study need sign consent form study protocol approval Institutional Review Board patient 's hospital .</detailed_description>
