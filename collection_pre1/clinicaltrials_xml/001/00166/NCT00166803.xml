	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular event lead cause death develop country worldwide , include Taiwan . The disruption atherosclerotic plaque subsequent formation thrombus currently recognize major cause morbidity mortality cardiovascular disease . Therefore , early detection vulnerable plaque clinically important risk stratification also provide early treatment . Several image approach adapt detect vulnerable plaque , however , base morphologic characteristic atheroma . We hypothesize PPARγ-induced plaque regression could monitor clinically use 18FDG PET/CT approach , could assess inflammatory activity , detect noninvasively earlier previously report .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The early detection vulnerable plaque clinically important risk stratification also provide early treatment.Inflammation important pathogenesis outcome atherosclerosis . Plaques contain numerous inflammatory cell , particular macrophage , high risk rupture . Diabetes major risk factor development atherosclerosis . The discovery peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ( PPARγ ) gene lead hope favorably influence insulin resistance syndrome . The administration PPARγ agonists show reduce insulin resistance , reduce expression leptin , low plasma free fatty acid level lower blood pressure . Moreover , beyond glucose effect , PPARγ agonists may theoretically affect atherosclerosis also inhibition inflammatory cytokine secrete macrophage , IL-6 , IL-1β , TNF-α , etc . These evidence highlight possibility PPARγ agonist could great impact plaque regression . 18FDG glucose analogue take cell proportion metabolic activity . Several paper report potential role metabolic image assessment inflammatory vascular disease , especially large vessel . However , PET limit spatial resolution . Recently , combine PET/CT emerge promising modality could provide anatomical functional information . We hypothesize PPARγ agonists-induced plaque regression could monitor clinically use 18FDG PET/CT approach , provide information early efficacy PPARγ treatment cause stabilization vulnerable plaque without affect lumen size .</detailed_description>
