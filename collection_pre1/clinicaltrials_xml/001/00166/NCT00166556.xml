	<brief_summary>This prospective , multicenter open-label single arm trial recipient liver allograft receive uniform immunosuppressive induction maintenance regimen . Participants end stage liver disease meet entry criterion consent enrol . Participants receive Campath-1H maintenance immunosuppression tacrolimus therapy . After one year tacrolimus therapy , assessment immunologic status include blood gene expression geno-race study perform include study liver graft biopsy . At time , patient select undergo immunosuppressive withdrawal . This make individual basis definitive inclusion exclusion criterion . The objective study evaluate safety efficacy immunosuppressive regimen comprise Campath-1H induction follow maintenance immunosuppressive therapy tacrolimus allograft survival . However , secondary objective ass withdraw tacrolimus Campath-1H induction immune depletion subsequent immune reconstitution . This study evaluate whether combination anti-rejection medication ( Campath-1H tacrolimus ) prevent rejection allow body develop tolerance transplant liver .</brief_summary>
