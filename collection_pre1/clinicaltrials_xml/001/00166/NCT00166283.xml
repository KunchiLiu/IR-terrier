	<detailed_description>Impairments high level cognitive processing , new learn memory , among common deficit individual Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) deficits show exert significant negative impact multiple aspect everyday life , include occupational social functioning . Despite finding , study attempt remediate cognitive deficit order improve everyday functioning individual MS . While limited research address efficacy memory retrain MS exist , research mar significant methodological flaw . Specifically , exist study memory retrain MS utilize : ( 1 ) randomize clinical trial ( 2 ) objective outcome assessment pilot research carry Kessler Medical Rehabilitation Research Education Corporation ( KMRREC ) . `` The Advisory Board recommend NCMRR initiate coordinate study effectiveness medical rehabilitation interventionsâ€¦using new precise quantitative measurement impairment , include functional societal limitation disability , particular emphasis disability societal limitation . '' The current proposal directly address recommendation NCMRR Advisory Board . It design ( 1 ) replicate pilot study large sample size ( 2 ) expand assessment measure good ass individual mild cognitive impairment , thus test effectiveness intervention within important subpopulation ( 3 ) ass effectiveness intervention utilize global measure everyday life , include objective measure ( Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test ) , preliminary support pilot study , well additional questionnaire complete participant significant ( 4 ) evaluate long-term effect treatment protocol ( 5 ) examine utility booster session facilitate long-term treatment effect . To meet study objective , conduct double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial , apply memory rehabilitation technique large sample MS participant . This protocol well-validated neurological population preliminary evidence support use MS exist . Individuals MS , document impairment memory new learning , randomly assign either memory retrain group placebo control group . Outcome measure several mechanism : ( 1 ) traditional neuropsychological ( NP ) battery ( 2 ) assessment global functioning ( AGF ) examine impact treatment daily activity . Both group undergo baseline , immediate follow-up , long-term follow-up assessment consist traditional NP evaluation , examines objective performance well-validated measure cognitive function , AGF , include self-report measure memory ability , self-efficacy , quality life , occupational functioning . In way , able objectively evaluate presence absence change memory performance NP assessment , also evaluate impact treatment protocol individual 's everyday life AGF . While study evaluate efficacy cognitive retrain usually employ pre-training post-training evaluation , evaluation criticize lack ecological validity . The present design allow assessment efficacy particular memory retrain technique within MS population use traditional measure , well assessment impact rehabilitation technique everyday life . In addition , include 6-month follow-up assessment measure long-term impact treatment objective cognitive functioning , NP assessment , everyday life , AGF . Finally , half participant experimental group participate monthly `` booster session '' follow completion treatment evaluate impact session maintenance treatment effect time . A subset sample also complete pre post neuroimaging evaluate change cerebral activation . Many study show new learn key problem MS . In addition , small pilot study , fund National Multiple Sclerosis Society ( NMSS ) administer current PI , test memory retrain protocol MS population . Results show deficits new learning treat , significant improvement note memory performance . However , impact memory retrain protocol everyday functioning remain unclear . The documentation efficacy memory retrain MS , particularly everyday functioning , could significant impact symptom management quality life live person MS. As , specific aim current research protocol follow . Aim 1 . This study objectively evaluate clinical utility memory retrain protocol improve performance objective test new learn memory large sample individual MS document deficit area . This protocol previously utilized traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) population small pilot sample individual MS , yield promise data . NCMRR state research analyze exist rehabilitation technique , empirically assess validity , provide justification consumer practitioner require advancement field medical rehabilitation research recognize high priority research area . Our study precisely . Aim 2 . We increase generalizability real life application assessment technique assess outcome follow cognitive retrain global measure everyday life . An objective measure everyday functioning include , well numerous subjective measure everyday functioning , gather via establish self-report instrument , well rating significant . Aim 3 . This study also assess efficacy memory retrain protocol mildly impair MS group , properly test previously . Due measurement ceiling effect pilot study , utility technique improve new learn memory ability individual mild deficit yet determine . The current study improve upon measurement technique use pilot study . Aim 4 : This study evaluate long-term efficacy memory retrain protocol inclusion 6-month follow-up assessment . Many cognitive remediation study literature examine efficacy treatment immediately follow program completion . However , give time , expense , labor involve intensive treatment , important demonstrate long-term efficacy program . The current study therefore go beyond typical protocol length evaluate long-term impact treatment objective test individual 's daily life . Aim 5 : Booster session use maximize long term benefit cognitive retrain patient population . However , utility booster session never investigate MS. An additional question address current treatment study impact `` booster session '' follow completion treatment protocol .</detailed_description>
