	<brief_summary>This study do find accurate Navigator continuous glucose monitor child . It also do see use Navigator improve blood sugar control help prevent low blood sugar event . This study three basic part : Use Navigator home one week without able see blood sugar reading ; Baseline visit 24-hour admission research unit hospital find well Navigator measure blood sugar ; 3 month use Navigator home aid diabetes care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Navigator Continuous Glucose Monitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 60 child recruit five center United States participate study . The information gain study use plan large study half patient use Navigator half . Children participate study eligible take part large study . The Navigator provide glucose read every 60 second ( 1440 reading day ) . Each sensor design provide reading 120 hour . It alarm hypoglycemia hyperglycemia project high low glucose value . The alarm set point adjust user . The Navigator also trend arrow indicate glucose rate change ( &gt; -2 mg/dL/min , -2 -1 mg/dL/min , -1 1 mg/dL/min , 1 2 mg/dl/min , &gt; 2 mg/dl/min ) . Subjects enter event , take insulin , ate , exercise . The sensor require calibration value enter 3 time first day wear 1-hour , 3-hours , 24-hours require additional calibration value . The value enter directly Navigator TheraSense Freestyle home glucose meter build unit . The Navigator yet approve FDA . The Navigator currently review FDA limit sensor wear 3 day . Beginning Study When child enters study , follow do : 1 . Questionnaires complete . - Parents child ( least 9 year old ) ask fill questionnaire computer clinic . The question child 's diabetes , diabetes treat , diabetes affect parent child . - Children use insulin pump therapy least 9 year old parent interview child 's diabetes management habit home . The interview conduct phone trained interviewer Nemours Children 's Clinic Jacksonville , Florida , one study sit . 2 . Blood drawn measure glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) . 3 . Parents child instruct use Navigator . The first sensor insert parent child guidance study nurse . During first week , parent child able see result Navigator . 4 . Children ask follow return Baseline Visit hospital stay 1 week later : - Check blood sugar use Freestyle meter build Navigator least 4 time day - Wear Navigator sensor everyday change sensor end day 5 - On day new sensor start , 3 fingerstick blood sugar reading use built-in Freestyle meter calibrate Navigator - Enter meal marker event Navigator time child meal snack - Insert new sensor 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 day child stay hospital - Bring used sensor , include package inserting device Baseline Visit hospital stay Baseline Visit Children use Lantus MDI therapy return Baseline Visit approximately one week ( 7-12 day ) enrollment visit . Hospital Stay Those child use insulin pump therapy return hospital stay approximately one week ( 7-12 day ) enrollment visit use Navigator 24 hour . The last sensor place home continue worn hospital stay . A new sensor also place child 2 sensor insert hospital stay see closely 2 sensor agree . A CGMS sensor insert calibrate one hour later . A small tube call catheter place vein child 's arm stay vein child hospital . From tube , small blood sample drawn every 30 minute hospital stay . After breakfast , blood sample take every 10 minute hour . For child least 7 year old , blood sample take every 20 minute period exercise afternoon . Procedures Home Baseline Visit Hospital Stay 1 . Use Navigator . - The Navigator worn time 3 month . - The sensor must replace every 5 day . - With sensor wear 4 blood sugar reading must do use built-in Freestyle meter calibrate Navigator . - Enter meal marker event Navigator time meal snack eaten . - Children may ask insert new sensor 5 day study visit allow study personnel look skin sensor wear 5 day . 2 . Download Navigator - Once week , child need download glucose result Navigator , email study coordinate center . 3 . Use Algorithms Diabetes Management Decisions - The study doctor nurse give parent child instruction ( Algorithms ) make change diabetes management result Navigator . The instruction use parent child make decision receive result device . 4 . Phone Interviews - After 3 day 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 week child leave hospital , one staff call see Navigator instruction diabetes management decision . We ask child ate last meal call . We also ask child sick stress . For female start menstruate , ask menstrual cycle . Study Visits Children return diabetes clinic visit 1 , 3 , 7 , 13 week hospital stay . At visit , follow do : 1 . Any used sensor , include package inserting device collect . 2 . The skin look Navigator worn . 3 . The Navigator child 's insulin pump download review parent child . 4 . The diabetes management instruction review parent child determine instruction helpful need change . At 3 , 7 , 13- week visit , parent child ( least 9 year old ) ask complete questionnaire much like disliked instruction give use result Navigator . At 7-week visit , follow also do addition child 's regular clinic visit : 1 . Blood drawn measure HbA1c . At 13-week visit , follow also do addition child 's regular clinic visit : 1 . Blood drawn measure HbA1c . 2 . Questionnaires complete - Parents child ( least 9 year old ) ask complete questionnaire phone interview do first visit . - Parents child ask complete one questionnaire much like use Navigator . 3 . If child willing continue use Navigator , give additional sensor use often would like return another regular clinic visit 3 month ( 26-week visit ) . At visit , skin look Navigator use , HbA1c measure , parent child ask complete questionnaire complete 13-week visit much like use Navigator instruction give use result Navigator . Those decide continue use Navigator see 26-weeks . - At 26-week visit , subject give choice continue study device approve FDA Abbott Diabetes Care longer provide supply study . Subjects agree continue study sign addendum inform consent . - Subjects continue study return clinic every 3 month follow-up visit . The procedure complete 26-week visit complete subsequent visit .</detailed_description>
