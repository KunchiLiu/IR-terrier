	<detailed_description>Dysphagia common problem rehabilitation medicine . To accurately evaluate disorder crucial manage group patient . Videofluoroscopic examination swallow ( VFSS ) generally regard “ gold standard ” assessment oropharyngeal dysphagia , especially detection laryngeal penetration subglottic aspiration . However , limitation widely acknowledge . VFSS perform widely radiation exposure , single time measure , aspiration may variable phenomenon . Moreover , VFSS may diagnose disorder swallow function since unflavored barium could disturb deglutition ability patient , particularly impaired cognitive function . As result , researcher seek reliable bedside evaluation method detect aspiration . Various bedside clinical evaluation neurological examination , water swallow test , swallow provocation test use identify predict aspiration . However , consider gold standard VFSS , prediction rate aspiration still unsatisfactory . Seeking non-invasive objective method evaluate swallow function continue many research . Ultrasonographic examination long use ass swallow function . It advantage ionize radiation examination possibility use real food instead barium meal test . Thus , subject examine repeatedly physiological status swallowing . However , ultrasonographic examination use assess oral phase swallowing . It accurately visualize tongue movement , measure oral transit time bolus , sometimes hypoid bone motion , apply evaluation pharyngeal phase swallow . Physically , laryngeal elevation essential component swallow movement pharyngeal phase . It ensure occlusion airway open criopharymgeus muscle , thus prevent aspiration . To evaluate laryngeal elevation crucial point manage dysphagic patient . The purpose project measure laryngeal elevation normal dysphagic patient cerebrovascular ( CVA ) accident use ultrasonographic technique . This work include four group subject . The first group consist 20 young subject ( &lt; 40 year ) ; second group consist 20 age-matched normal subject ; third group consist 20 CVA patient without swallow problem , fourth group consist 20 CVA patient dysphagia , proven VFSS .
