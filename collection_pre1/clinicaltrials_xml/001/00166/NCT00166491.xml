	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine difference two way control blood sugar insulin . In patient admit intensive care unit , blood sugar level often rise due stress illness surgery . Studies show patient well blood sugar keep normal . In order maintain normal blood sugar level , investigator often give insulin ( substance make body ) , decide much give base high blood sugar . This study compare two different way decide much insulin give compare well method keep blood sugar normal range . Both way control blood sugar institutionally-approved protocol part routine care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Improved outcome demonstrate tight control blood glucose critically ill patient . A number look-up algorithm base hourly glucose measurement titrate intravenous insulin develop intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Despite numerous publish algorithm , study investigate algorithm result optimal glycemic control critically ill patient . The purpose trial compare two institutionally approve intravenous insulin administration algorithm describe subsequent glycemic control . We hypothesize protocol allows variable insulin administration give blood glucose ( multiple algorithm ) associate optimal glycemic control . Optimal glycemic control define time spent within predetermine blood glucose range . In addition , number hypoglycemic episode mean maximum blood glucose concentration also measure . This trial determine insulin infusion algorithm effective term glycemic control , allow standardization glucose management accordance best practice .</detailed_description>
