	<brief_summary>Thirty-six subject hyperlipidemia metabolic syndrome and/or diabetes randomize double-blind manner either pravastatin 80 mg atorvastatin 10 mg daily . Oxidative stress ( dROMs assay measure lipid hydroperoxides , plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substance [ TBARS ] , aminothiol level ) brachial artery flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) measure baseline 12 week statin therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals high cholesterol level , diabetes metabolic syndrome ( collection abnormality high blood pressure , high triglyceride level [ fat ] , obesity , high blood glucose level ) increase risk develop harden artery heart disease . A group medication call statin , commonly use worldwide low cholesterol level , know reduce risk heart disease effect reduce cholesterol level . These medication also effect beyond lower cholesterol may help mediate beneficial effect heart blood vessel . These include reduced production molecule harm artery reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) increase number stem cell help repair vessel , call endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) . Recent study show different statin might different effect protect people develop heart disease . These difference may due difference non-cholesterol lowering process , subject study . Standard Care : The two statin use study , pravastatin ( Pravachol ® ) atorvastatin ( Lipitor® ) , approve use people high cholesterol level heart disease . These medication generally well tolerate minimal side effect . They approve use patient increase level EPCs reduce production ROS , therefore consider experimental indication . Currently drug specifically approve indication . How Problem Will Studied : These statin give patient high cholesterol either diabetes metabolic syndrome day 12 week . We , investigator Emory , measure level EPCs ROS administration statin . We also investigate well blood vessel dilate response medication perform image study forearm artery use ultrasound . The study blind equal chance receive either atorvastatin 10mg pravastatin 80mg likely low cholesterol level similar amount . How Research Will Advance Scientific Knowledge : The goal study determine atorvastatin increase number circulate EPCs reduce production ROS pravastatin . This may help explain difference drug observe recently publish trial .</detailed_description>
