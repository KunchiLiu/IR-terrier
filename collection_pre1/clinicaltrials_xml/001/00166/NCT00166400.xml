	<brief_title>A Randomized Clinical Trial Metoprolol Participants With Mitral Regurgitation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Mitral regurgitation ( MR ) frequent prevalence increase age population . Organic MR , due primary valvular lesion severe consequence determine degree , leave ventricular ( LV ) remodel dysfunction , leave atrial ( LA ) enlargement , lead poor clinical outcome . Surgery eliminate MR , carry notable risk applicable patient . Recent animal data suggest beta-blockade organic MR significant positive effect , particularly LV remodel . Therefore , chronically decrease MR , protect LV LA beta-blockade major goal medical therapy . However , effect chronic oral beta-blockade human MR uncertain recent practice guideline underscore gap knowledge recommend beta-blockade MR . Hence , trial treatment organic MR need . A large trial mortality-morbidity end-points desirable premature without knowledge magnitude mechanistic effect beta-blockade . The improvement intermediate end-points , mechanistically link outcome , measurable non-invasive quantitative technique form basis present clinical trial proposal . Hypothesis : Chronic beta-blockade therapy use Metoprolol weigh placebo produce sustain reduction consequence organic MR . Specific aim treatment improves ) degree MR ( decrease regurgitant volume , primary end-point ) , b ) LV remodel ( decrease LV end-diastolic volume index , second end-point ) , c ) LA enlargement ( decrease LA volume , third end-point ) compare placebo . Population : Patients MR organic ( intrinsic valve disease ) , isolate ( valve disease ) moderate ( regurgitant volume *30 mL/beat ) . Methods : A randomized clinical trial , placebo control , double-blind , without crossover , 12 month oral treatment potent beta-blockade ( Metoprolol XL 50 200mg QD ) titrate maximally tolerate dose . The trial precede acute study determine tolerance . End-points measure Doppler-Echocardiography quantitation MR ( regurgitant volume ) use combination 3 simultaneous method ( quantitative Doppler , two-dimensional echocardiography , proximal flow convergence ) echocardiography LV LA volume measurement . In addition cardiopulmonary exercise test measure peak O2 consumption baseline follow-up . This study seek enroll total 60 patient . The analysis base intention treat compare change regurgitant volume , LV end-diastolic volume index LA volume measure one year treatment active drug placebo . The result clinical trial provide strong evidence regard medical treatment patient organic MR define future strategy minimize mortality morbidity organic MR .</detailed_description>
