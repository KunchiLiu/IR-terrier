	<brief_summary>Children severe heart failure need immediate appropriate care . New good drug constantly develop . As drug approve adult use , use off-label child . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) encourage clinical study drug child extend appropriate use new medicine . This study involve nesiritide , approve congestive heart failure treatment adult August 2001 . The investigator ' use drug pediatric population severe heart failure encourage . The investigator wish formally determine pharmacokinetic safety Nesiritide child . The investigator enroll 30 patient cardiac intensive care unit severe heart failure . The data collect include weight , vital sign , laboratory result , echocardiography result . A research lab test call B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) do several time study . If patient still intravenous ( IV ) catheter , blood sample take IV . If patient IV , sample take fingerstick . The duration study first 2 day patient 's stay cardiac intensive care unit thru discharge evaluate endpoint safety Nesiritide . Additional information also collect patient get re-admitted within 30 day discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Nesiritide Pediatric Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nesiritide ( human recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide ) recently approve Food Drug Administration intravenous treatment patient decompensated congestive heart failure . Nesiritide study broad range patient , include elderly , woman , African Americans , patient history various cardiovascular condition include hypertension , diabetes , post myocardial infarction , atrial fibrillation/flutter , nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , leave ventricular diastolic dysfunction , acute coronary syndrome . However , clinical experience pediatric population limit . Nesiritide human B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) produce recombinant technology amino acid sequence naturally occur human BNP . BNP predominantly secrete cardiac ventricle response increase cardiac volume pressure overload . Its pharmacologic effect include hemodynamic , neurohormonal , renal . In adult study , hemodynamic effect characterize balance venous arterial dilation , result decrease preload afterload demonstrate reduction pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , pulmonary arterial pressure , systemic vascular resistance neurohormonal effect nesiritide favorably inhibit renin-angiotension-aldosterone system , lead decrease plasma aldosterone norepinephrine level . The renal effect often see nesiritide use increase urine output lower diuretic utilization . There currently publish article discuss use , include pharmacokinetics , nesiritide child . However , several center currently use drug - Columbus , Missouri ; San Diego , California ; Charleston , South Carolina ; Loma Linda , California . Our experience infant cardiac surgery old child heart failure encourage . In child receive nesiritide therapy , note significant clinical improvement appreciable side effect . Based initial experience , prospective study need perform order determine pharmacokinetics safety use therapy pediatric cohort .</detailed_description>
