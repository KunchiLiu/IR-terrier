	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy Memokath 051 ureteral stent long-term temporary minimally invasive mean provide ureteral drainage set malignant extrinsic ureteral obstruction secondary inoperable abdominal pelvic malignancy . Up 15 adult extrinsic ureteral obstruction secondary inoperable abdominal pelvic malignancy need ureteral stent drainage undergo outpatient placement ureteral stent . Ongoing monitoring continue long stent place .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drainage Malignant Extrinsic Ureteral Obstruction Using Memokath Ureteral Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Memokath 051 ureteral stent device design provide long-term temporary ureteral drainage set extrinsic ureteral obstruction secondary inoperable pelvic abdominal malignancy secondary change cause surgery , chemotherapy , radiation pelvic and/or abdominal malignancy . The management malignant extrinsic ureteral obstruction secondary inoperable neoplastic disease abdomen pelvis common urologic problem , important implication patient 's quality well quantity life , estimate generally range 6.5 23 month population . Currently , extrinsic ureteral obstruction usually manage double-J ureteral stent , place either cystoscopically , antegrade via percutaneous nephrostomy tube . Double-J stent prone encrustation obstruction time , necessitate stent exchange general anesthesia every 3 4 month . These repeat surgical procedure general anesthesia carry subsequent risk infection , drug reaction , iatrogenic injury , lead degradation quality life patient often year less live . To circumvent disadvantage , nickel-titanium Memokath 051 ureteral stent develop provide mean minimally invasive long-term temporary ureteral drainage . This prospective non-randomized clinical study evaluate efficacy Memokath 051 ureteral stent manage extrinsic malignant ureteral obstruction secondary inoperable abdominal pelvic malignancy secondary change cause surgery , chemotherapy , radiation pelvic and/or abdominal malignancy . Enrollment study subject take place period two three year total 15 patient . A control group 10 patient extrinsic ureteral obstruction secondary inoperable pelvic abdominal malignancy secondary change cause surgery , chemotherapy , radiation pelvic and/or abdominal malignancy treat urologic staff surgeon standard fashion retrogradely place double-J stent also follow every 3 4 month .</detailed_description>
