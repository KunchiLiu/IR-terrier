	<brief_title>Trial Oxaliplatin , Cytosine Arabinoside , Dexamethasone With Rituxan ( ROAD ) Patients With Relapsed Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients B-cell NHL come back chemotherapy typically treated cisplatin , high-dose cytosine arabinoside dexamethasone ( DHAP ) platinum-based treatment . Recent study show 37 % response rate patient large cell lymphoma immunotherapy Rituxan . Patients &lt; 75 year old otherwise good health may candidate high dose therapy stem cell rescue disease remain sensitive chemotherapy . Typically , patient administer 2 cycle DHAP ICE ( ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide ) , disease responds , proceed high-dose therapy stem cell support . Even patient consider transplant candidate also often treated DHAP ICE salvage regimen . It likely response rate DHAP alone patient eligible transplant &lt; 59 % . Recent study attempt improve result DHAP ICE combine rituxan . NCCTG complete phase II trial R-DHAP . Preliminary result R-ICE protocol indicate high response rate long time progression traditional ICE . The problem DHAP ICE associate significant side effect specifically , DHAP cisplatin often cause kidney problem . In fact , patient consider transplant eligible DHAP may become transplant ineligible simply kidney side effect . Clearly , need improve quality life patient undergoing treatment avoid kidney problem .</detailed_description>
