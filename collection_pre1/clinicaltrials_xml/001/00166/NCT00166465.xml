	<brief_summary>Phase I : The primary objective Phase 1 portion study determine Maximum tolerate dose recommended Phase 2 dose ALIMTA plus oxaliplatin give folate vitamin B-12 supplementation treatment patient unresectable , locally advanced metastatic colorectal cancer . The Phase I component study activate enrollment Mayo Clinic patient . Phase II : The primary objective Phase 2 portion study determine tumor response rate ALIMTA plus oxaliplatin oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil leucovorin patient locally advance unresectable Stage IV colorectal cancer receive prior chemotherapy advance disease . Patients randomly assign receive either ALIMTA plus oxaliplatin ( Arm A ) Oxaliplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil Leucovorin ( Arm B ) . The Phase II component study activate enrollment patient via Mayo Clinic Cancer Research Consortium mechanism . A comparison make side effect regimens .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ALIMTA , oxaliplatin , 5-fluorouracil ( alone leucovorin ) show activity single agent treatment colorectal cancer . Their different mechanism action make combination ALIMTA oxaliplatin attractive potential first-line therapy term improve response rate overall survival patient metastatic colorectal cancer . Current report combination oxaliplatin 5-FU first-line therapy suggest may advantage combine oxaliplatin antifolates treatment colorectal cancer . ALIMTA attractive candidate replace drug 5-FU combination oxaliplatin treatment locally advance metastatic colorectal cancer . ALIMTA potential advantage 5-FU combined oxaliplatin require single short injection inhibits multiple target folate pathway . Therefore , propose conduct trial report clinical effectiveness side effect ALIMTA plus oxaliplatin one current standard care , FOLFOX 4 regimen ( Oxaliplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil Leucovorin ) .</detailed_description>
