	<detailed_description>Arsenical cancer ( comprise skin , bladder , kidney , lung , colon liver malignancy ) prevalent southwestern coast Taiwan artesian water contaminate high concentration arsenic . Skin main target arsenical poisoning . The cutaneous manifestation chronic arsenism take form hyperpigmentation , hypopigmentation , arsenical keratosis arsenical skin cancer . The popular arsenical skin cancer Bowen ’ disease , carcinoma situ skin often confine sun-protected skin . Pathologically , several characteristic present Bowen ’ disease : ( 1 ) abnormal cell proliferation carcinogenesis keratinocytes ; ( 2 ) dysplasia apoptosis lesion ; ( 3 ) integrin deficiency/defect basal cell skin ; ( 4 ) dysfunction peripheral immune cell . Our pervious result indicate arsenic affected cell cycle regulation influence proliferation apoptosis keratinocytes . Furthermore , find integrins deficient basal layer lesional perilesional site Bowen ’ disease demonstrate immunohistochemistry . The integrin deficiency Bowen ’ disease might lead abnormality cell cycle regulation , differentiation carcinogenesis . In addition , arsenic destruct lymphocytes cytokine regulation induce lymphocytes apoptosis . We propose arsenic-induced lymphocyte dysfunction play important role biological mechanism arsenical Bowen ’ disease . There many regulatory mechanism involve progression chemical carcinogenesis , include reaction among carcinogen target cell , support cell immune interaction . Therefore , study investigate skin cell-cell interaction induce arsenic use organotypic epidermis culture model . By use model , mimic mechanism arsenic-induced skin disease . Which give u much information similar carcinogenesis progesee human body compare cell culture model . The effect arsenic epidermis formation , effect UVB arsenic arsenical carcinogenesis interaction immune cell skin cell study 3-year proposal describe : The 1st year : Study arsenical effect integrin expression , cell proliferation , differentiation apoptosis organotypic epidermis . The 2nd year : Study arsenic and/or UVB –induced biological change organotypic epidermis Bowen ’ disease . The 3rd year : Study interaction immune cell epidermal cell induce arsenic . This study give u much information similar carcinogenesis progesee human body compaired cell culture model . We hope result study provide useful model chemical carcinogenesis investigation field .</detailed_description>
