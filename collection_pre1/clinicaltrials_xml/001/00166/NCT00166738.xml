	<brief_summary>Persons schizophrenia experience imaginary voice , vision disorganize thought , handicap come social life , detrimental affected individual community . Although pathogenesis mental disease clearly elucidate , much evidence suggest inheritance major etiological importance multiple genetic component implicate . Previous linkage study familial schizophrenia lead successful identification numerous susceptibility loci cover many human chromosome , include chromosome 1q , 5q , 6p22 , 6p24 , 8q21 , 13q32 , 15q13-14 22q11 , etc . Necessities identification candidate gene involve familial schizophrenia take genome-wide approach list follow : 1. give multiple gene responsible disease , critical interest view complete molecular profile schizophrenia 's genome ; 2. identification promise schizophrenia candidate gene genome-wide scan facilitate development molecular marker provide objective effective assessment method psychotic diagnosis prognosis ; 3. prevention onset disorder improve early classification individual bear strong genetic loading schizophrenia high risk population ; 4. make breakthrough investigation schizophrenia pathogenesis characterization susceptible gene find genome-wide explore . Array-based comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) allow high-throughput genome-wide survey DNA copy number aberration , provide powerful tool investigate genetic disorder develop diagnostic therapeutic target . Arrays use study consist approximately 43,000 60-mer oligonucleotide probe span cod noncoding region whole human genome average spatial resolution around 35 kb . Furthermore , sensitivity array capable detect mapping region single-copy loss , homozygous deletion , amplicons various size even use full-complexity genomic sample . In study , investigator conduct array-based comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) genomic DNA many affect member `` schizophrenia family '' ( investigator classify family accord presence absence two affected member ) identify set candidate gene associate disease . It hop result obtain study improve accuracy efficiency psychotic treatment .</brief_summary>
