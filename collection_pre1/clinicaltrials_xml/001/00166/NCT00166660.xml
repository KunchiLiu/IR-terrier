	<detailed_description>The protocol aim demonstrate effectiveness intervention gear significantly improve functional competence preterm infant fetal growth restriction ( FGR ) . Incidence FGR estimate high 5 % general obstetric population . Preterms FGR doubly jeopardize . Aside much high mortality rate also show significantly increase morbidity rate , include significant learning disability school failure ( &gt; 50 % ) . The intervention 's underlying premise hold far effective support immature brain , compromise FGR , develop optimally infant reach full term rather attempt ameliorate increasingly deviant development deviance occur . The goal project show effectiveness individualize developmental care intervention , begin FGR preterm infant 's admission newborn intensive care unit ( NICU ) extend 2 week ( w ) full term equivalent age 2w CA ( correct age prematurity ) . Intervention NICU consider advantageous infant 's later development delay intervention discharge home . The proposal maintain last trim gestation critical period brain development , especially compromise FGR . In-NICU intervention critical brain development time expect reduce infant ' hypersensitivity reactivity NICU , lead reduction high incidence behavioral problem infancy , frequently foreshadow later behavioral learn problem well school failure . The study aim test three related hypothesis : 1 . Individualized developmental NICU care intervention enhance FGR preterm infant ' brain development functionally structurally . 2 . The in-NICU intervention improve parent ' understand infant 's individuality equip feel competent parent . 3 . The intervention , individualized infant , quantifiable reliably reproducible . The study : 1 . Test effectiveness intervention assess brain development functional adaptation high risk preterm population ( n=30 ) document intrauterine FGR bear 28 33w gestational age . 2 . Assess FGR preterm infant ' neurodevelopment within one week birth ( baseline ) 2w CA ( outcome ) . 3 . Compare result effectiveness intervention FGR preterm infant recently study cohort appropriately grow ( AGA ) preterm infant bear comparable gestational age , support intervention measure comparable way . The primary infant measure propose brain functional ( EEG coherence , neurobehavioral functioning ) brain structural assessment ( MRI ) . The goal examine direct causal connection correlation among population characteristic , intervention , ultimate outcome 2w CA . The project expect deliver comprehensive substantive result favor developmental NICU intervention FGR preterm infant well earlier study AGA population . The propose study expect demonstrate intervention effectiveness improve FGR preterm infant ' neurodevelopment . It anticipate intervention-based improvement brain structure function set stage improvement later performance , especially term behavioral/emotional adaptation , learn school achievement , critical life success .</detailed_description>
