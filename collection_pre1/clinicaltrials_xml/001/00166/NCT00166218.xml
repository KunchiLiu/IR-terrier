	<brief_summary>The normal heart four chamber . There two upper ( fill ) chamber call atrium . There two low ( pump ) chamber call ventricle . One ventricles pump blood lung get oxygen . This oxygenate blood return heart pump rest body ventricle . Sometimes baby born heart defect allow one low chamber ( ventricle ) work properly . This mean one ventricle must pump blood lung rest body . Babies bear defect must undergo multiple surgery , first usually do first week life . There machine FDA approve measure much oxygen deliver brain . This non-invasive ( outside body ) machine use Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) , similar technology use pulse oximetry routinely used measure level oxygen blood . At Children 's Healthcare Atlanta , typically place NIRS machine baby Cardiac Intensive Care Unit immediately first surgery monitor oxygen delivery brain . The monitor proven accurate situation . We want know use monitor ass oxygen delivery brain routine heart catheterization prior child 's second surgery . Once consent obtain , place probe child 's forehead pre-catheterization visit obtain reading 5 minute . The probes size quarter self-stick ( look like kind lead use measure baby heart rate [ EKG ] ) . The machine disconnect rest Pre-catheterization visit , however probes stay child 's forehead . Once child catheterization suite , machine reconnected . A sheath hollow tube routinely place blood vessel child 's neck groin catheterization . The doctor would place special catheter sheath measure oxygen level blood continuously . This monitor would calibrate use result blood sample routinely draw child 's IV . During sample , additional 2cc 's blood would collect measure lactate level . The lactate level indicator well child use oxygen . Once monitor calibrate , data collect 5 minute compare NIRS machine . The special catheter remove 5-minute time period , catheterization proceed usual . The NIRS probe stay child 's forehead entire catheterization data document . At end catheterization , probe remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study prospective evaluation single ventricle patient undergo routine cardiac catheterization prior second stage palliation . Upon arrival pre-catheterization area , NIRS probe place child 's forehead data along vital sign collect initial placement , 3 minute 5 minute . The monitor disconnect routine pre-catheterization procedure proceed . Once child catheterization suite , monitor reconnected routine catheterization procedure proceed . After standard sheath catheterization place child , routine superior vena cava saturation ( COOX ) drawn NIRS reading along routine vital sign document . At time routine saturation drawn , additional 2ccs blood drawn lactate level . At 3 5 minute routine saturation , COOX drawn NIRS reading along vital sign document . The catheterization continue usual . At end case , final NIRS reading vital sign document prior removal probe .</detailed_description>
