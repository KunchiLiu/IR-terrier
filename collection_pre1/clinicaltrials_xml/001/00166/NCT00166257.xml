	<brief_title>PC-Trial : Patent Foramen Ovale Cryptogenic Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient suffer stroke occlusion large artery another body part unknown origin possible cause small opening upper heart chamber ( patent foramen ovale , call ) . After birth opening close 75 % population , persist 25 % people . It may allow small blood clot pas vein legs heart brain part body . In order reduce risk attack today therapeutic option choose unclear strategy best outcome . This study create compare effect two treatment strategy : 1 . Medical treatment The purpose medical treatment dilute blood degree , thrombus formation occur . Since open heart persist , treatment usually recommend lifelong . And patient treat coumadin must undergo regular blood test ensure adequate effect drug . 2 . Catheter closure patent foramen ovale An alternative method develop close small open heart utilize catheter introduce blood vessel groin advance heart . An umbrella device deliver catheter , position within small defect release . The umbrella overgrown tissue within week month close small defect ever .</detailed_description>
