	<brief_title>A Trial Use Ultrasound Aid Insertion Combined Spinal Epidural Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study objective : The clinical evaluation novel ultrasound probe guide insertion central regional anaesthesia use regional anaesthetic needle modify aid insertion ultrasound guidance morbidly obese woman undergo elective caesarean section . - ( full title ) The clinical evaluation novel ultrasound probe- ( short title ) Background Rationale : Cases trauma conus medularis follow spinal anaesthesia highlight recently Reynolds1 . A second report vein describe inaccuracy use Tuffier 's line iliac crest identify safe lumbar interspace2 . As suspected many clinician , precise lumbar interspace identification palpation prone error . Broadbent2 et al confirm show anaesthetist 29 % accurate , determine MRI/ ( Ultrasonography investigate Broadbent ) . The inaccuracy corroborate Furness et al3 . show clinical identification anaesthetist use palpation 30 % accurate , assess lumbar spine X-ray . In contrast , latter study , placement marker use ultrasonography L3-4 interspace 71 % accurate , figure comparable 76 % accuracy preliminary study describe . It note Furness study ultrasonography perform consultant radiologist study anaesthetist perform procedure . The Broadbent Furness study document identification anaesthetist use palpation often inaccurate two , three four interspaces . Using ultrasound , Furness3 study study , marker always within one interspace intend position . Morbid obesity increasingly prevalent problem obstetric practice . Landmarks often impalpable obese patient make insertion epidural problematic . Thus clear clinical need develop safe efficient way administer epidural anaesthesia . The central hypothesis application ultrasonic visualisation landmark aid insertion . Further possible develop manufacture probe general use anaesthetist improve current clinical practice problematic area . Initial study investigate accuracy ultrasound non radiologist : An exploratory study undertaken determine precision anaesthetist could identify correct L3-4 interspace use ultrasonography . Twenty-three ultrasonographic examination lumbar spine perform anaesthetic senior house officer minimal training patient undergo elective MRI scan lumbar spine . Seventeen patient eligible inclusion study . Patients ' median age 47 year , body mass index 27 kg/m2 . In 13 17 ( 76 % ) patient , SHO use ultrasonography able place marker correctly L3-4 interspace indicate MRI . In four patient , marker L2-3 interspace . In five 17 patient apposition spinous process note MRI scan three patient marker L2-3 interspace . Ultrasound use aid insertion central neuraxial anaesthesia three occasion . ( Watson et al unpublished ) . The 3 case describe successful ultrasound assist insertion three neuroaxial block allow emergency elective caesarean section . The first two report base woman undergo emergency elective section two consecutive pregnancy complicate obesity pre-eclampsia . The third case report complicate previous spinal fusion surgery lumbar disc prolapse . Aim : To determine novel ultrasound transducer provide method reduce time take insert combine spinal epidural anaesthetic obese woman undergo elective caesarean section Study population : Sample Population : The maternity hospital involve trial excess 25,000 delivery per year significant percentage mother come privileged background high incidence morbid obesity . A study population 46 patient recruited woman undergo elective caesarean section Study procedures Randomisation patient : Randomisation two group computer generate block randomisation method . This information record seal envelope place labour ward princess royal maternity . Patients meet inclusion criterion consent sequentially assign number correspond seal envelope . Method : Prior study start recruit consent 10 elective section patient optimise quality control image split array ultrasound transducer . In order evaluate clinical efficacy ultrasound probe randomise comparison traditional clinical method palpation ultrasound guide insertion ( CSE ) combine spinal/epidural anaesthetic undertaken . The combined spinal epidural ( 17/18G 90mm rodiera tip tuohy needle 123mm 27G spinal needle manufacture Sarstedt use patient tuohy needle sand bead blast , desterilised repackaged prior use . All patient spinal anaesthetic 2.4mls heavy bupivacaine 22G epidural catheter sit via 16G tuohy needle diamorphine fentanyl . All anaesthetic procedure undertake experienced anaesthetist . However patient ultrasound group insertion tuohy needle guide ultrasound compare current method palpation . All patient undergo elective caesarean section . Patient 's ultrasound insert use palpation may transfer ultrasound guide group 30 minute attempted insertion discretion anaesthetist treat patient . Withdrawal patient study : Any patient may withdraw study time without give reason justification . Any protocol violation result patient immediately withdraw study If patient require emergency caesarean section withdrawn study If patient labour prior intend date operative delivery withdrawn study Any patient undergo caesarean section withdrawn study Statistical consideration : Primary end point : The primary end point time take insert epidural catheter . Secondary end point : The number time skin puncture The number time cortex bone touch epidural needle The number conversion regional ( central-neuraxial ) general anaesthesia Patient satisfaction score immediately post op 30 minute post op The volume concentration supplementary local anaesthetic administration follow primary spinal blockade caesarean section Number needle advancement Number conversion general anaesthesia Number 'dry spinal tap ' Patient number : A population 46 patient require assume mean time insert combine spinal epidural without ultrasound guidance 15 minute ultrasound guidance 10 minute standard deviation 5 minute group ( power=90 % , alpha error =0.05 ) . Assessment Safety Efficacy : The time take perform CSE record moment skin sterilise moment epidural catheter fix skin . A record number attempt number time bone encounter needle record . If patient palpation group require ultrasound assistance locate epidural space also record . Drugs administer systemically intrathecally epidurally document . Patients assess immediately insertion CSE regard comfort procedure pain experience . They shall also reassess 30 minute postoperatively ascertain overall satisfaction technique surgery , ensure pain experienced operation . They also visit first postoperative day , specifically look complication CSE headache neuropraxia , receive final check prior discharge 5 day ensure adverse event occur .</detailed_description>
