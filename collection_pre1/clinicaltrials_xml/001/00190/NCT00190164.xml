	<brief_summary>Rational study : There argument think closure macular hole obtain without strict position certain condition , i.e . hole size ≤ 400 µm , patient avoids position lay back . In order able confirm observation , necessary make randomize study adequate number patient . Aim study : To show percentage success ( anatomical closure confirm OCT ) low group without position . Tested Hypothesis : The absence strict position `` least effective '' success surgery small macular hole imposition strict positioning . Expected result : To show success rate surgery idiopathic macular hole 400 µm less decreased replacement strict positioning ( face-down 22h/24 ) simple instruction avoid position lay back , thus avoid patient painful part treatment allow reduction duration hospitalization consequently reduction cost treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rational study : There argument think closure macular hole obtain without strict position certain condition , i.e . hole size ≤ 400 µm , patient avoids position lay back . In order able confirm observation , necessary make randomize study adequate number patient . Main Aim study : To show percentage success ( anatomical closure confirm OCT ) low group without position . Tested Hypothesis : The absence strict position `` least effective '' success surgery small macular hole imposition strict positioning . Primary outcome : Frequency success define anatomical closing . Secondary objective : To show non inferiority technique without position follow variable : - ETDRS visual acuity third postoperative month . - Progression cataract - Frequency complication . Design study : Randomized multicentric study , parallel group , open , individual benefit patient . Number subject duration study : 68 patient , divide two parallel group , 18 year , present hole ≤ 400 µm , include followed period 3 month . The estimated total duration study 27 month . Data analysis : In case equivalence clinical trial margin non inferiority fix 15 % . The secondary criterion consequently analyze . Expected result : To show success rate surgery idiopathic macular hole 400 µm less decreased replacement strict positioning ( face-down 22h/24 ) simple instruction avoid position lay back , thus avoid patient painful part treatment allow reduction duration hospitalization consequently reduction cost treatment .</detailed_description>
