	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether carotid angioplasty stent ( CAS ) safe effective carotid surgery regard : 1. risk stroke death within 30 day procedure ; 2. long-term risk ipsilateral carotid territory stroke , patient recently symptomatic , severe carotid stenosis suitable CAS carotid endarterectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EVA3S : Endarterectomy Versus Angioplasty Patients With Severe Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Findings two large randomize clinical trial - NASCET ECST - establish endarterectomy standard treatment severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis . Compared endarterectomy , stenting without cerebral protection advantage avoid general anesthesia incision neck could lead nerve injury wound complication . The cost may less surgery , mainly short hospital stay . However , stenting also carry risk stroke local complication . Unlike endarterectomy , know long-term benefit , stenting remove atheromatous plaque , long-term efficacy technique need also assess . Several trial progress Europe United States . We establish trial evaluate whether stenting inferior endarterectomy concern ( ) risk stroke death within 30 day procedure ( b ) long-term risk ipsilateral stroke , patient recently symptomatic , severe carotid stenosis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In brief , patient eligible experienced carotid TIA non disable stroke within 4 month randomisation atherosclerotic stenosis region ipsilateral carotid bifurcation 60 % , determine North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial ( NASCET ) method , investigator believe suitable carotid endarterectomy endovascular treatment . The degree stenosis warrant treatment initially set 70 % subsequently set 60 % great reflect current generally accepted practice treatment symptomatic carotid stenosis . The presence 60 % ipsilateral carotid stenosis confirm conventional digital subtraction angiography combination carotid Duplex scan magnetic resonance angiography , provide result noninvasive technique concordant . Patients include disable stroke ( mRS &gt; =3 ) , non atherosclerotic carotid disease , severe intracranial carotid artery stenosis , contraindication heparin , ticlopidine clopidogrel . There age limit . The presence contralateral occlusion and/or angiographic appearance stenotic lesion factor treatment selection . The randomisation algorithm take centre degree stenosis ( le 90 % stenosis ) account . Patients must treat soon possible random assignment , case within 2 week randomisation .</criteria>
