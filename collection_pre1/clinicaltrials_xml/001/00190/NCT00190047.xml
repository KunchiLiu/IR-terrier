	<brief_summary>This study examine DP-b99 improve neurological function ( example strength coordination ) 3 month acute stroke</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Of DP-b99 On Neurological Function In Subjects With Acute Ischemic Hemispheric Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include Screening/Baseline Period , Treatment Period , Post-treatment Follow-up Period . During Screening Period , subject select study basis inclusion exclusion criterion ( see ) . A screening compute tomography scan exclude brain bleeding perform . The patient 's informed consent obtain . The patient randomly allocate DP-b99 placebo . Immediately randomization baseline assessment ( lab test ECG ) , subject give 2-hour intra-venous infusion DP-b99 placebo . Additional 3 infusion give daily total 4 consecutive treatment day , make `` Treatment Period '' . Throughout 4-day Treatment Period treatment 's safety National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score evaluate daily . ( The NIHSS assess certain ability patient , e.g . strength , speech , vision coordination ) . If condition require , patient may stay hospital 4 day , regardless participation study.Subjects assess NIHSS score change safety ( lab test ECG ) Post-treatment Follow-up Period , data collect 30 90 day stroke . Other outcome scale ( Barthel Index Modified Rankin Scale ) also use Day 30 Day 90 visit</detailed_description>
