	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( Af ) common morbid event open heart surgery . Its incidence range 19 % 27 % , report Society Thoracic Surgeons database . Many group try understand treat difficult problem formulate different hypothesis explain origin . An imbalance autonomic nervous system surgical intervention accept major determinant morbidity . Ventral cardiac denervation fast low-risk procedure . This intervention show significantly reduction incidence severity Af routine coronary artery bypass surgery . This technique could apply on-pump off-pump use adjunctive procedure achieve Af prophylaxis . However , detailed mechanism remain unclear . Theoretically , heart receive innervation autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) via great vessel pericardial attachment . The propensity distribution ANS nerve fiber different location . In study , would like evaluate ANS function ventral cardiac denervation use heart rate variability ( HRV ) baroreflex ( BRS ) sensitivity . 30 patient propose elective off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery enrol . After induction anesthesia , depth anesthesia control inhalation agent monitor bispectral index . After major cardiac operation , ventral cardiac denervation perform use electrocautery . The digital signal heart rate blood pressure acquire surgical procedure range bispectral index ( 50~60 ) . The paired HRV BRS analyze . This provide u information justify procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass ventral cardiac denervation : Off-pump coronary artery bypass ( OPCAB ) perform base patient 's coronary angiography . Following completion coronary anastomosis , ventral cardiac denervation achieve remove nerve around large vessel base heart run right side superior vena cava end level midportion anterior pulmonary artery . This do excising fat pad surround superior vena cava , aorta , anterior right lateral aspect main pulmonary artery . Hemodynamic study : All patient underwent OPCAB Swan-Ganz catheter institute . Cardiac output measurement obtain thermodilution method . Hemodynamic variable ( systemic blood pressure , pulmonary artery pressure , central venous pressure , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , systemic vascular resistance , pulmonary vascular resistance , etc ) record measurement . ECG blood pressure monitoring system : ECG radial arterial blood pressure record analog digital converter system ( National Instrument Inc. ) . The analog signal digitize rate 500Hz store hard disk . The data analyze program write MATLAB language ( version 5.2 , MATHWORK Co. ) . QRS complex automatically classify manually verify normal sinus rhythm , arterial ventricular premature beat , noise comparison adjacent QRS morphologic feature . The N-N interval time series transfer personal computer post-processed . Data acquisition : Immediately induction anesthesia , patient intubate . Routine indwelling catheter , like CVP SG catheter insert . Prior skin incision , depth anesthesia monitor BIS system use bispectral index ( 60~70 ) adjust inhalation agent . Digital ECG BP signal record 15 min without mechanical pharmacological interference . After completion surgical procedure , data acquisition repeat operation room level anesthesia . Baroreflex sensitivity analysis : The analysis BRS conduct sequence method spectral ( α-index ) method . Sequence method : In brief , beat-by-beat time series systolic arterial blood pressure ECG R-R interval scan identify sequence three consecutive beat systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) R-R interval next beat change concomitantly increase decrease sequence . Such beat-to-beat sequence identify baroreflex sequence . A linear regression apply individual sequence r2 value &gt; 0.85 accept . The measure type integrate spontaneous BRS obtain average accepted slope type 5-minute recording . Spectral ( α-index ) method : The α-index ( α ) obtain mean simultaneous spectral analysis R-R interval SBP variability , calculation make square root ratio R-R interval SBP variability low frequency ( LF ) band ( αLF , 0.04 0.15 Hz ) . The coherence R-R interval SBP assess cross-spectral analysis . The α-index calculate magnitude square coherence ( K2 ) RR SBP signal exceed 0.5 LF band . Heart rate variability analysis : The miss interval raw N-N data linearly interpolate resampled 4 Hz Ron-Berger method . Each 5-minute segment N-N interval take HRV analysis . The time domain measurement HRV include SDNN , r-MSSD . The frequency-domain measurement HRV include LF HF , calculate Welch 's averaged periodogram N-N interval .</detailed_description>
