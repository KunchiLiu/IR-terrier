	<brief_summary>Cardiac syndrome X characterize angina , positve stress test , patent coronary angiography , probable mechanism microvascular dysfunction associate endothelial dysfunction . We use brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation ass endothelial function patient syndrome X , coronary artery disease , control . Methods : We enrol 28 patient syndrome X , 11 healthy volunteer 11 coronary artery disease patient . All subject underwent 2-step brachial artery flow-related vasodilation test : ultrasound artery diameter measure rest occlusion ass endothelium-dependent vasodilation sublingual nitroglycerin determine endothelium-independent condition . Serum endothelin-1 assay perform participant . Results : The cardiac syndrome X patient lower brachial artery dilation ratio ( diameter test/ diameter test ) control ( 1.10 +/- 0.09 versus 1.27 +/- 0.11 , p=0.013 ) , ratio still high CAD patient ( 1.10 +/- 0.09 versus 1.02 +/- 0.07 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . After sublingual nitroglycerin , 50 subject adequate vasodilation . Besides , normal control higher endothelin-1 level others . We conclude syndrome X patient worse endothelial function healthy control , patient CAD even bad endothelium function cardiac syndrome X patient . Keywords : Cardiac syndrome X , coronary artery disease , endothelium-dependent vasodilation , endothelium-independent vasodilation , flow-mediated vasodilation , endothelin-1</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac syndrome x ( CSX ) , define combination typical chest pain , electrocardiography nuclear medicine evidence suggest myocardial ischemia , patent coronary arteriogram , comprise approximately 10-30 % patient undergoing coronary angiogram.1,2 However , since first introduced 1973 , pathogenesis CSX remain enigma.1 , 2 Among hypothetic explanation CSX , include abnormal pain perception non-cardiogenic origin pain , coronary microvascular dysfunction ( microvascular angina ) , represent reduced microvascular dilatory response increase resistence , consistently find CSX patient . 2 , 3 This microvascular angina believe bridge gap ischemic evidence normal-looking coronary tree CSX , seem attributed endothelium dysfunction ( ED ) , another frequently report abnormality CSX.2.3 By definition , ED characterize endothelium-dependent vasodilation ( EDVD ) impairment , believe cause decreased release NO activity and/or activity , endotheliumindependent vasodilation ( EIVD ) remain preserved . 2,3,4 Therefore , assert endothelium-dependent dilatation resistance coronary artery defective patient CSX , defect may contribute altered regulation myocardial perfusion patients.5 On hand , ED play pivotal role development , progression , clinical manifestation atherosclerosis , well development ischemia thrombosis late stage disease , promote coronary vasoconstriction thrombosis.4 Instead use invasively intravascular measure method use endothelial function assessment , Celermajer et al first introduce non-invasive measurement flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) forearm brachial artery assessment EDVD EIVD.6 This method report good correlation invasively intravascular study coronary systems.4 In study , want compare difference forearm FMD , respond specially program stimulus , three patient group : CSX , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , normal volunteer . A two-staged stimulation strategy utilized ass EDVD ( cuff occlusion ) EIVD ( sublingual nitroglycerin ) consecutively . A baseline plasma endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) concentration also check patient enrol .</detailed_description>
