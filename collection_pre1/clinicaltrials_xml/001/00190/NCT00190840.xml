	<brief_summary>In previous phase 2 study , pemetrexed show antitumor activity advance non-small cell lung cancer single agent well combination cisplatin . Since introduction vitamin supplementation , pemetrexed show good tolerance high safety . Vitamin supplementation open opportunity offer patient higher pemetrexed dosing , demonstrate recent Phase 1 study . The high dose supplementation may increase pemetrexed 's efficacy without unduly compromise safety . The present Phase 2 study use pemetrexed dose tailor individual patient tolerance , effort determine efficacy safety approach patient advance NSCLC prior chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
