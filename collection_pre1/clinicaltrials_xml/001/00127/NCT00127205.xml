	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Zoledronate , clodronate , ibandronate may delay prevent bone metastases patient nonmetastatic breast cancer . It yet know whether zoledronate effective clodronate ibandronate treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study zoledronate see well work compare clodronate ibandronate treat woman undergone surgery stage I , stage II , stage III breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare disease-free survival overall survival woman resect primary stage I-III adenocarcinoma breast treat adjuvant zoledronate v clodronate v ibandronate . - Compare distribution sit first disease recurrence patient treat drug . - Compare adverse event patient treat drug . - Correlate parathyroid hormone relate protein status N-telopeptide level baseline disease-free survival site first recurrence patient treat drug . - Investigate whether association inherit germ-line single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP , rs2297480 ) farnesyl diphosphate synthase ( FDPS ) adverse event acute phase reaction patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive zoledronate IV 15 minute month 6 month every 3 month 2.5 year . - Arm II : Patients receive oral clodronate daily 35 month . - Arm III : Patients receive oral ibandronate daily 35 month . Treatment arm continue absence disease recurrence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month disease recurrence annually 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 5,400 accrue study .</detailed_description>
