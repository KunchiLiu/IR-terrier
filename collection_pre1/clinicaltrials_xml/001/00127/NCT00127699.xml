	<brief_title>Triple Dye Plus Alcohol Versus Triple Dye Alone Newborn Umbilical Cord Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection umbilical cord newborn serious condition even lead infant death . It well document source infection among infant hospital cross-contamination infant ; S aureus carry infant infant nursery caregiver . Current accept cord care practice include aseptic technique cut umbilical cord , apply antimicrobial agent , hand washing , dry cord care roll diaper cord enhance drying ( Evens , et . al , 2004 ) . Many study perform identify best cord care practice . Zupan , et . al ( 2004 ) perform meta-analysis 21 study investigate cord care . Between 21 study many antimicrobial agent use , include alcohol , triple dye , silver sulfadiazine , zinc powder , chlorhexidine , salicylic sugar powder , along dry cord care . It identify limited research show significant difference outcome antimicrobial agent use simply keep cord clean dry . In high-income country mortality low , important outcome must include infection first month life , maternal satisfaction , time cord separation . At current time , research identifies usefulness apply colostrum , bacteriostatic property , umbilical cord . A prospective control trial conduct Golombek , S. , et . al ( 2002 ) compare cord separation time infant treat triple dye compare alcohol . Of 634 patient enrol , one infant triple dye group diagnose omphalitis ; one infant alcohol group diagnose ear infection . There statistically significant difference cord separation time , alcohol group short separation time 3 day ( alcohol group 10 day , versus triple dye group 13 day ) ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . Nursing staff report satisfaction alcohol alone . Parents universally express relief cord separation group . Janssen , P. , et al ( 2003 ) compare cord bacterial colonization morbidity among newborn whose cord treat triple dye alcohol versus dry cord care . Seven hundred sixty six infant enrol randomized triple dye alcohol group dry cord care group . Study group similar respect . Significantly mother dry care group state infant 's physician mention concern infection compare none triple dye group . There differences report rate mother contact physician regard concern infection . The significant difference observation community health nurse two group periumbilical area exudate ( p &lt; 0.001 ) foul odor ( p &lt; 0.04 ) notice dry cord care group . Though one infant entire study develop omphalitis , dry cord care group , infants dry care group significantly likely colonize E. coli , coag-neg staph , S. aures , group B strep . Topical antimicrobial cord care may reduce bacterial colonization cord ; firm relationship colonization infection . Parents express apprehension cleaning cord 's black appearance brittle , rigid texture suggest break hurt infant touch . Though report scientific literature , increase rate breastfeed may offer protection newborn infection . The study suggest omphalitis remain clinical entity potential risk discontinue bacteriocidal treatment umbilical cord stump . Cessation bactericidal care umbilical stump must accompany vigilant attention education parent sign symptom omphalitis .</detailed_description>
