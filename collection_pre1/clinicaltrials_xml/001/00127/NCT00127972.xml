	<brief_title>2NN &amp; CHARM Long-Term Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 2NN study complete , first large randomise trial compare efficacy safety ART contain two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( nRTI : d4T+3TC ) either NVP-od , NVP-bd , EFV combination NVP+EFV treatment chronically HIV-1 infected ART naive patient . Data randomize study show significant difference response treatment , virologic immunologic efficacy single NNRTI arm NVP-od , NVP-bd EFV . This contrast previous cohort study , show relative hazard virologic treatment failure two start NVP compare start EFV . Despite result 2NN study , question remain whether comparability NVP EFV maintain long period follow-up . Therefore , study design assess durability efficacy regimen use 2NN study . In initial CHARM study , effect add nevirapine and/or hydrea triple NRTI regimen ( trizivir i.e . abacavir , lamivudine zidovudine ) term efficacy tolerability investigate anti retroviral naïve patient . The primary endpoint treatment failure follow 72 week . A total 229 patient include . The use hydrea prematurely stop add hydrea significantly contribute treatment failure enhancement toxicity associate use . Subjects nevirapine group reach plasma HIV-1 RNA level &lt; 50 copies/ml quicker ( log rank test p = 0.011 ) . In addition , treat analysis 16.2 % subject add nevirapine versus 39.5 % add nevirapine reach primary endpoint ( p=0.027 ) . These result resemble finding ACTG A5059 study . The trizivir arm ACTG study stop , anti-retroviral naïve subject randomize receive trizivir experience virological failure earlier frequent subject randomize receive either two treatment regimen evaluate study . The two treatment regimen : 1. combination zidovudine plus lamivudine plus efavirenz 2. trizivir plus efavirenz . It desirable obtain extended follow data subject participate CHARM study order see beneficial effect add nevirapine trizivir continue even increase 72 week treatment . In addition main objective , another important issue regard know association use nevirapine occurrence certain untoward effect , include development rash , clinical hepatitis hypersensitivity syndrome usually present rash , elevate alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase , eosinophilia host constitutional symptom . The possibility metabolite nevirapine might responsible one event evaluate could confirm . Data equivocal whether nevirapine level associate event , probably `` noise '' retrospective analysis use . Animal model would suggest , though , supratherapeutic nevirapine level associate event . It seem reasonable assume sub-population people risk event ( especially hypersensitivity ) base genetic make-up know many patient easily tolerate significantly elevate level nevirapine others may get side effect relatively normal level . To facilitate safe administration nevirapine patient , study also aim identify gene gene closely associated event , phenotype associate genotype increase risk .</detailed_description>
