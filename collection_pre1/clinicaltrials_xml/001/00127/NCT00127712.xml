	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize medication amiodarone decrease incidence atrial fibrillation ( AF ) follow non-cardiac open-chest surgery . Their specific aim : - Determine effectiveness amiodarone prevention AF follow non-cardiac open-chest surgery ; - Determine influence prevention AF follow non-cardiac thoracic surgery post-surgical duration stay Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) ; post-surgical duration stay hospital unit employ cardiac monitoring ; duration post-surgical hospital stay ; - Determine safety amiodarone prevention AF follow non-cardiac open-chest surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Atrial Fibrillation Following Noncardiac Thoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thousands patient undergo major non-cardiac open-chest surgery United States year . These surgery often consist lung surgery , one lobe lung remove ( lobectomy ) entire lung remove ( pneumonectomy ) . A major complication non-cardiac open-chest surgery occurrence irregular heartbeat know atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , develop 40 % patient undergoing procedure . AF characterize rapid , irregular , chaotic beating two small chamber heart ( atrium ) , lead rapid , irregular beat two large chamber ( ventricle ) . The average time occurrence post-surgical AF 2-3 day follow surgery . AF occur follow major non-cardiac open-chest surgery result extremely rapid heart rate , fast 150-200 beat per minute , may associate serious consequence , include severely low blood pressure potentially debilitate stroke . Further , risk death follow non-cardiac open-chest surgery significantly high patient develop AF compare . Therefore , occurrence irregular heartbeat follow non-cardiac open-chest surgery associate severe , potentially life-threatening consequence . Prevention irregular heartbeat patient may therefore important . Amiodarone medication know effective prevention treatment AF occur patient undergone surgery . In addition , amiodarone show effective prevention AF follow open-chest heart surgery . However , use medication prevention AF follow non-cardiac open-chest surgery well study , amiodarone study control trial prevention AF patient undergoing procedure . In addition , amiodarone associate side effect , important determine safety medication use patient population .</detailed_description>
