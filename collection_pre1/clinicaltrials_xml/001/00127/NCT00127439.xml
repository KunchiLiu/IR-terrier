	<brief_title>Effects Robotic Versus Manually-Assisted Locomotor Training Individuals With Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) one disable health problem face adult today , one consequence often inability walk difficulty walking . Recent study suggest intensive step training treadmill use body-weight support manual assistance provide repetitive task-specific sensory cue neural axis improve recovery walk person incomplete SCI . More recently , robotics develop alternative manually-assisted training . Robotic-assisted training may allow increased intensity training , improve reproducibility consistency training , reduce personnel need implement training . However , effect robotic-assisted training compare manually-assisted training know . An improved understanding differential effect mechanisms improvement walking facilitate continue advance evidenced-based practice neuro-rehabilitation , therefore improve treatment person SCI . The primary objective project ass compare effect robotic-assisted versus manually-assisted locomotor train use body-weight support ( BWS ) sub-tasks walking . Specifically , believe least four sub-tasks walk differentially affect robotic-assisted training compare manually-assisted training ( propulsion , transition stance step , step , equilibrium ) . The investigator hypothesize robotic-assisted training great effect improve propulsion , transition equilibrium . The effect two modality adaptability , fifth sub-task walking , unclear ; therefore , development component pilot project involve establish quantitative measure adaptability assess differential effect train . Participants randomize one two training group : robotic-assisted manually-assisted , evaluated performance sub-tasks walking .</detailed_description>
