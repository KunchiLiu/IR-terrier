	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer third large cause cancer mortality United States . The treatment metastatic colorectal cancer undergo rapid improvement . Currently , two major chemotherapy regimen , combine anti-angiogenesis treatment . These regimen 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) + irinotecan 5-FU + oxaliplatin . Each therapy roughly similar rate response , unclear specific therapy would benefit patient . The advent genome wide expression analysis provide tool analyze difference . In microarray analysis colon cancer outcome trial , sponsor National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Moffitt Cancer Center , patient newly diagnose metastatic colon cancer biopsied sample preserve ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) later . Patients randomize either one two state art regimen : capecitabine + irinotecan + avastin ( bevacizumab ) capecitabine + oxaliplatin + avastin . Response chemotherapy , time progression , overall survival end point trial . Once accrual patient meet , investigator compare genome wide expression pattern group .</detailed_description>
