	<brief_title>Investigating Impact Tailored Reports Anxiety Amongst Cancer Patients Their Confidants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : - Based randomised trial researcher aim model use leaflets home function three factor : 1. whether patient chose information choose ; 2. whether include personal information medical record ; 3. whether include anxiety management advice . - The researcher aim model patient confidant 's anxiety three month function three factor patient ' use leaflets home . Patient Population : Beatson Oncology Centre ( BOC ) . Patients think eligible identified outpatient appointment diary fifteen month . Medical record check initially identified ensure patient breast , gynaecological , prostate bladder testicular , select cancer head neck . Patients exclude : - receive palliative treatment , - knowledge understanding diagnosis ( ) , - visual mental handicap , - severe pain symptom cause distress , - medical nursing student , - take part trial possibly confound intervention , - give informed consent . Sample size : The researcher aim recruit 400 patient . This give 80 % power find difference 40 % 27 % improve anxiety ( eg ) 200 personalise group 200 general group . Recruitment : Eligible patient send letter explain study advise researcher approach visit BOC soon , seek participation study . Patients recruit bad news consultation soon possible thereafter point course contact treatment Beatson . At recruitment researcher explain study seek write consent . If patient consent researcher arrange time intervention give patient questionnaire take home complete questionnaire 'confidant ' . Baseline data : Patients ask bring complete questionnaire intervention consultation one week later . The questionnaire include following section : 1. previous computer information use , perceive knowledge , significant others provide emotional support , family live arrangement , 2. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) , 3. Miller Coping Style questionnaire , 4 . Helgeson 's measure social support negative interaction . Completion questionnaire take half hour home . Confidants : The researcher aim recruit 400 'confidants ' , one patient ( estimate likely recruit ( say ) 60 % 400 . Patients ask prepared pas baseline questionnaire person select person likely use seek emotional support . This may husband , wife , partner , may also daughter , son , friend . The confidant questionnaire section : 1. demographic relationship patient , newspaper read , frequency discussion patient , perceive knowledge 2 . HADS , 3 . Miller cop style . The researcher know proportion patient would prepare pas questionnaire response rate would receive confidant . Rees work daughter woman breast cancer find 93 % patient pass questionnaire 77 % daughter respond . If get overall 60 % response ( ie 240 questionnaire ) would give u 80 % power find difference 40 % 23 % improve anxiety ( eg ) 120 personalise group vs 120 general group . The confidant population would less patient population . Patients exclude correspond 'confidant ' . Randomisation three factor : After recruitment RA randomise three binary factor ( 2X2X2 factorial design ) : A. Interactive v Automatic ; B . Medical Record v General ; C. Anxiety reduce advice v advice . Patients randomise eight sub-groups block 32 separately breast v rest . The eight ( 2X2X2 ) subgroup , receive different style leaflet . These detailed . Baseline Data : Collected case note severity , length onset cancer , treatment far ( surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy ) , date birth , gender , address , deprivation category postcode patient , problem treatment list patient 'medical record ' group . Intervention : The delay recruitment intervention allow patient time think participation withdraw desire . At intervention , patient produce report cancer . Patients 'automatic group ' would need use computer . - Interactive v automatic . Those 'interactive ' group choose menu , see information screen , press 'add report ' button information screen information want include report . Patients ' choice record computer . - Those medical record group personal information include base medical record . They either information automatically select format computer , see screen choose want include . - Lastly , half patient additional section offering advice reduction anxiety . This section write base previous work cognitive behavioural therapy anxiety . All report include colour photo ( example treatment room , staff ) , diagram ( example , anatomical ) good quality printing etc . The patient give report take away . Three month follow-up : At three month patient send follow-up questionnaire follow section : 1. question satisfaction information receive , use report , interaction family friend , influence report interaction , perceive knowledge . 2 . HADS , 3 . Helgeson 's social support questionnaire . Significant others send questionnaire section : 1. question satisfaction information receive , 2 .

Analysis : The researcher produce CONSORT patient flow diagram compare loss follow-up three intervention ( A , B , C ) . Analysis outcomes patient complete intervention follow-up . The researcher focus follow : - Comparison outcomes 1-4 intervention A , B , C control age , gender , cancer site , time since diagnosis , severity , cop style , use analysis variance ( factorial design ) multiple logistic regression . - Comparison outcomes 5 6 intervention A , B , C ( qualitative ) . - Modelling anxiety ( outcome 1-2 ) use report home ( outcome 4 ) , perceive social support , intervention A , B , C . - Frequencies choice ( outcome 7 ) comparison automatic selection , statistically qualitative description difference . - Comparison patient NHS cost ( outcome 8 ) make method use trial method provide information . - Comparison anxiety change patient significant . - Analyses complete follow-up . No substitution data carry randomised complete follow-up . The researcher thus able make provisional conclusion different type information provision influence interaction , anxiety patient satisfaction , correlation use information family , anxiety ; The researcher information patient selection inform good development automatic system , cost inform practical deployment .</detailed_description>
