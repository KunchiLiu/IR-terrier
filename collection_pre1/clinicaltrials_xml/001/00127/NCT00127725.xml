	<brief_summary>Fractures tibial shaft ( diaphysis ) common long bone fracture . They frequently occur male less 40 year age . Despite advancement surgical management fracture , precarious blood supply lack soft-tissue cover shaft tibia make fracture vulnerable non-union infection . These complication often require multiple procedure , extend time work , result ongoing poor mobility . This reflect surgical revision rate scientific literature record 20 30 % . Pulsed electromagnetic field ( PEMF ) stimulation show safe effective treatment non-unions tibia . These fracture bone fail unite heal process cease . The PEMF deliver via device EBI Bone Healing System® , strap onto limb overlie fracture . It lightweight portable use rechargeable battery power . It compatible internal external fixation may also wear plaster fibreglass cast . It usually keep place ten hour per day use period three month fracture unites . In animal model , PEMF stimulation demonstrate improve time fracture heal acute fracture . There demonstrated side effect therapy . The study hypothesis PEMF stimulation first twelve week fracture , addition normal surgical care , increase union rate fracture thereby significantly reduce surgical revision rate within first twelve month follow fracture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : This randomize control study whose objective determine whether PEMF stimulation adjunct therapy clinically significant effect morbidity associate tibial shaft fracture . It two-armed study . The active treatment arm involve participant acute tibial shaft fracture randomize receive PEMF stimulation device worn fracture site 10 hour per day first twelve week injury . The control arm involve participant acute tibial shaft fracture randomize receive placebo device worn fracture site 10 hour per day first twelve week injury . Primary Aim : - To determine whether use PEMF stimulation device adjunct therapy acute tibial shaft fracture reduce surgical revision rate 12 month injury . Revision surgery purpose study define surgery injure leg ( knee joint ankle joint ) 14 day accident , except operation design provide initial skin coverage skin closure , removal external fixateur isolated procedure . Revision surgery classify minor major . Minor revision define dynamisation intramedullary nail percutaneous removal static locking screw . Major revision surgery include revision surgery define . Major revision surgery sub-classified procedure involve either bone grafting , and/or revision fixation , and/or treatment establish infection , amputation , rate compare across treatment placebo arm . Secondary Aims : - To determine whether use PEMF stimulation device adjunct therapy acute tibial shaft fracture increase radiological clinical union rate 12 , 26 52 week injury . A fracture deem radiologically united time independent observation , two orthopaedic consultant agree three bony cortex bridge bony callus anteroposterior lateral plain X-ray time . If two reviewer disagree , third opinion seek final . A fracture deem clinically united deem stable clinical examination treat orthopaedic surgeon time . - To determine whether use PEMF stimulation device adjunct therapy acute tibial shaft fracture increase patient ' general health score , measure SF-36 general health survey ; function injure limb , measure Lower Extremity Functional Scale 12 , 26 52 week injury . Primary Hypothesis : - That significantly low rate surgical revision within 12 month injury participant receive active PEMF stimulation first 12 week injury . Secondary Hypotheses : - That increase union rate 12 , 26 52 week fracture among participant receive active stimulation . - That average score general health survey region specific health survey high among participant receive active stimulation . Research Plan Study Population : All adult ( 18 year ) diaphyseal fracture tibia present recruiting hospital study period eligible enrol study . The AO classification 42 use define tibial shaft fracture . Any fracture extend articular surface exclude . From analysis previous Liverpool patient literature , investigator expect population 75 % - 85 % male average age 30-35 year old . There upper limit age . If participant sustain bilateral tibial shaft fracture , enrol separately , leave right . Eligible patient approach senior member treat team , either registrar consultant , give information sheet read opportunity question answer . They ask sign consent form would like participate study . Interpreters use process non-english speaking patient . There 14-day window period post injury device must apply patient enter study . If reason device apply time , patient exclude study . The commonly encountered reason investigator expect patient remain Intensive Care Unit 14 day , electrically sensitive equipment use patient care . Patients pacemaker defibrillator exclude , PEMF stimulation may affect type device . Patients pathological fracture due malignant tumour exclude . Pregnant patient exclude , device yet study pregnancy . Patients without cognitive ability consent exclude . The recruiting hospital Liverpool Hospital , St. George Hospital , Westmead Hospital , Nepean Hospital Wollongong Hospital . Approval grant study commence hospital ’ Human Research Ethics Committee . Recruitment patient commence Monday August 14 , 2005 , hospital . Recruitment end target 340 participant enrol study . Baseline Measures : Participants ask complete brief questionnaire enrolment determine potential risk factor non-union . These data age , smoking , general medical condition medication use . The participant ’ current occupation also seek may effect time take return work . The treat doctor ask complete questionnaire risk factor . This include detail mechanism injury , whether injury open close ( Gustillo grade open injury ) , injury participant sustain , treatment receive injury , well patient ' insurance status . The definitive treatment tibia fracture classify either external fixation cast ( plater paris fibreglass ) , intramedullary nailing , internal fixation plate screw , external fixation . Copies initial X-rays collect . The fracture classify nine fracture pattern define AO classification system panel three orthopaedic consultant experience trauma . Randomisation Process : After consent form sign baseline data collect , participant assign either active inactive arm NH &amp; MRC Clinical Trials Centre ( CTC ) locate Sydney University . Devices come pool seventy device , supply BiometÒ Australia commercially know EBI Bone Healing System® . Thirty-five device active thirty-five inactive , randomly number 1 70 CTC . The CTC code active inactive device conduct randomisation process use statistical technique minimisation , dynamic allocation process design balance know risk factor across treatment arm . The two factor minimise recruit hospital whether injury close open . A device randomly assign available pool either active inactive device , assign device fit patient . The researcher , company representative , surgeon patient remain blinded active/inactive arm data collect analysed . Interventions : Enrolment study affect aspect participant ' care . All participant undergo normal surgical intervention follow tibial shaft fracture injury recommend treat surgeon . After participant assign device number , sale representative BiometÒ Australia fit within three work day , either hospital ward participant ’ home . Participants receive instruction use device , require wear device ten hour per day period twelve week . The device manufacture record amount time use thereby measure compliance . Non-compliance defined average use less six hour per day . Participants also ask twelve week average use device . After twelve week research team company representative collect device , replace strap , clean check re-enter pool device assignment . Data Collection : Data collect 12 , 26 , 52 week participant treat surgeon . Participants receive survey mail , contact phone attain answer . On occasion ask whether procedure leg , hospital . At three month also ask average use device , whether see surgeon private room hospital clinic insurance status . That , treat medicare , private health insurance , worker compensation , third party insurance . They ask manage return work , complete Lower Extremity Functional Score well Short Form-36 ( general health survey ) . The phone questionnaire expect take 15-30 minute time . Their surgeon also contact 12 , 26 52 week determine surgery complication , gain opinion fracture union . Copies routine pre-operative twelve week X-rays collect review . Preoperative X-rays classify accord AO classification system 9 sub classification tibial shaft fracture panel three orthopaedic surgeon . Two orthopaedic surgeon experience trauma , remain blinded treatment arm patient , assess twelve-week X-rays determine union occur . Fracture union rate twelve week quantify . Fracture union define mature callus bridge three four cortex fracture site two radiographic view . If disagreement amongst two surgeon , X-rays shall review third surgeon whose opinion shall final . For fracture fail unite twelve week , surgeon contact determine union rate six month plain X-rays collect review . If undergone surgery , medical record operation report examine determine reason surgery exact operation undergone . This ascertain surgical revision rate union rate 12 , 26 52 week post injury . Potential Significance : If show effective , device may become common adjunct management tibia fracture significantly decrease rate revision surgery increase rate union see fracture . It may also consider use long bone fracture .</detailed_description>
