	<detailed_description>This double-blinded , randomize , placebo-controlled , crossover trial . Sixty patient identified physician muscle pain weakness statin therapy creatine kinase ( CK ) enzyme determination normal enrol voluntarily . All patient percutaneous muscle biopsy prior enrollment trial . These patient randomize blind crossover fashion either standardize statin therapy placebo eight week interval . After eight week drug placebo patient assess sign symptom muscle weakness : - Dynamometry grip hip strength - An exercise test exhale gas analysis - Blood test cholesterol , creatine kinase , lactate - Urine test organic acid Following first eight-week study test period , patient serve control enter second eight-week study period . During second phase take opposite therapy , either drug placebo , yet receive . Sub-studies include ten control never previously receive statin ten subject suffer statin-induced rhabdomyolysis . Subjects sub-studies expose statin therapy undergo limit testing .</detailed_description>
