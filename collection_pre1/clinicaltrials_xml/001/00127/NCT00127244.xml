	<brief_title>Study Comparing Two Different Methods Treating Periodontal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This application develop test follow hypothesis : A medical model periodontal therapy , compare traditional model , clinically effective , valuable , realistically implement clinical practice . To accomplish task prospective , blind , community base , cohort trial carry . Two analytical technique employ compare outcomes periodontal therapy : clinical effectiveness value . The two primary outcome variable assess clinical effectiveness clinician center ( attachment level ) patient center ( quality life ) . The key outcome variable value determination cost care . Value determine divide outcome cost care . Thus similar outcome reduce cost increase value . This facilitate calculate cost-effectiveness cost-utility care , prepare decision analysis tree , carry sensitivity analysis . There two significant reason test medical model care . If hypothesis correct : 1. would increase access periodontal care ; 2. would offer cost-effective method treat periodontal infection correlate systemic health problem . These point argue direct comparison medical traditional model care .</detailed_description>
