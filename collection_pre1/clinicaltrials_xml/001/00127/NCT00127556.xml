	<brief_summary>This study concern safety blood transfusion . Prior transfusion , staff perform number essential safety check ensure correct patient receive correct blood product . Evidence suggest safety check always do . This study design assess effect simple intervention performance bedside safety check . The hypothesis simple intervention improve performance bedside check .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The local collaborator participate hospital identify two clinical area comparable following element : similar hour service , similar use red cell , similar level intensity , similar nurse-to-patient staffing ratio . For purpose study , clinical area define discrete area one type clinical care take place . Comparability establish completion checklist . The local collaborator transmit comparability data study co-ordinator pas nominate medical consultant ( Professor Mike Murphy ) study statistician . If party satisfy two clinical area comparable , confirmation transmit local collaborator together authority commence two-week baseline audit . Once baseline complete local collaborator contact statistician , via co-ordinator , informed area intervention . The local collaborator inform blood bank intervention area . The intervention apply one clinical area ward participate hospital . Both clinical area audit two-week baseline observation period . The two area randomly allocate either intervention label blood bag intervention . Auditing carry area 2 week intervention introduce . To assess longer-term impact intervention , two-week period audit 8 week start intervention . The intervention carry full 10-week period . The randomized comparison base data collect 2-week period one area receive label bag , area observe observer length time . Thus effect intervention separate initial effect observer may bedside check practice . This comparison also make long-term audit data collect 8-weeks . The intervention investigation simple label apply blood bag way cover ( obstruct entry ) `` port '' use administer blood . The label apply unit crossmatched red cell . The position label require user remove label administer red cell . The label state : `` STOP : Check patient 's wristband '' . The wording translated appropriate language necessary . Observers ( auditor ) - blind test control area - ask audit bedside check time transfusion . This do direct observation . The auditor take position observe practice therefore obvious staff . However auditor participate transfusion check , answer question , reveal observed error check ( unless observe wrong blood transfuse , case intervene ) . Observations record data form . Participants invite Europe , North America , South America , Asia Australia . The target least 15 hospital .</detailed_description>
