	<detailed_description>Background : Worldwide intensive care physician consider administer systemic corticosteroid patient adverse clinical course suffer condition like acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) septic shock . Data recent small study perform patient unresolving ARDS ( 1 ; 2 ) suggest survival benefit associate rescue therapy relatively prolonged course corticosteroid . Treated patient show improved respiratory function , also hemodynamic status overall multiple organ dysfunction score . It suggest integrity hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may impair patient subset ( 3 ; 4 ) Objective ( ) : To evaluate safety effectiveness non-selective anti-inflammatory strategy , i.e . 6-methyl-prednisolone , persistent unresolving inflammatory state , i.e . multiple organ dysfunction syndrome , degree organ dysfunction mortality . Design : Multi-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled . Randomization data entry internet base ( htpp : //www.webnaif.com ) . Patients randomize computer-generated random-number table stratify center bloc 6 . Sample size , group 120 patient . The study power detect 20 % reduction mortality , 50 % 30 % 100 patient per study group 5 % significance level power 80 % . An additional 20 % ( n=20 ) per group plan compensate loss . Main Inclusion Criteria : - Patients establish , unresolving , refractory MODS , reversible treatable cause persistent MODS treat rule . - Patients endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation least 7 day . - Aggregate Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score ( 5 ) great 8 first seven day mechanical ventilation great 5 day inclusion . - Written inform consent participate trial sign next kin authorize person . Additional Inclusion Criteria : - Main cause disease admission : Adequate `` source control '' require refers optimal , complete , definitive surgical and/or medical therapy . - Infections : 1 . Infectious cause persistence MODS reasonably rule clinical ground ( infectious endocarditis , undrained abscess like sinusitis , empyema abdominal pu ) . Consider sampling culture broncho-alveolar lavage fluid , protect specimen brush ( empyema fluid , lung tissue ) order rule respiratory infection , well intra-vascular catheter change culture . 2 . Present previous infection , either document strongly suspect , treat least 3 day inclusion . - Supportive Care : Optimal hemodynamic , renal , hematologic , nutritional `` supportive care '' provide . Exclusion Criteria : - Decision provide full support . - Immune status steroid therapy . 1 . Steroid therapy - Currently indicate chronic concurrent disease ( meningitis , auto-immune disease , asthma , acute exacerbation COPD , ) . Inhaled steroid allow . - Administered current admission ( &gt; 20 mg/day 6-methyl-prednisolone equivalent &gt; 48 hour ) . - Chronic steroid therapy prior current admission ( &gt; 20 mg 6-methyl-prednisolone equivalent/day &gt; 1 month previous 3 month ) . 2 . Other immune-suppressive therapy within previous 6 month . 3 . Known AIDS . 4 . Neutropenia &lt; 500/mcl . 5 . Preceding organ transplantation . - Irreversible ultimately fatal clinical condition like metastatic malignant disease cardiogenic shock cause coronary artery disease . - Presence invasive fungal infection - Other significant pre-existing underlie chronic disease : 1 . Severe parenchymal liver disease ( Child-Pugh grade C ) 2 . Severe irreversible acute chronic central nervous system disease . 3 . Severe end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( home oxygen 1 exacerbation previous year ) 4 . End-stage renal disease ( Chronic dialysis ) . - Age le 18 year . - Pregnancy . - Morbid obesity : body mass index 40 . - Recent ( last 3 month ) upper GI hemorrhage . - Extensive burn ( &gt; 30 % BSA ) - Known allergy steroid . - Written inform consent available . Intervention : Intravenous administration 6-methyl-prednisolone placebo ( aqueous solution ) . The duration study medication administration protocol 32 day ( 1 ) : - Initial iv load dose 160 mg. - An iv bolus injection 6-methyl-prednisolone administer every 6 hour : 1 . 40 mg day 1 14 , 2 . 20 mg day 15 21 , 3 . 10 mg day 22 28 , 4 . 5 mg day 29 30 , 5 . 2.5 mg day 31 32 . Informed consent form information sheet review approved regional Ethics Committee Madrid ( 10 centre ) , local review board participate centre , Agencia Española del Medicamento ( Spanish Ministry Health ) . Ethical Approval : The study protocol approve regional Ethics Committee Madrid ( 10 centre ) , local review board participate centre , Agencia Española del Medicamento ( Spanish Ministry Health ) . Stopping Rules : The independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) real-time access main variable `` 28-day mortality '' ( allocation study group `` A '' `` B '' ) propose premature interruption trial base sequential analysis significant difference become apparent . The DMC perform 5 interim analysis , one every 48 include patient criterium use statistically significant difference level p &lt; 0,01 ( S.J . Pocock . Clinical Trials . A practical Approach . John Wiley &amp; Sons . New York . 1994 ) . Primary Endpoints : 1 . All cause ICU 28-day mortality 2 . Organ dysfunction score day 4 , 7 , 14 , 28 protocol . Planned Subgroup Analysis : No subgroup analysis plan . Side-effects Quantification : The investigator use NIH Toxicity Form scale 1 5 . Severe adverse event severely ill population precisely define require immediate ( le 24 hour ) communication study website . The DMC access variable define describe SAEs . Analysis Plan : Main comparison 28-day ICU mortality study group ( chi square test percentages log-rank test Kaplan-Meier survival curve . Multiple organ dysfunction score Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score compare baseline day 4 , 7 , 14 28 ( Student 's test and/or non-parametric test ) . Independent risk factor mortality study multivariate analysis ( Cox regression ) significant comparison univariate analysis . Analysis sample accord principle intention treat . Finishing Date : The finishing date 18 month first inclusion centre . Scheduled begin trial August 2005 Reporting Date : First trimester 2007 .
