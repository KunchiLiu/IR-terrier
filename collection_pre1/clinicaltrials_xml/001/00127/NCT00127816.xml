	<brief_summary>Permanent prostate implant type radiation therapy high dose radiation deliver cancerous tissue many small radioactive `` seed '' . Studies early-stage prostate cancer patient treat way follow 10 - 12 year indicate cure rate 80 % . This result similar surgery form radiotherapy , come few side effect great convenience patient . Further study show radiation dose deliver important factor achieve cure . At present dose estimate computer , use compute tomography ( CT ) scan patient simple calculation method . The dose estimate accurate could , however , precise extent prostate hard determine CT scan , calculation method make use information patient body tissue . The researcher propose eliminate inaccuracy use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) identify prostate gland develop improve dose calculation algorithm include information patient tissue . This new approach allow physician assess implant quality great certainty , improve implant technique , ultimately increase cure rate much 95 % .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study address three major source post-implant dosimetry inaccuracy permanent prostate implant : post-operative edema , prostate contour delineation , dose calculation method . It hypothesize pragmatic edema model minimize first uncertainty , co-registered CT + MR image second , improve dose calculation algorithm third . Detailed objective : - measure model effect edema dosimetry ; - evaluate CT + MR image registration method ; - compare dosimetry CT alone vs. CT + MRI use contemporary TG-43 dose calculation method ; - set Monte Carlo code make full use information CT + MR image perform implant dose calculation ; - compare prostate dosimetry Monte Carlo vs. simple TG-43 method ; - develop analytical post-implant dose calculation algorithm routine clinical use ( Monte Carlo slow single-CPU brachytherapy planning computer ) ; finally - ass performance new algorithm . Of estimate 250,000 new case prostate cancer North America 2004 , early stage disease consequence PSA testing . Permanent prostate implant therapy major option group , long-term clinical study indicate cure rate equal surgery external beam radiotherapy , few complication . By deal dosimetric inaccuracy , proven treatment reach full potential .</detailed_description>
