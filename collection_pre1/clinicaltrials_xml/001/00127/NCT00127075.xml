	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) affect 1 1000 people western country , mainly woman childbearing year . It autoimmune disease central nervous system ( CNS ) , result chronic focal inflammatory response subsequent demyelination axonal loss . Recent prospective study report significant decline two-thirds rate relapse third trim pregnancy significant increase two-thirds first three month post-partum comparison relapse rate observe year prior pregnancy ( Confavreux et al. , 1998 ) . These dramatic change relapse rate occur time impregnation many substance ( among , sexual steroid ) high , dramatic decline pre-pregnancy level , immediately follow delivery . It may hypothesize sexual steroid could exert beneficial effect modulation immune state lower pro-inflammatory lymphocyte response Th1 type enhancement anti-inflammatory response Th2 type . They may also play direct role remyelination central nervous system lesion , peripheral nervous system . The POPART'MUS study European , multicentre , randomize , placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial , aim prevent MS relapse relate post-partum condition , administer high dos progestin ( nomegestrol acetate ) , combination endometrial protective dos estradiol . Treatment give immediately delivery continuously first three month post-partum . Assuming result trial positive , new treatment could consider relapsing-remitting phase disease woman afar pregnancy post-partum .</brief_summary>
