	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make gene-modified virus may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well vaccine therapy work treat patient stage II , stage III , stage IV ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine remission rate patient NY-ESO-1 LAGE-1 expressing stage II-IV ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer still complete clinical remission 12 month initial documentation remission treat vaccine therapy comprise vaccinia-NY-ESO-1 vaccine fowlpox-NY-ESO-1 vaccine . Secondary - Determine NY-ESO-1 specific cellular humoral immunity , evaluate NY-ESO-1 specific antibody CD8+ T cell induced regimen , patient . - Correlate time treatment failure vaccine-induced NY-ESO-1 antigen specific cellular humoral immunity patient . - Determine safety regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive vaccinia-NY-ESO-1 vaccine intradermally day 1 fowlpox-NY-ESO-1 vaccine subcutaneously day 29 , 57 , 85 , 113 , 141 , 169 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , every 2 month 1 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22 patient accrue study within 14-36 month .</detailed_description>
