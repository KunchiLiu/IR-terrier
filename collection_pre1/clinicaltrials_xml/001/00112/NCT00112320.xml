	<brief_summary>Repair tetralogy Fallot ( TOF ) , common form cyanotic congenital heart disease , usually involve surgery outflow right ventricle ( RV ) pulmonary valve order relieve obstruction blood flow RV lung . This procedure often lead regurgitation ( leakage ) pulmonary valve , put burden handle large normal amount blood flow RV . Over year , extra burden lead enlargement RV decrease function . Treatment often include surgical insertion replacement new pulmonary valve . Replacement damage pulmonary valve aim minimize leakage help RV function well . This study design compare two method operation ( call pulmonary valve replacement [ PVR ] ) perform . In first method , new valve insert area old valve operate ; standard PVR . The second method involve insert new valve way standard method , addition , area right ventricular wall scar function well remove ( PVR plus right ventricular remodel ) . This study evaluate method effective base size function RV measure cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) six month follow surgery , compare size function operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Surgical repair TOF often result chronic pulmonary regurgitation ( PR ) associate RV dilatation dysfunction . Mounting evidence indicate PR lead significant long-term morbidity mortality , include arrhythmia , sudden death , right heart failure . Using CMR , high prevalence regional dysfunction aneurysm RV patient repair TOF . Current standard clinical practice patient repair TOF , severe PR , ventricular dysfunction , and/or clinical deterioration insert bioprosthetic pulmonary valve reduce volume load RV . Although PVR achieve low mortality , research show persistent worsen RV dysfunction postoperatively , despite competent pulmonary valve . In patient left ventricular ( LV ) aneurysm , surgical remodel aneurysm resection show improve LV mechanic . In view potentially deleterious effect aneurysmal akinetic wall segment RV mechanic , researcher recently modify PVR surgical technique select patient include surgical remodel RV resection akinetic wall segment . However , study systematically compare efficacy PVR plus surgical RV remodel PVR alone . Research Question : Is difference two surgical strategies—PVR alone ( bioprosthetic pulmonary valve insertion , present , resection right ventricular outflow tract [ RVOT ] aneurysm ) versus PVR surgical RV remodeling ( bioprosthetic pulmonary valve insertion resection akinetic scar area anterior RV wall reduce RV volume ) —on RV mechanic incidence adverse event patient repair TOF chronic pulmonary regurgitation ?</detailed_description>
