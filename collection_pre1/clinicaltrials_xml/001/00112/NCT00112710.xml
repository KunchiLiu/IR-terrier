	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , cisplatin , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether give gemcitabine together cisplatin effective give gemcitabine together carboplatin treat non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study gemcitabine cisplatin see well work compare gemcitabine carboplatin treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Combination With Either Cisplatin Carboplatin Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare efficacy gemcitabine combination 2 different dos cisplatin vs carboplatin , term survival time , patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - Compare symptom control quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare response patient treat regimen . - Compare dose intensity regimens patient . - Compare ratio course treatment give in-patient vs out-patient patient . - Compare intensity number duration toxic episodes patient treat regimen . - Compare cost cost-effectiveness regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord WHO performance status ( 0 vs 1 2 ) , disease stage ( IIIB v IV ) , participate center . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine arm I cisplatin ( low dose arm I ) IV 1 hour day 1 . - Arm III : Patients receive gemcitabine arm I carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course . Patients reassess 2 course . Patients respond disease stable disease symptom improvement receive 2 additional course therapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression stable disease without symptom improvement remove study . Quality life assess baseline , day 1 course 2-4 , completion study treatment , monthly 6 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 6 month periodically thereafter survival . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,350 patient ( 450 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 6 year .</detailed_description>
