	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Effectiveness OPTIMIZER System Subjects With Heart Failure : FIX-HF-5</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IMPULSE Dynamics ' FIX HF 5 US Study prospective , multi-center , study evaluate safety efficacy cardiac contractility modulation ( CCM ) signal deliver implantable OPTIMIZER™ System patient NYHA class III/IV heart failure . The study involve recruitment approximately 420 subject total 50 site nationwide . Those subject fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion base upon baseline test result randomize receive OPTIMIZER™ System control group . All subject randomize follow 1 year shall receive study related assessment throughout course study . In addition , subject continue receive optimal medical therapy treatment heart failure . The primary efficacy assessment consist change exercise tolerance measure cardiopulmonary exercise test baseline 6 month . Safety variable , rate cause hospitalization death , shall collect group shall compare 12 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects 18 year age old Subjects either male female Subjects baseline ejection fraction 35 % less echocardiography . Subjects treat heart failure least 90 day ( include treatment βblocker least 90 day unless patient intolerant ) New York Heart Association functional Class III IV time enrollment . Subjects receive appropriate , stable medical therapy 30 day prior enrollment treatment heart failure , consist appropriate dos diuretic , ACEinhibitor angiotensin II receptor blocker βblocker . Stable define 100 % increase 50 % decrease dose . Subjects , opinion Principle Investigator ( base current guideline clinical practice ) , clinical indication implant cardiac defibrillator ( ICD ) and/or pacemaker , must exist device agree undergo implantation device unless patient refuse undergo implantation device personal reason . Subjects willing able return followup visit . Subjects whose baseline VO2 , max &lt; 9 ml 02/min/kg . Subjects potentially correctible cause heart failure , valvular heart disease congenital heart disease . Subjects clinically significant angina pectoris , consist angina daily life ( i.e. , Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina score II ) , episode unstable angina within 30 day enrollment , angina and/or electrocardiography ( ECG ) change exercise test perform baseline evaluation . Subjects hospitalize heart failure require use inotropic support within 30 day enrollment . Subjects clinically significant amount ambient ectopy , define 8,900 premature ventricular complex ( PVCs ) per 24 hour baseline Holter monitoring . Subjects chronic atrial fibrillation chronic atrial flutter cardioverted within 30 day enrollment . Subjects whose exercise tolerance limited condition heart failure ( e.g. , angina , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ COPD ] , peripheral vascular disease , orthopedic rheumatologic condition ) unable participate 6minute walk cardiopulmonary stress test . Subjects schedule coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) procedure , undergone CABG procedure within 90 day PTCA procedure within 30 day enrollment . Subjects biventricular pace system accept indication device . Subjects myocardial infarction within 90 day enrollment . Subjects mechanical tricuspid aortic valve . Subjects prior heart transplant . Subjects participate another experimental protocol . Subjects unable provide inform consent .</criteria>
