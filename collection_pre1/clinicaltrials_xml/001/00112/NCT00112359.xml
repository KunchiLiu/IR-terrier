	<brief_title>International Safety Efficacy Study Aztreonam Inhalation Solution ( AZLI ) Cystic Fibrosis Patients With P. Aeruginosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CF patient often lung infection occur repeatedly worsen time . The lung infection often cause bacteria call Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) . Treatment antibiotic stop slow growth bacteria . The antibiotic may give mouth , intravenously ( IV ) , inhalation mist . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy AZLI , investigational formulation antibiotic aztreonam administer TID use PARI eFlowÂ® electronic nebulizer , CF patient PA . In study , participant eligibility assess screen visit 7 14 day prior baseline visit ( Day 0 ) . Those participant continue meet eligibility criterion Day 0 randomize begin 28-day course blind study treatment ( AZLI TID placebo TID ) .
