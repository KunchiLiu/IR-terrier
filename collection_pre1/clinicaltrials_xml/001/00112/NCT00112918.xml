	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab ( Bv ) may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether give combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab effective combination chemotherapy alone treat colon cancer adjuvant setting . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study two different combination chemotherapy regimens without bevacizumab compare well work treat patient undergone surgery high risk stage II stage III colon cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery High Risk Stage II Stage III Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label Phase III , multicenter , multinational , randomize , 3-arm study design evaluate efficacy safety bevacizumab combination either intermittent fluorouracil/leucovorin oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX4 ) capecitabine plus oxaliplatin ( XELOX ) versus FOLFOX4 regimen alone , adjuvant chemotherapy colon carcinoma . The treatment phase consist two part 24 week total 48 week . The first part ( week 1 24 ) consist treatment either FOLFOX4 , FOLFOX4 combination bevacizumab , XELOX combination bevacizumab . The second part ( week 25 48 ) consist single-agent bevacizumab patient randomize either bevacizumab-containing arm , observation period patient assign FOLFOX4-alone arm . Patients follow recurrence/new occurrence colorectal cancer survival . Patients experience confirmed recurrence , occurrence new colorectal cancer therapy , experience unacceptable toxicity take study treatment remain study follow-up . Patients come therapy due confirm recurrence/appearance new colorectal cancer , follow survival end study follow-up period . The primary analysis perform 36 month last patient randomize . After primary analysis , patient continue follow survival least 2 year ie , patient followed-up least 5 year follow randomization .</detailed_description>

The patient candidate ( neo ) adjuvant radiotherapy . Note : Stage II patient consider highrisk patient fulfil one follow criterion : T4 tumour , Patients present bowel obstruction perforation , Histological sign vascular invasion ( i.e . blood lymphatic vessel ) perineural invasion , Patients age less 50 year , Patients suboptimal surgery ( le 12 node analyze ) . 5 . Curative surgery le 4 8 week prior randomization . 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . 7 . Life expectancy ≥ 5 year . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Macroscopic microscopic evidence remain tumour . Patients never evidence metastatic disease ( include presence tumour cell ascites ) . The isolated finding cytokeratin positive cell bone marrow consider evidence metastatic disease purpose study . 2 . Carcinoembryonic antigen &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) surgery ( screen period ) . 3 . For patient colostomy , unwilling delay revision least 28 day treatment completion . 4 . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior study treatment start , fully heal wound , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . Any central venous access device ( CVAD ) chemotherapy administration must insert least 2 day prior treatment start . 5 .
