	<brief_title>MDX-010 Treating Patients With Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine clinical response ( partial complete response ) patient unresectable stage IV ( locally distantly metastatic ) pancreatic adenocarcinoma treat anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody ( MDX-010 ) . Secondary - Determine whether observed response correlate incidence autoimmunity patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients stratify accord status disease ( locally vs distantly metastatic ) . Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody ( MDX-010 ) IV 90 minute day 0 , 21 , 42 , 63 . Treatment repeat every 84 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression achieve partial response complete response receive 2 additional course therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 42-82 patient ( 21-41 per stratum ) accrue study within 2-4 year .</detailed_description>
