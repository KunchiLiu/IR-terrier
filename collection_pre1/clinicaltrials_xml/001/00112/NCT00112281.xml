	<brief_summary>Tilarginine Acetate Injection new type drug temporarily stop body make bodily substance call nitric oxide . The body may produce excess nitric oxide follow severe heart damage lead shock . During heart attack , especially block artery cause heart attack reopen , large amount nitric oxide release heart muscle blood . Normally small amount nitric oxide good heart blood vessel . However , release large amount , heart attack , may harmful , add damage heart attack lower heart ’ ability pump blood body . It may cause blood pressure lower reduce amount blood flow body ’ vital organ . This may interfere body ’ organ able work . If Tilarginine Acetate Injection stop extra nitric oxide make , performance heart blood flow organ may get good , may result improvement symptom . The purpose study ( TRIUMPH ) investigate safety effectiveness Tilarginine Acetate Injection compare placebo ( inactive fluid effect body look exactly like medication study ) . The study help determine whether Tilarginine Acetate Injection , temporarily lower amount nitric oxide release vital organ improve blood pressure blood flow body ’ organ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy Nitric Oxide Reduction Patients With Cardiogenic Shock After Heart Attack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimate 120,000 160,000 patient annually diagnose cardiogenic shock ( CS ) North America Europe . CS complicate approximately 5-14 % case acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) common cause death patient hospitalize AMI . Cardiogenic shock develop course AMI end result pathophysiological cycle secondary sudden significant decrease cardiac contractility due infarction , ischemia , stun large myocardial segment . It anticipate advance reperfusion revascularization therapy significant additional impact survival patient CS . Modalities protect myocardium ischemia reperfusion likely next major advance improve outcome set acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) , especially patient large infarct complicate shock . Preliminary study investigate nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) inhibition suggest improvement cardiovascular function survival possible limit formation toxic NO . The primary objective TRIUMPH study establish efficacy Tilarginine Acetate Injection compare placebo reduce cause mortality 30 day post randomization patient cardiogenic shock complicate acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Safety objectives study include evaluation adverse event serious adverse event , key laboratory parameter .</detailed_description>
