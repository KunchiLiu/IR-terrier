	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Cancer Urinary Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy ( response rate stable disease rate ) Bay 439006 give patient advance metastatic urothelial cancer . II . To assess toxicity , time progression response duration Bay 439006 give patient advance metastatic urothelial cancer . III . To measure Ras mutational status EGFR/HER2 archival specimen . To determine baseline post-treatment level pERK , pAKT , VEGFR2 , CD31 , Ki-67/MIB-1 , cleave caspase 3 explore relationship correlative endpoint clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 3 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
