	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose CCI-779 bevacizumab see well work treat patient metastatic unresectable kidney cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , CCI-779 , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some find tumor cell kill carry tumor-killing substance . Others interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bevacizumab may also stop growth kidney cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving CCI-779 together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend dose combination CCI-779 Bevacizumab patient metastatic renal cell cancer . ( Phase I ) II . To determine proportion patient metastatic renal cell cancer progression free 6 month . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity combination CCI 779 Bevacizumab patient metastatic renal cell cancer . ( Phase II ) II . To determine clinical response rate CCI 779 Bevacizumab patient metastatic renal cell cancer . ( Phase II ) III . To determine time progression ( TTP ) , disease free survival , overall survival CCI 779 Bevacizumab patient metastatic renal cell cancer . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify predictive molecular marker response , tumor level plasma/serum level , exploratory manner . II . To correlate blood marker angiogenesis clinical activity combination CCI-779 Bevacizumab . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients stratify accord study phase ( I vs II ) . Phase I : Patients receive CCI-779 IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 bevacizumab IV day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos CCI-779 bevacizumab maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Phase II : Patients receive CCI-779 bevacizumab phase I MTD determine phase I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 3 year study entry .</detailed_description>
