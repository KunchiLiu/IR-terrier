	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth pancreatic cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together gemcitabine oxaliplatin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together gemcitabine oxaliplatin work treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine 6-month survival patient metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas treat bevacizumab , gemcitabine , oxaliplatin . Secondary - Determine objective response rate patient measurable disease treat regimen . - Determine median survival , progression-free survival , time treatment failure , overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive gemcitabine IV 100 minute bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV 120 minute day 2 16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 course therapy beyond CR . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
