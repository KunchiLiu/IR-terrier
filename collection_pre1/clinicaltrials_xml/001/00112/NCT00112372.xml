	<brief_title>Study Oral Ridaforolimus ( AP23573 , MK-8669 ) Treat Patients With Refractory Advanced Malignancies ( MK-8669-016 AM4 ) ( COMPLETED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The advent oral anticancer therapy create mean reduce dependency system treat cancer rely hospital-based service administer treatment . While know disadvantage oral therapy potential variable absorption , unpredictable bioavailability sometimes poor patient compliance pose challenge , use orally administer compound permit investigation alternative vary dose regimen , may ultimately enhance overall patient care . Ridaforolimus currently study phase 1 phase II clinical trial patient advance cancer . Thus far , trial demonstrate ridaforolimus favorable safety profile possess anticancer activity administer 30-minute intravenous ( IV ) infusion daily x 5 every-two-weeks weekly schedule . The primary objective current phase I trial study safety tolerability orally administer dosage form ridaforolimus . This accomplish ascend dose study several dosage regimens patient advanced malignancy .</detailed_description>
