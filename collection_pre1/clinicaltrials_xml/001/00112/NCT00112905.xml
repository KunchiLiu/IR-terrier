	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Regional Metastatic Cancer Urothelium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 4-month progression-free survival rate , response rate toxicity BAY 43-9006 patient progress regional metastatic transitional cell carcinoma ( mixed histology contain component TCC ) urothelium progress one one prior systemic chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time disease progression overall survival BAY 43-9006 . II . To evaluate frequency polymorphisms drug metabolize enzyme correlate polymorphisms variation BAY 43-9006 pharmacokinetics . III . To evaluate frequency raf kinase mutation tumor specimen correlate response rate . IV . To evaluate serum VEGF level potential marker angiogenesis inhibition BAY 43-9006 . V. To evaluate marker apoptosis kinase inhibition peripheral blood mononuclear cell potential biomarkers BAY 43-9006 activity . VI . To determine protein differentially translate genome patient respond treatment BAY 43-9006 versus patient respond BAY 43-9006 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-56 . Courses repeat every 56 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year study entry every 6 month 3 year study entry .</detailed_description>
