	<brief_title>Cilengitide Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery Recurrent Progressive Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 6-month progression-free survival rate operative patient recurrent progressive glioblastoma multiforme treat cilengitide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment group preoperative treatment component . Preoperative Treatment Group I : Patients receive high-dose cilengitide IV 1 hour day -8 , -4 , -1 . Preoperative Treatment Group II : Patients receive low-dose cilengitide IV 1 hour day -8 , -4 , -1 . Resection : All patient undergo tumor resection day 0 . Postoperative Treatment : Beginning within 2 week surgery , patient receive high-dose cilengitide IV 1 hour twice weekly 4 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 44 patient ( 22 per preoperative treatment group ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
