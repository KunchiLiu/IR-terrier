	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Melphalan , chemotherapeutic agent , find effective treatment choice destroy myeloma cell , especially give high ( bone marrow ablative ) dose . Total marrow irradiation ( TMI ) /ablative dose radiation therapy another modality capable destroy myeloma cell . Autologous peripheral blood/stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) give either melphalan follow TMI ( aim bone marrow contain area skeleton , site origin myeloma cell ) shorten duration/alleviate severity melphalan marrow irradiation-associated side effect . Lenalidomide , effective agent right treatment myeloma , show enhance beneficial effect autologous stem cell transplant give maintenance therapy . PURPOSE : This previously phase I trial establish maximum tolerate dose TMI 1600 cGy . The phase II part study ongoing study effect high-dose melphalan ASCT , follow TMI second ASCT , subsequent maintenance lenalidomide . The study conduct patient stag I-III myeloma , specific emphasis assess complete good partial response rate conversion , progression-free overall survival , safety/feasibility delivering plan treatment regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility toxicity tandem cycle ablative therapy consist first high-dose melphalan escalate dos fractionate total marrow irradiation ( TMI ) use helical tomotherapy patient advance multiple myeloma . II . To establish maximum tolerate dose TMI use helical tomotherapy . III . To assess response rate , progression free over-all survival follow treatment tandem cycle ablative therapy consist first high-dose melphalan escalate dos TMI use helical tomotherapy Dexamethasone/Thalidomide maintenance therapy patient advance multiple myeloma . IV . To assess feasibility add decadron thalidomide maintenance follow second cycle high-dose therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform cytogenetic , gene rearrangement , fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) study baseline post-treatment bone marrow blood specimen correlate presence/persistence feature treatment outcome . II . To bank/develop cell line develop future investigation tumor biology , potential assessment efficacy novel therapeutic agent . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study total marrow irradiation ( TMI ) . PRIMING AND APHERESIS : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 2 hour . Patients also receive filgrastim IV subcutaneously daily begin 24 hour administration cyclophosphamide continue apheresis complete . Patients undergo apheresis adequate number peripheral blood stem cell collect . ABLATIVE THERAPY : Course 1 : Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV 30 minute day -2 -1 . Patients undergo autologous PBSC transplantation day 0 receive filgrastim IV subcutaneously begin day 5 continue blood count recover . Course 2 : Beginning 6-18 week later , patient undergo TMI twice daily day -4 -1 . Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant receive filgrastim IV subcutaneously begin day 5 continue blood count recover . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning within 6-8 week day 0 course 2 ( TMI ) , patient receive oral lenalidomide daily . Courses repeat every 28 day approximately 3 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 6 month 1 year , annually least 2 year .</detailed_description>
