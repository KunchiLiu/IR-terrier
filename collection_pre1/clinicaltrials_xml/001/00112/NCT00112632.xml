	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine radiographic objective response rate patient locally advance gastrointestinal stromal tumor treat neoadjuvant imatinib mesylate . - Determine histological response patient treated drug . Secondary - Determine R0-resectability organ-preserving resectability patient treatment drug . - Correlate radiographic image metabolic image histological response patient treated drug . - Determine safety tolerability drug patient . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily 4-6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 2-3 week completion imatinib mesylate , patient respond stable disease undergo surgical resection . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , 6 month , 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
