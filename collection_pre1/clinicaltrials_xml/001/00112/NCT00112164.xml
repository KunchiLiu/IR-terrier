	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The hypothesis procoagulant inflammatory mechanism may dual role tissue injury test phase III clinical trial recombinant Xigris severe sepsis ( Bernard , 2001 ) . There significant reduction mortality 30 % 24 % patient treated Xigris . However , information effect Xigris patient sepsis co-existing ALI . Because Xigris known anti-coagulant anti-inflammatory property , plausible may effective treat patient ALI pulmonary non-pulmonary infectious cause . There also good rationale hypothesis Xigris may effective treat ALI non-infectious cause . In experimental lung injury , non-infectious cause , hyperoxia like acid-lung injury , pro-coagulant mechanism play role pathogenesis ALI ( Eitzman , 1996 ; Barazzone , 1996 ) . Furthermore , research show plasma-protein C deficiency occur almost patient ALI , reduce Protein C level associate high mortality non-pulmonary organ system dysfunction , even patient non-septic cause ALI ( Ware , 2003 ) . Elevated level thrombomodulin , product endothelial injury , measure plasma patient ALI regardless clinical disorder associate lung injury . The elevation thrombomodulin much high edema fluid plasma , suggest local activation release thrombomodulin occur , probably epithelial endothelial source lung , support hypothesis common pathway lung injury may occur septic non-septic cause ALI . In addition , considerable evidence normal fibrinolytic mechanism impair alveolar compartment patient ALI . Elevated level plasminogen-activator-inhbitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) plasma pulmonary edema fluid predictive value identify patient ALI likely die survive , regardless clinical risk factor predispose development ALI ( Prabhakaran , 2003 ) . Thus , support rationale test Xigris treatment patient ALI , regardless clinical disorder associate cause lung injury . Since Xigris anti-coagulant anti-inflammatory property ( Esmon , 2000 ; Grey , 1994 ) , treatment could reverse intravascular extravascular lung injury allow lung epithelial endothelial barrier recover functional breakdown barrier . This study evaluate effect treatment biochemical marker alveolar epithelial injury . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Participants randomly assign receive either Xigris saline placebo , administer continuously 96 hour . Participants follow 28 day , regardless whether drug stop adverse event , participant physician decide stop drug , participant discharge hospital unassisted breathing , death .</detailed_description>
