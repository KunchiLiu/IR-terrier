	<brief_summary>This study prospective , randomized study patient single ventricle heart disease undergo superior cavo-pulmonary anastomosis , `` Glenn '' operation . Such patient historically undergone cardiac catheterization ensure suitability procedure . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( cardiac MRI ) new technology provide excellent anatomic functional image heart . This study design demonstrate hypothesis cardiac magnetic resonance image provide comparable information catheterization , less side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomized study patient single ventricle congenital heart disease present superior cavo-pulmonary anastomosis , `` Glenn '' operation . Such patient past routinely undergone pre-operative invasive cardiac catheterization ass anatomic hemodynamic suitability procedure . Recent retrospective review , include ( J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2003 : July ; 126 ( 1 ) :272-81 ) suggest catheterization may benefit many patient , non-invasive assessment may allow adequate evaluation avoid many ( typically minor ) complication see cardiac catheterization high risk group infant . Cardiac MRI non-invasive imaging modality deliver superior anatomic information ( vascular intracardiac anatomy ) well functional data ( ventricular volume ejection fraction ) , may safe alternative catheterization patient . In study , patient undergo screen echocardiogram prior enrollment study assess degree risk operation ( pulmonary vein obstruction , clear risk factor poor outcome ) demonstrate need catheterization intervention ( aortic arch obstruction require balloon dilation ) ; patient low risk echocardiogram whose parent grant inform consent study randomize prospective fashion cardiac MRI cardiac catheterization . The finding study review subject 's cardiologist cardiac surgeon ; patient pre-operative information may cross another study deem necessary ( catheterization patient unsuspected find noted , cardiac MRI patient functional data may desire ) . Patients follow detail hospital stay ( include hospital length stay , complication , hospital charge ) pre-operative testing , well operative post-operative outcome ( new/missed diagnosis , hospital stay , operative post-operative complication , achievement clinical definition `` good '' outcome Glenn operation ) .</detailed_description>
