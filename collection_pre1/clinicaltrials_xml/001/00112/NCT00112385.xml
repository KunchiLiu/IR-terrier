	<brief_summary>The purpose study obtain preliminary data regard safety tolerability etanercept DM . In addition , use study ass variability , reliability , responsiveness core set outcome measure recommend IMACS . The study perform aegis Muscle Study Group ( MSG ) , consist experienced investigator avid interest myopathy . The ultimate goal pilot study obtain necessary , prerequisite information important designing future therapeutic trial etanercept agent patient DM . The specific aim study : Aim 1 : To preliminarily assess safety tolerability etanercept patient DM . Aim 2 : To assess safety tolerability prednisone dose schedule propose use . Aim 3 : To evaluate outcome measure recommend IMACS ass variability , reliability , responsiveness order facilitate design future therapeutic trial inflammatory myopathy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Etanercept Dermatomyositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dermatomyositis ( DM ) one major subtypes idiopathic inflammatory myopathy . Prednisone initial treatment choice patient DM . However , high rate patient disable weakness despite treatment prednisone , long-term side effect prednisone , many side effect associate second-line immunosuppressive agent ( e.g. , methotrexate , azathioprine ) , good treatment option need . There evidence tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) play role pathogenesis DM . Thus , etanercept , block TNF-a , logical drug ass DM . Etanercept associate number side effect include increase risk infection , induce autoimmune disease , perhaps cancer . These risk may enhance DM frequency autoimmune disorder ( e.g. , connective tissue disease ) malignancy already increase . The goal pilot study assess safety tolerability etanercept DM.We perform double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study etanercept 40 patient DM randomize 3:1 ratio receive etanercept placebo . All newly diagnose untreated patient start standard dose prednisone taper schedule . Refractory patient currently treat prednisone , IVIG , methotrexate also participate . Subjects follow 1 year assess various outcome variable recommend The International Myositis Assessment Clinical Study Group ( IMACS ) . The primary aim study preliminarily assess safety tolerability etanercept patient DM . We hypothesize etanercept safe well tolerated population . The second aim ass safety tolerability prednisone dose schedule propose use . We hypothesize patient able tolerate reduction prednisone dosage able completely weaned medication . We believe find relationship prednisone dosage related side effect . The third aim study assess variability , reliability , responsiveness outcome measure recommend IMACS use pilot study etanercept vehicle . The information gain study necessary order design large therapeutic trial etanercept drug dermatomyositis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study subject must meet following criterion : 1 . Meet diagnostic criterion DM ( ac ; , b , ; , c , ) 1 . Subjects must symmetric proximal great distal weakness 2 . Characteristic DM rash consist follow : heliotrope , shawl sign , Vsign , Gottron 's sign , Gottron 's papule , periungual telangiectasias 3 . Laboratory evidence myopathy least one following : elevate serum CK aldolase level , myositisspecific antibody , electromyography ( EMG ) demonstrate myopathic feature ( e.g. , muscle membrane instability , myopathic unit , early recruitment ) , abnormal skeletal muscle MRI showing diffuse patchy edema within muscle . 4 . A muscle biopsy optional patient fulfills criteria ac . The subject must demonstrate symmetric proximal weakness ( criterion ) entry study . If subject definite rash ( criterion b ) laboratory evidence myopathy ( criterion c ) , muscle biopsy require .
