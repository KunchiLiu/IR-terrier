	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming , grow , come back . The use eculizumab may prevent leukemia stop destruction red blood cell patient paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well eculizumab work treat patient paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eculizumab Treating Patients With Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety eculizumab patient transfusion-dependent hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria . - Determine efficacy drug , term hemoglobin stabilization number pack red blood cell unit transfuse 26-week treatment period , patient . Secondary - Compare occurrence transfusion avoidance , hemolysis ( measure lactate dehydrogenase [ LDH ] area curve ) , change fatigue 26-week treatment period patient treated drug v placebo . - Compare LDH change , quality life change , thrombosis , platelet activity , nitric oxide , free hemoglobin measure 26-week treatment period patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord number pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) unit transfuse 1 year prior screening ( &lt; 15 unit vs 15-25 unit vs &gt; 25 unit ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Within 10 day PRBC transfusion ( administer study observation period ) , patient receive placebo IV 30 minute week 5 week every 2 week 21 week . - Arm II : Within 10 day PRBC transfusion ( administer study observation period ) , patient receive eculizumab IV 30 minute week 5 week every 2 week 21 week . Quality life assess baseline ; week 0-4 , 12 , 20 , 26 study treatment ; week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 completion study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 75 patient ( 37 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
