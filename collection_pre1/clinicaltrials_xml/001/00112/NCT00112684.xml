	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose alvocidib treat patient locally advance metastatic solid tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , alvocidib , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Alvocidib may also stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . It may also stop growth solid tumor block blood flow tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity profile dose-limiting toxicity flavopiridol ( alvocidib ) patient locally advance metastatic solid tumor . II . Determine maximum tolerate dose drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug patient . II . Determine immunomodulatory effect drug patient . III . Determine pharmacogenomics drug , use peripheral blood mononuclear cell , patient experience clinical response . OUTLINE : This pilot , dose-escalation study . Patients receive alvocidib intravenously ( IV ) 4½ hour weekly week 1-4 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease 4 course therapy discontinue study treatment . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) receive 1 additional course therapy beyond documentation CR . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos alvocidib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . A total 10 patient treated MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 4 week .</detailed_description>
