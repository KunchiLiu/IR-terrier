	<brief_title>Safety Study Evaluate FluMist Immunocompromised Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , double-blind Phase 1 study FluMist vs. placebo mild moderately immunocompromised child 5 17 year age cancer . The primary objective study describe safety FluMist compare placebo mild moderately immunocompromised child cancer . The secondary objective study describe immune response follow vaccination FluMist determine incidence duration viral replication follow vaccination FluMist . The standard 0.5 mL dose vaccine placebo administer intranasally . Patients evaluate four visit schedule day 3-5 , day 7-10 , day 14-28 , day 35-42 viral shed via nasal swab . Safety outcomes collect study clinic visit telephone contact 42 day post dose . Serious adverse event significant new medical condition collect 180 day receipt investigational product . Immune response measure detection influenza-specific antibody measure standard hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) assay . Influenza-specific serum antibody isotype level determine nasal swab specimen analyze expression influenza-specific immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) . Serum analyze ability neutralize viral particle infect Madin-Darby canine kidney cell ( microneutralization ) . Baseline immunosuppression measure expression T- B-lymphocyte subset compare immunosuppression time point vaccination . The duration viral replication titer live-attenuated influenza virus shed evaluate nasal swab specimen collect scheduled time point administration FluMist .</detailed_description>
