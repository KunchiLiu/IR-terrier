	<brief_title>Trilostane Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients take trilostane orally day three day , twice day thereafter . - Patients complete daily drug log record date , time number capsule take . - Trilostane may moderately decrease production steroid adrenal gland . In order prevent symptom relate decreased steroid production , patient also take hydrocortisone time trilostane . - While patient treatment blood work do 2 week every 4 week test level PSA blood . On week 4 8 treatment additional blood work do check hormone level . Blood pressure pulse rate also take every 4 week . - Depending upon disease status , radiological testing ( CT scan , x-ray , and/or bone scan ) may repeat every 12 week . - Patients remain study treatment long disease respond experience severe side effect .</detailed_description>
