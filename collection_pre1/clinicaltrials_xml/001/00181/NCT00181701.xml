	<brief_title>Intraperitoneal Paclitaxel Carboplatin Treatment Women With Carcinoma Mullerian Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients intraperitoneal port place time initial surgery second procedure prior cycle 2 chemotherapy . Patients receive total 6 cycle therapy outpatient . They 1 cycle paclitaxel/carboplatin intravenously follow 5 cycle paclitaxel/carboplatin intraperitoneally . Chemotherapy treatment give day 1 , 8 , 15 cycle . Each cycle 21 day long . To help reduce chance allergic reaction , patient also take decadron tablet orally paclitaxel administration . About 1 liter standard salt solution inject catheter abdominal cavity treatment help distribute drug throughout abdominal cavity . `` Second-look '' surgery ( laparoscopy laparotomy ) perform 3-8 week last chemotherapy course ( cycle 6 ) patient complete clinical remission . This surgery do see effective chemotherapy . Tests procedures do throughout treatment see cancer respond monitor safety purpose . These test procedure include routine history physical exam , neurological exam , routine blood test . As part study also check amount paclitaxel carboplatin blood . Participation study last approximately 6 month long treatment well tolerate , serious side effect disease progress .</detailed_description>
