	<detailed_description>The study randomize , double blind , placebo control trial . Subjects admit General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) outpatients undergo baseline pump study . One lactation consultant educate subject proper technique pump first day study evaluate technique day 5 day 8 study . The lactation consultant also instruct patient record volume milk pump time pump episode . Subjects encourage direct contact infant prior pump . All infant contact , infant latch onto breast mother 's stress level also record throughout study . Starting 8 day 1 , hospital grade breast pump use drain breast confirm absence milk flow 2 min episode pump palpation . Pumping performed manner every 3 hour around clock . Subjects allow 5 hour window sleep , however , long total number pump episode equal 8 24 hour . During first episode pumping , baseline prolactin level drawn immediately start pump repeated 10 min interval 60 min , every 30 min total 3 hour document peak prolactin level . An intravenous line place draw blood . Subsequently , subject randomize receive prolactin placebo . On morning day 2 , 5 8 , blood collect prolactin level medication injection . Subsequently , prolactin 60 mg/kg placebo inject subcutaneously study nurse 3 hr last pumping episode . On day 2 8 , additional blood collect every 10 min first hour , every 30 min hour 2 3 , 4 , 6 8 hour injection determine peak prolactin level pump session . Subjects drain breast confirm absence milk flow 2 min episode pump palpation milk volume record . The subject ' vital sign monitor immediately every 15 minute 1 hr , every 30 min hour 2 3 , 4 , 6 8 hour injection prolactin/placebo . Temperature measure injection , every hour hour 2 3 , 4 , 6 8 hour injection placebo/prolactin . If change vital sign , day 5 8 vital sign monitor baseline , . Subjects teach SC injection administer second dose SC r-hPRL placebo 12 hour first dose . Subjects continue every 12 hour SC r-hPRL placebo administration next 7 day . Subjects ask refrigerate milk bring GCRC visit volume record confirmed test milk composition prolactin level give infant . The final prolactin injection give even study day 8 . All side effect mother baby record daily throughout study . Subjects return final outpatient visit day 16 , determine treatment effect persist . During visit , milk pump baseline volume record . In addition , blood drawn 10 min interval 60 min , every 30 min total 3 hour document peak prolactin level . Subjects turn pump diary next day .</detailed_description>
