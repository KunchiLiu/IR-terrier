	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether inpatient use high frequency chest wall oscillator effective therapy patient hospitalize asthma exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) exacerbation . The investigator hypothesize inpatient use HFCWO promote clearance airway secretion , lead rapid resolution severe asthma COPD exacerbation low rate re-exacerbations hospital discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chest Wall Oscillation Asthma COPD Exacerbations Trial ( COAT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) common chronic pulmonary disorder periodic exacerbation characterize increase airway obstruction , mucous hypersecretion , respiratory symptom dyspnea , cough , wheeze . Despite major advance treatment disorder , severe asthma COPD exacerbation common result 500,000 hospitalization per year United States . Moreover , re-exacerbations common population , occur 25 % within 1 month 50 % within 12 month hospital discharge . Inhaled medication , rely deposition distal airspace suppress airway inflammation promote bronchodilation , use treatment prevention asthma COPD exacerbation . However , excessive mucous production impair airway mucociliary clearance lead airway plugging , reduce deposition response inhale medication . These consideration highlight need therapy clear airway mucus patient asthma COPD . High frequency chest wall oscillation ( HFCWO ) may novel strategy mechanical airway clearance improve outcome patient asthma/COPD exacerbation . The feasibility efficacy daily HFCWO severe asthma COPD exacerbation , however , adequately study . We hypothesize inpatient use HFCWO promote clearance airway secretion , lead rapid resolution severe asthma COPD exacerbation low rate re-exacerbations hospital discharge . The objective proposal conduct 3-year feasibility study adult hospitalize asthma/COPD exacerbation 1 ) ass patient acceptability HFCWO severe asthma exacerbation , 2 ) collect preliminary data clinical efficacy HFCWO add conventional medical therapy . These data serve basis large , multi-center clinical trial .</detailed_description>
