	<brief_summary>This research do find treatment atorvastatin , drug reduces cholesterol , improve function blood vessel among people high blood pressure . Adults mildly high blood pressure , take medication high blood pressure otherwise healthy may join , approval health care provider . The study period 14-17 week . Approximately 50 60 subject take part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Statin Use Vascular Function Hypertensive Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects treat either atorvastatin placebo . We test function blood vessel baseline 3 month treatment . Treatment people high blood pressure atorvastatin experimental . It necessary compare experimental treatment placebo know work . Subjects assign group give experimental treatment placebo chance ( like flip coin ) . Subjects evaluate heart , lung , kidney liver disease . Only people without disease may join study . Screening visit : Subjects ask fast overnight screen visit . Chest Examination EKG : On first visit , perform chest examination EKG . The subject 's blood pressure measure several time , 2 minute measurement subject sit quietly several minute . Exercise Stress test : Subjects schedule exercise treadmill test consist walk move platform . Your heart rate , blood pressure EKG watch exercise . The speed slope platform increase cause gradual increase workload . The EKG exercise show good blood supply heart . Urine test pregnancy : This test do woman childbearing age child bear potential . Blood test : We draw 15 ml ( 1 tablespoonful ) blood test cholesterol , glucose , liver kidney function . After test complete screen visit , subject give advice diet healthy lifestyle control blood pressure . The screening result indicate whether subject join study . If abnormal result , investigator refer subject primary health care provider . The total amount time require screen visit two hour . If subject qualify join study , baseline visit schedule within 2 week . If subject meet condition , except blood pressure high take blood pressure medication allow study , health care provider contact permission give blood pressure medication allow . If subject give blood pressure medication , follow-up visit two week schedule check blood pressure . Blood pressure check visit : This visit schedule blood pressure medication add change . The blood pressure measure several time , 2 minute measurement . If blood pressure control , subject may continue study . The baseline visit schedule within 2 week . Baseline visit : Subjects ask take medication 24 48 hour visit may eat food , drink coffee , tea , milk , citrus fruit juice caffeinated soda 8 hour test . Pulse Pressure record sit quietly rest . The blood pressure measure several time , 2 minute measurement . Urine test : Urine collect test chemistry . Brachial artery reactivity : The subject lie bed . The blood pressure measure one arm.Another blood pressure cuff wrap around arm . The artery arm study use echo machine use sound wave image blood vessel . The blunt tip echo probe place arm apply gel skin . Images artery record two minute . The cuff inflate squeeze arm tightly five minute release . Images artery make throughout five minute cuff inflate three minute release pressure . During test pulse finger hand record use two finger strap . Pulse Wave Velocity : The investigator use echo machine measure fast pulse travel subject 's neck thigh . For test subject lie technician hold one echo probe neck one upper thigh . Blood test : At visit 15 ml ( 1 tablespoonful ) blood drawn test insulin , marker inflammation platelet function . Coronary Artery Flow Velocity Reserve : The subject lie bed fine tube ( i.v . line ) place arm allow study drug inject vein . A drug make blood vessel clearly visible echo inject vein . An echo technician place tip echo probe chest apply gel . The technician record image heart 10 minute . Then adenosine , increase blood flow heart , inject vein , echo image record next 5 minute . Adenosine drug use clinically stress test . Subjects may feel desire take deep breath perform strenuous exercise . In , drug make artery clearly visible injected 10 minute adenosine 5 minute adenosine total 15 minute . The i.v . drug stop record . EKG monitor throughout procedure . Subjects may request i.v . drug record stop uncomfortable . The blood flow reserve measure later record image . The total time spent test baseline visit two hour thirty minute . Skin Cholesterol Measurement : Prior skin test hand wash . The palm hand also clean alcohol pad . A small amount cholesterol bind solution place palm hand 1 minute . This blot . An indicator solution place area 2 minute . This result development spot blue color . The blue color wipe paper towel end test . A handheld spectrophotometer ( small device `` read '' color intensity skin solution place ) place palm . This device attach laptop computer generate numerical skin cholesterol value . A sample cell skin surface collect press piece sticky tape 10 time subject 's palm . The tape sticky use office stationery . This tape send another laboratory analysis . Dispensing drug : Subjects give packet medication take next three month . Subjects take one capsule day . Final Visit : The final visit schedule 3 month follow baseline visit . Subjects may take medication 24 hour visit may eat food , drink coffee , tea , milk caffeinated soda 8 hour visit . All test perform baseline visit repeat . Approximately 30 ml ( 2 tablespoonsful ) blood drawn test include cholesterol , glucose , insulin , liver kidney function , marker inflammation . Urine collect urine test . The total time spent test final visit two hour thirty minute .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman 2075 year age . The subject sit systolic blood pressure measurement 140159 mm Hg ( measure use JNC VI procedure ) OR prescription verify history use stable ( 3 month ) antihypertensive medication ( certain drug exclude ) . Potential subject therapy systolic BP 140159 mmHg advise diet lifestyle change accord JNC VI guideline prior study participation . They must able give informed consent . Subjects currently use lipidlowering medication statin , niacin gemfibrozil . Systolic BP &gt; 159 mmHg diastolic BP &gt; 99 mmHg despite antihypertensive medication . Subjects blood pressure reading value give trial antihypertensive therapy two week use drug hydrochlorthiazide and/or metoprolol permission primary healthcare provider . If control , allow enroll . Subjects clonidine . Subjects clonidine express interest study consider primary health care provider permit investigator change allow antihypertensive medication , i.e. , hydrochlorthiazide metoprolol , meet enrollment criterion two week therapy . Subjects ACE inhibitor calcium channel blocker express interest study consider primary health care provider permit investigator change allow antihypertensive medication , i.e. , hydrochlorthiazide metoprolol , meet enrollment criterion two week therapy . If betablocker/diuretic treatment effective tolerate , advise subject 's primary health care provider , subject may remain study ACE inhibitor calcium channel blocker . Subjects treat antifungal agent antibiotic erythromycin . Women use oral contraceptive drug . Diabetic patient antihypertensive medication . Subjects EKG abnormality screen visit , ischemic EKG abnormality stress testing , history prior diagnosis ischemic heart disease , use digoxin , nitroglycerine/antianginal agent , theophyllinelike drug antiarrhythmic medication . Subjects history chronic obstructive airway disease , evidence disease clinical examination screen visit . ( x ) Persons current smoker . Subjects abnormal liver renal function test screen visit .
