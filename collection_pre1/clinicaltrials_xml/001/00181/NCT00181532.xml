	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect adminstration celecoxib , cox2-inhibitor patient stage II-III non small cell lung cancer receive radical radiotherapy . The hypothesis celecoxib increase remission rate radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Celecoxib Concurrent Radiotherapy Stage II-III NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) difficult , even best classical radiation chemotherapy schedule result remain disappointing . However , evidence increase local control rate deliver radiotherapy either short period time concomitantly chemotherapy improves survival . Drawback high radiation dose addition chemotherapy high incidence toxicity . So radiation dose escalation could lead improvement prognosis , radiation dose however limit radiation-induced lung esophageal damage . For NSCLC , non-toxic agent increase effectiveness radiotherapy decrease radiation induce lung esophageal damage need . The cox-2-inhibitors seem suitable purpose . In experimental mouse tumor model , already show COX-2-inhibitors inhibit tumor growth enhance radio-response tumor . Moreover , anti-inflammatory agent , asCOX-2-inhibitors , also lower incidence radiation pneumonitis esophagitis . In study simultaneous favourable effect COX-2 inhibitor tumor response radiation damage human cancer patient investigate . Patients randomise receive Celecoxib placebo . All patient receive radiotherapy treatment . Primary outcome measure tumor response , assess CT-scan thorax , three month radiotherapy . The tumor response rate experimental group compare tumor response rate control group .</detailed_description>
