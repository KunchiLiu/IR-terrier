	<brief_title>HI-CHART : Feasibility High-Dose Accelerated Conformal Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer still common cancer main cause cancer death . Treatment choice patient often radiotherapy , result overall 5-year survival rate 5 10 % . The addition chemotherapy improve survival percentage therefore consider standard treatment patient stage III disease . However , several factor identify impact local control also survival . 1 . There dose-effect relationship . A high dose result well survival rate . However , high radiation dos currently deliver conventional radiation due tolerance normal tissue . 2 . The time factor play important role radiotherapy . Prolonging overall treatment time decrease outcome radiotherapy . Radiobiological modelling data show overall treatmetn time ( OTT ) keep 4 week . Results study support conclusion . So , probably best result achieve high radiation dose deliver within 4 week , without severally damage normal tissue . In order achieve goal , hyperfractionated accelerated treatment regimen together technically advanced radiation technique avoid much normal tissue possible , use study .</detailed_description>
