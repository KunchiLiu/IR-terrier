	<brief_title>Recombinant Human Prolactin Lactation Induction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy recombinant human prolactin ( r-hPRL ) treatment primary lactation insufficiency woman prolactin deficiency , either congenital acquire , examine . Subjects participate open-label study r-hPRL administration prolactin deficiency . On study day 1 , subject see 8 10 . A baseline prolactin level obtain . Subjects subsequently teach use breast pump designate lactation consultant pump 10 minute breast , simultaneously sequentially . Any milk production record , along milk volume throughout study . Prolactin level obtain every 10 minute 60 minute pump begin , every 30 minute total 3 hour . At 3 hour , r-hPRL 60 mg/kg administer SC . Blood drawn every 2 hour 8 hour obtain peak prolactin level . Vital sign monitor every 15 minute first hour , every 2 hour total 8 hour . Subjects pump breast 0 , 3 6 hour r-hPRL injection , maintain every 3 hour schedule . Any milk production record . Subjects administer second dose SC r-hPRL 12 hour first dose . Subjects continue every 12 hour SC r-hPRL administration next 28 day . They also pump every 3 hour , exception 5 hour break sleep one time 24 hour , long total number pump episode equal 8 . Subjects record milk production call soon milk express . When first milk produce , infant allow suckle breast milk test readministered infant control set avoid potential risk r-hPRL exposure infant interim . After pump episode , milk produce mother encourage let infant fee breast use Lact-Aid device . Subjects see GCRC , weekly 28 day . At visit , subject breast exam galactorrhea baseline prolactin level , subject administer SC r-hPRL injection pump 0 , 3 6 hour r-hPRL administration , describe . Any milk production record . In addition , end week 1 final day , r-hPRL administer , blood drawn every 2 hour prolactin level first day injection , total 8 hour , subject pump milk volume record 0 , 3 6 hour r-hPRL administration . When least 0.25 cc milk produce pumping , send prolactin level measurement determine whether level elevate compare level control milk . If prolactin level elevate , milk readministered infant . When breast milk first give infant , monitor GCRC supervision neonatologist , vital sign , include temperature , measure every hour feed 4 hour . The mother also record stool gastric output change note quality quantity output follow 24 hour . If significant adverse change vital sign gastric output observe , additional store breast milk discard study stop . After prolactin level milk document normal range milk readministered infant supervision GCRC , mother continue pump immediately r-hPRL dose , time encourage breastfeed . When least 1 cc milk available , milk composition also analyze fat , protein , glucose , lactose IgA level ( see Procedure Analyzing Collected Milk , ) . Studies mother premature infant perform start protocol . If level component 50 % low limit normal , breast milk supplement formula ratio determine neonatologist ensure nutrient receive . After complete 28 day every 12 hour r-hPRL administration , breast milk production continue monitor 14 day control period . Subjects see 7 14 day final prolactin injection . After baseline prolactin level drawn , milk pump breast empty . Blood drawn baseline every 10 minute 60 minute , every 30 minute total 3 hour obtain prolactin peak .</detailed_description>
