	<brief_summary>The primary aim study use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy look myo-Inositol containing compound ( Ino ) creatine + phosphocreatine ( Cr ) anterior cingulate 20 child bipolar disorder age 6-17 year old free risperidone treatment 20 child bipolar disorder eight-week longer treatment risperidone . For comparison , result also obtain 20 control ( without bipolar disorder ADHD ) age gender well 20 child adolescent diagnosis Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . We hypothesize Ino/Cr level anterior cingulate correlate positively manic symptom use Young mania rating scale ( YMRS ) . Ino/Cr level anterior cingulate anterior cingular gyrus lower subject receive eight week longer risperidone</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Choline contain compound ( Cho ) creatine + phosphocreatine ( Cr ) find great orbitofrontal cortex depress adolescent . In addition , Cho/Cr find increase anterior cingulate depress patient bipolar affective disorder ( BPD ) compare comparison subject . Also , BPD subject take antidepressant significantly high anterior cingulate Cho/Cr compare subject take antidepressant comparison subject . Therefore would appear frontal lobe Cho/Cr increase depression . Given finding , interested look subject mania investigate may also biological marker mania drug response . Mania measure use YMRS associated increase anterior cingulate Ino/Cr manic child , adolescent , adult bipolar affective disorder . In addition , child adolescent responsive lithium show decrease Ino/Cr level acute lithium treatment . We test whether Ino/Cr level correlate positively manic symptom use YMRS , well whether overall Ino/Cr level low child adolescent receive risperidone . The primary aim study use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy look myo-Inositol containing compound ( Ino ) creatine + phosphocreatine ( Cr ) anterior cingulate 20 child bipolar disorder age 6-17 year old free risperidone treatment 20 child bipolar disorder eight-week longer treatment risperidone . For comparison , result also obtain 20 control ( without bipolar disorder ADHD ) age gender well 20 child adolescent diagnosis Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . We hypothesize Ino/Cr level anterior cingulate correlate positively manic symptom use Young mania rating scale ( YMRS ) . Ino/Cr level anterior cingulate anterior cingular gyrus lower subject receive eight week longer risperidone</detailed_description>
