	<brief_title>Macrolides Prevent Exacerbations Asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) two common obstructive lung disease . Chronic airway inflammation episodic worsen respiratory symptom airflow obstruction ( exacerbation ) occur asthma COPD . Despite major advance development therapy respiratory disorder , asthma COPD exacerbation common result substantial morbidity mortality . Moreover , patient hospitalize asthma COPD exacerbation high risk near fatal fatal re-exacerbations discharge home . These observation highlight need novel therapy prevent asthma COPD exacerbation . The role macrolide antibiotic ( e.g. , azithromycin , clarithromycin , erythromycin ) treat bacterial infection well establish . Recent pre-clinical evidence also suggest macrolides may posses distinct anti-inflammatory property even anti-viral property . These excite observation lead research evaluate use maintenance therapy macrolides patient asthma COPD . Small study clinically stable asthma COPD suggest maintenance macrolide therapy ( e.g. , use 6 week ) , add usual care , may attenuate airway inflammation , reduce respiratory symptom , improve lung function . However , study evaluate potential benefit initiate maintenance macrolide therapy asthma COPD exacerbation . We hypothesize initiate maintenance macrolide therapy hospitalize patient asthma COPD exacerbation , add usual medical care , accelerate improvement airflow obstruction , respiratory symptom , quality life reduce risk re-exacerbations discharge home . The objective pilot study evaluate feasibility study protocol ( recruitment , retention , adherence study procedure medication ) , well collect preliminary data proportion exacerbation due bacterial viral infection estimate potential effect size clinically important outcome ( respiratory symptom , quality life , airflow obstruction , airway inflammation , rate re-exacerbations ) . To achieve objective , propose 48 week randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial ( 24 week azithromycin , 24 week placebo ) adult hospitalize asthma COPD exacerbation Johns Hopkins Hospital Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center .</detailed_description>
