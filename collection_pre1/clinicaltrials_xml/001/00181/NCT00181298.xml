	<brief_summary>Neuropsychiatric manifestation Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( NPSLE ) common important source morbidity . Of case definition NPSLE syndrome recently develop , cognitive dysfunction appear prevalent . A novel mechanism subset SLE patient cognitive dysfunction antibody NR2 glutamate receptor . We propose , double -blind placebo-controlled trial , determine whether SLE patient , without NR2 glutamate receptor antibody , significant improvement use memantine , inhibitor NMDA receptor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients SLE frequently report cognitive memory problem many study document significant cognitive deficit traditional neuropsychological test battery . Many traditional neuropsychological test unsuitable repeated measure short interval cause expected improvement due test-retest practice effect . We utilize automated battery ( ANAM ) cognitive function test baseline , 6 week , 12 week , outcome measure . Betty Diamond M.D . colleague demonstrate subset lupus anti-DNA antibody cross-reacts NR2 glutamate receptor patient SLE . Glutamate receptor display alter expression major psychosis over-stimulation NR2 cause excitotoxic neuron death excessive entry calcium cell . Thus , antibody reactivity NR2a NR2b may serve marker CNS disease SLE may also neuropathogenic mechanism non-focal CNS disturbance SLE . Memantine low- moderate-affinity , noncompetitive N-methyl-D-asparate ( NMDA ) receptor represent first member new class medication show clinical benefit good tolerability Alzheimer 's Disease . Because anecdotal experience SLE patient cognitive impairment improve donepezil therapy , approve Alzheimer 's Disease therapy , know association cognitive impairment SLE anti-NR2 glutamate ( NMDA ) receptor antibody , hypothesize memantine benefit cognitive dysfunction SLE . We believe computerized cognitive function battery ( ANAM ) use clinical trial cognitive impairment , benefit efficiency , immediate result , le patient time . However , first clinical trial kind SLE , also use formal American College Rheumatology neuropsychiatric battery , well</detailed_description>
