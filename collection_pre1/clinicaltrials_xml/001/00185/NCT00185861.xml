If initial primary brain tumor histologically malignant glioma subsequent contrast enhance MRI imaging show tumor consistent recurrence , additional biopsy surgery require . However , lowgrade neoplasm initial histologic diagnosis , tissue confirmation malignant glioma require time recurrence . Age : Patients must &gt; 18 year age Patients must Karnofsky &gt; 60 % , and/or ECOG performance status &lt; 2 Patients must estimate life expectancy great 8 week .

Patients chemotherapy conventional radiotherapy within 3 week enrollment . Patients receive prior radiosurgery stereotactic radiotherapy within 10mm current target tumor . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients undergo MRI CT eligible MRI use confirm diagnosis CT use treatment planning . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition arsenic trioxide agent use study . Patients take substance know prolong QT interval , see Appendix B . If QT prolong drug discontinue switch alternative agent , patient allow enroll protocol long agent discontinue period least 2 week . Patients currently take Amphotericin B related antifungal agent exclude due potential increase renal electrolyte waste arsenic trioxide therapy . Patients know seconddegree heart block cardiac dysfunction . New York Heart Association Class II great ( see Appendix E ) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
