	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm colorectal neuroendocrine cancer two hepatic metastatic lesion . Patients must unresectable liver metastasis virtue : Bilobar disease . Extrahepatic disease . Patients medical contraindication surgery . Anatomic sit within liver opinion surgeon would likely leave positive margin . Patient must minimum 2 RFAeligible lesion liver . Such hepatic lesion 5 cm small accessible RF ablation , general excludes sit contiguous critical structure bowel central bile duct also amenable radiographic localization small lesion dome liver . Extrahepatic disease allow provide liver lesion represent lifethreatening site patient . Examples include sub centimeter asymptomatic lung metastasis asymptomatic retroperitoneal lymph node peritoneal metastasis Evaluable disease CT scan MRI addition lesion treat RFA . More 4 week must elapse time major surgery completion last dose chemotherapy , radiation therapy , investigational therapy patient must adequately recover effect . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 % . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm^3 platelet &gt; 70,000/mm^3 total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . albumin &gt; 2.8 mg/dL Patients must adequate clot function ( platelet &gt; 70k ; INR &lt; 1.4 ; PTT &lt; 60 ) . Age &gt; 18 year . The effect DCs develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . No history autoimmune disease . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients may receive anticoagulation therapy . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude poor prognosis often develop progressive neurological dysfunction would confound evaluation neurological adverse effect . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients history portal hypertension , cirrhosis/hepatitis , radiographic evidence cirrhosis and/or varix high risk develop complication undergo liver biopsy may exclude investigator ' discretion participation protocol .
