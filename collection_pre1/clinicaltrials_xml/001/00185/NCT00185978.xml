	<detailed_description>To develop evaluate , randomize , control trial , comprehensive obesity prevention program third , fourth fifth grade student . Late childhood early adolescence appear important period development obesity . Physiologic change associate puberty may increase risk acquire clinically significant obesity . Onset obesity early adolescence appear associate increased risk `` track '' obesity adulthood , obesity-associated morbidity mortality adulthood , obesity-associated psychosocial morbidity . However , ( 1 ) limit ability accurately identify child become obese adult suffer obesity-related morbidity , ( 2 ) exist treatment overweight child adolescent yield modest , unsustained effect , ( 3 ) single-component preventive intervention relatively ineffective . Acknowledging observation , consensus recent NHLBI Strategy Development Workshop Public Education Weight Obesity population-based primary secondary prevention effort , target pre-adolescents , may hold great promise address problem obesity . Therefore , propose integrated , multiple-component , school family-based , primary secondary prevention program target third , fourth fifth grader .

We evaluate efficacy comprehensive intervention cohort third grader , ethnically diverse elementary school . Schools randomly assign comprehensive intervention attention-placebo curriculum , minimize potential compensatory rivalry resentful demoralization . Assessments child 's height , weight , triceps skinfold thickness , waist hip circumference , food preference , cardio-respiratory fitness , self-reported behavior , attitude , knowledge occur every 6 month , 6-months follow end intervention . The primary outcome body mass index . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To significantly reduce body mass index , compare control , end three year intervention .</detailed_description>
