	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . Determine change level tumor bioactivity upon treatment atorvastatin . Secondary objective : 2 . Determine validity tumor bioactivity biologic endpoint correlation clinical response . 3 . Determine whether administration atorvastatin tolerable safe low grade NHL patient . We anticipate significant toxicity since dose atorvastatin FDA approve patient hypercholesterolemia .</brief_summary>
