	<brief_title>Reducing Television Viewing Prevent Childhood Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The United States experience dramatic increase obesity among child adult . Population-based primary prevention may hold great promise . Unfortunately , obesity prevention program specifically attempt reduce fat calorie intake increase physical activity relatively ineffective reduce body fatness . As result , press need innovative intervention prevent obesity . Children spend time watch television videotape play video game activity except sleep . As result , widespread speculation television view might one easily modifiable cause obesity among child . This hypothesis broad appeal , difficult validate . Epidemiological study consistently find weak association medium use childhood obesity , additional epidemiological study unlikely help clarify relationship . We propose innovative experimental model . In current environment , television view already prevalent , question great clinical , practical policy importance : Will reduce television , videotape video game use prevent childhood obesity ? As foundation proposal , complete two pilot study demonstrate ( 1 ) possible significantly reduce child 's television , videotape video game use ( 2 ) school-based intervention reduce child 's television , videotape video game use may result clinically significant decrease adiposity . We propose school-based randomized control trial involve 12 ethnically- socioeconomically-diverse elementary school approximately 900 third grader . Six school randomly assign receive intervention reduce television , videotape video game use six school receive attention-placebo control intervention , minimize potential compensatory rivalry resentful demoralization . Our propose intervention model derive directly principles Bandura 's social cognitive theory include classroom curriculum parent newsletter . The primary intervention deliver throughout third grade school year . Survey physical assessment child occur baseline , end 3rd grade ( post-test ) begin end 4th grade ( 4 month one year follow-up , respectively ) . A subsample child participate 4 day activity monitoring three 24-hour dietary recall baseline , post-test one-year follow-up . Parents interview phone . PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS : Compared control , third grade child expose school-based intervention reduce time spend watch television videotape play video game , significantly reduce body mass index ( BMI , kg/m2 ) . In addition , triceps skinfold thickness waist hip ratio measure characterize change obesity result intervention . SECONDARY HYPOTHESES : Children attend intervention school significantly decrease amount time spend watch television , watch videotape play video game ; Children attend intervention school significantly increase level moderate vigorous physical activity total physical activity ; Children attend intervention school significantly improve physical fitness ; Children attend intervention school significantly reduce fat intake total calorie intake ; Children attend intervention school significantly reduce number meal snack eat watch television videotape play video game .</detailed_description>
