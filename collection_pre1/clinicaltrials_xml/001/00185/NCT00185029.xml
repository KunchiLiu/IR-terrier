	<brief_summary>This proposal target patient prostate cancer candidate either curative surgery curative radiotherapy lymph node stag indicate . Recently , show , patient PSA &lt; 10 ng/ml Gleason score &lt; 7 risk lymph node metastasis low . Therefore , unnecessary PLND non-invasive imaging avoid safely group . PLND nowadays perform patient intermediate high risk nodal metastasis . Thus subgroup patient target study consist patient prostate cancer PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml Gleason score &gt; 6 . - If high sensitivity ( 90 % ) negative predictive value ( 96 % ) MRL validate 8 participate centre , patient negative MRL invasive PLND may avoid . - In patient positive MRL enlarge node ( large 8 mm ) histological diagnosis may obtain imaged guide biopsy , thus also patient avoid PLND . A limitation image guide biopsy , however , 30 % false negative rate . [ Barentsz , Oyen , Wolf ] - In patient positive small node ( small 8 mm ) urologist may , focus MRL finding positive node outside “ surgical field-of-view ” , extend dissection , thus improve accuracy . - Based expected high sensitivity MRL technique completely replace CT-scanning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective ( ) propose study The first objective study evaluate whether MRL replace currently use nodal stag technique CT-scanning PLND patient prostate cancer . The second objective determine effect implement new technique diagnostic cost cost therapeutic consequence . The third , methodological , objective develop protocol diagnostic test evaluation . Define research question propose study 1 . Can result -especially high sensitivity ( 92 % ) high negative predictive value ( 96 % ) - pilot study new nodal staging technique ( MRL ) , reproduce investigator ? 2 . Can MRL improve detection rate small nodal metastasis normal sized node patient prostate cancer , compare CT lymph node dissection ? 3 . Should MRL replace CT PLND future , base high negative predictive value ? 4 . Will replacement result decrease diagnostic cost cost therapeutic consequence equal quality life use time horizon 6 month ? Study design ( motivate ) The design study compare MRL versus CT PLND detect pelvic lymph node metastasis prostate cancer patient exist two part . First study accuracy diagnostic option , consecutive patient subject MRL CT diagnostic therapeutic action depend absence presence lymph node metastasis , irrespective test indicate metastasis . Given fact test perform every participate patient investigation make separately read independently , ( randomise ) comparative study need . Because negative MRL lead PLND ( base pilot 72 % case ) positive MRL ( 28 % ) biopsy , observational study make possible compare MRL CT result patient gold standard ( histological finding ) . In patient undergo PLND , result PLND compare directly CT MRL . As imaging finding guide PLND , patient also additional value diagnostic imaging technique , e.g . removal extra -image positive- node evaluate . The second part study concern analysis economic aspect image strategy combination diagnostic therapeutic course action . The design study aspect decision analytic model . The first step decision analysis design structure model . The model reflect current clinical strategy compare alternative clinical strategy base MRL . This step decision analysis exist review literature order able design concept model structure . A meeting radiologists urologist participate hospital organise order discus validate model structure . The next phase model study application probability , cost patient outcome data model . The empirical part study provide necessary data . Selection criterion study population / data source / search strategy All patient histologically proven prostate cancer schedule PLND eligible study . Patients include intermediate high risk lymph node metastasis ( PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml , Gleason score &gt; 6 ) . Excluded patient 18 year age , patient contraindication MRI ( claustrophobia , pacemaker , surgical clip brain ) , patient history severe allergy contrast agent drug ( anaphylactic shock , severe asthma attack ) . Description intervention ( ) ( include follow-up ) / selection information / data extraction In 396 consent consecutive patient prostate cancer , meet study criterion , standardize diagnostic protocol perform . The protocol include standard CT PLND well new MRL technique . CT scan perform state-of-the-art helical CT scanner use slice thickness maximal 5 mm , contiguous slice , admission intravenous oral contrast . On CT scan lymph node rat positive base size shape criterion , describe Jager et al . [ Jager96 ] The MR-examination perform use state-of-the art equipment ( magnetic field strength 1.5 1.0 T use body phased-array coil ) sequence . Twenty-four 36 hour intravenous infusion USPIO ( particle size 35 nm ; Sinerem , Guerbet , Paris , France ) dose 2.6 mg Fe/kg MR image acquire use high resolution 3 dimensional T1-weighted GRE , 2 dimensional T2*-weighted GRE sequence . The T2*-weighted acquired axial “ obturator ” plane . The 3D sequence evaluate soft-copy reading use multiplanar reconstruction work-station . On MRL image node consider benign show reduction signal intensity involve entire node T2*-weighted MR image , otherwise consider metastatic . The CT MR image assess independently two on-site reader two centralized reader . The CT reader aware others result , MR finding vice versa . Prior start study MRI protocol implement image quality test principal investigator . During study regular quality control CT MRL image perform , ensure optimal result . Before enter patient , learn course organize principal investigator optimize interpretation MRL image . For purpose set image pilot study show normal abnormal node use . Both CT MRL result use evaluation treatment . If positive enlarge node found , image guide FNAB attempt . If metastasis confirm PLND do . When either CT MRL show small positive ( &lt; 10 mm ) node , patient image guide PLND . If CT MRL negative also PLND follow . In case metastasis proven either FNAB biopsy histopathologic examination PLND patient hormonal therapy instead prostatectomy radiotherapy . If nodes negative patient undergo either prostatectomy radiotherapy . The PLND consist either open laparoscopic resection obturator lymph node , external iliac hypogastric node side resect . The imaging result know prior surgery urologist . He give schematic draw radiologist indicate visible node MR image relation iliac vessel , specify normal suspicious one . The urologist ask dissect normal-appearing lymph node appear enlarge , specific attention pathological node CT MR image . Also ask whether resect node within outside “ surgical field view ” . During surgery resect node place grid show location , thereafter send department Pathology evaluation . The pathologist indicate normal metastatic node identical draw one provided urologist . The histopathological examination node include stain hematoxylin eosin , possible Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) stain . Results accuracy , sensitivity , specificity , negative positive predictive value calculate different technique . Because lymph node tissue available patient study , either biopsy , laparoscopic laparotomic PLND , histologic examination consider gold standard presence absence metastasis . Finally , end measurement ( see ) perform cost calculate . Also attempt make select sub-group patient , base pre-imaging information , image cost-effective . Primary secondary outcome parameter ( theoretical operational ) Primary outcome parameter concern accuracy figure MRL CT , sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value diagnostic test . Secondary outcome measure cost per patient strategy . Besides , quality life 6 month follow part analysis order explore idea diagnostic therapeutic strategy result comparable outcome patient level . Sample size calculation ( motivate assumption ) feasibility recruitment Based pilot study prostate cancer patient ( see ) sensitivity MRL expect 90 % NPV 96 % . The percentage patient positive node expect 26 % . In study intend assess accuracy new diagnostic test ( MRL ) . We specifically intend assess statistically significant difference diagnostic performance CT MRL . The reason believe statistically significant difference per se clinical relevance . It merely diagnostic performance MRL key factor whether test implement clinical practice . The power analyse therefore base reliability validity estimate . Following paper Buderer [ Buderer ] evaluate sample size need obtain width 6 % 95 % confidence interval around sensitivity specificity . With expect sensitivity , specificity prevalence patient positive node 376 patient need study assess reliability new diagnostic test ( MRL ) independent test . Given percentage 5 % lose follow 396 patient include study . Data analysis presentation / synthesis The CT , MRL PLND perform interpret standardised way ( see “ description intervention ” ) . The evaluation image finding perform independently 2 on-site reader 2 centralized reader . To test reproducibility , degree agreement observer quantify kappa statistic . The diagnostic accuracy sensitivity , specificity , negative predictive positive predictive value pre- CT MRL determine relation PLND histopathologic finding 95 % confidence interval . Statistical analysis carry SAS software . The additional node find PLND base image finding record . The decision analytic model indicate probability prostate cancer patient diagnose correctly regard lymph node metastasis . The expected cost strategy , one MRL one without , calculate combine probability clinical event happen cost involve . Multi-variable uncertainty data use model explore use probabilistic sensitivity analysis . The distribution variable use uncertainty analysis reflect uncertainty variable find empirical study . For probability use , confidence interval determine variable indicate cost range cost price find participate hospital basis probabilistic sensitivity analysis . In way , uncertainty difference cost strategy determine . In case one strategy expensive effective term patient outcome , incremental cost-effectiveness ratio additional diagnostic cost per extra patient diagnose correctly calculate . The uncertainty surround ratio present cost-effectiveness acceptability curve . In one way sensitivity analysis important accuracy data much false positive rate false negative rate MRL vary order study impact possible efficacy modify implementation MRL clinical study day day health care practise . The impact parameter model result indicate adjust cost-effectiveness acceptability curve . Economic evaluation : general consideration The economic evaluation concentrate comparison two diagnostic strategy combination therapeutic follow determine presence absence pelvic lymph node metastasis prostate cancer patient either MRL CT combination PLND . The empirical study non-comparative observational study , therefore economic evaluation base decision analytic model use data observational study compare two possible diagnostic strategy : MRL versus CT PLND . The general consideration motivate design economic evaluation follow : although MRL compare CT combination PLND expect lead accurate therefore adequate treatment patient prostate carcinoma , patient outcome long term expect different strategy . Therefore , economic evaluation base principle cost minimisation analysis . Using differential approach patient follow period 6 month period cover expect important difference diagnostic therapeutic care thus direct medical cost . Because specific patient population study non medical cost expect different patient group , thus health care perspective basis analysis , indicate health care cost subject study . The research question economic evaluation : result decrease -and much- diagnostic cost cost therapeutic consequence equal quality life use time horizon 6 month ? Economic evaluation : cost analysis In decision analytic model MRL CT combination PLND lead different therapeutic course action . The cost analysis reflect course action base empirical data gathering . The cost analysis exist two main part . First , patient level volume diagnostic therapeutic care measure prospectively use standardised Case Report Forms ( CRF ) . In participate hospital research nurse register CRF number time patient visit patient department , number day hospital ( normal care intensive care distinguish ) , number kind diagnostic procedure ( MRL , CT , histological examination ) , type number operation ( biopsy , laparoscopic lymph node dissection , laparotomic lymph node dissection , latter combination radical prostatectomy ) , duration specific operation , number duration radiotherapeutic session , personnel involve , amount kind pharmaceutical therapy ( e.g . hormonal therapy , pain killer ) . An important aspect cost analysis input decision analytic model cost related false positive false negative regard MRL CT combination PLND . This part CRF design pilot test first month study . The second part cost analysis consist determine cost price volume parameter use multiply volume register participate patient . The Dutch guideline conduct pharmaco-economic study . [ CVZ ] guideline cost analysis use . [ Oostenbrink ] Because health care perspective study , approximation real integral cost use cost analysis . As basis cost price calculation participate hospital base standardised calculation method cost study perform result several estimate cost price . For baseline analysis weigh average ( use number patient include study participate hospital ) use . The range result cost price , available , reference value mention national guideline volume item use extensive sensitivity analysis . Economic evaluation : patient outcome analysis As main outcome observational study , several parameter accuracy MRL versus CT combination PLND determine . Although difference expect final patient outcome ( survival ) , correct incorrect diagnosis pelvic lymph node status patient may lead different short term effect patient outcome . To explore possible difference quality life measurement foreseen observational study . A description disease specific generic quality life prostate cancer patient give basis intake measurement use UCLA prostate cancer index MOS short form 36 ( SF36 ) , respectively . The UCLA Prostate Cancer Index use men prostate cancer administer 20 minute . It include six disease-specific domain measure function dysfunction urinary , sexual , bowel domain . The SF36 study domains physical functioning , problem role function due emotional problem , pain , mental health , vitality , general health perception . It report domain figure 0 100 without generate general score , however . This instrument apply wide variation patient population consider reliable , valid , sensitive . At end follow ( 6 month intake ) , set questionnaire complete participate patient . Analysis data concentrate explore possible difference change quality life form intake end follow patient status pelvic lymph node metastasis ( present absent ) diagnose correctly immediately miss initially . In case difference exist contrary expectation , patient outcome use decision analytic model lead cost-effectiveness analysis instead cost-minimization analysis . Time schedule Include information organisation plan The study period 3 year . In first 3 month ( month 1-3 ) diagnostic protocol optimize , monthly join meeting participate center . During follow inclusion period ( month 4 29 ) , data collect plenary meeting every 3 month take place frequently need . Co-ordination centre facilitate initially weekly later study monthly meeting principal investigator research personnel ( research fellows , research nurse , administrative personnel ) . In period 396 consecutive consenting patient include , outcome diagnostic test evaluate 3 , 12 20 month ( respectively month 7 , 16 24 ) . Inter intra-observer variation study also perform period . All patient complete study within 29 month . Data collect participate hospital uniform way ( CRF ) send UMC Nijmegen . In final period ( month 29-35 ) analysis economic aspect ( model study ) perform Department Medical Technology Assessment UMC Nijmegen . In final month study finding report practice guideline present . An interim analysis result CT MRL ( sensitivity , specificity , NPV . PPV , accuracy ) perform 150 patient . As negative predictive value MRL least 90 % . The NPV express formula : NPV= spec ( 1-prevalence ) spec ( 1-prevalence ) + prevalence ( 1-sens ) Especially sensitivity NPV MRL critical . Assuming fix specificity 93 % fixed prevalence positive node 26 % , sensitivity least 70 % obtain negative predictive value 90 % . The study stop sensitivity statistically significantly small 70 % . Assuming binomial distribution cut-off point sensitivity n=150 62 % . For NPV cut-off value significantly low 90 % 83.5 % . Although low specificity result different diagnostic result increase cost , study stop specificity lower 75 % 150 patient , low specificity negative effect acceptance ( thus implementation ) MRL .</detailed_description>
