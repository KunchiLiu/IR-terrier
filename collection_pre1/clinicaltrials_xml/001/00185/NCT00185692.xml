	<brief_title>Allogeneic Transplantation From Related Haploidentical Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An alternative conventional allogeneic bone marrow transplantation use non-myeloablative conditioning regimen . This regime would consist ; total lymphoid irradiation ( TLI ) anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) . Used combination achieve engraftment haploidentical CD34+ select peripheral blood stem cell old patient patient underlie medical condition preclude standard allogeneic treatment . The expected result transplant regime expect result hematopoietic immunologic reconstitution , decrease death relate treatment regimen decrease gravft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) .</detailed_description>
