	<brief_summary>Acute ankle fracture common child . Most stable low risk problem future . Even though fracture benign , injury often cast fixed time period , inconvenient , expensive , appear practice proven scientifically correct . Therefore , study , healthy child low-risk ankle fracture , , investigator Hospital Sick Children , examine removable ankle brace least good casting respect well fast child return usual activity . In addition , compare cost method patient health care system . Successful management low-risk fracture ankle brace allow several advantage use cast . These advantage include possibility return normal activity faster , few visit specialty hospital clinic , significant cost saving .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine removable ankle brace least effective casting child 5 18 year old low-risk ankle fracture . Rationale : Ankle injury common among child . The Canadian Health Injury Reporting Prevention Program report approximately 5500 ankle injury per year child present 16 participate emergency department , 35 % fracture . The majority ankle injury child , include ankle fracture , excellent prognosis low risk complication . We recently show predefined structure 'low-risk ' clinical exam reliably identify low risk injury , simultaneously exclude 100 % high-risk fracture . This clinical rule reduces need radiography child ankle injury 63 % . However , low-risk injury currently manage uniformly . Low-risk ankle fracture often treat cast soft tissue injury treat brace . Due distinction management , many physician still feel compelled radiograph child low risk ankle injury order identify fracture . We expand previous work show low risk ankle fracture safely treat way soft tissue injury ankle . The current treatment low risk fracture cast inconvenient , necessitate orthopedic referral , may associate soft tissue complication . Furthermore , cast evidence-based practice . Preliminary evidence adult stable ankle fracture suggest ankle brace may offer safe alternative casting , allow comparable resumption usual activity less reliance sub-specialty care . Therefore , primary purpose study compare functional outcome result ankle bracing cast child low-risk ankle fracture . Design : In randomize , outcomes assessor blind , single center trial , child diagnose low-risk ankle fracture receive either ankle brace below-knee walking cast . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure assessment functional daily activity measure modified performance Activities Scale Kids ( ASKp ) four week post injury . Secondary outcome include assessment pain score , ankle range motion return baseline function . A concurrent health economic evaluation conduct use patient health care sector cost . Sample Size Analysis : The null hypothesis primary analysis brace less effective casting least five percentage point ASKp scale . Assuming standard deviation 10 % , alpha = 0.05 , beta = 0.2 10 % dropout rate yield sample size 112 patient . Secondary analysis include Fisher 's Exact test compare proportion child full range motion injure ankle four week full baseline activity level four month , area curve pain-time profile curve compare use Student 's t-test . An economic analysis assess incremental net benefit brace versus cast health care perspective . Significance : If removable brace find least effective cast , study potential standardize treatment low risk ankle injury . Since injury reliably detect physical examination , routine radiography injury eliminate . These injury could therefore safely treated primary physician , thereby reduce number emergency department visit , obviate need orthopedic referral , return visit cast removal . As result , study provide critical information optimal treatment majority ankle injury child perspective clinical efficacy health economics .</detailed_description>
