	<brief_summary>A recent study show administration single dose sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine plus artesunate Senegalese child three occasion short malaria transmission season reduce incidence clinical attack malaria 86 % . However , use drug regimen lead selection parasite molecular marker resistance pyrimethamine sulfadoxine . Therefore , trial three alternative regimen undertaken see effective safe drug combination use initial study less likely select drug resistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Four Drug Regimens Prevention Malaria Senegalese Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In country Sahel sub-Sahel , malaria transmission highly seasonal nearly episodes malaria occur month year . However , mortality morbidity malaria may high period , especially child vulnerable group . It show previously The Gambia elsewhere West Africa regular administration anti-malarial drug throughout period malaria transmission ( chemoprophylaxis ) reduce mortality morbidity substantially chemoprophylaxis difficult sustain . Intermittent preventive treatment ( IPT ) differs chemoprophylaxis drug give less frequent interval drug concentration fall inhibitory level administration . IPT use first protect pregnant woman malaria approach prove effective . More recently , IPT concept applied prevention malaria infant , drug give time infant vaccine administer . However , area seasonal malaria , Senegal , small proportion case severe malaria occur first year life . In area , old child require protection . Intermittent preventive treatment child ( IPTc ) potential way . IPTc involve administration drug child age group risk two three occasion period high malaria transmission . In recent study Senegal show administration single dose sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine ( SP ) plus artesunate child age 6 week 59 month reduce incidence clinical attack malaria 86 % . However , administration drug associate selection parasites molecular marker resistance pyrimethamine sulfonamide . The aim new study investigate alternative drug regimen might equally effective less likely select drug resistance . Objective : The object study find effective drug regimen use intermittent preventive treatment child Senegal . Study Area : The study conduct Niakhar , rural area central Senegal previous trial IPTc conduct . In area , malaria transmission seasonal nearly case occur three four month period year . The entomological inoculation rate area 10 infectious bite per person per year . Study Population : All child age 1 - 5 year reside study area eligible join trial . Study Procedure : Following village meeting , family eligible child contact ask wished child join study . If wish , informed consent obtain child randomise one four treatment arm . At begin end malaria transmission season , child examine finger prick blood sample obtain determination haemoglobin preparation blood film microscopy . A drop blood collect filter paper subsequent molecular study . Following initial evaluation child treat one four drug regimen . These SP + 1 dose artesunate ( regimen use initial trial ) , SP + three dos artesunate , SP + 3 dos amodiaquine 3 dos amodiaquine artesunate . Initial drug administration give observation . Treatment repeat two occasion monthly interval . The health assistant responsible give drug blind study group play part trial . Staff make observation field , example prevalence side effect , laboratory staff blind study code . The incidence clinical attack malaria child randomisation group measure period malaria transmission . Weekly home visit make detect child sick child study attend one clinic study area febrile illness identify . Blood film stain Giemsa examine two microscopist . DNA extract filter paper obtain parasitaemic child examine mutation dhfr dhps gene associate resistance pyrimethamine sulfonamides respectively . All serious adverse event note report Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . Home visit make first 100 child arm trial seven day drug administration enquire side effect associate drug administration . Trial End-Points : The primary end-point trial prevalence marker drug resistance pyrimethamine sulfonamide end malaria transmission season . Secondary end-points incidence clinical attack malaria incidence side effect . Sample Size : Sample size calculate basis comparison three new drug regimens one use previous trial ( SP + 1 dose artesunate ) . It assume 20 % child SP + 1 dose artesunate group would Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia end malaria transmission season provide around 100 % sample molecular study . Assuming prevalence resistance mutation dhfr codon 108 , 59 51 90 % , 500 child would need study arm give trial 90 % power detect 20 % reduction prevalence resistance mutation child receive new drug combination 5 % level significance . Allowing loss follow-up 10 % sample size 2,200 select . Monitoring : The trial monitor clinical monitor provide IPTi consortium . A DSMB review study protocol , standard operating procedure approve analytical plan .</detailed_description>
