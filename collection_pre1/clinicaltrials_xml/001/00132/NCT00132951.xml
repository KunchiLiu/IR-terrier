	<criteria>Subjects meet follow criterion consider enrollment study : Male female adult outpatient subject diagnose AECB CAP Female subject must either postmenopausal ≥ 1 year surgically incapable bearing child . Women childbearing potential must normal menstrual flow ≤ 1 month study entry , negative serum pregnancy test immediately prior study entry , meet criterion acceptable birth control . Informed consent must obtain write subject upon enrollment . Subjects diagnosis AECB CAP , define . AECBSpecific Subjects great equal 35 year age Subjects document history chronic bronchitis : basal force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) &lt; 70 % &gt; 35 % ; least one AECB previous year ; FEV1/forced vital capacity ( FVC ) &lt; 70 % . Subjects clinical diagnosis AECB , presume due bacterial infection base increase sputum purulence either increase dyspnea sputum volume Subjects produce spontaneous sputum Subjects ≥ 10 packyear history cigarette smoke CAPSpecific Fever ( oral temperature &gt; 38°C [ 100.4°F ] tympanic temperature &gt; 38.5°C [ 101.2°F ] rectal temperature &gt; 39°C [ 102.2°F ] ) Chills Pleuritic chest pain Cough Spontaneous production purulent sputum change sputum character Auscultatory finding ( rale [ also know crepitation ] and/or evidence pulmonary consolidation [ ie , dullness percussion , bronchial breath sound , egophony ] ) Subjects great equal 18 year age Chest xray finding support clinical diagnosis bacterial pneumonia ( eg , presence presumably new infiltrate [ ] ) Subjects clinical diagnosis mild moderate CAP due bacterial infection base least 1 follow sign symptoms CAP : In addition , subject clinical diagnosis CAP least 1 follow sign symptoms CAP : Dyspnea tachypnea ( particularly progressive nature ) Subjects present follow include study : Subjects know history congenital longQTc syndrome Subjects pregnant breastfeed Subjects hypersensitivity telithromycin , azithromycin , macrolide class antibiotic Subjects require receive treatment rifampin ( Rifadin ) , phenytoin ( Dilantin ) , carbamazepine ( Carbatrol , Tegretol ) , phenobarbital , St. John 's wort ( herbal supplement ) within 2 week prior Visit 1 study Subjects require treatment study ergot alkaloid derivative , cisapride ( Propulsid ) , pimozide ( Orap ) , bromocriptine , cabergoline ( Dostinex ) , pergolide ( Permax ) Subjects previously participate study Subjects previous history myasthenia gravis Subjects current acute respiratory failure subject require aggressive airway management Hospitalized subject subject institutional care facility Subjects treat oral parenteral antibiotic within 14 day prior enrollment plan take antibiotic study drug treatment period Subjects receiving medication , include systemic antimicrobial agent , disease condition infection could interfere evaluation drug efficacy safety Subjects concomitant condition ( include clinically relevant cardiovascular , hepatic , neurologic , endocrine , major systemic disease ) make either implementation protocol interpretation study result difficult Subjects progressively fatal disease life expectancy &lt; 3 month Subjects receive investigational drug device within 1 month prior study entry , treatment plan study period Subjects recent ( within 3 month ) history drug alcohol abuse Immunocompromised subject , include limited subject : know human immunodeficiency virus infection ( CD4 count &lt; 200/mm3 ) ; know neutropenia ( &lt; 1500 neutrophils/mm3 ) ; chronic corticosteroid therapy ( ≥ 10 mg/day prednisolone therapy equivalent least past 3 month ) ; immunosuppressant treatment , corticosteroid , within previous 6 month ; splenectomized subject subject know hyposplenia asplenia . Subjects mental condition render unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study Subjects unlikely comply protocol ( eg , uncooperative attitude , inability return followup visit , unlikely complete study ) Subjects know impaired hepatic function Subjects know impaired renal function AECBSpecific Subjects acute bronchitis Subjects know diagnosis bronchiectasis ; cystic fibrosis ; lung cancer lung metastasis ; active pulmonary tuberculosis . CAPSpecific Subjects severe pneumonia ( defined investigator 's clinical judgment ) Subjects CAP symptom require parenteral antibiotic treatment , 1 follow condition : Respiratory frequency &gt; 30 breaths/minute Chest xray show increase size opacity ≥ 50 % within 48 hour initial current evaluation Shock ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &lt; 60 mmHg ) Altered mental status ( disorientation person , place , time know chronic , lethargy , stupor , coma ) &lt; 90 % O2 saturation ( pulse oximetry ) , PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg Requires mechanical ventilation Requires vasopressor &gt; 4 hour Urine output &lt; 20 mL/hr total urine output &lt; 80 mL 4 hour , unless another explanation available , acute renal failure require dialysis Hypothermia , define core body temperature &lt; 35°C ( 95°F ) The investigator sponsor must approve waiver inclusion exclusion criterion casebycase basis prior enrol subject . Both investigator sponsor must document waiver . No subject allow enroll study . Subjects Reproductive Potential : Women childbearing potential may participate study follow condition meet : Had normal menstrual flow ≤ 1 month study entry Has negative pregnancy test ( serum βsubunit hCG ) immediately study entry ( ie , start treatment study procedure could potentially harm fetus ) . If obtain serum pregnancy test result cause delay treatment , subject may enter basis negative urine pregnancy test sensitive least 50 mU/mL , pending result serum pregnancy test . Subsequently , result serum test positive , subject must discontinue study drug , every attempt must make follow subject term . Must agree use accept method contraception ( ie , oral implant contraceptive barrier method ; spermicide barrier method ; intrauterine device ) . The subject must agree continue method throughout study .</criteria>
