	<brief_title>Influence Chloroquine HIV Viral Load Among Pregnant Women Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Objective : - To contribute improvement quality effectiveness maternity care service assess impact HIV infection effectiveness IPT SP compare SP plus weekly chloroquine ( CQ ) ass possible anti-retroviral effect chloroquine . Specific Objectives : - To assess impact IPT SP plus placebo CQ SP plus prophylaxis CQ peripheral placental parasitaemia among HIV sero-positive compare HIV sero-negative pregnant woman . - To assess effect HIV infection maternal malaria-related morbidity among pregnant HIV sero-positive woman compare pregnant HIV sero-negative woman treat SP plus placebo CQ SP plus weekly CQ prophylaxis . - To describe effect HIV infection birth weight congenital parasitaemia among baby bear woman give IPT SP compare woman give SP plus CQ prophylaxis pregnancy . - To assess anti-HIV effect CQ among HIV positive pregnant woman measure HIV viral load enrolment delivery . Subsidiary Objectives : - To explore mother ' health care provider ' perception quality maternity service study community . - To explore fever prevention management option use pregnant woman study community . - To explore pregnant woman 's perception malaria prevention pregnancy era HIV/AIDS . Material Methods : All pregnant woman present gestational age 14- 24 week give verbal informed consent enrol study 2 health unit Mbarara District hospital Kampala . These area report highly endemic malaria . The district high prevalence HIV ( 10.6 % ) among antenatal attendant . The main ethnic group area Banyankore migrant population Bakiga , Rwandans Baganda mainly speak Runyankore dialect . The main economic activity mixed farm main food crop grow include banana , finger millet , bean , groundnut , cowpea , sweet potato , cassava , sorghum , maize , tomato , pineapple , passion fruit , sugar cane , mango papaws . The population district estimate 1,093,388 . Females age 15-49 year estimate make 23 % total population . Pregnant woman estimate 5.2 % total population . The total fertility rate Uganda estimate 6.9 . The study randomise double-blind placebo-controlled trial two arm . The researcher ANC staff blind HIV status mother . However , mother choose disclose HIV status antenatal care staff free . Difference placental parasitaemia HIV seropositive HIV seronegative woman use determine sample size . Using power 90 % significance level 5 % , sample size need detect true difference prevalence maternal placental parasitaemia two study group 104 woman per group . However , compensate loss follow-up , 30 % added per group give total 135 HIV seropositive woman arm , give total 270 HIV sero-positive mother two study arm . Since HIV sero-prevalence primigravida attend antenatal care district 10 % , minimum number 1274 woman would require arm ( total 2548 ) . Women enrol ANC clinic three health unit . All pregnant woman , irrespective parity , consent participate study enrol . Demographic socio-economic characteristic record . History fever antimalarial drug use also record . Women randomly allocate SP + CQ ( CQ 300 mg weekly ) SP + placebo group ( IPT twice pregnancy ) . All woman receive supplementation 120mg elementary iron daily 5mg folic acid weekly . IPT SP start second trimester second dose third trimester . Women encourage deliver health unit TBAs involve follow-up deliver village . Health worker liaise TBAs collect information sample ( birth weight blood slide ) . The general health condition mother ( include Hb , clinical malaria , body temperature , body weight , foetal heart sound , urine analysis ) assess throughout pregnancy . Clinical malaria case treat accord national guideline CQ SP . In case treatment failure quinine give second line treatment . Inclusion Exclusion Criteria : All pregnant woman present ANC hospital health centre study , irrespective parity consent participate , enrol study . Only woman consent HIV test do examine viral load include . Women risk pregnancy , severe systemic disease symptom sign AIDS exclude study . Those woman refer diagnosis treatment near hospital . Outcome Variables : - maternal peripheral parasitaemia ; - placental parasitaemia ; - clinical malaria ; - maternal infant Hb ; - birth weight ; - congenital parasitaemia ; - maternal HIV viral load inclusion delivery . Blood smear parasitaemia make enrolment , antenatal follow-up delivery . Screening HIV status do enrolment confirmatory test do time . Viral load assess enrolment 36 week gestation . At enrolment 5 ml blood drawn HIV screening , viral load Hb measurement , malaria parasitaemia assessment . Malaria parasites count 200 leukocyte express number parasites/dl blood assume standard leukocyte count 8000/dl . The HIV status assess use exist Rapid Test use district HIV screening.All woman receive pre- post-screening counselling . Hb measure use Haemo-Cue® portable photometer . Compliance weekly CQ chemoprophylaxis control give woman vary excess tablet CQ placebo take home request return balance monthly visit . Health worker administer SP ( DOT ) . The first dose SP give 14 - 24 week gestation second dose give 28 - 32 week gestation . Health worker keep record gestational age . Parasitaemia Hb assess inclusion , week 28 delivery . During monthly antenatal care visit woman ask illness occur since last visit treatment take . Routine ANC examination undertake . Malaria attack record woman advise come treatment health unit case illness . Records keep health care worker ( laboratory staff , midwife , counsellor ) , TBAs PI . The District Director Health Services ( DDHS ) independent monitor research project . Women present delivery ask recent malaria symptom . Thick blood smear make maternal peripheral blood , placental umbilical cord blood . The newborn baby weigh digital scale . At onset labour , HIV sero-positive woman treat single dose 200mg Nevirapine newborn baby also treat single dose 2mg/kg ( 0.6ml ) Nevirapine within 72 hour birth . Health worker train use Haemo-Cue® portable photometer prepare thick blood slide . Since woman likely deliver village , TBAs train weigh baby , prepare thick blood slide placenta mother deliver village . Blood sample viral load take Nevirapine administration would lead loss follow-up woman . For baby deliver village , health worker inform soon possible allow take necessary measurement also give necessary assistance mother immunise baby . The qualitative component study involve use FGD pregnant woman mother neonate assess perception quality maternity care service community . In-depth interview health care provider provide maternity care service drug seller conduct explore perception quality maternity care service fever care seek pattern pregnant woman study area . Illness narrative collect pregnant woman care seek option fever prevention strategy practice pregnancy . Data Analysis : Quantitative data analyse use SPSS EPI INFO package . Differences proportion mean analyse use chi-square test , ANOVA Student t-tests . RR calculate . P value &lt; 0.05 consider significant.red significant difference show statistical significance . Qualitative data cod theme interest emerge theme master sheet use summarise data different method use collect data . Ethnographic summary , use quote content analysis method use analyse qualitative data .</detailed_description>
