	<brief_title>Claudication : Exercise Versus Endoluminal Revascularization ( CLEVER )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) major source morbidity mortality , particularly old individual . Despite high prevalence , clinician often fail diagnose PAD , particularly patient classic claudication symptom . Even individual document PAD , cardiac risk factor often aggressively treat , minority patient receive pharmacologic therapy cilostazol . Although grow body literature demonstrate value exercise rehabilitation individual peripheral vascular disease claudication , exercise rehabilitation often prescribe supervised exercise rehabilitation claudication , reimburse Medicare , rarely covered private insurance . Therefore , individual PAD intermittent claudication access supervise exercise rehabilitation . The use surgical intervention stent placement improve blood flow patient ischemic pain rest limb-threatening ischemia ( Fontaine class III IV ) remain controversial . There data suggest patient intermittent claudication revascularization stent improve exercise capacity walk time . However , patient various study often differ substantially clinical characteristic , variety technique employ , include balloon angioplasty stent , make difficult come definitive conclusion relative efficacy stenting improve functional performance . Additionally , knowledge , combination stent revascularization supervise exercise rehabilitation study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The broad objective study optimize physical functioning , increase activity level , reduce cardiovascular disease risk old individual PAD . The specific aim trial test primary hypothesis aortoiliac stenting/pharmacotherapy improve maximum walk duration ( MWD ) well supervise exercise rehabilitation/exercise maintenance/pharmacotherapy aortoiliac artery obstruction 6 month . Other aim compare two treatment group two treatment group , optimal medical care/pharmacotherapy combine stent plus supervised exercise rehabilitation , 6 month , compare 4 group regard follow variable : MWD change score 18 month , change free-living daily activity level , patient-perceived quality life ( QoL ) , cost-effectiveness . The study also perform exploratory analysis demographic biochemical risk factor atherosclerosis , include body mass index ( BMI ) , blood pressure , lipid profile , hemoglobin Alc ( HgbAlc ) , fibrinogen , C-reactive protein . An estimated 252 patient ( 30 study site ) aortoiliac insufficiency intermittent claudication randomly divide four group : optimal medical care/pharmacotherapy , supervise exercise rehabilitation/maintenance/pharmacotherapy , stent/pharmacotherapy , stent/supervised exercise rehabilitation/pharmacotherapy . Recruitment perform 28 month patient follow 18 month ; total study duration 5 year .</detailed_description>
