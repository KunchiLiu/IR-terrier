	<brief_summary>This study measure brain excitability patient succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( SSADH ) deficiency , parent . SSADH rare inherit disease change certain brain chemical affect brain cell activity . Symptoms vary greatly among patient , may include mental retardation , impaired ability coordinate movement , delay language speech development . Other symptom may include poor muscle tone , uncontrolled seizure neurological behavioral abnormality . Test find patient parent compare healthy normal volunteer . The following individual may eligible study : patient SSADH 5 24 year age ; parent patient 18 55 year age ; healthy normal child 10 17 year age ; healthy normal adult 18 55 year age . Candidates screen blood urine test . All participant undergo follow : - Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) : This procedure map brain function . A wire coil hold scalp , brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action help position coil properly . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg , subject may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . During test , electrical activity muscle record computer record device , use electrode attach skin tape . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : This test combine powerful magnet advance computer system radio wave produce accurate , detailed picture organ tissue . During scan , subject lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field , wear ear plug muffle loud noise occur electrical switch magnetic field . He speak staff member via intercom system time procedure . In addition standard MRI , subject may newer MRI test , diffusion tensor MRI magnetic resonance spectroscopy . In addition , patient parent may also undergo follow test : - Electroencephalography ( EEG ) : This test record brain wave ( electrical activity brain ) . Electrodes place scalp brain electrical activity record subject lie quietly , breathes deeply , watch flash light , sleep . Some patient may also video-EEG monitoring , involve simultaneous clinical record use video camera along brain wave recording . - Sleep study multiple sleep latency onset test ( MSLT ) : Electrodes place subject 's scalp remain subject sleep hospital overnight . MSLT do next day , start 2 hour subject wake night 's sleep . A total five 20- 30-minute nap record , every 2 hour , access daytime sleepiness . - Nerve conduction study : This test measure speed nerve conduct electrical impulse strength connection nerve muscle . A probe place skin deliver small electrical stimulus , wire tap skin record impulses .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To study cortical excitability , electroencephalography pattern , nerve conduction velocity , sleep pattern , succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( SSADH ) deficiency , rare autosomal recessive pediatric neurotransmitter disease associate elevated level brain gamma aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , major inhibitory neurotransmitter . The clinical phenotype include mental retardation , epilepsy , neuropsychiatric manifestation . Study Population : Patients SSADH deficiency , parent patient ( obligate heterozygote ) , healthy volunteer . Design : This natural history study subject series neurophysiological test . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) non-invasive technique allow measure cortical excitation inhibition . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) measure baseline brain electrical activity . Nerve conduction study measure speed conduction impulses peripheral nerve . Polysomnography record sleep cycle associate eye movement , muscle potential , heart rate , respiration . Outcome measure : Motor cortex excitability threshold , pair pulse facilitation , pair pulse inhibition TMS main outcome measure . Values compare across 4 group patient , carrier , adult child healthy volunteer . Additional measure include nerve conduction velocity , EEG frequency , sleep pattern .</detailed_description>
