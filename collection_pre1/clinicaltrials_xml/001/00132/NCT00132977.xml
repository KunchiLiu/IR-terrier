	<brief_summary>Patients heart failure pump action ventricle one ventricle contract ventricle . This uncoordinated ( unsynchronized ) pump due delay stimulation leave ventricle increase size . Pacing right left side heart ( cardiac resynchronization therapy [ CRT ] ) proven effective treatment heart failure ( HF ) . Current market-approved device combine pace ( CRT ) shocking ( implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ ICD ] ) therapy patient severe heart failure risk develop life-threatening heart rhythm . These device provide electrical pacing stimulus ventricle may help heart contract coordinate way improve heart failure symptom . The investigational portion trial involve implantation market-approved CRT implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( CRT-D ) system patient meet current criterion CRT implant . In order receive CRT-D implant today , patient must heart failure symptom , weaken heart muscle , uncoordinated pump heart . To demonstrate uncoordinated pump heart , test ( electrocardiogram [ ECG ] ) do . It believe use different test ( echocardiogram ) measure whether uncoordinated pump present , patient identify benefit CRT-D therapy . This study look whether patient identify use echocardiogram test show benefit CRT-D therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.0 Problem Interest Patients heart failure pump action ventricle one ventricle contract ventricle . This uncoordinated ( unsynchronized ) pump due delay stimulation leave ventricle increase size . Pacing right left side heart ( cardiac resynchronization therapy [ CRT ] ) proven effective treatment heart failure . Current market-approved device combine pace ( CRT ) shocking ( ICD ) therapy patient severe heart failure risk develop life-threatening heart rhythm . These device provide electrical pacing stimulus ventricle time may help heart contract coordinate way improve heart failure symptom . The investigational portion trial involve implantation market-approved CRT implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( CRT-D ) system patient meet current criterion CRT implant . In order receive CRT-D implant today , patient must heart failure symptom , weaken heart muscle , uncoordinated pump heart . To demonstrate uncoordinated pump heart , test ( ECG ) do . It believe use different test ( echocardiogram ) measure whether uncoordinated pump present , patient identify benefit CRT-D therapy . 2.0 Study Summary Testing perform determine patient eligible study . An EKG ( electrical trace heart ) perform . They ask complete 6- minute hall walk test provide information regard ability exercise conduct daily activity . An echocardiogram tissue Doppler imaging ( ultrasound heart ) perform determine heart muscle contract . Results echocardiogram determine patient eligible participate study . The device system implant consist St. Jude Medical CRT-D three pace lead ( insulted wire carry electrical energy device heart ) . One lead place upper right chamber heart ( atrium ) , second lead place low right chamber heart ( right ventricle ) third lead place within vein run along outside heart position location near leave low chamber heart ( left ventricle ) . A randomization visit occur approximately 14 day implant . Patients randomize ( like flip coin ) one two group . Each patient equal chance randomize either two group . One group receive cardiac resynchronization treatment ( CRT ON ) group receive cardiac resynchronization treatment ( CRT OFF ) . Patients CRT OFF group receive cardiac resynchronization treatment 6 month randomization doctor determines appropriate . Prior randomization program device , follow test complete : - Quality Life Questionnaire - contain 21 question provide information heart failure affect patient 's daily life . - EKG - 6-Minute Hall . - Cardiopulmonary Exercise Stress Testing ( CPX ) - measure amount oxygen use body exercise treadmill breathe special breathing tube - Echocardiogram Follow-up visit occur 3 6 month follow randomization every 6 month thereafter end study . The test perform randomization visit ( Quality Life Questionnaire , EKG , 6 minute hall walk , CPX echocardiogram ) repeat 6-month follow-up visit . Additionally , visit include review patient 's condition current medication evaluation CRT-D device . 3.0 How Will Research Advance Scientific Knowledge and/or Human Health ? It hop pace low chamber heart patient feel well . They may able activity few symptom . In addition , information gather study add understand treatment option patient heart failure . 4.0 What Current Standard Care ? Alternative treatment St. Jude Medical CRT-D system ( include leave heart lead ) currently available include implantation standard ICD system and/or treatment medication .</detailed_description>
