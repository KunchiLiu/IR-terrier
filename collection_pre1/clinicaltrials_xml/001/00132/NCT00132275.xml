	<brief_summary>Viral upper respiratory infection occur frequently childhood ( 6-8 per year ) , part , self-limited episode resolve spontaneously require antibiotic therapy . Acute otitis medium acute bacterial sinusitis frequent complication viral upper respiratory infection benefit treatment antibiotic . Acute bacterial sinusitis one common diagnose ambulatory practice , age group , account estimate 25 million physician office visit annually . It essential distinguish patient experience uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infection acute bacterial sinusitis avoid excessive use antibiotic patient benefit . This especially important escalation antibiotic resistance among bacteria commonly cause acute bacterial sinusitis , acute otitis medium pneumonia . Inappropriate use antibiotic major contributor problem antimicrobial resistance - problem dramatically increase cost complexity treatment . To improve diagnosis treatment patient acute bacterial sinusitis reduce inappropriate use antibiotic , clinical guideline develop three national organization : American Academy Pediatrics , Sinus Allergy Health Partnership Centers Disease Control Prevention . Traditionally , diagnosis acute bacterial sinusitis suspect basis clinical sign symptom confirm performance image ( either plain radiograph , compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging ) . All three guideline recommend diagnosis treatment acute bacterial sinusitis base clinical criterion alone without confirmation image laboratory data . Although similarity different guideline suggest widespread consensus use clinical criterion diagnose acute bacterial sinusitis , virtually evidence support position . Specific Aim 1 project evaluate use clinical criterion , without performance image , basis diagnosis acute bacterial sinusitis . A randomized , placebo-controlled study design use determine clinical criterion propose different guideline use identify child upper respiratory symptom respond antibiotic therapy . It expect child acute bacterial sinusitis receive antimicrobial recover quickly often child receive placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Context : Bacterial infection paranasal sinus important cause morbidity child . However , infection may difficult distinguish viral upper respiratory infection . Consequently , child viral upper respiratory infection frequently treat antibiotic . The inappropriate use antibiotic viral upper respiratory infection costly responsible , least part , emergence antibiotic resistance . To improve diagnosis treatment patient acute bacterial sinusitis reduce inappropriate use antibiotic , clinical guideline develop . Three national organization recently publish different guideline diagnosis treatment acute bacterial sinusitis : American Academy Pediatrics , Sinus Allergy Health Partnership Centers Disease Control Prevention . All three guideline recommend diagnosis treatment acute bacterial sinusitis base clinical criterion without confirmation image laboratory data . Although similarity different guideline suggest widespread consensus use clinical criterion diagnose acute bacterial sinusitis , virtually evidence support position . Objectives : The objective study : 1. determine effectiveness antibiotic treatment child diagnose acute sinusitis clinical ground alone without performance sinus image 2. evaluate response antibiotic therapy placebo term financial cost insurer , patient family . Setting Participants : The study , employ prospective , randomize , double blind design conduct three primary care facility serve diverse racial socioeconomic population . Children eligible study age 1 10 year present one three clinical presentation . Group 1 comprise subject persistent disease define nasal discharge ( quality ) daytime cough ( may worse night ) persist 10 day without evidence improvement ; Group 2 patient non-persistent disease consist two subset : child nasal discharge daytime cough worsening either 6th day ( &gt; 120 hour ) symptoms [ worsen manifest new onset document fever ( temperature &gt; 100.5o F ) substantial increase nasal discharge cough ] child severe disease define documented temperature least 102o F purulent ( thick , colored opaque ) nasal discharge present concurrently least 3 consecutive day ( 68-72 hour ) . Main Outcome Measure : Will comparison proportion child complete resolution ( cure ) respiratory symptom treatment group ( amoxicillin potassium clavulanate placebo ) . Secondary outcome measure include proportion child treatment group : 1. cure 72 hour antibiotic therapy , 2. fail therapy , 3. relapse 10 30 day entry treatment group , 4. develop adverse event treatment interval study . Other outcome measure total expense incur health care system , patient family course study parental impression whether child receive active drug placebo . Statistical Analyses : Analysis do , use Chi square statistic determine significance difference proportion patient treatment group ( antibiotic versus placebo ) sustain complete resolution respiratory symptom . A separate analysis do child persistent non-persistent presentation . Analysis also do secondary outcome measure . For child enrol trial , direct medical cost calculate compare treatment group , include cost antibiotic , hospitalization , emergency room service , non-study related office visit , antibiotic ( study medication ) , medication prescribe over-the counter medication use . Indirect medical cost assess compare : 1. number sick day , 2. number day parent/s could work due child sick , 3. number day alternative day care arrangement necessary sick child . Confounders Included Study : The study design , prospective , randomize double blind , average , effective way control potential confounders . Because investigator anticipate age clinical severity may impact substantially response therapy , group stratify two variable . Biases Addressed : The prospective , randomize double blind study design minimize introduction bias . To insure generalizability result , study conduct among three different clinical population : rural , urban indigent urban middle class . Strict eligibility criterion outcome measure employ three clinical site study perform .</detailed_description>
