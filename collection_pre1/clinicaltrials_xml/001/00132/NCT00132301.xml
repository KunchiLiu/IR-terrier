	<detailed_description>VA Cooperative Study # 553 design prospectively evaluate efficacy early adjuvant chemotherapy use docetaxel prednisone add standard care patient potentially cure radical prostatectomy high risk relapse . The standard care surveillance , addition androgen deprivation time biochemical relapse . This study assess effect add early chemotherapy standard care progression free survival Veterans high risk progression prostatectomy . The ability radical prostatectomy cure prostate cancer therefore prevent morbidity mortality associate progression metastatic disease depend effectively treating local potential systemic disease . In United States alone , 80,000 men per year treat prostatectomy cure disease . Because 20 % men find locally advanced high-grade disease , risk relapse morbidity prostate cancer . Although androgen deprivation , radiation therapy , chemotherapy consider potentially effective adjuvant modality localize prostate cancer , randomize study support utility treatment standard care . Ultimately , androgen independent prostate cancer , cause morbidity patient . Docetaxel base chemotherapy show prolong survival induce responses 80 % patient androgen independent disease , generate enthusiasm use chemotherapy early treatment prostate cancer . This study design test value adjuvant chemotherapy improve progression free survival , critical preventing morbidity mortality relapse patient clinically localize , high risk , prostate cancer . After patient stratify PSA , Gleason score , tumor stage , presence positive margin , plan use adjuvant radiation therapy , study randomize 300 patient 30 VA site , prostatectomy , standard care docetaxel prednisone administer every 3 week 18 week . Patients would observe PSA minimum one maximum five year . The study design 90 % power detect reduction 5-year progression rate 60 % 45 % ( 15 % absolute difference , 25 % relative difference ) . At end study period ( October 31 , 2012 ) , patient study continue passively follow three year . The follow-up study involve centralized remote access participant ' medical record obtain information PSA level study endpoint . Prostate cancer lead cause malignancy Veterans , second lead cause death . Patients high risk , localized disease account 70 % cancer deaths patient treated cure radical prostatectomy . Effective adjuvant therapy critical reduce suffer death prostate cancer . The VA Cooperative Studies Program uniquely place address question . The VA longstanding history important study prostate cancer , significantly change way urologic oncologist treat patient disease . The incidence prostate cancer old , male population substantial , number Veterans treat prostatectomy continue rise , incidence high risk prostate cancer Veterans great typically find community . For reason , carry study within VA VA Cooperative Studies Program optimal way determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy benefit men high risk prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
