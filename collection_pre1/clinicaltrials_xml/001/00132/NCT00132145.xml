	<brief_summary>Vascular disease ( cardiac event , stroke , peripheral vascular disease ) remain number one killer Canadian society well lead cause hospitalization day spend hospital . A 1996 estimate place Ontario 's vascular disease financial burden $ 5.5 billion total . Any intervention lower vascular risk , direct impact quantity quality life cost health care . Further integration health professional team focus chronic disease management individual population also ripe evaluation . Increased collaboration family physician , physician specialist , nurse practitioner , pharmacist generally think beneficial patient outcome , literature inconclusive cost-effectiveness unproven . In addition , combine centralize electronic up-to-date information patient 's status evidence-based recommendation ability communicate either electronically phone expect result improve access care , quality care , continuity care increase cost-effectiveness chronic disease management . COMPETE III build researcher ' previous work study electronic vascular track decision support system share patient physician , combine clinical care coordinator automate telephone support system . The researcher evaluate impact vascular risk process outcomes , perceive usefulness , ease use , need improvement , medication adherence , quality life patient goal motivation . Study hypothesis : Patients increase risk vascular event , connect family physician , medical specialist care coordinator via electronic network ( Web , fax telephone ) share intensive tracking , advice support program , low vascular risk usual care .</brief_summary>
