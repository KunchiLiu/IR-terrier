	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid work treat patient progressive stage IV breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth</brief_summary>
