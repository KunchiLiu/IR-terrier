	<brief_title>A Trial Intermittent Treatment Prevention Malaria Senegalese Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In country Sahel sub-Sahel , malaria transmission highly seasonal . Nevertheless , mortality morbidity malaria may high month year malaria transmission take place , especially child . It show previously The Gambia elsewhere area seasonal malaria transmission , mortality morbidity malaria child reduce substantially regular administration anti-malarial drug period risk ( chemoprophylaxis ) . However , chemoprophylaxis difficult sustain . Intermittent preventative treatment ( IPT ) adapt form chemoprophylaxis anti-malarial drug give fixed less frequent interval chemoprophylaxis , allow blood concentration anti-malarial drug fall inhibitory concentration period drug administration . This approach malaria control use first pregnant woman among highly effective . However , recently , also use infant ( IPTi ) anti-malarials give time vaccine administer . This approach likely effective area high transmission high proportion severe case malaria occur child first year life . IPTi likely less effective reduce burden malaria area seasonal malaria transmission many case severe malaria occur old child . Intermittent preventative treatment child ( IPTc ) possible approach control malaria area main burden malaria old child . Thus , investigator undertake study determine effective approach would prevent malaria Senegal . Objectives : The primary objective study determine whether administration one dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate Senegalese child age 6 week 59 month three occasion malaria transmission season would reduce significantly incidence clinical attack malaria . Secondary objective determination incidence side effect child receive IPTc ; impact IPTc prevalence molecular marker resistance SP sample positive Plasmodium falciparum ; effect IPTc incidence malaria rainy season follow intervention . Study Area : The study conduct Niakhar , rural area centre Senegal malaria transmission seasonal , nearly transmission take place three four month period . The entomological inoculation rate area 10 infectious bite per person per year . Study Population : All child age 6 week 59 month reside study area eligible join study . There exclusion criterion ( see ) . Study Procedure : A series meeting hold member community trial undertaken explain purpose . The family potentially eligible child visit ask wished child join trial . If case , inform consent obtain . Children allocate one eight randomisation group ( four active drug four placebo ) . At start malaria transmission season , study child examine finger-prick blood sample obtain determination pack cell volume preparation thick blood film microscopy . A drop blood collect onto filter paper store subsequent molecular study . Children anaemic treat . A similar survey conduct end malaria transmission season . Following initial evaluation child treat either single dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine artesunate matching placebo . Treatment repeat two occasion separate period month . After round drug administration randomly select group child visit parent guardian ask side effect relate drug administration . Surveillance clinical attack malaria undertaken detection study child present one clinic study area treatment febrile illness weekly home visit . In year follow treatment trial , child randomise previously receive active drug placebo follow another rainy season occurrence clinical attack malaria detect described . Blood film stain Giemsa examine malaria parasites two experienced microscopist . Parasite DNA extract filter paper sample child parasitaemic examine mutation dhfr dhps gene associate resistance pyrimethamine sulphonamides respectively . Trial End-Points : The primary trial end-point incidence clinical attack malaria child receive IPTc placebo . Clinical malaria define episode fever ( temperature record 37.5 degree Celsius high history fever within previous 24 hour ) cause could find presence P. falciparum parasitaemia density 3,000 parasite per microlitre great . This parasite density choose show previously appropriate fever threshold study area . Secondary end-points include incidence side effect child group , change prevalence resistance marker incidence clinical malaria year follow main trial . Sample Size : It assume basis previous information child control group would experience average 0.4 clinical attack malaria malaria transmission season . On basis assumption , trial 540 child arm would 80 % power 5 % level significance detect 30 % reduction incidence clinical attack malaria 90 % power detect 40 % reduction include allowance 10 % drop-out surveillance period . Monitoring : The trial monitor independent Data , Safety Monitoring Board review study protocol , standard operating procedure analytical plan .</detailed_description>
