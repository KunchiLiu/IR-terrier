	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) treat primary dystonia . Patients dystonia muscle spasm cause uncontrolled twist repetitive movement abnormal posture . Medical therapy available , patient get adequate relief abnormal movement pain associate . DBS surgical procedure interrupt neuronal circuit globus pallidus interna ( Gpi ) subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) - area basal ganglia brain work correctly patient dystonia . This result decrease movement therefore may lessen patient ' symptom pain . The study also examine physiology dystonia determine whether treatment effect DBS Gpi differ significantly DBS STN . Patients 18 year age old primary cervical dystonia respond medical treatment botulinum toxin ( Botox ) may eligible study . Candidates screen blood urine test , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI , see ) brain . Each participant undergo follow test procedure : - Magnetic resonance imaging . This procedure do implantation stimulators verify position electrode . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . The patient lie table move scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The procedure usually last 45 90 minute , patient ask lie still 15 minute time . - Transcranial magnetic stimulation . This procedure map brain function . A wire coil hold scalp , brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . During stimulation , patient may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg , patient may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . During stimulation , electrical activity muscle record computer , use electrode attach skin tape . - Neurologic evaluation . Before DBS , patient 's dystonia measure standardized rating scale call Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Scale ( TWSTRS ) . - DBS treatment . Patients randomly assign electrode implant either Gpi STN area basal ganglion . The electrodes stimulate brain DBS therapy . Before surgery , frame secure patient 's head , MRI scan do . DBS involve make two small incision two small hole skull , open line around brain , locate Gpi STN , secure electrode place , connect pulse generator place skin collar bone . In addition , surgery , patient ask move certain muscle . The muscle activity record gain well understanding physiology movement . After surgery , MRI scan do confirm placement electrode . - Stimulation evaluation . After surgery , patient ' movement evaluate stimulation . The change movement function videotape score accord rating scale . The optimal stimulation setting determine stimulators adjust accordingly . Neurologic evaluation TWSTRS scale repeat 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 12 month surgery , stimulators adjust need . Some evaluation videotape .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : For patient cervical dystonia fail medical therapy , stereotactic deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) globus pallidus interna ( Gpi ) subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) provide significant symptom improvement , know site provide maximum benefit physiologic mechanisms improvement may occur . The study goal determine DBS Gpi STN provide significant clinical improvement patient primary cervical dystonia , whether anatomic DBS site ( either ) provide optimal improvement , gain deeper insight underlie pathophysiology disorder . Study population : Adult patient medically refractory primary cervical dystonia make-up study population . Patients primary cervical dystonia suffer wide range symptom include physical deformity , speech difficulty , swallow dysfunction , visual problem , intractable pain , result inability care . Design : We propose place DBS electrode ( use microelectrode guidance ) bilaterally either Gpi STN medically refractory cervical dystonia patient . Physiological study perform compare clinical change understand mechanism action DBS underlie pathophysiology cervical dystonia . Outcome measure : Clinical effectiveness DBS Gpi STN measure Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Scale monitor time determine effectiveness DBS ideal anatomic stimulation site . Electrophysiologic outcome measure obtain determine underlie pathophysiology cervical dystonia , mechanism action DBS .</detailed_description>
