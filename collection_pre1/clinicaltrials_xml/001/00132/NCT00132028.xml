	<brief_title>Vorinostat Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Advanced Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response probability ( complete , complete unconfirmed , partial ) patient relapse refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma . II . To estimate 1-year progression-free survival overall survival patient relapse refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat SAHA . III . To assess toxicity profile SAHA patient population . IV . To perform gene expression profile tumor tissue treatment order explore preliminary manner association response specific gene expression result . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral vorinostat twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course therapy beyond CR . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
