	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well vorinostat work treat patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cavity cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , vorinostat , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vorinostat may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 6-month progression-free survival rate patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cavity cancer treat vorinostat . II . Determine toxicity drug , term frequency severity adverse reaction patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine clinical response rate ( partial response complete response ) patient treat drug . II . Determine duration progression-free survival overall survival patient treated drug . III . Determine impact prognostic variable ( e.g. , platinum sensitivity , performance status , cellular histology ) patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive oral vorinostat twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-60 patient accrue study within approximately 1 year .</detailed_description>
