	<brief_title>Comparing Allergenic Effects 3 German Cockroach Extracts Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cockroach allergens appear major cause inner city asthma . Because suspected relationship domestic cockroach specie allergy asthma symptom , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) want standardize cockroach allergen vaccine use U.S. Allergen standardization comprise two important component : selection reference preparation allergenic extract selection procedure compare manufacture product reference allergen extract . Adults study expose different dos 3 German cockroach allergen extract via intradermal skin test . Participants study adult history allergic disease asthma sensitive German cockroach allergen test . Participants 2 visit study : screening session test session . At screen , participant ask complete screening questionnaire undergo target physical exam , vital sign measurement , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) test . Premenopausal woman also urine collect pregnancy test . At screen session , 15-minute prick/puncture test administer skin forearm propose standard allergen extract , histamine ( positive control ) , diluent ( negative control ) . Skin erythema ( swell ) response injection record . Some participant may continue test session day screen session ; others participate test session second study visit within 4 week study screen . At start test session , participant ask complete questionnaire demographic , history airway disease previous skin testing , current medication use . For participant whose test session occurs different day screen session , vital sign measurement PEF reading occur premenopausal woman urine collect . Blood collection occur prior skin test . Intradermal skin test consist injection participant 's back multiple dos 3 different extract German cockroach allergen . Each 3 extract require 4 7 injection , depend response dose . Erythema skin response dilution record . Participants observe least 1 hour intradermal skin test safety precaution . After observation period , participant undergo additional PEF testing assess adverse reaction skin test procedure . Participants may give antihistamine relieve itching .</detailed_description>
