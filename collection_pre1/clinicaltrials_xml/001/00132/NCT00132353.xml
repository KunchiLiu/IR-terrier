	<brief_summary>This training protocol two objective : 1 ) train NINDS fellows specialize technique diagnose neurological disorder , 2 ) gather data healthy volunteer patient various disorder need test diagnose disorder nerve , muscle , area brain control movement . Healthy volunteer patient neurological disorder nerve muscle require specialize diagnostic testing may eligible study . Candidates must 21 year age old . They screen medical history neurological examination . Immediately screen , participant undergo one two follow test : - Transcranial magnetic stimulation : This procedure map brain function . A wire coil hold scalp , brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg , subject may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . During stimulation , electrical activity muscle record computer , use electrode ( small metal disk ) attach skin tape . - Electromyography ( EMG ) : This test measure electrical activity muscle use diagnose problem nerve muscle . For surface EMG , electrodes file conductive gel tap skin . Needle EMG involve insert needle muscle record electrical activity . Single fiber EMG use specialized needle allow record single muscle fiber . The needle inserted muscle subject ask tense muscle slightly . - Nerve conduction study : This test measure speed nerve conduct electrical impulse strength connection nerve muscle . It do tap wire skin record impulse place probe skin deliver small electrical stimulus . - Near-nerve recording : This test nerve conduction study use measure responses small nerve . It use needle place skin record nerve response . - Quantitative sensory testing : This test measure well subject feel vibration cold . A probe vibrate cool attach subject 's finger foot . The subject press button feel stimulus . A computer adjust intensity stimulus find low level subject feel . - Nerve ultrasound : This test use sound wave examine nerve . Warm gel apply skin probe hold skin surface .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This training protocol . The goal protocol train fellow advance physiological technique use diagnose neurological disorder . A secondary objective protocol gather normative data diagnostic neurophysiologic test . Study population : Patients healthy adult volunteer may study protocol . Patients must clinical indication diagnostic test . Most patient enrol primary NIH protocol , protocol serve secondary protocol . Occasionally , patient enrol protocol primary protocol refer hospital participate NINDS fellowship training program . Healthy adult study fellows-in-training practice new test procedure provide normative data require change instrumentation laboratory technique . Design : Testing perform outpatient clinic visit . One two follow procedure may perform clinically indicate : single fiber EMG , macro-EMG , near-nerve recording , single-pulse transcranial peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation , quantitative sensory testing , nerve conduction study , electromyography , nerve ultrasonography , autonomic testing . Outcome measure : This training protocol . No research carry protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS : Adult patient , age 18 year old , clinical indication diagnostic procedure enrol Suspected disorder neuromuscular transmission , myasthenia gravis Suspected Central demyelinate disorder multiple sclerosis Suspected Myelopathy Suspected motor neuron disease Suspected Movement disorder impair intracortical process Suspected neuropathy myopathy Suspected autonomic dysfunction INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Healthy adult , age 18 year old , willing participate EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS : Patients implanted device , pacemaker , metal cranium ( exclude dental work ) exclude magnetic stimulation study . Children age 21 exclude , since goal protocol provide train experience . Subjects unable provide inform consent Persons undergo autonomic testing ask refrain smoking , caffeine , alcohol vigorous exercise 24 hour study . Several medication take 48 hour prior study ; include tricyclic antidepressant , antihistamine , cough cold medication , antiparkinson medication , muscle relaxant , antipsychosis medication , opioid drug , blood pressure medication . No one stop prescribe medication without discussion primary care physician though ability complete autonomic testing may affect . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Medical condition require medication affect physiological measure test History stroke , peripheral neuropathy spine surgery Implanted device metal cranium ( except dental work ) undergo magnetic stimulation Persons undergo autonomic testing ask refrain smoking , caffeine , alcohol vigorous exercise 24 hour study . Several medication take 48 hour prior study ; include tricyclic antidepressant , antihistamine , cough cold medication , antiparkinson medication , muscle relaxant , antipsychosis medication , opioid drug , blood pressure medication . No one stop prescribe medication without discussion primary care physician may exclude study . NIH employee staff may participate , except EMG Section , OCD , NINDS employee .</criteria>
