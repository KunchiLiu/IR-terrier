	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effectiveness standardize systemic therapy versus fluocinolone acetonide implant therapy treatment severe case non-infectious intermediate uveitis , posterior uveitis , panuveitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment ( MUST ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MUST trial randomize controlled clinical trial compare two treatment patient vision-threatening non-infectious intermediate uveitis , posterior uveitis , panuveitis : - local therapy fluocinolone acetonide intraocular implant affect eye ; versus - standard therapy : systemic corticosteroid therapy supplement , indicate , corticosteroid-sparing potent immuno-modulator therapy . Study ophthalmologists , clinic coordinator , patient mask treatment assignment . Masking applied determination visual function baseline , six month visit , thereafter . Patients follow death , participant withdrawal , common study closeout . Patients see baseline , one month randomization , three month randomization , every three month thereafter data collection . Both ophthalmological medical data collect evaluate outcome treatment uveitis , complication uveitis , complication therapy . Selected laboratory data related complication systemic corticosteroid therapy collect . The planned sample size 250 patient , 125 per treatment group , expect give sufficient power detect clinically important difference visual acuity outcome . Patients meet eligibility criterion detail enrol approximately 23 clinical center United States , Australia UK . Patients randomize 1:1 basis one two treatment group . The MUST Research Group receive additional funding completion MUST Trial continue follow patient enrol study additional 7 year MUST Trial Follow-up Study ( MUST FS ) . Since uveitis often chronic condition require long-term treatment , objective MUST FS evaluate outcome two treatment longer period time . The outcome specify MUST FS specify MUST Trial : visual acuity , ocular systemic side effect treatment , quality life , control ocular inflammation . The primary analysis compare outcomes original randomization group , i.e. , intention-to-treat . Secondary analysis base treatment receive . Study visit conduct every 6 month MUST FS oppose every 3 month MUST Trial . Two analysis plan public release , one 4.5 year one 7 year follow-up . The Data Safety Monitoring Board review approve analysis plan .</detailed_description>
