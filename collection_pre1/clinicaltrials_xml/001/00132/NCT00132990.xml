	<brief_title>A Multicenter Pilot Study Pallidal Deep Brain Stimulation Cervical Dystonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) globus pallidus propose treatment cervical dystonia . At present anecdotal report benefit . The objective project prospectively assess outcome DBS cervical dystonia blind manner . Our hypothesis patient refractory medical management , bilateral pallidal DBS reduce severity cervical dystonia 1 year follow . The research plan feasibility study , examine outcome 10 patient would refer surgical management due severity disease . The Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale ( TWSTR ) preform blinded neurologist completion trial .</detailed_description>
