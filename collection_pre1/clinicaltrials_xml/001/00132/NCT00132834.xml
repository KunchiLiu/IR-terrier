	<brief_summary>Current method measure asthma severity problematic use child . A measurement call exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) may useful way determine asthma severity childhood . The purpose study determine EBC measurement useful determine asthma severity asthmatic child compare currently use laboratory measure . Study hypotheses : 1 ) A broad panel EBC measure distinguish asthmatic child inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) asthmatic child routinely take ICS nonasthmatic control . 2 ) Standardized equipment methodology EBC collection , processing , storage , shipping , pH mediator measurement develop eliminate significant contamination oropharyngeal saliva allow ship process central site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current national guideline assess asthma severity several limitation use asthmatic child . One major limitation spirometric measure airflow limitation , include forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , generally reliably obtain child less 7 year age . Furthermore , child asthma essentially normal measure airflow spirometry peak flow , measurement generally useful diagnosis treatment . Previous study indicate lung-specific biomarkers inflammation , bronchial hyperresponsiveness measure , might simplify , improve , optimize guideline . Collection EBC sample may also useful ; EBC sample obtain noninvasive mean easy obtain conventional sample . However , contamination saliva issue collect EBC sample , standardization sample collection need . This study compare utility two different sample collect equipment , EcoScreen R-Tube . This study also evaluate usefulness EBC sample distinguish asthmatic child take ICS , asthmatic child take ICS , nonasthmatic child . There 2 part study . In Part A , two EBC sample collect participant . Some participant one EBC sample take EcoScreen take R-Tube ; participant sample take R-Tube . In Part B , asthmatic take ICS , asthmatic take ICS , nonasthmatics give 2 EBC sample via R-Tube . Participants ask complete questionnaire asthma symptoms allergy brief physical exam . Allergy skin prick testing , urine collection , measurement exhale nitric oxide , conventional incentive spirometry ( use obtain several measure lung function ) also occur . Participants also ask donate blood sample .</detailed_description>
