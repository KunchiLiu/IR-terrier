	<detailed_description>Purpose : To assess safety acceptability vaginal use 0.1 % 0.25 % UC-781 gel sexually active HIV-uninfected woman , male partner , sexually abstinent HIV-infected woman Design : Single-center , phase I randomize , double-blind , control trial 14 day twice-daily product control gel exposure Study population : Sexually active , HIV-uninfected woman low-risk HIV male partner ; sexually-abstinent HIV-infected woman ; age 18-45 Size : 36 sexually active HIV-uninfected woman 36 male partner ; 18 sexually abstinent HIV-infected woman Treatment regimen : Stage 1 : HIV-uninfected , sexually active woman 1 male partner per woman : 12 woman assign 0.1 % UC-781 twice daily x 14 day ; 12 woman assign 0.25 % UC-781 twice daily x 14 day ; 12 woman assign control gel twice daily X 14 day . Stage 2 : HIV-infected , abstinent woman : 12 assign 0.25 % UC-781 twice daily x 14 day ; 6 assign control gel twice daily x 14 day Study duration : Participant accrual take 6 month . Each participant follow 14 day Stage 1 21 day Stage 2 . Total study duration 9 month . Study Site : The Hope Clinic Emory University , Decatur , GA Primary Objectives : - To assess safety toxicity 0.1 % UC-781 gel 0.25 % UC-781 gel administer intravaginally twice-daily 14 day vulvar cervicovaginal mucosa sexually active HIV-uninfected woman - To assess safety toxicity 0.25 % UC-781 gel administer intravaginally twice-daily 14 day vulvar cervicovaginal mucosa sexually abstinent HIV-infected woman Secondary Objectives : - To assess acceptability 0.1 % 0.25 % UC-781 gel administer intravaginally twice-daily 14 day among HIV-uninfected , acceptability 0.25 % gel similarly administer HIV-infected woman - To assess effect study product vaginal microflora HIV-uninfected HIV-infected woman - To assess systemic absorption 0.1 % 0.25 % UC-781 gel administer intravaginally - To assess HIV viral load genital secretion HIV-infected woman 0.25 % UC-781 gel use - To assess genotypic resistance pattern HIV genital secretion peripheral blood HIV-infected woman 0.25 % UC-781 gel use - To assess acceptability 0.1 % 0.25 % UC-781 gel male sexual partner HIV-uninfected woman Primary Endpoints : The safety toxicity 0.1 % UC-781 gel 0.25 % UC-781 gel administer intravaginally twice-daily 14 day sexually-active HIV-uninfected woman 0.25 % UC-781 gel administer sexually-abstinent HIV-infected woman assess : - Macroscopic and/or microscopic evidence vulvar and/or vaginal epithelium damage , include ulceration , abrasion , severe erythema , and/or severe edema - Macroscopic and/or microscopic evidence cervical mucosal damage include ulceration , abrasion , severe erythema , and/or severe edema - Symptoms genital irritation , include burning , itch soreness - Laboratory evidence grade 3 high toxicity hematology , liver renal function attribute another cause Secondary Endpoints : Acceptability 0.1 % 0.25 % UC-781 gel use HIV-uninfected 0.25 % UC-781 gel use HIV-infected woman assess : - Proportion participant Day 14 visit indicate would 'somewhat unlikely ' 'very unlikely ' use 0.1 % 0.25 % UC-781 gel sexual intercourse future compare control gel user - Reported positive aspect use 0.1 % 0.25 % UC-781 gel compare control gel user - Reported negative aspect use 0.1 % 0.25 % UC-781 gel compare control gel user</detailed_description>
