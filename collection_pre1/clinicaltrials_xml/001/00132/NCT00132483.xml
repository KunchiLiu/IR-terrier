	<brief_summary>Summary This study look physical exercise acute ischaemic stroke . It call ExStroke Pilot Trial . Physical activity associate low risk first-time stroke . It remain unknown physical activity also associate low risk recurrent stroke . Patients ischaemic stroke 30 % 40 % risk recurrent stroke 5 year follow-up . The risk acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) death vascular disease approximately 15 % . The impact lifestyle factor risk event insufficiently cover international scientific literature . Purpose : The purpose trial examine whether level physical activity increase patient ischemic stroke , informed physical activity instruct physical training program . The occurrence new cerebro- cardiovascular event patient register . The patient randomise receive oral write information physician physiotherapist physical exercise ; control group instruction regard physical exercise . Both group receive best available therapy regard secondary stroke prevention inform lifestyle factor . Irrespective group patient randomise , patient receive best possible establish treatment regard prevention thromboses ; blood pressure control ; lipid lowering agent , necessary ; information diet , tobacco smoking , vitamin supplement . Study Design : The patient randomise centrally within 90 day stroke onset , re-examined 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month . Inclusion criteria patient ischaemic stroke , age 40 year old . In pilot trial number 300 include patient want .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ExStroke Pilot Trial : Physical Exercise After Acute Ischaemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical exercise acute ischaemic stroke . The ExStroke Pilot Trial . A randomised clinical trial . Investigation group Principal investigator : Gudrun Boysen , Professor , DMSc Department Neurology Bispebjerg University Hospital Co-investigators : 2400 Copenhagen NV Anders Pedersen , Project Nurse Lars-Henrik Krarup , MD Thomas Truelsen , MD Ph.D. Lotte Hansen , Physiotherapist Marianne Lindahl , Physiotherapist Christian Gluud , DMSc Copenhagen Trial Unit Rigshospitalet 2100 Copenhagen Ã˜ Introduction : Physical activity associate low risk first-time stroke . It unknown physical exercise reduces risk recurrent stroke . Clinicians treat stroke patient inevitably confront question reduce risk second stroke . In addition risk recurrent stroke , stroke survivor also risk suffer acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) cardiovascular complication . Efforts reduce cardiovascular risk may potentially also reduce stroke risk . Physical activity contrast sedentary lifestyle associate reduce risk first stroke , one study reduction stroke risk reach statistical significance . In Norwegian study relative risk stroke mortality 0.56 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.36 - 0.88 ) physically active woman age 70-79 year , compare woman lower physical activity . Purpose ExStroke Trial : To evaluate effect instruction physical training `` Physical Activity Scale Elderly '' ( PASE ) patient ischemic stroke . Other endpoint recurrent stroke , MI , death cause , vascular death ischaemic stroke patient randomise receive verbal instruction stroke physician/a neurologist physiotherapist concurrently write information physical exercise versus control group , receive standard information usefulness physical activity . Both group receive physiotherapy accord usual standard department patient admit . The Interventions : Physical exercise discharge hospital : Patients randomise physical exercise group shall session stroke physician/a neurologist , physiotherapist patient 's possibility wish train activity discharge discuss . In agreement patient , train program design individual patient accord patient 's resource capability . The training program patient , physician , physiotherapist agree must write ; patient keep copy training program , another copy keep patient file , third copy keep Clinical Record Form ( CRF ) . At follow-up visit level physical activity evaluate use `` Physical Activity Scale Elderly '' ( PASE ) group Copenhagen City Heart Study questionnaire physical activity . It recommend patient active group contact follow-up session physiotherapist order stimulate physical exercise . Patients control group shall receive high quality medical care , without discussion physical training , unless patient request information . Hypotheses : Several study show certain amount physical activity associate reduce risk first-ever stroke . It hypothesise certain level physical exercise patient ischaemic stroke , reduce risk subsequent cardio-vascular event . The following hypothesis test : - Level physical activity increase patient instructed physical training program . - The incidence recurrent stroke , MI , death follow ischaemic stroke lower patient receive verbal write instruction physical exercise compare control group . Outcome Measures Primary Outcome Measure : physical activity measure PASE Secondary Outcome Measure : time randomisation recurrent stroke , MI , death cause . Third Outcome Measure : time randomisation recurrent stroke , MI vascular death . Fourth Outcome Measure : frequency recurrent stroke . Fifth Outcome Measure : activity daily live measure modified Rankin Scale . Sixth Outcome Measure : quality life Seventh Outcome Measure : frequency fall fracture . Study Design : Consecutive patient , meet inclusion criterion , none exclusion criterion , ask want participate trial . Patients include soon convenient within 90 day onset ischaemic stroke . There follow-up session 3,6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month . The study randomise , single blind , parallel group , multicenter , international clinical trial . Informed Consent : Randomisation : The randomisation perform centrally randomisation block 1:1 , stratify center , sex , age , stroke severity . The Copenhagen Trial Unit ( CTU ) perform randomisation . Study Population Planned Sample Size : Patients ischaemic stroke 40 year age old include study . It unknown , level physical activity increase repeat information give patient stroke . Level physical activity evaluate accord PASE scale , expect approximately 70 mean value . Based standard deviation 50 , minimal relevant difference 20 PASE score , Type I error 5 % , Type 2 error 20 % , estimate 100 patient include two study arm . To take account withdrawal dropout , 50 % patient include arm , give total 300 patient pilot trial . Inclusion Criteria : - Subjects age 40 year old . - Patients clinical diagnosis stroke ; symptom last 24 hour . - CT-scan brain must either show new infarct normal . Patients infarcts without clinical symptom include . - Inclusion shall take place day 90 stroke onset . - Informed consent verbal write information . - The patient must able walk either unaided cane walker . Exclusion Criteria : - Patients unable understand information , cooperate , exclude . - Patients confine wheelchair bed . - CT-scanning show intracranial haemorrhage focal pathology infarction , cerebral atrophy , leucoaraiosis . - Modified Rankin score 4 5 actual stroke . - Serious medical disease AIDS , metastatic cancer , abnormality investigator feel may compromise patient 's successful participation trial . - Earlier randomisation trial . Baseline Registration : - Sex birthday - Date qualify stroke ( day , month , year ) - Type stroke - Results CT scan , ECG , Doppler examination carotid artery shall obtain - Information treatment anti-thrombotic medication treatment anti-hypertensive medication discharge index stroke - Information blood pressure inclusion - Weight height Adverse Events : Stroke patient risk adverse event occurrence fall , fracture . Follow-Up Visits : Follow-up examination take place 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 month inclusion patient trial . On visit medical history shall include information date recurrent stroke , date transient ischaemic attack ( TIA ) , date gastro-intestinal bleeding , bleed episode , date MI , fall , fracture , date serious adverse event . In case hospital admission , information diagnosis length stay shall obtain . In case death , information date death shall retrieve cause death give either baseline stroke , new stroke , cardiac disease , vascular cause , cause . On follow-up visit patient randomise `` physical exercise group '' shall repeat instruction physiotherapist exercise suggest baseline , adapt present capability patient . Such adapted instruction train program must write . The patient shall receive copy , second copy shall insert patient record , third copy case record form . On visit patient physical activity scale ( PASE ) shall complete . The interview do co-investigator , blind group patient randomise . Three Month Follow-Up : Information record follow item : - Scandinavian Stroke Scale - Modified Rankin Scale - Blood pressure - Tobacco smoke - Alcohol consumption - Antithrombotic medication - Antihypertensive medication - PASE form - Events recurrent stroke , MI , adverse event record - Quality life form 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 Month Follow-Ups : Information record three month follow-up . Ethical Considerations : It unknown whether physical exercise influence rate recurrent vascular event , MI , mortality ischaemic stroke . It , however , assume physical activity may favourably influence prognosis . Therefore , patient trial advise healthy lifestyle include possible benefit physical exercise . Those , randomise active group , addition receive special instruction physiotherapist physician . The trial shall accept local ethic committee inform , write consent requirement participation study . Participation voluntary patient choose withdraw study time . Outcome Event Adjudication Committee : The outcome event adjudication committee blindly evaluate adjudicate event death , cause death , recurrent stroke , MI traumatic event adverse event . The Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) : DSMB receive blind data Trial Data Center . The DSMB evaluate event death , cause death , recurrent stroke , MI , adverse effect . The DSMB may advise early interruption trial analysis demonstrate significant difference occurrence secondary outcome measure p &lt; 0.001 group A group B . The DSMB also follow development serious adverse event occur 2 intervention arm trial . Finance Insurance : Financial support study apply national private public fund . Insurance follow national regulation . Publication Policy : The main publication submit major peer review international journal . All investigator , include co-authors , acknowledge appendix .</detailed_description>
