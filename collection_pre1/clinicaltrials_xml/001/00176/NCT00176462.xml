	<brief_title>CINJALL : Treatment Children With Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outline Therapy : Combinations chemotherapy drug give orally , intravenously intrathecally ( directly cerebrospinal fluid spinal tap ) period roughly two half year . Therapy divide five phase : Induction ( 4 week ) : chemotherapy give produce clinical remission ( define normal blood count , absence leukemia cell blood few 5 % leukemia cell bone marrow ) . Consolidation ( 11 week ) : chemotherapy give consolidate remission . Delayed Intensification ( 7 week ) Intensive chemotherapy aim kill resistant leukemia cell give patient high risk relapse . Intensive Continuation ( approximately 1 year ) : Eight week cycle chemotherapy , give eight time . Continuation ( final year therapy ) : Eight week cycle largely oral chemotherapy , one clinic visit lumbar puncture every eight week . Irradiation : radiation give middle intensive continuation head spine patient leukemia cell find cerebrospinal fluid time diagnosis . Follow-up : After conclusion therapy , periodic office visit , initially monthly , gradually space annual visit . The purpose visit evaluate late side-effects therapy .</detailed_description>
