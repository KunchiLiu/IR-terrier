	<brief_summary>Obesity know affect concentration certain medication body . Levofloxacin commonly use antibiotic . Based investigator know levofloxacin move body , obesity may affect levofloxacin concentration . This study aim show effect obesity levofloxacin concentration . The hypothesis follow : A 750 mg intravenous ( IV ) dose levofloxacin administer severely obese , critically ill patient yield serum concentration likely therapeutic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Levofloxacin Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Severely Obese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although pharmacokinetics levofloxacin consistent various study population , obese critically ill individual likely demonstrate alter distribution clearance levofloxacin , addition potentially alter serum concentration . Thus , follow study propose address question : What effect combination critical illness severe obesity pharmacokinetics levofloxacin . The data investigation also combine obese ambulatory volunteer data accurately define effect obesity pharmacokinetic parameter levofloxacin . There comparison study . The specific aim : 1 . Characterize pharmacokinetic parameter levofloxacin obese critically ill individual : Cmax , Tmax , area concentration-time curve ( AUC ) , volume distribution , elimination rate , serum half-life , urine clearance . 2 . Determine percentage patient achieve AUC/MIC ratio* 88 , achieve 72 % non-obese , non-critically ill patient correlate efficacy . Hospitalized subject identify medical pharmacy house staff officer provide care intensive care unit computerized medication profile provide UKCMC UTMB Pharmacy Services . Once investigator determines eligibility , recommendation make enroll patient study attend physician . After obtain permission enroll subject , investigator obtain informed consent patient his/her appropriate surrogate . The decision competence make physician , conjunction family member , available . Assessment competence provide informed consent document medical record via statement : `` The patient fully assess is/is competent agree study . Family member , include patient 's surrogate , present assessment agree patient is/is competent purpose study entry . This assessment conversation family witness nurse assign patient 's care . '' The informed consent document sign original copy place patient 's medical record . No study relate order write signed consent form include medical record . Ambulatory subject identify medical staff . Participants likely recruit physician clinic sleep clinic . Research Procedures : Ambulatory volunteer admit 24 hour UTMB UK General Clinical Research Center . Hospitalized participant admit UKCMC UTMB hospital reason participation study . Each participant receive 750 mg intravenous levofloxacin dose . A peripheral intravenous catheter place arm drug administration serial blood sample . Pre-existing intravenous access utilized possible . Baseline serum chemistry complete blood count obtain individual prior levofloxacin dose screening purpose . Subjects rest supine position receive 750 mg intravenous dose levofloxacin 90 minute . Serial blood sample obtain 1.5 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 12 , 24 hour begin administration levofloxacin . Urine collection also complete 24 hour study period . Venous blood sample collect 10 ml standard red-top vacuum tube . The sample centrifuge 10-15 minute 5000 rpm , serum remove , place plastic vial suitable freezing . The sample place -80oC freezer ready shipment site assay . Urine also collect 24 hour study period ass renal function well measure drug elimination . Two aliquot extract total urine volume : one levofloxacin assay ( storage procedure ) one urine creatinine measurement ( 24 hour creatinine clearance ) . Urine aliquot serum sample transport University Kentucky College Pharmacy levofloxacin assay . Ambulatory participant University Texas Medical Branch undergo whole body potassium-40 counter scan order determine percentage adipose lean body mass . This consist subject lie supine position 30 45 minute whole body counter house General Clinical Research Center University Texas Medical Branch . The ambulatory volunteer scan 24 hour study period . Initial data collect include : age , height , weight , admit diagnosis , serum creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , fluid intake/output , concomitant medication , concomitant disease state might affect pharmacokinetics , operate room procedure , document suspected infection site , pertinent microbiological culture result , adverse drug reaction . Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics analyze assume two-compartment model first order elimination use WinNonLin 4.01 ( Pharsight Corp , Mountainview , CA ) . Patients follow 24 hour .</detailed_description>
