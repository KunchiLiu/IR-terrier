	<brief_summary>Postoperative visual loss result surgical procedure perform eye devastate outcome patient poorly understood medical community . It potentially preventable complication . Diminished blood supply optic nerve , affect anterior posterior portion optic nerve , common cause postoperative visual loss . Other , less common cause include occlusion retinal artery vein , retinal embolism cortical blindness . The incidence postoperative visual loss increase patient undergo cardiopulmonary bypass prone spinal surgery . Although etiology postoperative visual loss unknown , thought multifactorial , several potential risk factor identify , include degree low blood pressure , preoperative hematocrit , external compression eye , amount blood loss , prolonged duration surgical time lie face position . The investigator believe study unique opportunity examine mechanism responsible antecedent postoperative visual loss ( POVL ) ischemic optic neuropathy ( ION ) , devastate complication ( usually ) elective surgical procedure . The purpose research try determine potential variable responsible postoperative visual loss assist medical community devise method prevention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postoperative permanent visual loss rare devastate complication surgery estimate occur approximately 1/60,000 anesthetic . After procedure involve cardiopulmonary bypass prone spinal surgery , estimate high , 1/1600 1/1100 , respectively lead formation July 1999 Postoperative Visual Loss ( POVL ) Registry auspex American Society Anesthesia ( ASA ) Committee Professional Liability . The majority report case early 2003 associated spine surgery ( 67 % ) . Of spine case , majority due ischemic optic neuropathy ( ION ) ( 81 % ) follow central retinal artery occlusion ( 13 % ) unknown diagnosis ( 6 % ) . Central retinal artery occlusion characterize periorbital edema , cherry red spot fovea monocular blindness . It think due direct prolong extraocular pressure globe thus preventable . Direct pressure eye etiology often mention spine surgeon attempt explain form postoperative visual loss . Post anesthetic ION , affect anterior posterior portion optic nerve , however , common diagnosis . The etiology unclear hypo perfusion optic nerve associate multiple risk factor . The four patient factor obesity , hypertension , diabetes low preoperative hematocrit . There five surgical factor , include operation long duration , large blood loss , prone position , deliberate hypotension , blood replacement strategy increase tissue fluid compartment decrease hematocrit . ION occur patient head suspend Mayfield tongs ( 18 % ION case ) , virtually eliminate source external pressure . In addition , 58 % patient bilateral disease , make direct pressure less likely . Thus , POVL case appear directly relate change retinal and/or optic nerve perfusion . The visual loss associate anterior ION cause infarction watershed zone area supply posterior ciliary artery , end artery without anastomosis . Posterior optic neuropathy thought cause decreased oxygen delivery posterior portion optic nerve orbital apex entrance central retinal artery . Critical discussion perfusion eye concept ocular perfusion pressure ( OPP ) , define difference mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . Unopposed decrease MAP , increase IOP combination two may result hypo perfusion eye cause ocular infarction level retina optic nerve , lead vary degree visual loss frequently bilateral irreversible . Animal data indicate IOP increase downward head tilt supine position , possibly due increase episcleral venous pressure . Limited data awake human volunteer indicate IOP increase supine position elevate head tilt prone positioning possibly due rise episcleral venous pressure . This randomized prospective study examine effect table position intraocular pressure ocular perfusion pressure spine surgery . Subjects recruit follow preoperative visit Neurosurgical office . An informed consent obtain consent surgery sign . A visual acuity exam perform one study team member subject wear corrective lens morning surgery . The reactivity pupil also assess via penlight .</detailed_description>
