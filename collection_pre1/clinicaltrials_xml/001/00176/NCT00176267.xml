	<brief_title>Paclitaxel , Carboplatin And Low Dose Radiation As Induction Therapy In Locally Advanced Head And Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Squamous cell cancer head neck ( SCCHN ) comprise 5 % cancer , 40,000 new case diagnose annually . Surgery follow irradiation irradiation alone standard care locally advanced Stage III IV patient . With approach , few 30 % patient achieve long-term remission , recur locoregionally . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy administer prior definitive therapy response rate range 60-90 % , pathologic CR rate document 30-70 % clinical responder . However , large randomize trial show improvement overall survival . Because induction chemotherapy alone appear improve long-term disease free survival advance head neck cancer , concomitant chemotherapy radiation pursue patient locally advanced head neck cancer . The concept synergy radiation chemotherapy well establish vitro . Various schedule radiation chemotherapy utilized include weekly chemotherapy radiation , chemotherapy give every three week radiation alternate chemotherapy radiation . One novel approach capitalize synergy radiation chemotherapy use low dos fractionate radiation ( LDFRT ) chemotherapy enhancer . In vitro data suggest LDFRT enhances response p53 wild type p53 mutant cancer cell line chemotherapy . Not cell death fraction increase , development radioresistance cell line study low dos radiation utilize . This strategy translate clinical trial use four 80-cGy fraction radiation Carboplatin Paclitaxel . Preliminary result produce impressive 85 % response rate neoadjuvant regimen safe easy deliver patient locally advanced SCCHN patient . In recently publish work Belani , regimen use Carboplatin every four week combine weekly Paclitaxel improve response rate non-small cell lung cancer . The delivery chemotherapy weekly schedule would particular benefit add LDFRT , tumor cell could expose LDFRT multiple occasion per cycle induction therapy , without theoretic development radioresistance . We propose expand understand LDFRT chemotherapy use two cycle Paclitaxel Carboplatin modification Belani regimen , plus LDFRT induction therapy prior definitive treatment ( surgery radiation ) . It hop use LDFRT chemoenhancer increase response rate see induction therapy population patient .</detailed_description>
