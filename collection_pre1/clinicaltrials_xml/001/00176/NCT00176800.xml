	<brief_summary>Surgery standard care esophageal cancer many year , limited success . At present , several study underway nationwide utilize chemotherapy combine radiation therapy prior usual surgical regimen . Although treatment offer possibility improvement patient esophageal cancer , remain significant need development new drug substantially impact survival Investigators University Michigan evaluate inhibitor tumor blood vessel growth ( angiogenesis ) . Specifically , evaluate role copper angiogenesis . Copper show requirement potent stimulus angiogenesis . Previous study show Tetrathiomolybdate ( TM ) rapidly low copper level blood . The physician University Michigan study whether addition TM chemoradiation surgery may increase survival patient esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoradiation Tetrathiomolybdate ( TM ) Patients With Esophageal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pre-study evaluation include medical history , physical examination , blood laboratory evaluation , scan evaluate disease . A CT scan perform measure size subject 's tumor ( ) . The treatment phase study include : 1 . Administration Paclitaxel intravenous infusion 1 hour Days # 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . 2 . Cisplatin give intravenous infusion Paclitaxel 1 hour Days # 1 22 . 3 . Radiation treatment twice per day dose separate 6 hour , Days 1-5 , 8-12 15-19 . The subject 's esophagus surgically remove ( esophagectomy ) approximately Day # 50 . Approximately four six week surgery , subject start take Tetrathiomolybdate , one pill day mouth , two year treatment longer work control cancer . The dose may need increase 1 pill every 2 week , depend result blood test give routine basis help guide dose . Dietary Restrictions : Subjects may eat shell fish liver ( organ meat ) study due high copper content . Blood draw ( approximately 1-2 tablespoon ) take weekly subject undergo chemotherapy radiation prior surgery . Prior surgery CT scan also administer . Four six week surgery ( subject start take Tetrathiomolybdate ) , blood test ( approximately 1 teaspoon ) perform every week 2 time , monthly thereafter . This blood test check amount copper subject 's blood . When level copper lower sufficiently ( determined physician ) additional blood test baseline chest x-ray obtain . Additional blood drawn ( approximately 1-2 tablespoon ) test every 6 month first 2 year . There circumstance treatment may discontinue whether subject agrees . These circumstance include : subject 's tumor get bad despite treatment ; side effect treatment dangerous subject ; new information drug become available information suggest drug ineffective unsafe subject .</detailed_description>
