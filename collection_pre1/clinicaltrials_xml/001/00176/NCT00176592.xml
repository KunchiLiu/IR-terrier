	<brief_summary>This first comparison efficacy Betaseron Copaxone treatment relapse form MS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IV Study , Betaseron Versus Copaxone Relapsing Remitting CIS Forms MS Using Triple Dose Gad 3 T MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose perform head head comparison Interferon beta Copaxone treatment patient CIS RR form MS use acute change MRI primary outcome . The study perform two clinical practice sit Multiple Sclerosis Center University Medicine Dentistry New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School , One two FDA approve preparation higher dose interferon beta ( Betaseron ) compare standard dose every day ( QOD ) 250 ug subcutaneously ( SQ ) Copaxone 20mg SQ daily ( QD ) 70 80 patient . Although current approve plan perform monthly MRIs 1 year follow another MRI 2 year , protocol change continue perform monthly MRIs second year study patient complete first year January 31 , 2006 study end . The study use brain image 3 Tesla MRI triple dose Gadolinium primary secondary outcome several clinical cognitive measure secondary outcome . The sample size estimate detect 40-50 % difference number active MS lesion MRI two arm 1 year follow , consistent primary outcome measure . The primary outcome measure number `` combined-active '' lesion monthly MRI conclusion study , include contrast enhance lesion non-enhancing lesion long Time repetition ( TR ) scan appeared since recent examination . Several secondary MRI outcome measure study addition number enhance lesion number new lesion long TR image . We examine number patient remain `` combined-active disease-free '' duration study number `` combined-active disease-free '' scan . Apart traditional method analysis reader blind patient clinical status therapy , objective volumetric analysis carry . Making use automate manual technique , determine overall burden disease ( volume lesion long TR scan ) , burden active disease ( volume brain enhancement ) burden chronic disease ( volume lesion markedly hypointense T1 ) . Another MRI outcome measure detection diffusion anisotropy difference , MR spectroscopy , magnetization transfer ratio summarize Appendix 5 . These new technique show promise detect disease detect conventional MRI ( 13 , 37 ) . In addition MRI , several clinical cognitive outcome measure use secondary analysis . These include number severity relapse measure different method , change disability measure Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) , Neurological Rating Scale , Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite ( MSFC ) . The cognitive measure subject 's neurocognitive function measure standard neurocognitive examination obtain licensed neuropsychologist Cognitive Stability Index ( CSI ) , novel Internet-based test cognitive function addition Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ( PASAT ) , component MSFC .</detailed_description>
