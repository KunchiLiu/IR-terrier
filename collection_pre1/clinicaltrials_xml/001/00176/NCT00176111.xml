	<brief_title>Effects Local Anesthetic Saline Solution Peripheral Nerve Stimulation â€“ Randomised Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using electrical nerve stimulation perform peripheral nerve help control needle position relation nerve therefore may increase likelihood successful nerve block . Defining minimal stimulate current accept also may help avoid direct contact nerve needle accidental endoneural injection subsequent nerve lesion . In recent year many report several nerve , part thereof plexus anesthetise use multiple injection approach . That , nerve close proximity subsequently block use nerve stimulator locate . It clear though , whether nerve may already partially anesthetise situation whether would impair correct use peripheral nerve stimulator . The aim study examine excitability peripheral nerve inject small amount local anesthetic agent saline solution proximity nerve .</detailed_description>
