	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine whether adjunctive use bupropion SR context psychoeducational program modify people schizophrenia might improve likelihood successful abstinence population . If bupropion SR effective reduce cigarette smoking , important determine decrease nicotine intake associate worsen psychotic , anxiety depressive symptom . In addition , would important determine effect reduction nicotine stimulation would patient 's cognitive functioning , nicotinic receptor show regulate attention memory function , hypothesize function normalize acute nicotine administration people schizophrenia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Bupropion SR Placebo Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After obtain consent , patient enter two week stabilization phase follow 14 week treatment phase . The treatment phase begin 9 session group therapy lead clinic nurse train educational model American Cancer Association . Subjects begin double-blind , randomize , placebo control medication phase treatment follow third group session , two week prior establish quit day . Patients receive either bupropion SR 150mg twice day ( start 150mg day three day ) placebo addition usual medication regimen . Patients offer use nicotine replacement form Nicorette gum quit day week 8 , end group therapy course . Correct use gum review group . Following completion group therapy course , patient continue assigned medication group study completion . Prior start study , subject receive physical exam ECG , one last calendar year . All woman pregnancy test , pregnant woman exclude study . If already complete , follow Index Assessments complete : Demographic form 1 2 , SCID , Schedule Deficit Syndrome , Patient Psychiatric Medical History Form . The Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence , symptom/ functional rating ( BPRS , SANS ) , Extrapyramidal Rating Scale , body weight , urinary cotinine level obtain stabilization treatment week 2 , 4 , 8 , 14 . The MPRC Side-effect Check List obtain week 2 ( start study medication ) biweekly thereafter throughout end treatment phase . Expired carbon monoxide level measure weekly study . Patients receive 60 minute neuropsychological test battery stabilization end study . The test battery consist Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test , Brief Visuospatial Memory Test , Symbol Digit , Letter Number Sequencing , Distractibility CPT . Similarly , stabilization , treatment week 8 , study completion ( treatment week 14 ) , subject meet MIRECC rater complete Smoking History ( stabilization ) , Change Assessment Scale , Temptation Smoke Scale , Decisional Balance Scale , Smoking Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale . At time point also antipsychotic blood level draw . Patients see follow-up assessment 6 month one-year . Urine cotinine level , expire CO level , Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence obtain time . A total fifty subject recruit Maryland Psychiatric Research Center , Outpatient Research Program ( MPRC ORP ) , Key Point Southwest Mental Health Center , Revisions , Inc. , The Baltimore , VA . The sample consist 50 patient meet following inclusion exclusion criterion : Inclusion Criteria : 1 . DSM-IV diagnosis Schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder 2 . Age : 18-64 3 . Regular half pack day smokers 4 . Score least 4 Nicotine Dependency Test Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Seizure disorder , Neurologic illnesses , family history seizures 2 . A medical condition could manifest psychiatrically 3 . Currently experience depressive episode 4 . Active substance abuse 5 . Currently receive bupropion 6 . Pregnant woman 7 . Children ( &lt; 18 year age ) 8 . Two consecutive sodium level 130 mmol/L less Patients pay time inconvenience may experience participation . An educational informed consent process utilized , patient able give inform voluntary write consent able participate study . Before patient accept study , must : 1. give oral write consent ; 2. pas MPRC evaluation sign consent test document factual understanding research participation ( see Appendix ) ; 3. aware alternative treatment , alternative clinical care available ; 4. aware right withdraw , aware appropriate contact person wish withdraw ; 5. aware may family member significant friend involve informed consent procedure . MPRC booklets describe research procedure clarify difference research clinical care standard clinical care make available potential subject , refer clinician , interested family member . Informed consent form preview ad hoc committee assure MPRC IRB feedback perspective family advocate , recipient care , forensic psychiatry , service system administration . Primary outcome measure : 1 . The Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence , expire CO level , urine cotinine use determine bupropion SR , use adjunct antipsychotic medication , superior placebo help patient schizophrenia improve chance smoke cessation . 2 . Neuropsychological testing use determine effect smoke cessation patient 's attention memory function . Secondary outcome measure : 1 . BPRS , SANS , EPRS , body weight use determine effect bupropion SR smoking cessation patient ' positive negative symptom , level functioning , physical health . 2 . To determine whether response Smoking Consequences Questionnaire , Change Assessment Scale , Temptation Smoke Scale , Decisional Balance Scale , Smoking Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale correlate successful smoking cessation . In preliminary study , able detect 44 % reduction expire CO bupropion treatment . This represent change 1.2 SDs , large effect size . In order detect effect propose double-blind study , two-sided test alpha=.05 power 0.80 , would need 10 subject treatment group . Since open label study design may inflate observed effect , decide include 20 subject group . The primary analytic approach use repeat measure ANCOVA , adjustment baseline expire CO level , treatment assignment group factor expire CO level repeat measure . Since group receive group therapy , value end first week group ( start bupropion placebo ) use baseline compare patient bupropion versus placebo . A similar approach use analyze symptom neurocognitive measure . The major risk study stress symptom associate nicotine withdrawal . Depressed mood , insomnia , irritability , anger , anxiety , difficulty concentrating , restlessness , decreased heart rate , increase appetite common . Risks associate use bupropion SR include allergic reaction ( commonly skin rash itch ) , dry mouth , insomnia , dizziness , tremor , headache . Of , dry mouth insomnia common . The risk seizure , use sustained -release bupropion dose range use study , 0.1 % , rate similar antidepressant . Because bupropion weak dopamine agonist , possible subject may experience worsen psychosis . However , work MPRC ORP place similar dopamine agonist show worsen baseline psychotic symptom , patient remain antipsychotic . There study support safety combine antipsychotic medication selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor bupropion . However , always potential unforeseen drug interaction , addition bupropion exist medication regimen . Use Nicorette gum associate sore throat mouth , hiccup , tire jaw , nausea gastrointestinal symptom , rarely mouth ulcer . Nicotine intoxication overuse gum unlikely , release slowly gastrointestinal tract undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism . The neuropsychological test associate minimal risk . Some subject may find test stressful boring . The likelihood occur unlikely . However , frequent break test allow insure subject become overwhelm . To protect privacy confidentiality , patient 's welfare safeguard responsible , systematically control procedure collection information research clinical purpose . Recorded information research purpose identify code number rather name . Information gather keep research chart maintain lock file cabinet . Published presented material relate project traceable specific individual .</detailed_description>
