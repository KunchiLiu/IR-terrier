	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To assess MTD low-dose fractionate radiation combination Gemcitabine Paclitaxel recurrent metastatic head neck cancer relapse set . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To assess quantitative toxicity group patient treat regimen . 2 . To assess response rate group patient treat regimen 3 . To investigate exploratory manner , association tumor marker p53 , p21waf1/cip1 , bcl-xL , bcl-2 bax ( evaluated immunohistochemistry ) response rate use pre- post-treatment biopsy . This study seek establish safety gemcitabine , paclitaxel low-dose radiation recurrent , metastatic head neck cancer two-stage dose escalation study , first Gemcitabine dose escalation low-dose radiation escalation . Treatment Schedule : Treatment administer inpatient outpatient basis . - Gemcitabine:2000 3000mg/m2 IV day 1 15 every 28 day 30-60 minute . - Paclitaxel : 150 mg/m2 IV day 1 15 every 28 day 60 minute . - Low Dose Radiation : 50-80 cGy twice daily day 1 , 2 , 15 , &amp; 16 every 28 day least 4 hour apart .</detailed_description>
