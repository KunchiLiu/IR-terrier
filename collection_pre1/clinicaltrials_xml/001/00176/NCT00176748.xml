	<brief_summary>This study do find good bad effect investigational drug approve sale , call AG-013736 . Tumors need blood vessel order continue grow , AG-013736 think work play role prevent new blood vessel grow . We want see AG-013736 effect disease make tumor small , long . We also want test safety [ effect body ] AG-013736 measure amount AG-013736 get blood . AG-013736 give 140 patient cancer study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Patients With Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Cancer Society estimate 23,600 new case thyroid cancer ( 5,960 men 17,640 woman ) annually United States , 1,460 people ( 620 men 840 woman ) die disease.1 It common malignancy endocrine system . Depending upon type stage , thyroid cancer may treat surgery , radioactive iodine ( 131I ) , hormone treatment , external radiation , chemotherapy . The systemic therapy metastatic disease remain palliative new agent find might afford good prognosis . Thyroid tumor often vascular , decrease number blood vessel supply tumor may starve needed nutrient . An approach block growth blood vessel supply tumor inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase ( VEGFR TK ) signal pathway . The VEGFR TK inhibitor SU011248 produce 4 objective response 15 patient receive drug Phase 1 studies.2 AG-013736 another VEGFR TK inhibitor . Besides potential anti-angiogenesis property VEGFR TK inhibition , also additional potential antitumor platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) TK inhibition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria To eligible study , subject must satisfy follow criterion : 1 . Histologically documented thyroid cancer metastasis . 2 . Failure 131I control disease 131I appropriate therapy ( eg , due lack iodine uptake tumor ) . 3 . No expectation effect prior anticancer therapy . 4 . At least 1 target lesion , define RECIST ( Appendix C ) , irradiate . New lesion develop previously irradiate field may use site measurable disease assume criterion meet . All target lesion must unidimensional diameter least 2 cm . ( 1 cm acceptable spiral CT scan reconstruction algorithm 0.5 cm ) . Baseline measurements/evaluations must complete within 4 week prior treatment . 5 . Adequate bone marrow , hepatic , renal function document within 14 day prior treatment document : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC , calculate absolute number neutrophil band ) ≥1.5 x 109 cells/L Platelets ≥100 x 109 cell /L AST ALT ≤2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , unless liver metastasis case AST ALT ≤5.0 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN calculate creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min Urinary protein &lt; 2+ urine dipstick . If dipstick ≥2+ 24hour urine collection do patient may enter urinary protein &lt; 2 g per 24 hour 6 . Age ≥18 year . 7 . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( see Appendix D ) 8 . No evidence preexist uncontrolled hypertension document 2 baseline blood pressure read take least 1 hour apart . The baseline systolic blood pressure reading must ≤140 , baseline diastolic blood pressure reading must ≤90 . Patients whose hypertension control antihypertensive therapy eligible . 9 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior treatment . 10 . Written voluntary inform consent . Exclusion Criteria Subjects one follow criterion ineligible study : 1 . Central lung lesion involve major blood vessel ( artery vein ) . ( Central lesion maintain structural integrity vessel potential bleed tumor lesion undergoes necrosis . MRI CT angiography use case question whether blood vessel involve . ) 2 . History hemoptysis 3 . Gastrointestinal abnormality include : inability take oral medication requirement intravenous alimentation prior surgical procedure affect absorption include gastric resection treatment active peptic ulcer disease past 6 month active gastrointestinal bleeding , unrelated cancer , evidence hematemesis , hematochezia melena past 3 month without evidence resolution document endoscopy colonoscopy . malabsorption syndrome . 4 . Previous treatment antiangiogenesis agent include thalidomide , inhibitor epidermoid growth factor ( EGF ) , platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) , fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) receptor . 5 . Current use anticipate inability avoid use drug know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ( ie , grapefruit juice , verapamil , ketoconazole , miconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin , clarithromycin , ergot derivative , indinavir , saquinavir , ritonavir , nelfinavir , lopinavir , delavirdine ) . 6 . Current use anticipate inability avoid use drug know CYP3A4 CYP1A2 inducer ( ie , carbamazepine , dexamethasone , felbamate , omeprazole , phenobarbital , phenytoin , primidone , rifabutin , rifampin , St. John 's wort ) . 7 . Active seizure disorder evidence brain metastasis . 8 . A serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair ability receive study treatment . 9 . History malignancy ( thyroid cancer ) except treat curative intent skin cancer ( melanoma ) situ breast cervical cancer treat curative intent cancer evidence disease 5 year 10 . Major surgical procedure radiation therapy within 4 week treatment . 11 . Dementia significantly alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent compliance requirement protocol . 12 .
