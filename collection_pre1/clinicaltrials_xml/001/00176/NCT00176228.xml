	<brief_summary>There two purpose project . Study 1 intend study safety efficacy Lamotrigine stabilize mood phase pediatric bipolar disorder ( Phases : mixed , manic , hypomanic , depressed episode ) 8-17 year old child . These child adolescent must treatment resistant ( failed two adequate trial mood stabilize medication ) qualify study . Study 2 aim examine brain activity and/or dysfunction lamotrigine treatment , look alteration lamotrigine treatment . Brain system associated attention emotional processing target .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Procedure Study 1 This study plan conduct 18 month , average recruitment 2 subject per month . Each subject involve study 18 26 week . While study medication dose 8 week treat full dose 6 week , withdrawal medication board prior study drug administration drug free period post washout require additional time line 12 week 14 week administer study drug . Conversely , range time necessary account factor child 's age , sex , weight , reaction medication side effect . Based factor , time take titrate medication dose optimal amount vary . Maintaining flexibility protocol part good clinical practice medication involve . Only child whose medication currently improve symptom recruit . Therefore child stabilize drug take . The initial 2 week screen period include diagnostic interview collection demographic information . Previous medication taper slowly 2-12-week period base tolerability need keep subject drug free state prior start study medication . It open trial subject aware type medication strength ( For example , one pill=25 mg strength ) pill . Research assessment mood symptom side effect carry 5 time course active trial period . Blood collect 3 time : subject washed-out ( baseline ) , optimal medication dose reach , finally end 6-week period full dose . The dose lamotrigine 12.5 mg per day begin first day . It increase 12.5 mg increment every week reach 50 mg 25 mg per week increment thereafter maximum dose 150 mg 50 kg 200-400 mg depend clinical response 50 kg . Increasing medication final dose take 8 week response full tolerable dose monitor response 6 week . Therefore , 18-26 week trial ( 2 12 weeks=screening wash ; 8 weeks=dosing ; 6 weeks=acute trial period full dose ) . Study 2 involves adolescent subject ( &gt; 10years age ) recruit Study 1 sample . This part study fMRI treatment study examine brain function receive lamotrigine medication bipolar disorder . The goal study 2 understand lamotrigine work brain . In order , view brain image fMRI scanner pre- post-treatment . This do subject begin take lamotrigine ( subject require `` wash-out '' period , describe study 1 , occur `` wash-out . '' ) The second scan take place medication trial ( 6-week active treatment period ) . While scanner , subject complete task relate think emotion . Subjects show picture face vary expression include happy , neutral angry ask identify emotion face , remember identify previously see face , determine age group various face ( i.e. , 30 year ) . Subjects also complete task involve process word express different emotion ( e.g. , happy , angry ) , respond different `` go '' `` no-go '' image flash screen . Brain activity record task . Each task take around 5 minute . Before actual fMRI scan , subject practice lie simulator , machine look sound like scanner .</detailed_description>

If discover interview parent and/or child understand consent/assent procedure , exclude . Girls pregnant plan become pregnant study period also exclude research . There concern raise literature need birth control practice male treat lamotrigine . As , provision exclude male research practice birth control . We expect small number child exclude study due exclusionary criterion . Selection subject base sex , race , ethnic group . For fMRI study : Given limited size magnet bore , individual body weight twohundred fifty pound unable test within MRI scanner . Women latter stage pregnancy may exclude due large body size potential discomfort MRI apparatus . Please note girl take part drug portion study ( include female subject except 5 healthy adult , control woman ) give 3 pregnancy drug study . This rule pregnancy since pregnant girl take study medication safety reason . Standard contraindication fMRI study include : cardiac pacemaker , aneurysm clip , cochlear implant , shrapnel , history metal fragment eye , claustrophobia Participants IQ le 70 ( assessed WRAT ) likely exclude due difficulty comprehend task procedure</criteria>
