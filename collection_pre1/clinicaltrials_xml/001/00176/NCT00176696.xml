	<detailed_description>After consent enter study , subject ask series question regard his/her medical history . He/she show test determine consciousness squeeze experimenter 's hand ask . It explain him/her unconscious , he/she able respond command squeeze hand . The facial monitor show patient , well location placement . Intraoperative Period : The lead place FACE monitor well BIS monitoring device . The objective BIS monitor already use University Hospital Operating room suit determine consciousness . An identical typical anesthetic protocol utilized patient order eliminate anesthetic factor . The protocol follow : After administration propofol induction , forearm tourniquet device inflate pressure great 200 mm Hg . A muscle relaxant give tourniquet inflated arm tourniquet paralyze . This allow check unconsciousness patient ; , patient tell , `` squeeze hand '' . It expect patient respond squeeze hand unconscious anesthetize . The maximum length time cuff inflate 20 minute . Tourniquets apply entire leg arm normally inflate 120 minute standard practice orthopedic surgery . One group patient , determine randomly , administer 250 ug fentanyl induction anesthesia , second group , also determine randomly , administer 50 ug fentanyl . Both group patient administer inhalational anesthetic ( isoflurane , desflurane , sevoflurane ) level 30 % insures unconsciousness ( call 1.1 MAC ) , give nitrous oxide 10 minute study period due gas ' effect Hagihira 's `` loss bicoherence '' phenomenon . The study period begin 5 minute surgical incision , end 5 minute surgical incision . Our hypothesis central registration pain exist despite presence adequate unconsciousness patient , FACE technology complement use BIS ( EEG ) monitor ensure effective administration anesthesia patient future .</detailed_description>
