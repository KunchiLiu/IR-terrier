	<brief_title>Irradiated Donor Lymphocytes Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma treat HLA-partially match relate donor lymphocyte . - Determine rate kinetics clinical/radiological response patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine rate graft-vs-host disease patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive irradiate donor lymphocytes IV 1 hour day 0 . Treatment repeat every 8-16 week 6 donor lymphocyte infusion absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood collect periodically research study , include immunophenotypic analysis cell assay cytotoxic T-lymphocytes natural killer-cell activity target cell . After completion study treatment , patient follow 60 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
