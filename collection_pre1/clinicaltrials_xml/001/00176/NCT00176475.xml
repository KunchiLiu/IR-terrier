	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : When irradiate lymphocyte donor infused patient may help patient 's immune system kill cancer cell . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving irradiated donor lymphocytes together rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study side effect well give irradiate donor lymphocytes together rituximab work treat patient relapsed refractory lymphoproliferative disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irradiated Donor Lymphocytes Rituximab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Lymphoproliferative Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine toxicity irradiate HLA-partially match relate donor lymphocyte administer rituximab patient relapse refractory CD20-positive lymphoproliferative disease . - Determine efficacy regimen patient . Secondary - Correlate response Fc receptor FcγIIIA polymorphism predict HLA-directed natural killer cell reactivity . OUTLINE : This pilot study . - Rituximab therapy : Patients receive rituximab IV day -1 , 6 , 13 , 20 . Treatment repeat approximately every 4 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Donor lymphocyte infusion : Patients receive irradiate donor lymphocytes IV 1 hour day 0 . Treatment repeat every 8-16 week ( alternate course rituximab therapy ) 6 donor lymphocyte infusion absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Peripheral blood collect periodically study correlative laboratory study . Blood sample analyze FcγIIIA polymorphism fluorescent situ hybridization reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction . Survival donor lymphocyte assess chimerism study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
