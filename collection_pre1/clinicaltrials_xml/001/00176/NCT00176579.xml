	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Measuring bone mineral density may help doctor predict whether prostate cancer come back . It may also help study prostate cancer future . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study whether bone mineral density affect cancer recurrence patient early stage prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Mineral Density Cancer Recurrence Patients With Early Stage Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine bone mineral density ( BMD ) patient clinically significant early stage prostate cancer . - Determine whether patient high level BMD radical prostatectomy cure less likely early relapse ( i.e. , less 3 year ) patient low level BMD . OUTLINE : This case-controlled study follow prospective , longitudinal , cohort study . Patients undergo bone mineral density ( BMD ) measurements dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry densitometer . Posteroanterior measurement total hip also record . Patients also undergo blood collection examine marker provide evidence systemic disease . Patients follow every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Biopsyconfirmed early stage prostate cancer Disease localize within capsule No evidence regional distant spread ( i.e. , T12 , N0 , M0 disease ) A cohort patient must undergo prior radical prostatectomy Prostate specific antigen &lt; 12 ng/mL Gleason score ≥ 6 PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Creatinine clearance ≤ 2.0 mg/dL No Paget 's disease No hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism No Cushing 's disease No chronic liver disease No major health problem would cause significant reduction mobility activity daily live PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics No prior bisphosphonates , thyroxin , calcitonin No prior agent suppress PSA level ( e.g. , finasteride ) No prior androgen estrogen therapy More 12 month since prior glucocorticoid More 12 month since prior herbal supplement know low PSA level</criteria>
