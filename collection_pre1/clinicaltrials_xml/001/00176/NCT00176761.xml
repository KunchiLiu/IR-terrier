	<brief_summary>This study conduct determine efficacy , side effect , toxicity investigational vaccine consist tumor-pulsed dendritic cell administer immune stimulate drug call interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . Dendritic cell immune cell obtain subject 's blood important body ’ immune response foreign substance . This study examine response subject 's immune system receive several vaccination contain dendritic cell expose dead fragment cancer cell laboratory . This may result sensitize subject 's dendritic cell cancer cell dendritic cell react cell immune system attack cancer . It show laboratory dendritic cell expose cancer cell fragment provide lymphocyte ( type white blood cell ) signal require order become fully activated acquire ability kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pretreatment screening : If subject decides participate study first present informed consent document read review Principal Investigator ( designee ) go aspect study answer question . Once patient consent , first screen make sure meet eligibility criterion . The screening process do make sure appropriate subject participate study . This process include review medical history , complete physical examination , standard blood test , EKG ( electrocardiogram ) , chest x-ray possible become pregnant , pregnancy test . These test normally perform patient prior receive chemotherapy cancer . In addition test normally perform , blood obtain test specific investigational study . These study specific test include blood test determine whether subject may infect hepatitis B virus AIDS virus , blood test determine ability immune system respond normal stimulation . A doctor also order CT scan nuclear medicine scan measure extent subject 's cancer study therapy possibility shrink tumor determine measure subject 's disease therapy . At time initial evaluation subject skin test determine ability mount immune response infectious agent ( tetanus , measles , mumps ) expose vaccinate . If subject fails demonstrate response skin test , allow participate study lack response indicate immune system may respond therapy plan study . Vaccine therapy : In order make vaccine subject 's tumor must surgical removal tumor order provide tumor cell . The doctor determine subject colorectal cancer cell easily obtainable . However , subject already available frozen tumor specimen University Michigan , may use vaccine preparation instead undergo another surgical procedure . This surgery may do solely purpose participate research may otherwise benefit subject . A separate consent form require surgery subject undergoes . The cancer cell obtain subject take laboratory separate single cell , disrupt make cell fragment , radiate kill cell mixed dendritic cell . The dendritic cell obtain peripheral blood . Subjects undergo procedure call leukapheresis involve place large needle ( central line ) vein arm . These central line insert local anesthesia ( subject remain awake…only site insertion “ frozen ” ) . Blood exit one needle process machine selectively remove one kind white blood cell return element blood back body . The leukapheresis procedure generally last three four hour . Following procedure , dendritic cell culture laboratory increase number dendritic cell . This procedure take 2 day . The tumor-exposed dendritic cell vaccine administer intradermal ( skin ) injection subject 's thigh arm day 1 , 15 29 study treatment . Additionally , receive IL-2 subcutaneous injection daily 4 day vaccination . Four week last vaccination , subject undergo skin test determine reactive tumor cell . White blood cell also obtain second leukapheresis procedure determine , via research test laboratory , circulate immune cell develop capacity respond cancer cell . This skin test leukapheresis research purpose . Also , 4 week subject receive last vaccination , x-rays and/or CT scan do determine whether disease respond immune therapy . If cancer worsen shrunk , offer option receive additional vaccination use tumor-pulsed dendritic cell provide experience severe toxicity first series vaccination provide enough vaccine material available . The additional vaccination would do use procedure schedule previous vaccination evidence subject 's disease start grow worsen . This include leukapheresis , vaccination , IL-2 administration . Re-treatments offer subject 's disease get bad tumor cell longer available produce vaccine . A subject 's study participation end leukopheresis tumor evaluation 4 week follow last series vaccination . Blood Drawing : The maximum amount blood , standard test research purpose draw 10 week total 100ccs , approximately 20 teaspoon , equivalent approximately 7 tablespoon 12 week time period . The length time subject would study minimum nine week . If physician determines subject benefiting study , may continue repeat vaccination long continue clinical benefit study vaccine available . During study , therapy alternative become clinically indicated , discussed subject . Also , significant new finding develop course research may affect subject 's willingness participate , tell .</detailed_description>
