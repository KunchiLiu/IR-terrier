	<brief_title>Ridaforolimus ( AP23573/MK-8669 ) Participants With Taxane-Resistant Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer ( AIPC ) ( MK-8669-017 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective phase II study assess anti-cancer activity weekly ridaforolimus administration participant taxane-resistant AIPC . Other objective include evaluate experimental parameter may predict indicate response mTOR inhibition , effect plasma VEGF , marker tumoral PI3K/mTOR-pathway activity , proteomic analysis . The inclusion evaluation trial may provide insight identification marker may helpful optimize ridaforolimus treatment identify patient ridaforolimus-sensitive tumor .</detailed_description>
