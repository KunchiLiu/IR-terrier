	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study carboplatin , paclitaxel , sorafenib tosylate see well work compare carboplatin paclitaxel treat patient stage III stage IV melanoma remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give carboplatin paclitaxel together sorafenib tosylate effective carboplatin paclitaxel treat melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Paclitaxel With Without Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival patient unresectable stage III stage IV melanoma treat carboplatin , paclitaxel placebo versus carboplatin , paclitaxel sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) . II . To compare progression-free survival , response rate , safety patient unresectable stage III stage IV melanoma treat carboplatin , paclitaxel placebo versus carboplatin , paclitaxel sorafenib . III . To analyze pharmacokinetic pharmacogenetic property sorafenib include angiogenesis , monooxygenases polymorphisms multidrug resistance ( MDR ) . IV . To assess association expression marker patient tumor clinical outcome . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Patients also receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) ( approximately every 12 hour ) day 2-19 . Arm II : Patients receive paclitaxel carboplatin Arm I . Patients also receive placebo PO BID ( approximately every 12 hour ) day 2-19 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease achieve partial response complete response may continue receive sorafenib tosylate placebo alone BID ( approximately every 12 hour ) day 1-21 . Courses sorafenib tosylate placebo repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
