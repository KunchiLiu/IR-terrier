	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect short cycle recombinant interleukin-2 ( also know rIL-2 aldesleukin ) give without anti-HIV drug HIV infect patient . The effect compare study group receive IL-2 antiretroviral therapy . Study hypothesis : Intermittent aldesleukin , give without antiretroviral therapy patient early HIV infection , produce change HIV viral load increase CD4+ T lymphocyte count comparable aldesleukin administer antiretrovirals .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Intermittent Aldesleukin Treatment With Without Anti-HIV Drugs HIV Infected People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) dramatically improve prognosis lower morbidity mortality rate HIV infect patient . However , significant drug toxicity , difficulty patient compliance HAART regimens , development drug resistance highlight need less toxic , immune-based strategy . Aldesleukin synthetic protein increase CD4 count ; currently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use patient metastatic melanoma renal cell carcinoma . Previous study aldesleukin HIV infect patient indicate increased CD4 count persist year aldesleukin administration , aldesleukin give HAART may also lead significant lowering viral load . This study examine immunologic effect intermittent cycle aldesleukin administer without HAART compare therapy HIV infect patient . This study last approximately 31 month . Participants randomly assign one three group study entry . Group A receive aldesleukin HAART . Group B receive aldesleukin skin twice daily 5 consecutive day every 8 week 3 cycle , need maintain CD4 count goal level . Group C receive aldesleukin skin twice daily 5 consecutive day every 8 week 3 cycle , need maintain CD4 count goal level ; Group C participant also take HAART 3 day prior start aldesleukin cycle , throughout 5-day aldesleukin cycle , 2 day end aldesleukin cycle ( maximum 10 day aldesleukin cycle ) . HAART provide study . Some Group B C participant may take part additional cycle aldesleukin meet certain study criterion . All participant study least 8 study visit ; visit occur study entry Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 32 . Blood collection occur visit include test CD4 count viral load . Groups B C additional blood collection within 4 day prior start aldesleukin cycle . On last day aldesleukin cycle , Groups B C assess toxicity , adverse event , adherence aldesleukin daily injection ; also another blood collection . Group C participants additional blood collection HIV genotyping complete third aldesleukin cycle . Extended follow-up visit occur approximately every 4 month additional two year . Blood collection occur visit include test CD4 count , viral load , laboratory test .</detailed_description>
