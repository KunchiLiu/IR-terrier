	<brief_title>Glucosamine Unum In Die Once A Day Efficacy ( GUIDE ) Trial : Glucosamine Sulfate Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis common degenerative joint disease , affect large proportion general population . Its severity progressive often require long-term treatment course . Medications osteoarthritis may affect symptom ( pain function limitation ) and/or modify joint structure . Pharmacological agent usually employ treat symptom generally include unspecific drug pure analgesic non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , well compound possibly disease specific , since probably interact osteoarthritis pathogenetic factor : glucosamine sulfate one agent . Glucosamine sulfate recently attract attention scientific community patient , two long-term ( 3 year ) clinical trial comparison placebo , show first agent able retard progression anatomic joint structure change knee osteoarthritis , besides control progression symptom . Earlier study show glucosamine sulfate effective relieving symptom osteoarthritis also shorter treatment course ( week month ) , comparison placebo . In addition , glucosamine sulfate efficacy short study least comparable unspecific symptomatic medication conventional NSAIDs , whilst well tolerate . However , practice guideline treatment osteoarthritis suggest acetaminophen ( paracetamol ) oral analgesic try first , successful , preferred long-term symptomatic medication . This trial therefore design confirm efficacy glucosamine sulfate comparison placebo ass relative value compare acetaminophen . In fact , superiority well tolerate drug glucosamine sulfate long-term treatment potential show trial , may represent major therapeutic advantage . The treatment duration 6 month , believe minimum length ass effect symptomatic medication osteoarthritis . The study perform accord multicenter , randomise , placebo- reference-controlled , double-blind ( double-dummy ) , parallel group , prospective design . The sample size calculate basis expect efficacy test drug primary outcome ( Lequesne index ) . Following screen visit short baseline period check adherence inclusion/exclusion criterion , total least 300 patient knee osteoarthritis randomise receive either oral glucosamine sulfate soluble powder 1500 mg once-a-day , acetaminophen tablet 1000 mg three time day ( total 3g/day , recommend Europe ) , placebo , 6 month . The rescue medication flare episodes consist standardize use ( accord specific instruction give patient ) ibuprofen 400 mg tablet , whose consumption record patient daily diary . The primary efficacy outcome measure represent change Lequesne algo-functional index ( assess clinic visit ) 6 month intention-to treat population , analyse General Linear Model ( GLM ) procedure ANOVA , Dunnet 's pairwise comparison versus placebo . Efficacy patient complete treatment accord protocol ( per-protocol completers ) also assess . Secondary efficacy outcome measure include change WOMAC index calculation proportion patient define responder treatment accord Osteoarthritis Research Society International ( OARSI ) criterion ( 2000 ) . The use rescue medication also assess . Safety assess report adverse event routine laboratory test . The glucosamine sulfate substance use trial ( crystalline glucosamine sulfate ) prescription drug Europe elsewhere , mostly used 1500 mg powder oral solution formulation administer daily . This substance/formulation effective safe vast majority glucosamine clinical trial , include long-term , 3-year study . Differently Europe country , glucosamine formulation market United States dietary supplement . They include glucosamine sulfate substance different original prescription preparation , glucosamine salt ( mainly glucosamine hydrochloride ) , administer accord different dosage scheme ( mainly oral solid formulation provide total 1500 mg dose , divide three daily intake , t.i.d. ) . In clinical trial conduct far , formulation fail show efficacy original glucosamine sulfate prescription preparation . The present study use therefore original prescription crystalline glucosamine sulfate give once-a-day ( unum-in-die , u.i.d . ) therefore name Glucosamine Unum In Die Efficacy ( GUIDE ) Trial .</detailed_description>
