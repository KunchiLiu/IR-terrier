	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn breast cancer tumor respond drug call Abraxane follow combination 3 chemotherapy drug commonly use breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapy With Abraxane 5-Fluorouracil , Epirubicin , Cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , non-randomized study neoadjuvant treatment nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel ( Abraxane ) every week 12 week follow 5-FU , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) every 3 week 4 cycle woman locally advance breast cancer . Patients HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer may receive trastuzumab concurrently chemotherapy discretion investigator . The primary aim study determine pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) sequential regimen . Patients achieve clinical complete response ( cCR ) , clinical partial response ( cPR ) , resectable stable disease ( SD ) undergo surgery . Surgery consist modify radical mastectomy excision primary tumor site clear surgical margin accompany axillary staging . Tumor sample take prior initiation treatment analyze molecular genetic change correlate tumor response . Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis breast cancer without document evidence distant metastatic disease . Patients clinical Stage IIB ( T3N0 ) , IIIA , IIIB breast cancer potential candidate trial .</detailed_description>

The following criterion evidence adequate hepatic function must meet : *Total bilirubin must less equal ULN lab unless patient grade 1 bilirubin elevation ( &gt; ULN 1.5 x ULN ) due Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome involve slow conjugation bilirubin ; *alkaline phosphatase must &lt; 2.5 x ULN lab ; *AST must less equal 1.5 x ULN lab . MUGA scan echocardiogram within 3 month prior entry : *age great equal 60 , *history hypertension , *plan receive trastuzumab . For patient MUGA scan echocardiogram perform reason , baseline LVEF must great equal LLN facility perform procedure must regional wall abnormality Clinical stage IIB disease cT2N1 . Definitive evidence metastatic disease ( M1 AJCC criterion ) Prior history invasive breast cancer either breast ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) ipsilateral breast treat radiation therapy ( patient history lobular carcinoma situ [ LCIS ] eligible ) . Any treatment currently diagnose breast cancer prior study entry include radiation therapy , chemotherapy , and/or hormonal therapy . Pregnancy lactation time study entry . Prior anthracycline taxanecontaining chemotherapy malignancy . Nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , diabetes , etc . ) would preclude patient receive study treatment would prevent require followup . Grade 2 great peripheral polyneuropathy time entry . Cardiac disease would preclude use anthracyclines trastuzumab . This include : *myocardial infarction document elevated cardiac enzyme persistent regional wall abnormality assessment LV function ; *angina pectoris require use antianginal medication ; *any history document congestive heart failure ; *serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication ; *severe conduction abnormality ; *valvular disease document cardiac function compromise ; *uncontrolled hypertension define blood pressure &gt; 160/100 mm/Hg . Any sex hormonal therapy , e.g. , birth control pill , ovarian hormonal replacement therapy , etc . ( These patient eligible therapy discontinue prior randomization . ) Women reproductive potential must agree use effective nonhormonal method contraception therapy . Therapy hormonal agent raloxifene , tamoxifen , selective estrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) , either osteoporosis breast cancer prevention . Patients eligible medication discontinue prior randomization . Use investigational agent within month enrollment study .</criteria>
