	<detailed_description>As see recombinant protein molecule , use injectable recombinant protein may result development neutralise antibody ( NAbs ) . Antibodies consider neutralising ability inhibit biological effect interferon bioassay system . EMD Serono actively pursue improvement formulation interferon ( IFN ) beta-1a reduce aggregate level develop formulation HSA-free . Reducing aggregate reduce antigenicity product removal HSA may unpredictable effect antigenicity . EMD Serono conduct study assess immunogenicity safety new HSA-free formulation , manufacture use IFN-ß-1a drug substance produce new clone FBS-free process .</detailed_description>
