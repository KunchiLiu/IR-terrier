	<brief_summary>Effective , suppressive treatment HIV infect patient major challenge HIV progressively destroy immune system . CD8 cell isolate patient 's blood grow large number laboratory may increase patient 's immune system response HIV . The purpose study determine CD8 cell provide effective antiviral activity HIV transplant back large number HIV infect patient . Study hypothesis : There specific cell immune system recognize kill HIV-infected cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The function CD8 cell human body kill infect target cell , HIV infect cell . Recent data suggest intravenous administration HIV-specific CD8 cell safe , augments host immunity , mediate dramatic reduction circulate HIV-infected CD4 cell . However , observed antiviral effect transient , HIV infect CD4 cell re-emerge number self CD8 cell decline . Augmenting CD8 cell response HIV immunotherapy CD8 cell may useful addition drug therapy infuse CD8 cell survive long-term vivo . Administration interleukin-2 ( also know aldesleukin IL-2 ) , naturally occur cytokine , propose way maintain number CD8 cell . This study evaluate safety efficacy immunotherapy HIV-specific CD8 cell HIV infect patient . Additionally , study determine aldesleukin injection improve persistence self CD8 transplant duration antiviral activity without severe toxicity . This study last 18 month . CD8 cell isolate blood HIV infect patient ; cell allow multiply laboratory , patient receive back CD8 cell . Patients receive 3 infusion self CD8 cell . On Day 0 , patient receive first infusion CD8 cell . On Day 7 , patient receive second infusion CD8 cell ; infusion follow 14 day aldesleukin administer daily injection skin . Patients less Grade 2 toxicity receive third infusion CD8 cell ; infusion follow 21 day aldesleukin .</detailed_description>
