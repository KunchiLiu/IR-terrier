	<brief_summary>This study determine stroke patient whether stimulation injured side brain combined stimulation weak hand temporarily improve motor function paralyze hand . It also examine whether stimulation healthy side brain combined stimulation weak hand temporarily improve motor function paralyze hand . Healthy adult volunteer adults stroke 3 month enter study may eligible participate . Candidates screen physical neurological examination . Stroke patient also magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , test use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image brain . Participants perform several task ( describe ) practice session five session separate day . They perform task undergo transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) plus electrical stimulation ( ES ) , procedure involve sham stimulation . For tDCS , small rubber electrode soak water tap subject 's head , one eye back head . The current pass two electrode . For ES , two pair electrode attach subject 's wrist paste . A short pulse current pass electrode , create electrical field stimulate brain . For sham stimulation , electrodes similarly place , stimulation . The task : - Jebsen-Taylor test : Subjects write , lift small common object like paper clip , perform activity like turn page , stack checker lift large object . They task fast possible . - Pinch force : Subjects press wedge instrument thumb index finger hard . There several trial every 10 second . - Speed tapping : Subjects press key keyboard quickly possible 10 second . - Simple reaction time task : Subjects perform quick wrist movement quickly possible response `` go '' signal present computer monitor . Muscle activity forearm record use electrode . - Motor sequence learning/Learning finger movement sequence : Subjects practice finger movement exercise keyboard press key correspond number display video screen . - Visual analog scale : Subjects complete three questionnaire attention , fatigue , mood . - Sensory monitoring : Subjects blindfold ask judge difference various sensation , feel plastic dome grating , vibration , plastic hair apply fingertip . - Scoring MRC scale : The muscle strength subject 's hand measure . - Fugl-Meyer scale : The subject 's ability move limbs measure . - Mini-mental state examination : The subject 's mental ability measure briefly . - Handedness questionnaire : The subject 's dominant hand determine . Participants also undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) electromyography ( EMG ) , activity . For TMS , wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The effect TMS muscle detect small electrode tap skin arm leg . EMG measure electrical activity muscle . For test , small electrode tap skin muscle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Motor Performance Chronic Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There universally accept strategy promote recovery motor function chronic stroke , main cause long-term disability among adult . It desirable develop strategy improve motor function stroke patient . Recently study stroke patient demonstrate transcranial direct current cortical stimulation ( tDCS ) association motor train lead improvement performance motor learning . Similarly , somatosensory stimulation ( peripheral nerve stimulation , PNS ) paretic hand stroke patient result improvement performance motor learning ( Celnik , unpublished data ) . Objective : The purpose protocol apply tDCS motor cortex affect hemisphere ( tDCS affect ) combination PNS paretic hand patient chronic stroke , test hypothesis combine tDCS affected PNS lead prominent improvement motor performance functional relevant task paretic hand relative either intervention alone . Furthermore , recent study demonstrate unaffected hemisphere exerts abnormally high inhibitory influence affect hemisphere . This abnormality might adversely influence motor recovery . Therefore purpose study apply tDCS unaffected hemisphere ( tDCS unaffected ) test hypothesis regulation activity intact hemisphere , combination PNS affect hemisphere , elicit prominent improvement functional relevant task either intervention alone . Study population : We plan study patient chronic stroke healthy age , gender hand dominance match volunteer . Design : To test hypothesis subject participate 13 session double blind design . The order patient control receive intervention randomize . Outcome measure : Primary outcome measure total time complete functional relevant task hand , Jebsen-Tailor-Test ( JTT ) . Secondary outcome tap speed one finger ; simple reaction time ( SRT ) ; pinch force ; number correct keyboard piano sequence play 30sec paretic hand . To good understand mechanism underlie propose behavioral gain , use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) identify corticomotor excitability change .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We include patient thromboembolic nonhemorrhagic hemispheric lesion least 6 month stroke . We choose patient initially severe motor paresis ( MRC grade 2 ) , subsequently recover point residual motor deficit perform require task . Assessment initial functional state take either patient report medical record . As control group , include age gender match healthy volunteer match nondominant/dominant hand ( affected hand stroke patient ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients one stroke medial cerebral artery territory . Patients bilateral motor impairment . Patients cerebellar brainstem lesion . Patients healthy volunteer unable perform task ( wrist elbow flexion least MRC grade 2 ) . Patients healthy volunteer history severe alcohol drug abuse , psychiatric illness like severe depression , poor motivational capacity , severe language disturbance , particularly receptive nature serious cognitive deficit ( define equivalent minimental state exam score 23 less ) . Patients healthy volunteer severe uncontrolled medical problem ( e.g . cardiovascular disease , severe rheumatoid arthritis , active joint deformity arthritic origin , active cancer renal disease , kind endstage pulmonary cardiovascular disease , deteriorate condition due age , uncontrolled epilepsy others ) . Patients healthy volunteer increase intracranial pressure evaluate clinical mean . Patients unstable cardiac arrhythmia . Patients healthy volunteer h/o hyperthyroidism individual receive drug act primarily central nervous system . Patients healthy volunteer moderate severe microangiopathy , polyneuropathy , diabetes mellitus , ischemic peripheral disease . Patients healthy volunteer diseased damage skin face scalp . Patients healthy volunteer professionally practice play keyboard musical instrument train typist . Pregnancy</criteria>
