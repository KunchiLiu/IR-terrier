	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study docetaxel , prednisone , bevacizumab see well work compare docetaxel prednisone treat patient prostate cancer respond hormone therapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel prednisone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether docetaxel , prednisone , bevacizumab effective docetaxel prednisone treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Prednisone With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition bevacizumab docetaxel prednisone increase overall survival compare docetaxel prednisone alone patient HRPC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival two regimen patient HRPC . II . To compare two regimen proportion patient experience 50 % post-therapy PSA decline baseline . III . To compare two regimen respect proportion patient experience grade 3 high toxicity . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord predict 24-month survival probability ( &lt; 10 % vs 10-29.9 % v ≥ 30 % ) , age ( &lt; 65 year vs ≥ 65 year ) , prior history arterial event ( i.e. , cardiac ischemia/infarction , CNS cerebrovascular ischemia , peripheral arterial ischemia , CNS hemorrhage ) ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour placebo IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Patients also receive oral prednisone daily day 1-21 . ARM II : Patients receive docetaxel prednisone arm I . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
