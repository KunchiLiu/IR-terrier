	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test new treatment prostate cancer . We explore use cytokine ( immune stimulating ) gene therapy directly inject virus produce cytokine call interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) prostate gland control tumor growth . We propose explore use adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12 ( Ad.hIL-12 ) patient recurrent non-metastatic prostate cancer follow radiation therapy Phase I trial . Participants place rise dose group primary endpoint learn maximum dose safely give injection directly prostate gland . Toxicity determine physical examination , laboratory value , blood level cytokine . Evidence immune response prostate protein also monitor . If treatment work , cancer shrink grow . This monitored prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level blood . However , know treatment effective . If PSA continue rise treatment , participant take study offer treatment . There compensation participation research study . There charge treatment gene therapy monitoring associate research study . Monitoring occur specially designate clinical research center .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients radiorecurrent prostate cancer viable treatment option , term efficacy morbidity . Local therapy fail even highly select patient due locally advanced disease , microscopic metastasis , worsen biology cancer cell . Furthermore , attempt salvage local treatment complication incontinence , impotence case unremitting penile pain . Pre-clinical study mouse model prostate cancer note potential benefit adenovirus-mediated gene therapy deliver IL-12 clinical scenario . This treatment able significantly growth suppress inject tumor prolong survival reduce number pre-established metastasis . The mechanisms underlying activity involve innate immunity ( neutrophils natural killer [ NK ] cell ) acquire immunity ( T cell ) enhance expression Fas sensitize Fas/Fas ligand ( FasL ) kill . This Phase I study . Therefore , primary objective find Maximum Tolerated Dose . Within realm monitor pro-inflammatory cytokine . Secondary aspect involve correlate important mechanism identify pre-clinical model : induction T cell .</detailed_description>
