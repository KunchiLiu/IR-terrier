	<detailed_description>Allergic rhinitis nasal inflammatory disorder initiate immunoglobulin-E ( IgE ) mediate hypersensitivity allergen . This condition characterize sneezing , rhinorrhea , nasal itch congestion . When patient expose allergen sensitive , allergen cross-link Ig E antibody , bound surface tissue mast cell . This cross-linking trigger release proinflammatory substance , histamine eicosanoids , know early response . In skin prick test , reaction produce wheal-and-flare response . Normally , systemic exposure allergen also lead prolong late reaction , eosinophil , basophil , activate T cell recruit site exposure . The recruited T cell also secrete inflammatory cytokine , interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) IL-5 , typically associate helper T cell type 2 ( TH2 ) , propagate inflammatory cascade . Typically , early response occur within 15 30 minute ( quickly second ) usually resolve within 1 3 hour , late response occur within 6 12 hour resolve 24 hour . Allergic vaccination ( AV ) , also refer immunotherapy allergen-specific immunotherapy ( SIT ) , curative approach available allergic disease , directly treat underlying disease . AV practice administer gradually increase quantity allergen extract allergic patient ameliorate symptom associate subsequent exposure causative allergen . AV believe exert beneficial effect immune system , least part , modify T-lymphocyte response subsequent natural allergen exposure . AV show inhibit early late response allergen exposure . AV act T cell modify peripheral mucosal TH2 responses allergen favor helper T cell type 1 ( TH1 ) responses . One hallmarks successful AV redress `` healthy '' TH1/TH2-balance . Although efficacious , immunotherapy generally consider long-term disease modifying measure require month year treatment , entail multiple injection regimens involve risk adverse immune reaction . Recent improvement , optimal dosing , allergen modification ( reduce allergenicity maintain immunogenicity ) , adjuvant adsorption ( control release ) adjuvant activity ( assist immunomodulatory action ) explore reduce risk anaphylaxis decrease commitment multiple injection . A novel allergy vaccine ( Ragweed MATAMPL ) develop prevention relief allergic symptom cause variety pollen . Ragweed MATAMPL , contain allergen ragweed ( chemically modify glutaraldehyde ) adsorb onto L-tyrosine addition adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A ( MPL ) , evaluate specific treatment ragweed seasonally induce allergic rhinitis . Ragweed MATAMPL intend use pre-seasonal therapeutic allergy vaccine patient proven seasonal allergic rhinitis conjunctivitis due IgE mediate allergy ragweed . This novel vaccine formulation design provide vaccine efficacious four escalate dose injection , contrast longer schedule currently use . This placebo-controlled clinical trial design evaluate safety efficacy Ragweed MATAMPL determine patient symptomatic response pollen patient quality life environmental exposure chamber ( EEC ) reproduce clinical setting . The development EEC , delivers control pollen challenge time allow evaluation patient 's response time point throughout challenge process , provide opportunity examine various aspect efficacy anti-allergic treatment within single center various time year . The EEC affords control environment natural pollen exposure variables unpredictable pollen level , vary weather condition study period , vary level pollen exposure within patient population eliminate . Furthermore , question patient compliance largely eliminate patient scrutinize closely record symptom . In addition , EEC study acceptable study model determine dose response allergic rhinitis drug outline draft U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) guideline `` Allergic Rhinitis Clinical Development Programs Drug Products , '' April 2000 .</detailed_description>
