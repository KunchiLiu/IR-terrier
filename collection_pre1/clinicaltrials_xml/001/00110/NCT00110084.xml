	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , ABI-007 ( Nab-Paclitaxel ( ( Nanoparticle Albumin Bound ) -Paclitaxel ) ) gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give ABI-007 together gemcitabine work treat woman metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ABI-007 ( Nab-Paclitaxel ) Gemcitabine Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity ABI-007 gemcitabine , term response rate woman metastatic breast cancer . - Determine toxicity profile regimen , term incidence severity observe toxic effect , patient . Secondary * Determine time disease progression survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive ABI-007 IV 30 minute gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 43 patient accrue study within 20 month .</detailed_description>
