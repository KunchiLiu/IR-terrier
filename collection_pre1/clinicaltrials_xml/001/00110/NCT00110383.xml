	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Pediatric asthma well-documented public health issue United States . The impact pediatric asthma measure health care cost morbidity . Whereas many factor contribute high health care cost asthma , much morbidity directly attribute lack adherence medical treatment . The consequence non-adherence individual ashtma exacerbation . Greater number exacerbation lead increased school absenteeism , great activity limitation , decrease quality life parent child , increase urgent health care use cost , increase parental day miss work . Therefore , adherence treatment essential proper asthma management ultimate reduction morbidity . Asthma morbidity , measure number exacerbation , largely preventable patient education optimal treatment . However , demonstrate patient education alone insufficient decrease asthma morbidity . Optimal treatment essential control asthma morbidity . Inhaled corticosteroid offer considerable protection asthma exacerbation . However , minority asthma patient take inhaled steroid recommend National Asthma Education Prevention Program ( NAEPP ) guideline . Therefore , Pediatric Asthma Guidelines recommend development test program ( include school-based program ) increase adherence therapy . Because morbidity high inner-city , low-income , minority child , study collaborate several inner-city , low-income , minority school district examine effect school-based supervised asthma therapy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study longitudinal two-group trial effectiveness school-based supervised asthma therapy program . Two hundred fifty child randomly assign one two group : school-based supervised asthma therapy parental supervise asthma therapy . The child follow 16 month .</detailed_description>
