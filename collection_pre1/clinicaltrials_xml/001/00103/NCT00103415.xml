	<brief_summary>During one year , 5-8 % population suffer major depression . Some key symptom loss interest daily activity , loss energy sleep disturbance . The financial consequence disease estimate 30 million pound per year Great Britain USA alone . There increase interest effect exercise depression . Smaller study indicate exercise good treatment depression . This study large scale randomize trial hopefully bring important knowledge effect exercise depression . We compare effect endurance training , weight-lifting exercise control group depressive symptom 4 month training , twice week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Investigating Effect Different Exercise Forms Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The incidence depression estimate 3-5 % , lifetime prevalence 17 % western society . The incidence patient population affect chronic disable physical illness high 20 % . Depressive symptom prolong feel sadness , low self esteem even suicidal tendency consequence patient ’ social life , also show correlation severity depression number work day lost.Depression associate increase risk condition osteoporoses , cardiovascular disease dementia . The global burden disease report WHO others state unipolar depressive disorder fourth lead cause disease burden term lose year healthy life , major depression account 12 % total year live disability 2000 . The economic burden depression national economy US 2000 estimate 83,1 billion dollar ( 31 % direct medical cost , 7 % suicide-related mortality cost 62 % workplace cost ) . In 2001 meta-analysis randomize control trial compare exercise establish treatment patient diagnosed depression conclude : ” The effectiveness exercise reduce symptom depression determine lack good quality research clinical population adequate follow ” . The author find majority study blind outcome assessment , base intent-to-treat principle short follow-up . In conclusion summary late review subject , state likely exercise effect patient diagnose depression , many conduct study significant methodological problem , might substantial effect trial results.Despite criticism publish trial suggest exercise positive effect patient diagnose depression . A RCT ( n=156 , age &gt; 50 , Hamilton rating scale depression ( HAMD ) -17mean= 18,5 ) 1999 compare aerobic exercise program , standard medical treatment ( SSRI ) group receive . No significant difference observe group 16 week intervention . A study 2004 show effect aerobic exercise depression light moderately depressed patient ( n=82 ) receive medication . The study compare exercise program 17,5 kcal/kg/week ( jog one mile approximately equal 100 kcal ) exercise program 7,5 kcal/kg/week control group . After 12 week intervention group receive strenuous ( 17,5 kcal/kg/week ) program show significant reduction symptom compare group aerobic exercise similar 7,5 kcal/kg/week control group . No significant difference observe low energy expenditure program control group . A recently publish study elderly progressive resistance training support finding intensity relate effect exercise depression.The effect exercise endorphin , monoamine level neutrophin propose biological mediator exercise depression , well psychosocial mechanism increase physical self-worth distraction . Only one previous study compare aerobic non-aerobic exercise form , theoretically could work different biological mechanism , enhance serotonergic activity due enhance free tryptophan level aerobic exercise . This study give u opportunity compare aerobic non-aerobic exercise comparable population . Studies like rarely include measure biological parameter . Disturbances hypothalamic-pituitary axis high cortisol level lack ability suppress endogen cortisol response dexamethasone long know accompany depression . Increased fitness experimental model show decrease cortisol response psychological physical stress . Furthermore , serum prolactin use indicator central serotonergic activity show abnormal response physical activity depress patient . New evidence biological effect exercise include increase BDNF , think mediate positive effect exercise cognition response physical activity rodent . The deficit cognitive function depress patient widely recognize , cognition previously show relate fitness level older adult long term physical intervention . The effect long term physical intervention cognitive skill , knowledge never examine clinically depressed patient . On background argue randomize study base intent-to-treat principle , include clinical population long follow-up need evaluate efficacy exercise patient diagnose light moderate depression , regard depressive symptom lose day work .</detailed_description>
