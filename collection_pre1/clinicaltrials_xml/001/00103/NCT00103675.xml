	<detailed_description>Acupuncture ancient Chinese practice involve use specialized needle stimulate part body . The number Americans use acupuncture service continue grow year . Two element require deliver high-quality acupuncture treatment identification appropriate acupuncture point proper manipulation acupuncture needle . Despite grow awareness importance proper needle technique , tool capable objectively measure needle manipulation clinical setting ever develop . Such tool would applications acupuncture research , teaching , clinical practice . This study develop test simple hand-held sensor capable make objective needle torque measurement . There two part study . In Part 1 , researcher develop hand-held sensor ( call AcuSensor ) mount handle acupuncture needle measure torque manual needle manipulation . In Part 2 , sensor test accuracy reliability three different group . Group 1 consist patient unilateral musculoskeletal back pain . Group 1 participant undergo one session acupuncture treatment torque measurement needle manipulation technique examine . In Group 2 , practitioner student two leading acupuncture school use AcuSensor teach clinic . Teachers student complete questionnaire evaluate sensor 's usefulness . Experienced acupuncturists comprise Group 3 ; receive AcuSensor training evaluate performance AcuSensor clinical practice . Information range variability torque measurement produce different practitioner technique obtain use sensor . Group 3 acupuncturists also guess needle torque training sensor turn order determine way AcuSensor training affect acupuncturists ' sensory perception needle grasp .</detailed_description>
