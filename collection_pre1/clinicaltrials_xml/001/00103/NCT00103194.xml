	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well lapatinib ditosylate work treat patient rise prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , protein make prostate gland , indicate prostate cancer come back previous treatment . Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth may delay prevent progression prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ditosylate Treating Patients With Rising PSA Indicating Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate percentage patient hormone sensitive prostate cancer experience &gt; 50 % decline serum PSA treatment GW572016 ( lapatinib ditosylate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate duration PSA decline . II . To characterize change PSA slope GW572016 . III . To characterize safety tolerability GW572016 patient population . IV . To estimate time progression ( TTP ) progression-free survival 2 year ( start therapy ) . V. To evaluate correlation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression/signaling ( available prostate biopsy specimens prostatectomy block ) relationship change PSA patient treat GW572016 . OUTLINE : Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month patient &lt; 2 year study entry , every 6 month patient 2-5 year study entry , every year patient 5-10 year study entry 10 year .</detailed_description>
