	<brief_summary>This Phase I/II study evaluate safety immunogenicity LC16m8 , modify vaccinia vaccine . After consent thorough screening ( include safety lab , EKG , medical history ) , healthy , previously unvaccinated volunteer age 18-34 receive single vaccination either LC16m8 current US-licensed smallpox vaccine , Dryvax . Volunteers blindly randomize treatment group 4:1 ratio ( 4 LC16m8 1 Dryvax recipient ) . Follow-up clinical evaluation , laboratory testing , EKGs cardiac assessment do regularly schedule follow-up visit 1 year vaccination .</brief_summary>

Adequate renal function define serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL ; urine protein &lt; 100 mg/dL , trace negative proteinuria UA , estimate creatinine clearance &gt; 55 mL/min . Renal function measure ensure subject could meet criterion use Vistide , need . Hematocrit , hemoglobin , platelet , white blood cell count ( WBC ) within normal limit male female . EKG EEG ( test ) baseline reading within normal limit ( read central site ) . Willing refrain donate blood ( studyrelated ) throughout study period least 21 day ( scab separation ) vaccination . In case , state law restrictive . Negative serum pregnancy test female screen within 2 day prior vaccination . If volunteer female childbearing potential , must agree use effective birth control methods become pregnant course study . A female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal surgically sterilize . Effective birth control method include license , approve hormonal method pill , patch , injection , implant .
