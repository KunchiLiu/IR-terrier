	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make gene-modified virus person 's white blood cell may make body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Biological therapy , Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Combining different type biological therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study give vaccine therapy together dendritic cell see well work compare give vaccine therapy together GM-CSF treat patient liver lung metastasis colorectal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare 2-year disease-free survival patient completely resect hepatic pulmonary metastasis secondary colorectal cancer treat adjuvant vaccine therapy comprise vaccinia-Carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) -mucin 1 ( MUC-1 ) - Triad costimulatory molecule TRICOM vaccine ( PANVAC-V ) fowlpox-CEA-MUC-1-TRICOM vaccine ( PANVAC-F ) administer autologous dendritic cell sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) . Secondary - Compare rate magnitude immune response , determine enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot ( ELISpot ) , patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo leukapheresis obtain leukocyte generation autologous dendritic cell ( DC ) . Patients receive autologous DC load vaccinia-CEA-MUC-1-TRICOM ( PANVAC-V ) vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) intradermally ( ID ) day 1 autologous DC load fowlpox-CEA-MUC-1-TRICOM ( PANVAC-F ) vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) intradermally ( ID ) day 28 , 56 , 84 . - Arm II : Patients receive PANVAC-V SC day 1 PANVAC-F SC day 28 , 56 , 84 . Patients also receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) SC injection site daily day 0-3 , 28-31 , 56-59 , 84-87 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 72 patient ( 36 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
