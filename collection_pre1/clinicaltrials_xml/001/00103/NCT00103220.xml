	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity , pharmacokinetic profile recommend phase 2 dose SJG-136 patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine preliminary efficacy data evaluation correlative marker DNA damage apoptosis peripheral blood lymphocyte . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation study . Patients receive SJG-136 intravenously ( IV ) 20 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos SJG-136 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . At least 6 patient treated MTD .</detailed_description>
