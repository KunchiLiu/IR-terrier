	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Drugs , goserelin , leuprolide , flutamide , bicalutamide , may stop adrenal gland make androgen . Giving bortezomib hormone therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bortezomib without hormone therapy work treat patient relapsed prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib With Without Hormone Therapy Treating Patients With Relapsed Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) relapse observe rise testosterone combination treatment hormone blockade bortezomib . Secondary - Determine safety drug combination combine androgen blockade therapy patient . - Determine disease-free interval patient treat regimen . - Determine time tsetosterone rise patient treat wtih regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive androgen blockade therapy comprise 3-month subcutaneous injection goserelin OR leuprolide OR FDA-approved method primary androgen suppression AND oral flutamide bicalutamide daily 3 month . Patients also receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment bortezomib repeat every 28 day 3 course . Patients achieve CR discontinue treatment observe PSA metastatic disease recurrence . Patients PR stable disease receive additional combine androgen blockade therapy 3 additional course bortezomib . Patients progressive disease remove study . Patients follow every 3 month 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-42 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
