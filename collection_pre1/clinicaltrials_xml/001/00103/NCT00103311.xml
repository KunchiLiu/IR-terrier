	<brief_title>SB-715992 Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate patient advance metastatic colorectal cancer treat SB-715992 week 3 week , every 28 day SB-715992 every 21 day . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time tumor progression , progression free overall survival patient toxicity patient advance metastatic colorectal cancer treat SB-715992 week 3 week , every 28 day SB-715992 every 21 day . II . To characterize population pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter SB-715992 include assessment significant covariates SB-715992 PK assessment potential relationship pharmacokinetics SB-715992 relevant safety efficacy endpoint . IV . To examine cytoskeletal morphology change response SB-715992 peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumor fluorescent immunohistochemistry . V. To evaluate mRNA expression betaΙΙΙ-tubulin KSP archival tumor tissue . VI . To determine frequency genomic polymorphism gene target SB-715992 ( measure peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) assess whether germline polymorphism ( DNA ) gene target SB-715992 ( KSP inhibitor ) associate toxicity clinical outcome patient colorectal cancer . Further , whether gene involve metabolism ( CYP3A4 ) resistance ( MDR1 ) affect outcome patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive SB-715992 IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive SB-715992 IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
