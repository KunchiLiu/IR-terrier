	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study bortezomib irinotecan see well work compare bortezomib alone treat patient locally recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bortezomib together irinotecan may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether give bortezomib together irinotecan effective bortezomib alone treat head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib With Without Irinotecan Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate activity combination PS-341 ( bortezomib ) irinotecan patient locally advance , recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) response rate single agent PS-341 ( follow irinotecan time progression ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To continue explore toxicity PS-341 alone combination PS-341 irinotecan patient population . II . To evaluate time progression , overall survival response irinotecan PS-341 give PS-341 alone . III . To evaluate relationship pre-treatment nuclear localization NF-kB , NF-kB regulate gene expression tissue ( Cyclin D1 , IAP1 , Bcl-XL , Topo I ) , serum ( IL-6 , IL-8 , GRO-1 VEGF ) response . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II : Patients receive bortezomib arm I . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Upon disease progression , patient may cross arm I . Patients follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
