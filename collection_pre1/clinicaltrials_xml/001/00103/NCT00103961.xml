	<brief_summary>This long-term follow-up study people identify acute recent HIV infection follow clinical research site associate Acute HIV Infection Early Disease Research Program ( AIEDRP ) . The purpose study collect data immunological virologic response occur early course HIV infection treatment-naive treatment-experienced HIV infect adult . Study hypothesis : This study examine immunological response occur early course HIV infection treat untreated individual . The long-term follow-up subject help identify host immunological genetic factor along therapeutic strategy associate control viremia delay disease progression . In addition , cohort provide recruit mechanism support future trial therapy restore immune function . Furthermore , cohort provide population suitable monitoring change pattern transmission drug resistant viral strain also evaluate ongoing behavioral risk factor associate HIV transmission .</brief_summary>
