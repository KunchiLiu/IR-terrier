	<brief_title>A Novel Method Determine HIV Incidence Among Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV infection incidence estimate important , determine specific population community HIV education session benefit change infection pattern occur , also target population therapeutic intervention measure effect community . It estimate half new HIV infection United States occur person age 25 year , translate approximately 20,000 new HIV-infected young people annually . Incidence estimate test cohort individual antibody two different time period observe number new infection , demonstrate presence HIV p24 viral RNA antibody-negative person . Since strategy logistically difficult , expensive , and/or require significant laboratory infrastructure , new laboratory-based strategy devise classify individual recently infect established infection . These serologic assay know `` sensitive/less sensitive ( S/LS ) assay '' . They base either concept antibody titer concept antibody avidity . There several S/LS test available perform serum collect via venipuncture . Based several study show obtain saliva desirable method collection adolescent receive HIV testing , anticipate collection saliva use determine HIV incidence S/LS method among adolescent would valuable adjunct population study increase compliance test enrollment . The aim study prove equivalence serum S/LS reference method ( CDC validate serum S/LS Dilutional Vironostika ( DV ) Organon Teknika ) experimental method us FDA approve saliva collection device ( OraSure Technologies ) . Our rationale follow syllogism , i.e. , serum S/LS EIA ( DV ) best serologic method determine incidence estimate saliva S/LS method find perform equivalently , follow saliva S/LS method use effectively determine incidence . Therefore , purpose show equivalence two assay . To address issue accuracy , study plan assess saliva S/LS test seroconversion panel exact time acquisition HIV infection know . This cross-sectional , laboratory-based study design develop evaluate saliva-based S/LS assay differentiating individual recent HIV infection ( le 133 day ) establish HIV infection . A total 440 subject recruit study . A serum two saliva sample obtain every subject . The first 40 patient sample use develop calibrate saliva-based S/LS method . The remain patient sample test use calibrate saliva base S/LS assay reference serum S/LS assay concordance two method analyze .</detailed_description>
