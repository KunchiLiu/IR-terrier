	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use contrast imaging agent ferumoxytol ( ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite ) improve view tumor patient high-grade brain tumor cancer spread brain . Diagnostic procedure , MRI , may help find diagnose brain tumor find far disease spread . The contrast imaging agent ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite consist small iron particle take blood stream brain area tumor . It may help visualize blood flow go tumor well standard substance gadolinium-based contrast agent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Investigate utility ferumoxytol gadolinium-based contrast agent ( GBCA ) improve image biomarkers malignant brain tumor single image session compare dynamic susceptibility contrast ( DSC ) determine relative cerebral blood volume ( rCBV ) dynamic contrast enhancement ( DCE ) determine vascular permeability ( derive transfer coefficient [ Ktrans ] ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare evaluate magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) ferumoxytol different time point . II . Assess number size tumor image . III . Assess tumor vascularity . IV . Assess histology electron microscopy ( EM ) tissue sample . V. Assess difference subject prior therapy versus ( vs. ) prior therapy ( radiation and/or chemotherapy ) . VI . Assess long term image characteristic different tumor use DSC DCE . OUTLINE : Patients receive ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite intravenously ( IV ) begin approximately 15 second start 3T DSC-MRI GBCA IV approximately 1 minute 50 second start 3T DCE-MRI day 1 . Patients also undergo MRI without contrast baseline day 2 . Imaging ferumoxytol , GBCA , without contrast repeat every 3 week total 6 imaging session 5 year . After completion study , patient follow approximately 4-6 week .</detailed_description>
