	<brief_title>Cilengitide Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy , measure rate clinical progression six-months , two dose level EMD121974 patient asymptomatic metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety two dose level EMD121974 patient metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer . II . To assess objective response rate two dose level EMD121974 patient metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer bidimensionally measurable disease . III . To assess rate 50 % great decline level Prostate Specific Antigen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect integrin αvβ3 αvβ5 inhibition total circulate tumor cell endothelial cell isolated peripheral blood bone marrow aspirate patient metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer . II . To study genotypic/phenotypic variance circulate tumor cell patient metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer EMD121974 treatment . III . To develop genetic profile cDNA microarray analysis circulate tumor cell isolated patient metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer integrin αvβ3 αvβ5 inhibition . IV . Determine effect integrin αvβ3 αvβ5 inhibition systemic bone remodel marker patient metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior bisphosphonate use ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 dos cilengitide . ARM I : Patients receive low dose cilengitide IV 1 hour twice week 6 week . AMR II : Patients receive high dose cilengitide IV 1 hour twice week 6 week . In arm , treatment repeat every 6 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 2 course , patient undergo response assessment . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive least 3 additional course beyond documentation CR . Patients partial response stable disease continue treatment indefinitely absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients mixed response may continue treatment discretion investigator . Patients follow survival .</detailed_description>
