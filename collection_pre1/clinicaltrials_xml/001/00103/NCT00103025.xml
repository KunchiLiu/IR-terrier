	<brief_summary>This study determine dose sodium nitrite safely used prevent constriction , tighten , artery . Narrowed arteries brain cause stroke . Animal study show nitrite injection improve blood flow injection long period time prevent damage artery brain ; however , information effect prolong nitrite infusion human . This study establish safe dose side effect nitrite infusion human . Healthy normal volunteer 21 60 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen high low blood pressure , aspirin use , pregnancy , blood level nitrite methemoglobin ( substance temporarily slightly lower oxygen carry red blood cell ) . Pregnant woman exclude study . Participants admit Clinical Center 16 1/4 day , first 2 day hospital 's intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Upon admission provide medical history , physical cardiovascular examination , blood test . For infusion procedure , catheter ( thin plastic tube ) insert artery wrist crease elbow measure blood pressure , catheter place vein arm administer nitrite withdraw blood sample . In morning day 1 , initial blood pressure heart rate measurement take blood sample drawn , saline ( salt water ) infusion start . Blood pressure heart rate monitor every 30 minute 6 hour , every hour 6 hour , every 2 hour 12 hour . Blood sample collect every 4 hour 24 hour . On day 2 , sodium nitrite infusion begin . Blood pressure methemoglobin monitor every 10 minute first 2 hour . If blood pressure remain stable , frequency measurement decrease every 30 minute 4 hour , every 1 hour next 6 hour , every 4 hour 12 hour . If pressure continue remain stable , monitor continue every 8 hour rest study . Blood drawn periodically catheter determine amount nitrite methemoglobin body , decrease frequency several time first hour infusion every 24 hour . After first 24 48 hour nitrite infusion , participant transfer ICU general nursing unit fo ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide ( NO ) beneficial treatment many animal model disease like heart brain ischemia , reperfusion injury , delayed cerebral vasospasm subarachnoid hemorrhage . It also show open blood-brain barrier facilitate transfer chemotherapeutic agent , dilate constrict pulmonary artery , inhibit apoptosis , well modulate angiogenesis . Until recently , biological effect attribute regional synthesis nitric oxide endothelium local influence vascular tone . However , `` NO bioactivity '' may transport blood biological effect distance site entry circulation . These effect NO mediate intravascular NO-stores . Candidates protein heme-bound NO specie ( RXNO ) plasma erythrocytes oxidative NO-metabolite nitrite . Cumulating evidence suggest nitrite may serve major intravascular storage pool NO . Recent study show ( 1 ) regional , intra-arterial infusion nitrite elicits downstream vasodilator response human ( 2 ) intravenous long-lasting administration prevents development delay cerebral vasospasm primate model subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) . These study suggest potential new therapeutic approach many disease . Despite extensive data document pharmacokinetics safety bolus short intravascular infusion nitrite , human data evaluate safety toxicity prolong delivery nitrite , would require treatment vascular disease . OBJECTIVES This study follow objective : ( 1 ) determine safety ( 2 ) toxicity 48-hour 14-day intravenous infusion nitrite . The study also help elucidate mechanism ( ) nitrite ion contribute vasodilation . STUDY POPULATION The study population include sixteen 48-hour infusion healthy volunteer ( 40 screen volunteer ) gender , age 21-60 , continuous intravenous infusion sodium nitrite ( source drug determine CRADA ) . DESIGN This Phase I toxicity study intermediate ( 48-hour ) intravenous infusion sodium nitrite healthy volunteer . OUTCOME MEASURES Sixteen healthy volunteer gender , age 21-60 , 48-hour continuous intravenous infusion sodium nitrite subject ' clinical condition , blood level nitrite/methemoglobin , hematology , blood chemistry , pressure meticulously monitor . The first subject receive sodium nitrite infusion 12 mg/48 hour . This dose , accord knowledge former study detail analysis pharmacokinetics sodium nitrite , result blood level sodium nitrite 80 nmol/L , level significantly level report normal ( 0.5 micromol/L 1 micromol/L ) . Thus , use modify accelerated titration design Phase I Clinical study . In accelerated design initial patient start dose 1 nmol/min/kg/48hr , i.e . 12 mg total 48 hour person weight 60 kg . Cohorts one new subject per dose level double dose step use initial accelerated stage . When first instance dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) observe dose level , next low dose level cohort expand three patient revert use conventional modify Fibonacci escalation/de-escalation . If DLT observe level 10 , cohort expand total three de-escalated appropriate . If one subject among three patient experience DLT dose , level 10 consider maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . The result 48-hour infusion phase 1 trial submit FDA initiation 14-day clinical study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must 2160 year age . Subjects must good health . Subjects must provide informed , write consent participation study . Female subject childbearing age must negative pregnancy test agree participate assessment menstrual cycle duration , , infusion .

Subjects red blood cell G6PD deficiency ( level low limit normal ) . Subjects history reaction medication substance characterize dyspnea cyanosis . Subjects baseline methemoglobin level great 1 % . Pregnant woman , since nitrite may cross placenta ; nitrite effect fetus unknown mother 's methemoglobinemia may dangerous fetus . Breastfeeding female , since nitrite cross breast milk could cause methemoglobinemia infant . Subjects blood pressure le 100/70 mmHg study day . Subjects treat nitrate ( e.g . nitroglycerin ) .</criteria>
