	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether engage music listen task reduce perception pain provide nondrug pain relief . Study hypotheses : 1 ) Performing highly engage listen task reduces psychophysiological arousal painful stimulus . 2 ) Psychophysiological arousal painful stimuli function complexity auditory signal . 3 ) Signal complexity task difficulty interact produce great engagement maximum reduction psychophysiological arousal painful stimulus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Music therapy involve use music promote , maintain , restore physical mental health . Music analgesia one aspect music therapy focus reduction pain use musical activity . This study build upon music analgesia data development new concept call music engagement . This concept base constructivist theory , presumes brain continuously construct revise model reality . Pain construct reality may prevent felt person actively engage construct another perceptual experience . Music listening activity require activation integration many complex cognitive emotional process ; therefore , actively engage music listen impede construction pain listener fully construct sustain music experience . This study determine whether engagement construction music listen experience reduce perception pain . This trial comprise two study require two day participation . At study start , participant electrode place finger non-dominant hand body part record skin conductance electrical brain activity . Participants also wear headset pupil movement measure . Tone synthesis software use generate different tone . In Study 1 , familiar tune , select participant , play background vary tone . Occasionally , note tune miss displace . Participants ask identify deviant note receive painful fingertip shock ; instruct focus task ignore shock . Study 1 consist three different condition ( easy , hard , condition ) . In easy condition , background tone occur far pitch range tune , make miss displace note easy detect . In hard condition , pitch range background tone adjacent tune , make tune difficult discern background tone . In task condition , participant hear familiar tune random background tone , instructed pay attention tune tone . Participants report pain experience retrospective report concurrent report . For retrospective report , participant report high , low , average level pain experienced preceding block trial . For concurrent report , participant give report level pain experience immediately follow shock episode . At two session participant take part , two set trial block , one pain report one without . There two block three music task condition total twelve block per session . Within block , sixteen 7- 11-second shock give . In Study 2 , participant take part two type listen task , one tone one tune background tone . There three task tone condition ( task , easy task , hard task ) . In task condition , participant hear repeat tone ; instruct pay attention tone . In easy condition , deviant tone easily detectable ; hard condition , less detectable . During condition , participant receive painful fingertip shock . The second task condition similar Study 1 ; participant listen familiar tune various tone background . Participants give fingertip shock ask identify deviant note easy hard condition . For task condition , participant instruct pay attention tune background tone . Participants required report pain part study . Participants receive two block trial six task condition . Fingertip shock vary intensity interval shock vary 7 11 second . Pain self-reports ( Study 1 ) , deviant note detection , skin conductance , pupil dilation , electroencephalogram change follow stimulation use assess participant .</detailed_description>
