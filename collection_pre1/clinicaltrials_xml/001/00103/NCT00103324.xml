	<brief_title>S0413 Lapatinib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Stomach Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess confirm response ( complete partial ) probability patient advanced/metastatic gastric cancer treat GW572016 . II . To assess time treatment failure overall survival group patient . III . To assess qualitative quantitative toxicity associate regimen . IV . To assess , preliminary manner , relationship protein expression gene expression EGFR , HER2 marker angiogenesis clinical outcome patient treat GW572016 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral lapatinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
