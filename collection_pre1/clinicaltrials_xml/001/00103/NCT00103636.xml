	<brief_title>Peripheral Venous Catheter Trial : 3 Day Versus No Routine Change</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among hospitalized patient , intravenous therapy common invasive procedure . It associate phlebitis rate 1.1 % 63 % central venous catheter relate bacteremia rate approximately 3.0 % . Catheter relate blood-stream infection attributable mortality rate 12 % 25 % . Factors think associated complication include insertion technique , catheter securement , type catheter use , type infusate additive , post-insertion catheter care length time catheter remain place . Current Centers Disease Control Guidelines provide direction intravenous therapy management include recommendation peripheral intravenous catheter re-sited every 72-96 hour . Data underpinning recommendation collect 1992 , decade ago . Since time , improvement catheter design composition , prospective surveillance study demonstrate safety longer dwell time . To date , observation validate adult , use randomize controlled trial methodology . Re-siting intravenous cannula cause discomfort patient high recurrent cost . The primary aim present study compare rate peripheral catheter-related blood stream infection , catheter-related local infection , phlebitis obstruction two group patient - routine catheter change every 72 hour catheter change clinically indicate . Specific hypothesis : That change intravenous peripheral catheter indicate clinical sign compare change intravenous catheter every 3 day reduces incidence intravenous catheter relate morbidity .</detailed_description>
