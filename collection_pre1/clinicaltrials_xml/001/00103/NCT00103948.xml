	<criteria>Age range Adult patient , 25 70 year age inclusive Gender distribution Men woman . Women childbearing potential ( &lt; 1 year postmenopausal ) must practice effective contraception negative serum bHCG Screening . Pregnant and/or lactate female exclude . Patients become pregnant study discontinue . Diagnostic evidence CADASIL either ( 1 ) identification NOTCH3 mutation ( exclude polymorphism ) ( 2 ) presence typical deposit electron microscopy skin biopsy . Cognitive impairment ( 1 ) Subjects study partner must give description cognitive problem one follow : ( 2a ) MMSE score 1027 ( inclusive ) ( 2b ) Trails B score , 1.5 standard deviation mean adjustment age education . Head MRI Evidence disease consistent CADASIL , evidence another disease , might account cognitive impairment dementia ( judged Investigator/physician site ) . ( The latter may determine CT head scan eligibility purpose . The MRI would still need . ) Must obtain within 6 month Screening/Baseline visit . If head MRI previously obtain , head MRI obtain part Screening/Baseline inclusion exclusion criterion ( except clinical laboratory determination ) satisfy . Patients MRI contraindicate CT instead , however , MRI prefer modality . Race ethnicity Any race ethnic group . Health Generally healthy , ambulatory ambulatoryaided ( i.e. , walker , cane wheelchair ) outpatient . Speech , motor function , comprehension , correct vision hearing must sufficient compliance test procedure . Clinical laboratory value must within normal limit , abnormal , must judge clinically insignificant Investigator/ physician . Patients Vitamin B12 deficiency stable dose medication least 12 week prior Screening/Baseline normal serum B12 level Screening/ Baseline eligible . Patients might otherwise eligible screen meet criterion . This stable dose Vitamin B12 must maintain throughout study . Patients hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism stable dose medication least 12 week prior Screening , normal TSH free T4 screening , consider euthyroid eligible . Patients might otherwise eligible rescreened meet criterion . This stable dose must maintain throughout study . Patients must reliable study partner regular contact patient ( e.g. , average 4 contact per week ) , observe possible adverse event , accompany patient visit . Patients history hypertension , cardiac disease , diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , may enrol study provide following standard meet . Hypertension must medication control ( sit SBP &lt; 175 , sit DBP &lt; 100 mm Hg ) cardiac disease ( e.g. , angina pectoris , congestive heart failure , right bundle branch block , arrhythmia ) stable appropriate medication 12 week prior Screening . Peripheral vascular disease must stable 12 week prior Screening . No elective surgical procedure plan course study ( e.g. , hernia repair bunion removal ) . Patient diabetes must stable demonstrated HbA1c &lt; = 8.0 % random serum glucose value &lt; = 170 mg/dL . All patient CADASIL risk stroke/TIA may enrol study provide new stroke diagnose identify occur within three month prior Screening . Patients might otherwise eligible screen 12 week stroke . Patients TIAs eligible without wait period . Patients already enrol continue study assess Investigator/ physician . Patients CADASIL may suffer depression . Such patient eligible enrollment stable medication 12 week MADRS score &lt; 20 . Patients MADRS score &gt; = 20 may rescreened 12 week stable dose medication . This stable dose must maintain throughout study . Minor medical condition must stable study enrollment . Patients take Gingko Biloba Vitamin E take stable dos compound 8 week allow study . This stable dose must maintain throughout study . Neurological disorder affect cognition ability assess associate CADASIL , Alzheimer 's Disease , Parkinson 's disease , normal pressure hydrocephalus , idiopathic seizure disorder , multiple sclerosis , cerebral vasculitis infection central nervous system , subdural hematoma , well Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) disease , history significant head trauma follow persistent neurological deficit , sleep disorder affect level consciousness , know structural brain abnormality . Psychiatric disorder affect ability ass cognition typically associate CADASIL , schizophrenia . Active drug alcohol abuse dependence &lt; = 5 year DSMIV criterion . Any active clinically significant condition affect absorption , distribution , metabolism study medication ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease , hepatic disease , severe lactose intolerance ) . Uncontrolled hypertension ( sit systolic &gt; = 175 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; = 100 mmHg ) assess Investigator regardless whether patient take antihypertensive medication . Evidence clinically significant , active gastrointestinal , renal , hepatic , respiratory , infectious , endocrine , cardiovascular system disease . A patient exclude , subsequently become stable 4 week , may become eligible enrollment Inclusion Criteria 2 ) 3 ) meet . Patients leave bundle branch block exclude . History malignant neoplasm ( include basal squamous cell carcinoma skin ) treat within 2 year prior study entry , current evidence malignant neoplasm , recurrent metastatic disease . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Patients and/or study partner unwilling unable fulfill requirement study . Known hypersensitivity cholinesterase inhibitor piperidinecontaining drug . Use unapproved prior concomitant medication define protocol . Any condition would make patient study partner , opinion Investigator , unsuitable study . Involvement investigational trial precede 12 week likely involvement investigational study drug trial course study . Prior enrollment , study director medical monitor must approve involvement investigational trial involve study drug . Patients change dos concomitant medication , otherwise describe , within 6 week prior enrollment .</criteria>
