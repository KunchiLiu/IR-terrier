	<brief_summary>This feasibility clinical investigation design demonstrate NeuroPace external Responsive Neurostimulator ( model eRNS-300 ) safely deliver responsive electrical stimulation automatically affect epileptiform activity . The eRNS-300 base implantable neurostimulator adapt acute , external use hospital setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study External Responsive Neurostimulator System Epileptiform Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Automated Response Spontaneous Epileptiform Activity use External Responsive Neurostimulator ( eRNS ) system clinical investigation involve subject undergo intracranial monitoring evaluation epilepsy surgery monitor hospital 's epilepsy monitoring unit . During subject 's participation , discretion investigator , subject connect eRNS . The eRNS investigational device attache standard intracranial electrode monitoring equipment monitor subject 's seizure activity . It anticipate subject may connect eRNS period time extend one day week . After subject enough seizure complete evaluation epilepsy surgery , physician may enable responsive stimulation setting eRNS . The subject 's participation clinical investigation complete prior removal intracranial electrode .</detailed_description>
