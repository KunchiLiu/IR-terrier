	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether commercially available anti-digoxin antibody , Digibind , delay delivery patient severe pre-eclampsia . If , would allow time maternally administer steroid prevent development respiratory complication premature infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Digibind Treatment Severe Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia ( PE ) serious complication third trimester pregnancy manifest high blood pressure , proteinuria , edema , encephalopathy sometimes seizure , hepatic failure . There know specific treatment , although palliative measure antihypertensive drug , magnesium , steroid early delivery improve outcome . Multiple abnormality demonstrate PE relation abnormality cause , pathophysiology treatment unknown . One abnormalities elevation circulate level `` digoxin-like '' factor ( EDLF ) , unknown substance cross react digoxin antibody inhibit Na , K ATPase . An extensive literature support hypothesis increase level EDLF may causative factor pathogenesis hypertension . Increased level factor find maternal fetal blood , normal pregnancy , pregnancy complicate PE . Levels factor high PE normal pregnancy suggest might play role pathophysiology PE . Digibind ( Glaxo Smith Kline ) commercially available FAB fragment , antidigoxin antibody approve treatment digoxin intoxication . In experimental model hypertension elevate EDLF level , Digibind show low blood pressure , suggest antibody cross react EDLF . These observation lead hypothesis Digibind might ameliorate manifestation PE , especially hypertension . Based extensive pre-clinical literature support hypothesis , encourage result 8 case , clinical trial plan test effect Digibind severe PE . The study multi- site , parallel , double blind , placebo control , randomize trial . After randomization , 50 patient give usual treatment severe PE , plus study drug ( Digibind placebo ) every six hour , 48 hour . The study may terminate treatment period standard indication early delivery . Data collection include : delivery latency , maternal blood pressure , antihypertensive use , renal function , hepatic function , CBC platelet count , umbilical artery blood flow color doppler . Standard maternal fetal monitoring follow . Newborn assessment include : status birth , APGAR score , NICU length stay , respirator use duration , medical complication . Adverse event record .</detailed_description>
