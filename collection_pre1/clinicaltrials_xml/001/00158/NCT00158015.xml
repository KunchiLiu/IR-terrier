	<brief_title>Prospective Minnesota Study ECHO Tissue Doppler Imaging Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) newly develop therapy design improve outcome patient heart failure ( HF ) . Recent study show significant symptomatic improvement decrease hospitalization mortality CRT . However , 30 % patient experience improvement invasive costly therapy . Tissue Doppler Imaging ( TDI ) emerge effective tool non-invasively assess mechanical dyssynchrony leave ventricle ( LV ) may aid identification LV mechanical dyssynchrony predict clinical response CRT . PROMISE-CRT design address follow hypothesis : Changes tissue doppler imaging measure leave ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony baseline one week follow cardiac resynchronization therapy correlate clinical response three month . Seventy HF patient clinically indicate receive CRT enrol six-month multi-center study conduct Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area . TDI analyse , measure clinical improvement LV remodeling conduct one week , three month , six month CRT implementation .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Heart Failure</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Moderate severe heart failure define NYHA class IIIIV despite optimal pharmacological heart failure therapy . Stable Heart failure define hospitalize within last month . A 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) obtain 90 day prior enrollment document sinus rate &gt; 50bpm , QRS duration &gt; 120ms PR interval &gt; 150ms Ejection Fraction &lt; 35 % document within last 6 month one follow method : echo ( standard TEE ) LV gram , MUGA Clinically indicate receive CRT Ability complete study visit include geographic stability Exclusion criterion : Serum creatinine &gt; 3.5 Have Myocardial infarct , unstable angina , percutaneous coronary intervention coronary artery bypass graft precede 30 day prior enrollment . Have previous cardiac resynchronization therapy , coronary venous pace/sense lead attempt LV lead placement . Dyspnea believe physician primarily relate lung disease . Have atrial tachyarrhythmia permanent ( ie terminate spontaneously terminate medical intervention ) persistent ( terminate medical intervention terminate spontaneously ) within 90 day prior enrollment Poor sinus node function MD predict require &gt; 70 % atrial pacing . Inability perform six minute walk . Life expectancy le 6 month due medical condition expect undergo heart transplant within next 6 month . Have mechanical tricuspid heart valve . Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy . Patients hypersensitivity 0.7mg nominal dose dexamethasone . Surgically uncorrected primary valvular heart disease . Patients currently enrol another investigational study would directly impact treatment outcome current study . Patients young 18 year age , pregnant , mentally incompetent sign patient inform consent .</criteria>
