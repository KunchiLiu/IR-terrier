	<brief_summary>Plasmodium vivax represent major health problem throughout tropic . Outside Africa account 50 % case , affect estimate 70-80 million people per year . A substantial proportion clinical case cause infective bite Anopheles spp , activation latent hypnozoites liver . These relapse may significantly impede development since illness may result 5-15 day absence work school . Primaquine ( PQ ) drug available eliminates hypnozoites , though use beset clinical problem ; may precipitate haemolytic anaemia individual deficient blood enzyme glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) . Without affordable G6PD testing , primaquine use preclude . Evidence suggest , however , course 8 weekly dos may safe effective alternative traditional 14 day course drug . The aim propose study , therefore , test whether 8 weekly dos primaquine effective 14 day course prevent relapse malaria , without risk hemolysis G6PD deficient individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eight Week Primaquine Regimen Treatment Vivax Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Old evidence suggest successful PQ therapy function length course treatment , circulate concentration drug , total dosage administer . The dose administer 7 day , 14 day , 8 week equally prevent relapse vivax malaria . The hemolysis see shorter course often self-limiting , suggest feedback mechanisms up-regulate production red cell response haemolytic challenge . The propose extended course likely well tolerate G6PD deficient individual result safeguard , especially population expose 5 day PQ regimen number year without report adverse effect . The aim study , therefore , test whether 8 week regimen prove effective , without associate risk haemolysis G6PD deficient individual . However , operational concern remain adherence protract treatment regimen . Therefore compare 8 week course 2 different group ; first directly observe dosing , second unsupervised dose use pre-packaged , foil wrap PQ appropriately label individual box , supply strong health education message . This would appropriate deployment resource-poor setting prove effective safe . Objectives : To evaluate whether eight week primaquine regimen , use single weekly dos , provide adequate radical cure vivax malaria experimental operational condition safe acceptable population glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency . The specific objective study set . 1 . Determine efficacy eight-week primaquine regime , use single weekly dos , prevent relapse P. vivax infection follow supervised versus unsupervised administration drug . 2 . Compare efficacy operational aspect ( e.g . adherence ) two week , eight week supervise eight week blister package regime . 3 . Monitoring effect 8 week PQ G6PD deficient individual . 4 . Examine user acceptability economic advantage course treatment . Study population : Vivax positive individual Adizai Baghicha refugee camp , Pakistan , Jalalabad , Afghanistan . Laboratory Examination : All suspect malaria case attend basic health unit thick thin blood film take examined conventional light microscopy . Cases diagnose P. vivax infection ask participate study unless exclusion criterion meet . All patient test G6PD deficiency near patient testing . The test colorimetric qualitative test G6PD red cell require 0.05 ml blood . In addition , filter paper blood spot collect allow molecular type parasite . This differentiate new relapse infection . Design Randomised placebo control study compare follow four study group : 1 . Initial 3 day chloroquine supervise weekly placebo 8 week . 2 . Initial 3 day chloroquine follow supervised 14 day primaquine treatment . 3 . Initial 3 day chloroquine follow supervise 8 week primaquine treatment ( 45 mg / week ) . All patient give health education message strongly advise complete course . In addition safety arm use G6PD deficient patient ; use compare PCV group 3 ( ) . This 8 week regimen , administer direct observation , receive close monitoring haemolysis . Treatment : All patient give full therapeutic course chloroquine . Primaquine administer study group accord respective protocol schedule . All relapse new case re-treated use regime procedure time admission . Monitoring : Patients treatment group 1 , 2 , 3 monitor initial 8 week treatment adverse event ; G6PD deficient patient monitor sign hemolysis every day first 2 week treatment per week ( prior dosing ) completion course . Following treatment period , patient monitor 1 year follow outcome : Primary Efficacy Variable : Proportion relapse ( ) P. vivax 12 month follow-up . Secondary Efficacy Variables : Time subsequent relapse episode , number relapse episodes 12 month , side effect / adverse event Patients advise return BHU event recurrent symptom within 12 month follow enrolment study . A patient deem complete study 12 month follow-up . In event patient contact every 2 week follow-up period order collect relevant information . At episode , sample blood allow molecular type parasite define whether patient new infection relapse .</detailed_description>
