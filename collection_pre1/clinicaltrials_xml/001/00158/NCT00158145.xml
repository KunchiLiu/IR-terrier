	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death United States . Approximately 90 % lung cancer cause cigarette smoking . While lung cancer case occur smoker ex-smokers , 15-25 % smoker get lung cancer . Currently remain impossible predict smoker get cancer . Each puff cigarette delivers , along nicotine , mixture 60 know carcinogen . Most carcinogens require metabolic activation negatively affect cell DNA cause cancer . Biomarkers quantify carcinogen level metabolic activity carcinogen useful tool available use . The purpose study assess variability tobacco smoke carcinogen biomarker level one year group smoker . This longitudinal observational study involve repeat measure analysis 6 different tobacco carcinogen biomarkers . Fifty current smoker intend continue smoke duration study recruit advertisement . Participants compensate time . Blood sample collect every two month one year . All sample analyze 6 different carcinogen biomarkers individual variability biomarker level assess .</detailed_description>
