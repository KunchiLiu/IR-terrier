	<brief_summary>The purpose trial evaluate effectiveness arthroscopy ( lavage debridement ) conjunction best available non-surgical treatment versus best available non-surgical treatment alone ( medication , health education physical therapy ) patient osteoarthritis knee .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery Versus Surgery OA Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis estimate affect half adult population , age 75 year , anticipate 85 100 elderly patient form disease . Osteoarthritis ( OA ) characterize moderate severe pain limit functional ability . It suspect cause debilitate pain include irritation synovium , excessive subchondral bone force raise intra-arterial pressure . The knee commonly affect weight-bearing joint . Osteoarthritis great social impact , second common reason work disability United States . The prevalence OA expect increase come year due increase longevity , increase proportion population age 75 year , increase diagnostic ability . Rather evaluation different form arthroscopic surgery ( ie lavage v debridement v abrasion ) treatment knee OA , feel important establish efficacy technology compare best non-surgical treatment alone . This evaluator- blind , phase III , single-centre , group sequential randomize controlled trial patient osteoarthritis knee . Treatment effectiveness base upon patient ' disease specific quality life 2 year use Western Ontario McMaster ( WOMAC ) Osteoarthritis Index . In addition patient ' physical function cost effectiveness assess . Costs estimate perspective health care system , patient , family , society include use hospital resource well economic implication lose workday associate alternative treatment . This randomized clinical trial provide high quality evidence determine role expensive treatment overall management OA .</detailed_description>
