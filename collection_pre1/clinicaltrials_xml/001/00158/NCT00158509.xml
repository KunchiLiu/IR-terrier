	<brief_title>Randomised Controlled Trial Assessing Impact Genital Herpes Suppressive Therapy HIV Shedding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection Herpes Virus Simplex type 2 ( HSV-2 ) likely represent main cofactor involve HIV transmission , either clinical episode asymptomatic genital shedding . However , definite proof concept never make randomise controlled trial . Furthermore , natural history HSV-2 infection poorly document sub-Saharan Africa , well efficacy antiviral drug virus transmission . The latter measure HSV-2 genital shed proxy . The objective research programme assess impact suppressive treatment genital herpes HIV genital shed among co-infected patient receive HAART need antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug . In order achieve objective , propose perform 2 randomise double blind control trial nest within ongoing cohort sex worker Bobo-Dioulasso . While increase HIV transmission HSV-2 infection stand main working hypothesis among HIV positive person , specific rationale individual take ARV follow : Does potential cofactor effect genital herpes HIV remain present immunity build ARV ? In word , HSV-2 infection public health issue group people . The role ARV HIV transmission also assess . These 2 trial perform use exactly methodology study treatment . We use parallel design baseline phase take account important inter-individual variability genital shedding . Each participant control . The baseline phase treatment phase consist 6 visit perform 2 week interval . The participant receive either placebo Valacyclovir 1g/day treatment phase ( 3 month ) . The outcome measure use qualitative quantitative measure HIV shedding . The analysis conduct use `` intention treat '' `` per protocol '' approach . At end project , work hypothesis much document woman take ARV . Furthermore , result constitute reference upcoming therapeutic vaccine trial . This work result collaboration Centre Muraz , UMR 36 `` AIDS associate disease '' ( Montpellier ) London School Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine .</detailed_description>
