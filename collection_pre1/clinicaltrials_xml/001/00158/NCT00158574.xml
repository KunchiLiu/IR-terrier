	<brief_summary>Malaria anaemia major cause morbidity mortality child sub-Saharan Africa . Administration three course sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine ( SP ) intermittent preventive treatment ( IPTi ) infant receive EPI vaccine reduce incidence malaria anaemia infant area low SP resistance , low transmission pressure high bednet use . However , clear whether observation generalise area high transmission high SP resistance . The mechanism protective effect IPTi unclear . There urgent need identify anti-malarial drug could use IPTi instead SP . This study objectives : 1 . Identification drug could use safely effectively IPTi instead SP area , north eastern Tanzania , high level resistance SP amodiaquine . 2 . Determination whether short act antimalarial drug ( Lapdap ) effective long act drug ( mefloquine ) use IPTi . 3 . Investigation effect intensity transmission requirement long short act drug IPTi . 4 . Assessment effect IPTi development clinical immunity child low high transmission area . A randomised trial four treatment regime propose conduct two different transmission setting . The four treatment regimen follow : ( 1 ) placebo ; ( 2 ) mefloquine ; ( 3 ) Lapdap ; ( 4 ) SP . All medication give time immunisation DPT/polio 2 , DPT/polio 3 , measles vaccine . The study involve 1280 infant high endemic area 2440 infant low endemic area , Tanzania.The primary outcome incidence clinical malaria .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Study design The overall study design randomise trial four treatment regime two different transmission setting . The four treatment regime follow : ( 1 ) placebo , ( 2 ) mefloquine ; ( 3 ) Lapdap ; ( 4 ) SP . All medication give time immunisation DPT/polio 2 , DPT/polio 3 , measles vaccine . 2 . Study procedures A list study infant due DPT/Polio 2 vaccination study EPI clinic give date generate enrolment database week prior schedule date . When study infant return DPT &amp; Polio 2 ( contact 1 ) follow procedure carry : ( 1 ) allocation infants one four arm study ; ( 2 ) administration first dose study drug dispensation remain two dos drug give home presence study field worker ; ( 3 ) collection blood sample Hb , malaria parasite blood spot genetic marker drug resistance parasites haemoglobinopathy ; ( 4 ) advice give caretaker bring child health facility child become ill next schedule visit . In study area , first 200 child follow day 7 post-administration IPTi first course ( contact 1a ) finger prick blood sample collect determination haemoglobin preparation blood film . When study infant return DPT &amp; Polio 3 ( contact 2 ) follow procedure carry : ( 1 ) administration first dose second course study drug dispensation remain two dos drug give home presence study field worker ; ( 2 ) advice give caretaker bring child health facility child become ill next schedule visit . When study infant return measles ( contact 3 ) follow procedure carry : ( 1 ) administration first dose third course study drug dispensation remain two dos drug give home presence study field worker ; ( 2 ) collection blood sample measles serology ; ( 3 ) advice give caretaker bring child health facility child become ill . In study area , second 200 child follow day 7 post-administration IPTi third course ( contact 3a ) finger prick blood sample collect determination haemoglobin preparation blood film . A list study infant due blood examination one month receive course 3 study drug generate contact3 database every month . These infant visit home ( contact 4 ) study team finger prick blood sample ( 400 μl ) collect determination Hb , blood film preparation malaria parasites measure anti-VSA antibody . A random sample 20 % infant visit home 11 month age two month 3rd course study drug ( contact 5 ) finger prick blood sample collect Hb blood film preparation . Another random sample 20 % child visit home 12 month age 3 month 3rd course drug ( contact 6 ) finger prick blood collect Hb blood film preparation . Infant blood sample take 11 month age exclude sample infant select collection blood sample 12 month age . . All study child visit home age approximately 18 month ( contact 7 ) finger prick blood sample ( 400 μl ) obtain determination Hb , blood film preparation malaria parasites measure anti-VSA antibody . All child visit home age approximately 24 month ( contact 8 ) finger prick blood sample obtain screen malaria use Optimal dipstick also preparation blood slide , filter paper sample Hb . If child positive dipstick test , currently febrile ( Temp &gt; 37.5° C ) history fever within past 2 day , and/or history take SP febrile illness previous week , child treat quinine . If dipstick test positive malaria history fever within past 2 day history use SP within past week , child give full treatment course one three antimalarial drug use IPTi ie SP , Lapdap mefloquine , allocate randomly . The randomisation treatment regime do block 6 . Within block six envelope , two contain LapDap , two contain MQ Lapdap placebo day 2 3 , two contain SP Lapdap placebo day 2 3 . A random sample 10 % child visit day3 ass whether drug give child urine sample take approximately 200 child ( select randomly year ) test mefloquine , dapsone pyrimethamine use high performance liquid chromatography . All child treat antimalarial drug follow post treatment day 14 ( contact 9 ) day 28 ( contact 10 ) . On two visit finger prick blood sample take examination malaria parasite filter paper sample obtain subsequent determination resistance marker SP Lapdap . Randomisation allocation study group The unit randomization individual infant . Infants allocate one study group permute block randomization . Each study drug , include placebo , assign 4 group code ; 16 study group total study site colour cod . An independent statistician ( Dr Tom Smith ) prepare randomization scheme preparatory phase study . 233 block 16 blister pack study drug [ 80 block ( 1280/16 = 80 ) high transmission area , 153 block ( 2448/16 = 153 ) low transmission area ] prepare study drug code keep independent statistician . The tablet crush mixed syrup time administration . The first dose administer EPI clinic designate member study team . The drug day 2 3 dispensed blister pack caretaker advise administer drug home . The level compliance side effect drug monitor compliance assessment team home visit make day 2 day 3 . If drug give caretaker , project staff administer drug consent caretaker . Oral administration mefloquine induce vomit child suffer clinical malaria . We observe incidence vomit initial period three month report information Data , Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . If incidence vomit significant , DSMB may recommend schedule mefloquine administration change split dose ( 15 mg /kg day 1 10 mg/kg day 2 ) . Monitoring compliance safety Compliance three day medication assess field staff visit day 2 3 . Urine sample collect random basis throughout course trial day 3 visit test mefloquine , dapsone pyrimethamine use high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . Determining safety acceptability mefloquine Lapdap use IPTi major objective study . This accomplish three main way : 1 . Changes haemoglobin week follow treatment measure related presence absence parasitaemia fever time treatment . Data 16 treatment group collate investigator give DSMB ask break code subject determine concern fall Hb approximately 200 infant receive Lapdap . It possible compare finding child child receive mefloquine , SP placebo . If necessary , G-6-P-D status determine child show drop Hb match control . 2. . At time day 3 follow-up , questionnaire complete asks health infant since time drug administration . 3. . An adverse event report system establish health centre participate trial . Any severe adverse event report chair DSMB GSK within 48 hour . Drugs use IPTi must suppressive immune response EPI vaccine give concurrently . An impact measles vaccination issue concern . Therefore , serum sample collect age 9 month administer measles vaccination one month administration vaccine . Antibody concentration DPT antigen may measure sample . Surveillance clinical malaria All study infant encourage attend study health facility illness . At visit health questionnaire complete temperature record use electronic thermometer . A finger prick blood sample collect Hb malaria parasite detection molecular marker resistance infant attend study health facility illness clinically diagnose malaria . Children proven presumptive malaria treat quinine accord MoH guideline manage treatment failure follow first line drug . To ensure IPTi study drug lead rebound incidence severe malaria anaemia second year life infant enrol study follow reach age 24 month . During second year life , episodes possible malaria anaemia infant present health centre study area document . Monitoring trial The trial conduct condition good clinical practice ( GCP ) , follow closely possible ICH guideline . Standard operate procedure ( SOPs ) develop major operation . A DSMB establish look trial . Discussions hold DSMB prior start trial identify requirement adverse event report met . The DSMB also consult advisability interim analysis , particular SP group drug may prove ineffective . At study site , local physician assign local safety monitor . In event serious adverse event associate study drug , local safety monitor empower break code child , consider necessary temporarily suspend trial , prior discussion DSMB . It propose clinical monitor appoint IPTi consortium monitor trial conduct auspex anticipate monitor visit study site least one occasion trial provide advice help ensure study conduct high clinical standard .</detailed_description>
