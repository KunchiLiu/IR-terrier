	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate two type exercise therapy design improve muscle power mobility : weighted vest exercise vs. progressive resistance training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Weighted Vest Exercise Strength Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle power , separate physical attribute strength , important determinate physical functioning elderly , example avoid impend fall , rise chair , climb stair . Muscle power , decline age different rate strength , show previous study improve power training utilizing specially design exercise equipment . However , weight vest exercise could provide acceptable , low cost , readily accessible alternative . The hypothesis test study : 1 ) weight vest exercise improve low extremity power compare age match control standardized progressive resistance training program ; 2 ) improvement low extremity power enhance functional performance show improved gait velocity , stair climb , chair rise time ; 3 ) weight vest exercise impaired old adult improve self-reported function disability . One hundred sixty-four men woman age 65 older , physical limitation able climb stair independently , randomize one two 16-week exercise program . The intervention group participate weight vest exercise protocol , consist chair-based stair-climbing exercise , control group participate standardize progressive resistance training program . Participants program meet three time per week 30-60 minute per session , total 16 week , research exercise gym , direct supervision research staff .</detailed_description>
