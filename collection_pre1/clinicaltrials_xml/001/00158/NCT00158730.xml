	<detailed_description>To evaluate compare two AmBisome dose regimen initial treatment invasive aspergillosis filamentous fungal infection diagnose modify EORTC criterion immunocompromised patient , determine overall response rate end course treatment . Determine compare follow parameter two treatment arm : - Safety tolerability - Survival rate rate infection relapse 4 week Post Treatment . - Survival rate 12 week study entry . - Time favorable overall response time End Treatment patient favorable overall response . - Cumulative dose study drug give End Treatment .</detailed_description>
