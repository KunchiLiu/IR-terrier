	<detailed_description>Objectives : To examine patient satisfaction , treatment safety , symptom reduction associate treatment symptom distress and/or depressed mood among post acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) patient , compare usual cardiology care . Research Design : The Study utilizes Phase-I RCT design achieve Aim . Methodology : Patients confirm ACS screen symptom distress and/or depressed mood within 7 day index ACS event , use Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) . Those meet inclusion criterion BDI ( score &gt; 10 ) consenting study follow 3-months , time re-assessed . Those continue show BDI score &gt; 10 consenting , randomize intervention condition ( INT ) usual cardiologic care ( UCC ) . INT define 6-months patient preference , step care treatment whereby patient chose brief , problem-focused psychotherapy ( PST ) antidepressant medication ( MED ) . Patients re-evaluated 2- 4-months randomization . Those show sufficient improvement symptom receive augment therapy . Those initially choose PST receive frequent session and/or addition MED ; initially choose MED receive change agent , increase dosage , additional medication , and/or PST . Hypotheses test : 1 . Patient satisfaction within intervention treatment ( INT ) high usual cardiologic care ( UCC ) condition , evidence self-report level participation 2 . The INT group experience great reduction symptom distress and/or depression treatment period UCC group ( secondary hypothesis ) . 3 . Improvement symptom distress and/or depression associate reduction level inflammatory marker improvement adherence physician prescribe aspirin therapy ( secondary hypothesis ) . This multi-site study involve Mt . Sinai , Yale Columbia University Schools Medicine . A total 500 people screen initial 'observational period ' , occur time new ACS diagnosis . From among , anticipate 200 people evidence persistent BDI &gt; 10 3-month follow-up agree enrol Phase 1 RCT . The clinical relevance Study concern demonstration acceptability satisfaction treatment approach post-ACS patient , preliminary Phase-III RCT would test effect intervention event-free survival ACS .</detailed_description>
