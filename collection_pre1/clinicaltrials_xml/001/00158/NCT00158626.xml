	<brief_title>Does Doing Pelvic Floor Exercise Ease Symptoms Women Living With Prolapse ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse common female condition ; estimate 50 % woman experience degree prolapse 30 % attendee gynaecology clinic present problem . Vaginal delivery cite main cause prolapse menopause , heavy lifting , chronic cough straining also important factor . Symptoms associate prolapse backache , pelvic heaviness bladder , bowel sexual dysfunction . Thus , condition debilitate greatly affect sufferer 's daily activity quality life . Traditionally , treatment prolapse consist surgery conservative treatment . Surgical procedure repair fascia vary improve technique constantly seek . At present however recurrence rate prolapse surgery 25 % , 80 % re-occurring within two year surgery . Conservative treatment often consider prolapse small patient good candidate surgery . There three type conservative treatment : 1 ) Physical intervention aim improve pelvic floor muscle function use pelvic floor muscle assessment exercise , neuromuscular electrical stimulation , 2 ) Mechanical intervention aim manage prolapse support pelvic area ( e.g . use vaginal ring pessary ) , 3 ) Lifestyle intervention ( weight loss reduce exacerbate activity ) seek avoid exacerbation prolapse decrease intra-abdominal pressure . The promotion pelvic floor exercise ( PFEs ) prolapse varies hospital provide patient information leaflet others give individual instruction physiotherapist . Such programme refer pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) . An ongoing Cochrane review literature , date , find evidence management pelvic organ prolapse use PFMT . This proposal address gap research evidence develop multi-centre randomise control trial PFMT intervention woman prolapse . The feasibility aspects trial assess , pilot data collect two Scottish Centres ( Glasgow Aberdeen ) . Ultimately , multi-centre trial would aim establish PFMT well standardise management reduce prolapse specific symptom , prolapse severity , need surgical prolapse repair cost associated condition . 50 woman attend out-patient clinic suitable study randomise either control intervention arm trial . Women intervention arm receive individualise programme PFMT deliver physiotherapist via 5 session physiotherapy 16 week period . This programme include pelvic muscle assessment , teach prescription pelvic floor exercise , provision lifestyle advice . Women control arm receive , post , lifestyle advice leaflet . Type severity prolapse quantify accord ICS guideline ( POP-Q method ) . Data outcome measure relate improvement prolapse symptom associate quality life obtain via self-completion questionnaire</detailed_description>
