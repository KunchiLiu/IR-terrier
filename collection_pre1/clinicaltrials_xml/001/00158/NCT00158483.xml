	<detailed_description>Objectives . The propose project randomise placebo-controlled , double-blinded , multicentric therapeutic trial evaluate association antiherpetic treatment syndromic treatment management genital ulcer Africa , impact genital shed HIV Herpes simplex hominis type 2 ( HSV-2 ) virus . Background . Recent epidemiological study show infection HSV-2 highly prevalent sub-Saharan Africa , HSV-2 seropositivity marker high-risk sexual behaviour . HSV-2 infection increasingly recognise one commonest cause genital ulceration many African country . HSV-2 infection may act major cofactor HIV transmission , fact long underestimated . First , genital ulcer ( cause HSV-2 ) cofactor HIV transmission , either increase infectiousness dually infected individual ( HSV+/HIV+ ) , increase susceptibility seronegative partner . Second , HSV-2 infection may transactivate vivo genital replication HIV , thereby increase infectiousness dually infected individual . Rationale main objective . HSV-2 infection - cofactor HIV transmission - target anti-herpetic specific drug , either continuous prophylactic treatment asymptomatic shed phase , episodic treatment clinically-apparent genital ulceration . The main objective trial demonstrate acyclovir treatment give clinical episode ( primary infection recurrence ) reduce genital shed free- cell-associated HIV , thereby contribute reduction HIV infectiousness dually infected individual ( HIV+/HSV+ ) . Given present state knowledge hypothesis formulate around possible role HSV HIV epidemic Africa , propose research contribute confirm invalidate existence mutual reinforcement HSV HIV replication . This represent study biological plausibility vivo interaction . In addition choose intervention strategy practical operational implication allow evaluation novel approach syndromic management genital ulcer Africa could later lead revision management guideline . Methods . Approximately 600 woman present genital ulcer enrol two year two site : Bangui ( Central African Republic ) Accra ( Ghana ) . The syndromic management patient include antibiotic cover presumptive bacterial cause genital ulceration setting ( chancroid syphilis ) , accord national international guideline ( CDC , UK national guideline , WHO ) . In addition , woman randomise receive either antiherpetic treatment ( acyclovir 400 mg 3 time daily 5 day , accord UK national guideline - short regimen US guideline ) placebo ( similar frequency duration ) . Clinical examination cervicovaginal sampling carry D0 follow visit D2 , D4 , D7 , D14 &amp; D28 . These sample test : etiological diagnosis ulcer multiplex PCR ; measurement HIV genital viral load ( measure free RNA cell-associated proviral DNA ) HSV-2 DNA genital load ; diagnosis common STDs ( D0 ) . Blood sample collect D0 , D2 D28 HIV , syphilis HSV-2 serological assay , HIV plasma load well CD4 measurement . The main outcome determination impact anti-herpetic treatment HIV genital load ( corollary , HSV2 genital load ) . It also possible measure impact antibiotic treatment HIV viral load . The study allow evaluate validity novel syndromic treatment approach genital ulcer disease , long term outcome may necessary revision syndromic management guideline GUD potentially include anti-herpetic treatment .</detailed_description>
