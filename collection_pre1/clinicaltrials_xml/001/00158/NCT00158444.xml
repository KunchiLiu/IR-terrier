	<brief_summary>Patients large unstable Grade IV articular surface defect , significant subchondral bone exposure likely receive joint replacement receive HemiCAP™ Femoral Resurfacing Prosthesis . The Subject Device intend offer surgical alternative patient might otherwise endure year pain loss function await appropriate age joint replacement surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study HemiCAP™ Unicondylar Femoral Resurfacing Prosthesis . ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective propose clinical investigation determine safety effectiveness investigational device management pain restoration joint function part interim clinical treatment strategy . This pivotal , prospective , non-randomized , non-comparative , open label clinical study , evaluate safety effectiveness HemiCAP™ Femoral Resurfacing Prosthesis . The study involve 15 qualified investigational site . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion consent coordinator study centre receive baseline evaluation knee exam . Standard radiographs take subject fill quality life questionnaire . The surgical procedure take place within 1 month baseline evaluation . Follow-up evaluation occur 2 week , 6 week 3 month follow surgery . At evaluation , radiographs take patient fill post-op progress satisfaction assessment form . Any concomitant medication adverse event document . In addition 6 , 12 24 month follow surgery , patient fill quality life questionnaire .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We include Canadians study Preoperative Patients must meet follow criterion eligible enrol study : Patient age great equal 40 year . Articular surface defect locate medial lateral femoral condyle . Articular surface defect penetrate expose subchondral bone . Clinical symptom meet criterion establish Cincinnati Knee Rating System , Symptom Rating Form Patient Grade less equal 5 ( 110 scale ) , Pain associate function less equal 5 ( 110 scale ) symptom weight bear pain significantly limit patient quality life . Patient must fail conservative care ) undergone recognize arthroscopic surgical intervention , previous marrow stimulation cartilage repair ( drilling , microfracture abrasion ) ; appropriate candidate surgical intervention b ) undergone recognize arthroscopic intervention treatment defect , include patient suffer Avascular Necrosis ( AVN ) . Patient exhibit overall well , sign informed consent form , willing follow instruction comply activity restriction . Patient understands willing comply followup requirement study.IntraOperative Inclusion CriteriaPatients must meet follow intraoperative criterion include study : Articular surface defect largely circumscribe 15mm 20mm diameter circular size guide . Articular surface defect locate relatively central femoral condyle resurface implant extend beyond limit condyle . 1 . Patient obese , define BMI &gt; 30kg/m2 , screen . 2 . Patient know infected HIV acquire AIDS . 3 . Patient known history substance abuse . 4 . Patient display varus joint malalignment , affect limb , great 2º anatomic 7º mechanical . 5 . Patient present evidence metabolic disorder , may impair formation heal bone . 6 . Patient present evidence infection remote site , may spread implant site . 7 .
