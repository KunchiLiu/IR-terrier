	<brief_summary>The Three Aims study ( study Aim 1 complete ) 1 . Measure impact citicoline marihuana use pattern subject ' individualized natural setting response marihuana challenge use functional brain MRI scan . Hypothesis - 2 g/day citicoline produce great reduction marihuana use crave heavy marihuana user placebo citicoline 8-week treatment period measure natural environment . The participant experience great improve brain activation pattern improvement cognitive functioning compare placebo control subject . 2 . Measure effect citicoline marihuana absorption metabolism determine change parallel change subjective physiological response laboratory set . Hypothesis - Chronic ( 8 week ) treatment 2 g/day citicoline produce increase subjective physiological effect acute marihuana smoking placebo marihuana smoking compare chronic placebo citicoline . Citicoline effect marihuana pharmacokinetics . 3 . Measure effect citicoline marijuana-induced cue-induced craving brain electrical activity ( EEG ) . Hypothesis - Chronic ( 8 week ) treatment 2 g/day citicoline reduce objective measure marijuana cue-reactivity , subjective report crave response marihuana cue also attenuate compare chronic placebo citicoline treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Marijuana dependence important public health problem United States , yet still effective therapy available . It unclear marijuana affect brain function acute chronic use . Knowing change brain function marijuana dependence would aid understanding neurobiological basis marijuana abuse serve foundation development new treatment medication disorder . New improved brain imaging technique , functional MRI ( fMRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , allow view subtle , yet important , change brain function . Citicoline use treat victim head trauma neurodegenerative disorder . It find effective reduce cocaine use craving , know side effect . It also show reduce marijuana use . This likely due citicoline 's ability reduce insomnia craving , act mild antidepressant , improve cognitive function . How citicoline reduces drug use may relate effect cerebral blood flow and/or brain phospholipid metabolism reward area brain . This study determine whether citicoline alters marijuana use pattern , reduces crave , affect brain phospholipid metabolism marijuana-dependent people . The outcome study could offer important insight pathophysiology course marijuana dependence . Furthermore , study 's outcome could potentially relate drug dependence disorder .</detailed_description>
