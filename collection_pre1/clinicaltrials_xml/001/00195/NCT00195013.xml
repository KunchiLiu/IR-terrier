	<brief_title>Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial Glutamine Breast Cancer Patients With Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Determine whether oral glutamine supplementation reduce symptom sign peripheral neuropathy . 2 . Determine whether alteration symptom sign peripheral neuropathy correlate alteration circulate nerve growth factor insulin-like growth factor level . 3 . Assess whether oral glutamine affect circulate nerve growth factor insulin-like growth factor level . 4 . Assess whether glutamine interferes paclitaxel pharmacokinetics</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm breast cancer , Stage I , II , III IV solid tumor . 2 . Patients must receive weekly paclitaxel nabpaclitaxel chemotherapy recently complete paclitaxel nabpaclitaxel chemotherapy least Grade I peripheral neuropathy ( see Appendix A ) therapy . 3 . Because dose adverse event data currently available use glutamine patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric phase 1 singleagent trial . 4 . ECOG performance status &lt; 1 ( Karnofsky &gt; 90 % ) . 5 . Life expectancy great 3 month . 6 . Patients must sufficient organ marrow function paclitaxel treatment administer . 7 . The effect glutamine develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 8 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients experience prior neuropathy associate chemotherapy 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 3 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 4 . There known allergy associate glutamine . 5 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness render patient ineligible receive paclitaxel chemotherapy . 6 . Pregnant woman exclude study unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother glutamine . Breastfeeding also discontinue mother treated glutamine . 7 . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction glutamine . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . 8 . Concurrent chemotherapy another drug know cause neuropathy ( CDDP CBDCA oxaliplatin ) exclude .</criteria>
