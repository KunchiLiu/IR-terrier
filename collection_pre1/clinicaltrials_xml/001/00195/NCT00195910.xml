	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Hydromorphone Morphine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There widespread agreement pain under-treated ED ( 18 ) . The current recommend treatment acute pain ED set administration initial bolus morphine follow titration adequate analgesia achieve ( 19,20 ) . Several study show even 0.1 mg/kg IV morphine ( 7-10 mg administer average 70-100 kg patient ) inadequately treat many patient ’ acute pain ( 21,22 ) . In spite , observe many emergency physician nurse hesitant give 7-10 mg morphine initial IV dose . In contrast , observe healthcare provider similarly reluctant administer roughly equianalgesic dose hydromorphone ( 1-1.5 mg ) , perhaps potent hydromorphone give much small milligram quantity morphine , thus provide illusion substantially less opioid administer patient . Having repeatedly observe phenomenon , reason small milligram dose hydromorphone show provide efficacy , safety , side-effect profile comparable superior large milligram dose morphine , would provide evidence support use hydromorphone alternative first line opioid treatment acute pain present ED . As practical corollary , reason increase willingness healthcare provider use hydromorphone might contribute reduce one component multifaceted problem oligoanalgesia ED ( 18 ) .</detailed_description>
