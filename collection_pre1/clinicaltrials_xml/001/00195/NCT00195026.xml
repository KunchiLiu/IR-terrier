	<brief_title>Infrared Imaging ( Breast Scan IR ) Early Breast Cancer Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research study evaluate sensitivity specificity new non-invasive digital infrared image system adjunctive test breast cancer detection ( approved FDA 21 CFR 884.2980 ) . The technology device ( BreastScan IRÃ” ) develop Infrared Sciences Corp. undergone 3 year preliminary testing . The device 's utility investigate regard sensitivity detect breast cancer , ability identify size breast cancer . Additionally , negative predictive value device investigate . This device diagnose breast cancer , however record temperature data physiological parameter breast , compare database patient know breast health . The examination process simple non-invasive . The patient sits disrobe waist , appropriately position ergonomic chair arm support eye level . Temperature control air flow direct breast 4-minute interval infrared camera record skin surface cool 250 frame per minute . The stored image feed proprietary computer software design extract specific thermal parameter , include various temperature difference thermal symmetry measurement . Additionally , software focus area breast , compare immediate surroundings , behave abnormally . The program produce color cod post-processed image breast show one identify site , well result measure parameter . The combination parameter evaluate risk weight `` evaluation '' algorithm , determine information database . The result digital infrared scan correlate result subsequent breast biopsy . Selected patient require sign inform consent form . These patient recommend biopsy , base either mammography ultrasound . The patient overall breast density note . Each patient `` imaged '' BreastScan IR system , raw data store . The computer analyze raw data , produce report show result test . This report store use result patient 's biopsy know . For patient , report provide evaluation `` risk '' well data help localize suspicious site . Comparison make actual radiology pathology result . If patient determine biopsy form breast cancer , atypical hyperplasia , investigator examine BreastScan IR report , verify patient evaluate `` Risk '' ( one positive risk sign ) . If sufficient information provide pathology radiology report determine site ( ) breast , investigator verify BreastScan IR report correctly localize breast quadrant know cancer . The incidence incorrect evaluation record determination system 's sensitivity breast cancer . If patient determine biopsy non-malignant condition , cyst fibroadenoma , investigator determine BreastScan IR report evaluate patient `` Normal '' ( zero positive sign ) `` Risk '' . Methodology : Two hundred ( 200 ) female patient select normal screen process . Those patient find suspicious cancer ( BIRADS 3 ) highly suspicious cancer ( BIRADS 4,5 ) , and/or schedule biopsy , include study . The patient ask sign inform consent form . Data : The data collect trial blind patient well radiologist . The data individual patient store locally , within BreastScan IR system , available anyone except authorized research investigator . The data store future use analysis . Since data must compare actual radiology/pathology report , data anonymous , confidential . Patient Risk : The test completely non-invasive , present risk whatsoever patient . The infrared camera record infrared energy emit patient 's body . Cool air excessively cold , present discomfort patient . Benefits : The main objective test develop tool help diagnose breast cancer provide accurate adjunctive information patient 's doctor . Preliminary study indicate test 99 % sensitive breast cancer . A patient `` normal '' ( negative ) result small chance occult cancer still harbor breast . Conversely , patient abnormal test require work-up . We hope benefit two group woman account large proportion `` miss '' cancer . Namely , woman dense breast tissue , woman 40 pre-mammography age , generally dense breast tissue . A non-invasive test help improve screening , urgently need improve detection statistic group , hopefully lead early intervention patient high risk .</detailed_description>
