	<brief_summary>The main purpose study assess impact exercise training ( aerobic exercise , resistance exercise , combine aerobic resistance exercise ) versus sedentary wait list control glycemic control ( reflect reduce hemoglobin A1c [ HbA1c ] ) , body composition ( weight , body mass index [ BMI ] , waist circumference , total body fat , visceral subcutaneous abdominal fat , mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area ) , lipid ( Apo-B , Apo-A1 , Apo-B/A1 ratio , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) particle diameter , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ) quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diabetes Aerobic Resistance Exercise ( DARE ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . The incidence type 2 diabetes mellitus Western world rise rapidly due increase obesity sedentary behaviour , diabetes among potent common risk factor premature disability mortality . Landmark clinical trial UK Prospective Diabetes Study prove excess risk type 2 diabetes reduce relatively modest improvement glycemic control ( HbA1c difference 0.9 % time ) . The excess morbidity mortality diabetes attributable hyperglycemia cluster metabolic disturbance associate insulin resistance , exercise beneficial effect abnormality . The standard recommendation people diabetes perform aerobic exercise brisk walking , swimming , jogging . There little research resistance exercise ( weight lift exercise weight machine ) type 2 diabetes . Resistance exercise non-diabetic subject increase lean body mass , result increase metabolic rate , decrease insulin resistance increase glucose disposal . Furthermore , recent randomize trial addition resistance exercise cardiac rehabilitation program result marked improvement quality life , far great extent see aerobic exercise alone . For reason , feel resistance exercise type 2 diabetes modality worthy research . A pilot study present proposal , fund Canadian Diabetes Association ( CDA ) progress ; compliance excellent &gt; 90 % attendance . Primary research question : In patient type 2 diabetes , 6-month resistance aerobic train program result improve glycemic control reflect reduced hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) ? Is effect one type exercise additive ? Secondary research question : In patient type 2 diabetes , effect exercise modality : 1 . Body composition ( assessed use gold-standard method include CT scan deuterium oxide ) , rest energy expenditure ( use indirect calorimetry ) insulin resistance ? To extent change parameter mediate change HbA1c ? 2 . Important nontraditional metabolic CHD risk factor ( LDL particle diameter , plasma insulin , apoprotein B , c-reactive protein , free fatty acid ) traditional metabolic CHD risk factor ( HDL-C , LDL-C , triglyceride , total/HDL cholesterol ratio , BP ) ? 3 . Health-related quality life ( QOL ) measure Well-Being questionnaire SF-36 ? Does modality exercise change quality life baseline 6 month predict frequency exercise 6 month follow intervention ? Study design : Randomized controlled trial . After 4-week supervise low-intensity exercise run-in period test compliance , previously inactive Type 2 diabetic subject currently engage regular exercise randomize 4 arm : aerobic exercise 3X per week , resistance exercise 3X per week , combine waiting-list control . The exercise intervention take place YMCA branch metropolitan Ottawa . Exercise closely supervise progressive intensity duration . Compliance verify direct supervision , completion detail exercise log , central automate electronic track YMCA attendance scan membership card . Primary outcomes measure 6 month . At end 6 month subject give maintenance program reexamine 6 month later assess durability benefit exercise program . During 6 month intervention period diet standardized use repeated session dietitian , dose medication alter glucose , lipid BP hold constant unless change medically urgent . Significance : The global burden type 2 diabetes increase , complication illness occur primarily whose glycemic control fair poor . If appropriately select exercise training improve glycemic control adopt patient , likely morbidity associate type 2 diabetes decrease . This particularly true training also improve quality life , people thus inclined continue exercise long term .</detailed_description>
