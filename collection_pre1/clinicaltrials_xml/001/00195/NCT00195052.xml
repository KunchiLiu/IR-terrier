	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop technique intraoperative identification human functional epileptiform cortex use intrinsic signal imaging . The investigator propose ability optically monitor neuronal activity large area cortex `` real-time '' sensitive time-saving method electrical method currently available . The application technique theoretically increase safety efficacy many neurosurgical procedure , useful investigational tool study human cortical physiology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrinsic Optical Imaging Study Map Neocortical Seizure Human Epilepsy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epilepsy disease affect 1-2 % population . Currently , know cure epilepsy surgery , much effective eliminate seizure arise medial temporal lobe compare neocortex . The problem neocortical epilepsy population neuron underlie epileptiform discharge varies time . In addition , spatial relationship interictal event ictal onset zone , critical define region epileptogenesis , well understood essential surgical treatment epilepsy . Electrophysiological record method , although currently `` gold standard '' mapping epilepsy , inadequate address question base restriction due volume conduction sample limitation . Optical record technique overcome many limitation sample large area cortex simultaneously provide information blood flow , metabolism extracellular fluid shift intimately related excitatory inhibitory neuronal activity . In fact , optical recording may actually sensitive certain aspect epileptic activity electrophysiologic recording . The goal translate finding operate room map human neocortical epilepsy optical technique . Outcome follow surgical resection treat neocortical epilepsy correlate optical map determine utility intrinsic signal image guide brain surgery . These experiment set groundwork implement optical recording general clinical practice novel technique map predict human seizure .</detailed_description>
