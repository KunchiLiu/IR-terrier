	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Evaluation Antibiotic Regimen Following Appendectomy Perforated Appendicitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triple antibiotic therapy provide broad spectrum coverage gram positive , gram negative anaerobic bacteria long standard treatment perforate appendicitis child . This regimen traditionally consist ampicillin , gentamicin , clindamycin . The dose regimen medication quite frequent , follow : ampicillin ( every 6 hour ) , gentamicin ( every 8 hour ) , clindamycin ( every 8 hour ) , evidence postoperative infection , usually 5 7 day . Further , gentamicin aminoglycoside know renal ototoxic side effect . Its therapeutic window small necessitating measurement serum level maintain therapeutic level avoid toxicity . The contemporary selection antibiotic include drug require monitoring . Monotherapy new broad-spectrum agent piperacillin/tazobactam intraabdominal infection recently demonstrate equally efficacious traditional triple therapy . Such data call question need onerous antibiotic regimen include nephrotoxic agent ( gentamycin ) . However , benefit monotherapy outweigh increased expense antibiotic , ongoing cumbersome dose schedule 3-4 dos daily . We recently move dual antibiotic regimen ( ceftriaxone metronidazole ) provide excellent antimicrobial coverage dose daily dose schedule identical duration therapy triple antibiotic regimen . This regimen proven effective adult intraabdominal infection perforate appendicitis . Further , ceftriaxone plus metronidazole show equal aforementioned monotherapy schedule piperacillin/tazobactam child complicate perforated appendicitis . The advantage dual antibiotic therapy day dose child perforate appendicitis immense , especially antibiotic well tolerate , less expensive , simple dosing schedule . Additionally , neither drug nephrotoxic ; broad therapeutic range therefore require serum level measurement . This translate less blood draw , less time patient need receive infusion , less utilization nursing resource . These advantage would expect culminate great nursing patient satisfaction . The purpose study scientifically compare traditional triple antibiotic regimen dual antibiotic regimen child perforate appendicitis , quantify significance , report finding physicians care child . This prospective randomize study involve child undergo appendectomy perforated appendicitis . All patient receive antibiotic ( ceftriaxone flagyl ) preoperatively . The determination perforation make surgeon time operation . Perforation determine either identify perforation appendix , identify anaerobic odor emanate abdominal cavity operation ( sniff test ) . Once perforated appendicitis document , parents/guardians patient inform option participate prospective randomize study . Patients whose parent agree consent enroll study randomize one 2 group base sequential randomization number create Steve Simon , PhD . Based power analysis length stay , perform Dr. Simon , 50 patient two arm study provide power 82 % alpha level 0.05 . Dr. Simon feel level appropriate study . The control group consist triple antibiotic coverage ampicillin 50mg/kg every 6 hour , gentamicin 2.5 mg/kg every 8 hour clindamycin 10mg/kg every 6 hour , standard dosing regimen . The experimental group receive ceftriaxone 50mg/kg day ( maximum dose = 2 gram ) metronidazole 30mg/kg day ( maximum dose = 1 gram ) day dose . The length antibiotic therapy differ standard management remain standardized arm . All patient receive minimum 5 day therapy ( regardless group randomization ) . At time , afebrile least 24 hour , white blood cell ( WBC ) count obtain , within normal limit , antibiotic discontinue . If , 5 day therapy , patient remain febrile , therapy continue without change , unless culture obtain febrile response indicate need antibiotic coverage change . If change antibiotic regimen indicate , antibiotic profile evaluate appropriate antibiotic institute . If occurs , patient 's data continue collect intention treat analysis . In case indication change antibiotic regimen , WBC count drawn patient become remain afebrile complete 24 hour period time . If WBC elevate , antibiotic course continue WBC count draw daily normal value return . If leukocytosis fever persist 10 day , clinical indication postoperative intra-abdominal infection , CT scan abdomen pelvis perform determine postoperative abscess develop . Identification postoperative abscess result percutaneous drainage culture sensitivity abscess fluid . Subsequent antibiotic treatment base sensitivity obtain culture abscess . In case patient â€™ data collect regarded failure antibiotic therapy final analysis . Parental permission child assent , child old enough , obtain ( see attach form ) patient randomize control experimental group base randomization number generate Dr. Steve Simon , PhD . Patient demographic , operative approach , time tolerate full feed , length hospitalization , infectious complication , medication charge , hospital charge collect comparison group .</detailed_description>
