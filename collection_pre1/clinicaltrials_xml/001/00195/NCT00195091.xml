	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm breast malignancy : High risk stage II breast cancer ( â‰¥4 positive lymph node ) , Stage III breast cancer , include inflammatory breast cancer Stage IV breast cancer complete remission ( bone allow unless bone scan normal ) . 2 . The patient must consider standard adjuvant systemic therapy may include chemotherapy , hormonal therapy radiation therapy . They may undergo high dose chemotherapy stem cell support part therapy adjuvant metastatic setting . The patient allow continue take adjuvant hormonal therapy ( high risk adjuvant patient ) may allow hormonal consolidation post transplant without evidence disease transplant metastatic breast cancer . The patient actively receive chemotherapy biologic agent treat breast cancer . 3 . Six week must elapse last chemotherapy radiation therapy . 4 . The patient must definitive surgical therapy breast cancer . This include lumpectomy axillary dissection mastectomy . 5 . No clinical radiologic evidence disease surgery and/or systemic treatment ( CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis bone scan PET scan prior enrollment ) 6 . Because dose adverse event data currently available use TM patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . 7 . ECOG performance status &lt; 1 8 . Life expectancy great 3 month . 9 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : hemoglobin &gt; 10mg/dL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mL platelet &gt; 100,000/mL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal 10 . Erythropoietin alpha allow , indicate . 11 . Bisphosphonates may administer start prior start therapy . 12 . Patients must stable medical therapy least 2 week treat medically peripheral neuropathy . 13 . Concurrent herceptin allow . 14 . The effect TM develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 15 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 6 week prior enter study . 2 . Objective evidence breast cancer . 3 . Carcinomatous meningitis history neoplastic parenchymal brain disease . 4 . Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x normal . 5 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition TM . 6 . Pregnant woman exclude study TM potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother TM , breastfeed discontinue mother treated TM . 7 . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction TM .</criteria>
