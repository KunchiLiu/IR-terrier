	<detailed_description>Background : Obesity inactivity independently increase risk chronic disease adolescence all-cause mortality adulthood . In clinical trial , change exercise diet reduce adiposity risk diabetes chronic disease obese adult youth . In many school system , physical education mandatory elementary school high school , physical activity often decline adolescence . Because physical activity habit track adolescence adulthood , adolescence may represent critical period establish physically active lifestyle prevent disease associate inactivity adulthood . Obesity make adherence aerobic activity challenging , would present less obstacle resistance training . Resistance exercise show favorable effect lean body mass , metabolic rate , insulin resistance , quality life adult , almost research examined effect resistance train obese adolescent . Our survey sample obese , primarily sedentary youth find great overall interest resistance exercise aerobic exercise . Objectives : The primary objective study evaluate effect resistance training , aerobic training , combine aerobic resistance training percent body fat measure use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) sedentary post-pubertal overweight obese youth age 14-18 year . Study Design : Randomized control trial conduct single site . After 4-week supervise low-intensity exercise run-in period test compliance , 292 adolescent BMI ≥ 85th percentile age gender randomize equal number one 4 arm : Diet + aerobic exercise , diet + resistance exercise , diet + combine aerobic resistance exercise , diet-only control . The intervention last 22 week , follow-up assessment 6-months post-treatment ( 11-months post-randomization ) . Hypotheses : Reduction percent body fat large diet + aerobic exercise diet + resistance exercise diet-only control post-treatment , combine aerobic resistance training superior either aerobic resistance train alone reduce percent body fat post-treatment . The combined resistance aerobic group show great improvement percent body fat , body composition , physiological psychosocial function post-treatment 12-months follow-up . Groups include resistance training produce great psychosocial change good adherence aerobic train alone post-treatment follow-up . Significance : The global burden obesity youth increase , effective intervention need . This study may identify resistance training important component treatment overweight adolescent . As , finding may influence clinical decision make management juvenile obesity , well inform public health exercise guideline school-based physical education curriculum attempt reduce economic , medical , psychosocial burden obesity youth .</detailed_description>
