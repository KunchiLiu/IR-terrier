	<brief_summary>This study measure effect cinacalcet ( Sensipar ) parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) secretion child adolescent hypophosphatemic rickets ( XLH ) . The investigator seek evidence patient XLH may benefit treatment cinacalcet achieve good control PTH secretion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Cinacalcet Parathyroid Hormone Secretion Children Adolescents With Hypophosphatemic Rickets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets ( XLH ) X-linked dominant genetic disorder . Common finding low serum phosphate inadequate 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D production . It generally believe primary defect XLH impair renal tubular transport phosphate couple abnormal regulation enzyme responsible 1-alfa hydroxylation 25 ( OH ) vitamin D. The current treatment child XLH large oral dos phosphate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. There two common side effect treatment ; nephrocalcinosis secondary hyperparathyroidism ( HPT ) . The latter time may cause hypertension , hypercalcemia , permanent renal damage . The complication secondary hyperparathyroidism see 20 % patient . The release PTH glands circulation tightly regulate serum calcium concentration . The gland `` read '' serum calcium concentration via Ca sense receptor ( CaR ) locate surface gland . Calcimimetics compound allosterically modulate CaR , thereby enhance sensitivity circulate serum calcium concentration consequently decrease PTH secretion . When used primary HPT , rapidly reduce PTH level normalize serum calcium concentration . Cinacalcet calcimimetic agent recently approve FDA treat hypercalcemia patient parathyroid carcinoma secondary HPT patient chronic renal disease . Cinacalcet find effective decreasing PTH level calcium X phosphorous ion product dialysis patient . The goal propose acute study see whether concomitant administration Cinacalcet phosphate , patient XLH , block completely partially secretion PTH ( day 2 ) , expect see follow administration phosphate alone ( day 1 ) . We also monitor serum phosphate , total calcium , ionized calcium concentration learn extent , , blockage PTH secretion affect mineral homeostasis condition . If find effective block PTH secretion , Cinacalcet become candidate long-term study child XLH protect develop secondary hyperparathyroidism .</detailed_description>
