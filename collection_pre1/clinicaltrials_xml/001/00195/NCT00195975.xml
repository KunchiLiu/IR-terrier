	<detailed_description>Chronic recurrent abdominal pain child common complaint child adolescent , often associate presence functional gastrointestinal disorder ( FGID ) . It likely clinical symptom FGIDs result interaction biologic , psychologic , social factor . The psychologic factor implicate chronic stress anxiety . Stress may influence gastrointestinal function symptom alter balance autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) . Imbalance ANS potential effect gastrointestinal mechanosensitivity , motor function ( e.g . stomach empty accommodation ) , electrical rhythm . All associate abdominal pain . Theory early evidence study do healthy adult population suggest ANS imbalance reduce body 's ability respond electrically food/water consumption . However , relationship chronic stress/anxiety , ANS balance/imbalance , electrical activity stomach eating/drinking remain fully explore child FGIDs . The current study two-part pilot study design assess relationship . Part I involve assessment anxiety/stress ( i.e. , BASC parent- self-reports ) along ANS balance ( i.e. , heart rate variability ) electrical activity stomach ( i.e. , electrogastrography ) measure fast state follow test meal . Part II involve assessment rapid water load replace test meal . Results analyze specific FGID , well group whole . We expect enroll 75 child age 8-17 part , include 30 healthy control 45 child FGID . Elucidating relationship necessary first step develop effective treatment child recurrent abdominal pain , ultimately , reduce personal societal cost common pain entity .</detailed_description>
