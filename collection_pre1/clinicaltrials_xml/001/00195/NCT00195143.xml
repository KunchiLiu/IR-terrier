	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety use modify virus transfer gene call GAD region brain call subthalamic nucleus patient advance Parkinson 's disease . The overall goal approach ultimately normalize flow information several brain region responsible movement , ultimately improve function patient disorder . The current study primarily design evaluate safety approach , patient also monitor possible sign effectiveness well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Subthalamic Nucleus Gene Therapy Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve treatment patient medically refractory Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) gene therapy . The patient choose population patient would normally candidate standard deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery PD . These patient respond medical therapy , develop substantially reduce response time , often severe fluctuation condition functional severely non-functional state . Some patient also develop dose-limiting side effect medication , include involuntary movement call dyskinesia nightmare . When medical contraindication , DBS often perform patient try quiet hyperactive brain region subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) . In PD , STN overactive due loss GABA input region , normally reduce neuronal firing . In turn , STN drive brain region , include globus pallidus ( GPi ) substantia nigra ( SNr ) , also hyperactive also reduce GABA input . The goal gene therapy trial introduce gene glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD ) STN use adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) vector , order permit STN produce 's GABA , well release GABA GPi SNr target , also reduce GABA input . This anticipated restore normal pattern information flow basal ganglia circuit thalamus high cortical structure order reduce motor symptom PD , eliminate complication arise insert DBS electrodes battery human body .</detailed_description>
