	<detailed_description>d. STATUS : Background Significance/Preliminary Studies Neovascularization obligate early event cancer growth . Consequently , angiogenesis appear play important role disease progression survival malignancy general gynecologic malignancy specifically . Ovarian cancer second common gynecologic malignancy , lead cause cancer relate death among gynecologic malignancy . It estimate 23,300 new case ovarian cancer diagnose United States 2003 13,900 woman die disease . Angiogenesis may serve prognostic indicator ovarian cancer . Angiogenesis cancer require proliferation migration endothelial cell response variety cytokine include angiogenin , endothelial cell growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . The expression cytokine evaluate gynecologic malignancy . Increased expression VEGF protein immunohistochemistry associate decreased disease free survival 18 versus 120 month early stage epithelial ovarian cancer . Conversely exposure antiangiogenic factor inhibit tumor cell growth vitro . Angiostatin endostatin also find inhibit ovarian cancer growth mice 7 . The neovascularization require fast grow malignancy general , ovarian cancer specifically , necessitates contain many new vessel less smooth muscle wall . Because quantitative decrease vascular smooth muscle vessel also decrease resistance blood flow vessel find benign tumor . Malignant tumor low vascular resistance show demonstrate decrease smooth muscle actin expression intense Cd34 expression difference microvessel density ( MVD ) note 8 . Immunohistochemical analysis use monoclonal antibody smooth muscle actin ( SMA ) CD34 ( endothelial cell marker ) demonstrate low resistance blood flow vessel within malignant ovarian tumor may associate poorly develop muscular coat tumor vessel , compare observe benign tumor . Color-flow Doppler imaging us alter blood flow pattern marker attempt differentiate benign malignant tumor 9 . Researchers evaluate presence intratumoral vascularization ovarian neoplasms Color-flow Doppler ultrasound . Benign tumor cysts significantly high pulsatility index ( PI ) ( mean , 1.93 +/- 1.02 ; range , 0.23-3.99 ) resistive index ( RI ) ( mean , 0.77 +/- 0.22 ; range , 0.2-1.0 ) malignant tumor ( PI : mean , 0.77 +/- 0.33 ; range , 0.31-1.09 ; RI : mean , 0.5 +/- 0.17 ; range , 0.27-0.67 ) . Some overlap , however , exist individual value benign malignant lesion . The difference angiogenic vascular resistant nature benign malignant ovarian tumor show intratumoral blood flow may thus correlate endothelial cell activity tumor vessel MVD . This low resistance blood flow within tumor vessel subsequent endothelial cell activity could regulate local , endothelial cell vascular smooth muscle cell , arginine-vasopressin ( AVP ) synthesis release subsequent action vasopressin receptor . Arginine-vasopressin ( AVP ) peptide hormone classically know synthesized hypothalamus secrete posterior pituitary gland . AVP variety role body variety systemic physiologic function include vasoconstriction , gluconeogenesis , corticosteroidogenesis , excretion water urea . AVP cause peripheral vasoconstriction think mediate primarily V1 receptor . AVP think variety mechanism include activation V1a receptor stimulation phospholipase A2 lead increase calcium spiking activity . AVP could also regulate expression hypertensive factor proteins body . AVP show play important role development hypertension follow aortic constriction rat . When rat give AVP follow constriction abdominal aorta , hypertension develop animal increase response angiotensin II . Therefore AVP think permit expression factor angiotensin II . The presence AVP important animal model hypertension spontaneously hypertensive rat DOCA salt hypertension . For instance , administration DOCA salt Brattleboro rat , genetically incapable synthesize vasopressin hypothalamus , result development hypertension . However , administration exogenous AVP , rat develop hypertension give DOCA salt treatment . Exposure vascular smooth muscle cell AVP also increase smooth muscle actin activation three MAP kinase family pathway . Because AVP ability regulate increase smooth muscle actin suggest AVP may regulate growth vascular smooth muscle also promote expression smooth muscle-specific contractile protein . Previous study show AVP produce exaggerated vascular vasoconstriction young spontaneously hypertensive rat ( SHR ) relative normotensive rat . This exaggerated response likely associate high density V1 receptor associate increase AVP gene expression . Finally AVP neuropepetides show serve autocrine growth factor solid tumor . The mitogenic influence AVP think involve increase intracellular calcium . AVP often express small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) , act autocrine growth factor cancer . AVP expression SCLC think dependent modulation normal repressor activity 12 . Because AVP implicate physiology vascular constriction mean vascular pressure , also show express certain type cancer , may also role angiogenic factor intratumoral vascularization ovarian cancer carcinogenesis . It purpose propose study investigate relationship AVP expression vascular receptor ovarian neoplasm histology . Preliminary result : Recently , lab isolate analyzed human mesenteric artery VP mRNA V1 receptor mRNA analysis . V1R mRNA strongly positively correlate diastolic blood pressure ( r = 0.70 , p = 0.0112 ) . V1R mRNA tend great male female ( 5.73 + 1.29 compare 2.3 + 0.94 relative expression unit V1R mRNA , p = 0.057 ) . Also , arterial AVP mRNA correlate negatively age ( p=0.0028 ) . These result suggest alteration VP V1R expression could involve disease state ovarian cancer blood pressure flow well age may factor development malignancy tumor . The AVP peptide measure radioimmunoassay blood vessels23 , e.g . radial mammary artery saphenous vein sample , immunoactivity show co-migrate synthetic AVP HPLC analysis . The level hormone range undetectable high 60 uU/gr tissue . Thus , also able verify change VP gene expression measure AVP protein directly ovarian neoplasm blood vessel collect . 6 . PLAN : Women , 18 year old great , ovary remove enrol protocol . 110 total specimen obtain . At institution approximately 200 patient per year ovary remove . All patient gynecologic tissue remove benign ( non cancerous ) malignant ( cancerous ) indication meet inclusion criterion . Patients malignancy primary gynecologic malignancy exclude study . Each patient 's intratumoral vascularity assess Doppler ultrasound systemic blood pressure measure preoperatively .

Laboratory Methods : Vasopressin synthesis ( indicated VP mRNA ) vasopressin receptor ( V1R V2R ) regulation ( indicated V1R mRNA V2R mRNA level ) assess . Measurement V2R addition V1R mRNA help clarify whether possible change V1R expression ovarian neoplasm specific receptor subtype . Ovarian artery sample isolate store RNA later TM ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) -70oC extract RNA commercial kit ( Invitrogen Carlsbad , CA ) . VP mRNA , V1R mRNA , beta actin mRNA quantify quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR ) use iCycler ( BioRad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) .
