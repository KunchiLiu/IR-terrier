	<brief_summary>Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) rare disorder curable allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . A mismatched family member option human leukocyte antigen ( HLA-immune system type ) match related matched unrelated donor available . This study evaluate novel therapeutic strategy patient WAS undergo haploidentical transplantation use parental donor . To reduce risk transplant-related toxicity , participant receive reduce intensity chemotherapy antibody regimen ( condition treatment ) . Participants receive infusion donor stem cell deplete certain white blood cell call T- B-lymphocytes . The stem cell depletion process do use investigational CliniMACS device . A certain number T-lymphocytes add back processed stem cell graft prior infusion recipient . The primary objective study determine safety haploidentical transplantation WAS patient use specified condition regimen engineer graft . Safety define term engraftment ( mean well graft grows function infusion ) regimen-related toxicity within first 100 day transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary Objectives trial include follow : - To estimate survival study recipient one year infusion T- B-lymphocyte deplete stem cell graft . - To assess study treatment enable recipient generate normal donor-derived B-cell number endogenous IgM , IgG , IgA production , result reduction/elimination need intravenous immunoglobulin infusion . - To determine study treatment result ability research participant generate normal donor-derived T cell response natural killer ( NK ) cell number function . - To describe incidence Epstein-Barr virus-lymphoproliferative disease ( EBV-LPD ) transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
