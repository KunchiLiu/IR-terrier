	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer commonly diagnose tumor among men United States . Most patient tumor confine prostate gland diagnosis suitable treatment surgery radiotherapy ( RT ) aim cure disease . Nevertheless , despite recent improvement treatment , large number men continue die prostate cancer . These patient often spread tumor area body , treat hormone produce initial tumor shrinkage . However , time tumor learns grow despite continued hormonal treatment . Effective therapy patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer lack patient often deteriorate quickly die . Thus , need good treatment cure prostate cancer early stage , good understand biology prostate cancer specifically respect factor determine effectiveness RT , spread tumor development hormone-resistant disease . Low level oxygen ( hypoxia ) know exist many human tumor , study show hypoxic tumor less likely cured RT . In addition , hypoxia may lead low cure rate follow surgery , spread cancer area body , change genetic characteristic cancer cell cause behave aggressively . The importance hypoxia prostate cancer previously evaluate . The aim study determine often hypoxia occurs early prostate cancer whether hypoxia influence success RT , tumor spread beyond prostate bone organ development hormone-resistant disease . Patients tumor oxygen level measure use special fine-needle electrode system prior begin treatment either RT combination hormone plus RT . The measurement make rectum use ultrasound position guide electrode . A biopsy tumor obtain site measurement , use determine oxygen influence change genetic character prostate cancer cell . A total 195 patient evaluated way 3 year . This study provide unique information behavior prostate cancer , may help explain currently available treatment include surgery , RT hormones fail cure patient . Assuming study show hypoxia important prostate cancer , future work focus new anti-hypoxia treatment use combination surgery RT aim overcome obstacle improve cure rate .</brief_summary>
