	<brief_title>Differential Gene Expression Liver Tissue Blood From Individuals With Chronic Viral Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study identify gene specifically regulate chronic viral hepatitis autoimmune liver disease examine expression pattern relate ( ) clinical outcome . The expression pattern thousand gene provide extremely powerful statistical tool distinguish different pathophysiological state . It well recognize neither hepatitis B hepatitis C directly cytotoxic , effect appear mediate via immune response . Similarly individual autoimmune liver disease e.g . primary biliary cirrhosis ( PBC ) , primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) autoimmune hepatitis ( AIH ) immune mediate mechanism appear cause liver disease although elicit antigen ( ) remain unknown . The pattern gene expression give clue cause pathogenesis disease . For instance , disease cause infection , specific cytokine response observe different infection viral bacterial parasitic . It also possible certain pattern response would elicit disease cause response xenobiotic . In patient autoimmune liver disease , possible endogenous and/or exogenous antigen initiate disease subsequent autoimmune response . Finally , also possible completely unexpected series cellular event responsible pathogenesis , microarray experiment enable u discover process . HCV - The molecular genetics hepatitis C viral infection HCV molecular biology : HCV positive-stranded RNA Flaviviridae virus 9.6kB genome . The genome encodes polyprotein approximately 3000 amino acid subsequently cleave host virus-specific protease yield 4 structural 6 nonstructural polypeptide . The 4 functional protein include metalloproteinase ( NS5A ) , serine protease ( NS3/NS4A ) , RNA helicase ( NS3 ) , RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( NS5B ) . Six different genotype HCV describe , genotype 1 prevalent worldwide genotype 4 prevalent Middle East . The various genotype interact differently host immune system , though molecular basis unclear . Chronic infection genotypes 1 4 notoriously resistant treatment IFN , genotypes 2 3 relatively good response . This difference may part due mutation NS5A protein . In cellular model NS5A interact IFN-induced antiviral enzyme 2 ’ 5 ’ OAS . Other HCV protein likely interact cellular protein alter response immune IFN antiviral mechanism : HCV core protein dampen lymphocytic Th1 response influence IRF , Jak/STAT iNOS pathway . Although result suggest virus may alter know cellular pathway , viral evasion immune system multifactorial clearly complex . Research Hypothesis : The process lead persistence acute HCV infection relate , molecular level , drive HCV resistance IFN therapy . Elucidating specific host/viral response context provide novel target small-molecule antiviral therapy apply acute chronicHCV . Progress Report : CIHR 106800 We establish large grow tissue RNA registry study liver disease , perform comprehensive gene array analysis chronic HCV . Some important finding detail . HCV complex progressive disease interaction host virus profound effect . The combination clinical experimental variability seriously confound result gene expression study mandate large number patient sample examine . The fact liver pathology similar among number different disease also necessitate many different patient disease include analysis . Accordingly , analyze large number patient control , maintain careful database clinical detail order perform multivariate analysis gene array data . At present use 19K human microarray determine hepatic gene expression 86 HCV patient compare 24 normal , 20 HBV 14 PBC patient . The array data high quality : rate confirmation real-time PCR exceed 80 % . We examine relative contribution age , sex , viral genotype ( 1 vs 2/3 ) , degree fibrosis disease activity gene upregulated infection HCV.The important determinant consistent gene expression profile HCV infect liver viral genotype ( genotype 1 v others ) . However , within Genotype 1 sample clear difference gene expression . This divergent host-virus interaction reflect subsequent response PegIFN/Rib therapy . All HCV liver biopsy analyze date take patient go treatment PegIFN/Rib . At present , treatment complete 49 patient . In observation may significant clinical utility , show ultimate response treatment ( sustained viral response versus v nonresponder/relapser ) reflect original gene expression profile . We identify 18 gene whose expression level distinguish responder non-responders/relapsers accuracy &gt; 90 % . Based observation file patent protect intellectual property form company commercialize genetic test . The result also submit publication . Taken together believe describe set gene , perhaps biological process , lie heart host-HCV interaction . Section I . A possible role UBP43 , ISG15 Pathway HCV Interferon While gene expression profile distinguish two type chronic HCV infection – one respond IFN , - main objective achieve molecular understand role specific gene proteins host response HCV . Though alter gene expression level directly implicate gene product biological pathway , compel biological reason suggest least gene list play important role viral-IFN response . Several up-regulated gene interferon-sensitive ( include OAS , Mx1 , ISG15 , VIPERIN , IFIT , GIP2 ) . Polymorphisms OAS weakly link self-limited HCV infection , polymorphisms Mx1 weakly link response status . Hepatic mRNA level OAS , Mx1 , GIP2 increase chronic HCV none , alone , link treatment outcome . The gene directly IFN-responsive may play role cellular pathway important IFN response ( PI3AP1 , DUSP1 ) , involved inflammatory cell activation maturation ( LAP ) . ISG15 UBP43/USP18 , components newly-recognized IFN regulatory pathway , perhaps interesting subset gene find differentially express study . Both gene express highly nonresponder ( NR ) compare responder ( R ) liver tissue , suggest might interfere immune response HCV-infected liver ISG15 ubiquitin-like ( Ubl ) protein think important innate immune function covalently link protein follow interferon activation . How link accomplish controversial may involve overlap know E2 Ub enzymes . Interestingly , E2 Ub enzyme UBCH8 recently identify activator ISG15,34 one gene upregulated response chronic HCV microarray analysis . The conjugation ISG15 target protein reverse highly specific protease , USP18/UBP43 . UBP43 belong family Ub-specific protease induce IFN , LPS viral infection ; degrade Skp2 Ub ligase . Loss USP18 mouse lead IFN hypersensitivity . Our data link UBP43 HCV , suggest pathway important divergent host/viral response . Research Objective I . To establish role 18 gene – particular , ISG15 UBP43 - associate divergent host/ virus interaction , use HCV replicon model . Research Protocols Section I : DNA microarray study shed light transcription state cell necessarily link specific gene product biological problem address . Accordingly , important test role individual gene use approach . We use vitro assay viral replication study role gene whose expression find altered HCV infect liver . These straightforward experiment , since HCV difficult virus study . HCV replicate human chimpanzee , poorly isolated human peripheral blood cell , though act extrahepatic viral pool . Subgenomic RNA replicons transfected certain cell line maintain , date genotype successfully translate replicon model ( 1b , 1a , 2a ) . Recently , elegant HCV model describe Edmonton human hepatocytes transplant SCID-beige mouse . This model support HCV infection replication ; however , since bulk HCV effect due immune response generate virus , model exists currently may ideal study virus lead liver damage evades antiviral immune response human . We choose explore role gene interest use full-length HCV genotype 1a replicon assay , collaboration Dr. Charles Rice ( Rockefeller University , New York ) . This replicon variant full-length HCV H77 strain describe recently Dr. Rice , high level replication cell culture previous version . The replicon model ideal rapidly test effect many gene use extensively study HCV mechanism cellular level . This approach use gene identify potential interest study , focus first ISG15 UBP43 gene , second 16 gene remain response-discriminatory list , finally novel gene identify gene expression study detail . Ia . Effect siRNA knockdown upregulation ( transfection ) individual gene , include UBP43 ISG15 , HCV replicon Huh7.5 cell . We use RNA interference ( RNAi ) `` knock '' specific gene order evaluate roles viral replication . Small double-stranded RNA molecule use induce sequence-specific degradation homologous single-stranded RNA . For study stock Huh7.5 cell compare Huh7.5 cell stably express full-length Genotype 1a HCV replicon develop Dr. Charles Rice ’ laboratory . The methodology detailed routine laboratory laboratory collaborator . Control study : Baseline gene protein expression , effect IFN , effect replicon : The replicon system use test effect give gene viral replication , also effect IFN response . Previous study demonstrate HCV 1b genotype RNA replication sensitive IFN-a treatment , even low dos . In fact , roles two gene list eighteen , MxA GIP3/IFI6-16 , already examine . The IFN inhibition HCV 1b replicon RNA replication independent MxA , transient transfection GIP3 inhibit 1b replicon enhance effect IFNa . We study role remain gene list use HCV genotype 1a replicon . The study describe outline approach ISG15 UBP43 gene ; however , similar strategy employ gene interest . Huh7.5 cell HCV replicon cell incubate 12 hour increase dos IFNa2b ( 0 , 1,10 100U/ml ) , IFNb ( 0,10,100 1000 U/ml ) , IFNg ( 0,10,100 1000 U/ml ) , ISG 15 , UBP43 , HCV mRNA level determine real-time PCR . ISG15 protein level determine western blot ( mAb kind gift Dr. E.C . Borden , Scripps Institute ) ; UBP43 western study perform create antibody antibody become available ( currently develop lab Dr. D.E . Zhang , Scripps Institute ) . RNA isolation perform standard Trizol extraction , protein extraction lysing cell RIPA buffer . These study establish mRNA protein level ISG15 UBP43 baseline , response IFN , replicon replicon/IFN . One important issue confirm gene protein-of-interest expressed cell prior knock-down experiment . In preliminary study determine baseline expression ISG15 UBP43 mRNA Huh7.5 replicon cell ( real-time PCR ) IFNa strongly induce protein expression ISG15 Huh7.5 cell . These result argue ISG15 UBP43 pathway relevant model . siRNA study : We hypothesize elimination UBP43 lead less HCV RNA replication baseline magnify effect IFN , elimination ISG15 increase baseline HCV RNA decrease effect IFN . Silencing control siRNAs obtain Ambion . These transfected use GenePorter accord manufacturer ’ instruction ; transfection condition optimize use SV40 promoter/enhancer luciferase control plasmid , pGL2-control , ensure increase amount templates result proportional increase luciferase activity . Forty-eight hour transfection , total RNA protein sample prepare . Real-time PCR perform determine mRNA expression presence absence siRNA , protein level determine Western blot . After control study perform , effect siRNA inhibition baseline IFN-treated HCV RNA replication test . Transfection study : We hypothesize upregulation UBP43 increase vitro HCV RNA replication baseline decrease effect IFN , upregulation ISG15 decrease baseline HCV RNA increase effect IFN . UBP43 expression upregulated use UBP43 expression plasmid pcDNA6-UBP43 ; ISG15 expression plasmid obtain subcloning ISG15 gene pcDNA6 vector . As , HCV RNA level determine presence absence IFNa use real-time PCR . Taken together study define role gene suggest play important role distinction clinical PegIFN/Rib treatment responder nonresponders . Ib . Mechanism action ISG15/UBP43 pathway : If determine ISG15 UBP43 play role HCV RNA replication genotype 1 replicon model examine effect mediate . We determine whether effect UBP43 dependent protease function association another cellular protein . We also identify ISG15 protein target might mediate effect . Role UBP43 protease activity : If elimination UBP43 show reduce viral replication magnify interferon response , hypothesize inhibition UBP43 represent novel mean treatment HCV . UBP43 would particular interest protease activity : protease know validated target small molecule therapy . Thus , would critical establish whether protease activity UBP43 important effect HCV replication , , instance , interaction another cellular protein . To address question over-express UBP43 protease inactive construct . An inactive form UBP43 create mutation critical cysteine residue ( Cys61 ) serine use site-directed mutagenesis pBK/CMV-UBP43 plasmid describe previously . In order characterize protease active inactive form UBP43 , wild type mutant UBP43 express GST fusion proteins expression vector pGEX-4T-3 ( pGEX-4T-3-UBP43 ) , transform E.Coli BL21 ( DE3 ) plasmid , pET-ISG15-UBP43-H , express ISG15-UBP43 fusion protein.35 ISG15 cleavage fusion protein show Western blot . Once confirmed protease function eliminate site-directed mutagenesis , wild-type mutate UBP43 overexpressed Huh7.5 cell HCV replicon expose increase dos IFNa . If protease function critical overexpression inactive ( dominant negative fashion ) increase responsiveness IFN . Protein target ISG15 : Previous work use thymic tissue identify several target ISGylation ISG15 , include phospholipase Cg1 , Jak1 , ERK1 . Whether target Huh7.5 cell know , though ERK JAK previously link antiviral effect HCV replicon model . If find ISG15 implicate HCV replication , would seek identify substrate ISG15 modification . We first perform series immunoprecipitation study direct specifically proteins previously show find modify ISG15 , explore difference infect uninfected cell . In brief , follow incubation Huh7.5 cell +/- replicon IFNa 12 hour , cell lysed RIPA buffer immunoprecipitation ISG15 conjugate perform anti-ISG15 mAb use . After resolution reduce gel , western blot perform determine three target conjugate ISG15 , use commercially-available mAbs . If target conjugate , study perform elucidate consequence ISGylation . To fully explore protein modify ISG15 cell culture , undertake comprehensive screen use mass-spectroscopy – apply strategy previously use identify target ubiquitin-like SUMO protein . TAP-tagging approach couple MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry use . We transfect cell TAP-tagged SPA-tagged ISG15 purify protein protein complex cell treat untreated IFN . Using established procedure , purify identify substrate use gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry . Gel slice contain protein reductively alkylated subjected trypsinolysis . The peptide purify analyzed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry use cyano-4-hydroxycin-namic acid matrix Voyager DE-STR instrument ( Applied Biosystems ) . Identification proteins use mass fingerprint data carry use ProFound software . Since MS use quantify protein amount , identify protein interest comparing list protein ISGylated various condition perform Western blot study compare protein amount . In experiment use MS equipment expertise readily available Best Institute . Conclusions I : Taken together study clearly define role ISG15 UBP43 pathway HCV replicon response IFN , suggest effect mediate . Importantly , methodology describe , though detailed ISG15 UBP43 , generic apply candidate gene interest . Section II : Gene Expression Profiling Acute Hepatitis C Viral Infection : There similarity pathway identify important chronic disease may important acute infection . For example , polymorphisms 2 ’ 5 ’ OAS – gene find list – alter risk progress acute chronic infection.20 Therefore hypothesize set gene likely play important role determine failure clear acute infection . We test hypothesis use microarray analysis . We plan examine role gene acute HCV infection systemic local host/virus interaction . Acutely-infected liver tissue difficult obtain acute HCV infection identify , inappropriate perform liver biopsy case . Thus use two different approach . First , study gene expression pattern peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) collect Egyptian health care worker acute HCV ( provide Dr. Sanaa Kamal ) compare PBMCs patient genotype-matched chronic HCV healthy volunteer . We develop predictive model test gene subset associate clinical outcome establishment chronic infection . Second , use recurrence HCV post transplantation model acute hepatitis vivo . We take biopsy donor liver PRIOR transplantation follow gene expression level time virus infects graft . After transplantation HCV-naïve liver rapidly universally becomes infected HCV , though 70 % patient develop histological evidence recurrence liver biopsy take 3 and/or 6 month post-transplant . It patient currently treat recurrent HCV use PegIFN/Rib . As , develop predictive model associate gene subset clinical outcome . We achieve 60 % response rate encouraging treatment adherence despite even grueling side effect transplantation . Thus , treatment HCV prior transplantation significant fraction patient respond therapy needlessly expose morbid side effect : key clinical outcome consider response therapy PegIFN/Rib . Another outcome interest rapid development cirrhosis within 5 year 25-30 % patient , development aggressive fibrosing cholestatic state 7-9 % within 2 year transplant . Together data point gene important immunological response result disease persistence elimination ( acute HCV health care worker ) progression liver disease ( post-transplantation patient ) . Highly up- down-regulated gene study HCV replicon model . Research Objective 2 . To determine gene expression profile highly associate clinical outcome acute hepatitis , circulate immune cell liver . Research Protocols Section II : We propose three major analysis . First , perform gene expression profile PBMC preparation provide Dr. Kamal patient acute HCV . These PBMC preparation perform part ongoing study head Dr. Kamal . Second , use microarray analysis describe hepatic gene alter HCV infection post-transplant liver graft response infection HCV . For use portion liver biopsy already take part routine post-transplant clinical care . Third , prepare PBMCs patient chronic HCV determine gene expression profile . Not critical comparison acute HCV , also act basis predict outcomes treatment chronic HCV . IIa . Patient recruitment , study population collection sample data : In case , patient identify clinical staff potential candidate study approach study nurse . Consent obtain research use tissue blood sample , collection patient clinical data . Acute HCV : systemic PBMC response Dr. Kamal follow population Egyptian health care worker become infected acutely HCV , routinely isolate PBMCs . This clinical population compose primarily Genotype 1 Genotype 4 infected individual , thoroughly describe patient demographic , RNA titer time blood collection , progression chronic infection . Given relative rarity Genotype 4 local population initial analysis focus Genotype 1 acute HCV , intend study genotype 4 well , since genotype great relevance HCV worldwide . Based previous work anticipate need 10-20 patient give group order clearly define consistent gene expression change across spectrum clinical variability . We expect collect study PBMC sample least 20 acute genotype 1 patient per year . Samples 20 healthy control volunteer also obtain 3 year study period ( recruited poster ) . Acute HCV : Hepatic response HCV recurrence post-transplantation Our center perform 30-40 liver transplant year person infect HCV . All clinical data liver transplant population enter Oracle-based database . Liver biopsies routinely take HCV-naïve graft prior transplantation 12 , 24 , 52 week post-transplantation . Based previous experience expect accrual rate least 80 % ; thus , able collect data specimens roughly 24-32 patient per year . Biopsies normal liver take part ongoing study live donor population ( PI : I. McGilvray ) . 30-40 biopsy take every year represent unique source control liver tissue . Chronic HCV : systemic PBMC response Dr. Heathcote follow large population patient chronic HCV . Blood sample take patient treatment PegIFN/Rib consider PBMCs isolate . Based experience liver biopsy study outline Progress Report , expect obtain PBMC preparation least 50 patient year . Roughly 2/3 Genotype 1 patient . IIb . Data Analysis : Acute HCV : Gene expression change response acute HCV circulate PBMCs Gene expression profile PBMCs patient acute Genotype 1 HCV determine compare normal healthy control chronic genotype 1 HCV . Genes identify statistical fold difference group ( p value &lt; 0.01 , fold change least 1.5 ) . This comparison define gene expression alteration specific acute HCV infection . In order associate individual gene progression chronic disease , subgroup analyse do gene expression acutely infected individual compare go chronic infection spontaneously eliminate virus . After real-time PCR confirmation gene use number unsupervised ( hierarchical clustering , principal component ) supervise ( near neighbours , linear discriminants ) analyse develop predictive gene set accurately classify patient go develop chronic infection . Taken together result identify gene whose expression alter systemic immunologic response acute HCV relate establishment chronic disease . Genes interest possible therapeutic target study use HCV replicon model , describe earlier . By end second year study expect analyze 40 acute genotype 1 patient , third year analyze 20 genotype 4 patient . Acute HCV : local hepatic gene expression post-transplantation HCV infection Gene expression profile determine liver biopsy organ retrieval , prior infection HCV , 3 , 6 12 month transplantation . Gene change therefore follow patient patient ; gene level compare normal liver tissue baseline gene expression HCV-naïve graft , use statistical method develop lab EBI . Currently 70 % patient transplant HCV center treat recurrent HCV post-transplantation evidence recurrent HCV liver biopsy , patient quantitative HCV titer do 3 6 month post-transplantation . Roughly 80 % patient complete therapy 12 month course . Thus , end 3 year study know response treatment 28-36 patient ( expect 60 % response rate , thus roughly 17-22 responder 11-14 nonresponders ) , eventually data 42-54 patient expect complete therapy . With sample size determine gene subset predictive response treatment ( use method note ) . Equally able relate gene expression HCV RNA titer 50-60 patient . By end three year study clinical genomic data 72 90 patient . Ultimately relate gene expression development recurrent cirrhosis , anticipate roughly 18-30 patient go state within 5 year transplantation . In order control effect many confound factor could influence hepatic gene expression post-transplantation ( eg . acute rejection , immunosuppression ) perform subgroup analyse use extensive clinical database . We compare HCV treatment responder nonresponders , rejection rejection , different immunosuppressive regimen , addition compare gene expression profile acute hepatic HCV already determine chronic HCV . These analysis allow u distinguish describe effect acute HCV infection hepatic gene expression . Chronic HCV : circulate PBMC response prediction treatment outcome : Over first 2 year study use gene expression profile study PBMCs roughly 30 patient chronic genotype 1 HCV . This data serve crucial control study acute HCV PBMCs . However , sample take patient go treatment PegIFN/Rib . Therefore use gene expression data study comparison acutely infect PBMCs , also determine gene subset predictive treatment outcome . These result form basis noninvasive prognostic test . Conclusions II : These study provide comprehensive description gene expression change accompany acute HCV infection systemic local level . They clearly identify gene important progression chronic disease adverse clinical outcome , thereby suggest novel prognostic therapeutic target .</detailed_description>
