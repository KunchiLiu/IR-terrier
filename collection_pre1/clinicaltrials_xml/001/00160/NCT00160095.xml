	<detailed_description>Purpose Prognostic indicator discriminate patient good bad prognosis . Predictive assay tool select patient specific treatment treatment modification outcome improved relative conventional treatment . In oncology , many prognostic indicator base clinical biological tumor characteristic describe proven useful predictive assay . We develop image modality coregistration tumor oxygenation proliferation microregional level preservation tumor anatomy microenvironmental structure . We strong indication functional image powerful tool identifying patient profit hypoxia modifying treatment . Tumor oxygenation proliferation recognize important determinant outcome radiotherapy possibly also treatment modality number tumor type particular squamous cell carcinoma . Various exogenous endogenous marker hypoxia proliferation currently available study relation , tumor architecture tumor microenvironment use immunohistochemistry advance image analysis technique . The purpose project identify microregional profile oxygenation proliferation base exogenous endogenous marker : 1 . Are predictive outcome radiotherapy squamous cell carcinoma larynx . 2 . Can identify patient likely benefit hypoxia modify treatment strategy . And : 3 . Validate marker profile prospective manner sufficiently large group patient . Plan investigation In 2001 multicenter randomize trial initiate compare accelerate radiotherapy carbogen nicotinamide hypoxic modifier accelerate radiotherapy alone patient carcinoma larynx . This trial approve supported Dutch Cancer Society currently 6 Dutch 1 British center participate . This trial provide unique opportunity prospectively test oxygenation proliferation relate marker profile large homogeneous patient population assess predictive capacity comparative set one group patient receive hypoxia modify treatment group . Paraffin-embedded biopsy specimen collect patient entered trial . In part patient , biopsy take injection hypoxic marker pimonidazole S-phase marker iododeoxyuridine ( IdUrd ) . Sections immunohistochemically process stain various combination vascular marker , endogenous hypoxia proliferation marker , applicable , pimonidazole IdUrd . The section analyze computerized image processing . Apart overall single parameter value obtain , interrelationship various parameter study microregional phenotype tumor characterize quantification integration marker profile . The information thus obtain related treatment outcome term local control survival result two treatment group compare . Possible result This investigation identify oxygenation proliferation relate parameter profile predictive outcome radiotherapy squamous cell carcinoma larynx provide selection tool hypoxia modify treatment . The principle characterization tumor phenotype microregional level use functional imaging may also apply tumor type treatment strategy .</detailed_description>
