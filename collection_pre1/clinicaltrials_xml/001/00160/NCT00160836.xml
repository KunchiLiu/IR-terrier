	<brief_summary>Introduction In patient biliary obstruction , tissue acquire immediately drainage endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography ( ERCP ) . This perform pass brush inside bile duct stricture . However , brush cytology modest sensitivity ( 30-57 % ) diagnosis cancer . A device , call `` G.I.U.M . '' catheter , allow sample high amount tissue ERCP compare brush cytology . The aim study compare diagnostic yield tissue sample perform patient suspect malignant biliary stricture use 2 technique , namely standard brush catheter G.I.U.M.. Protocol design Eligible patient tissue sample perform use technique ERCP , first technique use randomly assign immediately follow one well biliary decompression . All specimen obtain subjected cytopathological examination . After inclusion total number patient , smear anonymized analyzed diagnosis , cell cellularity quality . The final clinical diagnosis case base cytologic result plus histological examination biopsy specimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Many patient suspect malignant biliary obstruction consider unsuitable surgery locally advance metastatic disease poor clinical performance status . Management patient facilitate tissue diagnosis initial endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography ( ERCP ) . This may obviate invasive test , suitable nonsurgical treatment initiate without delay . Brush cytology frequently use technique . The procedure relatively easy perform , require little time , generally safe . Although specificity close 100 % , brush cytology modest sensitivity range 30 % 57 % publish study . A device , call `` G.I.U.M . '' catheter develop increase amount tissue available analysis 1 . It consist basket multiple wire pass stricture , grasp tissue wire . It show uncontrolled study allow diagnosis malignancy high sensitivity ( Endoscopy , submit publication ) . The aim study compare diagnostic yield tissue sample perform use standard brush catheter G.I.U.M . patient suspect malignant biliary stricture . Selection patient Inclusion criterion : - Suspicion malignant biliary stricture without prior histopathologic confirmation ; - Informed consent ERCP , include sample dilation modality , obtain . Exclusion criterion : - Coagulopathy correct administration vitamin K fresh frozen plasma ; - Inability pas guidewire stricture ; - Hilar stricture . Protocol design management policy Eligible patient tissue sample perform use technique , first technique use randomly assign immediately follow one . Randomization perform open opaque seal envelope number accord table random number block 6 patient ; center receive pack 24 numbered envelope ( make investigation nurse ) . A listing patient biliary stricture diagnose ERCP maintain ( name , surname , date birth , date examination ) , reason non inclusion state . Methods tissue sample Antibiotics administer intravenously 30 minute ERCP . ERCP biliary decompression perform standard technique . 2 After bile duct cannulation , iopromide ( Ultravist , 300mgI/mL , Berlex , Montville , N.J. ) inject , level length biliary stricture determine . A guidewire pass stricture intrahepatic opacification complete . A biliary sphincterotomy perform use standard sphincterotome , facilitate placement stent naso-biliary drain . Pancreatography possibly attempt , especially pancreatic disease suspect . Tissue sample perform order assign randomization , accord follow technique : - Brush : RX-cytology brush ( M00545000 , Boston Scientific Corp. , Natick , Mass . ) pass unit within 8 French sheath , guidewire stricture . Previous stricture dilation leave discretion endoscopist . The brush/sheath withdrawn immediately stricture , brush move forth back within strictured segment least 10 time . The brush pull catheter , still locate immediately stricture , unit brush/catheter remove . A X-ray take top brush inside stricture , X-ray kept dedicate file , well X-ray stricture opacified contrast medium . Specimens obtain brush smear glass slide fix 95 % ethanol immediately collection , ERCP suite . Immediately , brush agitate 10 ml saline place vial . Finally , brush segment cut supportive wire place container CytoLytt solution ( Cytyc , Crawley , United Kingdom ) . - G.I.U.M . : immediately use G.I.U.M . catheter , biliary stricture dilate use 6-mm diameter MaxForce balloon catheter ( Microvasive Endoscopy , Boston Sc. ) . The G.I.U.M . catheter pass unit within 8.5F sheath , alongside guidewire . Once basket/sheath locate stricture , basket open pass strictured segment 1 time . The basket pull catheter , unit basket/catheter removed.. A X-ray take mesh G.I.U.M . catheter open inside stricture , X-ray kept dedicate file . Specimens obtain G.I.U.M . smear glass slide fix 95 % ethanol immediately collection , ERCP suite . Immediately , G.I.U.M . agitate 10 ml saline place vial . Finally , material remain wire G.I.U.M . rinse sheath vial perfuse 30 ml CytoLytt solution ( Cytyc ) take vial furnished manufacturer use 20-ml sterile syringe vial . Smears well 2 vial saline 2 vial CytoLytt label patient 's name mark `` G.I.U.M . '' `` brush '' . Complications possibly detect ERCP 30 follow day note assessed use establish consensus criterion . 3 Preparation tissue sample Cytolytt vial : specimen Cytolytt prepare accord ThinPrep processor operator manual ( http : //www.thinprep.com/85506Prd/gencyt.htm ) . Specimens obtain ThinPrep technique process 1 slide describe manufacturer . Cell block inclusion perform whenever possible . Smears : specimen stain Papanicolaou technique standard cytologic examination . Cytopathological examination After inclusion total number patient , label mark smear remove replaced random number . Two non-consecutive random number 1 1000 select patient , one smear obtain G.I.U.M. , smear obtain brush JMD . Smears re-read two cytopathologists blind name patient , technique tissue sampling , previous diagnosis , well relationship 2 random number pair sample collect patient ( avoid interpretation sample obtain use one 2 technique knowledge sample obtain patient use technique ) . Indeed , knowledge limit fact biliary stricture identify ERCP . Final diagnosis reach agreement 2 cytopathologists . Specimens interpret normal , atypical ( consider benign ) , highly atypical ( suspicious cancer ) , malignant . Cell cellularity single epithelial cell cellularity grade absent , rare , moderate , numerous . Finally , nuclear detail grade poor , satisfactory , excellent . Other data record indicate Table 1 . A list patient ' name cell block inclusion perform kept , indication obtain material collect cytobrush G.I.U.M . Histopathological examination Surgical specimen obtain patient undergo duodenopancreatectomy subjected histopathological examination , particular detect carcinomatous lymphangitis . Statistical analysis The final clinical diagnosis case base cytologic result plus specimen obtain surgery , autopsy , via percutaneous puncture endoscopic ultrasonography fine needle aspiration , disease course , include sign clinical deterioration , death , stable course and/or improvement follow-up . Information collect review hospital record telephone contact patients/families refer physician 1 , 6 12 month ERCP . For purpose calculate sensitivity specificity , highly atypical ( suspicious cancer ) malignant diagnose cytopathologic examination regard `` positive '' , diagnose normal atypical ( consider benign ) regard `` negative '' .4 Sensitivity specificity calculate use Fischer exact test . A p value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Based hypothesis sensitivity detection cancer would 45 4 70 % specimen obtain brush G.I.U.M . catheter respectively , calculate least 68 patient final clinical diagnosis cancer include reach statistical significance 5 % 20 % alpha beta error , respectively . An interim analysis perform collection resection specimens 5 patient evaluate possible lesion biliary tract surround tissue .</detailed_description>
