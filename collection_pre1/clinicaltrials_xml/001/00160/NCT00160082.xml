	<brief_summary>The primary objective ass effect Xepol compare placebo physical health muscle strength subject post-polio syndrome.The secondary objective ass effect Xepol compare placebo functional balance , activity pattern , pain , fatigue , sleep , vitality , muscular strength , pulmonary capacity , walk ability , balance safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Xepol ( Human Immunoglobulin ) Subjects With Post-Polio Syndrome ( PPS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Rationale : In early open non-controlled study 10 patient PPS , Xepol give three day . The patient show improvement muscular strength co-ordination decrease pain . The aim study investigate finding confirm large , double-blind , randomise placebo control study . There simple clinical finding specific laboratory change use indicate severity progress PPS . Different self-reporting questionnaire objective measure disability often use clinical study include SF-36 questionnaire , muscle strength measurement walk test . The primary secondary variable study base clinical experience literature review .</detailed_description>
