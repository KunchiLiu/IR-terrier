	<detailed_description>Study Overview This randomize control pilot study compare safety efficacy substitution atazanavir ( ATV ) ATV/RTV ritonavir boost PI patient ongoing viremia experience hyperlipidemia and/or require treatment lipid lower agent . In study 60 subject ritonavir boost PI-containing antiretroviral regimen experience hyperlipidemia ongoing HIV viremia randomize 1:1:1 ratio either switch ritonavir boost PI component antiretroviral regimen ATV ATV/RTV , continue ritonavir boost PI-based regimen . No change antiretroviral regimen allow first 12 week . Thereafter , investigator may change background ARVs base result screen resistance test . No new class antiretrovirals allow add 48 week . Subjects monitor closely 48 week careful assessment CD4 profile , viral load lipid profile well drug resistance replication capacity . Stopping rule implement base CD4 viral load profile ensure subject safety . The objective study determine whether protease inhibitor regimens less adverse impact lipid profile maintain stable CD4 profile compare standard ritonavir boost PI regimen . Background Antiretroviral regimens include ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor commonly recommend prescribed , particularly patient degree drug resistance . Despite potency boost regimen , many HIV-infected patient receive regimen incomplete viral suppression yet maintain clinical stability CD4 count nadir level : call 'CD4/HIV disconnect ' state . It likely state CD4/HIV discordance due part maintenance drug resistant HIV virus relatively unfit , replication capacity ability infect destroy CD4 cell compromise . The selective pressure exert antiretroviral therapy appear important maintain drug resistant relatively unfit quasispecies . It show even patient CD4 count 50 cells/cc ongoing viremia maintain clinical benefit continue therapy . Unfortunately , lipid abnormality commonly see patient receive boost PI regimen . For example , clinical trial lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) give treatment naïve subject , approximately 1/3 develop grade 2 high lipid abnormality 48 week . There grow concern lipid abnormality increase risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . In fact , recent data suggest increase risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality relate HIV infection and/or antiretroviral therapy . There increase effort direct minimize long-term toxicity antiretroviral therapy maintain clinical benefit . ( Witness high degree interest treatment interruption strategy limit toxicity associate long-term antiretroviral therapy . ) Atazanavir ( ATV ) , recently approve PI , appear little impact lipid profile subject enrol clinical trial . Other advantage atazanavir dose schedule overall tolerability . Furthermore , recent study use ritonavir-boosted ATV also show favorable lipid effect compare LPV/r . Ritonavir boost provide high drug level therefore may improve potency ATV , especially PI-resistant virus .</detailed_description>
