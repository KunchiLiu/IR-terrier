	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two treatment use treat frozen shoulder arthroscopy forceful stretch shoulder home stretch therapy see one relive pain improves shoulder motion quickly . The purpose try understand cause frozen shoulder . For purpose , tissue take shoulder surgery study presence level protein call cytokine ( Connective Tissue Growth Factor )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arthroscopy Manipulation v Home Therapy Program Treatment Adhesive Capsulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adhesive capsulitis shoulder relatively common entity poorly understood produce significant amount morbidity afflict patient . The natural history adhesive capsulitis begin understood . It self-limiting disease , may take 18 36 month resolve . During time , individual suffer significant amount pain miss large amount work . Many surgeon treat process early manipulation outcome never report prospective manner . Some author advocate conservative non-operative treatment , know natural history shoulder near resolution . The primary purpose study examine prospective randomize manner result continuous non-operative management versus arthroscopic capsulectomy . This study determine operative intervention arthroscopic capsulectomy shorten natural history adhesive capsulitis , give comparable result non-operative management final follow-up 2 year . A second purpose study try identify mechanism ( ) responsible adhesive capsulitis . Recent research suggest cytokine connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) may involve inflammatory fibrotic process . The second purpose study involve histological immunohistochemical analysis capsular synovial tissue routinely remove arthroscopic capsulectomy . Tissue take subject surgical treatment group compare tissue patient undergo arthroscopic capsulectomy reason adhesive capsulitis ( control group ) . Location concentration CTGF compare group . If level CTGF elevate treatment group hypothesize , development test agent specifically reduce action CTGF may indicate . A specific agent block CTGF develop near clinical trial .</detailed_description>
