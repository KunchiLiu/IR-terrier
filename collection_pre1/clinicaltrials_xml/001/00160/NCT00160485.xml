	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether oral administration glyburide effective insulin treatment gestational diabetes . 1 . SYNOPSIS : Infants bear mother gestational diabetes ( GDM ) risk variety adverse perinatal outcome include macrosomia subsequent birth trauma cesarean delivery , neonatal hypoglycemia , polycythemia , jaundice , hypocalcemia , respiratory depression newborn intensive care unit admission . These adverse outcome thought relate degree maternal hyperglycemia pregnancy . Women GDM typically treat insulin lower blood glucose level near-normal possible . A single randomize trial suggest oral sulfonylurea , glyburide clinically effective safe alternative insulin therapy . 2 . Many obstetric care provider adopt use glyburide routine management gestational diabetes . The American College Obstetrics Gynecology American Diabetic Association state study need large patient population use newer oral hypoglycemic agent support use pregnancy . 3 . STATUS : Previous study demonstrate maternal-fetal transfer glyburide compare insulin effective alternative insulin . Additionally , publish cost analysis conclude glyburide significantly less costly insulin treatment GDM . The benefit oral agent management gestational diabetes include less discomfort patient drug administration , low requirement patient education administration injectable medication less chance error dose . Our study population ethnically diverse incidence large gestational age infant lower largely Hispanic population study Langer et al . Many obstetrician , include , apply different criterion Langer diagnose gestational diabetes , decide institute insulin therapy . It goal confirm prior single study concern safety efficacy glyburide reduce complication GDM utilize ethnically diverse population realistic goal glycemic control . To end add medical literature support alternative therapy insulin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PLAN : Women present prenatal care routinely screen gestational diabetes ( GDM ) one-hour 50gm oral glucose challenge test ( GCT ) . This screening occur first prenatal visit risk factor ( marked obesity , prior pregnancy affect GDM , prior macrosomic infant , glycosuria , strong family history diabetes ) GDM identify intake history . If risk factor GDM identify initial screen negative , GCT administer 24-28 week gestation . At institution , GCT consider positive , one hour ingestion 50gm oral glucose solution , serum glucose great equal 135mg/dl . This screen cutoff varies among medical treatment facility . Positive screening test follow diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test ( GTT ) . A positive diagnosis require two threshold meet exceed . Women diagnosis gestational diabetes receive dietary counseling instruction perform capillary glucose nurse educator . If &gt; 20 % record home glucose value excess target range follow initiation appropriate diet , woman offer enrollment study . All woman agree participate study ultrasound perform confirm gestational age rule fetal anomaly , serum glycosylated hemoglobin A1C assist exclude preexist diabetes fast insulin level assist determine degree insulin resistance . A serum glycosylated hemoglobin A1C repeat upon admission delivery . Subjects randomized standard therapy insulin arm insulin dose calculate established standard . Dosing base upon 2 shot combine dose long act short act insulin give prior breakfast dinner . If fast glucose value remain elevated dinner NPH move bedtime . Subcutaneous administration recommend consistent anatomic region , preferably abdomen . Insulin adjust weekly basis order maintain optimal glucose control . Women assign receive glyburide begin 2.5mg orally morning meal . Glyburide dosage increase weekly indicate maximum daily dose 20mg achieve glucose control . If patient continue elevate fast glucose may split 12 hr interval . If maximum daily dose glyburide result reach threshold value , patient administer insulin however data analyze intent-to-treat basis . Upon admission delivery additional maternal blood collect hemoglobin A1C , glyburide level . These value utilize determine efficacy treatment comparison fetal umbilical cord value . At delivery fetal blood umbilical cord collect glucose , hematocrit , insulin level , representative sample , glyburide level . These value utilize determine whether insulin glyburide provide superior efficacy maintain value within normal limit . Cord blood glyburide level obtain representative sample expose subject . When clinically indicate lab perform pediatrician newborn , heel stick glucose hypoglycemia , bilirubin level neonatal jaundice , calcium level suspect hypocalcemia , value obtain review newborn record . In gestational diabetic , post partum assessment diabetic status assess either fast glucose determination 2hr glucose tolerance test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pregnant woman age 18 fail achieve adequate glucose control diet therapy alone . Delivery plan participate medical treatment facility . Women preexist diabetes mellitus diabetic ketoacidosis . Hypersensitivity study medication Underlying vascular disease medical condition know affect fetal growth drug clearance : severe chronic hypertension , systemic lupus erythematosis , chronic renal insufficiency , hepatic disease , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome thrombophilia . Fetal anomaly identify ultrasound prior initiation therapy . Fetal aneuploidy . Diagnosis GDM make 32 week gestation ( fetal growth pattern may impossible affect gestational age . ) Use supplemental herbal/nutraceuticals contain chromium , garlic , gymnema ( may cause hypoglycemia ) .</criteria>
