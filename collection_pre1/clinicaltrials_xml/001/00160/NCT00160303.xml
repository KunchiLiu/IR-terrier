	<brief_summary>The purpose research study effect two different injection therapy treatment lateral epicondylitis ( tennis elbow ) . Specifically , look therapy provide good short long-term relief pain , treatment allows well function less disability , treatment give back good strength affect hand . Each subject receive one two treatment . Although treatment usually well tolerate , important make comparison believe one therapy may better long term effectiveness , low cost , small number potential side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Prolotherapy v Corticosteroid Tennis Elbow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lateral Epicondylitis tennis elbow one commonly diagnose upper-extremity musculoskeletal disorder see general practice . It characterize painful enthesopathy tendinosis common extensor tendon out region elbow fibro-osseous junction . `` Although tennis elbow '' originally make note medical literature Runge 1873 , term derive `` Lawn Tennis Arm '' later describe Morris 1882 . Traditionally , lateral epicondylitis cause characteristic pain lateral elbow region often associate significant morbidity . It occur commonly individual 40 50 year equally affect men woman . The dominant arm involve 75 % patient . While etiology propose , include radial nerve entrapment , generally agree tennis elbow result repetitive mechanical micro-trauma overuse , many case biomechanical association , vocational avocational correlation . This condition often bring repeat flexion extension wrist direct injury epicondyle elbow . However , patient unable recall identify precipitate event . The average duration episode lateral epicondylitis 6 24 month , 10 % 30 % case result work absenteeism , lead high loss productivity . Numerous treatment option describe lateral epicondylitis . Most case manage primary care setting , although forty possible treatment , still lack consensus optimal therapeutic management . Moreover , treatment lack sound scientific evidence . The preferred method treatment lateral epicondylitis often involve corticosteroid injection without addition local anesthetic . In general , injection local corticosteroid commonly use reduce inflammation patient chronic tendinopathies lateral epicondylitis . However , since inflammation necessarily major feature lesion , present , may present vital component heal response . Inhibiting process may result suboptimal outcome . Thereby , despite popularity , rationale use corticosteroid controversial evidence long-term benefit lack . Likewise , potential side effect infection , tissue atrophy , pigmentation change , hyperglycemia , etc . exist . Moreover , many recommendation use corticosteroid injection anecdotal . In review Labelle et al , conclude insufficient scientific evidence support use corticosteroid injection lateral epicondylitis . Assendelft et al come similar conclusion review find exist evidence corticosteroid injection lateral epicondylitis unclear question regard optimal timing , dosage , injection , technique , injection volume remain unanswered . Prolotherapy , though yet extensively study , another emerge therapy present alternative corticosteroid injection treatment lateral epicondylitis . It continue rise popularity , especially clinicians commonly treat musculoskeletal injury . With early origin date back time Hippocrates , prolotherapy define iatrogenic stimulation wound heal tissue repair process injection irritant solution damage ligament , tendon , joint thus encourage heal repair . Essentially , occur result localized inflammatory reaction stimulation round cell infiltration resultant collagen synthesis , formation firm permanent fibrous tissue bone . The new collagen run parallel exist ligament tendon linear orientation , result ultimate strengthen stabilization ligament , tendon , joint subsequent reduction pain . It generally safe well tolerate use throughout western medical community 50 year . Existing research prolotherapy begin 1930s Lerich first describe rich supply nerve ending articular ligament . This re-introduced Gardner 1953 . Also 1950s , Hackett , describe joint pain ligamentous , first scientifically demonstrate method strengthen ligament injection proliferant solution . At time , use irritant solution think work creation scar tissue rather development proliferative response . As pain perceive arise normal tension ligament stretch relaxed ligament fiber , result abnormal tension stimulation sensory nerve nerve fiber stretch , reduction pain thereby think arise stabilization relaxed ligament generation strong scar tissue structure . Reduction pain realize Hackett report 82 % success rate treatment chronic spinal pain 1816 patient treat 20-year period . A subsequent study 1982 rabbit ligament Lui et al show prolotherapy might positive effect mass , thickness , enthesis strength , weight-to-length ratio inject ligament , compare control . A different study Klein et al 1989 show histological documentation ligament proliferation human subject . This response proliferative injection , objectively increase diameter collagen fiber associate decrease pain well objective increase range motion . In another study , Ongley et al find statistically significant reduction ligamentous laxity 9 month inject end collateral cruciate ligament knees substantial ligamentous laxity measure computerized knee analysis device . All study find decrease pain level patient involve . In addition early study , focus mechano-proliferative effect , later study proliferant injection therapy consider affect subjective pain level objective outcome functional status . For example , Ongley 's study , patient experimental group show improvement pain concomitant decrease level disability . Faber et al , use dextrose , phenol , glycerin contain proliferant , able document increase size sacroiliac ligament . They also able show moderate mark improvement pain function subject receive prolotherapy concert manipulation versus control receive saline injection sham manipulation . Reeves et al show prolotherapy solution consist 10 % dextrose result clinically statistically significant improvement patient knee osteoarthritis . The clinically significant change see joint pain , subjective joint swelling , flexion range motion , tendency buckle , sign significantly impact level function . Although study show positive effect proliferant therapy mechanical property ligament well subjective improvement pain function , suffer small sample size , inadequate control , inconsistency study design methodology . Kim et al review critically analyze three randomize , control study use dextrose , glycerin , phenol prolotherapy chronic low back pain . They find inconclusive data support use due lack adequate control , heterogeneity patient diagnosis , variation solution inject . Nevertheless , clinical use prolotherapy warrant investigation . As lateral epicondylitis involve cascade injury insertion common extensor tendon fibro-osseous junction , patho-physiologic response proliferation joint seem promise . Based previous study , prolotherapy would theoretically strengthen stabilize overstretched torn strand fibrous tissue cause cascade instability generation pain junction . Not would prolotherapy thereby improve subjective pain , would improve objective strength stability joint resultant increase function . Moreover , , prolotherapy would benefit patient society large offer relatively safer , less expensive , longer last alternative corticosteroid .</detailed_description>
