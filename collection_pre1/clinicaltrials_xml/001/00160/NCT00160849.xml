	<brief_summary>1 . Objectives Primary - To investigate possibility maintain virological suppression HIV infect patient , switch LPV/r antiretroviral agent - To assess immunological response patient switch LPV/r single agent , base observation change serum level CD4+ cell . Secondary - To investigate rate clinical laboratorial adverse event two treatment group . - To investigate rate emergence antiretroviral resistance mutation two treatment group , case virological failure current regimen . - To describe adherence prescribe regimen two treatment group - To describe change body fat distribution ( abdominal , arm thigh circumference ) lipid profile , patient two treatment group - To describe rate clinical failure antiretroviral therapy two treatment group . 2 . Patient population : The 60 patient select investigator accord study ’ inclusion exclusion criterion , divide 2 group 30 patient . 3 . Study design : The study multicentric , open-label , randomize . Virological , immunological clinical failure analyze group . In addition , data clinical laboratorial toxicity compliance record . 4 . Regime : - Group 1 maintenance currently use antiretroviral therapy - Group 2 switch LPV/r antiretroviral monotherapy dose 400/100 mg 12/12 h food . Patients group 2 treat previously non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( Efavirenz Nevirapine ) instruct take 4 capsule Lopinavir/r 12 h , first 14 day therapy ( Week 2 visit ) . 5 . Duration : 96 week treatment</brief_summary>

Pregnant lactate female patient . If patient becomes pregnant study , discontinue study . 2 . Patients allergic reaction hypersensitivity Lopinavir Ritonavir . 3 . A patient previous history opportunistic disease ( appendix 1 ) CD4 count 100 cels/mm3 . 4 . A patient present HIV viral load test result 400 copies/mL past 6 month . 5 . Patient receive receive systemic chemotherapy past 6 month . 6 . Laboratory test result Hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 750 cels/mL Platelet count &lt; 20,000/mL Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x UNL &gt; 6 x UNL patient use Indinavir Atazanavir ALT AST &gt; 2 x UNL Creatinine &gt; 2 x UNL 7 . Patient take drug know contraindicate concomitantly lopinavir/r . Please refer product ’ package insert . 8 . According investigator ’ opinion , patient little probability comply study protocol unsuitable reason .</criteria>
