	<brief_summary>Cancer esophagus serious cancer . Studies show use chemotherapy radiation surgery promising treatment approach , one quarter one half tumor shrink 50 % size chemotherapy radiation . In patient good response treatment , survival follow esophagectomy increase , although amount increase vary quite bit different study . Older study use drug Cisplatin 5-fluoruracil . Although combination drug beneficial , wish use new combination drug may effective esophageal cancer . The chemotherapy drug use study Cisplatin Irinotecan . We also want find side effect drug cause give radiation , often side effect occur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Historical surgical series report chance cure surgery alone approximately one four . Many phase II study phase III study examine role induction ( preoperative ) chemotherapy radiation . In general , study demonstrate trend improve survival use induction regimen one phase III study report significant improvement survival . Two meta-analyses fail demonstrate clear advantage induction regimen . When trial review , apparent subgroup patient find time resection complete pathological response treatment , patient clearly experience improved survival . These previous trial use old chemotherapy agent . Nevertheless , cisplatin remain one active drug available treat solid tumour . Irinotecan new drug demonstrate significant activity colorectal cancer recently esophageal cancer . A previous single institution trial cisplatin irinotecan esophageal cancer demonstrate significant response acceptable toxicity . By give one cycle chemotherapy alone first , expect dysphagia usually experience patient improve sufficiently nutritional support , i.e . feed tube , require ( demonstrate previous study drug combination ) . The drug give concurrently external beam radiation order take advantage radiosensitizing property drug . This follow boost dose radiation , provide total dose tumourcidal range . Surgery follow boost dose radiation . This study propose combine two drug demonstrate activity esophageal cancer , cisplatin Irinotecan , radiation prior surgery , hypothesis active agent offer good control distant metastatic disease . Their radiosensitizing property , combine radiation , improve local control provide increase rate pathological complete response patient surgically resectable esophageal cancer .</detailed_description>
