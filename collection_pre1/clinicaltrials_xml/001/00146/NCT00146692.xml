There many barrier prevent access prompt effective treatment , amenable intervention , others ( distance healthcare ) less . This study concentrate modifiable financial barrier care . With aim increase health service utilization reduce morbidity mortality among child five , government currently implement policy aim reduce financial barrier health care . There time on-going debate concern relative importance cost barrier health care . Though theoretically aim reduce barrier achieve , actual impact directly assess demonstrate mean intervention trial . This study aim determine mean randomize trial impact reduce barrier morbidity due severe malaria among child 6 month five year outpatient utilization .

	<detailed_description>Objectives General : To assess mean randomize trial , impact improve financial access primary health care morbidity due severe malaria utilization health service among child six month five year age . Specifically : 1 . To compare rate severe anaemia child five year age household randomize improved financial access without first year . 2 . To compare number admission hospital malaria among child five year age households improved access household without . 3 . To compare health service utilization rate among child five year age households improved access household without . 4 . To compare reported median period onset febrile ( presumed malaria ) illness report health facility among child five year age households improved access household without . 5 . To document community knowledge , attitude practice regard severe malaria user fee , exemption pre-payment scheme indicator poverty . Study design method Study Design : The propose study two-arm randomize control trial ass impact improve financial access primary health care morbidity due severe malaria utilization service among child 6 month 5 year . It quantitative element base pre-determined outcome well qualitative element . Intervention The intervention group enrol pre-payment scheme operate area allow free access primary care include diagnosis drug whenever ill limit , limited access secondary health care . The control group pay user fee health care pertain normally . Recruitment Enrolment Procedures : Study participant select use process outline trial profile annexe . The actual study participant child 6 month five year age households select . Inclusion Criteria : - Child household age 6 month 5 year - Informed consent parent - Household child belongs resident Dodowa sub-district intend remain resident end next two year Exclusion Criteria - Parents refuse participate study - Household due emigrate study area within two year - Household currently enrol Randomization Procedure A stratified randomization procedure use . Households divide three stratum base residence ≤5km , 5-10km , &gt; 10km health centre respectively since distance health facility know major determinant use may adequately take care simple random allocation . Allocation intervention carry separately within stratum . Household head within stratum invite meeting random number allocate household . The number raffle ticket drop rotate barrel mixed thoroughly view barrel rotate . A child invite pick paper allocate intervention control drawn , alternately . Those intervention group pre-payment make year one ; others year 2 . After draw barrel rotate . This process use make trial acceptable community member show lack favouritism randomness allocation ( Adapted [ 43 ] . Since registration would close year , household able change group study end . Outcome Measures Primary : • Prevalence severe anaemia among child five year age group one peak malaria transmission season . Secondary - Mean haemoglobin count among two group study end - Number admission hospital malaria among child five year age group - Average number visit per child five year primary care facility among group - Anthropometric measurement child two group - All cause mortality group All household Dodowa sub-district least one child 6 month 5 year register pre-payment scheme year eligible participate study . The information obtain data base household DHIMT office . This sub-district , mainly forest estimate 2003 midyear population 30,154 , select early study show high incidence malaria district . Household head representative invite either three locality meeting base distance health facility , study explain consent sought participation study . Those agree participate particular record enrol study . They randomize two group use procedure already describe . Baseline data collection include haematological , anthropometric assessment interview carry participant slide parasite random subset . Background variable household include know risk factor malaria type housing , use insecticide treat material , use preventive measure indicator household wealth document . Children find haemoglobin count le 6g/dl , fever history fever patent parasitaemia treat accord local guideline ; reason withdrawal study . Differences voluntarily register pre-payment scheme , term health service utilization , health status , household wealth variable document subsidiary part study . Follow-Up : Morbidity monitoring carry hospital/clinic base passive case detection system throughout malaria transmission season May October . This complement one cross-sectional household survey end malaria transmission season November interview , haematological , parasitological anthropometric assessment repeat . Children find severe anemia second survey haematological work-up comprising Hb electrophoresis , full blood count , stool examination . All study participant visit clinic treated health worker usual accordance current standard treatment guideline Ghana . In case mortality , culturally appropriate time , trained field worker visit home standard questionnaire administer child 's mother caretaker . The result review three independent physician arrive possible diagnosis . If two three agree diagnosis malaria , diagnosis accept . For child visit hospital die hospital , hospital case note review necessary , attend physician interview complete information child 's illness . Plan Data Collection Interviews : Standard clinic record form use collect data primary care clinic hospital combination direct interview abstraction information case note train research health staff . Any unclear information case note verify clinician concern immediately . Field data also collect mean standard pre-coded questionnaire administer household head . Individual in-depth interview also administer respondent use interview guide . Focus group organize contact participant arrange suitable meeting date , time venue , previous week . Focus group consist 8-12 discussant moderator observer/notetaker . Discussions record mean tape recorder permission discussant . Laboratory Measurements : A finger-prick sample blood obtain use haemocue® microcuvette haemoglobin count estimation . Thick thin blood film obtain finger prick sample parasitological measurement survey . Anthropometric Measurements : All child weigh use infant weigh scale hang scale usually use weigh child child welfare clinic child unable stand alone mechanical stand-on scale old child stand alone . Supine length child record use measure board whilst height measure use take stand height child 2 year . The mid upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) child measure MUAC tape ( TALC Institute Child Health ) . Data Management Analysis : Quantitative data record pre-coded questionnaire clinical data record form whilst qualitative data record tape recorder small notebook . Data check daily accuracy consistency , correctly label , store data entry . For quantitative data , data entry clerk carry double entry raw data questionnaire clinical record form electronic form Microsoft Access . After data entry , data clean carry identify error inconsistency correction . Analysis carry use Stata version 8 . Summary statistic , odds ratio , confidence limit p-values calculate compare outcomes two group primary end point secondary endpoint . Stratified analysis carry base age , sex , distance health facility household wealth . Means continuous variable rise haemoglobin count compare use Student t-test . Geometric mean use compare parasite density . Qualitative data analyse use Textbase Alpha convert transcribed text file ASCII file .</detailed_description>
