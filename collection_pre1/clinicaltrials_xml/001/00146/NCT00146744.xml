	<detailed_description>The BCG vaccine widely available several decade . It easy cheap produce , give neonate young child effective prevent severe manifestation disease meningeal tuberculosis miliary tuberculosis . However , term capacity vaccine protect adult human show wide range efficacy , include zero level protection . Due general realization BCG lose protective effect , particularly term prevent adult-onset tuberculosis , major effort make try develop new alternative vaccine . One candidate , Mtb72F/AS02A , polyprotein derive two know M. tuberculosis antigen adjuvanted AS02A . Mtb72F/AS02A candidate TB vaccine development two indication : prevention primary TB infection young child highly endemic area adjunct treatment TB adolescents adult .</detailed_description>
