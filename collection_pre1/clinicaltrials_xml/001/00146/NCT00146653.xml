	<brief_summary>We propose comparison standard ACT base heparin management protocol child undergo CPB patient-specific heparin concentration-based heparin management protocol . We hypothesize heparin concentration-based anticoagulation management protocol CPB child result effective attenuation hemostatic activation reflect decreased level thrombin formation , ultimately , good preservation hemostasis postoperatively . An additional 20 patient enrol address validation heparin concentration calculate Hepcon machine laboratory-measured heparin concentration . These patient randomize therefore receive intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>40 patient randomly assign either traditional heparin management group intervention group . The traditional group treat initial heparin dose 400 units/kg standard amount heparin , dictate circuit size , add CPB circuit prime . An ACT target value 480 second maintain throughout bypass period . Should ACT fall 480 second , additional bolus 100 units/kg heparin give ACT return target value . At end CPB , heparin neutralized standard reversal 4 mg/kg protamine . An additional 20 patient enrol address validation heparin concentration calculate Hepcon machine laboratory-measured heparin concentration . These patient randomize therefore receive intervention . For intervention group , heparin dose ( HDR ) response assay perform prior surgical incision Hepcon instrument . The hepcon machine perform patient-specific HDR assay base body surface area , determines project heparin concentration require patient achieve ACT 480 second . The HDR assay provide initial dose heparin give patient well amount heparin added CPB circuit . Additional heparin dos determine hepcon instrument administer need patient 's heparin concentration fall project reference concentration . The hepcon instrument also calculate protamine dose need reverse heparin end CPB . For comparison group , assay use hepcon machine measure whole blood heparin concentration ACT obtain patient following interval : initial heparin dose , 30 minute initiation CPB , start rewarming immediately prior discontinuation CPB . A sample anti-factor Xa activity also obtain time interval validate heparin concentration determine hepcon machine laboratory measure value . Blood sample biochemical marker hemostatic activation collect patient initiation CPB administration initial heparin dose conclusion CPB protamine infusion . The following biochemical marker hemostatic activation measure : prothrombin fragment 1.2 , fibrinopeptide A , free tissue factor pathway inhibitor , factor V , factor VIII , beta-thromboglobulin . The following measure clinical outcome also record : amount blood product transfuse protamine administration , time administration protamine leave operating room , 24-hour chest tube drainage , first post-operative weight , time extubation duration ICU stay . Additional 20 patient : These additional 20 patient enrol provide validation Hepcon-measured heparin concentration laboratory-measured heparin concentration ( anti-factor Xa activity ) . A blood sample obtain heparin dose response ( HDR ) assay prior surgical incision Samples also obtain measure heparin concentration Hepcon machine anti-factor Xa activity two time period : initial heparin dose immediately prior discontinuation CPB . In addition , 20 patient also ACT test analyzed Hepcon machine protamine give .</detailed_description>
