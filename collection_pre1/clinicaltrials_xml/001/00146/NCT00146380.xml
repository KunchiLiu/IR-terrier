	<brief_title>A Study Zidovudine/Lamivudine Either Nevirapine Nelfinavir Reduction Mother-to-child HIV Transmission During Breastfeeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Approximately 800,000 HIV-infected infant born year , two third sub-Saharan Africa . The rate HIV transmission mother infant estimate 13-48 % absence antiretroviral treatment . Interventions currently available prevent mother child transmission resource-limited setting among breastfeed population child HIV transmission breastfeed period . Because safe alternative breastfeed currently viable option many HIV-infected woman sub-Saharan Africa , important identify intervention decrease transmission infant period . Objective : To demonstrate regimen use highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) maximally suppress maternal viral load late antenatal period first six month lactation safe , effective implement resource poor setting order reduce risk HIV transmission infant . Study Design : The study open label Phase II trial Zidovudine/Lamivudine depend maternal CD4 count , either Nevirapine Nelfinavir ass safety , tolerance activity maternal HAART reduce risk transmission among breastfeed HIV infected woman Kisumu Kenya . Justification : Transmission breastfeed account 25-40 % mother-to-child transmission HIV . This trial ass safety activity potent triple drug combination lower maternal viral loadprenatally , intrapartum breast feeding . The regimen give HIV infected woman 34 week gestation 6 month breastfeed postpartum . Infants receive single dose NVP . Women encourage breastfeed exclusively wean abruptly 6 month . Mother infant follow 24 month . Clinical laboratory evaluation perform periodically determine infection status infant side effect medication mother infant . The estimated sample size need address transmission reduction HAART comparison single dose NVP well related safety two HAART regimens 520 mother-infant pair . Comparison make data previous study ( HIVNET O12 Uganda malaria vertical transmission study Kisumu ) data current Prevention Mother Child Transmission ( PMCT ) program Kisumu . Expectations significance : A HAART regimen nature may potentially show dramatic decrease transmission compare exist PMCT regimen . Given continue decrease cost ARVs relatively low efficacy exist PMCT regimen , regimen would seriously consider wide implementation resource poor setting elsewhere .</detailed_description>
