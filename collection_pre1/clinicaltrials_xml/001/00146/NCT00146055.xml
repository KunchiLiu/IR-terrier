	<brief_title>Low-Intensity Preparation Allogeneic Transplant Patients With Cancers Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combinations high-dose chemotherapy radiation therapy ( preparative regimen ) follow allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplantation unrelated donor current treatment approach . Chemotherapeutic drug radiation give high dos increase effectiveness . High-dose chemotherapy radiation therapy generally affect cell divide . They use treat cancer cancer cell divide often cell . High-dose treatment severely damage patient 's bone marrow patient longer able produce need blood cell . Peripheral stem cell transplantation allow stem cell damage treatment replace healthy stem cell produce blood cell patient need . Patients experience number complication transplantation . Some temporary relatively minor ; yet others life threaten . Many doctor consider high-dose chemotherapy , radiation , bone marrow stem cell transplantation best available treatment option disease specific circumstance . However , study explore whether less-intensive preparative therapy peripheral stem cell transplantation prove safer , less side effect , effective treatment certain disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must candidate unrelated donor stem cell transplantation donor recipient must 5/6 6/6 match . In addition , patient must one follow histologically confirm diagnosis : 1 . Patients previously treat AML ( M0 M7 FAB classification ) complete remission ( CR ) . second later CR . 530 % persistent blast bone marrow follow induction salvage chemotherapy . highrisk feature first complete remission e.g . presence Philadelphia chromosome noncorebinding factor type chromosomal abnormality . 2 . Patients myelodysplastic syndrome IPS int1 , int2 highrisk score transfusiondependent . 3 . Patients chronic myeloid leukemia accelerate , blastic , chronic phase 4 . Patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia first complete remission high risk disease [ Ph ' ( 4 ; 11 ) , WBC &gt; 30,000 , &gt; 4 week achieve CR ] . second great CR . achieve CR follow induction salvage therapy . 5 . Patients Hodgkin 's nonHodgkin 's lymphoma curable conventional chemotherapy tumor large 5 centimeter diameter . 6 . Patients myeloma plasma cell neoplasm : stage III presentation . stage III presentation respond progress first line therapy . 7 . Patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia Waldenstr√∂m 's macroglobulinemia progress firstline therapy . 8 . Patients MDS myeloproliferative disorder history lifethreatening complication related thrombosis , hemorrhagic diathesis intractable hypercatabolic state ( fever cachexia ) . 1 . Cardiac disease symptomatic nature ; &lt; 25 % ejection fraction . 2 . Severe renal disease ; creatinine &gt; 2.O mg/dl creatinine clearance &lt; 40 ml/min . ( Corrected age ) 3 . Severe pulmonary disease &lt; 60 % normal ( FEV1 &amp; FVC ) . 4 . Severe hepatic disease ; bilirubin &gt; 2.0 , and/or transaminase &gt; 3 x normal correct age . 5 . Karnofsky performance status &lt; 60 % . 6 . Patients evidence HIV infection western blot . 7 . Any condition , opinion transplant team substance abuse , severe personality disorder would keep patient comply need protocol would markedly increase morbidity mortality procedure .</criteria>
