	<brief_title>Sirolimus- Paclitaxel-Eluting Stents Small Vessels ( ISAR-SMART-3 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although use bare metal stent reduce restenosis coronary vessel diameter â‰¥3 mm compare plain balloon angioplasty , dedicate randomized study fail show beneficial effect stent balloon angioplasty vessel small reference diameter . In spite refinement stent design periprocedural therapy , risk restenosis bare metal stenting setting remain elevate . Nowadays , percutaneous coronary intervention small vessel account 35-67 % interventional procedure perform patient coronary artery disease , bare metal stent use , restenosis detect 35 % treated patient repeat revascularization procedure need 20 % . Several randomized trial show stent elute antiproliferative drug , sirolimus- paclitaxel-eluting stent device approve commercial use far , highly effective reduce restenosis compare bare metal stent . Subgroup analysis trial show efficacy either sirolimus stent paclitaxel stent extends also patient undergo coronary stenting small sized vessel . In addition , three randomize study sirolimus-eluting stent bare metal stent use coronary artery small 3 mm report 82-96 % reduction relative risk restenosis sirolimus stent thus , provide convince evidence role drug-eluting stent effective treatment strategy coronary artery small reference diameter . At present , direct evidence relative efficacy prevention restenosis sirolimus stent paclitaxel stent implantation small coronary vessel . Selecting effective device particularly high-risk category account large proportion percutaneous coronary intervention , may important clinical economic implication . Comparisons data subgroup analysis different trial suggest might difference efficacy prevent restenosis sirolimus paclitaxel stent . However , indirect comparison subject many limitation consequently , conclusion base result may erroneous . Therefore , reliable guidance selection effective drug-eluting stent treatment lesion coronary vessel small reference diameter could provide head-to-head comparison device . Comparison : Sirolimus-eluting stent paclitaxel-eluting stent patient undergo stenting small coronary vessel .</detailed_description>
