	<brief_summary>In Spain , family physician currently recommend prescribe unsupervised walk program coronary heart disease ( CHD ) patient part cardiac rehabilitation program . However , family physician provide CHD patient supervise exercise ( 30 minute pedal stationary bicycle 60-85 % peak heart rate ( HR ) attain maximal symptom limit treadmill test , 3 time week ) primary care health center , think patient improve functional capacity , quality life , control cardiovascular risk factor , walk achieve ideal exercise intensity maximal benefit walk . This study design investigate CHD patient get health benefit supervise exercise program health center unsupervised walk program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order obtain maximal health benefit , CHD patient attain exercise intensity 60 85 % maximal symptom-limited heart rate ( HR ) . This currently attain patient prescribe unsupervised walking program . The OBJECTIVE randomize clinical trial investigate CHD patient improve functional capacity quality life , control cardiovascular risk factor well , come health center pedal 30 minute stationary bicycle , 3 time week , HR monitor make sure attain HRs within prescribed interval , supervise health personal , walk without supervision . For purpose , low risk CHD patient 11 Spanish health center randomly assign supervised exercise group ( ESCAP ) another unsupervised walking group ( control ) . Both group also provide health education correspond treatment cardiovascular risk factor control complication prevention family physician . The average change observe two group compare , basis intention treat analysis covariance . We use mixed-effect model take account intra-patients intra-center correlation .</detailed_description>
