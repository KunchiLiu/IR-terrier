	<brief_summary>Nitrous oxide standard part anaesthetic breathing mixture . It often assume reduces amount oxygen reach low part lung . However result previous study computer model suggests opposite may true , oxygen level blood actually high nitrous oxide . This study seek determine whether nitrous oxide increase decrease blood oxygen level anaesthetize patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect N2O Administration Arterial Oxygenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concentrate second gas effect nitrous oxide ( N2O ) uptake well describe , produce rapid uptake N2O first several minute inhalational anesthetic . This significantly increase alveolar arterial O2 partial pressure . Theoretical model alveolar gas exchange predict effect may transient may persist phenomenon . However , N2O know promote absorption atelectasis poorly ventilate lung unit . This study , carry pre-cardiopulmonary bypass 20 patient undergoing coronary artery surgery , measure change PaO2 minimum 30 minute relaxant general anesthesia FIO2 30 % . Patients randomise two group . The intervention group N2O introduce follow baseline blood gas measurement , control group continue breathe identical FIO2 N2 . The change PaO2 two group primary endpoint comparison .</detailed_description>
