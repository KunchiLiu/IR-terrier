	<detailed_description>Effective antiretroviral therapy significantly improve prolonged life HIV-infected person . However , antiretroviral use also associate diverse array `` unnatural '' metabolic complication adverse medical condition . These problem , together subsequent long survival , increase patient ' risk develop renal , hepatic , cardiovascular , neurological , rheumatologic , end-organ disease , cancer . Longer survival also increase pool HIV-infected person capable transmit virus , could accelerate pace U.S. epidemic ; however , ability physician care HIV-infected person incorporate prevention clinical practice effectiveness intervention extensively evaluate . The goal Study Understand Natural History HIV AIDS ( `` SUN '' Study ) : - monitor incidence metabolic medical complication relate treatment HIV infection attendant prolong survival , - identify risk factor associate development metabolic medical complication , - monitor contribution complication condition morbidity mortality HIV infection , - evaluate efficacy structure program prevention activity , integrate routine medical care HIV patient reduce HIV transmission . The SUN Study design enroll follow 5 year cohort 1,000 HIV-infected adult HIV specialty care center four U.S. city : Denver , Minneapolis , Providence , St. Louis . Data gather longitudinal real-time chart review , biannual physical examination ( e.g. , body mass index [ BMI ] , blood pressure ) , repeat non-invasive imaging ( e.g. , dual energy x-ray absortiometry [ DEXA ] scanning , carotid ultrasonography ) regularly schedule laboratory test ( e.g. , serum lipid , pap smear , urinary microalbumin ) . Data collection quality control manage Cerner Corporation . After sufficient enrollment , ( circa 200 person per site ) structure prevention program reduce HIV transmission introduce . The impact intervention evaluate subjectively ( e.g. , self-reported change behavior audio computer-assisted self-interviewing [ ACASI ] questionnaire ) objectively ( e.g. , change sexually transmitted disease [ STD ] incidence ) . Outcomes include determination incidence therapy-related metabolic complication adverse condition associate longer survival , identification risk factor complication condition , reduction report objective measure risky sexual behavior .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject age 18 year old . Subject HIVinfected confirm positive enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) western blot test , HIV viral load &gt; 5,000 copy , genotyping confirms infection HIV . For highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) naïve subject ( i.e . person prior substantial antiretroviral [ ARV ] exposure ) : Subject 's CD4+ cell count 100 500 cells/mm³ Subject ever receive 30 day consecutive nonconsecutive treatment ARVs regardless reason ( e.g. , pharmacokinetic study , postexposure prophylaxis , prevention vertical transmission pregnancy ) . For HAARTexposed subject ( i.e . person take take HAART time enrollment ) : Subject 's CD4+ cell count &gt; 100 cells/mm³ Subject 's previous and/or current treatment ARVs consist HAART ( duration number regimen ) define : &gt; 3 antiretroviral drug least 2 antiretroviral drug class ( nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NRTI ] , nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NNRTI ] , protease inhibitor [ PI ] ) ; , &gt; 3 NRTIs . Other antiretroviral combination course study develop become accepted equivalent best available therapy . Subject receive HAART either prescribe therapy context supervise study . Subject complete least two visit within past year clinical facility patient eligible enrollment . Subject anticipate continue receive care clinical facility eligible enrollment least 2 year . Subject able understand sign inform consent . Subject pregnant . Subject incarcerate . ( footnote 1 ) Within past 60 day subject : Had AIDSdefining opportunistic infection illness . Received chemotherapy immunomodulating therapy ( e.g. , glucocorticoid , interleukin2 , interferon ) . ( footnote 2 ) Subject expect live less 2 year . Subject unable unwilling complete part study protocol . Subject consider principal investigator ineligible enrollment reason , include limited remote geographic location , experience prior research study , inconsistency historian , etc . Subject unable refuse provide inform write consent due physical psychological incapacity ( e.g. , persistent vegetative state , mental disability ) . Footnotes : 1 . Participants temporarily suspend study pregnant incarcerate enrollment . 2 . Cases eligibility criteria unclear require special consideration refer Executive Committee final decision .</criteria>
