	<brief_summary>Pulmonary inflammation play important role development chronic lung disease ( CLD ) preterm infant . This inflammation occur early postnatal life . Any therapy could beneficial prevent CLD start early . The investigator ' previous double-blind study show early ( &lt; 12 hour ) postnatal use intravenous dexamethasone 4 week significantly suppress pulmonary inflammation significantly reduce incidence CLD . However , use dexamethasone associate increase incidence infection sepsis . Their follow-up study also suggest increase incidence psychomotor anomaly . As compare intravenous administration , endotracheal instillation provide local anti-inflammatory effect less systemic side effect . Infants eligible study birth weight ( BW ) &lt; 1500 gm severe respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) require mechanical ventilation shortly birth . After informed consent obtain , infant randomly assign depend condition infant . The primary outcome change cytokine ( interleukin-6 , 8 , 10 TNF-α ) level BAL fluid . Chronic lung disease ( CLD ) judge 36 postmenstrual week . Infants study group ( S/B group ) receive surfactant ( Survanta® , Abbott Laboratories , North Chicago , IL ; 100 mg 4 mL/kg/dose ) Budesonide ( Pulmicort® , AstraZeneca Pty Ltd. , Australia ; 0.5 mg 1mL/kg/dose ) , control group ( S group ) receive surfactant ( Survanta® Abbott , 100 mg/kg/dose ) saline ( 1mL/kg ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Growing evidence suggest early , postnatal pulmonary inflammation may play important role development chronic lung disease ( CLD ) preterm infant mechanical ventilation.The investigator 's previous study demonstrate interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) , marker inflammation , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid increase early 2 day age infant subsequently develop CLD compare infant develop disease . Thus therapy beneficial preventing CLD , start early . Early postnatal use intravenous dexamethasone therapy 4 week significantly suppress pulmonary inflammation significantly reduce incidence CLD . However , use dexamethasone associate increase incidence infection sepsis affect immediate outcome contribute significantly mortality . It show school age child receive early postnatal dexamethasone therapy prevention CLD show significant increase incidence neuromotor cognitive delay . Based result study , early systemic dexamethasone therapy recommend . Budesonide high local anti-inflammatory activity one extensively use inhaled glucocorticoid . Budesonide decrease airway hyperresponsiveness reduces number inflammatory cell mediator present airway patient asthma . A previous study indicate addition Budesonide Survanta affect surface tension . We propose randomize control trial study whether early endotracheal instillation Surfactant-Budesonide ( S/B ) mixture would reduce lung inflammation improve pulmonary outcome . We measure cytokines level BAL fluid evaluate local anti-inflammatory effect S/B treatment .</detailed_description>
