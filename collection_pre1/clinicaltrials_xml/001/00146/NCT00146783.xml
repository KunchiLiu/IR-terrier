	<detailed_description>Background Pregnant woman , particularly first second pregnancy , high risk Plasmodium falciparum infection infection often asymptomatic lead maternal anaemia low birth-weight . One approach prevent malaria pregnancy prompt effective management clinical malaria . In area moderate high transmission however , peripheral parasitaemia sensitive indicator many woman placental parasitaemia may peripheral parasitaemia . Another option administer full curative dos effective antimalarial drug predefined interval pregnancy ( IPTp ) without screen parasitaemia . The efficacy IPTp study mostly area high perennial transmission Kenya Malawi . IPTp however little investigated West Africa transmission often intense highly seasonal . It may appropriate translate result area different range transmission intensity across sub-Saharan African region need study effect IPTp highly seasonal intense transmission area West Africa . IPTp SP show effective reduce maternal anaemia , prevalence placental parasitaemia incidence low birth weight . SP offer reasonable combination ease use associate increase compliance , low cost , relatively good tolerance safety . However , useful therapeutic life ( UTL ) predict SP likely short , part due prolong half-life , cause high probability select resistant strain consequent rapid development resistance . The emergence spread SP resistance increasingly undermine strategy , deplete currently available affordable drug usable intervention pregnancy . It therefore important alternative antimalarial safe effective pregnancy identify . Specific primary objective To assess compare efficacy combination sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine amodiaquine , sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine amodiaquine use IPTp , reduce incidence anaemia ( Hb &lt; 11g/dl ) week 34-36 among primigravidae secundigravidae . Specific secondary objective To evaluate effect SP/AQ , SP AQ : 1 . The mean birthweight infant among primigravidae secundigravidae 2 . The incidence clinical malaria pregnancy among primigravidae secundigravidae 3 . The prevalence anaemia ( Hb &lt; 11g/dl ) delivery among primigravidae secundigravidae 4 . The prevalence placental parasitaemia among woman first second pregnancy deliver health facility train TBAs 5 . The prevalence peripheral parasitaemia week 34-36 among primigravidae secundigravidae 6 . The prevalence maternal peripheral parasitaemia delivery among primigravidae secundigravidae 7 . To determine safety tolerability AQ , SP use alone combination , among pregnant woman parities 8 . To determine prevalence molecular marker resistance AQ SP among pregnant woman malaria parasitaemia enrolment 9 . To document factor influence woman 's attitude towards ANC attendance , use chemoprophylaxis ITNs , determine informs choice deliver particular facility STUDY SITE The study carry Kassena-Nankana district northern Ghana . The resident mainly subsistence farmer . There two main season , short wet season June September , transmission Plasmodium specie peak long dry season . The primary resource Navrongo Health Research Centre district-wide surveillance system , Navrongo Demographic Surveillance System ( NDSS ) , longitudinal population registration system update every 90 day . The district 4 health centre , 3 clinic 140-bed hospital serf referral centre . Information collate year 2002 Kassena-Nankana district indicate expected 6050 pregnancy , 95 % register ANC , average number visit 2.7 . There 2173 ( 36 % ) supervise delivery , 1279 health facility 894 trained TBAs . 794 2405 ( 33 % ) pregnant woman haemoglobin level less 10g/dl registration . STUDY POPULATION Pregnant woman 16 -32 week gestation attend antenatal care clinic district hospital four main health centre district eligible join study . The main endpoint assess primigravida secundigravidae however safety data collect woman . STUDY DESIGN The study carry two phase , pre-intervention phase document woman 's knowledge , attitude practice antenatal care , chemoprophylaxis use insecticide treat bednets factor influence choice deliver . The second phase , intervention , three-arm randomized blind control trial . Intervention study - Enrolment procedure The study explain woman group day 's ANC activity begin . In order interfere routine ANC activity woman may want recruit proceed study team routine ANC care . After obtain informed consent , socio-demographic information , obstetric history include previous ANC attendance current pregnancy , history illness past week , information bed net use collect . Gestational age obtain ANC card assess midwife . Anthropometric index measure weight , height mid-upperarm circumference . The blood pressure axillary temperature also measure . Fingerstick blood sample drawn haemoglobin testing , malaria thick blood smear filter paper sample , woman assess eligibility . Subjects randomize individually receive study drug . The code envelope write study form sample . The subject 's name , address date first dose note envelope , ensure woman receives right regimen three-day period also subsequent dos IPTp . To ensure compliance , dose supervise either health facility , home visit ( Days 1 2 ) . Women receive one three dos drug , depend gestational age recruitment , thus woman recruit 16 - 19 week receive three dos , recruit 20 -26 week , two dos recruit 27 -32weeks , one dose . The interval dosing schedule 8 week , however minimum interval allow 4 week . All woman encourage deliver health facility train traditional birth attendant , give identification card take health facility necessary sample take label adequately delivery . These identification card also bear note woman may receive AQ , SP combination IPTp therefore give drug clinical malaria , avoid woman give repetitive dos within short interval time . Such woman give Quinine 10mg/kg 8 hourly 7days recommend national treatment guideline . Assessment drug tolerance adverse drug reaction All woman visit home Days 7 10 look adverse event due study drug . They advise report health facility experience untoward effect drug prior , home visit . The frequency severity spontaneous elicited adverse event record . In light information obtain , association event study drug judge per WHO guidelines52 . All serious adverse event report DSMB immediately , follow write report fully document event , available laboratory information clinical data , include report . Follow-up At subsequent visit IPTp week 34 -36 , simple questionnaire administer assess presence malaria symptom , potential side effect study drug since last assessment , bednet use . To ensure woman complete subsequent dos IPTp , list woman due second third dos computer-generated , remind least week next dose due attend ANC . At 34 -36 week blood sample take assess haemoglobin level ( Hb ) peripheral parasitaemia . Women severe anaemia ( Hb level &lt; 7g/dl ) refer hospital investigation management . Women turn ANC follow home collect blood sample . Blood slide symptomatic woman read immediately woman find parasitaemia give Quinine 10mg/kg 8 hourly 7 day per national treatment guideline . Delivery Women deliver hospital bloodsmears make fingerprick , maternal side placenta , Hb level assess . Women deliver health centre placental blood smear , peripheral blood smear take . Those delivered TBAs placental smear take . Blood sample haemoglobin estimation woman deliver health centre TBAs take home within 7 day delivery . Assessment Hb carry woman deliver spontaneously without complication post-partum haemorrhage hospital day delivery 7days post delivery , construct nomogram would use estimate haemoglobin level delivery woman deliver health centre TBA could Hb do day delivery logistic reason . All infant deliver hospital health centre weigh gestational age assess modification Dubowitz 's examination within 24 hour delivery53 . To ensure birthweights infant deliver home take within seven day delivery , list woman gestation 34 week generate accord area residence . This would give Community Key Informants ( CKI ) would contact weekly field staff information deliver TBAs home . A follow-up make take weight baby . Mothers encourage inform CKIs soon delivery . The TBAs ask inform CKIs whenever deliver study subject , sample collect . Infants Dubowitz score obtain classified follow : Premature -LBW : gestational age &lt; 37weeks birthweight &lt; 2500g IUGR-LBW : gestational age ≥ 37weeks birthweight &lt; 2500g Normal birthweight : birthweight ≥ 2500g Withdrawal study A withdrawal shall enrol subject complete study plan . This may due ( ) withdrawal consent , ( b ) reaction attributable study drug ( c ) termination pregnancy ( abortion miscarriage ) . A withdrawal form shall fill person , indicate reason withdrawal , follow outcome measure , unless decline give consent .</detailed_description>
