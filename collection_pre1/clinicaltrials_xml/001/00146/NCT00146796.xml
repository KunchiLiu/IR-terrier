	<brief_summary>There clear evidence diagnosis malaria much Africa sub-optimal negative impact patient care . Many treat malaria . Rapid diagnostic test ( RDTs ) dipsticks diagnose malaria rapidly accurately . The main objective trial determine mean randomised trial impact introduce RDTs standard outpatient set Tanzania appropriate prescription antimalarial . Other objective : 1 . To compare high , moderate low P.falciparum transmission intensity sensitivity specificity malaria diagnosis use hospital slide result RDTs , use research quality slide reference . 2 . To estimate specificity clinical diagnosis malaria high , moderate low transmission intensity P. falciparum . 3 . To compare proportion case report slide-negative treated malaria proportion RDT-negative case treat malaria . 4 . To evaluate cost effectiveness introduce RDTs compare current diagnostic practice facility microscopic diagnosis malaria different level transmission P.falciparum .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomised Trial Rapid Diagnostic Tests Diagnosis Malaria Tanzania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In hospital outpatient facility , patient consent participate free malaria test test randomly assign hospital laboratory blood slide RDT . Sensitisation sit information displayed . Before start intervention study conduct meeting medical staff explain intervention standard study procedure . We provide information publish source accuracy 'Paracheck ' compare expert slide reading . Staff encourage use RDT result way would use blood slide result equivalent accuracy . We consult Malaria Control Programme additional information would disseminate deploying test . Information display patient attend clinic , period trial , malaria diagnosis free request clinic doctor . Patients consent participate randomly allocate receive either slide test RDT . Patients consent participate receive free hospital slide test request clinic doctor treatment follow routine practice . Inclusion criteria 1 . All patient age attend outpatient facility eligible consider trial exception admit outpatient ward appear study clinical officer distress ill participate . 2 . The inclusion criterion clinician decision request malaria test . The exclusion clinician decides would prefer hospital slide patient enter trial- case note excluded trial . Patient recruitment inform consent All patient attend clinic inform trial , either mean write information sheet , read verbally . They ask verbal inform consent provide baseline information see clinic doctor . Consenting patient assign screen number ask question baseline study relate personal socio-economic characteristic main present symptom . On exit consultation patient ask show treatment give request malaria test make . Clinicians indicate preference hospital slide- patient exclude . Those eligible trial malaria test request invited participate trial . Further information trial provide , guardian provide write informed consent ( witness read ) . Those consent trial assign RDT hospital slide open opaque seal envelope within slip study allocation , generate computer randomisation ( see , randomization ) ) . These numbered , number become study number patient . Opening envelope define enter trial . If discovering allocation patient demand different test deem withdrawal trial outcome note . Patients withdraw offer standard care ( see below- ethical issue ) . If RDT allocate , rapid test malaria slide ( later expert read ) take qualified member survey team label slide RDTs patient 's name , date study number . The result RDT read record research assistant test give back patient present doctor consultation . Clinic doctor read result give treatment accord clinical judgement . If hospital slide request patient present slide request slip hospital laboratory accord normal clinic practice . In addition take blood slide , laboratory staff ask take duplicate slide retain , stain double-read late time accord research methodology . The result give back patient review consultation accord normal clinic practice . On exit consultation patient see review blood slide RDT result briefly interview collect data treatment give change result review result doctor . Some patient may choose leave clinic result without review consultation . This determined failure appear exit survey . Primary outcome : The proportion clinical treatment consistent parasitological diagnosis randomise RDT compare randomise hospital slide . This composite measure define antimalarial give research slide positive antimalarial give research slide negative . Secondary outcome : The proportion slide negative case give antimalarial ( overprescription antimalarial ) RDT arm compare standard care arm . The proportion slide positives give antimalarial slide positive ( underprescription antimalarial ) . The proportion case treat malaria clinical ground alone Sensitivity specificity RDT hospital malaria slide compare double read research slide result . The proportion patient receive additional alternative treatment antimalarial follow negative blood slide RDT result . This inform cost-effectiveness model . From 1 publish study 1 unpublished study estimate antimalarial prescribe least 45 % case negative blood slide result . This expect apply transmission setting . To detect minimum 25 % reduction require total 820 transmission band .</detailed_description>
