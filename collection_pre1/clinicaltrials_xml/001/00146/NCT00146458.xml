	<detailed_description>Concurrent radiotherapy chemotherapy standard treatment locally advanced cervical cancer . The radiation field adjust accord extension disease , especially presence metastatic lymph node . At present , CT/ MRI apply detection enlarge lymph node , reference radiation field . However , infrequently , small-sized lymph node CT/MRI may metastatic enlarge node may result reactive hyperplasia . Unlike CT/ MRI , 18F-FDG positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) provide novel mean image malignancy could differentiate benign tumor malignancy functional assessment . Recent study demonstrate high accuracy FDG-PET scan evaluation metastasis patient several type cancer compare CT scan MRI . But , report concern usefulness FDG-PET cervical carcinoma . Our hypothesis add FGD-PET study thorough MRI provide good staging , especially identification metastatic pelvic para-aortic lymph node . In addition , whole body scan may also detect occult distant metastasis detectable standard workup . Our initial result phase II study -- - '' A Preliminary Report Using FDG-PET Detect Extra-pelvic Lesions Cervical Cancer Patients Enlarged Pelvic Lymph Nodes Shown MRI/CT Images ” indicate FDG-PET help detect occult small metastatic lesion , result change radiation treatment plan . Nevertheless , high-risk group patient , distant metastasis still occur short period treatment . Therefore , also question whether enhancement detection provide FDG-PET translated improvement final overall survival . To answer question , Gynecologic Oncology Study Group Chang Gung Memorial Hospital design phase III clinical study . Patients enlarge pelvic lymph node detect MRI image enrol randomize two group initiation concurrent chemoradiation .</detailed_description>
