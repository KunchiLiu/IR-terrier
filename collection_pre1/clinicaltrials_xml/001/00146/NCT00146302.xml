	<brief_summary>The World Health Organization ( WHO ) currently recommend BCG vaccination birth develop country . Pre-term infant vaccinate reach chronological age 40 week . Due difficulty establish correct gestational age , vaccination policy BCG many develop country define birth weight rather gestational maturity . In study area , low birth weight ( LBW ) infant ( &lt; 2500 g ) suppose vaccinated birth ; instead mother ask return vaccination child gain sufficient weight . BCG mark immune stimulatory effect animal human study observational study suggest BCG associate non-specific reduction mortality area high infant child mortality . The specific objective study examine effect early vaccination LBW child adverse event , purify protein derivative tuberculin ( PPD ) reaction , scar size , morbidity , mortality randomise prospective study BCG vaccination birth versus later ( accord policy ) among child 19 month age Guinea-Bissau . The hypothesis BCG vaccination low birth weight ( LBW ) child birth reduces infant mortality high-risk group 25 % .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Criteria verification : 1,600 low birth weight ( LBW ) infant recruit national hospital local health centre enrol randomised trial BCG vaccination birth versus later vaccination ; information potential adverse event follow early BCG vaccination LBW infant ; follow-up child 12 month age home visit 2 , 6 12 month age ; assessment tuberculin reaction scar-formation 2 , 6 12 month age ; assessment BCG vaccination coverage infancy ; assessment all-cause mortality infancy . Recruitment : All LBW child deliver maternity ward national hospital local Health Centre offer enrolment study . Furthermore , child bear home study area weigh referred BCG vaccination health centre quickly possible . For mother LBW child , current policy purpose study explain . If accepts participation , draw randomisation number indicate whether child BCG vaccinate early . At time enrolment , child examine clinically anthropometrics , major risk factor document ( include TB exposure home , recent infection , access malaria drug , ethnic group , schooling , housing condition , mother 's recent drug consumption ) . Newborns include study consider sufficiently healthy discharge hospital , arrive health centre bear home . Twins large part LBW child twin common study area ( around 2 % birth ) . They allocate group , could confusion mother vaccinated . As happen moment , mother child receive vaccination birth recommend attend local health centre soon child gain weight . For ethical reason , possible use placebo could mean child would BCG vaccinate mother believe child fact vaccinate . The child vaccinate initially subsequently vaccinate limited number health centre capital , administer BCG vaccination . The intradermal vaccination technique vaccine storage supervise , monitor whether scar-formation PPD reactivity similar child vaccinate different centre assure vaccination administer way . Follow-up : To assure proper identification child , mother newborn child drive home document location home . The child include study visit 2 , 6 , 12 month age , identify subsequent BCG vaccination inspection vaccination card , weigh child measure arm-circumference , assess BCG scar document morbidity , hospitalisation survival . Sick child identify visit refer treatment relevant health institution . If child still vaccinate , mother encourage bring child vaccination . Should child die , verbal autopsy conduct . The child follow morbidity , hospitalisation , mortality 12 month age . Within study area may follow long . In order assure detection possible complication BCG vaccination , LBW child enrol study provide card identify child , mother tell bring child consultation local Health Centre consultation treatment free charge . The expected rare complication treat accord WHO 's recommendation . A subgroup child enrol immunological study . To assess effect BCG vaccination immune profile , initially unvaccinated LBW child blood sample collect turn BCG vaccination health centre . For child examine , BCG vaccinate LBW child match age sex examine blood sample collect .</detailed_description>
