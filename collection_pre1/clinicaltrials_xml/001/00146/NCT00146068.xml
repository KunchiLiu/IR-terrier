	<brief_title>EARLY IFNB-1a Simvastatin Combination Therapy Clinically Isolated Syndrome Suggestive Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interferon beta-1a ( IFNB-1a ) , FDA approve therapy relapsing-remitting ( RR ) MS several mechanism action . It lower proinflammatory cytokine production inhibits antigen presentation class II major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) molecule . It also reduce metalloproteinase activity , lead decrease migration T-lymphocytes central nervous system ( CNS ) , subsequent inhibition inflammatory lesion formation . We propose combination therapy early stage disease second immunomodulatory agent target different step pathogenesis disease may add effectiveness IFNB-1a . IFNB-1a administer intramuscularly 30 mg per week particularly suitable combination therapy due proven efficacy Clinically Isolated Syndrome ( CIS ) , favorable safety profile low frequency neutralize antibody ( NABs ) IFNB-1a comparison form IFNB-1a . Recent study report significant anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effect statin , cholesterol-lowering agent . Statins disrupt cellular membrane lipid raft , inhibit cluster T-cell receptor ( TCR ) , co-stimulatory , adhesion molecule , require optimal T-cell activation . Along inhibit T-cell activation , statins decrease IFNB inducible MHC class II expression , suppress effective antigen presentation . They block migration activate mononuclear cell peripheral circulation CNS block LFA-1 adhesion molecule reduce metalloproteinase type 9 secretion . While anti-inflammatory effect tolerable oral dos may justify use monotherapy RR MS , pleiotropic mechanism action show synergistic effect IFNB-1a study vitro . We propose simvastatin may enhance immunomodulatory effect INFB-1a patient CIS suggestive MS combination may even effectively prevent disease activity administer early course disease .</detailed_description>
