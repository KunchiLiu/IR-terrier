	<brief_summary>Pregnant woman vulnerable malaria , significant implication health pregnancy . Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) currently first line drug treatment malaria pregnancy Tanzania surround country , resistance emerge rapidly . Alternative drug must find , new drug drug combination recommend many deployment first line treatment point SP resistance force policy change . However , data safety efficacy combination pregnant woman . This randomised trial aim assess efficacy safety , include birth outcome , pregnant woman malaria second third trimester . A total 900 pregnant woman randomise either standard treatment ( SP ) one three potential drug , drug combination recently recommend WHO expert panel . These SP-amodiaquine , chlorproguanil-dapsone ( Lapdap ) , amodiaquine-artesunate . Primary outcome treatment failure . Secondary outcome include 28 day slide clearance , maternal side effect , foetal viability birth outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Antimalarial Drugs Used Pregnancy Tanzania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study assess therapeutic efficacy safety SP current first line drug , three potential alternative combination treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria pregnancy , area appreciable level SP resistance rise HIV seroprevalence . Specifically study compare clinical parasitological response side effect follow drug regime : 1 . SP 2 . SP + amodiaquine ( SPAQ ) 3 . Chlorproguanil+dapsone ( Lapdap ) 4 . Amodiaquine + artesunate ( AQAS ) TRIAL DESIGN Primary end point The primary end-point trial treatment failure . This define : - Any : 1. need rescue treatment due clinical deterioration define altered sensorium , convulsion , persistent vomiting , renal impairment , respiratory distress , fall Hb 75g/dl , case initial haemoglobin le 9 g/dl drop 20 % start Hb initial Hb le 9g/dl , time admission ; 2. persistence fever parasitaemia day 32 ; 3. increase parasite load day 3 ; 4. failure clear parasite day 7 ; 5. rescue medication recurrent malaria day 14 ; 6. slide parasite positivity day 14 . Secondary endpoint Secondary endpoint include follow : - 1 . Incidence foetal death treatment , define absence foetal heartbeat assess Doppler 2 . Hypoglycaemia require treatment 3 . Parasite recrudescence re-infection day 28 4 . Parasite clearance day 3 5 . Level recovery haemoglobin day 14 6 . Fever clearance time 7 . Incidence perinatal neonatal mortality , assess 4-6 week due date delivery 8 . Clinically apparent neonatal abnormality , assess 4-6 week due date delivery 9 . Placental malaria 10 . Preterm delivery 11 . Other adverse event treatment The trial 1 . This randomize controlled trial four arm 2 . The slide reader assess primary endpoint blind treatment allocation , analysis perform intention-to-treat 3 . Direct Observed Therapy ( DOT ) dose study regimen employ 4 . Drug dose pack blister pack , label patient number use possible . 5 . Selection Withdrawal Patients Pregnant woman mild-moderate , slide proven , falciparum malaria recruit Antenatal wing ( ANC ) Maternal Child Health ( MCH ) clinic Muheza ( Teule ) Hospital . Pregnant woman Muheza Township surround village attend clinic . Nurses attend clinic interview febrile woman woman recent ( past 24 hour ) history fever probable diagnosis malaria refer study team . Those signs/symptoms mild-moderate anaemia also refer . All referral re-interviewed examined Medical Officer study team exclude concomitant infection ( ) . Duplicate thick thin blood smear make , Giemsa stain pH 7.2 , examine microscopically . The consent form administer meeting inclusion criterion enrol upon consent . Inclusion criteria A pregnant woman : - either positive blood smear P.falciparum least 1000 asexual parasites/uL asymptomatic woman follow symptom within 2 day prior consultation : history fever ; headache , vomit , chills/rigors , and/or follow sign : temperature &gt; 37.50C &lt; 39.50C , Hb &gt; 5 &lt; 9 g/dl ) together P.falciparum parasitaemia density ( case ) follow : 1. exclusion criterion ( see ) 2. 14-34 week pregnant day attend ANC clinic OPD ; 3. viable foetus , define presence foetal heartbeat sonicaid pinnard ( foetal heartbeat hear 14 week ) 4. able take study drug oral route 5. able attend stipulate day follow clinic provide specimens 6. give inform write witnessed verbal consent participate , also parent/guardian age &lt; 15 year ( conformity Tanzania Law ) Those &gt; 34 week exclude close term may deliver 28 day follow period . Exclusion criterion Exclusion criterion include : - 1. severe complicate form malaria ( define WHO , 1996 ) ; 2. pregnancy first trimester ; 3. mixed plasmodial infection ; 4. complicate pregnancy e.g . signs/symptoms toxaemia pregnancy ; 5 . 23 abortion stillbirth ; 6. presence concomitant disease mask assessment response treatment ; 7. intake drug contraindicate pregnancy e.g . tetracycline , cotrimoxazole macrolide antibiotic ; 8. intake drug effective antimalarial activity within last 2 week . 9. significantly abnormal baseline haematology ( except anaemia ) clinical chemistry parameter e.g . laboratory evidence renal impairment ( serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl ) hepatitis ( alanine aminotransferase ALT &gt; 5 time upper limit normal ) ; 10. previous participation study : Women second episode malaria complete 28-day follow detail record offer quinine re-enrolled . 11. multiple gestation pregnancy eg twin 12 . Mother age 38 year Patients malaria enter trial fulfil exclusion criterion treat optimum way decide attend physician . In general , severe disease receive parenteral quinine whilst mild disease receive SP . Withdrawal criterion Withdrawal criterion include : - 1. withdrawal consent non-compliance assign study regimen ; 2. appearance specie Plasmodium ; 3. vomit within one hour re-dosing ; 4. protocol violation . If necessary withdraw patient treatment phase , administration study drug discontinue . If patient still parasitaemic , quinine give rescue therapy unless clinical reason use another drug . For withdrawal outside treatment phase team carry safety efficacy assessment measurement would carry next schedule visit apply delivery ( unless patient lose follow ) . 5 . Patients fail treatment treat rescue treatment count treatment failure ( see ) . TREATMENT OF PATIENTS Study regimens Study drug purchase source reputable source Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) . Dosages base body weight ( kg ) patient schedule . 1 . SP ( sulfadoxine 25mg/kg stat ) ( SP ) 2 . SP ( sulfadoxine 25mg/kg stat ) + Amodiaquine ( 10mg/kg x 3 day ) ( SPAQ ) 3 . Chlorproguanil-dapsone ( 1.2 mg/kg 2.4 mg/kg respectively 3 day ) [ Lapdap ] 4 . Amodiaquine ( 10mg/kg x 3 day ) + Artesunate ( 4mg/kg x 3 day ) ( AQAS )</detailed_description>
