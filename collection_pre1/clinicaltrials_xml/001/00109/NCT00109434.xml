	<brief_summary>The main purpose study find often low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) happen night exercise late afternoon . The study also see factor predict low blood sugar go develop . Blood sample also draw measure two hormones—glucagon epinephrine ( adrenaline ) —to see affected exercise . Glucagon help raise blood sugar low . Epinephrine cause symptom make person aware blood sugar low . From blood sample , substance blood may also measure see affected exercise . A second purpose study find whether exercise affect accuracy continuous glucose sensor ( CGMS make Medtronic Minimed ) . The study also look accuracy different home glucose meter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Relationship Between Exercise Hypoglycemia Children With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many child adult type 1 diabetes drop blood sugar exercise . When someone low blood sugar , body try return blood sugar normal . Some study show exercise , blood sugar may drop later day night . However , know often happen . Also , enough know exercise affect blood sugar awareness low blood sugar . Some study adults show exercise may affect body 's natural response low blood sugar exercise future . For study , subject two in-patient hospital stay 1 4 week apart , last 24 hour : one exercise one 75-minute exercise session late afternoon . ( The order exercise sedentary day determine random . ) Prior hospital admission , subject keep detail diary insulin use hypoglycemia one week . On two admission , insulin regimen diet similar possible . On 2 admission , follow occur : - A CGMS sensor insert calibrate . - An intravenous catheter collection blood sample insert . - Blood sugar measurement make Ultra , BD Logic , Freestyle meter every half hour begin 10:00 p.m. 6:00 a.m. - Blood sample glucagon , epinephrine , glucose collect hourly 10:00 p.m. 6:00 a.m. On exercise day , - In morning , subject run treadmill 5 minute determine setting need achieve heart rate 140 . - Exercise begin approximately 4:00PM consist 15 minute treadmill heart rate approximately 140 follow 5-minute rest period . This cycle repeat 3 time total four 15-minute exercise period 5-minute rest period ( 75 minute total ) . A heart rate monitor worn throughout time exercise ascertain effort put forth . - BG ( blood glucose ) measurement make use Ultra , BD Logic , Freestyle meter ( 1 ) prior start exercise , ( 2 ) 3 rest period , ( 3 ) immediately follow exercise session , ( 4 ) 15 minute interval one hour follow completion exercise . Blood sample collect central lab time sample glucagon epinephrine .</detailed_description>
