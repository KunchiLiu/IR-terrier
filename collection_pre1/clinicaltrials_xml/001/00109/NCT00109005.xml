	<brief_summary>This study test whether experimental drug call Revlimid ( lenalidomide ) reduce tumor size prolong survival patient metastatic melanoma ( melanoma spread beyond original tumor site ) . It also examine toxicity blood effect Revlimid . Patients 18 year age old stage IV ocular melanoma may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram , chest x-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) scan image scan need , bone scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , ultrasound , positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Participants admit National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center 24 hour first oral dose Revlimid . During hospital stay , blood drawn dose give 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 24 hour dose see body handle drug . If drug well tolerate , patient send home 21-day supply drug take day 21 day , go drug 7 day . This regimen constitute one 28-day treatment cycle . Treatment cycle may continue 2 year . Patients keep daily diary side effect blood drawn week . The drug dose may adjust accord laboratory test result . If unacceptable toxicity occur , treatment may stop . Patients agree biopsied undergo procedure treatment begin end treatment cycle 3 6 . A small area skin numb medicine small piece tumor remove needle small cut tumor . The tissue examine microscope . Patients return NIH first month treatment every 3 month evaluate tumor treatment side effect . The visit include physical examination , x-rays scan evaluate tumor . Visits schedule every 3 month treatment ; every 3 month 2 year afterwards ; every 4 month 1 year ; need . Patients brain magnetic resonance imaging scan year watch new tumor area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) Treat Advanced Ocular Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Patients stage IV ocular melanoma available treatment option overall poor prognosis . - Pre-clinical early clinical evidence suggest lenalidomide activity solid tumor . - This trial design evaluate safety efficacy two different dos novel antiangiogenic immunomodulatory agent , lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) . Objectives : Primary Objectives : - Determine response rate lenalidomide two dose level patient Stage IV ocular melanoma . - To determine toxicity lenalidomide two dose level set . Secondary Objectives : - To determine progression free overall survival patient Stage IV ocular melanoma treat lenalidomide . - When easily accessible , obtain tissue baseline therapy evaluate effect agent pathway , think modulate lenalidomide pre-clinical study . - To determine pharmacokinetics lenalidomide two dos patient Stage IV ocular melanoma . - To determine dose level potentially superior efficacy acceptable toxicity . Eligibility : - Patients &gt; 18 year age stage IV ocular melanoma , measurable disease . - Patient must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status = 2 life expectancy 3 month . - Patients must adequate organ function . - Patients must prior surgery , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiation therapy , biological therapy least 4 week prior start study medication . - Patients receive mitomycin C , nitrosoureas , carboplatin must 6 week last administration chemotherapy . - Patients must acute , critical illness , . - All patient sexually active able conceive require use contraception treatment lenalidomide Design : - A phase II trial patient randomize 2 dose level lenalidomide administer 21 day every 28 day 2 year . - 76 patient ( allow 3 inevaluable patient per dose level ) enrol 4 5 year . - The objective trial determine two group patient ( 5 mg 25 mg dose level ) whether , CC5013 able associate response rate ( partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) ) rule 10 % ( p0=0.10 ) favor improve response rate 30 % ( p1=0.30 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . All patient stage IV ocular melanoma , measurable disease consider . 2 . Patients must histopathological documentation ocular melanoma confirm Laboratory Pathology/National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Clinical Center National Institutes Health . This tissue obtain outside National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . 3 . Patient must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 . 4 . Patients must life expectancy 3 month . 5 . Hematological eligibility parameter ( prescreen ) : Granulocyte count great 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count great 100,000/mm^3 If creatinine great 1.5 mg/dL , obtain 24 hour urine collection . Creatinine clearance must great 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 . Hepatic function : bilirubin ( total ) less equal 2.0 mg/dl ; Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less 10 x upper limit normal ; Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less 10 x upper limit normal . 6 . Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy surgery , grade 1 less unless specify . 7 . Patients must prior surgery , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiation therapy , biological therapy , least 4 week prior start study medication . Patients receive mitomycin C , nitrosoureas , carboplatin must 6 week last administration chemotherapy . 8 . Patients must acute , critical illness , include serious untreated infection . 9 . Patients must willing return National Institutes Health ( NIH ) followup visit . 10 . All patient sexually active able conceive require use contraception treatment lenalidomide . Only two criterion allow Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) status child bear potential : hysterectomy menopause 24 consecutive month . Women child bear potential require use two method birth control , one highly effective method one additional method , time treatment one month completion lenalidomide treatment . These method must use least four week start lenalidomide , treatment , least four week follow last dose lenalidomide . Acceptable form birth control include : Intrauterine device ( IUD ) Latex condom Hormonal ( Birth control pill , injection , implant ) Diaphragm Tubal Ligation Cervical cap Partner 's vasectomy Two barrier method may use physician agree highly effective method medically contraindicate . Women childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test 24 hour prior start lenalidomide . Men sexually active must agree use latex condom . Patients must able understand sign inform consent form . Patients must great equal 18 year age . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients evidence active brain metastasis exclude . Patients must complete excision radiotherapy remain asymptomatic stable disease show magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) least six month . 2 . Patients pregnant lactate . No data currently available excretion lenalidomide breast milk . Although preclinical data suggest teratogenicity compound , relationship thalidomide , exclude patient pregnant lactate . 3 . Patients history unstable newly diagnose angina pectoris , recent myocardial infarction ( within 6 month enrollment ) , New York class IIIV congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive lung disease require oxygen therapy uncontrolled seizure activity eligible . 4 . Patients know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) may increase risk infection since lenalidomide effect cell involve immune system . 5 . Patients prior therapy lenalidomide . 6 . Patients know hypersensitivity reaction lenalidomide .</criteria>
