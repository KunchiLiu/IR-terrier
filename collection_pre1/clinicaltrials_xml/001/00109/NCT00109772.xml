	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Lenalidomide Treatment Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled study adult subject Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS ) Type 1 . One hundred eighty ( 180 ) subject diagnose unilateral CRPS Type 1 enrol randomize receive orally either 10 mg/day lenalidomide placebo ( 90 subject per treatment arm ) . For subject , study consist three phase : Pre-randomization Phase ( 2 week ) , Treatment Phase ( 12 week ) Extension Phase subject opportunity receive lenalidomide treatment long benefit derive drug . Subjects complete 12 week treatment phase may eligible receive lenalidomide extension phase . Subject may continue extension phase long benefit derive drug .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; = 18 year time signing informed consent form Understand voluntarily sign informed consent form A diagnosis CRPS Type 1 , define modify International Association Study Pain criterion least oneyear duration . Unilateral involvement distal limb ( hand foot ) without proximal spread must present . In presence upper low limb involvement , severely affected limb designate CRPSaffected limb . Screening : CRPS pain intensity score CRPSaffected limb must least 4 11point ( 010 ) Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale ( PINRS ) . Randomization : Average PINRS score randomization purpose base AM PM assessment make 7 day prior randomization . At least eight PINRS score 7day period require Average PINRS score CRPSaffected limb period must least 4 11point ( 010 ) PINRS . Measurable ( electrophysiology method ) sural , median sensory , median motor peroneal motor nerve screen nerve conduction study . Opioid analgesic , nonopioid analgesic , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug , anticonvulsant , antidepressant drug nondrug therapy may continue provided subject stable doses/regimens least four week prior start Treatment Phase ( Visit 2 ) . Able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . Women childbearing potential ( WCBP ) must agree practice complete abstinence heterosexual intercourse use two method contraception begin 4 week prior start study drug ( Day 1 ) study drug ( include dose interruption ) 4 week last dose study drug . The two method contraception must include one highly effective method ( i.e . intrauterine device [ IUD ] , hormonal [ birth control pill , injection , implant use conjunction lowdose ( 81 mg/day ) aspirin regimen ] , tubal ligation , partner 's vasectomy ) one additional effective ( barrier ) method ( i.e . latex condom , diaphragm , cervical cap ) . If hormonal method ( birth control pill , injection , implant ) IUD medically possible subject , two barrier method acceptable . Women childbearing potential ( WCBP ) must two negative pregnancy test ( sensitivity least 50 mlU/mL ) prior start study drug treatment . The first test perform within 1014 day second within 24 hour start study drug . Once treatment start , recommend subject weekly pregnancy test first 4 week treatment . Thereafter , subject required pregnancy test every 4 week females regular menstrual cycle every 2 week females irregular cycle . Males ( include vasectomy ) must use barrier contraception ( latex condom ) engage reproductive sexual activity WCBP study drug 4 week last dose study drug . The presence follow exclude subject study enrollment : History deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) stroke past 5 year . Documented peripheral neuropathy include diabetic neuropathy metabolic toxic neuropathy . Current sign symptom severe , progressive uncontrolled renal , hepatic , hematological , endocrine , pulmonary , cardiac , neurological cerebral disease . Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject signing informed consent form . White blood cell count ( WBC ) &lt; 3.5*10^9/L screening . Bilirubin , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alkaline phosphatase level two time upper limit normal range screening . Abnormal thyroid function test value screen . Any condition , include presence laboratory abnormality , place subject unacceptable risk he/she participate study confounds ability interpret data study . Use concomitant medication ( ) , could increase risk develop DVT , except steroidbased contraceptive ( oral injectable , implantable ) hormone replacement therapy use conjunction lowdose ( 81 mg/day ) aspirin regimen . Concurrent use thalidomide . Prior development allergic reaction/hypersensitivity take thalidomide . Prior development moderate severe rash desquamation take thalidomide . Prior treatment lenalidomide .</criteria>
