	<brief_summary>This study determine safety side effect two experimental HIV vaccine give `` prime-boost '' schedule . It also monitor participant social impact HIV vaccine study ( e.g. , problem insurance , health care , friend , family , employment , housing , forth ) . The vaccine VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP ( call DNA vaccine ) VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP ( call rAd vaccine ) . The DNA vaccine cod four HIV protein . The rAd vaccine make use adenovirus ( common virus cause upper respiratory infection , common cold ) modify contain DNA cod three HIV protein . These vaccine cause HIV adenoviral infection . The study also see vaccine cause immune response ; injection DNA vaccine give use needle syringe similar safety immune response give needleless injection device call Biojector 2000 ; people already antibodies adenovirus still immune response rAd vaccine ; social harm result participate HIV vaccine study . Healthy volunteer 18 50 year age may eligible 42-week study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test ( include pregnancy test woman ) , question regard sexual behavior practice . Participants receive three injection ( shot ) DNA vaccine one injection rAd vaccine . All injection give muscle upper arm ( alternate right leave arm injection ) , use needle syringe needleless Biojector 2000 . The first vaccination give day enrollment study , DNA vaccination give 4 week apart , minimum 21 day injection . The rAd `` booster '' vaccination give Week 24 . Participants fill diary card home 5 day vaccination , record temperature symptom . They come clinic follow-up 3 day DNA vaccine injection , call return 7 day injection . They call study nurse 1 2 day rAd injection . There 15 18 clinic visit course study . At visit , participant check health change problem . Blood urine sample collect visit . Participants periodically test HIV ask question sexual behavior drug use counsel throughout study HIV risk reduction . They also ask social effect may experience result participation study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I randomize study examine safety tolerability , well immune response , schedule 3 HIV DNA plasmid vaccination follow one HIV adenoviral vector vaccine ( rAd ) booster . The hypothesis : 1 ) regimen safe human administration elicit immune responses HIV-1 ; 2 ) Biojector Needle/Syringe safe use IM injection DNA vaccine 3 ) subject low high pre-existing adenovirus serotype 5 antibody ( Ad5Ab ) titer boost immune response HIV-1 peptide follow Ad booster vaccination . In study equal number subject high low Ad5Ab titer randomize receive DNA vaccination either needle syringe ( N/S ) Biojector receive either 1010 PU 1011 PU rAd booster vaccination factorial design . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability humans prime-boost vaccination regimen . Secondary objective related evaluation immunogenicity DNA vaccine administer N/S Biojector , immunogenicity Ad vaccine two different dos subject high low pre-enrollment titer Ad5Ab , development adenovirus serotype 5 neutralize antibody social impact participate HIV-1 vaccine trial . Exploratory evaluation immunogenicity prime-boost regimen also plan . The preliminary result may serve basis design study provide definitive answer question method administration effect pre-enrollment Ad5Ab titer safety immune response rAd booster vaccination . Product Description : VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP compose 6 close , circular DNA plasmid 16.67 % ( weight ) vaccine . Each 6 plasmid vaccine express single gene product . Plasmids VRC 4401 , VRC 4409 VRC 4404 design express clade B HIV-1 Gag , Pol Nef , respectively . VRC 5736 , VRC 5737 , VRC 5738 design express HIV-1 Env glycoprotein clade A , clade B , clade C , respectively . Vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL . DNA vaccination 1 mL vaccine administer intramuscularly use either N/S Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System . VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP recombinant product compose four non-replicating adenoviral vector ( 3:1:1:1 ratio ) code HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyproteins clade B HIV-1 Env glycoproteins clades A , B , C. All rAd injection administer N/S . Subjects : Forty healthy adult volunteer , 18 50 year old ; 20 subject low Ad5Ab ( 1:500 ) 20 subject high Ad5Ab ( great 1:500 ) . Study Plan : Forty subject randomize 1:1 ratio receive vaccination schedule two different method intramuscular administration ( N/S Biojector ) , show schema . The rAd boost also randomize either 1010 PU 1011 PU 1:1 ratio . The rAd boost dosage blind 6 week safety immunogenicity evaluation rAd boost complete subject .</detailed_description>
