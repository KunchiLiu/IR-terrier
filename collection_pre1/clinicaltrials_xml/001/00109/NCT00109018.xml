	<brief_summary>Biomarkers Cardiovascular Disease Summary : This study examine function line cell blood vessel measure substances blood see relate various blood test , include new test development determine cardiovascular disease risk . Nitric oxide molecule produce healthy blood vessel help keep relaxed . Nitrate substance form nitric oxide blood . The release nitric oxide blood vessel reduce patient coronary artery disease , compare healthy people . Also , blood nitrite level rise patient . Other substance blood urine also change risk heart disease . This study measure nitrite level inflammatory substance blood urine . Healthy volunteer , people various risk factor heart disease , people blockage one major heart arteries history heart attack may eligible study . Candidates must 21 year age old . People irregular heart rhythm take oral nitrate exclude . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Blood test : Samples draw three time routine test look certain protein may affect heart . Samples collect test , start exercise stress test ( see ) stress test . - Urine test : A sample may test protein urine research study . - Brachial artery reactivity study : This ultrasound study test well person 's artery widen . The subject rest bed . An ultrasound measuring device place artery elbow . The size artery blood flow measure inflating pressure cuff around forearm . The pressure cuff stop flow blood arm 5 minute release ultrasound picture take . After subject rest , nitroglycerin tablet ( medicine cause blood vessel relax ) place tongue . After nitroglycerin give , size artery blood flow measure . After rest period , study repeat healthy volunteer first 20 patient heart disease . - Echocardiography ( heart ultrasound ) : This test involve hold small probe chest use sound wave obtain picture heart . A small catheter ( plastic tube ) may place vein inject contrast agent enhance picture . - Metabolic stress testing : Subjects ask breathe mask baseline measurement take . Then exercise treadmill wear breathe mask . This test show much oxygen body use rest exercise . - Genetic testing ( optional ) : A blood sample collect examine DNA - genetic material determines inherit trait contains information body proteins . Some part DNA may use marker level damage produce oxygen by-product may reflect extent heart disease patient . Also , gene variation may make individual likely develop heart problem . Such marker may guide doctor predict fast disease progress may help find new type drug prevent disease . - Time requirement : This study expect take approximately 5-6 hour completion within one two day . - Follow-up : Patients contact phone every 6 month information chest pain , surgical procedure related heart , hospitalization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular event major cause morbidity mortality world-wide traditional risk factor assessment limit ability predict patient event . The endothelium know play central role vascular homeostasis nitric oxide ( NO ) believe main component responsible normal endothelial function . Increasing evidence suggest oxidative stress lead reduce NO bioavailability subsequent endothelial dysfunction important factor progression vascular disease . Further investigation NO metabolites blood may provide insight mechanism endothelial dysfunction disease progression . Preliminary data suggest although plasma nitrite level decrease CAD patient correlate endothelial dysfunction , nitrite within red blood cell whole blood compensatorily increase . Since new measure reproducible convenient measure , may serve biomarker endothelial dysfunction . A prospective study nitrite novel NO-based assay , proteomics , current biomarkers link endothelial function phenotype allow investigation pathophysiology endothelial dysfunction permit development future marker atherothrombosis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Adults old 21 , sex : The initial study group consist 120 subject , consist 100 subject document CAD ( cardiac catheterization show great equal 70 % stenosis epicardial vessel ) , previously document MI ( base ECG cardiac enzyme ) CAD risk equivalent ( diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , abdominal aortic aneurysm , symptomatic carotid disease , multiple risk factor confer 10 year risk great 20 % define Framingham Risk Score ) 20 healthy age sexmatched control . Written informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Atrial fibrillation Any contraindication oral nitrate Hypotension , bradycardia . Myocardial infarction within prior 30 day Symptoms acute CHF Pregnant woman Receiving active treatment cancer Any condition may interfere interpretation study result best interest subject opinion investigator . Since oral nitrate therapy know affect serum possibly whole blood nitrite level , exclude patient longacting nitrate initial group 100 cardiac patient . Those patient chronic nitrate therapy subsequently include late portion study analyze separately .</criteria>
