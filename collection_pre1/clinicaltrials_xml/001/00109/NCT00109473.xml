	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether take growth hormone ( GH ) drug call somatropin cause intestine person Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) heal faster compare person Crohn 's Disease receive growth hormone drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Growth Hormone Therapy Pediatric Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal treatment goal childhood CD include : 1 ) clinical remission conjunction mucosal heal 2 ) restoration normal growth development . Current therapy case include induction remission corticosteroid follow maintenance remission 6-mercaptopurine ( 6-MP ) mesalamine . With approach , goal achieve mucosal heal normalization growth achieve significant number child . GH therapy use several chronic childhood disease complicate growth failure despite adequate GH secretion . These include chronic renal failure ( CRF ) , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ( JRA ) , Turner 's syndrome . However , despite comparable frequency magnitude permanent growth failure , efficacy GH therapy respect yet determine control trial CD . Moreover , whether GH therapy may also directly reduce disease activity promote intestinal healing know . This represent significant clinically unmet need patient population . Therefore , new therapeutic approach need improve final adult height enhance intestinal mucosal heal child CD . The primary objective study determine effect growth hormone ( GH ) therapy upon colon mucosal heal 12 week randomize trial child Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) . Children active CD randomize GH + prednisone ( GP ) prednisone alone ( P ) 12 week period . This study also involve 52 week extension phase participant meet eligibility give opportunity take continue take growth hormone 52 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability provide write informed consent Age ≥ 5 year . Diagnosis Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ileocolonic involvement determine standard clinical , radiological , pathological criterion . Moderate severely active CD define PCDAI ( Pediatric Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ) ≥ 30 . Currently take Prednisone Budesonide start dose ( taper ) May continue stable dos AZA/6MP , methotrexate , and/or mesalamine entry . For 52 week extension , baseline bone age ≤ 12 year girls ≤ 13 year boys . For 52 week extension phase , remission mild Crohn 's disease determine PCDAI &lt; 30 . Acute critical illness Active neoplasia Diabetes mellitus History intracranial lesion and/or neoplasia Severe disease require hospitalization treatment Current therapy infliximab may independently rapidly reduce clinical disease activity promote mucosal healing Use prednisone budesonide taper phase Family history colorectal cancer age 50 Personal familial history familial polyposis syndrome Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) prior randomization Any condition investigator believe would pose significant hazard subject investigational therapy initiate Participation another simultaneous medical investigation trial Pediatric IBD ( Inflammatory Bowel Disease ) registry</criteria>
