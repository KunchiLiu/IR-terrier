	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , decitabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Valproic acid may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving decitabine together valproic acid may effective treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . This phase I trial study side effect best dose decitabine valproic acid treat patient relapsed refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine With Without Valproic Acid Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine minimally effective pharmacological dose ( MEPD ) single-agent decitabine patient relapse refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . II . Determine maximum tolerate dose valproic acid administer MEPD decitabine patient . III . Determine MEPD valproic acid administer decitabine patient . IV . Determine toxic effect decitabine alone combination valproic acid patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient treat drug . II . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment stage . STAGE 1 : Patients receive decitabine IV 1 hour day 1-5 1-10 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . STAGE 2 : Patients receive decitabine stage 1 valproic acid orally ( PO ) thrice daily ( TID ) day 5-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . For stage , patient achieve objective response ( complete response [ CR ] , unconfirmed CR , partial response ) may discontinue study treatment undergo stem cell transplantation , eligible . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 18-42 patient ( 18 stage 1 24 stage 2 ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
