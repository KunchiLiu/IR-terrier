	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well radiofrequency ablation work treat patient stage IA non-small cell lung cancer . Radiofrequency ablation use high-frequency electric current kill tumor cell . Computed tomography ( CT ) -guided radiofrequency ablation may better treatment non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation Treating Patients With Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall 2-year survival rate radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess freedom regional distant recurrence . II . To assess freedom local recurrence ablate lobe . III . To estimate number procedure deem technical success . IV . To evaluate procedure-specific morbidity mortality . V. To explore utility immediate ( within 96 hour ) post-RFA positron emission tomography ( PET ) predict overall survival local control . VI . To explore effect RFA short-term ( 3 month post-RFA ) long-term ( 24 month post-RFA ) pulmonary function . OUTLINE : A radiofrequency electrode place CT guidance target tumor . Patients undergo RFA directly tumor 12 minute obtain intratumoral temperature &gt; 60Â° Celsius ( C ) . Patients may receive 3 RFA treatment ( total 36 minute ) obtain target temperature . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
