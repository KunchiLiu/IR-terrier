	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect anti-HIV drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) lipid level HIV infect adult stable anti-HIV drug therapy . Study hypothesis : The addition TDF stable background antiretroviral therapy HIV infect individual dyslipidemia result reduction non-HDL 12 week treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Lipid Levels HIV Infected Adults Stable Anti-HIV Drug Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) result significant reduction morbidity mortality among HIV infect people . However , significant adverse effect , include dyslipidemia , associate HAART . Dyslipidemia may cause elevation serum total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , triglyceride concentration , well decrease high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) concentration . Dyslipidemia particular concern patient receive HAART condition associate increase risk cardiovascular event . TDF antiretroviral exhibit favorable lipid effect several study HIV infect people , mechanism observe lipid-lowering effect TDF unknown . This study evaluate efficacy TDF lower non-HDL HIV infect adult currently stable HAART . HAART provide study . This study last 32 week . Participants randomly assign one two study arm . Arm A participant receive 12 week TDF daily , 4 week TDF , 12 week placebo daily , 4 week TDF . Arm B participant receive 12 week placebo daily , 4 week TDF , 12 week TDF daily , 4 week TDF . Participants continue take currently prescribe stable HAART regimen duration study . There 13 study visit 32 week study . Clinical assessment occur visit ; blood urine collection occur visit .</detailed_description>
