	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine 3 different anti-HIV drug regimen give HIV infect pregnant woman pregnancy effective reduce incidence nevirapine ( NVP ) resistance mutation . Blood level NVP lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) also study . Study hypothesis : NVP resistance follow single-dose NVP prevent concomitant administration additional antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Incidence Nevirapine Resistance Mutations Pregnant HIV Infected Women Who Receive Anti-HIV Drugs Prior After Giving Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single dose nevirapine ( SD-NVP ) give HIV infect pregnant woman labor follow single dose infant show simple effective mean reduce mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) HIV among woman receive antiretroviral ( ART ) pregnancy . However , development NVP nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) -resistant virus concern . An optimal ART regimen prevent selection resistant virus efficiently prevent MTCT need . This study evaluate 3 different ART strategy prevent development NVP resistance HIV infect pregnant woman compare incidence NVP resistance mutation postpartum observed regimen incidence among historical control . NVP LPV/r pharmacokinetics ( PK ) also evaluate study . Participants randomly assign one three study arm . All study participant receive single dose oral NVP onset labor , oral zidovudine ( ZDV ) onset labor , every three hour labor . Arm A : ( LPV/r x 7d ) participant receive enteric-coated didanosine ( ddI ) LPV/r orally twice daily begin onset labor continue 7 day postpartum ; oral ZDV also take twice daily 7 day postpartum . Arm B : ( LPV/r ) participant receive enteric-coated ddI begin onset labor continue 30 day postpartum ; oral ZDV also take twice daily 30 day postpartum . Arm C : ( LPV/r x 30d ) participant receive enteric-coated ddI LPV/r orally twice daily begin onset labor continue 30 day postpartum ; oral ZDV also take twice daily 30 day postpartum . All woman follow least 24 week postpartum . Women resistance mutation identify within 8 week postpartum follow 72 week postpartum evaluate persistence mutation . All infant follow least 12 week age . HIV-infected infant follow 24 week age . There 11 study visit woman day 10 , 21 , 30 week 5 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 72 . Medical history assessment , physical exam , blood collection occur visit . Blood collection PK study occur Days 10 , 21 , 30 . All woman ask complete adherence questionnaire Day 10 ; woman assign Arms A : LPV/r x 7d B : LPV/r also ask complete adherence questionnaire Day 30 . There 6 study visit infant birth - 48 hour , day 21 , week 5 , 12 , 16 24 . Medical history assessment physical exam occur visit ; blood collection occur visit . Data specimens historical control comparison group obtain PHPT-2 trial* , five P1032 study site participate 2001 2003 . PHPT-2 study efficacy SD-NVP prevent MTCT among woman receive ZDV 27 week gestation postpartum ART . Criteria inclusion historical comparison group include receipt SD-NVP , CD4 count 250 cell per cubic millimeter within 30 day screen entry , availability plasma sample 10 day 6 week post-partum . * Lallement M , Jourdain G , Le Coeur S , et al .
