	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide topotecan , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give temozolomide together topotecan work treat patient primary CNS lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Topotecan Treating Patients With Primary CNS Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine complete radiologic response rate patient primary CNS lymphoma treat salvage chemotherapy comprise temozolomide topotecan . Secondary - Determine median failure-free survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine overall response rate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 topotecan IV 30 minute daily day 2-6 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6-8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 6-25 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
