	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Tolerability Tyrosine Adsorbed Ragweed Pollen Allergoid With MPL ( Monophosphoryl Lipid A )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RagweedMATAMPL ( tyrosine adsorb ragweed pollen allergoid monophosphoryl lipid A ( MPL® ) ) develop provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy patient prove type I hypersensitivity ragweed pollen . MPL ( Monophosphoryl Lipid A ) , purify , detoxify glycolipid derive cell wall Salmonella minnesota , include product formulation adjuvant increase immunogenic effect product enhance switch allergen-specific TH2 TH1-like profile . The ragweed pollen extract modify glutaraldehyde produce active ingredient , allergoid . This modification reduce reactivity extract IgE antibody , thus reduce risk side effect . However , simultaneous reduction important immunological property , IgG T cell reactivity see . This phase I , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety tolerability RagweedMATAMPL healthy volunteer . Fifteen ( 15 ) volunteer randomize receive 4 subcutaneous injection either increase dos RagweedMATAMPL Placebo 7 day interval .</detailed_description>
