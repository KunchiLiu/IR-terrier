	<brief_title>Cool.Click™ Adolescent Transition Study : Study Saizen® Subjects With Childhood-onset Growth Hormone Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase IIIb , prospective , multicenter , randomise , open label study determine safety efficacy two different dose regimen r-hGH dose escalation scheme . Screening assessment must complete 30 day prior SD1 ( Study Day 1 ) . Eligible subject age 13 25 year randomise equal allocation 1:1 ratio one two treatment group ( 30 subjects/group ) . Daily subcutaneous injection self-administered receive designated individual use cool.click™ , needle-free growth hormone ( GH ) delivery device . The study consist three period : screening ( 30 day prior Study Day 1 ) , active treatment ( 24 week ) , follow-up ( 4 week safety evaluation last dose study medication ) . Each subject require complete daily treatment diary ass dose compliance , adverse event , concomitant medication . Each subject receive one treatment diary SD1 , week 8 , 12 , 24 . Subjects require record daily diary entry capture dose compliance , adverse event , concomitant medication . Depending upon treatment allocation subject tolerability , dose titration increase follow : - Group A : 0.005 mg/kg/day 30 day increase , Investigator 's approval , 0.010 mg/kg/day day 31 week 24 . - Group B : 0.010 mg/kg/day 14 day opportunity dose escalate , Investigator 's approval , day 15 0.02 mg/kg/day day 29 0.03 mg/kg/day . Scheduled study visit include screen , baseline , week 8 , 12 , 24 . Dosage adjustment base subject tolerability telephone assessment study drug initiation week 6 . Trunk fat measure SD1 , week 12 24 ( early termination visit ) . Routine clinical laboratory assessment ( hematology , blood chemistry , urinalysis ) perform pre-treatment ( -30 -1 SD1 ) post-treatment week 24 ( early termination visit ) . Special laboratory assessment include central analysis lipid panel , fast insulin , fast glucose , insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) , insulin-like growth factor bind protein 3 ( IGFBP-3 ) , free thyroxine ( T4 ) , total T4 , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . Physical exam perform screening , week 12 24 . Safety evaluation occur schedule study visit , telephone assessment , review adverse event concomitant event subject treatment diary .</detailed_description>
