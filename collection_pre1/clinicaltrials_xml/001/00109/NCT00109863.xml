	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , hu14.18-interleukin-2 fusion protein , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well hu14.18-interleukin-2 fusion protein work treat patient advanced melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hu14.18-Interleukin-2 Fusion Protein Treating Patients With Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine clinical antitumor activity hu14.18-interleukin-2 fusion protein patient advance melanoma . - Determine duration response patient treated drug . Secondary - Determine adverse event patient treated drug . - Determine vivo immunologic activation patient treat drug . - Determine induction anti-hu14.18 anti-interleukin-2 antibody patient treated drug . - Determine tumor antigen recognition drug select patient cutaneous metastatic tumor , measure binding drug cutaneous metastatic tumor microscopic change ( include immune cell density phenotype ) tumor tissue . OUTLINE : Patients receive hu14.18-interleukin-2 fusion protein IV 4 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence symptomatic disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo disease reassessment . Patients objective partial complete clinical response stable disease receive 2 additional course treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-30 patient accrue study within 7-15 month .</detailed_description>
