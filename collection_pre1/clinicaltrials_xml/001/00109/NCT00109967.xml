	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give CCI-779 together rituximab work treat patient relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , CCI-779 , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving CCI-779 together rituximab may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CCI-779 Rituximab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall response rate patient relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma treat CCI-779 rituximab . II . Determine tolerability regimen patient assess toxicity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine time disease progression overall survival patient treat regimen . II . Determine duration response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord prior response rituximab ( sensitive [ partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) last ≥ 6 month last treatment rituximab alone combination chemotherapy ] v refractory [ stable progressive disease OR PR CR last &lt; 6 month last treatment rituximab alone combination chemotherapy ] ) . Patients receive CCI-779 IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Patients also receive rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 day 1 course 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion course 3 , patient undergo reevaluation . Patients achieve CR unconfirmed CR ( CRu ) receive 2 additional course treatment total 5 course . Patients achieve PR stable disease continue study treatment outline 12 course . Patients achieve PR stable disease subsequently achieve CR CRu course 3 10 receive 2 additional course treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
