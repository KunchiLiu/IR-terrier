	<brief_title>Hypertonic Saline 75 % v Mannitol 20 %</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Raised intracranial pressure occur follow expansion intracranial mass e.g . hematoma brain tumor leave untreated , lead brain ischemia , stroke death . Strategies reduce raise intracranial pressure include hyperventilation , use hyperosmolar agent evacuation intracranial mass . The two hypertonic solution commonly use Mannitol 20 % Hypertonic Saline 7.5 % . During elective neurosurgical removal brain tumour , anesthesiologist need reduce intracranial pressure provide good operating brain condition avoid brain ischemia . Currently , Mannitol 20 % routinely use intra-operatively patient reduce brain bulk intracranial pressure improve brain operating condition . However , Mannitol cause secondary effect deleterious neurological patient . Mannitol cause diuresis may lead systemic hypovolemia hypotension , adverse change serum urinary sodium , potassium osmolarity . Experience Hypertonic saline 7.5 % , mainly brain injured patient either Emergency Dept Intensive care set . There grow evidence Hypertonic saline 7.5 % effective Mannitol 20 % reduce raise intracranial pressure , especially traumatic brain injury become widely accepted form treatment . One advantage Hypertonic saline cause diuresis therefore less likely cause hypotension hypovolemia . While transient hypernatremia observe administration hypertonic saline , clinical consequence . Unfortunately two study compare effectiveness Hypertonic saline Mannitol elective brain surgery . One , Gemma et al , fail demonstrate difference reduction brain bulk Mannitol Hypertonic saline . However 2 solution use different osmolarities may confound effect result . In study ( publish Polish ) , author find 20 % reduction brain bulk favour hypertonic saline . In view two opposing finding , feel another investigation warrant .</detailed_description>
