	<detailed_description>Recently , FDA EMEA provide recommendation sponsor concern design , conduct , analysis interpretation clinical study assess potential delaying cardiac repolarisation . This paper recommend perform ‘ Qt/QTc ’ study expand ECGs safety evaluation later stag drug development . It recomended study randomize , blind placebo control . Moreover , high sensitivy necessary order detect difference QTc measure , essential positive control include . On basis , positive control well-characterized consistently produce effect correspond large change QT/QTc interval currently view clinically important detect ( mean change around 5 ms. Because , decide select positive control : moxifloxacin , use similar phase I clinical trial . In type study , recommend guideline , caracterization ensure dose-response generally concentration-response relationship QT/QTc prolongation , include exploration concentration higher achieve follow therapeutic dos . So , thererfore , decide use 100 mg/daY ( 10 time therapeutic dose ) supratherapeutic dose administer . We decide propose new phase I study recommend guideline ( single-blind , randomise , placebo active-controlled , parallel design ) . With , ’ tried complet rupatadine effect QTc another electrocardiographic parameter value risk-benefit relationship new antiH1 PAF antagonist single</detailed_description>
