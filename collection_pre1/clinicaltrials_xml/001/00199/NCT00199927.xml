	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION End stage renal disease ( ESRD ) rapidly grow worldwide cost provide ESRD care soon outstrip available resource . In addition poor quality life , patient ESRD 10 20 timer high mortality age- , race- gender-matched healthy control , &gt; 50 % excess burden attributable cardiovascular risk . Thus , prevent limit progression chronic nephropathy , may serve limit incidence ESRD , also excess cardiovascular complication associate chronic renal disease . Several data available proteinuria important determinant progression ESRD risk factor increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Drugs , Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme inhibitor ( ACEi ) Angiotensin II receptor antagonist ( ATA ) , decrease proteinuria also reno- cardio-protective long-term.The combination drug may reduce proteinuria effectively two drug alone . Preliminary data also available statin , addition ameliorate lipid profile may specific renoprotective property , combine ACEi ATA , may synergize antiproteinuric effect experimental model chronic renal disease.Moreover , addition statin antihypertensive treatment without inhibitor renin-angiotensin system additive effect reduce proteinuria also humans.Whether also humans combine statin ACEi ATA may reduce proteinuria effectively ACEi ATA alone therefore worth investigate . AIMS Primary - To assess whether statin combine ACEi ATA effectively ACEi ATA alone reduce urinary protein excretion rate chronic proteinuric nephropathy . Secondary - To assess effect statin combine ACEi ATA vs. combination ACEi ATA alone outcome variable include urinary protein/creatinine ratio , glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , lipid profile , subgroup endothelial function . - To evaluate correlation multivariate analysis relationship baseline /follow-up covariates outcome variable study group whole within treatment group . - To assess treatment tolerability DESIGN This prospective , randomize , parallel group study , follow 2 month Wash-out period previous treatment ( ) ACEi , ATA , potassium spar diuretic statin , patient enter two-month Run-In phase renin angiotensin system ( RAS ) inhibitor therapy ( ACE inhibition benazepril one month ACE inhibition plus angiotensin II antagonism combine treatment benazepril valsartan one month ) . At completion Run-in period baseline evaluation , patient randomize six-month Treatment period without fluvastatin . Regardless randomization group , patient offer optimal conservative treatment include optimal blood pressure control ( systolic/diastolic blood pressure &lt; 130/80 mmHg ) life-style recommendation stop smoking control protein sodium intake . 180 patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
