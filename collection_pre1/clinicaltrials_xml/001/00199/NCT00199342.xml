	<detailed_description>This open label study consist two part . Part I , Phase I component study , conduct single center , enroll 18 patient histologically document Stage IV melanoma ( per American Joint Committee Cancer [ AJCC ] criterion ) currently amenable surgical resection therapy . A specified premedication regimen consist ranitidine , diphenhydramine , dexamethasone administer patient 30 minute prior infusion dose KW-2871 . Planned dose KW-2871 60 mg/m2 , 80 mg/m2 , 100 mg/m2 After identification MTD , 30 patient enrol dose level Part II study . If MTD identify treatment 100 mg/m2 dose level , dose administer Part II study 100 mg/m2 . If MTD determine 60 mg/m2 , study close patient accrual proceed Part II .</detailed_description>
