	<brief_summary>The purpose study see antibody ( cG250 ) attach radioactive substance ( Iodine-124 ) safely detect clear cell renal cancer patient kidney tumor schedule surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study With Antibody , cG250 , Isotope , 124-Iodine , Diagnose Patients With Renal Masses .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antibodies blood protein make immune system . They fight thing body see foreign , bacteria virus . The body also see cancer cell foreign . When body see foreign invader , send antibody tag invader . Once happen , immune system work destroy whatever antibody tag . Monoclonal antibody one make lab . They tag portion cancer cell . Early monoclonal antibody make antibody grown mouse . They cause antibody response humans one dose . Now like human antibody , thus , produce reaction repeat dos . These call chimeric antibody . The antibody use study call chimeric G250 ( cG250 ) . Recent research show antibody attach cancer cell , bind normal cell . This could help cancer treatment two way . One body 's immune system might work destroy tagged cancer cell . The attach chemotherapy drug radioactive chemical antibody . These deliver treatment antibody attach cancer cell . This study do test tag ability cG250 cancer cell . After receive cG250 , scan . The picture scan produce show antibody collect inside body . From , possible measure well cG250 detect kidney cancer . This NOT treatment renal cancer . After surgery , examine tumor tissue see much antibody attach tumor . Fifty four patient expect treated study .</detailed_description>
