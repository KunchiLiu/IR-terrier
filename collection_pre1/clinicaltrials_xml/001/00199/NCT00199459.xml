	<brief_summary>Urinary protein level routinely measure stone patient strong evidence protein play role etiology stone . The purpose study examine urinary serum proteins stone former compare healthy subject utilizing high throughput method , Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization ( SELDI ) . We hypothesize unique set protein express serum urine stone patient detect SELDI . Ultimately , good understand stone disease help develop new prevention strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proteomic Study Urinary Stone Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary stone disease affect 10 % Canadian population lifetime approximately half patient another episode within ten year . Currently , patient undergo metabolic testing ( serum 24 hour urine test ) identify modifiable risk factor ; however , modifiable risk factor identify many patient , yet continue form stone . New technique must develop identify stone patient risk future recurrence ultimately develop specific prevention strategy . Urinary protein level routinely measure stone patient strong evidence protein play role etiology stone . The purpose study examine urinary serum proteins stone former compare healthy subject utilizing high throughput method , Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization ( SELDI ) . We hypothesize unique set protein express serum urine stone patient detect SELDI . Once protein identified biomarker , specific assay similar quick affordable dipstick test may develop identify stone patient risk future stone . Ultimately , good understand stone disease help develop new prevention strategy . Comparisons : protein profile ( serum/urine ) stone patient presence stone 6 week pass . comparison stone profile stone patient control ( non-forming stone patient ) .</detailed_description>

Cystine stone , xanthinuria ) Medullary sponge kidney , renal anomaly horseshoe kidney GI disorder : Inflammatory bowel disease , short bowel Hypercalcemic disorder ( hyperparathyroidism , sarcoidosis , Paget 's disease ) Renal tubular acidosis Immunodeficient patient e.g . HIV ( indinavir stone ) Unable provide inform consent Anyone opinion investigator would inappropriate Controls : In addition criterion ... .. persistent thiazide use Family history stone ( exclude genetic factor since positive family history increase risk urolithiasis )</criteria>
