	<brief_summary>Acumulating data suggest thrapeutic drug therapeutic may optimize efficacity tolerance MMF . It could guarantee good exposure drug first 3 month minimize side effect long term . However definitive proof still lack . We conduct randomize study 11 french center include 137 kidney transplant recipient ( PRA &lt; 50 % ) receive classical immunosuppressant regimen basiliximab , Csa , MMF steroid . The `` fixed dose '' group receive 2 g MMF day . The `` concentration control '' group receive MMF dose adapt area concentration curve ( AUC ) MPA , target 40 h.mg/L . After transplantation AUCs calculate Bayesian estimator use 3-point limited sampling strategy day 7 , 14 , month 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 group ( value note communicate physician `` fix dose '' group .</brief_summary>
