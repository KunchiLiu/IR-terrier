	<brief_summary>This phase 1 study carry Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center . Patients receive radiolabeled antibody , call Yttrium-90 chimeric G250 ( 90Y-cG250 ) .The goal phase 1 trial establish safe dose range base side effect ; study , side effect reversible last short time ( hour day ) . If possible , trial also give u idea well drug might work treat disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Patients With Advanced Renal Cancer With Radio-labeled Antibody , Yttrium-90 Conjugated Chimeric G250</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I dose escalation study use 90Y-DOTA-cG250 treatment patient advance kidney carcinoma . The initial group patient treat 0.2 mCi/Kg yttrium-90 . Subsequent treatment 0.1 mCi/Kg increment , last cohort increase 0.05 mCi/Kg . At least three patient per dose level follow 8 week ( recovery toxicity ) imaging , biochemical , serological , hematologic test toxicity . CT scan carry baseline 6-8 week ( recovery toxicity ) . Patients initially receive 5 mCi/10 mg 111In-DOTA-cG250 antibody ( image dose ) . Whole body blood measurement radioactivity obtain least three occasion one week determine target dosimetry . Therapeutic 90Y-DOTA-cG250 administer follow week , evidence In-111 cG250 target lesion &gt; 2 cm detect CT . Patients treat outpatient receive one treatment .</detailed_description>
