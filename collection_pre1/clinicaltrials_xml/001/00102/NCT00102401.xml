	<brief_summary>The overall goal study compare impact new Internet Dyspnea Self-Management Program ( eDSMP ) establish face-to-face Dyspnea Self-Management Program ( DSMP ) patient COPD . The primary aim study test follow two hypothesis : 1 . The eDSMP DSMP comparable improvement primary outcome shortness breath ( dyspnea ) activity daily live ( ADL ) , exercise adherence performance , pulmonary exacerbation ( frequency duration ) 3 6 month . 2 . The eDSMP DSMP comparable improvement secondary outcome perception support , self-efficacy exercise manage dyspnea , health resource utilization 3 6 month . This study randomize , longitudinal , repeated measure design measurement time 0 , 3 , 6 month .</brief_summary>
