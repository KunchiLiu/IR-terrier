	<brief_summary>This study evaluate child allergy collect medical data biological specimen periodically learn disease gain information may useful develop new treatment . Patients 6 month 18 year age possible diagnosis asthma , rhinitis , anaphylaxis , hive , atopic dermatitis , food allergy , sting insect allergy , allergic inflammatory disease may eligible study . Biological parent patient may also enrol provide blood sample genetic study . Participants undergo test appropriate diagnosis management allergy . They include test outline , necessary , additional blood test , tissue biopsy ( surgical removal small piece tissue microscopic examination ) , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . - Pulmonary function test : This test evaluate lung function . The patient blow hard tube attach machine measure airflow lung . At home , patient use small plastic device call peak flow meter measure lung function . Patients whose lung function measure less 80 percent value predict age may give medicine albuterol see lung function improve . - Skin prick testing : Drops 55 different allergen ( foreign substance , pollen certain food medicine cause reaction like sneeze , hive , eczema , others ) place back arm . The skin allergen scratch pointed tool . If person allergic , skin around scratch develop small area itching , redness , swell go away 30 60 minute . - Acoustic rhinometry : To learn effect allergy size nasal cavity , nasal canal size measure place small round probe nostril . The device send receive sound wave signal size nasal canal calculate , record store graphically computer screen . The procedure repeat three time nostril . - Computerized assessment learn mood : Patients age 10 older may take computer test find allergy affect learn mood . The test measure child 's ability understand direction , solve problem , remember thing . It also include question child feel general . - Behavioral assessment system child : Patients age 8 older may take true/false questionnaire ass mood . - Blood may draw follow purpose : lieu skin prick test determine sensitivity allergen ; look reason severity cause allergy ; research study immune system , include marker allergy ; genetic test determine inherit factor increase risk develop allergy . Patients schedule follow-up visit base diagnosis severity illness . Most patient return within one month first study visit , general , month allergy severe , every month stable . Visits include updated history physical examination , blood test , possibly test described . Patients may also intradermal skin testing , allergen use skin prick test injected forearm upper arm surface skin . Patients test positive allergen may offer standard treatment allergy shot .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atopic disorder , include limited asthma , rhinitis , anaphylaxis , urticaria , atopic dermatitis , food allergy , sting insect allergy exceedingly common pediatric population . The impact disorder health , educational social activity cost medical care profound widespread . In order understand disease improve therapy , study pediatric allergy justifiably important health priority goal protocol . This purpose foster follow objective : 1 ) To gather database clinical immunological data well clinically immunologically characterize disease onset , progression remittance disorder ; 2 ) foster collaborative study pediatric allergic disease institution 3 ) provide cohort pediatric patient resident NIH Clinical Center/NIAID Allergy Immunology train program . Up 500 new patient enrol attain goal . Patients undergo screen history , physical examination , clinical laboratory evaluation accord standard practice community . Although image study tissue biopsy perform clinically indicate , blood sample cellular biochemical study may collect research purpose . Treatment plan individualized patient number length additional visit diagnostic evaluation vary accordingly . Standard immunotherapy allergic disease may offer . Through assessment , analysis , treatment large cohort patient , good understand disease manifestation , trend , outcome , mechanism pediatric allergy lay groundwork discovery new therapeutic modality .</detailed_description>
