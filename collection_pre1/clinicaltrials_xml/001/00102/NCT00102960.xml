	<brief_title>Anti-HIV Drugs Treating Infants Who Acquired HIV Infection Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In South Africa , estimate 250,000 infant bear HIV-infected mother year . A high percentage perinatal HIV infection due inadequate absent mother-to-child transmission prophylaxis . Unfortunately , even optimal prophylaxis , relatively large number HIV-infected infant continue bear require antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . Determining appropriate time initiate interrupt treatment benefit long-term prognosis infant significant health challenge . Evidence suggest start ART early acute infection provide long-term benefit . However , long duration treatment increase chance develop drug-resistant virus , continuous therapy begin early lead long-term complication child . This study evaluate efficacy two different short-course ART strategies HIV-infected infant South Africa . This study last least 3.5 year . There two part study . In Part A , infant baseline CD4 percentage ( CD4 % ) least 25 % HIV infection diagnose 6 12 week age randomly assign one two treatment strategy arm . Arm 2 infant receive ART approximately 40 week first birthday . Arm 3 infant receive ART approximately 96 week second birthday . Treatment arm Part A begin first-line , continuous treatment zidovudine , lamivudine , lopinavir/ritonavir . Those initially deferred treatment Arm 1 reassess initiation first-line , continuous ART . In Part B , infant baseline CD4 % le 25 % receive continuous ART . First-line ART start Arm 1 restart interruption Arms 2 3 appropriate criterion define protocol meet . First-line treatment zidovudine , lamivudine , lopinavir/ritonavir continue infant reach study endpoint ; occurs , infant change second-line therapy . Second-line ART consist didanosine , abacavir sulfate , nevirapine efavirenz . Follow-up visit take place 3.5 6 year , depend time enrollment . All infant receive routine immunization cotrimoxazole ( sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim ) prophylaxis age 6 week Week 40 . Study visit occur study entry , Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 ; every 12 week thereafter . At visit , infant vital sign measurement , physical exam , medical history evaluation . Blood urine collection occur study visit . Infants ' parent guardian also ask complete adherence questionnaire . Participants enrol CIPRA-ZA Project 2 encourage enroll observational substudy organize Wistar Institute ( Dr. Luis Montaner , Principal Investigator ) , conjunction CIPRA team . This study entitle , '' Pediatric Immune Correlates Early Anti-HIV Therapy . '' The goal 5-year substudy evaluate 120 HIV infect child parent study twice year compare HIV uninfected age-matched control . Children evaluate ( ) characterization identification innate adaptive immune reconstitution outcome early ( 9 21 month ) therapy infant infect HIV birth ( b ) identification immune correlate outcome clinical progression within period 2 3 year follow-up stopping therapy .</detailed_description>
