	<brief_summary>HIV infect child adolescent take many anti-HIV drug may limit treatment option high risk progress AIDS . The purpose study determine whether anti-HIV treatment regimen 2 protease inhibitor ( PIs ) 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) effective regimen 4 NRTIs treatment-experienced child adolescent fail previous anti-HIV treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Two Anti-HIV Drug Regimens Youth Who Have Failed Prior Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV infect child adolescent anti-HIV treatment regimen traditionally difficulty non-adherence drug resistance adult , often result virologic failure . Additionally , HIV infect child extensive exposure antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) likely few therapeutic option salvage therapy , physician find difficult choose regimen keep HIV infection control . This study compare efficacy three 4-drug ARV salvage regimens treatment-experienced , HIV infect child adolescent experience virologic failure . This study last least 96 week . Participants randomly assign one three group . Group 1A receive dual-PI base regimen lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) , saquinavir ( SQV ) , NRTIs emtricitabine ( FTC ) abacavir sulfate ( ABC ) . Group 1B receive dual-PI base regimen LPV/r , SQV , FTC , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) . Group 2 receive NRTI-only regimen ABC , lamivudine , zidovudine , TDF . There 11 study visit Step I study . Medical history , physical exam , blood collection occur visit . Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan occur study entry Weeks 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 . Urine collection occur visit ; participant also take part adherence modules visit . Participants ask complete pill count form Weeks 4 24 . Additionally , study participant ask participate intensive pharmacokinetics study Week 4 .</detailed_description>
