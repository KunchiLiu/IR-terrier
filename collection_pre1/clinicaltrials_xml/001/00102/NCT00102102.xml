	<brief_summary>This study examine role substance P , chemical messenger brain , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , chronic anxiety disorder . PTSD develop exposure terrify event ordeal , violent personal assault , natural human-caused disaster , accident , military combat . Substance P peptide may important response certain psychiatric neurological disease condition , include anxiety . Healthy normal volunteer people PTSD 18 65 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination , blood urine test , pregnancy test woman become pregnant , neuropsychological evaluation . Participants undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . An optional lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) also request . PET Scanning PET use small amount radioactive chemical call tracer `` label '' active area brain . The tracer use study [ 18F ] SPA-RQ . For procedure , subject lie still scanner bed . A special mask fit head help keep subject 's head still scan image clear . A 20-minute `` transmission '' scan do radioactive tracer inject provide measure brain help precise calculation information subsequent scan . After tracer inject needle arm , picture take continuously 2 hour . Then , 20- 40-minute image take every hour 5 hour injection . MRI Scanning An MRI scan schedule time within 1 year PET scan . MRI use magnetic field radio wave obtain image body tissue organ . The subject lie still table inside tunnel-like MRI scanner . Earplugs worn muffle loud noise occur scan . The maximum duration scan 60 minute . Lumbar Puncture Lumbar puncture use examine cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) surround brain spinal cord . For procedure , local anesthetic give numb skin lower back area . A small needle insert space bone low back CSF circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . Blood Draw A blood sample collect generate cell line use extract DNA ( genetic material ) gene study freeze future use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Substance P Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) chronic , debilitate disorder place significant burden individual society . Abnormalities serotonergic noradrenergic system dysregulation hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal ( HPA ) axis propose neurobiological mechanism development disorder , however exact underpinnings neurobiology disorder must elucidate . Distribution substance P ( SP ) receptor , neurokinin 1 ( NK1 ) receptor , include region implicate pathophysiology PTSD , namely amygdala , hippocampus , hypothalamus , locus ceruleus . There considerable spatial ( therefore functional ) overlap SP-NK1 receptor system neurotransmitter ( e.g. , norepinephrine , serotonin ) pathways well establish role anxiety . Preclinical study indicate stress regulates level SP several brain region . In addition , several animal model , NK1 receptor antagonist demonstrate anxiolytic-like property . These anxiolytic-like effect seem involve different mechanism currently available anxiolytic . In protocol , use PET ligand act NK1 receptor antagonist , [ 18F ] SPA-RQ ( [ 18F ] -labeled Substance P Antagonist Receptor Quantifier ) . Using tracer , look regional difference NK1 receptor bind 20 patient PTSD 20 healthy control . The goal present study demonstrate involvement SP PTSD , thereby , understand role psychopathology illness .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : PTSD Samples : Twenty subject ( age 1865 ) current PTSD , define DSMIV criterion , ethnicity without significant medical condition select . Healthy Control Samples : Twenty healthy subject ( age 1865 ) without know personal family history psychiatric disorder firstdegree relative select . A control subject match subject PTSD age , gender , handedness , respectively . They must actively use illicit drug engage heavy consumption alcohol , metallic implant ferromagnetic , competent sign consent form participate study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must take antidepressant medication likely alter SPNK1 receptor system . Effective medication discontinue purpose study . Subjects exclude : 1 . DSMIV Axis I diagnostic criterion PTSD Major depression ( All control must meet Axis I diagnose ) ; 2 . DSMIV criterion psychoactive substance abuse/dependence within six month ; 3. take psychotropic medication last 3 week ( 8 week fluoxetine ) ; 4. abnormal MRI minor atrophy ; 5. abnormal laboratory test , include HIV test ; 6. currently pregnant breast feeding ( documented pregnancy test screening day scan ) ; 7. prior participation research protocol within past year radiation exposure together present study would exceed annual limit ( A total effective dose 5.0 rem year 5 rad per year lens eye , gonad bloodforming organ ; 15 rad annually organs ) ; 8. unable lay one 's back PET/MRI scan ( PET MRI scan take approximately 5 1 hour , respectively ) ; 9. condition increase risk MRI ( e.g. , pacemaker , metallic foreign body eye , etc . ) ; 10. individual recently donate blood ; 11. serious suicidal ideation behavior ; 12 . Xylocaine allergy ; 13. positive HIV test . For healthy subject , exclusion criterion b ) ) PTSD subject . As item ) , subject exclude meet current DSMIV Axis I diagnostic criterion .</criteria>
