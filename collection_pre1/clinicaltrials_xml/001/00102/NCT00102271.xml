	<brief_summary>This study examine 1 ) nitrite ( natural blood substance relax blood vessel ) increase blood flow lower blood pressure , 2 ) increase effect nitrite blood pressure . Healthy volunteer 21 40 year age may eligible study . They must non-smokers history high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood test . This study either do NIH Clinical Center intensive care unit general clinical ward . Participants enrol Part A study . After completion Part A participant enrol Part B study . Part A : Participants lie recline chair study . Small catheter ( plastic tube ) insert artery vein forearm . Another tube place vein opposite arm . Blood pressure cuff place around upper arm wrist , strain gauge ( rubber band-like device ) place around forearm . This device help u measure blood flow arm . When blood pressure cuff inflate , blood flow forearm , stretch strain gauge rate proportional blood flow . Pressure cuff strain gauge also place arm . After 20 minute , blood pressure blood flow measure forearm . Then blood drawn tube right vein measure blood count , protein , chemical . Participants give small dos either saline , ascorbic acid , medicine call oxypurinol , form drug often take prevent gout . After 30 minute , sodium nitrite inject increase dos artery 30 minute . Blood flow measure blood drawn every 5 minute infusion . At end 30 minute , blood drawn vein every 30 minute 3 hour . After 3 hour , sodium nitrite infusion restart 2 hour blood flow measure sample collect every 30 minute period . Part B : Participants lie recline chair study . A small catheter ( plastic tube ) place artery leave forearm draw blood sample . A large catheter call central line place deep vein neck . Another tube advance central line chamber heart , heart valve , lung artery measure pressure heart lung . Blood drawn 30 minute obtain baseline measurement . Then saline ( sterile salt water ) put tube lung artery . Blood pressure cuff place around upper arm wrist , strain gauge ( rubber band-like device ) place around forearm , help u measure flow arm . When cuff inflate , blood flow forearm , stretch strain gauge rate proportional blood flow . Pressure cuff strain gauge also place arm . After 20 minute , blood pressure blood flow measure forearm blood sample draw tube leave artery measure blood count , protein , chemical . Subjects breathe mixture oxygen nitrogen facemask 30 minute , room air 30 minute , oxygen nitrogen mixture another 30 minute . While breathe mixture second time , sodium nitrite inject tube artery three increase dos 5 minute . Every 5 minute infusion blood drawn tube neck . Forearm blood flow also measure every 5 minute . After 30 minute , subject breathes room air 3 hour 15 minute sodium nitrite inject three increase dos 5 minute . Every 5 minute infusion blood take tube neck forearm blood flow measure</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although regional synthesis nitric oxide ( NO ) endothelium contribute importantly local vasodilator tone , previously show NO bioactivity may transport blood , biological effect distance site entry circulation . These endocrine effect NO mediate intravascular NO-stores - candidate protein heme-bound NO specie ( RXNO ) plasma erythrocytes oxidative NO-metabolite nitrite . Cumulating evidence suggest nitrite may serve major intravascular storage pool NO . Recent study group show regional , intra-arterial infusion nitrite elicits downstream vasodilator response . The mechanism nitrite reduction vivo may involve number pathway . We observe nitrite reduce NO reaction deoxyheme proteins . This chemistry suggest role hemoglobin heme proteins oxygen dependent nitrite reductase nitrite ion might contribute systemic hypoxic vasodilation . Other research group propose pH-dependent mechanism , involvement electron donor ascorbic acid , xanthinoxidase reduce agent . The present study conduct two stage ( Parts A B ) follow objective : Part A determine 1 ) whether systemic ( intravenous ) infusion nitrite modulates vascular tone systemic circulation , 2 ) whether oxypurinol ( potent inhibitor xanthine oxidase activity ) lower ascorbic acid potentiates nitrite-induced vasodilation , 3 ) elucidate pharmacokinetic profile nitrite application human 4 ) determine phase I data dose nitrite human disease . Part B determine whether systemic pulmonary vascular response nitrite infusion potentiate hypoxic condition mediate NO gas per se measure NO content exhale breath .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY : A total 30 healthy volunteer enrol study , 20 Part A 10 Part B . All volunteer subject undergo screen complete history , cardiovascular physical examination , blood collection clinical chemistry routine analysis , plus test G6PDH deficiency erythrocytes blood gas analysis via cooximetry , pregnancy test . INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must 2140 year age . Subject must good health . Subjects must provide informed , write consent participation study . Female subject childbearing age must negative pregnancy test . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects history evidence present past hypertension ( blood pressure great 140/90 mmHg ) , hypercholesterolemia ( LDL cholesterol great 160 mg/dL ) , diabetes mellitus ( fast blood glucose great 126 mg/dL ) Subjects history smoke within two year Subjects history cardiovascular disease , peripheral vascular disease , coagulopathy , disease predispose vasculitis Raynaud 's phenomenon . Individuals future cardiovascular risk great 1 % next 10 year exclude study . Risk calculate use Framingham risk calculator publish web site : http : //hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/atpiii/calculator.asp ? usertype=prof . Subjects red blood cell G6PD deficiency ( level low limit normal ) . Subjects know cytochrome B5 deficiency participate study . Subjects history reaction medication substance characterize dyspnea cyanosis participate study . Subjects baseline methemoglobin level great 1.9 % receive nitrite infusion . Lactating female participate since nitrite cross breast milk could cause methemoglobinemia infant . No volunteer subject allow take medication ( oral contraceptive agent allow ) , vitamin supplement contain arginine , herbal preparation , nutriceuticals `` alternative therapy '' least one month prior study allow take aspirin one week prior study Subjects blood pressure le 90/60 mmHg MAP ( mean arterial blood pressure ) less 70 study day exclude protocol . Due exposure high dos ascorbic acid protocol calcium oxalate stone former , patient dialysis serious kidney disease , patient hemochromatosis iron overload disease exclude .</criteria>
