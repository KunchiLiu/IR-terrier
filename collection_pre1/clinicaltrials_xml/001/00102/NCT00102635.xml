	<brief_summary>The primary objective study estimate modulation intermediate biological endpoint combination 4-HPR SCH66336 , farnesyl transferase inhibitor ( FTI ) , across 4 randomly assign dose level patient locally advance recurrent head neck cancer . We also assess activity , safety , tolerability side effect 4-HPR/SCH66336 hope establish phase II regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The drug fenretinide retinoid similar vitamin A . It believe fenretinide cause cancer cell die . SCH66336 drug block farnesyl protein transferase ( substance need cancer cell grow ) . It believe SCH66336 may selectively stop cancer cell grow affect normal cell . Both SCH66336 fenretinide take orally must swallow whole ( i.e. , drug may break make swallow easy ) . Individuals take study medication whole mouth enroll study . In study participant receive SCH66336 twice day day 21-day cycle . Participants also take fenretinide twice day Days 1-7 cycle . Before begin treatment , participant complete physical exam , include measurement height , weight , vital sign . Participants blood urine test , chest x-ray , ECG ( heart function test ) . Females able become pregnant must negative blood pregnancy test . In addition , participant neurological exam complete questionnaire night vision . Some individual may need eye exam . Before begin treatment , participant biopsy tumor provide sample buccal mucosa ( inner cheek ) . In biopsy , sample tumor tissue remove large needle . The buccal mucosa sample obtain scrap inside cheek . Participants also extra blood sample ( 2 tablespoon ) drawn . The tumor , buccal mucosa , blood sample obtain research purpose directly benefit participant . During study , physician examine participant least week first cycle treatment . A treatment cycle 3 week . Participants also weekly blood test . After first cycle treatment , participant exams every 3 week . In addition , participant urine test every 3 week , neurological exam first 3 week need , chest x-ray every 3 week . Every 3 month , participant complete questionnaire night vision eye exam , need . While study , individual also participate pharmacokinetic study measure level drug blood . On first day treatment , participant blood sample ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn take fenretinide 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 hour take fenretinide . The participant take first dose SCH66336 blood sample take . Additional blood sample ( 1 teaspoon ) take time Day 7 first treatment cycle Day 1 second treatment cycle . A single blood sample ( 1 teaspoon ) take take study drug Day 7 treatment Cycles 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . Participants biopsies tumor , extra blood test provide buccal mucosa sample Days 7 21 first treatment cycle . These biopsy , cheek scraping , extra blood test research purpose directly benefit participant . Approximately two tablespoon blood draw extra blood test . This blood , buccal mucosa ( cheek ) , tumor tissue study learn treatment drug work body effect . Participants may remain study long respond SCH66336/fenretinide combination long physician feel benefit . After complete treatment , participant contact every 3 month check disease status . Participants come M.D . Anderson clinical evaluation every 3 month period 24 month . Fenretinide form capsule SCH66336 form tablet . Participants take fenretinide capsule mouth twice day seven day row start treatment cycle . Participants take SCH66336 tablet twice day 21 day row cycle . Participants give `` pill diary '' record take study medication many capsule tablet take . Participants bring diary unused medication return clinic check-ups . At begin treatment cycle , participant take drug together least 8 hour apart either high-fat meal glass whole milk . Participants continue take SCH66336 tablet least 8 hour apart meal glass whole milk Days 8-21 treatment cycle . Participants take fenretinide capsule Days 8-21 treatment cycle . While study , participant may drink grapefruit juice . This investigational study . The FDA authorize use drug combination research approve widespread use . About 40 individual take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
