	<brief_title>Bisphosphonate Therapy HIV-Infected Adults With Decreased Bone Mineral Density</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decreased BMD bone loss estimate affect 67.5 % HIV-infected population . HIV-associated bone loss may result antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) , also cause infection . To date , treatment bone loss establish . Before prescribe drug treat bone loss , physicians must take account patient ' already demand ART schedule potential nonadherence . This study evaluate efficacy single IV dose zoledronate , investigational bisphosphonate , treat HIV-associated bone loss . This study last 1 year . Participants randomly assign receive zoledronate placebo study entry ; assign intervention give 20- 30-minute infusion outpatient basis . There 7 study visit : screening , study entry , Week 2 , Months 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 . Blood collection occur visit . Medical history , physical exam , dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan measure bone density , nutrition evaluation occur select visit .</detailed_description>
