	<brief_summary>Graft-vs.-Host Disease ( GVHD ) major complication allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) commonly affect skin , liver , gastrointestinal tract , eye . The common clinical manifestation ocular GVHD generally result involvement lacrimal gland conjunctiva . Lacrimal gland involvement lead aqueous tear deficiency result severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca ( KCS ) significantly increase morbidity patient chronic GVHD . Systemic immunosuppressant cyclosporine ( CsA ) effective treat ocular GVHD include lacrimal gland dysfunction . However , systemic immunosuppression generally prescribed patient whose sole manifestation GVHD ocular complication may negate overall graft-vs.-tumor effect decrease patient survival . Topical CsA corticosteroid generally effective treat aqueous tear deficiency possible due epithelial barrier prevent penetration drug lacrimal gland . A sustained-release subconjunctival CsA implant develop bypass epithelial barrier significantly increase CsA concentration lacrimal gland treat aqueous tear deficiency relate GVHD . The objective randomized pilot study investigate safety potential efficacy CsA implant patient lacrimal gland involvement aqueous tear deficiency relate GVHD . Safety evaluate term adverse event related implant . Efficacy evaluate change Schirmer tear test ( anesthesia ) . Secondary efficacy evaluation include change corneal conjunctival stain grade , best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) , Ocular Surface Disease Index ( OSDI ) , change conjunctival GVHD grade , tear break-up time meibomian gland dysfunction . Patients active systemic GVHD aqueous tear deficiency associate lacrimal gland dysfunction follow allogeneic hematopoietic SCT nine year age old eligible inclusion pilot study . The study involve surgical placement CsA implant subconjunctival space adjacent lacrimal gland one eye participant . Participants older 12 year age randomize receive one two implant release rate . All participant age 12 receive small , low dose implant . However , participant age 12 randomize eligible receive small , low dose implant . The implant remain place two year remove . IF participant clinical success , give option allow implant remain place additional year . Clinical success achieve participant meet follow measure either eye assess 1-year visit : Interval change baseline characteristic Decrease corneal stain great equal 2 Decrease temporal nasal conjunctival stain grade great equal 2 Decrease total stain grade great equal 2 Decrease OSDI calculate score great equal 20 % Increase Schirmer tear test measurement great equal 3 mm Meets mild-moderate KCS characteristic 1 year Corneal stain grade le equal 3 Nasal temporal conjunctival stain grade less equal 3 OSDI calculate score less equal 15 Schirmer tear test measurement great equal 5 mm For participant implant duration one year , safety evaluation conduct baseline ( pre-implantation ) monthly post-implantation 13 month . Additional safety assessment do 1 day , 1 2 week post-operatively implant placement removal procedure . Safety efficacy evaluation conduct baseline , 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month post-implantation , 3 month follow implant removal ( 15 month post-implantation ) . For participant clinical success choose implant remain another year , visit hold described conduct 2-month interval start month 14 . Safety evaluation conduct every 2 month end second year . Additional safety assessment do 1 day , 1 2 week post-operatively implant removal procedure . Safety efficacy evaluation conduct 16 , 20 , 24 month post-implantation , 3 month follow implant removal ( 27 month post-implantation ) .</brief_summary>

However , participant age 12 randomize eligible receive small , low dose implant . On anniversary study visit participant give opportunity retain implant annual basis . This base upon determination clinical success ( define Study Design section ) combine participant 's report symptom improvement . The Implant remove Investigator believe implant harmful participant request implant remove .</detailed_description>
