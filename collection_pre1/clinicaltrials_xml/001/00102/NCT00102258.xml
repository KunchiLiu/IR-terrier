	<brief_summary>This study determine whether add calorie diet help boys growth problem grow well treat Nutropin , growth hormone use help child grow taller . The Food Drug Administration approve Nutropin use child short . This study examine whether give nutritional supplement addition Nutropin help child grow good Nutropin alone . Boys 7 10 year age short average weight , otherwise healthy may eligible study . Candidates must qualify Nutropin treatment boost growth . Boys recruit study Nemours Children 's Clinic Jacksonville , FL , National Institutes Health Bethesda , MD . Participants randomly assign one two treatment group . One group observe 6 month receive Nutropin injection every day 12 month . The second group drink 8 ounce high-calorie beverage call Pediasure every day 6 month receive Nutropin plus Pediasure every day 12 month . In addition treatment , participant undergo follow test procedure schedule indicate : Baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 18 month - Clinical examination - Height measurement - Body composition assessment : Skin-fold thickness caliper use four place body estimate body fat - Bioelectric impedance : A small amount electrical current use calculate percentage body fat . Baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 month - Blood test - Bone age x-ray : x-ray left hand measure growth potential - DEXA ( dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ) scan : x-ray scan measure body fat , muscle , bone mineral content . The subject lie flat table scan . Baseline , 6 , 12 month - Record dietary intake : Parents ask write everything child eats drink 3 day . Using record , dietitian calculates daily caloric intake . - Total energy expenditure : This test determine much energy child us . For test , child drink water label harmless isotope ( heavy oxygen heavy hydrogen ) . For next 10 day collect urine plastic tube home . At end 10 day , parent bring urine clinic analysis determine fast labeled water leave body . This information use calculate much energy child expends day . Participants ' weight measure 2 4 week , monthly remainder 18-month study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Nutrition Hormones Boys With Disordered Growth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose pilot study examine role nutrition interaction growth hormone ( GH ) therapy boys short stature also delay bone age characteristic constitutional delay growth maturation ( CDGM ) . Recent study suggest insufficient caloric intake may contribute pathophysiology CDGM . This prompt u consider whether nutritional intervention may benefit child severe short stature also CDGM . To investigate , would like enroll total 20 boy ( 10-15 boy Jacksonville , Florida 5-10 boy NIH , Bethesda , Maryland ) , age 7-10 year , otherwise healthy , significant short stature ( height SDS le -2.25 = current FDA approve indication use GH idiopathic short stature ) , delay bone age ( great 12 month chronologic age ) , low BMI weight-for-height ( less 25th percentile ) . Ten boys randomize receive observation 6 month , follow GH therapy 12 month . Ten boys randomize receive daily liquid nutritional supplementation 6 month , follow combined GH therapy nutritional supplementation 12 month . For subject , weight gain monitor 2 week , 4 week , monthly . Height gain body composition ( use skin-fold thickness caliper bioelectric impedance analysis ) assess every 3 month . Total energy expenditure , three-day dietary history , bone age , body composition/bone mineral density ( use dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ) , laboratory study ( IGF1 , IGFBP3 , pre-albumin , transferrin , ghrelin , fast insulin , glucose , lipid profile ) obtain baseline every 6 month . We hypothesize nutritional supplementation alone lead small improvement linear growth lean body mass accrual , combine GH therapy , augment anabolic action GH , thereby result even great improvement linear growth velocity lean body mass accrual GH alone . If data study confirm trend , would like proceed large study , appropriately power base result pilot .</detailed_description>

EXCLUSION CRITERIA History major/chronic illness , anosmia/hyposmia , clinically significant abnormality biochemical test . GH deficiency would exclude prior enrollment base anthropometric GH stimulation test data . Endocrinopathies ( except stable thyroid replacement ) , skeletal dysplasia , participation highly competitive endurance sport activity , diagnosis ADHD use stimulant medication previous 3 month also exclusion criterion .</criteria>
