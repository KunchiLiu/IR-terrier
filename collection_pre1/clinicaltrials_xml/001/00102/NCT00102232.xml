	<brief_title>Effect Phosphatidylcholine Plasma Homocysteine Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A high homocysteine concentration potential risk cardiovascular disease . Plasma homocysteine concentration lower betaine supplementation . However , effect choline supplementation , precursor betaine , plasma homocysteine concentration healthy human unknown . If supplementation choline phosphatidylcholine , form choline occur food , lower homocysteine concentration , extra intake compound may lower cardiovascular disease risk human . Comparison : We compare effect supplementation phosphatidylcholine effect placebo fast post-methionine concentration plasma homocysteine healthy men .</detailed_description>
