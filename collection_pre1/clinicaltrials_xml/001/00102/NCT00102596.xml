The lead hypothesis ET pathophysiology unmask spontaneous oscillation originate neuron inferior olive . Both ethanol 1-octanol show reduce spontaneous oscillation animal model ET ; however , 1-octanol dose much low lead intoxication , suggest may useful treatment essential tremor . Our initial study 1-octanol show safe dosage 64mg/kg without sign intoxication , time show benefit . OBJECTIVE We plan evaluate efficacy different 1-octanol formulation human base accelerometry spirography . We also evaluate drug metabolite bioavailabilities use high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) detection method plasma urine sample . STUDY POPULATION We study adult subject ethanol-responsive Essential Tremor ( ET ) .

Phase I study design develop octanol detection assay use HPLC . Four subject receive daily escalate dosage ( 1-32 mg/kg ) single 1-octanol formulation follow crossover trial formulation dosage 64 mg/kg . Phase II study 20 subject receive one two formulation 64 mg/kg inpatient day 1 follow 24 hour period close monitoring . The second formulation give day 3 patient undergo close monitoring 24 hour . OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure study efficacy base tremor rating accelerometry spirography .

Addendum : Based result assays subject participate Part 1 2 protocol , would like conduct exploratory study ( Part 3 ) consist two subject receive dose 128mg/kg 1-octanol . This meant primarily explore plasma concentration 1-octanol , also provide valuable information regard safety efficacy high dose . The remainder experimental design maintain , exception additional safety precaution discuss protocol consent .</detailed_description>
