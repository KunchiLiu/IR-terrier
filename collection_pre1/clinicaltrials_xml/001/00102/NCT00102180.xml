	<brief_title>Drug-Induced Sudden Death &amp; Ventricular Arrhythmia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Drug-induced sudden cardiac death ( also call sudden death , SD ) ventricular arrhythmia ( VA ) arisen major public health concern last decade . Sudden death/ventricular arrhythmia result withdrawal drug recent year adverse drug reaction , identification 100 non-cardiac drug suspect high-risk . Unfortunately , control study measure risk associate specific drug number , presumably complexity study massive sample size need study outcome . Even study `` large '' database lack adequate statistical power crucial subgroup analyse . This lack control data clinical sudden death/ventricular arrhythmia necessitate reliance uncontrolled observation study putative marker risk QTc prolongation electrocardiogram . However , utility uncontrolled observation always subject question , validity putative marker remain unknown . As result , clinician , patient , regulator , drug manufacturer ill-equipped address critical clinical public health decision concern drug-induced sudden death/ventricular arrhythmia . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study compile massive new pharmacoepidemiologic database Medicaid data ( link Medicare data enrol program , Social Security Administration Death Masterfile ) five large Medicaid program . This combined UK General Practice Research Database . This combined database use conduct series nest case-control case-crossover study measure absolute relative rate all-cause death sudden death/ventricular arrhythmia ( SD/VA ) associate five commonly use drug class great concern : antipsychotic , antidepressant , opioid analgesic , quinolone antibiotic , macrolide antibiotic . A multi-stage investigative strategy use : Stage 1 compile database , assure quality , reproduce know association . Stage 2a compare drug among class interest . Stage 2b use case-crossover design look association control stable patient factor . Stage 2c examine effect dose inhibitor pharmacokinetic clearance , functional equivalent high-dose use . Stage 3 develop predictive index stratify patient subgroup receive high-risk drug .</detailed_description>
