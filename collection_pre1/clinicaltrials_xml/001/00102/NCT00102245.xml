	<brief_summary>This study examine blood factor may cause prevent disease involve iron red blood cell . Iron important nutrient human health need produce red blood cell . Red blood cell carry oxygen body tissue . A good understanding iron red blood cell may help lead good treatment several disease include anemia . Patients age red cell abnormality follow category may eligible study : - Diseases deficiency , overload maldistribution iron - Known red blood cell disease , anemia hemoglobinopathy - Red blood cell diseases unknown cause , hemolysis unknown cause - Red blood cell abnormality overt clinical disease , hereditary persistence fetal hemoglobin Participants undergo follow procedure : - Medical history - Physical examination - Standard medical test relate individual 's iron red blood cell condition Blood draw follow purpose : - Testing syphilis hepatitis B C , HIV , HTLV-1viruses , pregnancy test woman become pregnant - Research purpose . This blood analyze gene , protein , sugar , fat molecule .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Laboratory Investigation Humans With Informative Iron Erythroid Phenotypes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies iron erythroid cell , provide fundamental insight structure function relationship protein , energy metabolism , molecular basis many disease . Based upon importance iron hemoglobin production , regulation erythropoiesis iron metabolism closely link , iron deficiency anemia remain one common diseases worldwide . The discovery sickle hemoglobin abnormal electrophoretic mobility mark begin molecular medicine era . The advent recombinant DNA technology sequence methodology result characterization erythroid cell well beyond protein base study include gene structure expression . Globin gene research , particular , provide wealth information expression , regulation insulation mammalian gene . More recently , study iron absorption trafficking provide new avenue research aim toward growth energy homeostasis . Genome base approach also utilized discovery direct relationship erythroid cell biology iron homeostasis . Hence , strong evidence fundamental clinical advance field iron erythroid biology base upon careful study human informative phenotype . Clinically base correlation genotype phenotype proven , systematic approach understand molecular basis disease . With completion sequence human genome , complete , genetically base description disease achievable . Efforts aim toward haplotype mapping enhance genotype phenotype correlation directly clinical sample . Considerable progress already make regard use normal human erythroid cell . In contrast classic study involve single gene protein , computational biology high throughput technology permit analysis complex erythroid phenotype include related iron pathology . This information invaluable understanding molecular mechanism alter disease state . The immediate aim protocol perform phenotypic analysis human informative iron erythroid phenotype . These study expect result detailed clinical phenotyping collection bank clinical specimen study . In addition , predict ongoing growth new technology may eventually use molecular genetic phenotyping clinical sample ( example include oligonucleotide chip high throughput mass spectroscopy ) . Based upon prediction , plan use sample collect ass possible clinical us technology become available . The eventual aim discovery identifier may predictive disease pathogenesis , severity clinical response intervention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A clinically definable iron erythroid cell phenotype define : Group 1 : Patients know iron erythroid disease ( example : iron deficient anemia ineffective erythropoiesis ) . OR Group 2 : Patients diseases unknown etiology ( example : unexplained iron overload anemia ) . OR Group 3 : Patients informative phenotype absence overt clinical disease ( example : hereditary persistence fetal hemoglobin ) . OR Group 4 : Healthy volunteer whose blood bone marrow sample utilized understand normal iron erythroid biology comparison group describe . AGE AND GENDER CONSIDERATIONS : Age range : Infancy unlimited Adults : Adults fall Groups 14 eligible enroll protocol . They must possess ability comprehend investigational nature study provide inform consent . Minors : Minors fall group 14 eligible enroll study collection research blood . Within Group 4 ( healthy volunteer , minor ) , research involve great minimal risk . GENERAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy volunteer Subjects iron erythroid diseases unable comprehend investigational nature laboratory research ineligible enroll protocol . INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR BONE MARROW SAMPLING : With exception minor , pregnant female , breastfeed mother , volunteer meet General Inclusion Criteria blood collection may offer option bone marrow sample part protocol . Minors , pregnant female , breastfeed mother exclude bone marrow sample specifically perform protocol . However , ask consent collection additional sample bone marrow 1 ) undergo bone marrow sample procedure clinical purpose , 2 ) collection additional bone marrow undergo clinical procedure research sample collection alter clinical procedure . Other bone marrow sample exclusion criterion include : 1 ) allergy xylocaine ( lidocaine ) skin cleanse medication chlorhexidine/Hibiclens . 2 ) clotting disorder , low platelet ( &lt; 50,000k ) take medication interfere blood clotting , aspirin , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent ( Motrin Advil ) blood thin agent ( coumadin/warfarin ) .</criteria>
