	<brief_title>Sarasar Temodar Glioblastoma Multiforme Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temozolomide chemotherapy drug work attack cancer cell , cause die . Lonafarnib new drug may slow growth cancer cell . Used combination , two drug may control growth brain tumor . Before treatment start , complete physical exam , include height weight measurement take , well neurological ( brain ) exam . Blood test ( less 2 tablespoon blood ) perform . A MRI scan brain do . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . If eligible take part study , give temozolomide lonafarnib treatment . The size study drug dos give increase every 3 participant enrol study , high safe dose drug , give combination , find . If enrolled Phase Ib part study , treat high tolerable dose find Phase I part study . You receive dose temozolomide 7-day , 7-day schedule . You also receive Sarasar mouth twice day use 7-day , 7-day schedule . Temozolomide lonafarnib take mouth study . You take temozolomide day 7 day every week ( Days 1-7 15-21 ) . You must eat 1 hour take drug ; drinking water allow . During alternate week ( Days 8-14 22-28 ) , take lonafarnib tablet mouth morning evening , water . You eat grapefruit drink grapefruit juice take study medication affect study medication broken body . This repeat every 28 day ( 1 study course ) . All treatment may give outpatient basis , require hospital stay . You may keep take temozolomide lonafarnib 24 course ( 2 year ) . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . You may receive treatment cancer ( include surgery ) take part study . You come clinic complete physical exam course treatment . You neurological exam within 14 day every odd-numbered course ( 3 , 5 , 7 , etc ) , time doctor feel need . Blood count ( 1 teaspoon ) do every course treatment Day 22 course . Blood chemistry test anticonvulsant level , applicable , ( less 1 tablespoon ) repeat course treatment . An MRI scan do odd-numbered ( 3 , 5 , 7 , etc . ) course treatment , time doctor feel need . Patients take blood thinner warfarin blood test ( less 1 teaspoon ) often check effect drug . Your doctor may decide take combination treatment 2 year give lonafarnib alone . If continue receive lonafarnib without addition temozolomide , receive minimum 1 year combination therapy , routine blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) test every 4 week MRI clinic follow-up physical neurological exam every 3 month receive continuation treatment . When finish study treatment , another complete physical neurological exam . Blood test ( less 2 tablespoon blood ) perform . Another MRI scan do . This investigational study . Temozolomide approve FDA treatment brain tumor . Lonafarnib approve research use treatment brain tumor . The use two drug together experimental . About 35 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
