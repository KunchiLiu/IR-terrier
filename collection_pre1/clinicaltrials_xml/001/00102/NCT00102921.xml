	<detailed_description>CCX282-B develop treatment inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn ’ Disease . CCX282-B highly potent , orally active , chemokine receptor antagonist whose single target G-protein couple receptor CCR9 . The CCR9 receptor express T-cells thymus well intestine , small population T-cells peripheral blood . In human , CCR9 receptor implicate Crohn ’ Disease ulcerative colitis . Crohn ’ Disease autoimmune disease involve entire length gastrointestinal tract , manifestation terminal small intestine colon . This condition characterize mucosal ulceration penetrate deeply bowel wall . Sometimes ulcerative lesion completely penetrate bowel wall , lead fistula formation infectious complication require surgical intervention . Patients experience considerable lifestyle disruption disability disease , include diarrhea , abdominal pain , malnutrition , anemia , repetitive surgery remove disease-affected gastrointestinal segment . ChemoCentryx Protocol CL003_282 double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , two stratum , Phase 2A pilot study safety , tolerability , immunologic clinical activity , population pharmacokinetics single dose level CCX282-B administer daily four consecutive week patient active , moderate severe Crohn ’ Disease . The primary immunologic clinical activity objective study provide pilot information regard immunologic clinical activity daily oral dos CCX282-B treatment moderate severe Crohn ’ Disease , base change Crohn ’ Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) . Secondary immunologic clinical activity objective include evaluation effect CCX282-B Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( IBDQ ) instrument , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , endoscopic appearance biopsy colon terminal ileum , marker leukocyte subset activation status . The primary safety objective study evaluate safety tolerability oral dos CCX282-B patient moderate severe Crohn ’ Disease . In addition , blood sample collect evaluation population pharmacokinetics CCX282-B .</detailed_description>
