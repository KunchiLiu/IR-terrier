	<brief_summary>This study evaluate accuracy effectiveness experimental track device locate abnormality invasive procedure , biopsy ablation , easily visualize usual imaging technique , compute tomography ( CT ) scan ultrasound . Some lesion , certain liver kidney tumor , small endocrine abnormality , others , may hard find visible second . The new method use needle miniature track device bury inside metal tell tip needle locate , somewhat like mini GPS , global positioning system . It use weak magnet localize device like miniature satellite system . This study explore whether system use future accurately place needle near desire location abnormality . Patients 18 year age old lesion need biopsied ablation procedure require CT guidance may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history review medical record , include image study . Participants undergo biopsy ablation procedure normally would , follow exception : sticker place skin procedure weak magnet place nearby . The needle use similar one would normally use except contain metal coil spring bury deep within needle metal . The procedure involve follow step : 1 . Small 1-cm plastic donut place skin tape . 2 . A planning CT scan do . 3 . The CT scan send computer match patient 's body location help weak magnet . 4 . The needle use procedure place towards target tissue abnormality `` smart needle '' location light old CT scan . 5 . A repeat CT do normally look location needle . 6 . After procedure CT scan examine determine well new tool locate needle old scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The effectiveness target lesion specific area surgery , angiography , CT-guided , ultrasound-guided biopsy , ablation , currently may limit visibility target procedure . Accurate therapeutic intervention may depend upon accurate device placement , may difficult certain setting , liver tumor visible brief moment time transient arterial phase contrast injection , soon disappear dynamic imaging . Surgery , angiography , image guide therapy diagnostic procedure could vastly improve enabling use pre-procedural imaging procedure [ location difficult visualize transiently visible target ] . Tracking device allow use pre-operative imaging procedure . Having information available could vastly improve target accuracy surgery , angiography , CT-guided , ultrasound-guided biopsy ablation . A method improve target could potentially benefit patient future reduce total radiation exposure CT scan fluoroscopic monitoring biopsy , decrease certain surgical risk , although specific subject study . Various method device track use past throughout 20th century neurosurgery use stereotactic frame similar purpose , register pre-operative imaging patient invasive procedure guide treatment . Objectives : To define clinical utility electromagnetic tracking surgery interventional procedure specific patient population . Eligibility : 1 . All patient must pre-operative CT , MR , PET scan perform NIH . 2 . Age great 18 year . 3 . Patients must actively enrol NIH protocol schedule surgery , angiography , CT- ultrasound-guided biopsy . Design : This pilot study examine use guidance system navigate monitor device like biopsy ablation needle , ultrasound transducer , needle guide , guidewires , scalpel , cauterization device ( herein refer device ( ) ) localization relation pre-operative images.There 9 cohort include protocol . 1 . Prostate biopsy 2 . Percutaneous biopsy diagnostic correlation 3. percutaneous ablation needle placement compilation 4 . Open/Laparoscopic surgery 5 . Angiography 6 ) Auto registration biopsy 7 ) ablation 8 ) PET registration 9 ) prostate biopsy determine predictive value relative strength MRI sequence predict cancer specific prostate core location . The total accrual ceiling protocol 3235 subject . The non-prostate cohort ( # 2 - # 8 ) exploratory study , whereas prostate cohort ( cohorts 1 9 ) natural history study define specific patient population fusion biopsy may clinical value , characterize clinical value specific patient population , patient specific region prostate target , specific prostate volume , prior negative prostate biopsy , PSA value within specific range .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must fulfill follow criterion eligible study admission : 1 . All patient must CT , MR , PET scan available digital format . 2 . Age great equal 18 year . 3 . No serious concurrent medical illness would preclude patient make rational informed decision participation . 4 . The ability understand willingness sign write informed consent form , comply protocol . If question , ethic consult obtain . 5 . All patient nonprostate biopsy cohort , must undergo surgical interventional radiology procedure angiography CT/ USguided biopsy preoperative imaging . PROSTATE BIOPSY COHORT ( Cohorts 1 9 ) INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Source patient community large well patient undergone prostate MRI abnormality identify follow : 1 . PSA &gt; 2.5 Abnormal digital rectal exam abnormality identify prostate MRI witha clinical indication biopsy . 2 . Prebiopsy prostate MRI show targetable lesion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients follow exclude study entry : 1 . Patients alter mental status precludes understand consent biopsy procedure exclude study . 2 . Patients unlikely able hold reasonably still procedure table length procedure . 3 . Patients know allergy adhesive latex skin reaction dressing ( since adhesive fiducials could theoretically induce rash patient ) , adhesive fiducials use . 4 . Inability hold breath , procedure perform conscious sedation , without general anesthesia . 5 . Patients pacemaker automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator . 6 . Gross body weight CT table limit ( 375 pound ) , CT table use .</criteria>
