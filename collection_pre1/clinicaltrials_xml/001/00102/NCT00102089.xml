	<brief_summary>This study test safety side effect experimental vaccine booster HIV . A vaccine substance give try create immunity resistance disease infection . The vaccine use study call VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP . It make adenovirus ( common virus cause upper respiratory infection ) contain DNA ( genetic material ) three HIV protein . Injected human , viral DNA instruct body make small amount HIV protein . VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP give people previously receive vaccine call VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP NIH protocol 03-I-0022 . Important : Study participant catch adenovirus infection HIV AIDS vaccine protein make . Healthy normal volunteer participate NIH protocol 03-I-0022 may eligible study . They must complete three injection 4 mg 8 mg VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP without experience serious side effect possibly related vaccine . Candidates screen medical history , clinical evaluation , blood urine test , HIV pregnancy counsel . Participants receive one injection VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP day enroll study ( study day 0 ) . They observe least 30 minute immunization . At home , record temperature symptom may experience , include effect injection site , 5 day call study nurse 1 2 day injection . They immediately report symptom clinic staff , necessary , come clinic examination . Participants five additional clinic visit study , week 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 24 , last 2 hour . At visit , check health change problem ask medication take . Blood drawn immune function testing , HLA typing ( genetic test immune system marker ) , genetic factor . A urine sample collect visit . Additional laboratory test may request visit . Some participant may undergo apheresis week 4 visit collect large number white blood cell laboratory test see immune system respond study vaccine . For procedure , blood collect needle arm vein flow catheter ( plastic tube ) machine separate component centrifugation ( spin ) . The white cell extract rest blood return another needle arm . The procedure take 1 3 hour . Participants test three time HIV question sexual behavior drug use . They complete `` social impact '' questionnaire week 24 include question problem may experience participation study regard thing insurance , health care , friend , family , employment , housing , education , government agency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIV-1 Vaccine Booster Previously Immunized Uninfected Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I open-label study examine safety , tolerability immune response multiclade HIV adenoviral vector vaccine booster vaccination uninfected adult . The hypothesis vaccine safe booster vaccine elicit immune response HIV . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP booster vaccination uninfected subject previously receive 3 injection VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP one year prior study vaccination . The secondary objective include immunogenicity evaluation adenovirus serotype 5 ( Ad5 ) antibody titer , social impact . Exploratory evaluation include epitope mapping immunogenicity evaluation . Product Description : VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP recombinant product compose 4 adenoviral vector ( Ad ) ( 3:1:1:1 ratio ) encode HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein clade B HIV-1 Env glycoproteins clades A , B , C , respectively . Subjects : Healthy adult volunteer previously receive three injection VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP dosage 4 mg 8 mg VRC 004 study ( 03-I-0022 ) : subject group 20 39 year old time enrollment VRC 004 ; participate VRC 009 approximately 1-3 year old time enrollment VRC 009 . Study Plan : Up thirty-two volunteer receive one 1 mL injection study agent dosage 1 x 10 ( 10 ) PU IM deltoid muscle . Safety immunogenicity evaluate follow-up visit subsequent 24 week . The peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) sample immunogenicity study collect Week 4 vaccination obtain apheresis subject willing eligible apheresis apheresis appointment conveniently schedule interval specify ; otherwise PBMCs obtain 80 mL blood collect phlebotomy . Study Duration : Subjects evaluate 6 clinical visit 24 week study injection . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint safety vaccine administer dose 1 x 10 ( 10 ) particle unit ( PU ) intramuscular injection . Secondary endpoint immunogenicity indicate HIV-specific antibody cellular immune response Week 6 , Ad5 antibody titer Week 0 Week 4 social impact Week 24 . Exploratory analyse immunogenicity Weeks 12 24 , Ad5 antibody titer Week 24 epitope mapping CD8+ CD4+ T cell response Week 4 .</detailed_description>
