	<brief_summary>The overall objective 3-year project determine whether provision realignment therapy patient medial knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) relieve knee pain improve function . The researcher test hypothesis compare control treatment , use realignment therapy ( valgus knee brace + motion control shoe + orthosis ) effective medial knee OA . The specific aim : - To undertake 30 week randomize crossover clinical trial patient medial knee osteoarthritis determine whether provision realignment therapy lead low pain score improve function time treatment use placebo treatment ; - To perform open label follow-up study track use effectiveness treatment .

	<criteria>Trial participant must meet American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criteria osteoarthritis knee pain , ache stiffness past 30 day evidence radiograph definite osteophyte . In addition , researcher interest recruit person medial knee osteoarthritis , participant need evidence disease compartment radiograph , lateral compartment patellofemoral compartment disease . Medial disease base definition use researcher 's previous publication definite radiographic OA + least grade 1 medial narrowing ( 03 scale ) use atlas Osteoarthritis Research Society International . Individuals clinical evidence patellofemoral disease knee pathology ( medial compartment OA ) likely cause knee pain . Individuals usually use ambulation aid walk cane , crutch , walker wheel chair . Amputation foot previous major trauma foot would raise concern whether insert might worsen foot pain . Persons foot lesion sores ulcer redistribute load foot might dangerous , exclude . Known neuropathy diabetes reason . Past history deep venous thrombosis . Pain emanate back hip knee determine screen questionnaire Low pain score WOMAC , widely use well validated questionnaire ass knee symptom . To evaluate response , researcher require patient minimal score least 4 10 least 2 5 question , total great 15 50 WOMAC pain scale eligible knee prerandomization phone call visit , randomization visit . This allow u detect response treatment response occur . Planning move area within 9 month study screen Symptomatic comorbid disease limit walk knee pain ( per screen questionnaire ) Receiving corticosteroid injection month prior start trial . No treatment trigger exclusion , although patient glucosamine +/or chondroitin +/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) researcher require must take treatment least 2 month prior onset trial commit start new treatment throughout trial . Bilateral total knee replacement ( TKR ) plan TKR next 6 month affect knee . Known cause arthritis include rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , gout , psoriatic arthritis , pseudogout . Failure pas 4 week runin test . Volunteers precontemplative state ( person would consider realignment therapy therapeutic option knee OA ) .</criteria>
