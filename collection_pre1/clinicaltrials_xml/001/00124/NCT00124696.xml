	<brief_title>Cocaethylene Treatment Cocaine Dependence - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , medication available specifically treat cocaine addiction . Cocaethylene active metabolite cocaine similar chemical structure cocaine . The purpose study determine whether substitution therapy cocaethylene safe effective treatment cocaine dependence . This double-blind , placebo-controlled trial occur 3 part . In Part 1 , individual pharmacokinetics intravenous dose cocaethylene determine order estimate individualize cocaethylene infusion rate pharmacokinetic parameter . This provide important information cocaethylene process body . In Part 2 , infusion cocaethylene , produce venous plasma concentration 200 ng/ml , administer 8-hour period . Clinical monitoring blood sample occur order determine safety profile cocaethylene . During Part 3 , ability cocaethylene modify acute effect intravenous cocaine determine . Cocaethylene administer plasma concentration 0 ng/ml , 50 ng/ml , 200 ng/ml 8-hour period . Participants randomly assign receive challenge intravenous dose cocaine ( 0.5 mg/kg 1 mg/kg ) placebo 4-hour mark cocaethylene infusion . Following initial 8-hour period , cocaethylene infusion continue additional 5 hour . Behavioral physiological measure collect throughout study session predetermine time evaluate whether tolerance cocaethylene develop . These measure also help determine whether cocaethylene modifies produce tolerance effect acute dose cocaine .</detailed_description>
