	<brief_summary>The Cross Cancer Institute recently acquire tomotherapy radiotherapy treatment machine ; first kind Canada . It potential improve cancer treatment outcomes radiotherapy use . Cervix cancer disease radiotherapy particularly important treatment modality . The researcher believe combine tomotherapy ( ability give high dos radiation area cancer spar normal tissue ) radiotherapy give inside uterus vagina ( brachytherapy ) disease outcomes improve . For possible researcher need accurately map dos radiation give cervix , uterus pelvic organ two type radiation treatment . As well use treatment , tomotherapy machine also use take medical image use much low dos radiation . This study allow researcher develop map process use low dos radiation tomotherapy unit take medical x-ray image patient treat brachytherapy cervix cancer . In special circumstance researcher expect image high quality conventional compute tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Megavoltage CT Imaging Intracavitary Radiation Treatment Cervix Cancer Proposal To assess feasibility perform CT image use megavoltage CT scanner five patient remote afterloading intracavitary applicator insert purpose deliver intracavitary radiotherapy treatment cervix cancer . Rationale While recent improvement treatment advance stage cervix cancer combine radical radiation treatment concurrent cisplatin base chemotherapy , room improvement local regional control . One approach achieve increase dose therapeutic radiation clinical target volume without exceed tolerance adjacent normal tissue . Modern radiotherapy technique allow good conformation high dose radiation volume clinical target volume use external beam technique ( conformal radiation treatment intensity modulate radiation treatment ) use tomotherapy likely particularly advantageous regard . The mainstay cervix cancer radiotherapy always likely remain use brachytherapy . Future improvement outcome cervix cancer treat radiotherapy therefore likely necessitate accurately combine intracavitary radiation treatment intensity modulate external beam radiation treatment particularly use tomotherapy technique . The ability accurately reconstruct three-dimensional dosimetry achieve combined use intracavitary radiation treatment helical tomotherapy pivotal success strategy . Conventional CT imaging patient receive intracavitary radiation treatment hamper distortion artifact metallic applicator . The opportunity gain improve image use megavoltage CT scan use equipment patient set-up ultimately used delivery tomotherapy offer unique potential advantage solution problem . By image patient remote afterloading application situ , researcher able generate accurate isodose distribution three dimension intracavitary component cervix cancer treatment . By contour clinical target volume , include primary cancer , local route spread regional pelvic lymph node , researcher explore feasibility generating combine helical tomotherapy intracavitary radiation treatment plan . Patients Methods Patients receive intracavitary brachytherapy low dose rate selectron Cross Cancer Institute approach participate pilot study . An informed consent obtain five patient study . Following insertion remote afterloading applicator operate room , patient normally transfer operating room Simulator C orthogonal simulator film Station 30 treatment start approximately two hour later dosimetry calculation perform treatment prescribed . For patient consent study , proceed Simulator C Station 30 via tomotherapy unit CBIAR megavoltage CT scan take . Patients accompany brachytherapy radiation therapist . The megavoltage CT scan take approximately one hour perform , result treatment delay patient . Isodose volume prescribe intracavitary brachytherapy reconstruct megavoltage image . The feasibility define clinical target volume megavoltage scan explore . This may require fusion conventional CT image already take diagnostic external beam treatment planning purpose . Megavoltage and/or fuse image use pilot integration tomotherapy intensity modulate radiation therapy treatment plan intracavitary brachytherapy dosimetry . The current study influence individual patient treatment prelude potential dose escalation study use tomotherapy patient cervix cancer .</detailed_description>
