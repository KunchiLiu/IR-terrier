	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Adenoviral HIV Vaccine ( VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP ) With Without Plasmid HIV Vaccine ( VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP ) HIV Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may control development safe effective vaccine prevent HIV infection . This study evaluate safety immunogenicity experimental adenovirus-vectored multiclade HIV vaccine , VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP , follow either similarly structure DNA plasmid HIV vaccine , VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP , placebo . The DNA plasmid vaccine code protein HIV subtypes A , B , C , together represent 90 % new HIV infection world . HIV uninfected volunteer recruit Kenya Rwanda . Volunteers participate study 1 year . Participants randomly assign one four group : - Group A participant receive low dose adenovirus-vectored vaccine placebo study entry . - Group B participant receive high dose adenovirus-vectored vaccine placebo study entry . - Group C participant receive DNA plasmid vaccine placebo study entry Months 1 2 . They receive either low dose adenovirus-vectored vaccine placebo Month 6 . - Group D participant receive DNA plasmid vaccine placebo study entry Months 1 2 . They receive either high dose adenovirus-vectored vaccine placebo Month 6 . All participant undergo vital sign measurement receive vaccination . Participants Groups A B 9 study visit 12 month . A physical exam , adverse event reporting , medical medication history occur visit . HIV test counsel blood urine collection occur select visit . Participants Groups C D 17 study visit 12 month .
