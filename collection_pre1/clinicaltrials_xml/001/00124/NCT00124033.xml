	<brief_summary>This study design assess whether new technique call facilitate endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) superior conventional ERCP removing stone find bile duct time laparoscopic cholecystectomy . ERCP endoscopic procedure use facilitate radiological examination subsequent manipulation common bile duct ( eg . opening , call sphincterotomy ) . Both facilitated conventional ERCP perform separate procedure initial gallbladder surgery . This comparative study two technique randomise clinical trial . The aim randomise clinical trial enable surgeon decide whether placement plastic stent time laparoscopic cholecystectomy improve success rate safety subsequent ERCP sphincterotomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Management Common Bile Duct ( CBD ) Stones Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Symptomatic gallstone disease common . In year July 2001-2002 , laparoscopic cholecystectomy perform 5,235 patient NSW public hospital . Up 18 % patient undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy gallstone may concomitant common bile duct stone ( choledocholithiasis ) . Twenty-five percent bile duct stone completely unsuspected . Therefore optimal management bile duct stone significant issue general surgeon perform common operation . Yet , management patient laparoscopic era remain contentious . Prior laparoscopic era cholecystectomy patient bile duct stone manage surgically open cholecystectomy ( OC ) , direct exploration common bile duct ( choledochotomy ) . However , open surgical bile duct exploration wan popularity progressively stone dealt endoscopically , either pre post cholecystectomy . As laparoscopic technology advance , simultaneous clearance bile duct time laparoscopic cholecystectomy regain popularity . Some surgeon elect remove bile duct stone index operation cystic duct . This approach success rate 75 90 % . When failure clear bile duct transcystically , surgeon proceed choledochotomy clear duct , others close cystic duct stump , leave stone situ remove later date endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) sphincterotomy . The argument favour immediate choledochotomy duct may clear one sit . The argument morbidity choledochotomy considerable . The argument subsequent ERCP morbidity choledochotomy avoid . The argument subsequent ERCP may difficulty cannulate common bile duct ERCP sphincterotomy associate significant morbidity , particularly pancreatitis . An alternative approach take majority surgeon NSW confront common bile duct stone laparoscopic cholecystectomy close cystic duct stump patient , without explore duct transcystically . Stones leave situ , remove later date endoscopically - ERCP sphincterotomy . The attendant risk approach mention . Another approach facilitate performance post-operative ERCP sphincterotomy insert stent transcystically time laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Facilitated ERCP recently report prospective consecutive series Nepean Hospital . Failure access common bile duct first attempt 1.2 % series , compare favourably duct access failure rate - report literature - 5-12 % without facilitation stent . The incidence pancreatitis , bleed duodenal perforation facilitate ERCP 0 % , 0 % 0.6 % , respectively . Two case ( 1.2 % ) cholangitis also report . Comparison series suggest facilitate ERCP offer real advantage conventional unfacilitated ERCP bile duct stone removal , report pancreatitis rate 2â€“11 % ( rate 8 % ) ; bleed rate 2-4 % duodenal perforation rate 1-4 % . The mortality rate ERCP technique compare preliminary stage insufficient number Nepean series .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must able give informed consent preoperatively ( i.e . elective procedure ) Patients high normal risk CBD stone identify OC . For example : *CBD stone identify ultrasound ; *Wide CBD ( &gt; 6mm ) ultrasound ; *Previous , recent , current cholangitis , jaundice , biliary pancreatitis ; *Abnormal AST ALT level ( &gt; 2 time normal ) . Pregnancy time surgery Patients fit surgery . For example : *Those acute cholecystitis persistent obstructive jaundice ; *Patients previous ERCP sphincterotomy ; *Patients intervention technically possible ( eg . previous Billroth II gastrectomy ) .</criteria>
