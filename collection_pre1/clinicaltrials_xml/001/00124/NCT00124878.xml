	<detailed_description>STUDY DESCRIPTION : The study carry Rakai Health Sciences Program , research collaboration Uganda Virus Research Institute/Uganda Ministry Health , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health researcher Makerere University , Kampala , Uganda . - The study , conduct Rakai District , Uganda , enrol 997 HIV+ follow detailed informed consent process , randomize receive either immediate ( within several day week ) delay ( two year ) circumcision . The goal assess safety acceptability male circumcision among HIV+ men , assess potential effect male circumcision acquisition STDs HSV-2 . Hypotheses male circumcision acceptable safe HIV+ men , reduce rate acquisition STDs , reduce frequency STD symptom , genital ulceration . - The study also enrol 500 men , regardless HIV status , decline receive HIV result , despite encouragement . Hypotheses circumcision acceptable safe men decline HIV result , reduce rate acquisition HIV STDs , frequency STD symptom genital ulcer . - The study enrol 3,700 female partner men group 1 2 , well 5,000 HIV-negative men enrol complementary NIH-funded study male circumcision HIV prevention ( U1 AI51171 separately register ) . Following informed consent , woman partner follow annually assess acceptability safety male circumcision female partner , potential effect male circumcision HIV STD acquisition . The hypothesis male circumcision acceptable safe woman partner , reduce acquisition HIV STDs HSV-2 HPV ( human papilloma virus cause cervical cancer . ) - Finally , study also follow ~3,000 men woman ~50 community circumcision trial take place , order ass community attitude towards knowledge male circumcision , ass whether preventive behavior ( abstinence , monogamy , number partner , condom use , etc ... ) change community circumcision become available . The hypothesis male circumcision acceptable community result behavioral disinhibition ( increase rate high risk behavior ) . The Gates-funded study register complementary separate NIH-funded trial male circumcision HIV-negative men accept HIV result , carry Rakai Health Sciences Program study team . The latter study , enrol 5000 HIV-negative men , design answer whether male circumcision acceptable safe HIV-neg men , whether procedure reduces acquisition HIV STDs . The complementary Gates-funded trial design answer follow additional question : - Is male circumcision acceptable safe HIV-infected men , reduce rate acquisition STDs men ? These question great importance future circumcision program : - Will program need screen HIV+ men ( circumcision show unsafe men , potentially result delayed healing ) future program include HIV+ men , procedure safe , potential benefit reduce STD acquisition , improve genital hygiene reduce rate STD symptomatology ? - Is male circumcision acceptable safe men decline HIV result , reduce rate acquisition HIV STDS men ? From prior Rakai Program data , researcher know men decline HIV result tend high risk behavior . Determining potential circumcision risk men ( , potentially delay healing high risk behavior ) benefit ( potentially , reduce rate HIV STD acquisition ) thus important design future large scale circumcision program . From public health viewpoint , important know whether program include exclude men decline HIV result . ( Please note : Rakai Program strongly recommend encourages receipt HIV result , provide result confidentially free charge . The great majority Rakai Program research participant ( 85-90 % ) accept HIV result , minority continue decline , although latter group get small every year . In addition , please also note even participant decline HIV result , Rakai Program still provide detailed HIV prevention education counsel . ) Enrollment men decline HIV result also congruent Ugandan Ministry Health Policy , encourage force individual study participant receive HIV result . Enrollment female partner design answer important question regard potential effect male circumcision woman . Should male circumcision reduce HIV STD acquisition woman , would represent additional important public health benefit procedure would add cost effectiveness male circumcision program . However , procedure associate increase HIV transmission ( example , due increase transmission circumcision surgical would fully heal ) , crucial potential risk identify rapidly within trial , order prevent risk within trial potential future circumcision program . Following enrollment , men circumcision arm follow post-operatively weekly interval wound heal fully certify , , 4-6 week , 6 month , 12 month 24 month . Men control arm follow 4-6 week 6 , 12 24 month . At baseline follow , men respond detailed sociodemographic , behavioral health questionnaire , provide biological sample ( venous blood , urine , sub-preputial swab [ prior circumcision ] circumcise men , foreskin collect time surgery . ) Samples allow assessment multiple infection , include HIV , HSV-2 , gonorrhea , chlamydia syphilis .
