	<brief_title>Study Determine Prevalence Osteoporosis Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer Treated With Hormonal Manipulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION - Osteoporosis common disorder many predispose factor include hypogonadism variety cause . Prostate cancer second common malignancy men . The standard treatment men advance prostate cancer hormonal manipulation order decrease testosterone level render man hypogonadal . There increase body literature suggest men prostate cancer treat hormonal manipulation develop osteoporosis associate complication commonly age match control . With increase incidence prostate cancer increase indication hormonal therapy use advanced prostate cancer , osteoporosis men major health concern.Hormonal manipulation order obtain castrate level testosterone achieve bilateral orchiectomy , Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone agonist ( LHRHA ) steroidal antiandrogens combine mini dos estrogen base therapy . Nonsteroidal antiandrogens also use management advanced prostate cancer however , , enough suppress testosterone . The data exactly common severe problem osteoporosis men treat different form hormonal manipulation sparse lack data , currently accept standard care investigation management osteoporosis men . The researcher propose start pilot study first determine prevalence osteoporosis 6 different population men advance prostate cancer , ( 1 ) newly diagnose , ( 2 ) treat orchiectomy , ( 3 ) treat LHRHA , ( 4 ) treat steroidal antiandrogen therapy , ( 5 ) treat nonsteroidal antiandrogen base therapy , ( 6 ) treat complete androgen blockade ( LHRHA plus nonsteroidal antiandrogen ) . OBJECTIVES - To determine , population , bone mineral density measure Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) lumbar spine , proximal hip ( total hip , femoral neck trochanter ) , non-dominant distal radius , document biochemical marker bone turnover , document vertebral fracture body height , document aspect body composition include adipose tissue muscle mass measure whole body composition densitometry , document potential confounding factor predispose prostate cancer patient osteoporosis . STUDY DESIGN - This primarily descriptive , exploratory study describe prevalence osteoporosis 6 group define . The diagnosis osteoporosis base bone densitometry study . There accepted densitometric criterion assessment normal abnormal bone mass . The criterion largely develop postmenopausal Caucasian woman reference value also available Caucasian , Black Hispanic men . Normal bone density describe T-score less -1 . T-scores -1 -2.5 indicative osteopenia , T-scores le -2.5 indicative osteoporosis . The prevalence osteoporosis ( T value le 2.5 ) group report . Information biochemical marker bone turnover , vertebral fracture , risk factor also describe . PATIENT SELECTION - Patients biopsy proven advanced prostate cancer , know prior clinical radiographic history osteoporosis , minimum 1 year hormonal therapy arm 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 6 , ability willingness give inform consent . Exclusion criterion - Patients know bone disorder metastatic disease hyperparathyroidism , Paget 's disease , renal osteodystrophy , document osteomalacia well osteoporosis , patient receive bisphosphonate , systemic fluoride , pharmacological dos calcium ( less 1500 mg/day ) Vitamin D ( less 1000 IU/day ) , calcitonin , patient know abnormal thyroid function , patient mark renal impairment ( creatinine le 2.0 X normal ) . MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS - This outpatient study . All patient initially assess research nurse and/or physician Cross Cancer Institute prostate cancer specific history , blood urine test . Patients refer single endocrinologist detailed osteoporosis history physical exam . On day , densitometry study , whole body composition study , plain radiographs take . Patients see Cross Cancer Institute discus result . Should diagnosis osteoporosis make , letter indicate send patient 's family physician . ENDPOINTS - The primary endpoint bone mineral density . Osteoporosis diagnose T value less -2.5 . The secondary endpoint - biochemical marker bone turnover , vertebral fracture , vertebral body height , body composition fat , body composition adipose tissue . DATA ANALYSIS - The data enter computerized database . Descriptive statistic tabulate 5 arm study respect demographic variable , baseline characteristic , test result .</detailed_description>
