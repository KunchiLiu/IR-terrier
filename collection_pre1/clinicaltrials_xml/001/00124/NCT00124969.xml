Disorders calcium metabolism , calcification vessel wall , occur frequently . There indication calcium channel blocker capable lower cardiovascular mortality patient end-stage renal failure . It intend carry prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study order find calcium channel blocker amlodipine able reduce mortality patient end-stage renal failure . The investigation carry suitable explanation write informed consent 356 patient age 18 90 year end-stage renal failure chronic haemodialysis treatment . The patient randomize either treatment amlodipine 10 mg/day placebo . The occurrence event document evaluated prospectively period 30 month . 4 . Sponsor : There sponsor study . The study initiate study director . The Pfizer company ( Karlsruhe ) support project financially materially . 5 . Trial Center : It plan carry study Berlin/Brandenburg area North Rhine Westphalia . The doctor responsible respective Trial Centers notify Ethics Committee immediately enrolment . At present enrolled Trial Centers . 6 . Ethics Committee : The present Trial Protocol present Ethics Committee Free University Berlin ( chairman : Prof. Dr. med . D. Ganten ) review . 7 . Other Ethics Committees : This Trial Protocol far present institution assessment . 8 . Classification Study : This Phase IV study . The study carry licensed medicament ( amlodipine ) license indication ( hypertension ) . This clinical study patient legally competent capable understanding nature , importance scope clinical trial . 9 . Legal Basis German Medicines Act 1.2 Justification Aim Study : 1 . Aim Hypothesis : The aim study show administration calcium antagonist amlodipine significantly reduce mortality patient end-stage renal failure . Hypothesis : Amlodipine reduce mortality patient end-stage renal failure . 2 . Current Status Research Basis Performance Study : The life expectancy patient end-stage renal failure nowadays still less 10 year . The annual mortality rate patient end-stage renal failure almost 25 % . Death patient end-stage renal failure frequently consequence cardiovascular event . Cardiovascular event patient dialysis-dependent renal failure particularly frequently see traditional risk factor , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia smoking , frequently present group . In addition , also numerous risk factor associate renal failure , increase oxidative stress , inflammatory vascular change , excess salt water load . Important cofactor increase mortality dialysis patient inadequate removal `` uremia toxin '' uremia-induced malnutrition . In patient end-stage dialysis-dependent renal failure , increase calcification coronary vessel , cardiac valve myocardial tissue , well increase calcium x phosphate product frequently see . An association also see increase mortality . Block colleague able show relative mortality risk patient increase calcium x phosphate product increase increased cardiovascular cause death could see . An increased calcium x phosphate product potentiate calcification arterial vascular wall thus produce reduced elasticity . Using electron beam computer tomography could show calcification region coronary vessel observe much frequently patient end-stage renal failure healthy control person . In general population show calcium channel blocker good vasodilator antihypertensive drug . In general population calcium antagonists type long-acting dihydropyridines , verapamil diltiazem use preferentially treatment elderly patient patient isolated systolic hypertension . However , patient end-stage renal failure also profit administration calcium channel blocker , reduce blood pressure , reduce uremia toxin-induced calcinosis vessel produce reduce influx calcium vessel wall . Calcium channel blocker inhibit macrophage proliferation . Calcium channel blocker also reduce raise calcium level B-lymphocytes patient end-stage renal failure . In preliminary retrospective investigation , study director investigate effect administration calcium antagonists mortality . 188 patient end-stage renal failure chronic regular haemodialysis observe 30 month July 1998 . Parameters age , sex , laboratory value , clinical data dialysis dose record . Up December 2000 51 patient die ( 27 % ) . The investigation show advanced age low body-mass index cause increase mortality . In contrast , availability calcium channel blocker favorable . After statistical analysis data use Cox risk-regression model find patient take calcium channel blocker show significantly low mortality ( relative risk 0.22 [ 95 % confidence interval 0.17-0.67 ] p &lt; 0.001 ) . This preliminary investigation thus show use calcium channel blocker significantly lower mortality patient end-stage dialysis-dependent renal failure increase mortality due cardiovascular event . 2 Ethical Aspects : Patients end-stage renal failure exist , history know , arterial hypertension clearly increase mortality cardiovascular event comparison normal population . So far medicament demonstrated study reduce mortality patient dialysis-dependent renal failure . In preliminary study indication calcium channel blocker , particular amlodipine , lead reduction cardiovascular mortality . The investigation carry appropriate explanation give write informed consent obtain patient . Provisions Monitoring Study Ethics Committee : The applicant , Prof. Dr. med . M. Tepel Dr. med . M. van der Giet , prepare enable authorized member Ethics Committee observe trial time . 3 Study Timetable : 3.1 Justification Timetable : Every patient observe period 30 month . Patients end-stage renal failure non-diabetic origin five-year survival expectation 35 - 40 % , whereas patient end-stage renal failure diabetic origin five-year survival rate 20 % ( United States Renal Data System : Annual Data Report 2000 . Am . J. Kidney Dis . 2000 ; 36 Suppl . 2 , p. 127 ) . It therefore assume within 30 month 35 - 40 % examined patient die . This period sufficient observe possible positive effect amlodipine mortality . The medicinal preparation license long-term therapy , negative effect due medicament expect . 4 . General Planning : A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study two group carry order show reduction mortality patient end-stage renal failure . The study carry period 30 month . A check make every six month see event occur . All patient fulfil inclusion criterion prepared participate study randomly assign first issue study medicament one group . The patient receive either amlodipine 10 mg placebo . Both medicament give single daily dose form tablet morning . The study medication change course study , insofar side-effects observe . Patients already take calcium channel blocker , withdrawal phase possible accord opinion physician , first undergo wash-out phase 4 week start double-blind treatment . During study , administration necessary medicament patient , apart administration calcium channel blocker , permit . A check carry interval 6 month see whether event occur . Each patient observe period 30 month . 4.2 Course Study : Visit 1 ( initial examination ) : First patient inform study . If patient consent participate , short clinical history physical examination carry . Then criteria inclusion exclusion check . The blood pressure , pulse rate body mass index determine . Subsequently patient ask previous disease , specific question occurrence diabetes mellitus , coronary heart disease , stroke ( include transitory ischaemic attack [ TIA ] prolong reversible ischaemic neurological deficit [ PRIND ] ) peripheral arterial occlusive disease . The patient enrol study he/she fulfil inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . Should patient take calcium channel blocker time enrolment study , withdrawn insofar attend physician considers possible . Other exist medication retain . The interval Visit 1 Visit 2 one week . Visit 2 ( start study , month 0 ) : The patient 's current medication record ( particular reference follow concomitant medication : ACE inhibitor , AngII blocker , statin , erythropoietin , beta-blockers ) . Questions ask newly develop diseases special attention occurrence diabetes mellitus , coronary heart disease , stroke ( include transitory ischaemic attack [ TIA ] prolong reversible ischaemic neurological deficit [ PRIND ] ) peripheral arterial occlusive disease . The blood pressure , pulse rate body mass index record . Study medication 28 week issue . The patient inform take medicament . Laboratory value record course routine monitoring patient ( abbreviated extensive routine laboratory examination : hemoglobin , leukocyte count , platelet count , calcium , calcium x phosphate product , urea , serum creatinine , total protein , parathyroid hormone , cholesterol , triglyceride ferritin ) . The patient ask current symptom . Visits 3 - 6 ( follow-up observation , month 6 , 12 , 18 24 ) : The current medication patient record ( especial emphasis follow concomitant medication : ACE inhibitor , AngII blocker , statin , erythropoietin , beta-blockers ) . Questions ask newly develop diseases special attention occurrence diabetes mellitus , coronary heart disease , stroke ( include transitory ischaemic attack [ TIA ] prolong reversible ischaemic neurological deficit [ PRIND ] ) peripheral arterial occlusive disease . The blood pressure , pulse rate body mass index record . The study medication count . New supply study medication 28 week issue . Questions ask side-effects . The patient ask current symptom . Laboratory value record course routine monitoring patient ( abbreviated routine laboratory : hemoglobin , leukocyte count , platelet count , calcium , calcium x phosphate product , urea , serum creatinine , total protein ) . Visit 7 ( study closure , month 30 ) : The current medication patient record ( especial emphasis follow concomitant medication : ACE inhibitor , AngII blocker , statin , erythropoietin , beta-blockers ) . Questions ask newly develop diseases special attention occurrence diabetes mellitus , coronary heart disease , stroke ( include transitory ischaemic attack [ TIA ] prolong reversible ischaemic neurological deficit [ PRIND ] ) peripheral arterial occlusive disease . The blood pressure , pulse rate body mass index record . The study medication count . Questions ask side-effects . The patient ask current symptom . Laboratory value record course routine monitoring patient ( abbreviated extensive routine laboratory : hemoglobin , leukocyte count , platelet count , calcium , calcium x phosphate product , urea , serum creatinine , total protein , parathyroid hormone , cholesterol , triglyceride ferritin ) . After complete study , data record unblinding evaluate ( duration 2 month ) prepare publication . Checks Observation Protocol : The study director employ monitor duration study visit center interval six month check observation study protocol . 4.3 Study Medication ( trial preparation , blinding , concomitant medication ) : Amlodipine 10 mg use trial preparation Amlodipine calcium antagonist already license within European Union indication : essential hypertension , chronic stable angina pectoris ( angina effort ) . Placebo use control . 4.3.1 Blinding : All member study team personnel involve course study work blind condition throughout entire period trial . The study director investigator provide randomization code seal envelope . The placebo active drug differ form , color , odor weight . 4.3.2 Actions Unblinding Side-Effects : Blinding essential order maintain integrity study .
