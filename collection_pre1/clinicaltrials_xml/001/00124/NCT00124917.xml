	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : -This study represent progression finding four previous NCI ROB protocol ( 02-C-0167A , 02-C-0207E , 03-C-0190B , 04-C-0171 ) . In previous work begin develop technique obtain MR biological image co-register tissue prostate cancer patient . OBJECTIVES : -The scientific objective protocol determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) external beam radiation region interest within prostate base acute toxicity . Secondary objective study relate pattern gene protein expression response toxicity evaluate frequency late term toxicity . ELIGIBILITY : -Patients prostate cancer without evidence metastasis eligible study . DESIGN : - This phase I trial use intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) deliver escalate dos external beam radiation region histologically confirm prostate cancer . The study conduct use standard 3-6 dose-escalation initial 3 patient dose cohort potential expansion cohort 6 patient . - Anatomic MRI MR biological image , MRS , obtain Tissue acquire site interest , biopsy location precisely translate ( co-registered ) MR image reference . Tissue sample process cDNA microarray test stored future analysis Radiation Oncology Branch , NCI . A gold seed leave biopsy site fiducial marker direct future radiation therapy . If necessary , additional fiducial marker place target localization treatment . - Once MR guide biopsy obtain fiducial marker place , patient undergo standard CT simulation radiation therapy treatment planning . The MR CT image fuse . Areas pathologically confirm malignancy undergo dose escalation describe . Areas image abnormality could biopsied without definite pathologic evidence malignancy give intermediate dos . The remainder prostate gland receive standard dose ( 7560 cGy . ) - The trial accrue 18 36 patient anticipated accrual period 2 year .</brief_summary>
