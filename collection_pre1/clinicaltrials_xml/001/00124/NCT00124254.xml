	<brief_title>Study People With Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Require Joint Surgery Hand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study provide good understand effectiveness SMPA , procedure correct knuckle deformity hand rheumatoid arthritis patient . This study examine whether rheumatoid arthritis patient undergo SMPA good outcome patient surgery . RA affect 2.1 million Americans cost United States estimate $ 8.7 billion annually medical cost wage . RA progressive disease , approximately 25 % RA patient experience hand deformity associate destruction metacarpophalangeal ( MCP ) joint . For past 30 year , SMPA perform patient correct metacarpophalangeal joint deformity rheumatoid hand . SMPA provide pain relief , restoration function , aesthetic improvement patient . However , data limit efficacy , SMPA remain controversial procedure . Hand surgeon rheumatologists frequently disagree indication procedure value patient . In addition , publish study hamper inadequate consideration research design , small sample size , inconsistent outcome measure . The purpose study measure short- long-term outcome follow SMPA . The study also define indication surgery specific patient group disease severity . The experience surgery rheumatology service use jointly evaluate surgical procedure . This study multicenter , international outcome study evaluate RA patient severe MCP joint problem . Patients choose enrolled surgical group undergo SMPA nonsurgical group . Patients evaluate Month 6 annually third year . Patient evaluation base Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire , Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales questionnaire , standard , objective hand function test .</detailed_description>
