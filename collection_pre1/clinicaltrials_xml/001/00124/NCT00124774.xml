	<detailed_description>This study include patient contain lumbar hernia least 6 week existence leg pain predominant complaint . Standard treatment patient conservative , operation without risk always effective . Furthermore , complaint usually resolve due time . However , pain limit patient daily activity , often prolonged period . In study , nucleoplasty compare sham treatment conservative treatment , discography think therapeutic effect . The primary outcome proportion patient least 2.5 point decrease ten-point Jensen VAS score 3 month treatment .</detailed_description>
