	<brief_title>Ultrafiltration Versus Intravenous ( IV ) Diuretics Patients Hospitalized Acute Decompensated Heart Failure : ( UNLOAD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure important public health issue . It remain leading cause hospitalization Medicare beneficiary . Ninety percent hospitalization CHF due fluid overload . Most expense related management heart failure due hospital-based care ; intervention reduce amount time patient spend hospital may greatly decrease cost associate care patient . Hospital stay patient admit acute decompensated congestive heart failure ( adCHF ) largely dictated quickly sign symptom congestion relieve whether ACE inhibitor start safely . Diuretics usually effective relieve congestion , achieve adequate diuresis often require process trial error . Some patient simply refractory oral intravenous diuretic . Diuretics stimulate adverse neurohormonal system cause progressive azotemia . Bayliss ( 1977 ) show significant increase renin aldosterone level response diuretic treatment rather result heart failure . Gottlieb ( 2002 ) show loop diuretic diminish glomerular filtration rate patient heart failure . In addition , diuretic give , serum electrolyte imbalance often occur , require additional monitoring patient . UF use therapeutic method remove excessive fluid patient 30 year . UF remove excess water without cause significant clinical change electrolyte composition blood cause adverse affect kidneys neurohormonal system . Studies show UF increase urine output , increase responsiveness standard oral therapy decrease readmission rate . While usefulness UF patient population great potential , form therapy usually perform due need invasive venous access increase expense i.e . high flow dialysis machine . CHF Solutions develop Aquadex System FDA market clearance UF . The advantage Aquadex System simplicity fact administer mean peripheral catheter central venous access . Early prospective series subsequent clinical experience involve adCHF patient show 4 8 liter easily withdraw short amount time use peripheral access approach Aquadex System . Volume removal associate disruption electrolyte balance , worsen renal distress impact blood pressure heart rate clinical significance . The Aquadex System predictable , safe , effective way ensure adequate volume removal may result short hospital stay , good symptom relief efficient dose medication treatment adCHF . The purpose study determine whether Aquadex System improve acute management patient adCHF maintain improvement period time compare IV diuretic . Ultrafiltration patient population may decrease length hospital stay reduce hospital readmission heart failure lead significant reduction cost treatment patient .</detailed_description>
