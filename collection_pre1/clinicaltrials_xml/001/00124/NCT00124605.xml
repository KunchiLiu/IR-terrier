	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe toxicity combination arsenic trioxide combination pamidronate disodium four dose level . II . To assess pharmacokinetics pamidronate disodium give combination arsenic trioxide . III . Utilizing 2-color immunofluorescence ( IF ) determine treatment combination arsenic trioxide pamidronate disodium affect phosphorylation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) IV . In patient multiple myeloma utilizing western blot evaluate pre- post-treatment level protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B lysates multiple myeloma cell . V. To obtain preliminary data response regimen patient population . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive pamidronate IV 2 hour day 1 15 arsenic trioxide IV 2 hour day 1-5 15-19 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos pamidronate arsenic trioxide maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 12-24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
