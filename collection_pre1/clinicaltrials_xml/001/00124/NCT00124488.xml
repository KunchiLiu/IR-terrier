	<brief_summary>Standard treatment non-operable cervix cancer radiation chemotherapy . This treatment combination result significant radiation side-effects involve bladder , small bowel rectum . To improve result radiation/chemotherapy , high radiation dos try cervix cancer patient . Results use high radiation dose show cervix tumour may better control , radiation side-effects worsen . Intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) Tomotherapy new radiation planning delivery technology may allow delivery high radiation dose less damage normal organ . The purpose project determine whether IMRT and/or Tomotherapy technology produce radiation plan deliver high dos radiation tumor low dos normal organ compare standard radiation plan . The result project provide basis possibly treat future cervix cancer patient Tomotherapy provide improved cure rate along decreased rate radiation side effect . No patient treat protocol , investigator plan compare radiation dose calculation different treatment plan create test cervix cancer case . There absolutely patient contact protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Tomotherapy Versus Intensity-modulated Step-and-shoot Conventional Radiation Treatment Plans Patients With Locally-advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Information : The addition concurrent chemotherapy radiotherapy ( RT ) locally-advanced cervix cancer improve patient outcome , treatment associate significant rate radiotherapy ( RT ) -related toxicity . Plus , disease-free overall survival benefit confer concurrent chemotherapy appear prominent patient earlier stage disease . Limits RT cervix cancer impact patient outcomes overall treatment time RT dose . Attempts overcome limit make trial use altered RT fractionation scheme . Promising rate local control report trial offset excessive rate acute late RT-related toxicity . Intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) innovative RT plan delivery technology ability vary intensity radiation across beam , allow increase conformity RT dose around target volume along decrease dose deliver normal structure . Tomotherapy use intensity-modulated beam rotate around patient patient translate longitudinally gantry feature ability acquire megavoltage CT ( MVCT ) image target structure treatment . It think Tomotherapy plan deliver conformal RT add advantage daily assessment target critical structure position via MVCT image . Experience use IMRT cervix cancer sparse . Reports treat pelvic nodal target small number select cervix cancer patient IMRT suggest treatment tolerable associate decreased incidence acute late RT-related toxicity compare similar patient cohort treat conventional RT technology . Currently , publish report use Tomotherapy plan deliver RT use conventional altered fractionation cervix cancer patient . The limitation overall treatment time maximal dose RT safely deliver pelvis target make cervical carcinoma tumor Tomotherapy potentially improve therapeutic ratio . Tomotherapy 's ability deliver conformal RT target structure minimize dose normal structure may allow delivery altered fractionation radiation plan cervix cancer acceptable rate RT-related toxicity . Tomotherapy allow delivery differential daily dos RT target volume lie within large target volume effect delivers simultaneous integrate boost ( SIB ) area gross disease lie within large volume risk harbouring micrometastases . Delivery boost dose radiation simultaneous oppose sequential fashion decrease overall RT treatment time theoretically reduce effect accelerate tumor cell repopulation . Delivering high dos per fraction area gross disease would theoretically increase radiobiologic enhancement effect concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy . Tomotherapy represent key advance radiotherapy planning delivery technology . Its potential dosimetric radiobiologic advantage standard radiotherapy technology need evaluation properly-conducted clinical trial . Prior initiation trial , must show Tomotherapy plan least dosimetric advantage conventional plan . Objective : To compare radiotherapy ( RT ) plan create locally-advanced cervix cancer case use Tomotherapy , conventional compute tomography-based method step-and-shoot intensity-modulated method . Study Design : Pre-treatment planning compute tomography scan ten previously-treated cervix cancer patient use . All identifying patient data CT image set completely remove . Three RT plan create case : Tomotherapy , step-and-shoot IMRT , conventional . The University Medical Centre Utrecht , The Netherlands implement IMRT clinical management cervical cancer Gynecologic Oncology group graciously agree collaborate project create optimize step-and-shoot IMRT plan ten test case . The anonymous CT image set store data disc send via bond courier University Medical Centre Utrecht , The Netherlands generation step shoot IMRT plan . Data calculate collected plan include : dose-volume histogram ( DVH 's ) target volumes critical structure . Tumor Control Probability target Normal Tissue Complication Probability critical structure calculate . RT plan create protocol use dose biophysical model calculation comparison ; plan use deliver actual radiation treatment patient . There absolutely patient contact interaction protocol . Future Directions : The investigator anticipate result study confirm hypothesis Tomotherapy plan incorporate simultaneous integrate boost cervix cancer provide superior target volume coverage normal critical structure avoidance compare step-and-shoot IMRT conventional plan . Such confirmation provide basis proceed effort improve target normal structure delineation Tomotherapy treatment plan cervix cancer use MRI-based planning . Ultimately , plan initiate phase I/II trial use MRI-based Tomotherapy planning delivery technique cervix cancer patient . Incorporation RT dose escalation monitor treatment response biologic image technique cervix cancer patient treat Tomotherapy future potential area investigation .</detailed_description>
