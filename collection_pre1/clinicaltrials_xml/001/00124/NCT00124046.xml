	<detailed_description>Eight % sixteen % school-aged child approximately 50,000 child British Columbia ( BC ) suffer persistent urinary incontinence ( i.e. , beyond age 5 year , continence usually achieve ) . Prevalence decrease age , yet study indicate 10 % -25 % healthy adolescent young adult also suffer incontinence . Persistent incontinence profound social , emotional behavioral impact , adversely affect quality life affect child family . Typical management incontinence patient include repeated visit family doctor long-term lifestyle change and/or prescription use . Each year BC , family doctor refer 4500 child pediatric urologist BC Children 's Hospital ( BCCH ) . BCCH tertiary care facility child youth province , child parent come BC appointment diagnostic urodynamics test . Of child evaluate pediatric urologist year , approximately 900 ( 20 % ) designate dysfunctional voiding . In group , follow one year non-responsiveness medical treatment ( medication , lifestyle ) , urologist may refer child neurosurgery assessment possible surgery . In recent year , referral rate child incontinence BCCH Neurosurgery increase markedly 1-2 12-15 child per year . This referral urinary incontinence child one clinical feature tether cord syndrome . In syndrome , low end spinal cord ( conus ) pull low normal thicken band tissue call filum terminale , run inferiorly bottom spinal cord . This `` tethered '' condition treat surgical section filum terminale . More recently , concept occult tether cord syndrome ( OTCS ) propose ; OTCS , clinical symptom ( e.g. , incontinence ) consistent tether cord syndrome , conus end normal location . The concept OTCS controversial , yet clear whether section filum appropriate . Filum section relatively minor procedure ( akin appendectomy ) require general anesthesia day surgery . In uncontrolled case series , section filum terminale child OTCS result 60 % -97 % improvement symptom . Given evidence section filum may improve incontinence symptom , urologist keen refer patient neurosurgeon . Furthermore , family demand test option , ready pursue surgery treatment child 's incontinence . This suggest referral rate Neurosurgery continue increase , crucial requirement develop standard policy procedure related offering surgery child incontinence . As yet , however , effectiveness appropriateness surgery evaluate systematically . To investigate matter comparison make two randomized group . One group undergo early tether cord release section filum terminale limit posterior lumbar spinal exposure continue medical therapy 12 month . This group compare second continued standard medical therapy without surgical intervention 12 month . This comparison make base physiological marker urinary incontinence , measure urodynamic scale ; quality life , measure validate enuresis-specific quality life scale . The intervention consider successful improves urodynamic score 20 % , quality life child family significantly improve .</detailed_description>
