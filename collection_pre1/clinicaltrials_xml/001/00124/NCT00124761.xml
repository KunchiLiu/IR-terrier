	<brief_summary>This study examine surgery versus radiosurgery ( highly focus radiation ) treatment cancer spread one spot brain ( solitary brain `` metastasis '' ) . For two treatment option , compare patient ' survival time , quality life , control rate brain metastasis side effect . It use rigorous scientific method available call `` randomisation '' minimises bias exist type study . It involve 30 - 40 patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Radiosurgery With Surgery Solitary Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective - evaluate solitary brain metastasis whether overall survival health relate quality life ( HQoL ) patient treat radiosurgery ( RS ) plus whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) non-inferior patient treat surgery ( S ) plus WBRT . Secondary objectives - compare two treatment arm time local distant brain recurrence , failure free survival , acute late toxicity . Hypothesis - Patients treat RS + WBRT neither bad survival bad quality life treat S + WBRT . Research plan : - Trial design - Single-centre prospective randomise Phase III control two arm non-inferiority study `` gold standard '' surgery ( plus WBRT ) control arm . Blinding trial arm feasible . Stratification Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Recursive Partitioning Analysis ( RPA ) prognostic Class 1 v 2 v 3 . - Main eligibility criteria - single presumed metastasis MRI brain ; systemic cancer diagnose within last 5 year ; consider suitable S RS ; write informed consent . - Main exclusion criterion - surgery indicate life-threatening raise intra-cranial pressure tissue diagnosis ; surgery contra-indicated site medical co-morbidities ; leptomeningeal disease ; primary small cell lung cancer , germ cell tumour , lymphoma , leukaemia myeloma . - Radiation - WBRT dose 30 Gy 10 fraction 2 week . RS dose base lesion size 4 cm ( 15-20 Gy ) . - Surgery - Aim complete excision . - Treatment sequence patient assessment - Any sequence S/RS WBRT allowable , long brain treatment commence within 2 week , complete within 6Â½ week diagnostic MRI brain . Assessments baseline , brain treatment , 2 3 month commencement , 3 monthly , MRI brain 3 6 month , and/or clinically indicate . Acute toxicity monitor NCI Common Toxicity Criteria , late toxicity RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scheme . HQoL assess EORTC QLQ-C30 QLQ-BN20 . - Sample size - 30-40 patient 5 year . Outcomes Significance : The trial enable Level I evidence apply common clinical problem . Patients able make inform choice base upon valid survival , quality life toxicity comparison .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Single presume brain metastasis contrast magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan within two week commencement treatment . Systemic cancer diagnose histologically cytologically synchronous , within 5 year treatment presume brain metastasis ( nonmelanoma skin cancer cancer insitu cervix , neither would reasonably attributable primary site ) . Exception melanoma diagnose &gt; 5 year previously allowable view extremely variable natural history melanoma . Age &gt; = 18 ( upper age limit ) . Considered suitable S RS neurosurgeon radiation oncologist ( see exclusion ) . Patient must agree adjuvant WBRT . RTOG RPA Class 1 2 ( Karnofsky Performance Status [ KPS ] &gt; = 70 adequate trial corticosteroid ) . RPA Class 3 patient ( KPS &lt; 70 ) eligible consider poor performance status due primarily solitary metastasis , aggressive local treatment may expect restore good performance status . This would ordinarily associate minimal systemic disease burden . Accessible treatment followup . Patient infertile aware risk become pregnant father child use adequate contraception . Written inform consent Previous history brain metastasis ( e ) Surgery indicate relieve lifethreatening raise intracranial pressure excision require tissue diagnosis ( extracranial site biopsy ie unknown primary ) . However , prior diagnostic ( nonexcisional ) biopsy allowable acknowledge 50 % probability repeat surgical procedure subsequent randomisation would acceptable many patient clinician . Surgery contraindicate site ( e.g . thalamus , brain stem ) medical comorbidities . Leptomeningeal disease . Primary small cell lung cancer , germ cell tumour , lymphoma , leukaemia myeloma . Prior cranial RT ( include RS ) . Patient pregnant .</criteria>
