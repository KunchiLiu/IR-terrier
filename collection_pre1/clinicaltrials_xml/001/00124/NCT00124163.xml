	<brief_summary>Computed tomography ( CT ) colonography gain widespread multi-disciplinary interest evolve noninvasive colorectal screening examination , potential improve patient compliance . The investigator 's prior work demonstrate bowel preparation least tolerable aspect colorectal evaluation compare CT colonography optical colonoscopy procedure . Stool tagging could provide gentle efficient bowel preparation , few false positive due retain stool-mimicking polyp . The researcher hypothesize image quality patient preference vary stool tag concentration dose schedule . The researcher propose evaluate specific stool tagging protocol follow aim : AIM 1 : Perform randomize trial three specific stool tagging protocol use barium iodine CT colonography well-characterized cohort patient undergoing colorectal evaluation . AIM 2 : Analyze CT colonography optical colonoscopy data ass difference across stool tagging protocols outcome measure patient preference , image quality presence tagging , diagnostic reader performance . The researcher use specific variation stool tag technique determine best image quality CT data ( e.g. , homogenous tag fluid stool ) , high patient acceptability , well evaluate adequacy preparation same-day colonoscopy . Diagnostic reader performance focus accuracy detect neoplastic lesion include colon cancer , adenomatous polyp , sessile adenoma flat adenoma . Most importantly , result help inform design large trial optimize CT colonography technique community setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CT Colonography , rapidly evolve technique , offer noninvasive efficient colorectal screening examination , potential improve patient compliance . However , currently require bowel preparation , one large barrier colonoscopy screen . A promising new tool CT Colonography stool tagging , potential decrease amount catharsis require patient bowel preparation , decrease number false positive due reader mistake residual stool polyp . Our primary hypothesis image quality patient compliance differ depend upon tag agent dose schedule . Our strategy vary key component recently report barium iodine protocol optimize compare result exist currently aggregate data collaboration investigator . The follow aim implement strategy : AIM 1 : Perform randomize control trial specific stool tagging protocol CT Colonography well characterize cohort patient undergoing colorectal evaluation . Task 1A - Recruit prospective cohort 60 subject , randomize equally three different stool tagging protocol , sequentially perform CT Colonography optical colonoscopy . Task 1B - Assess image quality CT Colonography optical colonoscopy data method bowel preparation first five subject arm implement specific change , necessary . AIM 2 : Analyze CT Colonography optical colonoscopy data ass difference across study arm outcome measure patient preference , image quality tag stool , diagnostic reader performance . Task 2A : Assess patient expectation regard bowel preparation , CT Colonography colonoscopy procedure preferences procedure . Task 2B : Evaluate image quality , presence tag stool fluid , CT data colonoscopy data . Task 2C : Perform multi-observer reader evaluation diagnostic performance CT Colonography colonoscopy , compare enhance reference standard colonoscopy aid segmental unblinding CT result , assess sensitivity specificity colorectal polyp detection . Upon completion , three specific variation stool tag technique compare homogenous density tag patient acceptability determine protocol optimize trade-off . Diagnostic performance CT colonoscopy compare enhance reference standard colonoscopy aid segmental unblinding CT result . Most significantly , result may help determine optimal tag protocol use large trial CT Colonography implementation community setting .</detailed_description>
