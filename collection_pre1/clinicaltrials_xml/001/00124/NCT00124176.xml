	<brief_summary>This study use randomize , double-blind , control trial design order ass safety efficacy levalbuterol ( LEV ) compare racemic albuterol ( RAC ) deliver continuously high-dose regimen child severe exacerbation asthma . Primary hypothesis - Children severe asthma receive continuous levalbuterol short duration continuous therapy compare racemic albuterol . Secondary hypothesis - Children receive continuous levalbuterol improve lung function measure forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) compare racemic albuterol . - Children receive continuous levalbuterol improve clinical asthma score compare racemic albuterol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High-dose nebulized albuterol standard therapy severe asthma exacerbation The Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) tertiary care pediatric hospital throughout United States . For severe exacerbation , albuterol provide continuously high dos improvement observe . This regimen standardized treatment protocol use CHOP 5 year . Recently , levalbuterol ( LEV ) , purify active ( R ) -enantiomer albuterol , approve use acute asthma . Preliminary evidence suggest LEV may improve pulmonary function clinical outcome child asthma base study use standard dosing regimen . Laboratory clinical evidence suggest ( S ) -enantiomer albuterol may detrimental effect contribute poor response racemic albuterol ( RAC ) . Limited data exist efficacy LEV high-dose regimen . This study use randomize , double-blind , control trial design order ass safety efficacy LEV compare RAC deliver continuously high-dose regimen severe exacerbation asthma . Children treat asthma exacerbation CHOP emergency department ( ED ) eligible study enrollment . Those meet enrollment criterion randomize receive either high dose RAC accord standard asthma care protocol equivalent dose LEV . Approximately 128 patient 64 arm study enrol . An interim safety analysis conduct first 40 patient enrol . This study complete six nine month . The primary outcome duration continuous therapy . Secondary outcome include improvement clinical asthma score change force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) . In addition , ( R ) -albuterol ( S ) -albuterol level measure study entry 6-hour interval first 40 patient enrol . These value use determine prior RAC exposure determine serum level ( R ) ( S ) albuterol continuous therapy .</detailed_description>
