	<detailed_description>Hyperglycaemia present 40-60 % patient acute ischaemic stroke adversely affect survival outcome . This effect independent stroke severity pathology , strike patient without recognised diabetes , odds death increase threefold , chance poor functional outcome 40 % . Hyperglycaemia remain powerful independent predictor outcome even face thrombolytic drug therapy . The adverse effect hyperglycaemia hypothesise consequent increase provision substrate hypoperfused tissue metabolise anaerobically , resultant tissue accumulation neurotoxic lactic acid . In animal model stroke , hyperglycaemia cause increase tissue lactic acidosis increase recruitment ischaemic tissue peri-infarct region final infarct . Infarct volumes high hyperglycaemic animal , conversely , reduce blood glucose reduces infarct volume . Although clinical observational study suggest protocol incorporate blood glucose monitoring control beneficial , trial ongoing define impact routine treatment maintain euglycaemia , basic pathophysiology stroke relation blood glucose well defined man . Preliminary study confirm relationship blood glucose lactate concentration hypoperfused brain tissue unknown whether brain lactate reduce control blood glucose , whether impact stroke evolution . It also find infarct volume increase hyperglycaemic patient treat recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA ) . MRI permit non-invasive serial study acute stroke pathophysiology . In addition brain structure , MRI define tissue viability ( cytotoxic oedema see diffusion-weighted imaging , DWI ) , brain perfusion ( bolus-tracking perfusion imaging , PI ) , vascular integrity ( MR angiography , MRA ) tissue metabolism ( 1H MR spectroscopy , MRS ) . In acute middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) occlusion , evolution cerebral damage define technique . The volume hypoperfused tissue PI initially exceed DWI lesion , , time , DWI lesion expand finally incorporate majority PI lesion . The region tissue normal DWI abnormal PI think correspond `` ischaemic penumbra '' , region hypoperfusion cause electrical failure neurones progression infarction time due adverse metabolic neurochemical event . The fate penumbra may determine treatment – e.g . salvage thrombolysis – penumbral region vulnerable hyperglycaemia-related lactic acidosis . Glucose lower insulin inexpensive , widely applicable treatment . However , current clinical trial compromise uncertainty ability treatment influence pathophysiology , necessarily rely upon `` best guess '' treatment duration . Definition biological basis insulin treatment MRI criterion comparative data different treatment duration would strengthen inform positive effect clinical trial , prevent premature abandonment therapeutic modality trial neutral .</detailed_description>
