	<brief_summary>- The purpose study find combination lenalidomide radiation therapy effective control tumor growth patient newly-diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma gliosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Lenalidomide XRT Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients receive lenalidomide orally daily 21 day follow one week rest period ( equivalent one cycle ) . - Four seven day first dose lenalidomide , patient start radiation therapy approximately 6-7 week . - A neurologic exam routine blood test perform weekly patient receive radiation therapy . - Following 11th week treatment MRI/CT scan perform assess status tumor . If change , shrinkage size tumor , treatment continue another 4 week cycle . - The four week cycle continue long disease remain stable improve patient develop intolerable side effect . A MRI/CT scan do every 2 cycle ( 8 week ) .</detailed_description>
