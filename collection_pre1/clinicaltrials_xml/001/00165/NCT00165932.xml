	<brief_summary>At Children 's Healthcare Atlanta , child irregular heart rhythm often referred evaluation . Sometimes also need procedure correct irregular heart rhythm . An echocardiogram routinely use part evaluation follow-up . The echocardiogram include Tissue Doppler Imaging ( TDI ) work bounce sound wave heart similar radar . A new echocardiogram technology , Tissue Synchronization Imaging ( TSI ) , help doctor look heart function compare heart rhythm . All three noninvasive , mean work probe outside body painful . The purpose study see Tissue Synchronization Imaging work patient heart rhythm problem . We use patient heart irregularity . We also look child young adult normal heart function establish normal value TSI . All pediatric patient approach study receive echocardiogram recommend cardiologist ( standard care ) , plus TSI , new part heart ultrasound The young adult population undergo heart ultrasound plus TSI . This young adult population select medical student Emory University . During consent process , medical student inform participation voluntary decide participate , affect grade , etc .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There grow body evidence interventricular dyssynchrony result abnormal ventricular mechanic may detrimental myocardial performance . ( 1 ; 2 ) Adult patient LBBB , dilate cardiomyopathy CHF increasingly treat novel pacing technique order restore electrical mechanical synchrony . ( 3-5 ) This technique , biventricular resynchronization pacing , involve insertion specialize cardiac pacing system maintain atrioventricular synchrony , also restore interventricular synchrony simultaneously activate right left ventricle . There number clinical trial ( MIRACLE , MUSTT , INSYNC ) reveal marked clinical improvement adult patient moderate-to-severe CHF . ( 6-8 ) There small report acute effect biventricular pace pediatric patient acquire interventricular dysynchrony either repair palliation congenital heart defect , chronic standard pace one ventricular chamber ( single-site ventricular pacing ) . ( 9-11 ) One main hurdle encounter evaluate patient lack reliable , reproducible non-invasive imaging modality . Recent report show promising result relatively new technique know tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) . ( 12-14 ) TDI echocardiography recently employ non-geometric measure myocardial systolic diastolic performance leave right ventricle . Utilizing low velocity signal discrete point myocardial wall , motion assess variety condition non-invasively . Additionally two point along ventricular wall simultaneously assay , relative motion two point estimate myocardial systolic strain direction Doppler sound beam . This technique eliminate variation due translational motion heart . Tissue synchronization assess time peak systolic motion different point along myocardium relative either QRS electrocardiogram mechanical indicator systole aortic valve opening . Recent advance software design create technology simultaneously depict peak velocity entire myocardium view 2-dimensional echo image . This promote easy identification dysynchronous segment . By subsequently apply discrete cursor area , graphic pattern velocity direction myocardial motion drawn quantitative analysis . The application new sophisticated tool allow good analysis electromechanical dysynchrony may enable definition criterion , use identify patient benefit cardiac resynchronization therapy . We identify 4 group patient allow u prospectively systematically evaluate TSI young population . The first group patient supraventricular tachycardia Wolff-Parkinson-White ( WPW ) syndrome . These patient accessory AV connection ( AC ) allow electrical activity bypass normal AV node excite ventricle prematurely . In , result loss normal , midline ventricular activation pattern dysynchronous activation pattern . There small report chronic ventricular dysynchrony potential playing role depress myocardial performance . ( 15 ) Standard therapy patient WPW clinical SVT include invasive intracardiac electrophysiology study ( EPS ) possible radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) order eliminate AC . These patient leave normal conduction AV node , presumably restore midline activation sequence . The second group patient child SVT evidence ventricular preexcitation ( i.e. , WPW ) . These patient normal , midline ventricular activation pattern sinus rhythm . Standard treatment child afflict variant SVT would also include EPS RFA . As part standard EPS , patient receive intermittent atrial ventricular pacing . The result transient ventricular pace presumably dysynchronous activation pattern could evaluate TSI . With pacing , normal activation pattern restore . Therefore , patient also serve control . The third group essentially normal ( normal 4 chamber anatomy ) pediatric patient refer echocardiogram evaluate possible heart murmur , syncope chest pain . Their data use establish normal pediatric value TSI . The fourth group normal ( normal 4 chamber anatomy ) young adult subject recruit participation study . Their data use establish normal adult value TSI . These value result compare three pediatric group .</detailed_description>
