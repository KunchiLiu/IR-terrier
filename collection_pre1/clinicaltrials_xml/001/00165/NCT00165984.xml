	<brief_summary>There many kid bear congenital heart disease . Some defect may lead formation single ventricle ( heart one pump chamber ) . These child normally undergo series corrective surgery help overcome problem one ventricle . However difference well patient respond surgery . In adult population , study show may genetic link may responsible difference patient respond . The investigator would like study pediatric population look certain genetic marker patient ' blood . They also collect basic health information patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Genetic Polymorphisms Ventricular Structure Function Patients With Single Ventricle Anatomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , approximately 30,000 child bear congenital heart disease every year . Between 1000 2000 child form functional single ventricle anatomy , variant hypoplastic leave heart syndrome ( HLHS ) comprise half . Patients functional single ventricle anatomy bear malformation render one ventricle unusable surgically unrecoverable . In HLHS , example , either mitral aortic valve absent significantly stenotic , generally associate marked hypoplasia leave ventricle ascend aorta . Other common variant single ventricle anatomy tricuspid pulmonary atresia , often associate degree right ventricular hypoplasia , unbalanced atrioventricular defect , either ventricle unusable due malposition interventricular septum , heterotaxy syndrome . All congenital cardiac anomaly , well several less common variant , treat multi-stage surgical palliation usually require three surgical procedure first three year life . At completion series palliative procedure child leave single functional ventricle drive blood flow systemic circulation pulmonary circulation derive passive drainage systemic venous return pulmonary vasculature . This arrangement , so-called `` Fontan physiology '' , provide excellent quality life child grow enter young adulthood ; however , mean normal hemodynamic arrangement significant percentage child single ventricle anatomy fail either early palliative step point achieve final Fontan palliation . Failure single ventricle patient progress multi-stage palliation late failure patient Fontan procedure result myriad cause . While ventricular dysfunction common find fail single ventricle patient , anatomic reason clinical failure , myocardial ischemia ventricular outflow obstruction , often identify . Many patient subsequently die require cardiac transplantation single ventricle fails . Because patient outcome highly variable despite similar anatomy hemodynamics , suggest genetic variability may play role ability patient tolerate long-term single ventricle palliation . The interaction genetic variability outcomes well documented adult patient cardiovascular disease . Genetic polymorphism renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) particular well study . The active final product RAS angiotensin-II , produce sequential cleavage angiotensinogen ( AGT ) renin angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) . Several step series enzymatic reaction evaluate candidate gene influence cardiovascular disorder . Polymorphisms AGT gene associate essential hypertension , however , subsequent study fail demonstrate influence polymorphism outcome patient idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy . A polymorphism ACE gene involve 287-base pair insertion ( I ) deletion ( D ) evaluate several study . The DD genotype associate high serum level ACE angiotensin II , increase incidence sudden death patient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , increased mortality patient idiopathic heart failure , decrease exercise tolerance patient congestive heart failure . Meanwhile , genetic variant Angiotensin II type 2-receptor ( AT2-R ) show influence leave ventricular structure function young men hypertension . Another potentially important contributor ventricular function study regard genetic polymorphism relate variability Beta1-adrenergic receptor ( Beta1-AR ) . The Beta1-AR primary myocardial receptor catecholamine epinephrine norepinephrine , increase myocardial contractility blood pressure . Several polymorphisms Beta1-AR gene associate increase risk congestive heart failure exercise capacity patient ischemic idiopathic cardiomyopathy . A final area interest oppose system vasodilator vasoconstrictor control systemic vascular tone . Two major contributor vasomotor tone human endothelium derive vasodilator nitric oxide ( NO ) powerful vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 . Endothelial NO produce enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) . A single base-pair polymorphism ( G894T ) associate increase risk vasospastic angina pectoris increase vascular responsiveness phenylephrine patient cardiopulmonary bypass . Meanwhile , single base-pair polymorphism preproendothelin-1 ( pp-ET1 ) gene ( G5665T ) show increase vasomotor reactivity human mammary artery . This polymorphism also associate hypertension overweight patient T allele . While little data available regard cause failure child single ventricle anatomy , clear genetic factor influence ventricular function development heart failure adult two ventricle could play role failure patient one ventricle . We propose combine retrospective prospective evaluation candidate gene polymorphism discuss potential linkage poor outcome child single ventricle anatomy . Poor outcome child would define multi-endpoint variable include death , evaluation heart transplantation , development severe single ventricle dysfunction echocardiographic cardiac catheterization criterion . Identification high-risk combination genetic allele could guide therapy patient poor predict outcome , possibly steer patient towards early transplantation rather attempt staged palliation .</detailed_description>
