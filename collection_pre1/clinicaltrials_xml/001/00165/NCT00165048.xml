	<brief_title>Selective COX-II Inhibitor Palliative Therapy Patients With R1 R2 Resection Disseminated Stomach Cancer - A Multi-Centre Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cyclo-oxygenase ( COX ) family enzymes regulate conversion arachidonic acid prostaglandin . COX-II inducible enzyme , express excessively stimuli inflammation hypergastrinaemia . Up 40 % patient stomach cancer find disseminate disease surgical exploration . While palliative resection could offer marginal benefit survival patient , almost patient die progression disease within short time span . Palliative chemotherapy use past . However , evidence chemotherapy confer survival advantage , side-effects toxicity treatment may indeed compromise quality life patient . With good understand relation COX-II stomach cancer , may possible suppress progression residual cancer cell palliative resection give patient selective COX-II inhibitor .</detailed_description>
