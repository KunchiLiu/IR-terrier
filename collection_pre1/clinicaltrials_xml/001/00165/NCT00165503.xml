	<brief_summary>The purpose study : determine feasibility administer adjuvant cisplatin plus ALIMTA patient undergo surgery heat cisplatin surgery ; determine effect ( good bad ) combine modality approach patient mesothelioma ; evaluate cisplatin effect determine go excrete body collection tissue cisplatin sample ; collect analyze discard sample mesothelioma tumor surgery help determine genetic make-up disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pleurectomy/Decortication With Intraoperative Intrathoracic/Intraperitoneal Heated Cisplatin With Sodium Thiosulfate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine feasibility administer adjuvant cisplatin plus Alimta patient undergo surgery hyperthermic cisplatin . Secondary - To determine morbidity mortality treatment protocol - To determine time tumor recurrence patient survival - To evaluate pharmacokinetics intraoperatively administer cisplatin DETAILS : - Patients undergo surgery , part standard care mesothelioma , procedure call pleurectomy/decortication . This involve removal line lung visible disease . Resection line heart muscle separate chest abdomen occasionally necessary . - Mesothelioma sample take surgery . These sample use laboratory study well understand genetic makeup mesothelioma improve ability diagnose disease . - After conclusion surgery , patient le 1cm thickness residual gross disease one area , patient continue study . If volume tumor present , patient receive additional treatment off-study . - Heated chemotherapy ( cisplatin ) give operate room immediately follow surgery . This treatment consist one-hour lavage chest abdominal cavity heat cisplatin surgical incision . At completion hour , sodium thiosulfate give intravenously 6 hour reduce potential side effect . - During surgery four hour follow completion cisplatin lavage , blood sample , urine sample , chest wall muscle sample , sample chemotherapy solution take order measure concentration chemotherapy impact cisplatin sample . - Patients remain hospital recover surgery ( 7-14 day ) . In addition standard post-operative care , blood test do daily basis . Following discharge hospital , patient see 1-2 week post-operatively additional blood work . An echocardiogram do 6 week 6 month post-operatively assess heart function . - Chemotherapy treatment consist ALIMTA plus cisplatin Day 1 every 21-day chemotherapy cycle . A total 3 cycle give start 6-10 week surgery . - Folic acid , vitamin B12 dexamethasone give addition chemotherapy help reduce side effect chemotherapy drug . - Approximately 30 day last dose ALIMTA plus cisplatin , CT scan ( ) blood work perform . In addition , patient get CT scan ( ) every 3 month approximately 24 month completion study treatment . - Long term follow-up consist clinic visit every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , year .</detailed_description>
