	<brief_title>Multi-Center Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing Standard Esophagectomy Against Chemo-Radiotherapy Treatment Squamous Esophageal Cancer – Early Results From Chinese University Research Group Esophageal Cancer ( CURE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer oesophagus notorious grave prognosis overall 5-year survival rate 10-20 % . Surgical resection curative intent remain effective treatment disease . To improve survival , well treatment approach need manage patient oesophageal cancer . Unfortunately , use preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy adjuvant radiotherapy confer survival benefit patient localized oesophageal cancer proven randomize study . However , combination chemotherapy radiotherapy great clinical efficacy achieve complete pathological regression tumour well response rate show preliminary result . In fact , treatment squamous oesophageal cancer primary chemo-irradiation without surgery feasible . We propose conduct multi-center randomize trial evaluate efficacy patient ’ survival compare primary chemo-irradiation without surgery versus standard surgical resection treatment squamous oesophageal cancer . Those patient residual cancer primary chemo-irradiation salvage oesophagectomy control disease . Over 3-year period , total 80 patient recruit 4 different hospital 100 patient randomize treatment arm . Treatment outcomes compare intention-to-treat analysis basis .</detailed_description>
