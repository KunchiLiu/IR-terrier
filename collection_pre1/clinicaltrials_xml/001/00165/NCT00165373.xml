	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety rhEndostatin , determine much drug stay patient blood ( pharmacokinetics ) , assess development protein blood produce body ( antibody ) use rhEndostatin , determine effect rhEndostatin formation new blood vessel factor , perform analysis effect rhEndostatin circulate endothelial precursor cell ( cell body help tumor build blood vessel ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Patients receive rhEndostatin intravenously continuously 28 day enrol one 2 dose group . - During initial course treatment , subject evaluate treatment-related side effect . If side effect disease progression , may receive additional 28 day continuous rhEndostatin . - During infusion rhEndostatin , blood sample collect , drug give determine much drug stay blood . Blood drawn day 1 , 8 , 22 29 . After completion therapy , blood sample collect least 3 day determine level ( ) rhEndostatin still patient blood . - Blood and/or urine sample determine immune reaction rhEndostatin well molecule tumor may use stimulate new blood vessel growth drawn start study well completion 28-day cycle completion study . - When tumor-specific marker use monitor status disease present , blood sample measurement marker obtain start study well cycle . - Appropriate imaging study ( MRI , CT scan , x-ray ) do completion first two 28-day cycle completion 28-day cycle duration therapy . - Treatment continue 1 year may extend drug well tolerate disease progression occur .</detailed_description>
