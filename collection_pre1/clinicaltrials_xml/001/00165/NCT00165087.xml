	<brief_title>Treatment Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Children acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) treat somewhat differently depend upon relative risk leukemia recur . For study classify `` Standard Risk '' , `` High Risk '' `` Infant/High Risk '' . - The treatment patient `` Standard Risk '' `` High Risk '' group consist three phase therapy : induction treatment ; prevention brain spinal cord leukemia ( CNS treatment ) ; intensification/continuation chemotherapy . - The treatment patient `` Infant/High Risk '' group consist four phase therapy : induction treatment ; infant intensification therapy ; intensification/continuation chemotherapy ; CNS treatment . - The induction treatment consist combination chemotherapy drug whose purpose kill detectable leukemia cell . This process usually require least one month include six anti-leukemia drug . These drug : vincristine , doxorubicin , methotrexate , cytosine arabinoside , asparaginase steroid ( methylprednisolone prednisone ) . - After induction phase , `` Infant/High Risk '' patient receive highly intensive month treatment ( infant intensification ) . Drugs use month include high-dose methotrexate , asparaginase , 6-mercaptopurine high dose cytosine arabinoside ( ARA-C ) . - CNS treatment begin induction therapy intensify second third month diagnosis . Treatment patient include series spinal tap instillation anti-leukemia drug , include cytosine arabinoside methotrexate without hydrocortisone ( depend upon randomization ) . - All high risk patient ( `` High Risk '' `` Infant/High Risk '' ) well standard risk patient receive radiation treatment brain . Radiation therapy either give either `` conventional '' treatment ( daily 10 day ) , `` hyperfractionated '' treatment ( twice daily half dose 10 day ) . Total dose radiation 1800 cGy . - Intensification continuation therapy , begin 4-5 week diagnosis `` Standard Risk '' `` High Risk '' group 4-5 week infant intensification `` Infant/High Risk '' group . This phase treatment continue completion two year treatment . Patients `` Standard Risk '' group receive five anti-leukemia drug ( vincristine , prednisone , methotrexate , asparaginase , 6-mercaptopurine ) . Patients `` High Risk '' `` Infant/High Risk '' receive six anti-leukemia drug ( vincristine , prednisone , doxorubicin , methotrexate , asparaginase 6-mercaptopurine ) . - All patient able participate randomization compare two type asparaginase , E.coli Erwinia . Patients randomize receive either weekly E.coli once-weekly Erwinia Intensification phase , give total 20 week . - Patients `` Standard Risk '' group able participate additional randomization . Standard risk patient randomize receive one two different regimen design prevent central nervous system leukemia , either 1 ) radiation therapy ( give twice daily ) chemotherapy spinal fluid every 18 week , 2 ) intensive chemotherapy spinal fluid alone without radiation . - Patients `` High Risk '' `` Infant/High Risk '' group able participate two randomization addition asparaginase randomization . The first ass whether drug dexrazoxane prevents heart damage cause doxorubicin without affect risk relapse . Patients randomize receive either doxorubicin alone doxorubicin dexrazoxane induction , CNS intensification phase . The second randomization compare relative efficacy toxicity different cranial radiation schedule . Patients randomize receive radiation either daily twice daily fraction . - Blood bone marrow sample collect learn biology leukemia . These sample also use test minimal residual disease level learn level help predict risk relapse . - Quality life questionnaire also perform parent patient , child eight , child 's clinician .</detailed_description>
