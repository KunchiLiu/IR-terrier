	<brief_title>Resolution Endoclips Vs Epinephrine Injection Heater Probe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mortality peptic ulcer bleeding remain high despite advance endoscopy medical therapy . Endoscopic therapy effectively control peptic ulcer bleed substantially reduce recurrent bleeding . However , best endoscopic therapy still unclear . The current standard therapy injection dilute epinephrine heater probe ( 3.2mm ) thermo-coagulation . However , may associate complication precipitation myocardial ischemia heater probe perforation . Endoscopic clip emerge modality endoscopic treatment , mimic use surgical ligature bleed artery . Endo-clipping theoretical advantage injection heater probe tissue reaction damage much milder . Resolution Clip™ newly develop endo-clipping device . It superior old generation endo-clips allows repeat closure re-opening clip facilitate accurate deployment onto bleed artery ensure optimal placement hemostasis . Consecutive patient endoscopically confirm bleed peptic ulcer invite participate double-blind , randomise trial , compare efficacy Resolution clip conventional dual endoscopic therapy . Patients compare 30-day treatment failure rate .</detailed_description>
