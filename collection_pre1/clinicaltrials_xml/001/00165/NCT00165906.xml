	<brief_summary>Children open heart surgery must heart-lung bypass machine . It essential blood heart-lung machine clot . This accomplished give drug call heparin , `` blood thinner '' . The process make clot involve lot step . One step involve protein call thrombin . Heparin act thrombin keep blood clotting . A technique developed measure blood 's ability generate thrombin . The blood 's ability generate thrombin measure thrombin generation curve ( TGC ) . This curve would helpful know choose dose heparin . We n't find study use TGC baby less month old . We want study compare TGC 10 newborn without heart defect TGC 10 newborn congenital heart defect . To need one sample blood . sample need 3 cc little 1/2 teaspoon . The blood sample group take intravenous catheter ( IV ) child place surgery . The newborn without heart defect child surgery non-cardiac problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neonates unique due maturational difference coagulation system . During first month life , distinct difference exist coagulation system neonate adult include difference concentration coagulation protein , ability generate thrombin ability inhibit thrombin form ( 1 ) . One important coagulant protein quantitatively deficient first several month life prothrombin . In coagulation cascade , prothrombin convert thrombin , major regulator hemostasis . In healthy newborn mean prothrombin value less 70 % adult mean value ( 1 ) , investigator find neonatal prothrombin level directly proportional amount thrombin generate ( 1 ) . In fact , impaired ability newborn plasma generate thrombin face deficient prothrombin show similar adult treat therapeutically anticoagulant ( 2 ) . Therefore , low prothrombin level neonates important implication consider anticoagulant therapy . For neonate congenital heart disease present cardiac surgery , anticoagulation cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) necessary prevent clot blood come contact unphysiologic surface extracorporeal circuit . This achieve use high dose heparin , use inhibit formation activation thrombin . Since neonatal prothrombin level low , render unable generate large amount thrombin , neonates congenital heart disease require anticoagulation CPB historically consider heparin sensitive ( 3 ) . However , recent investigation conduct group , elevate baseline level thrombin production activity consistently find neonate present cardiac surgery ( 4 ) . Additionally , despite routine heparin dosing , elevate marker thrombin production also find neonate CPB compare adult counterpart ( 4 ) . Perhaps assumption neonate congenital heart disease similar healthy neonate impaired ability generate thrombin incorrect . Contact activation may occur preoperatively presence indwell umbilical catheter central line interventional manipulation cardiac catheterization lab stimulate coagulation system generate thrombin anticipate . Elevated thrombin level neonates present cardiac surgery would consequently important implication determine optimal heparin dose need provide adequate anticoagulation CPB . A technique develop monitor thrombin generate capacity plasma ( 5 ) . A thrombin generation curve ( TGC ) construct sample plasma area TGC , call endogenous thrombin potential ( ETP ) , good indicator coagulability sample . Currently , find publish data address TGC neonatal population . Therefore , propose prospective study neonate congenital heart disease present cardiac surgery healthy neonate compare respective ability generate thrombin measure TGCs .</detailed_description>
