	<brief_title>Intensive Chemo-Radiotherapy With Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Rescue Children With Advanced Neuroblastoma Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The treatment separate three stage : 1 ) Initial treatment-chemotherapy stem cell collection ; 2 ) Treatment target directly main tumor-surgery radiation therapy ; 3 ) Intensified treatment : two stem cell transplant . - Patients receive intensive treatment combination seven drug give every 3 week , soon patient 's blood count within safe limit . A total 5 6 course chemotherapy give . The third fourth course follow stem cell collection last course follow bone marrow harvest preparation transplant . - The first treatment involve high-dose Cisplatin intravenously day 5 day VP-16 intravenously day 2,3 4 treatment . - The second course treatment involve cyclophosphamide intravenously day 1 day 2 , adriamycin intravenously continuously 48 hour , vincristine intravenously day 1 . - The third course treatment involve ifosfamide daily day 1-5 VP-16 day 1-3 . Mesna also give prevent bladder irritation . - During fourth course patient receive , carboplatin intravenously day 1 2 VP-16 day 1,2 3 treatment . - The fifth course treatment identical second course . - G-CSF ( granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ) stimulate bone marrow produce white blood cell give subcutaneously patient ' white blood cell count acceptable level . This may require 10-14 day G-CSF treatment . - After first two treatment , last course treatment , patient evaluate response . If significant tumor still present bone marrow third treatment , stem cell collection delay . If bone marrow still show disease next treatment , plan treatment stop . - Patients may undergo surgery last treatment remove tumor evaluate remain disease . After recovery , radiation therapy may perform main tumor area . - Patients receive transplantation stem cell twice study . After preparative treatment , half patient 's stored stem cell give intravenously . Until stem cell restore safe level blood cell , patient hospitalize ( 3-4 week longer ) . - The first treatment begin high dos carboplatin VP-16 daily 3 consecutive day follow cyclophosphamide fourth fifth day . - Between 4-6 week start first course high dose chemotherapy second course consist melphalan total body irradiation ( TBI ) give . Melphalan give daily 3 consecutive day follow TBI twice day 3 day . - After two high dose treatment outline , stem cell previously harvest patient give back central line . - Stem cell collect 3 separate occasion follow two cycle chemotherapy . They process use technique attempt separate stem cell cell , include cancer cell may present . - Bone marrow also harvest prior first transplant use blood count recover stem cell give .</detailed_description>
