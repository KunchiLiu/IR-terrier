	<brief_title>Wide Excision Alone Treatment Ductal Carcinoma Situ The Breast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients DCIS usually treat combination breast-conserving surgery radiation therapy breast-conserving surgery alone . The purpose study evaluate whether localized low- intermediate-grade DCIS , diagnose modern mammography careful pathologic evaluation , could treat wide excision alone ( omission radiation therapy ) result acceptably low local recurrence rate . - Follow-up consist physical examination least every 6 month surgeon radiation oncologist . Mammograms affect breast obtain every 6 month 5 year annually . Mammograms unaffected breast perform annually .</detailed_description>
