	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether bevacizumab help 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) deliver tumor efficiently . Bevacizumab show inhibit formation new blood vessel tumor work best combination drug require blood vessel transportation . Based experiment , bevacizumab may work improve transportation drug tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Positron Emission Tomography Evaluate Effects Bevacizumab Intra-tumoral Pharmacokinetics 5-fluorouracil Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This treatment study . A treatment regimen already decide upon patient doctor . - At screen visit trial follow perform : medical history , physical examination , CT scan measure amount size tumor ( ) , PET scan use glucose attach small amount radioactivity determine well tumor take glucose . - Patients randomize one 2 treatment group . Group 1 receive 5-FU bevacizumab first day chemotherapy . Group 2 receive 5-FU first day chemotherapy . - Patients undergo PET scan us water attach small amount radioactivity measure well tumor take water prior 5-FU adminstration . - After patient receive 5-Fu undergo PET scan small amount 5-FU attach small amount radioactivity measure well tumor take 5-FU .</detailed_description>
