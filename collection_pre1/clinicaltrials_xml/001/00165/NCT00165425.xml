	<brief_title>Cardiac Screening Survivors Hodgkin 's Disease Treated With Mediastinal Irradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- On day patient 's schedule follow-up visit oncologist , additional blood work obtain patient fill questionnaires concern general health assess quality life . - A separate cardiology visit preventative cardiologist perform . At visit , patient undergo Stress Echocardiogram . - A Stress Echocardiogram make three part : Resting echo study , stress test repeat echo heart still beat fast . - A resting echo provide baseline examination demonstrate size function various chamber heart . - The stress test involve exercise use treadmill stationary bike . In patient unable complete high level exercise due physical limitation , stress heart provide pharmaceutical chemical stimulation heart . Exercise start slow , warm-up speed increase every 3 minute . Exercise abruptly stop patient exceeds 85 % target rate . EKG recording make every minute exercise exercise stop . Blood pressure record three minute interval exercise rest . - Immediately exercise stop , patient undergo repeat echocardiogram . - If cardiac abnormality detect , screen test repeat every 3 year , patient le 10 year initial treatment . If patient 10 year initial treatment , test repeat approximately 18 month initial screening end third year .</detailed_description>
