	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine well patient non-small cell lung cancer respond cetuximab plus vinorelbine . We would also like determine safety cetuximab plus vinorelbine people 70 year age old advance non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab Vinorelbine Elderly Subjects With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Each cycle study treatment 21 day long . Cetuximab administer weekly intravenously day 1 , 8 15 21-day cycle . - Vinorelbine administer intravenously day 1 8 21-day cycle . On day patient receives cetuximab vinorelbine , cetuximab give first . - For first cycle , first infusion cetuximab large dose two-hour period time . Beginning second treatment cetuximab , patient receive small dose one-hour period time . - For first treatment cetuximab , patient blood pressure , temperature , breathe rate heart rate ( vital sign ) take follow time point : infusion , 1/2 hour infusion , end infusion , one hour infusion . - For subsequent cetuximab treatment , vital sign take infusion one hour end infusion . The patient require remain infusion room one hour end cetuximab treatment observation . - CT scan ( ) , MRI ( ) , and/or x-ray ( ) site ( ) cancer do every six week ( every two cycle ) patient study assess extent cancer response treatment . - The duration active participation study depend patient non-small cell lung cancer respond treatment well tolerate treatment . The patient may receive six cycle treatment vinorelbine cetuximab . After six cycle patient may continue cetuximab alone long tolerating drug cancer n't progress .</detailed_description>
