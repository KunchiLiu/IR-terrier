	<detailed_description>This study specifically seek document infection Plasmodium species parasites prospective longitudinal study use blood smear polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) /Ligase Detection Reaction ( LDR ) diagnostic technique determine child becomes susceptible blood-stage malaria cohort non-immune child villages genetic polymorphism block expression Duffy ( Fy ) blood group antigen identify . The goal project prospectively study natural history Plasmodium vivax malaria malaria-endemic region Papua New Guinea among cohort child 24 month age old period two year . The primary objective study : 1 ) determine mean time first P. vivax infection , 2 ) determine incidence rate P. vivax infection . The secondary objective study : 1 ) ass impact recurrent Plasmodium infection child growth , 2 ) estimate sensitivity specificity blood smear versus PCR-based diagnostic method P. vivax infection , 3 ) evaluate effect FY genotype P. vivax malaria . Cross-sectional malaria prevalence data base blood smear diagnosis suggest risk malaria extremely low infancy population . Therefore , start study , child 12 month age young eligible study , new birth occur next 15 month add cohort ensure last newborn minimum 9 month follow-up . All child enrol study follow weekly detect clinical malaria biweekly blood sample take detection asymptomatic malaria .
