	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine cause people become sick , others , infect parasite Schistosoma haematobium , also know Bilharzia . This infection urinary tract blood vessel cause serious disease . Approximately 4400 adult child age participate study . They must resident Msambweni Area , Kwale District , Coast Province , Kenya , infection S. haematobium parasites common . To find people infect , first provide 1 urine sample microscope examination detect S. haematobium parasites present body . Volunteers examine ultrasound see kidney bladder disease . ( Ultrasound examination use non-painful machine use sound wave examine condition internal organ . ) Treatment drug praziquantel offer S. haematobium infection find .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal project focus field laboratory research specific epidemiological , genetic immunological feature underline great susceptibility S. haematobium infection disease . This information , combine epidemiological model control strategy , allow accelerate synthesis next generation control program . The study initial Protocol A involve large-scale survey study village determine current population demography , general health , infection S. haematobium , , specifically , prevalence parasite-related morbidity . Once evaluate , participant Protocol A may subsequently enrol Project Protocols B F meet inclusion criterion . The size observational Protocol A study cohort ( ~4,400 ) , part , base one secondary aim : i.e. , need identify sufficient number morbidity-concordant sibling pair genetic study perform Protocol D , sufficient mother-infant pair Protocol F. Beyond initial screening , investigation occur Protocol A per se . Standard dose praziquantel therapy give treat S. haematobium infection diagnose Protocol A. Longitudinal follow-up subset treat individual perform Protocols B , C E project . The study enroll approximately 1100 adult 1100 child 2 type rural S. haematobium-endemic village : ) prior participation schistosomiasis control program ( 1984-1993 ) b ) . The Msambweni area Kwale District southern Coast Province , Kenya serve 'previously-treated ' area . This area participate long-term study S. haematobium treatment since 1983 . Three additional area village ( population ~4,000 ) previously participate treatment program include control 'previously-untreated ' area comparison purpose confirm natural history untreated infection . Like Msambweni area village , comparison village ( Mbuani , Mabakoni , Gonjora ) locate southern Kwale District , Coast Province , Kenya . In order mirror pre-control experience Msambweni village , comparison village select primarily high S. haematobium prevalence ( &gt; 40 % ) determine prior Ministry Health sample survey school . Secondary selection criterion village size ( 1200 2000 per village ) rural , mostly agrarian environment . Residents update demography kinship data , receive physical examination , urinalysis , ultrasound parasitological examination determine infection morbidity status . Because size , population survey systematic , village-by village basis first 2 year project . These survey provide effective cross-sectional evaluation current level disease treat untreated community at-large . Subjects suspicion severe renal dysfunction bladder cancer ( know late complication S. haematobium ) refer Msambweni Mombasa Hospitals care . The primary study objective compare rate moderate-to-severe urinary tract morbidity associate S. haematobium infection old child adult reside previously-treated previously-untreated village endemic southern Kwale District , Coast Province , Kenya . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) compare rate heavy S. haematobium infection individual reside previously-treated -untreated village ; ( 2 ) identify eligible subject participation detail study late S. haematobium-related disease , hereditary predisposition morbidity , association cytokine response morbidity , effect utero sensitization S. haematobium disease later life ( Protocols B-F project ) .</detailed_description>

Pregnant woman participate parasitological screen phase study . However , pregnancyrelated effect urinary system , ultrasound examination exclude analysis hydronephrosis . Further , potential toxicity praziquantel ( Category B ) alternative , metrifonate ( anticholinesterase ) , postprotocol antiparasitic therapy delay mother delivers stop breastfeed infant .</criteria>
