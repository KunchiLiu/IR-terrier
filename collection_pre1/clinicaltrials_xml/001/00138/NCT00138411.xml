	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety pharmacokinetics ( long drug stay bloodstream high level drug different time ) ETI-204 follow intravenous ( IV-into vein ) injection , evaluate effect ETI-204 may pharmacokinetics oral ( mouth ) ciprofloxacin , antibiotic approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . ETI-204 experimental drug ( approved FDA ) intend protect anthrax ( bacterial infection ) . Approximately 36 male female healthy volunteer age 18 50 study . Participation study may last eight week . Volunteers single IV dose ETI-204 study drug placebo ( inactive substance , participant also receive ciprofloxacin . They stay Clinical Pharmacology Unit least 36 hour dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This initial study ETI-204 examine safety pharmacokinetics ETI-204 follow IV administration absence presence ciprofloxacin . The pharmacokinetics ciprofloxacin presence ETI-204 also determine . This study placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomize study conduct single site . Healthy male female volunteer recruit Columbus , OH area , maximum participation period 7 month subject ( enrollment end follow-up period ) . The study population roughly parallel ethnicity geographic area . Because first time ETI-204 study man , individual age 18 permit participate study . Part 1 randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind study conduct single study site . Part 2 double-blind respect ETI-204 blind oral ciprofloxacin . Part 1 study dose escalation portion , safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics single IV dose ETI-204 evaluate . Three dose level propose study : 18 mg , 54 mg , 108 mg. At dose level , 3 male 3 female randomly assign active drug 1 male 1 female randomly assign placebo . Thus , least 24 subject study Part 1 . Part 2 study determine safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics single IV dose ( 108 mg dose part 1 , presume safety tolerability issue ) , whether effect ETI-204 ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics . There 2 group 6 subject . The first cohort receive ETI-204 plus ciprofloxacin second receive ETI-204 placebo plus ciprofloxacin . Together comparable group part 1 , allow determination effect ciprofloxacin ETI-204 pharmacokinetics ETI-204 ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics . Subjects receive ciprofloxacin 500 mg placebo every 12 hour total 14 day begin time ETI-204/placebo administration . It anticipate number subject part 1 study ( 18 receive active ETI-204 6 receive placebo ) sufficient allow preliminary assessment safety efficacy ( ETI-204 concentration ) . In part 2 , 12 subject receive active ETI-204 ( 108 mg dose part 1 , presume safety tolerability issue ) . Of , 6 also receive oral ciprofloxacin 6 serve control ( i.e. , ETI-204 alone ) . An additional cohort 6 subject receive ETI-204 placebo oral ciprofloxacin . This number subject sufficient provide indication presence drug-drug interaction ETI-204 ciprofloxacin , necessarily magnitude . All statistical comparison perform use two sided test alpha level 0.05 unless specifically state otherwise . All statistical null hypothesis assert difference treatment . Because first study man ETI-204 , full risk determine . ETI-204 tested utility prevent life-threatening sequela may occur follow exposure anthrax . The result study could demonstrate ETI-204 acceptable safety profile pharmacokinetic profile provide serum concentration drug ( antibody ) time effective prevent toxicity one exotoxins produce B. anthracis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Healthy male female subject age 1850 inclusive time enrollment . In drug cohort ( subgroup ) , least two subject must female . 2 . The follow screening laboratory parameter must within normal range : AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase , hemoglobin , serum creatinine . No repeat test allow analytes . For clinical chemistry analyte CBC ( include differential platelet count ) parameter outside normal range , PI sponsor 's medical monitor confer must agree write value clinical significance subject allow enter study . 3 . The value follow test screen : G6P dehydrogenase normal HBsAG negative HBV negative AntiHCV negative AntiHIV ( HIV antibody test ) negative Urine drug screen ( include cotinine ) negative 4 . Female subject childbearing potential must agree practice abstinence use license , effective form birth control ( e.g. , oral contraceptive , diaphragm condom combination contraceptive jelly , cream foam , intrauterine contraceptive device , DepoProveraÂ® , skin patch , vaginal ring , cervical cap ) least 30 day prior enrollment duration study , include followup period . Females use hormonal contraceptive must agree use least one method least 30 day prior enrollment duration study , include followup period . 5 . Female subject must negative pregnancy test . 6 . No history hospitalization illness within six month prior study enrollment . 7 . Nonsmoker exsmoker . If subject exsmoker , he/she must use nicotine least 6 month prior enrollment . This confirm negative urine test cotinine . 8 . Able spend two day specify study schedule confine facility study rule . 9 . Able read , understand sign Informed Consent form . 1 .

Medical condition Investigator 's opinion could adversely impact subject 's participation , safety conduct study . 6 . Subject take investigational medication previous three month . 7 . The subject history drug alcohol abuse within past two year . 8 . The subject female plan become pregnant study 42 day followup period . 9 . Calculated Body Mass Index ( BMI ) great 35 less 18.5 . 10 . The subject previously vaccinate anthrax participate clinical research involve anthrax . 11 . Any EKG abnormality except follow : 1 . Sinus bradycardia younger , athletic subject 2 . Mild first degree AV block ( PR interval &lt; 0.23 sec ) 3 . Mild right left axis deviation 4 . Incomplete right bundle branch block DMID allow exception eligibility criteria waiver enrollment .</criteria>
