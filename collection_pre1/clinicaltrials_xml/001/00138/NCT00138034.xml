	<brief_summary>Reocclusion infarct artery observe 30 % patient within three month successful thrombolysis acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Reocclusion associate increase risk death , reinfarction need revascularization . Even absence clinical reinfarction , reocclusion result impair left ventricular ( LV ) recovery , leave patient increase risk develop heart failure long-term . Prevention reocclusion therefore warrant . In previous trial , severity infarct relate stenosis independent predictor reocclusion . With lack clinical predictor reocclusion , many cardiologist therefore empirically favor routine revascularization successful thrombolysis . The APRICOT-3 first randomize trial current era improve angioplasty technique study question whether routine invasive strategy successful thrombolysis reduce incidence reocclusion subsequently improve clinical outcome LV-function . After successful thrombolysis , patient randomize either routine invasive strategy ischemia-guided strategy . The investigator expect demonstrate low reocclusion rate 6-month follow-up angiography ( primary endpoint ) few associate event ( death , reinfarction , revascularization , admission heart failure ) routine invasive arm . In search non-invasive parameter predictive reocclusion , laboratory analysis several coagulation inflammatory marker perform . Finally , pool analysis 3 APRICOT trial focus identification clinical predictor reocclusion easily obtain history physical examination .</brief_summary>
