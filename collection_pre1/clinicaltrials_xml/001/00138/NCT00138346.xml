	<detailed_description>This 3 year study approximately 840 male female subject age 5 year old conduct Peruvian Highland community Lima , Peru order describe dynamic associated risk factor human infection Cystic Hydatid Disease ( CHD ) . The purpose determine prevalence incidence infection disease human population , assess proportion seroconversion ( positive negative ) follow-up indiviuals every year identify risk factor related human infection disease use baseline questionnaire ( e.g . husbandry practice education level ) . Echinococcal infection prevalent region world dog use care large herd ( Lima , Peru ) . This study involve collection 5 ml blood every year 3 year . In addition , CXR abdominal US also perform . Signs symptoms hydatid disease depend organ involve ( lung liver ) size cyst . At time , best therapeutic approach surgical intervention precede careful radiological evaluation plus adjuvant chemotherapy . The mortality rate post surgery 1-4 % patient refuse surgery , 60 % . Despite presence current method control , parasite prevalence appear increase worldwide therefore study obtain data implement control program eradicate zoonosis .</detailed_description>
