As salivary tissue sensitive radiation often change saliva early treatment . New product market claim alleviate symptom dry mouth help body ’ natural defense reduce harmful oral bacteria . These product contain important salivary enzyme lactoperoxidase , lysozyme , lactoferrin glucose oxidase . Biotene product therefore potential reduce microbial population result radiation caries periodontal disease addition provide relief discomfort xerostomia . Despite knowledge surround xerostomia head neck irradiation population , treatment well documented question patient comfort well address . Comparisons : This study aim compare different mouth care regimes determine effective treatment alternative radiotherapy . Patients randomise either Biotene Bicarbonate-based mouth care regime .
