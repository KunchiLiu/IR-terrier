	<brief_summary>The purpose study , investigate low intensity electromagnetic radiation , influence cognitive performance well healthy adolescent adult . Furthermore , purpose provide special information subject cause possible reaction . Finally , investigation try clarify anything specific radiation signal cause effect</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Experimental Study Mobile Base Station Related Radio-Frequency Electromagnetic Radiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EMF-exposure relate report symptoms sleep-disorders , headache , nervousness , fatigue , concentration difficulty . This study intend focus symptom related UMTS control signal . The purpose study investigate possible annoyance low intensity electromagnetic radiation , exist modern antenna mast support mobile communication . Also try get good understand specific part signal lead symptom . This investigation try clarify risk adult adolescent , susceptibility factor , whether radiation change cognitive function . The mentioned complaint related psychological distress somatization , EMF-related complaint report individual high somatization tendency . In present study , therefore propose control symptom somatization personality trait think influence perception reporting symptom . In study signal level 1 volt/meter ( 2.6 mW/m2 ) use . This level correspond level , experienced general public living rather near base station antenna . The antenna arrangement produce approximation plane wave , intensity constant ( within 2 dB ) volume occupied subject . The subject require sit close computer screen keyboard , modify distribution slightly . The climatic chamber use study modify absorb line dampen reflection wall . The chamber also modify make screened room prevent external RF field , extent low frequency field , enter chamber . Except cable keyboard screen electromagnetic radiator chamber . The four different exposure type use , Sham exposure ( radiation antenna ) , UMTS signal ( typical base station signal , 2140 MHz ) , CW ( continuous wave ) 2140 MHz . Wideband W-CDMA signal , f=2140 MHz , modulate random data sequence chip rate 3.8 MHz , correspond pure UMTS modulation signal , without control signal .</detailed_description>
