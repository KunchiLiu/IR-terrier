	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Long Versus Short Wait For Primary Total Hip Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Long wait time certain medical , diagnostic surgical procedure result high demand relatively scarce resource . Most western country establish queue elective procedure consultation . Among elective surgical procedure , total hip knee replacement long wait list , twice long waits elective cardiovascular eye surgery . The data wait list highly reliable , nevertheless clear British Columbia wait hip knee arthroplasty grow 2 month 1995 6 month 1999 similar increase take place Ontario . At Vancouver Hospital median wait procedure past year 7-8 month . Patients usually consider candidate hip knee replacement pain dysfunction become severe . But wait prolongs dysfunction pain already warrant surgery . A number study demonstrate burden suffering could relieve short wait . The question whether much prompt access surgery could benefit patient long term attract little research . A study propose first time directly address short- long-term benefit expedite surgery patient-based measure economic cost , use valid reliable method instrument result clearly understand widely accept . Objectives The primary research question : Does expedite hip knee replacement result improve lower-extremity function 36 month post randomization measure WOMAC functional dimension ? A secondary component functional question whether expedite surgery improve pain stiffness score measure WOMAC generic quality life ( QOL ) measure SF-36 HUI3 ? Secondary question : Does joint-specific generic QOL deteriorate significantly wait ? Does prolong wait increase economic cost associate hip knee arthroplasty ? And expedite surgery effect patient satisfaction major joint replacement ? Hypothesis Reducing wait time may improve patient outcomes . This biologically plausible prolong arthritic process joint may result muscle atrophy , tissue contracture deterioration general medical condition may fully recoverable post-surgery . There evidence harm concurrent wait none deleterious long-term effect hip knee replacement patient . Our hypothesis prolong wait significant independent risk factor reduce long-term benefit follow surgery . Our secondary hypothesis prolong wait hip knee arthroplasty increase total economic cost associate treatment disorder . Research plan The plan involve randomize controlled clinical trial assign joint replacement candidate either 1-2 month wait 7-8 month wait . We ask patient wait list complete QOL economic assessment questionnaire start wait , end wait every six month 36 month post randomization . Outcome measure WOMAC , Oxford 12-Item Hip Knee score , SF-36 , HUI3 , resource utilization information drawn patient questionnaire administrative database , measure patient satisfaction . The analysis use univariate multivariate predictive model . In addition ass health trajectory relative utilization cost .</detailed_description>
