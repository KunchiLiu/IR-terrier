	<brief_title>Study OGX-011 Given Prior Radical Prostatectomy Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clusterin anti-apoptotic cytoprotective chaperone protein upregulated adaptive cell survival manner confers resistance various cell death trigger , include hormone- , radiation- , chemotherapy . In pre-clinical model , inhibition clusterin expression use second generation antisense OGX-011 enhance cell death follow treatment androgen ablation , radiotherapy , chemotherapy . In phase I clinical trial , OGX-011 well tolerate biologically effective dose identify human . Study Design This open-label , non-blinded , phase II clinical , tissue pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study weekly OGX-011 neoadjuvant hormone therapy prior radical prostatectomy patient localized prostate carcinoma high-risk feature . Study Objectives Primary Objectives - To assess effect combine neoadjuvant hormone therapy ( NHT ) OGX-011 prior radical prostatectomy pathologic complete response rate men high risk localize prostate cancer . Secondary Objectives - To quantify change clusterin expression residual prostate cancer treatment NHT OGX-011 . - To measure level full length OGX-011 prostate tissue 3 month NHT . - To assess safety tolerability toxicity 3 month OGX-011 NHT prior radical prostatectomy . - To measure evidence OGX-011 's effect clusterin expression patient peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMNC ) . - To measure evidence OGX-011 's effect patient clusterin serum level . - To assess effect combine NHT OGX-011 time PSA nadir . - To determine PSA recurrence rate combine NHT OGX-011 . Key Eligibility Criteria 1 . Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate , previously untreated 2 . Potential candidate radical prostatectomy 3 . Any one following criterion ( minimum 2 positive biopsy ) : - Clinical stage T3 - Serum PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml - Gleason score 7-10 - Gleason score 6 &gt; 3 positive biopsy 4 . ECOG performance status 0-1 5 . WBC ≥ 3.0 x 10^9/L 6 . Hemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L 7 . Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L 8 . PTT , INR , AST , ALT , creatinine , total bilirubin within normal limit Treatment Plan Approximately 45 newly diagnose , previously untreated patient clinically localize , high-risk prostate carcinoma enter trial . These patient receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy ( buserelin 9.9 mg subcutaneously x 1 injection flutamide 250 mg orally T.I.D . first 4 week ) 12 week combination OGX-011 ( 2'MOE phosphorothioate clusterin antisense oligonucleotide ) weekly 4 week cycle 3 course . For week one , cycle one , OGX-011 give Days 1 , 3 5 . OGX-011 give dose 640 mg intravenous infusion 2 hour . Radical prostatectomy take place within 14 day last dose OGX-011 .</detailed_description>
