	<brief_title>Effectiveness Computer Application Improving Pulmonary Artery Catheter Waveform Interpretation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC ) guide diagnosis treatment intensive care unit ( ICU ) , study show physician nurse collectively inadequate skill interpret PAC waveform . We develop Web-based application provide physician nurse rapid access relevant PAC-related content use patient care situation . The application begin visual index assist clinicians recognition normal abnormal waveform provide waveform-specific link concise advice make accurate pressure measurement , troubleshoot system problem , avoid complication catheter use . Initial evaluation consist before-and-after trial determine whether application improve test performance area waveform recognition , accuracy measurement , appropriateness action . Once resource production , electronically log usage survey user evaluate extent effect actual utilization .</detailed_description>
