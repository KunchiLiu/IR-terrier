	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate efficacy safety Zevalin-BEAM preparative regimen autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) measure event free survival ( EFS ) . The goal obtain 15 % increase EFS 2 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Yttrium-90 Ibritumomab Tiuxetan ( Zevalin ) With BEAM Relapsed Low Grade B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The indolent course low-grade B-cell lymphoma thus characterize multiple remission relapse ever-shortening “ time progression ” interval , ultimately become refractory treatment . In situation recurrence , intensive therapy include high-dose chemotherapy chemo-radiotherapy follow autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation appear therapeutic option . With use peripheral blood stem cell , autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) procedure become easier cheap , mortality rate 5 % manageable morbidity . EBMT registry data institution drive study show improvement event free survival compare chemotherapy relapse patient . Recently Schouten et al report randomized study significant benefit survival patient submit relapse ASCT . Consolidation ASCT study first line treatment show significant improvement survival one randomize study . BEAM regimen referent high-dose chemotherapy use intensive therapy follow ASCT treatment malignant lymphoma . It could therefore consider patient indolent lymphoma could show improve survival . In study condition regimen associate chemotherapy Total Body Irradiation ( TBI ) indolent lymphoma sensitive even low dose radiotherapy . TBI however time consume technically available transplant center associate long term toxicity ; search specific target irradiation goal several year . Recently , new preparative regimen old patient aggressive CD20-positive B-cell lymphoma utilize standard-dose 0.4 mCi/kg 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan combine high-dose BEAM follow ASCT show CR rate 92 % follow-up 9 month . Finally , high-dose radioimmunotherapy 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan high-dose cyclophosphamide/etoposide follow ASCT poor-risk relapse B-cell NHL report , 2-year DFS 80 % . The use conventional dose Yttrium need heavy radioprotection procedure , widely distribute transplant center . Overall toxicity comparable standard autologous transplantation conditioning regimen , combine treatment well tolerate . The hematological reconstitution transplantation occur without delay , except two case control-based high-dose chemotherapy alone population . Mucositis neutropenic fever report without increase severity . Nonhematological adverse event observe , three interstitial pneumonitis , mild abnormality liver kidney function test , except one case veno-occlusive disease , 4 fatal infection ( disseminated aspergillosis brain abscess , streptococcal sepsis , staphylococcal sepsis , disseminate varicella zoster ) . Therefore , data support phase II trial evaluate efficacy toxicity patient low grade B-Cell lymphoma new preparative regimen combine standard dose 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan high-dose BEAM chemotherapy follow ASCT .</detailed_description>
