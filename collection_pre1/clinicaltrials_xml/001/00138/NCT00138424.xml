	<brief_summary>This study look safety , tolerability effectiveness cidofovir kidney transplant patient diagnose BK virus nephropathy ( BKVN ) , viral condition cause patient reject transplant kidney . Up 48 adult ( age 18 year old ) kidney pancreas transplant recipient newly diagnose BKVN receive 1 3 cidofovir dose level placebo ( non medicate substance ) identify maximum tolerate dose . Dosing administer intravenously ( tube run blood vessel ) . In addition screen visit , volunteer actively participate approximately 8-10 week single follow phone call 4 month . Blood sample , urine sample , eye exam physical exam include study procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-escalation study evaluate safety tolerability 3 dose level cidofovir administer renal transplant recipient BK virus nephropathy identify maximum tolerated dos ( MTD ) among 3 dose level cidofovir renal transplant recipient BK virus nephropathy . The secondary study objective evaluate antiviral effect cidofovir 3 dose level ; evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) cidofovir renal transplant recipient underlie renal impairment ; evaluate pharmacodynamics ( PD ) cidofovir set ; evaluate allograft function completion study ; ass allograft rejection completion study . Patients BKVN ( virus nephropathy ) diagnose positive plasma polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) renal allograft biopsy randomize receive study drug within 60 day date renal biopsy plasma PCR assay establish diagnosis BKVN . The study consist three dose cohort ( 0.25 mg/kg , 0.5 mg/kg 1.0 mg/kg ) ; cohort consist approximately 12 subject randomize 2:1 receive either cidofovir placebo ( 0.9 % normal saline ) define MTD among three specified dos cidofovir . Once MTD establish , approximately 12 additional patient enrol dose . The MTD define dose 2 8 cidofovir treated subject experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . The target enrollment 48 subject dose cohort fully enrol . A 25 % over-enrollment may tolerate allow continued enrollment subject low dose cohort data concomitant review Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) replace non-evaluable study participant . Study participant randomize receive cidofovir/placebo ( cohort ) consider non-evaluable discontinue study die reason except toxicity definitely relate study treatment , include DLTs . These subject may replace . There 5-week drug administration period ( 4 dos ) follow 2 week end-of-study observation evaluation period cohort . At 3 month last dose study infusion , member research staff ass study participant counsel pregnancy status via phone call . The study overseen DSMB review data dose cohort complete . The primary endpoint study assess safety tolerability cidofovir kidney transplant recipient assess enumeration adverse event ( AEs ) report subject and/or investigator , change observe physical examination ( include vital sign ) laboratory evaluation drug administration end-of-treatment observation evaluation period . The severity relationship AEs receipt study drug determine primary endpoint focus safety . The secondary endpoint effect cidofovir BK virus determine : percentage subject achieve undetectable BK virus urine plasma PCR baseline end treatment ; rate reduction urine plasma BK virus load quantitative PCR baseline end treatment ; time reduction BK virus urine plasma PCR ; detail PK cidofovir evaluate subject MTD ; PD cidofovir assess quantitating change BK virus deoxyribonucleic aci</detailed_description>
