	<brief_summary>West Nile Virus cause infection spread human bite certain type mosquito . Mosquitoes become infect bite infected bird . The purpose study find West Nile Virus , may assist design good treatment . The study look effect disease individual , specifically nervous system , outcomes disease . Study participant include 120 adult age 18 older , either fever and/or change neurological ( involve brain nervous system ) status due document West Nile Virus infection . Study procedure include physical examination , blood test , urine test , cerebral spinal fluid ( fluid around brain spinal cord ) test , neurological ( nervous system ) test . Study participant follow 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>West Nile Virus Natural History</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , prospective , natural history study design characterize West Nile Virus ( WNV ) disease , include functional neurologic outcome , study participant laboratory document WNV infection symptom consistent WNV neuroinvasive disease WNV fever . The objective study : identify describe mortality morbidity , specifically neurologic functional outcome patient WNV ; characterize clinical course diverse manifestation WNV disease ; ass kinetics humoral immune response WNV infection , correlate response clinical outcome . The study enroll propose sample size 120 study participant age 18 older . All study participant undergo series laboratory , neurologic , physical examination follow prospectively one year characterize spectrum sequela WNV disease . When patient meet inclusion criterion , inform consent obtain , blood collect perform polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , immunoglobulin ( Ig ) M , IgG test WNV infection . Urine PCR WNV also obtain . Upon enrollment ( Day 1 ) , medical surgical history , review system , travel , vector blood product history obtain , baseline neurologic clinical status evaluate . A clinical assessment , include physical examination , vital sign laboratory assessment perform . Based history pre-illness neurologic functional score estimate , use Barthel Index ( BI ) Modified Rankin Scale ( MRS ) . Investigators assess Day 1 functional score , use BI , Modified Mini-Mental Status Examination ( 3MS ) , Glasgow Outcome Score ( GOS ) , Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) hospitalize recorded answer question abstract MRS day entry study . At study visit Day 1 ± 3 , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) obtain test cell count , differential , protein glucose , IgM , IgG PCR WNV infection . If study participant lumbar puncture conduct standard care time 72 hour prior 72 hour study enrollment , repeat lumbar puncture necessary adequate aliquot CSF available shipment Collaborative Antiviral Study Group ( CASG ) Virology Laboratory require cell count , differential , protein glucose test perform . A brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan do study visit Day 1 ± 3 . If brain MRI scan study visit Day 1 ± 3 suggest abnormality , repeat MRI scan conduct study visit Day 30 ± 5 . If change ( either improvement worsen ) WNV related lesion occur since MRI conduct study visit Day 1 ± 3 , third MRI conduct study visit Day 90 ± 14 . Subsequent MRIs conduct study visit 180 ± 21 365 ± 30 WNV related lesion continue improve worsen : two MRIs WNV related lesion remain stable obviate need MRI scan . There study visit Day 1 , Day 14 ± 3 , Day 30 ± 5 , Day 90 ± 14 , Day 180 ± 21 , Day 365 ± 30 . At visit brief physical examination do , functional score assign , blood obtain serologic WNV study . Neurological endpoint include GCS 4 validate functional cognitive scoring scale : The BI , MRS , GOS , 3MS . MRI spinal cord , electromyogram nerve conduction study include available .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients , regardless race gender , consent meet entry criterion , enrol . Greater equal 18 year age Documented West Nile Virus ( WNV ) infection ( fever neuroinvasive disease ) begin within four month prior study entry . Illness onset define first visit medical care provider compatible symptom ( see cohort A B ) document . Local laboratory documentation WNV infection define positive immunoglobulin ( Ig ) M and/or polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) WNV serum cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) concurrent follow illness onset . Qualification A B Cohort . Cohort A : Neuroinvasive Disease Cohort : Fever ( temperature great 38 degree Celsius ) document health care provider . AND : least one following , document health care provider absence likely clinical explanation : 1 . Acutely alter mental status ( e.g. , disorientation , obtundation , stupor , coma ) , 2 . Other acute sign central peripheral neurologic dysfunction ( e.g. , paresis paralysis , nerve palsy , sensory deficit , abnormal reflex , generalized convulsion , abnormal movement ) , 3 . CSF pleocytosis ( white blood cell count great equal 4 per mm^3 correct red blood cell contamination CSF ) associate illness clinically compatible meningitis ( e.g. , headache stiff neck ) . Cohort B : West Nile Virus Fever Cohort : Temperature great 38 degree Celsius document health care provider . Unable obtain valid informed consent . Alternate explanation ( determined investigator ) clinical finding ( structural brain lesion , cerebrovascular accident , infectious disease ) . Evidence microbial organism demonstrable gram fungal stain cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) within four month prior study entry . Investigator 's opinion patient would unable adhere protocol requirement .</criteria>
