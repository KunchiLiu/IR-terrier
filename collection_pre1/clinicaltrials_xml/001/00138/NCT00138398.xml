	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine immune system change age make influenza serious illness old people . Influenza vaccination protect people get flu also lessen severity illness . This particularly true people congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . This research may provide information could eventually lead new laboratory test predict effective vaccination prevent influenza illness old people . Volunteer participant study include follow group : 1 ) healthy young adult 20 - 40 year old ; 2 ) old adult , 60 year old , without history CHF ; 3 ) old adult , 60 year old , history CHF . All study participant vaccinate current preparation inactivate influenza vaccine . A small amount blood drawn vaccine 4 , 10 , 16-20 week afterward .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study increase understanding age , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) prior hospitalization influenza-related acute coronary event affect immune response influenza vaccination . By elucidate defect immune response influenza vaccination associate subsequent influenza illness , method use screen subset older adult establish risk profile relate influenza population , target defect future vaccine development use method surrogates protection screen potential vaccine prior conduct large scale clinical trial establish clinical efficacy . The primary objective show granzyme B ( Grz B ) level influenza virus-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture low old adult receive inactivated influenza vaccine ( IIV ) subsequently develop influenza illness compare . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) establish cut-off value Grz B marker increase risk influenza illness ; ( 2 ) show interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) level low interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) level higher influenza virus-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture vaccinate old adult subsequently develop influenza illness compare ; ( 3 ) determine effect macrophage migration inhibitory facator ( MIF ) T-cell response influenza vaccination ; ( 4 ) determine association CHF ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) include acute coronary syndrome immune response influenza vaccination ; ( 5 ) determine effect functional status measure Six-Minute Walk Test ( SMWT ) immune responsiveness influenza vaccination ; ( 6 ) determine effect medication anti-inflammatory effect include angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) cholesterol-lowering drug ( statin ) immune responsiveness influenza vaccination ; ( 7 ) evaluate effect age-related decline expression costimulatory molecule , CD28 , cytotoxic T-lymphocytes , Grz B response influenza vaccination ; ( 8 ) study potential role activation-induced cell death ( AICD ) T helper type 1 ( Th1 : IFN-gamma ) versus T helper type 2 ( Th2 : IL-10 ) response influenza vaccination ; ( 9 ) determine vitro whether co-stimulatory molecule 4-1BB ligand CD70 use augment cytokine , Grz B CTL responses influenza vaccine old adult ; ( 10 ) determine vitro whether heat shock protein ( HSP ) use augment cytokine and/or Grz B response influenza vaccination old adult ; ( 11 ) determine vitro whether heat shock protein ( HSP ) use augment cytokine and/or Grz B response influenza vaccination old adult develop influenza illness spite influenza vaccination ; ( 12 ) determine vitro whether heat shock protein ( HSP ) increase frequency , Grz B content proportion influenza virus-specific CTL express CD28 vaccinate old adult . The study group consist 150 adult , age 60 year old , characterize accord age , presence CHF IHD , ( identify prior influenza season ) admission acute coronary syndrome exacerbation CHF . All subject vaccinate fall year current preparation trivalent , split-virus influenza vaccine . Serum antibody titer , serum cytokine level , ex vivo level IFN-gamma IL-10 , ex vivo vitro level Grz B influenza-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell pre-vaccination post-vaccination ( 4 , 10 16-20 week ) time point compare subject get influenza illness . The peak well duration response vaccination immunologic measure determine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Willing vaccinate current influenza vaccine . Healthy young adult 2040 year underlie chronic disease . 'Healthy ' old adult participant age 60 older may underlie chronic disease diagnosis CHF , advance kidney disease diabetes require insulin . Highrisk old adult cardiovascular disease age 60 year old diagnosis CHF , IHD include ACS previous winter season . Allergic reaction egg preservative contain contact lens solution . A previous significant reaction vaccination refuse receive influenza vaccination . Known immunosuppressive disorder medication ( include oral prednisone dose &gt; 10 mg daily ) receive influenza vaccination past . Subjects report respiratory illness within twoweek period prior vaccination . Subjects report respiratory symptom first study visit reschedule time respiratory illness ( least two symptom cough , runny nose , malaise fever ) within twoweek period prior vaccination . Cardiovascular disease due intravenous drug abuse , myocarditis congenital abnormality Any condition opinion investigator would interfere interpretation evaluation vaccine</criteria>
