	<brief_summary>This study 125 healthy male female Kenyan adult age 18 year , 300 healthy male female Kenyan infant enrol 1 month age follow 3 year age . Twenty healthy adult ( US resident ) self-reported history Malaria exposure , infection travel malaria endemic area world serve Malaria Naive Negative Controls . The propose study represent continuation molecular immunologic study do human population describe mechanisms protection malaria infection disease . Human investigation experience natural exposure malaria infection justify since eventually target population test malaria vaccine safety efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study include two major population : ( 1 ) Adult Repeat Cross Sectional study ( ARCS ) involve 125 healthy Kenya-residents male female age 18 year ; ( 2 ) Pediatric Infant Cohort ( PIC ) include 300 healthy male female infant resident Kenya . In addition , 20 healthy adult US resident , self-reported history malaria exposure , infection travel malaria endemic area world , serve Malaria Naive Negative Controls ( MNNC ) . The adult ( ARCS ) study consist 6 venous blood donation complete one year . The primary outcome ACRS determine stability Immune responses MSP-1 clinically protect P. falciparum infection secondary outcome measure level stability MSP-1 specific IIA activity , MSP-1 specific T-cell memory phenotype immune function lastly , determine MSP-1 genotype . The PIC study home clinic-based . The overall duration study three year . The subject recruit routine immunization visit . The data sample collection consist monthly home-visits intersperse clinic-visits every 6 month child reach 3 year old . The primary outcome PIC study evaluate development humoral cellular immunity MSP-1 healthy child relation history P. falciparum infection , number episode uncomplicated acute malarial infection first 3 year life secondary outcome measure acquisition MSP-1 specific IIA activity , shifts T-cell memory phenotype amalaira-specific immunity association history exposure P. falciparum MSP-1 alleleic variant . For MNNS study , primary objective optimize molecular immunologic assay use Kenya determine background level responses healthy adult secondary outcome aim measure level MSP-1 specific IIA-activity , T-cell memory phenotype non-specific immunity malaria antigens provide negative control DNA P. falciparum detection genotyping study . The result study provide insight frequency intensity prior malaria infection antigenic polymorphism influence generation maintenance T-cell memory AB responses merozoite surface protein human .</detailed_description>
