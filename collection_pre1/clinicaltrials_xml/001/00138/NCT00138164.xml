	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , denileukin diftitox , may able carry cancer-killing substance directly non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well denileukin diftitox work treat patient relapsed refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Denileukin Diftitox Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy denileukin diftitox , term objective response time progression , patient relapse refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Secondary - Determine safety drug patient . - Determine 1-year overall survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV 20-80 minute day 1-3 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 , 50 , 57 , 64 , 71 , 78 , 85 , 92 , 99 ( week 1-16 ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve partial response week 16 may continue treatment monthly 8 additional dos complete response ( CR ) achieve . Patients achieve CR ( time ) receive 2 additional monthly dos denileukin diftitox beyond CR . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 25-50 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
