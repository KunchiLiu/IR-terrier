	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid work treat patient stage IIIB , stage IV , recurrent non-small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid Treating Patients With Stage IIIB , Stage IV , Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response non-small cell lung cancer SAHA second line set apply RECIST criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate time progression overall survival patient population . II . To examine toxicity profile SAHA . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate molecular activity SAHA evaluate effect histone acetylation , upregulation target gene , generation reactive oxygen specie , apoptosis correlation P53 status . II . To explore gene expression profile predict response SAHA . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month every 3 month 1 year disease progression .</detailed_description>
