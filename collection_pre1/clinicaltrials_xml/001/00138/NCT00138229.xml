	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : An infusion patient 's lymphocyte treat laboratory remove certain immune cell may effective treatment melanoma . Drugs , cyclophosphamide fludarabine , may suppress immune system patient 's immune cell allow infused lymphocyte work . Interleukin-2 may help lymphocyte kill tumor cell put back body . Giving cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow autologous lymphocyte infusion interleukin-2 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow autologous lymphocyte infusion interleukin-2 work treat patient refractory recurrent melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma treat nonmyeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprise cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow autologous CD25-positive-T-regulatory-cell-depleted lymphocyte reinfusion high-dose interleukin-2 . Secondary - Determine rate repopulation CD25-positive T-regulatory cell patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : - Apheresis CD25-positive T-regulatory cell depletion : Patients undergo 1-2 aphereses collect peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . CD25-positive T-regulatory cell deplete collected PBMC vitro . - Nonmyeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day -8 -7 fludarabine IV 15-30 minute day -6 -2 . - Autologous CD25-positive-T-regulatory-cell-depleted lymphocyte reinfusion : Patients receive autologous lymphocyte IV 20-30 minute day 0 . - Filgrastim ( G-CSF ) high-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) therapy : Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously ( SC ) daily begin day 0 continue blood count recover . Patients also receive high-dose IL-2 IV 15 minute 3 time daily day 0-4 14-18 . Patients reevaluate 4-6 week completion high-dose IL-2 therapy . Patients achieve stable disease partial response may receive additional high-dose IL-2 2 retreatment course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Retreatment begin least 6 week autologous lymphocyte reinfusion . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week every 1-2 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 16-29 patient accrue study within 1-1.5 year .</detailed_description>
