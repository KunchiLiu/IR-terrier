	<detailed_description>Mannan Binding Lectin ( MBL ) member lectin pathway complement system play important role innate immune system . MBL replacement MBL-deficient child chemotherapy-induced neutropenia represent new approach low risk febrile episode , hospital admission , prolong use intravenous antibiotic severe infection . The aim Phase II study find evidence correct prediction plasma level MBL necessary clinical effect biological efficacy , confirm dosage regimen need reach require MBL plasma level , reconfirm safety lack side-effects .</detailed_description>
