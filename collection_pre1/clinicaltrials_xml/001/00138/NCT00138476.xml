	<brief_summary>The main objective study see number volunteer get sick Norwalk virus ( NV ) inoculation typical symptom nausea , vomit , diarrhea . If NV preparation show cause Norwalk illness , use test new vaccine future . Additionally , researcher hope determine low dose NV inoculum give volunteer cause illness . Study participant include 57 healthy adult , age 18-50 . Participants either give NV inoculum placebo ( water without virus ) . Participants hospitalize maximum 7 day minimum 4 day follow NV challenge . Study procedure include physical exam , blood testing , collection saliva , urine , stool sample . Participants involve study related procedure 180 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Challenge Pool Norwalk Virus Inoculum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Noroviruses cause acute , epidemic , non-bacterial gastroenteritis ( 24-hour intestinal flu ) Norwalk virus ( NV ) prototype strain group virus . Although NV identify 30 year ago , progress understand molecular characteristic slow due inability grow virus cell culture lack animal model . As , work must perform human volunteer . The principal source virus research stool sample obtain human volunteer experimentally infect NV ( NIH-8fIIa ) obtain National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . The quantity NV sufficient characterize entire genome significant advance make . The original NV challenge pool , obtain NIAID/NIH , longer available . Using stored stool specimen obtain otherwise healthy subject infect approximately 14 year ago NV ( NIH-8fIIa ) , new pool ( filtrate ) produce . This study design support IND application , NV challenge pool Lot 42399 , submit DMID/NIAID/NIH . The safety infectivity new NV challenge pool establish protocol . The clinical attack rate Lot 42399 determine . Initially , 20 subject challenge dose NV ( Lot 42399 ) approximates dose use previous challenge study . The predicted rate infection study , define fecal viral shed seroresponse , least 90 % receive inoculation . Approximately two-thirds infected subject expect become symptomatic . Subsequently , small group subject challenge low dosage determine Human Infectious Dose 50 percent ( HID50 ) . The overall objective study develop challenge pool/inoculum NV . The specific objective clinical study : determine safety acute toxicity new NV challenge pool ; determine NV clinical attack rate ; determine infection rate HID50 NV Lot 42399 ; measure specific immunoglobulin response NV Lot 42399 inoculation/infection blood , saliva intestinal excretion ; examine peripheral blood mononuclear cell presence NV . Study participant include 57 healthy adult , age 18-50 . This double-blind study consist informed consent , screen enrollment period , NV challenge ( inpatient NV inoculation phase ) , post challenge follow-up period . Many subject participate study expect become ill typical symptom sign viral gastroenteritis . Subjects hospitalize , maximum 7 day minimum 4 day . Participants involve study related procedure 180 day .</detailed_description>
