	<brief_summary>Citrulline amino acid produce intestine liver , liver contribute significantly circulate citrulline concentration . The intestine thus organ normally release significant amount citrulline blood . The investigator design study look value measure plasma citrulline concentration patient Crohn ’ disease short bowel normal intestinal length . Measuring plasma citrulline concentration short bowel patient may help distinguish patient need permanent parenteral feeding patient transient intestinal dysfunction . It may also help investigator understand small bowel intestinal length remain absorptive integrity . In patient normal intestinal length Crohn ’ disease , may reliable marker small bowel damage could apply establish therapeutic improvement . It demonstrate strongly correlate ( inversely ) severity intestinal biopsy . The investigator hypothesise plasma citrulline concentration marker small bowel absorptive integrity appropriate surrogate functional length small intestine . Controlled data yet exist establish place plasma citrulline assessment small bowel function man .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preliminary study report plasma citrulline concentration may reliable biochemical marker intestinal dysfunction absorptive enterocyte mass . The relationship citrulline concentration intestinal function support study include examine rejection small bowel allograft . Concentrations citrulline dramatically reduce case mucosal damage ( e.g . moderate graft rejection viral enteritis ) strongly correlate ( inversely ) severity biopsy . Plasma citrulline concentration lower also patient villous atrophy ( 24±13 μmol/L ) healthy subject ( 40±10 μmol/L ) patient anorexia nervosa ( 39±9 ) . A citrulline threshold 20 µmol/L apparently permit classification short bowel syndrome patient either transient permanent intestinal failure category , 92 % sensitivity , 90 % specificity , 95 % positive 86 % negative predictive value , respectively . Experimental study carry also assess value citrulline marker severity small bowel epithelial damage radiation . The plasma citrulline show simple , non-invasive sensitive assay monitor quantify radiation-induced small bowel damage mouse human . Otherwise , literature citrulline potential marker intestinal nutritional integrity young data specific condition come single centre ; limit data normal range . More crucially , however , attempt clarify effect inflammation citrulline homeostasis . To date information respect patient intestinal failure resection . We hypothesise plasma citrulline concentration reflect small bowel absorptive capacity correlate functional intestinal length independently inflammation . Comparisons : To exclude possibility citrulline merely reflect inflammation , control group ( six subject ) short bowel syndrome without inflammation ( mesenteric infarct ) ( negative control ) ; inflammation anatomical loss ( active coeliac disease ) ( positive control ) ; study well healthy volunteer . The study design utilise patient positive negative control group permit correlation plasma citrulline intestinal length “ gold standard ” assessment intestinal function judge patient need nutritional intervention ( normal diet dependence home parenteral nutrition ) . Plasma citrulline determine Reverse-phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography ( RF-HPLC ) overnight fast . Albumin Routine biochemical assessment also perform . Gastrointestinal permeability determine double sugar test use rhamnose lactulose , functional absorptive capacity estimate D-Xylose absorption rate . Analysis allow pair comparison patient group . Differences clinical performance various parameter determine . The study adequate statistical power .</detailed_description>
