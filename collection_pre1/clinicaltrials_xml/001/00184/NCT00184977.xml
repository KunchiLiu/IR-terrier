	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) disorder characterise symptom abnormal test expiratory flow change markedly period several month observation . COPD include chronic bronchitis emphysema . It fully clear medication efficacious long-term treatment COPD . In contrast asthma , efficacy therefore precise role inhale corticosteroid less clear treatment patient COPD . The applies another ( much less investigated ) possibility treatment COPD , anti-oxidant agent N-acetylcysteine . N-acetylcysteine use mucolytic agent variety clinical condition , acute chronic bronchitis cystic fibrosis . The aim study , perform family practice , determine 3-year treatment effect cost-effectiveness oral N-acetylcysteine versus inhale corticosteroid ( fluticason propionate ) modify course progression COPD . Comparisons : N-acetylcysteine ( oral , 600 mg o.d . ) fluticason propionate ( dry powder inhalation , 500 mcg b.i.d . ) compare placebo</detailed_description>
