	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin Injection Neck Muscles Cervicogenic Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervicogenic headache unilateral headache stem neck . Usually , pathological finding x-ray MRI neck . It suppose pain may stem various structure upper part cervical spine . Regardless source , often believe neck muscle may involve pain generation , either primarily secondarily . Treatment cervicogenic headache often difficult . The effect drug usually limit . Various surgical technique radiofrequency generation facet joint neck try , little success ( 4 ) . Botulinum toxin injection muscle several year use condition pathologically increase muscle activity , spasticity dystonias . Gradually , also use many pain condition , among headache . One case history ( 5 ) randomize placebo control , double-blind study ( 6 ) , show effect cervicogenic headache . The latter study methodological weakness , since small , 26 patient , placebo group prior treatment half much pain group receive botulinum toxin treatment . In addition , pain register daily , ( prior ) treatment 3 4 week . A review consider documentation treatment botulinum toxin idiopathic cervicogenic headache inconclusive ( 7 ) . In Department , try treatment patient typical cervicogenic headache excellent effect without side-effects . Therefore , would considerable interest perform large study good scientific quality higher statistical power above-mentioned one . As basis study would adopt conservative hypothesis ( H0 ) : Botox injection cervical muscle superior placebo alleviate pain unilateral cervicogenic headache .</detailed_description>
