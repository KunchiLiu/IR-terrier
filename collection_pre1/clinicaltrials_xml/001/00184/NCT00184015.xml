	<brief_summary>This research study subject cancer kidney ( also know renal cell carcinoma ) treat surgery . The purpose study see combination bevacizumab bortezomib safe tolerable help people kidney cancer . The investigator would also like find dose study drug use safely effectively , whether combination two drug decrease cancer symptom stop tumor growth , frequently serious side effect might occur combination . The study conduct two phasesâ€”Phase 1 Phase 2 . In Phase 1 , subject assign fix dose bevacizumab different strength bortezomib give 2 different schedule . Phase 2 depend subject tolerate dos schedule bortezomib Phase 1 . Bortezomib type drug know `` proteasome inhibitor . '' By block `` proteasome '' cancer cell , bortezomib affect way cell divide . Bevacizumab inhibitor ( blocker ) blood vessel formation . Tumors need blood vessel order continue grow bevacizumab think work prevent new blood vessel grow . Bortezomib ( also call Velcade PS-341 ) approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment myeloma , approve treatment kidney cancer . Bevacizumab ( also call Avastin ) approve FDA treatment colon cancer , approve treatment kidney cancer . However , FDA permit combine use bortezomib bevacizumab research study . The bevacizumab give study commercially market product . Although expect similar safety activity commercially available drug , possible difference may exist . Because commercially market drug , bevacizumab administer subject enrol study may administer direction physician investigator study . Approximately 40-52 subject take part study .</brief_summary>
