	<brief_summary>This study patient recently diagnose blood cancer , call acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . The standard treatment disease consist many chemotherapy drug give different combination several step . Each step treatment call cycle . Patients treat chemotherapy drug routinely use ALL give multiple treatment cycle several month . All chemotherapy drug use study approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . One drug , typically give patient ALL , call Asparaginase . It give together drug throughout different cycle treatment . This drug derive several source . The standard source call E. coli Asparaginase , associate risk allergic reaction . This drug stay body short period time ; therefore , injected daily 9-14 day cycle treatment . In study , different form Asparaginase use , call PEG-Asparaginase ( also call Oncospar ) , remain body two week , therefore , give cycle treatment still maintain high blood level drug . PEG-Asparaginase recently approve FDA treat ALL . Most experience drug child ALL . In child find safe standard form Asparaginase le allergic reaction . It also find effectiveness ALL . The experience drug adult limit . The purpose study find side effect occur adult PEG-Asparaginase give chemotherapy drug see effect response treatment ALL . Another purpose find allergic reaction reduce PEG-Asparaginase . In child early information PEG-Asparaginase produce few antibody E.coli Asparaginase . Therefore , another purpose study see many adult patient receive PEG-Asparaginase develop antibody drug .</brief_summary>
