	<brief_summary>This study melanoma vaccine . Study participant melanoma invade deeply spread lymph nod another location . Although participant ' melanoma remove , great 1 2 chance return . There approximately 40 subject study . The patient already take part melanoma vaccine study , current study , continue receive booster injection similar vaccine give two additional year . This study test experimental vaccine . The vaccine contain peptides fragment substance make melanoma . The substance tyrosinase , gpl00 melanoma antigen recognize T cell ( MART-1 ) . The vaccine also include assistant call Montanide ISA 51 . The assistant stimulate immune system . This study also test effect second assistant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) . All participant receive vaccine assistant Montanide ISA 51 , half receive assistant GM-CSF . The patient one two chance receiving assistant call GM-CSF . The main purpose study find booster injection increase body 's immunity melanoma prevent level immunity get low time . The investigator also wish know GM-CSF increase body 's immunity melanoma give melanoma vaccine . The vaccine assistant Montanide ISA 51 approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The assistant GM-CSF approve FDA increase infection-fighting white blood cell chemotherapy . It approve FDA treatment melanoma . However , FDA permit vaccine assistant test study .</brief_summary>
