	<brief_summary>This clinical research study patient acute myelogenous leukemia ( short AML ) respond previous treatment unable receive chemotherapy . Arsenic use drug many century . While arsenic contain drug use past cancer treatment , major use arsenic western country treatment uncommon tropical illness , sleep sickness . Recently , new information suggest arsenic form call arsenic trioxide may also useful treat cancer blood , leukemia , lymphoma myeloma . Studies China USA show patient type blood cancer call acute promyelocytic leukemia , whose disease fail respond treatment , respond well arsenic trioxide . Studies do laboratory United States show arsenic kill AML cell grow culture dish . Ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) , natural supplement diet , long involved cancer prevention . Laboratory test show although arsenic trioxide kill AML cell test tube , vitamin C add arsenic trioxide test tube , death leukemia cell increase significantly . The purpose study find combination arsenic trioxide ( Trisenox ) ascorbic acid effective treatment patient AML . The second purpose study two drug affect cell laboratory . Samples blood bone marrow ( part body make blood cell ) collect , specific time treatment , order study laboratory . By study blood marrow cell , researcher hope learn mechanism drug work .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis nonAPL AML ( FAB subtypes M0 M7 exclude M3 ) confirm myeloperoxidase stain and/or flow cytometry . For patient age 18 old refractory relapse AML include . Refractory disease define newly diagnose patient fulfill ONE follow criterion : Patient age 60 year young , fail achieve complete remission least two cycle front line induction chemotherapy . Patients age AML , post myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , fail achieve complete remission least one cycle front line induction chemotherapy . Patients age 60 year old fail achieve complete remission least one cycle front line induction chemotherapy . Newly diagnose patient age 55 old receive intensive antileukemia chemotherapy also enrol . Postmyelodysplasia AML secondary AML include . Stem cell transplantation failure include . Karnofsky performance status great equal 50 % . Adequate renal function ( creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min ) hepatic function ( transaminases &lt; 2.5 x ULN , serum total bilirubin &lt; 3 mg/dl ) . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior enrollment study , woman men must use effective birth control method study . Signed consent . Newly diagnose patient old age 55 : Refuse chemotherapy treat physician recommends standard antileukemia induction chemotherapy . Have Karnofsky performance status great equal 70 % , age &lt; 75 year prior myelodysplastic syndrome . Have risk/benefit ratio give treat physician good reason administration standard antileukemia induction chemotherapy . Patients already treat arsenic . CML blastic crisis . Patients cardiopathy include recurrent supraventricular arrhythmia type sustain ventricular arrhythmia conduction block ( AV block grade II III , LBBB ) . Patients HIV . Pregnant breastfeed woman . QT interval &gt; 460 msec presence serum potassium &gt; 4.0 mEq/L magnesium &gt; 1.8 mg/dL . Preexisting neurotoxicity/neuropathy Grade 2 great accord NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2 . History preexist neurological disorder ( grade 3 high NCI Common Toxicity Criteria ; particular , seizure disorder ) . Patients underlie medical condition could aggravate treatment life threaten disease unrelated AML evaluate enrol physician . Patients active second malignancy , exclude adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix . Inability unwillingness comply treatment protocol .</criteria>
