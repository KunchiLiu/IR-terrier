	<brief_title>A Prospective Multi Centre Trial Bipolar Radiofrequency Ablation Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common persistent arrhythmia , prevalent 6 % population 65 year age . AF reduce quality life increase mortality . AF particularly common combination mitral valve disease , also detect 5 % patient aortic valve coronary artery disease . Surgical treatment AF Cox-maze III operation develop J. Cox 80ies . The aim operation block spread irregular electrical activity create line isolation atrial musculature . The operation achieve sinus rhythm 90 % select patient . Nevertheless method use heart surgical centre , complex time consuming.In recent year alternative energy source develop create isolating line without cut tissue thus make ablation treatment easy . Bipolar radiofrequency ablation special energy deliver feedback control transmurality achieve . This prerequisite good result make use equipment safer . Since development Cox-maze procedure , knowledge atrial fibrillation treatment increase considerably . There consensus posterior part leave atrium particular pulmonary vein important target treatment . Surgical ablation alternative energy source new method continue development evaluation . The optimal ablation treatment unknown . A balance invasiveness achieve sinus rhythm many possible found . Creating numerous ablation line atria time consume lead probably increase need permanent pacemaker implantation reduce contractility atrial tissue . On hand simple bipolar ablation pulmonary vein perform easily , probably insufficient treatment patient . In protocol new method use solely bipolar ablation creation several ablation line leave atrium described . The study prospective multi-centre study investigate effect new bipolar ablation strategy leave atrium patient paroxysmal permanent AF time .</detailed_description>
