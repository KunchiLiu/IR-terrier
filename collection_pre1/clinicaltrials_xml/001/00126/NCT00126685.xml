	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety tolerability vaccine therapy comprise autologous dendritic cell ( DC ) transfected autologous polymerase chain reaction-amplified tumor RNA patient stage IV cutaneous melanoma . - Determine whether tumor RNA- tumor antigen-specific T-cell response induce patient treated vaccine . - Determine whether major difference immunogenicity DC transfected immature stage mature stage patient treat vaccine . - Determine objective tumor response patient treat vaccine . - Determine time disease progression progression-free interval patient treat vaccine . - Determine overall survival patient treat vaccine . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized study . Patients sequentially assign receive dendritic cell ( DC ) transfected either immature mature stage . Approximately 2-3 week leukapheresis , patient undergo surgical excision biopsy tumor obtain tumor tissue RNA isolation . RNA amplify tumor sample polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Patients undergo leukapheresis harvest peripheral blood mononuclear cell production DC day -14 . DC immature mature stage transfected autologous PCR-amplified tumor RNA produce vaccine . Patients receive vaccine intradermally ( ID ) day 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 , day 71-74 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo evaluation day 71-74 . Patients respond stable disease minor disease progression receive booster vaccine ID day 99 , 127 , day 162-164 , day 205 , day 253-255 , 351-354 , 442-444 , 533-535 , 624-626 , 715-718 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also undergo additional leukapheresis day 71-74 , 351-354 , 715-718 . Patients respond stable disease may continue undergo leukapheresis receive booster vaccine ID every 12-24 week study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 8-30 patient accrue study within 6-12 month .</detailed_description>
