	<brief_title>Evidence Based Amputee Rehabilitation ( EBAR ) Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects pass eligibility requirement undergo baseline test examiner remain blind subject group assignment . Baseline test include AAS , six-minute walk test , AMPPro AMPnoPro . After baseline testing complete , subject randomly assign either intervention wait list control . Randomization occur block 20 panel 20 subject , 50 % randomize intervention 50 % randomize wait list control . Randomization perform use random-number table assign treatment group status subject 's unique identification number . Randomization status conceal record status card fold half group assignment inside fold . The card place envelope bear identification number . When subject complete baseline measure , envelope subject 's ID number open subject assign group . Subjects assign intervention group undergo clinical strength test . An individualized program develop subject base AMP test result clinical strength test . Subjects attend rehabilitation session 3 time per week 8 week . Each session last approximately 45 minute include require rest period . Subjects perform endurance , balance strengthening exercise session . Every 6th session , subject intervention group perform six-minute walk test , AMPPro complete AAS questionnaire . The result AMPPro test review therapeutic exercise program revise accord . After follow-up testing , subject assign wait list condition eligible attend 8-week rehabilitation program . Wait list subject exercise phase also receive exercise intervention describe . They also perform six-minute walk test , AMPPro complete AAS questionnaire every 6th session .</detailed_description>
