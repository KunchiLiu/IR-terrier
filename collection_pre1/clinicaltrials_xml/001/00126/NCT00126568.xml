	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Advanced Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether objective response rate ≥ 20 % patient advance anaplastic thyroid cancer treat sorafenib . II . Determine survival patient treat drug . III . Determine safety profile drug patient . IV . Determine pharmacokinetic predictor response drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow survival .</detailed_description>
