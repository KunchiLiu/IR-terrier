	<brief_summary>Patients advance stage cervix cancer treat radiotherapy . Overall , 50 % cure . Approximately half patient cured current cancer irradiate volume . Higher dose radiation would expect cure patient . To give high dos radiation safely , investigator need know precisely cancer use new technology available Cross Cancer Institute ( tomotherapy ) target cancer precisely , give high dos cancerous tissue low dos non-cancerous tissue . This study ten patient cervical cancer investigate add value MRI scan precise tumor definition facilitate accurate radiotherapy treatment planning . For study , patient treat conventional way conventional dos . The investigator hope treatment future patient plan MRI data treat high dos tomotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computed Tomotherapy ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Fusion Radiation Treatment Planning Patients With Cancer Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale/Background : For long time diagnostic imaging use planning radiation treatment carcinoma cervix , although essential part FIGO staging work . In past , treatment planning base examination anesthesia ( EUA ) find standard portal use . Various study show high risk geographical miss and/or inappropriate tumor coverage ( &gt; 70 % ) use standard portal , relate poor local control . Increasingly , diagnostic/planning CT MRI image use plan radiation treatment . Most patient invasive carcinoma cervix , candidate radical hysterectomy , treat radiotherapy , often concomitant chemotherapy curative intent . Amongst patient , cure achieve , significant proportion fail first pelvis . Higher dose radiation would expect reduce risk . With conventional radiotherapy , high dos radiation result high rate complication . New technology available Cross Cancer Institute ( tomotherapy + intensity modulate radiation therapy [ IMRT ] ) would expect permit high dose radiation deliver avoid increase risk complication . Accurate definition clinical target volume , compose cervix , uterus , gross primary tumor regional lymphatic drainage require accurate treatment planning . The MRI imaging expect valuable regard . Demonstrating immediate aim study . The investigator ' long term aim replace conventional external beam radiotherapy helical tomotherapy . They expect able apply increase dos radiation GTV + CTV monitor short-term treatment effect biological imaging , principally magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . Eventually investigator hope able individualize radiation dos base part biological imaging , treatment . In center investigator routinely perform diagnostic planning CT scan almost Ca . cervix patient radiation treatment planning . This study involve one additional MRI scan pelvis , take 30 minute perform ; process potential benefit treatment planning . Studies compare image modality diagnostic accuracy : There study CT MRI scan perform preoperatively result compare surgical-pathological outcome confirm diagnostic accuracy term tumor detection , parametrial invasion , lymph node status adjacent organ involvement . MRI consistently report accurate CT scan term tumor delineation normal organ localization . This also true meta-analysis 17 eligible study . Studies Comparing Imaging Modalities Treatment Planning : Not surprisingly CT plan show superior standard field technique external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) brachytherapy planning ca cervix patient . There less chance geographical miss use image modality planning . Studies compare MRI CT treatment planning show MRI lead significant change field border . Image Fusion : Harms W et al Germany study fusion CT MRI image sixteen patient treat interstitial ( n=12 ) endocavitary ( n=4 ) brachytherapy recurrent cervix , head neck , sarcoma vulva carcinoma . They compare conventional 3D-brachytherapy planning base CT-information alone brachytherapy plan base fused CT MRI data . They measure accuracy image fusion use predefined correspond landmark CT MRI data . They find automate algorithm robust reliable ( mean registration error 1.8 mm , range 0.8-4.1 mm , SD 0.9 mm ) ; tumor visualization difficult use CT alone ; brachytherapy treatment planning base fuse CT MRI data enable good definition target volume critical structure compare treatment plan base CT alone . Patients Methods : Ten patient histological diagnosis cervix carcinoma receive treatment Cross Cancer Institute enrol fusion study . They go usual investigation prior treatment planning , include CT imaging . In addition , patient MRI pelvis take approximately 30 minute . CT MRI image fuse use fusion software . Treatment plan standard four field box technique tomotherapy do CT image usual subsequently fuse image . Tumor coverage normal organ dos record compare . Tumor control probabilities normal tissue complication probability calculate different plan facilitate objective comparison . Conclusion : Most patient invasive carcinoma cervix , candidate radical hysterectomy , often treat concomitant chemo-radiation curative intent . Patients achieve cure treatment fail first pelvis . The high dos radiation would expect reduce risk , achieve conventional radiotherapy due high rate complication . Tomotherapy base treatment plan would expect obtain high dos radiation deliver avoid measure risk complication . More accurate definition clinical target volume , compose cervix , uterus , gross primary tumor regional lymphatic drainage require accurate treatment planning . Currently investigator plan basis CT scan center ; MRI scan consistently show superior CT treatment . Fusing MRI CT image expect delineate structure accurately compare CT alone therefore valuable accurate treatment planning deliver high dos CTV without increase treatment related complication . Objectives : 1 . To assess feasibility image fusion MRI CT radiotherapy ( RT ) planning Ca . Cervix 2 . To determine added value fuse MRI CT CT alone RT planning .</detailed_description>
