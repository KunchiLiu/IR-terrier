	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Efficacy BAY 43-9006 ( sorafenib tosylate ) evaluate response rate . II . Toxicities BAY 43-9006 metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . III . Intraoperative peri/postoperative safety BAY 43-9006 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Time progression . II . Duration response . II . Overall Survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Tissue expression VEGFR-2/phospho-VEGFR-2 , PDGFR/phospho-PDGFR , FGFR/phospho-FGFR , ERK/phospho-ERK , RAF-1/phospho-RAF-1 , p38/phospho-p38 , Akt/phospho-Akt , P27 , Ki67 , TGF-alpha , TUNEL pre- post- therapy ( optional study ) . II . Oligonucleotide analysis tissue pre- post-therapy ( optional study ) . OUTLINE : This non-randomized study . Patients sequentially assign 1 3 treatment group . GROUP I : Patients undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy day 1 . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 15-84 . GROUP II : Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-7 . Patients undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy day 8 . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 22-84 . GROUP III : Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Patients undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy day 29 . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 43-84 . In group , patient stable regress disease continue receive oral sorafenib twice daily 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient may continue treatment longer 1 year discretion investigator . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 45 patient ( 15 per treatment group ) accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
