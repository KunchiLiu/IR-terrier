	<brief_summary>The 13G01 clinical trial Phase I/II dose escalation study design conduct adult inflammatory arthritis persistent moderate severe swell one joint , without disease severe enough warrant change regimen next three month . The study permit subject concurrently anti-tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha antagonist . For subject disease modify antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) , stable regimen inflammatory arthritis previous three month , change dose four week prior screen require . The primary objective : 1. evaluate safety intra-articular administration tgAAC94 subject currently take TNF-alpha antagonist , 2. evaluate safety repeat intra-articular administration tgAAC94 ( gene therapy vector ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Intra-articular Delivery tgAAC94 Inflammatory Arthritis Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>tgAAC94 recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 ( AAV2 ) vector genetically engineer contain cDNA human tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) -immunoglobulin ( IgG1 ) Fc fusion ( TNFR : Fc ) gene . The DNA sequence TNFR : Fc tgAAC94 code protein sequence identical etanercept ( Enbrel® ) . TNF-alpha strongly implicated major participant inflammatory cascade lead joint damage destruction diseases rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) . Intra-articular delivery TNFR : Fc gene ( tgAAC94 ) result expression secrete protein joint space provide local high concentration soluble TNFR : Fc extend period time without require frequent administration . Thus , propose therapy would useful inflammatory arthritis patient persistently problematic joint despite use systemic TNF-alpha blockade limit number arthritic joint . Extensive preclinical study use rAAV2 contain several different transgene variety animal model show efficient persistent gene transfer expression minimal toxicity . The parent virus ( wild-type AAV2 ) naturally occur , non-replicating virus depend helper virus , adenovirus , replication . The recombinant AAV2 vector unable replicate target host cell lack AAV gene , whose protein product also require trans , replication packaging progeny virus . Extensive epidemiological study find AAV2 non-pathogenic . Although cure arthritis , treatment revolutionized advent anti-TNF-alpha therapy . These include etanercept ( Enbrel® ) , infliximab ( Remicade® ) adalimumab ( Humira® ) , consist soluble TNF receptor , chimeric human-mouse anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody fully human anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody , respectively . Clinical study show product improve sign symptom , inhibit structural damage , impact functional outcome patient inflammatory arthritides .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) , ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) diagnose accord establish criterion . Persistent moderate ( grade 2 ) severe ( grade 3 ) swell due inflammatory arthritis least one peripheral joint eligible injection . For subject RA , adequate trial least one diseasemodifying drug ( DMARD ) prior screen . For subject currently DMARD ( ) , stable regimen inflammatory arthritis previous three month , change dose four week prior screen . Age great 18 year less 75 year time screen . Willingness practice effective birth control measure study ( week 36 ) , male female reproductive ability . Able give write informed consent . Disease severe enough warrant change regimen inflammatory arthritis next three month . Discontinuation etanercept past safety concern . Current use anakinra ( Kineret® ) abatacept ( Orencia® ) . Corticosteroid therapy dose high equivalent 10 mg prednisone per day . Steroid hyaluronate injection target joint receipt investigational agent less four week prior screen . Class IV ACR functional status ( Hochberg et al. , 1992 ) . Any follow laboratory value : Hemoglobin &lt; 8.5 gm/dL , white blood cell count &lt; 3500 per mm cube , platelet &lt; 100 K/uL , creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL , bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL , AST ALT &gt; 2 time upper limit normal , abnormal coagulation profile ( &gt; 2 second beyond upper range normal PT PTT ) . Known HIV infection , know hepatitis C infection , know positive serologic test hepatitis B surface antigen . Positive PPD , unless previously treat appropriate prophylaxis . Pregnancy lactation , either time screen plan next 18 month . Inflammatory bowel disease , Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . Serious medical disease , severe liver kidney disease , uncompensated congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within six month , unstable angina , uncontrolled hypertension , severe pulmonary disease uncontrolled asthma , demyelinate neurological disease , history cancer ( cutaneous basal squamous cell carcinoma ) less five year documentation diseasefree state , insulindependent diabetes , recurrent opportunistic infection concurrent medical condition , opinion investigator , would make subject unsuitable study . Unlikely comply protocol .</criteria>
