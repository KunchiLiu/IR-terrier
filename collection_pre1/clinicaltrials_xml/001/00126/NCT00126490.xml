	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together interleukin-2 work treat patient metastatic kidney cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Interleukin-2 may stimulate white blood cell kill tumor cell . Giving bevacizumab together interleukin-2 may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine frequency major response patient metastatic renal cell cancer treat bevacizumab interleukin-2 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I . Compare median progression-free survival median overall survival patient treat regimen risk-stratified historical control publish risk model . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 . Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously day 1-5 week 5-10 . Treatment repeat every 12 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease receive bevacizumab alone week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 . Courses bevacizumab alone repeat every 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month least 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 10-38 patient accrue study within 21 month .</detailed_description>
