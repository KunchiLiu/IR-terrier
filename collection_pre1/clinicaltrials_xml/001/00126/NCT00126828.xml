	<brief_summary>Patients limited stage small cell lung cancer presently treat chemotherapy radiation therapy ( RT ) . Despite aggressive treatment vast majority patient cancer recur treatment . A recurrence curable time , therefore effort reduce recurrence rate desirable . Due sensitivity surround structure chest radiation , possible give dos cure tumour . Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy special form radiation therapy allow doctor reduce amount radiation dose normal tissue therefore reduce toxicity turn , let safely increase dose tumour . The purpose study determine whether combination three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy chemotherapy effective treatment . If treatment find safe first group patient , total radiation dose increase next group patient treat study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Radiation Dose Intensity Concurrent With Chemotherapy For Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy represent one primary treatment modality patient limited stage small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . With contemporary concurrent radiotherapy chemotherapy , approximately 20 % patient survive 5 year . While distant metastasis common , local ( intrathoracic ) failures common well , occur 40 % treated patient . Reducing local failure rate may lead improved survival patient . There appear grow body data , suggest radiation dose response relationship SCLC . However , close proximity critical normal structure , spinal cord esophagus , primary tumour limit prescription dose conventional radiotherapy . Three Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy ( 3DCRT ) offer possibility reduce normal tissue irradiation hence reduce treatment toxicity maintain dose radiation tumour . Another strategy accelerate fractionation , shorten treatment time allow less opportunity tumour cell repopulation . The use 3DCRT large radiation fraction size maintain satisfactory treatment related toxicity permit potential gain accelerate fractionation dose escalation . In study , patient limit stage SCLC eligible treat large field ( low dose ) radiotherapy follow accelerated 3DCRT give concurrently standard Cisplatin Etoposide chemotherapy . Primary Objective : To determine maximum tolerable dose radiotherapy SCLC Secondary Objectives : 1 . To assess treatment toxicity 2 . To assess quality life retention pulmonary function 3 . To assess progression-free survival regimen Schema : Eligible patient receive 4 cycle Cisplatin Etoposide chemotherapy . Thoracic radiotherapy give concurrently start cycle # 2 chemotherapy . Only one dose level open time . Four dose level plan deliver 25 fraction daily 5 week : 1 . 50 Gy ( 2 Gy per fraction ) , 2 . 58 Gy , 3 . 62 Gy , 4 . 65 Gy . Patients , achieve complete response end chemotherapy thoracic radiotherapy , receive prophylactic cranial irradiation . Evaluation Follow-up : Patients assess evaluate least weekly radiation therapy . Following treatment , patient see 1 month completion treatment , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month . Chest x-rays perform follow-up . CT scan chest pulmonary function test perform every 6 month first 2 year , yearly .</detailed_description>
