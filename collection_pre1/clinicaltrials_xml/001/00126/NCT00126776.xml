	<detailed_description>Study design plan : This one-year , 5-site randomized trial . High-risk patient randomize usual care case/self management intervention . The frequency urgent care visit admission hospital COPD compare . Study procedure : visit 1 Patient inform consent obtain prior patient participation trial . Patients also sign release information form obtain outside record COPD admission urgent care visit . Demographic data , inclusion/exclusion data , medication problem list obtain . Post-albuterol force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) perform use calibrated spirometer accordance guideline establish American Thoracic Society . A uniform set nomogram ( NHANES III ) use site . The best three effort define high FEV1 high FVC obtain three blow ( even curve maximum 5 attempt ) . Patients meet criterion agree participation randomize usual care case/self management intervention , mean seal sequentially numbered envelope site . Patients randomize case/self management intervention receive 1-2 hour education ( appendix 1 ) . These patient give instruction self-management exacerbation telephone care contact number . Coordinators confirm patient instruct , possession , standard pharmacologic treatment exacerbation , include 10 day supply oral prednisone oral antibiotic . Prednisone dose regimen specific antibiotic determine site PI accord local sensitivity practice pattern , access current disease management recommendation information . Study procedure : treatment period All patient contact telephone every 6 week blind centralize study staff member inquire interim urgent care visit hospitalization COPD exacerbation accord scripted case report form . Patients intervention arm contact site coordinator monthly reinforce educational principle assist patient disease management question concern . Study procedure : end trial At end one year quality life score ( SF36 St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire , VISN 23 patient satisfaction survey , brief questionnaire regard current influenza pneumococcal vaccination status , smoke status , average number minute exercise per day mail patient .</detailed_description>
