	<detailed_description>Malaria infection pregnancy pose substantial risk mother , fetus , neonate . In area stable transmission adult woman considerable acquired immunity , Plasmodium falciparum infection pregnancy typically cause symptomatic malaria , may lead maternal anemia placental malaria infection , especially among primigravidae secundigravidae . This placental malarial infection contributes low birth weight ( LBW ) , major contributor infant mortality . Malaria contribute 15 % maternal anemia , 14 % LBW , 30 % preventable LBW , 70 % intrauterine growth retardation , 36 % premature delivery , 8 % infant mortality . In Mali , malaria lead cause morbidity ( 15 % ) mortality ( 13 % ) general population ( Kassoum Kayentao , personal communication ) . Malaria find 25.9 % pregnant woman attend antenatal care , placenta 27.8 % pregnant woman delivery ( Kassoum Kayentao , personal communication ) . Controlling malaria pregnancy vital strategy decrease maternal child mortality Africa . There data clinical trial program evaluation stable transmission area show intermittent preventive treatment ( IPT ) two dos sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) safe , efficacious , effective prevent maternal anemia , placental parasitemia , LBW . SP also first-line drug case-management malaria pregnancy . Resistance SP , however , increase rapidly East Central Africa compliance rescue treatment , 7-days oral quinine , low . There urgent need find effective , safe practical alternative drug treatment malaria pregnancy . The synergistic antifolate combination chlorproguanil-dapsone ( CD ) , recently become available fixed combination caplet 80 mg chlorproguanil 100 mg dapsone ( Lapdapâ„¢ , GlaxoSmithKline , UK ) . It inexpensive ( $ 0.29 per treatment course ) , well tolerate , give single daily treatment dose 3 day , effective treatment drug-resistant falciparum malaria . CD however good efficacy salvage therapy SP treatment failure child could play important role case management malaria pregnancy . Given component drug consider safe pregnancy , expect combination also safe use pregnancy , formally evaluate . The investigator propose small pharmacokinetic study CD determine current co-formulated fix combination CD tablet provide adequate dosage pregnancy . Such study necessary precursor large Phase II trial evaluate safety efficacy CD use pregnant woman . Therefore , primary objective study evaluate pharmacokinetics CD pregnancy . To accomplish , group 66 parasitemic pregnant woman open label trial receive CD sample venipuncture two seven follow-up visit schedule pharmacokinetic analysis , 11 patient sample 12 time point . To serve reference , 66 non-pregnant woman symptomatic malaria also treat CD identical PK analysis perform . There also data show woman use insecticide treat bednets ( ITNs ) pregnancy also less likely suffer adverse outcome malaria pregnancy . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) currently recommend pregnant woman malaria endemic area sleep ITN receive least 2 dos IPT efficacious antimalarial 2nd 3rd trimester . The combined efficacy ITNs IPT remain unclear . It important understand short-acting antimalarial CD function well long-acting drug SP prevent malaria pregnancy among woman also sleep ITN . Therefore , secondary aim estimate proportion pregnant woman sleep ITNs become re-infected malaria delivery follow administration single dose chlorproguanil-dapsone P. falciparum parasitemia . Eligible pregnant woman great equal 20 week gestation P. falciparum parasitemia peripheral blood film , history antimalarial use chloroquine quinine , give consent participate give ITN receive CD ( 1.5 2 tablet daily 3 day , depend weight ) All study drug dose observe . Women examine , adverse event record , blood sample collect day 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 treatment , thereafter every 14 day delivery . Women randomize receive additional blood draw pharmacokinetic analysis use modify rich PK schedule . Each woman 2 additional blood draw . Women delivery peripheral placental blood film prepare . Newborns weigh , examine , gestational age determine . Women require antimalarial treatment parasitemia point enrollment delivery treat quinine . Adverse effect assess scheduled visit , sick visit study , delivery . An independent external monitor recruit visit study site begin field work end study . Standard pharmacokinetic measurement use high-pressure liquid chromatography perform determine serum CD level . Determination malaria parasitemia ( peripheral placental ) make read thick Giemsa-stained blood film . Birth weight measure use electronic scale ( +/- 10g ) . Gestational age estimate use Ballard score . All woman receive ITN enrollment reduce probability new malaria infection mother newborn .</detailed_description>
