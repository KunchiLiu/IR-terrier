	<brief_summary>The standard treatment metastatic colorectal cancer base systemic chemotherapy . Several effective drug currently available administer either sequentially combination . Most patient receive 2 3 line chemotherapy . The aim randomize trial evaluate potential benefit bitherapy 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) oxaliplatin first line chemotherapy compare sequential chemotherapy 5-FU alone first line chemotherapy follow combination 5-FU oxaliplatin case progressive disease , term progression-free survival overall survival patient advance colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Two Strategies Chemotherapy Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The addition oxaliplatin irinotecan 5-FU improves tumor response rate progression-free survival patient advance colorectal cancer compare 5-FU alone , increase toxicity . It clear whether combination therapy ( 5-FU+oxaliplatin 5-FU+irinotecan ) systematically use first line treatment second line treatment 5-FU failure . Design : open-label , multicentric , randomized trial Aim : The main objective multiline strategy trial compare two 5-FU base regimen without addition oxaliplatin 5-FU first line set term progression-free survival two line chemotherapy patient metastatic colorectal cancer . Treatment compare : Control arm : first line , 2-hour infusion 400 mg/m² leucovorin ( LV ) follow 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m² 46-hours 2,400 mg/m² every 2 week ( LV5FU2 ) , second line , LV5FU2 + oxaliplatin 100 mg/m² 2-hour perfusion day 1 ( FOLFOX6 ) , third line , LV5FU2 + irinotecan 180 mg/m² ( FOLFIRI ) Experimental arm : first line , FOLFOX6 , second line , FOLFIRI , third line , 5-FU 250 mg/m²/day continuous perfusion 7 8 week capecitabine 2,500 mg/m² per oral 14 21 day inclusion phase I Inclusion criterion : - Histologically confirm metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma - Unresectable metastasis - Bidimensionally measurable disease ( WHO criteria ) - WHO performance status 2 less - Adequate hematologic , renal function liver function - No previous chemotherapy previous adjuvant chemotherapy concomitant chemoradiotherapy 5-fluorouracil leucovorin treatment primary tumor complete least 6 month inclusion - Signed write inform consent - Quality life questionnaire ( QLQ C-30 ) fill Exclusion criterion : - Pregnant breast-feeding woman - No possible regular follow-up psychological , social geographical reason - Severe cardiac , respiratory , renal hepatic failure - Active coronary heart disease - Central nervous system metastases - Past history second malignancy - Another investigational drug - Chronic inflammatory bowel disease - Previous chemotherapy irinotecan oxaliplatin base regimens Randomization : Randomization perform centrally use minimization technique , stratify patient accord centre , previous adjuvant treatment , WHO performance status , number metastatic site Outcomes : Progression-free survival two line chemotherapy , define time duration randomization progression two line chemotherapy death whatever cause absence progression last-follow-up . Overall survival , secondary surgery , response rate , progression-free survival first third line chemotherapy , safety , quality life cost Follow-up : Tumor assessment perform every 8 week , quality live assessment every 8 week progression 2 line chemotherapy one year progression . After end plan treatment , patient follow death cut-off date . Sample size statistical analysis : 570 patient , 285 per arm need detect difference median progression-free survival two line chemotherapy 3 month 10 month control arm 13 month experimental arm , type I error 5 % power 80 % ( bilateral log rank test ) . The analysis perform accord intent-to treat principle . An interim analysis plan inclusion 400 patient 3 month follow-up occurrence 250 event review independent data monitoring committee . Estimated duration trial : accrual period , 3 year , minimum follow-up , one year</detailed_description>
