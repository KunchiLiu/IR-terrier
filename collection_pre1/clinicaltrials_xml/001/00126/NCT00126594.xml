	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study sorafenib interferon alfa-2b see well work compare sorafenib alone treat patient metastatic kidney cancer . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Interferon alfa-2b may interfere growth tumor cell . Sorafenib interferon alfa-2b may also block blood flow tumor . Giving sorafenib together interferon alfa-2b may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate With Without Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Efficacy Bay 43-9006 without low dose interferon evaluate response rate MRCC . II . Toxicities Bay 43-9006 without low dose interferon MRCC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Progression free survival . II . Duration response . III . Overall Survival . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Arm II : Patients receive sorafenib arm I low-dose interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously twice daily day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence progressive disease unacceptable toxicity . Tissue sample analyze single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) pattern via genotyping . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
