	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose sorafenib tosylate bevacizumab see well work treat patient advanced kidney cancer . Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth target certain cell . Bevacizumab sorafenib tosylate may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving sorafenib tosylate together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tolerability maximum tolerate dose Sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) give orally combination Bevacizumab patient renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . ( Phase I ) II . To estimate objective response rate advance RCC receive combination therapy Bevacizumab Sorafenib . ( Phase II ) III . To estimate progression-free survival advance renal cell carcinoma patient Sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) combination Bevacizumab . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain fixed tissue form paraffin block unstained slide evaluation follow : von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor , E3 ubiquitin protein ligase ( VHL ) mutation status phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) mutation and/or expression status ; VHL downstream protein ; Apoptosis proliferation status ; Microvascular density , able process ; kinase status- phosphorylation , inactive mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase , v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( Akt ) kinase insert domain receptor ( KDR ) feasible . II . In situation fresh tumor may obtain prior and/or follow therapy ( 4 week ) 1 . Assess tumor baseline change signal transduction - Raf-1 proto-oncogene , serine/threonine kinase ( Raf ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ( Erk ) , Erk phosphorylation , Akt phosphorylation status Raf subcellular localization . 2. fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 ( VEGFR1 ) ( flk1 ) kinase insert domain receptor ( VEGFR2 ) ( flt1/KDR ) status tissue vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . 3 . Tumor cell apoptosis - marker proliferation Ki-67 ( Ki-67 ) , transferase dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) staining , expression level BH3 interact domain death agonist ( BH3 ) domain contain protein . 4 . Tumor blood vessel characteristic - microvessel density , fraction immature tumor blood vessel , endothelial cell apoptosis . 5 . Presence VHL downstream proteins III . To relate change tumor perfusion vascular permeability serial arterial spin label ( ASL ) dynamic contrast-enhanced ( DCE ) -magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) clinical outcome anti-tumor effect . IV . Evaluate pharmacokinetics Sorafenib ( alone combination ) bevacizumab patient enrol maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose level Sorafenib bevacizumab represent recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) schedule ( 200mg daily [ QD ] Sorafenib 5 mg/kg intravenously [ IV ] Q 2 week bevacizumab ) . V. To determine steady-state trough plasma concentration Sorafenib trough concentration Bevacizumab relate toxicity correlative endpoint . VI . Serial analysis circulate angiogenic cytokine ( i.e . VEGF , angiopoeitin 2 , basic fibroblast growth factor [ bFGF ] , interleukin [ IL ] -8 etc ) association finding response , response duration prediction relapse . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily day 1-28 bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos sorafenib tosylate bevacizumab maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . An additional 6 patient treated MTD . PHASE II : Patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO daily day 1-28 bevacizumab IV 90 minute day 1 15 MTD absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity* . [ Note : *Patients may remain protocol 1 drug stop . ] After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
