	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well erlotinib hydrochloride without carboplatin paclitaxel work treat patient stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving erlotinib hydrochloride together carboplatin paclitaxel may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride With Without Carboplatin Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine distribution progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient previously untreated advanced adenocarcinoma lung never light former smoker treat either OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) alone ( arm A ) combination carboplatin/paclitaxel ( arm B ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine radiographic response rate patient previously untreated advanced adenocarcinoma lung never light former smoker treat either OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) alone ( arm A ) combination carboplatin/paclitaxel ( arm B ) . II . To determine frequency epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( K-ras ) mutation anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) translocation patient previously untreated advanced adenocarcinoma lung never light former smoker . III . To determine response rate time progression patient without EGFR mutation treat either OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) alone ( arm A ) combination carboplatin/paclitaxel ( arm B ) . IV . To determine response rate time progression patient without K-ras mutation treat either OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) alone ( arm A ) combination carboplatin/paclitaxel ( arm B ) . V. To determine median overall survival patient previously untreated advanced adenocarcinoma lung never light former smoker treat either OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) alone ( arm A ) combination carboplatin/paclitaxel ( arm B ) . VI . To estimate response rate , progression-free , overall survival patient echinoderm microtubule associate protein like ( EML ) 4-ALK translocation receive OSI-774 erlotinib alone ( arm A ) combination carboplatin/paclitaxel ( arm B ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride Arm I . Patients also receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1-3 hour carboplatin IV 15-30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 6 course treatment , patient may continue receive erlotinib hydrochloride alone . After completion study treatment , patient follow least every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
