	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Salivary Gland Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) patient advance high-grade salivary gland carcinoma treat trastuzumab . II . To assess one-year progression-free survival one-year overall survival patient treat regimen . III . To assess toxicity associate treatment regimen group patient . IV . To measure indicator C-erb B2 oncoprotein expression C-erb B2 oncogene amplification epidermal growth factor receptor expression explore relationship marker response , progression-free survival overall survival preliminary fashion . OUTLINE : Patients receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 8 week disease progression every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year study entry .</detailed_description>
