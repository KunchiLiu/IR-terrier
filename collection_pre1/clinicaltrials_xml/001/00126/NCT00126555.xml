	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery and/or Radiation Therapy Locally Advanced Recurrent Squamous Cell Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Early progression rate ( progression ZD1839 induction ) . II . Feasibility induction ZD1839 ( patient ) concomitant ZD1839 radiotherapy ( unresectable patient ) . III . Toxicities induction ZD1839 ( patient ) concomitant ZD1839 radiotherapy ( unresectable patient ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Response : clinical response induction therapy . II . Failures : frequency time local distant failure . III . Biomarkers : biomarker level tumor normal tissue . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . For progressive disease responder , patient follow locoregional distant metastasis data . II . Feasibility maintenance ZD1839 . III . Toxicities maintenance ZD1839 . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 group . STRATUM I ( initially resectable tumor ) : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily ( QD ) 5 day week approximately 6-7 week . Patients also receive gefitinib orally ( PO ) QD 12 month STRATUM II ( initially unresectable tumor ) : Patients undergo radiotherapy QD 5 day week approximately 6-7 week . Patients also receive concurrent gefitinib PO QD 6-7 week . Patients undergo surgery . After surgery , patient receive gefitinib PO QD 12 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
