	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together erlotinib work treat patient recurrent metastatic ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cavity cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving bevacizumab together erlotinib may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Erlotinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient recurrent metastatic ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cavity cancer treat bevacizumab erlotinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxic effect regimen patient . II . Determine median progression-free survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Patients also receive oral erlotinib daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience unacceptable toxicity due 1 study drug may continue treatment remain study drug alone absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
