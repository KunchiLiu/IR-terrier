	<brief_summary>Preliminary response data , observe Casali ( Cancer , 2004 ) imatinib 800 mg/day patient affect chordoma , need confirm Phase II study , whose primary endpoint formal assessment clinical pathological response . Aim study explore treatment 's activity , also potential impact tumor response , feasibility outcome subsequent surgery radiotherapy . In addition , pattern tumour response need investigate well , give peculiar pattern response show molecular-targeted therapy solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Histological diagnosis chordoma . 2 . Biomolecular immunohistochemical evidence Imatinib mesylate target ( PDGFRβ activation and/or presence PDGFB ) . Biomolecular assessment PDGFRβ activation make whenever possible . To end , frozen material available , obtain , fresh material encourage , obtain major distress patient , preferably incisional biopsy ( allow immunoprecipitation ) , feasible , Trucut biopsy ( allow Western Blot assessment ) . However , frozen fresh material obtain , paraffined material also acceptable . The biomolecular assessment centralize reference center ( define ) . 3 . Measurable evaluable disease 4 . Surgical resection local disease unfeasible radically , unaccepted patient , amenable become less demolitive , easy , likely feasible , cytoreduction , and/or metastatic disease . Debulking surgery enrolment allow . In case , enrolment occur least one month surgery 5 . Performance status 0 , 1 , 2 3 ( ECOG ) ( see § 8.1 ) . 6 . Adequate end organ function , define follow : total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN , SGOT SGPT &lt; 2.5 x UNL ( &lt; 5 x ULN hepatic metastasis present ) , creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN . 7 . Adequate bone marrow function , define follow : ANC &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L , platelet &gt; 100 x 10^9/L , Hb &gt; 9 g/dL . Blood transfusion allow reach baseline request Hb level . 8 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day initiation study drug dosing . Post menopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Male female patient reproductive potential must agree employ effective method birth control throughout study 3 month follow discontinuation study drug . 9 . Written , voluntary , informed consent . 1 . Previous treatment investigational investigational agent within 28 day first day study drug dose . 2 . Other primary malignancy &lt; 5 year clinically assess diseasefree interval , except basal cell skin cancer , cervical carcinoma situ , neoplasms judge entail low risk relapse . 3 . Grade III/IV cardiac problem define New York Heart Association Criteria ( i.e. , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month study ) 4 . Severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease ( i.e. , uncontrolled diabetes , chronic renal disease , active uncontrolled infection ) . 5 . Known brain metastasis . 6 . Known chronic liver disease ( i.e. , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis ) . 7 . Known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . 8 . Previous radiotherapy &gt; =25 % bone marrow . 9 . Major surgery within 2 week prior study entry . 10 . Expected noncompliance medical regimen .</criteria>
