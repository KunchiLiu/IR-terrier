	<brief_title>Tetrathiomolybdate Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tetrathiomolybdate TM , drug develop Wilson 's Disease , remove copper bloodstream . Copper key factor angiogenesis ( blood vessel growth ) - process occur normally body becomes uncontrolled cancerous cell . Tetrathiomolybdate essentially wag war copper , serve choke tumor growth . Realizing key role copper angiogenesis , researcher begin explore treatment Tetrathiomolybdate different type cancer . This clinical trial evaluate effectiveness Tetrathiomolybdate treatment patient hormone refractory prostate cancer . Hormone refractory prostate cancer refers advance disease patient longer respond conventional hormonal treatment .</detailed_description>
