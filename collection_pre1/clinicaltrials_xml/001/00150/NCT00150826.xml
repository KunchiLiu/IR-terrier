	<brief_summary>INDICATION Microvascular angina . OBJECTIVES To investigate effect ACE ( angiotensin convert enzyme ) inhibition ( quinapril ) improve coronary microvascular function . PATIENT POPULATION Women meet National Heart , Lung Blood Institute-sponsored WISE ( Women Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation ) study criterion chest discomfort , coronary flow reserve limitation evidence myocardial ischemia absence significant coronary artery stenosis . STUDY DESIGN A prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , comparative trial . TREATMENT Quinapril 80 mg/d versus placebo four month . PRIMARY EFFICACY PARAMETER ( S ) Coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) Week 16 adjusted baseline CFR , treatment group assignment , site-specific variable , site treatment effect . SECONDARY EFFICACY PARAMETERS Week 16 change chest discomfort measure Seattle Angina Questionnaire adjust baseline value , site , site treatment effect . SAFETY PARAMETERS Hematology , blood chemistry , blood pressure pulse , frequency occurrence adverse event . STATISTICAL RATIONALE AND ANALYSIS A statistical rationale number patient study provide . Interim analysis plan 15 patient enrol group . ANTICIPATED TOTAL NUMBER OF PATIENTS 78 ( 39 per group ) . ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF PATIENTS AT EACH SITE Approximately 26</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>QWISE - Study Quinapril Women With Chest Pain , Coronary Flow Reserve Limitations Evidence Myocardial Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , comparative trial evaluate effect ACE inhibition microvascular function woman coronary flow reserve limitation chest discomfort . Women enrol WISE study enrol ancillary study meet study criterion . Women enrol WISE study also enter ancillary study long meet study criterion . After WISE evaluation include symptom assessment use Seattle Angina Questionnaire ( SAQ ) document reduced coronary blood flow reserve ( &lt; 3.0 velocity ) , patient randomize double-blind placebo quinapril ( start 40 mg/d titrate 80 mg/d end first week ) . After treatment maximum tolerate dose 16 week , patient reevaluate coronary angiogram coronary flow reserve measurement assessment angina use SAQ .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Non pregnant woman chest discomfort 21 75 year age diverse racial/ethnic group . 2 . Suspected ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) severe coronary stenosis ( &gt; 50 % diameter reduction ) coronary angiography use qualify WISE . 3 . Coronary flow reserve limitation ( &lt; 3.0 velocity ) . 1 . Women breastfeed pregnant . Women childbearing potential may enrol must agree become pregnant course study must practice method birth control consider reliable investigator . If establish hormonal contraceptive 3 month , patient allow participate providing therapy remain constant throughout study . If patient becomes pregnant begin breastfeed study , must withdraw immediately . 2 . Acute ischemic syndrome define acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) ( enzyme electrocardiogram ( ECG ) criterion ) unstable angina within 1 month entry . 3 . Uncontrolled moderate hypertension : Sitting blood pressure &gt; 160/95mmHg measurement record least 2 occasion ( blood pressure control , patient must first stabilize , preferably diuretic , keep dose regimen throughout participation study ) . 4 . Severe heart failure define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV treatment . 5 . Coronary revascularization either coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) Stent Placement . 6 . Conditions likely influence outcomes independent IHD : Severe lung , renal ( creatinine &gt; 3.0 ) hepatic disease , surgically uncorrected significant congenital valvular heart disease disease likely fatal require frequent hospitalization within next six month . 7 . Adherence retention reason : Recent alcoholism drug abuse , psychiatric illness include severe depression , dementia , active participation research trial WISE , unwilling complete followup evaluation include repeat testing . 8 . Hypersensitivity medication use study ( e.g . angioedema ACEI ) . 9 . Documented obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . 10 . Aortic stenosis ( valve area &lt; 1.5cm ) . 11 . LV dysfunction ( ejection fraction &lt; =35 % ) . 12 . History cocaine amphetamine abuse . 13 . ACEI angiotension 1 ( AT1 ) receptor blocker use within 30 day need continued ACEI/AT1RB use .</criteria>
