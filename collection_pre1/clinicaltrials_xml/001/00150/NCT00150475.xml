	<brief_title>Contamination During Removal Two Different Personal Protective Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Highly communicable virulent disease severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) “ avian influenza ” , ongoing threat emerge infectious disease , prospect bio-terrorism become part new reality health care worker ( 1 ) . Recent experience SARS demonstrate front-line health care professional perform assist aerosol generate procedure particularly increase risk infection . At present , data exists address question self-contamination removal personal protective system use health care set . The late suggested don removal procedure validate respect issue selfcontamination due deficiency contact precaution . The failure personal protective system don removal procedure personal protective system may associate significant consequence term morbidity mortality front-line health care worker . It imperative rate self-contamination two personal protective system assess . The purpose study determine difference exist rate self-contamination due deficiency contact precaution individual wear either Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) Powered Air Purifying Respirator ( PAPR ) . This prospective , randomize , control , crossover study . Institutional Ethics Committee approval obtain study . Fifty participant require study . Participants recruit Department Anesthesiology attend resident staff , physician group require PAPR training , Department Respiratory Therapy . Recruitment occur conjunction annual training use PAPR . Individuals inform purpose procedure study write consent obtain . Individuals exclude refuse provide write consent participate study . Participants wear operating room scrub attire base clothing layer . They randomize either PAPR PPE . They repeat process use personal protective system immediately study protocol complete use first personal protective system . PPE consist N95 respirator , goggles , face shield , bouffant hair cover , fluid resistant surgical gown , fit sterile glove . Although CDC omit head cover part PPE , MOHLTC directives stipulate head cover must wear perform high-risk procedure patient require enhanced respiratory contact precaution . A head cover ( bouffant hair cover ) therefore form part PPE use study . The CDC recommendation state goggles wear eye protection . A face shield use addition goggles optional . The MOHLTC directives state goggles face shield must wear high-risk procedure patient require enhanced respiratory contact precaution . Goggles face shield therefore form part PPE study . Therefore don removal instruction PPE use study differ sequence publish CDC . The don removal procedure use study closely follow sequence recommend MOHLTC indeed enhance version directive . PAPR consist body suit shoe cover , PAPR hood power unit , N95 respirator , goggles , face shield , bouffant hair cover , fluid resistant surgical gown , fit sterile glove . The MOHLTC stipulate use donning/removal coach PAPR . Neither CDC , MOHLTC , institution stipulate use donning/removal coach PPE . The intent study examine protective system . The don removal procedure form part protective system may either contribute minimize self-contamination rate must assess actual condition use . In order best simulate actual condition health care worker subject best evaluate don removal procedure practice also decide employ donning/removal coach PPE . Accordingly , don removal PPE participant give standardized write instruction outline don removal procedure coach . Participants give standardized write instruction coach respiratory therapist don removal PAPR . The standardized write instruction don removal PPE PAPR attach Appendices A B . All participant time videotaped protective system don procedure . Timing commence participant instruct begin read 3 write don instruction PPE dress coach say “ begin ” PAPR . Timing cease participant complete don final item protective system test . Videotaping occur order record assist detection protective system don procedure violation . A donning procedure violation define occur participant perform don maneuver sequence touch piece protective equipment sequence . Participants “ contaminate ” use solution fluorescein ( 1ml 25 % solution dilute 100cc sterile water ) standardize fashion . A Devilbiss atomizer ( Model DV-15-RD , Sunrise Medical Products , Carlsbad , California , USA ) use apply 5ml fluorescein solution front face shield torso . We choose contamination site order simulate area would likely contaminate large respiratory droplet aerosolize patient either cough react intubation attempt high-risk respiratory procedure . The atomizer nozzle hold distance 30cm participant ’ face-shield applied shoulder level . The spray stream direct participant ’ nose aim inferiorly towards umbilicus upwards downwards sweep motion keep atomizer orient participant ’ mid-saggital plane . Application occur atomizer reservoir empty . During application participant ’ eye close . “ Invisible ” Detection Paste ( Sirchie , 100 Hunter Place , Youngsville , NC ) apply palmar aspect participant ’ hand anterior posterior forearm elbow . Although paste label “ invisible detection paste ” become visible viewed ultraviolet ( UV ) light . 15ml paste use . We choose use detection paste forearm glove study participant area likely come contact patient require enhance contact respiratory precaution . Participants videotape , photograph digital camera , assess UV lamp ( Burton Medical Products Inc , 21100 Lassen Street , Chatsworth , CA . 91311 USA ) follow contamination ensure standardize contamination front face shield , torso , forearm , palmar aspect gloved hand achieve . Participants follow standardize write removal procedure protective system wear . They time videotape protective system removal procedure . Timing commence participant instruct begin read write removal instruction PPE dress coach say “ begin ” PAPR . Timing paused assessment UV lamp . Timing cease participant complete remove final item protective system test . Videotaping occur order record assist detection protective system removal procedure violation . A removal procedure violation define occur participant perform removal maneuver sequence , touch piece protective equipment 4 sequence , touch part body piece protective equipment prior perform final hand disinfection . Participants assess UV lamp specific interval removal procedure order detect visible contamination . Participants PPE assess UV lamp follow removal out PPE protective layer ( outer fit sterile glove , fluid resistant surgical gown , faceshield ) . Final assessment occur removal inner PPE protective layer ( N95 mask , goggles , bouffant hair cover , inner fit sterile glove ) . Participants PAPR assess use UV lamp removal outer PAPR protective layer ( PAPR hood power unit , outer fluid resistant surgical gown , out boot cover , outer fit sterile glove ) . They assess removal middle PAPR protective layer ( body suit , middle sterile fit glove , boot cover ) . Final assessment occur removal inner PAPR protective layer ( N95 mask , goggles , bouffant hair cover , inner sterile fit glove ) . An evaluator blind participant ’ protective system perform final assessment . All area participant ’ base clothing layer expose skin hair inspect removal final protective layer . This include participant ’ face . Contamination episodes count contamination area calculate cm2 .</detailed_description>
