	<brief_summary>Background : The use radioactive iodine ( 131I ) therapy definite cure hyperthyroidism widespread . According survey management Graves ' disease , thirty per cent physician prefer render patient euthyroid antithyroid drug ( ATD ) prior 131I therapy . This strategy presumably choose avoid 131I induced 'thyroid storm ' , , however , rarely encounter . Several study consistently show patient treat ATD prior 131I therapy increase risk treatment failure . Mostly , patient Graves ' disease study , study address also toxic nodular goiter . Thus , generally accept ATD 'radioprotective ' property , although view almost exclusively base retrospective data still debate . Indeed , dogma recently challenge two randomized trial Graves ' disease , none show adverse effect methimazole pretreatment . It exclude earlier result may influence selection bias , source error almost unavoidable retrospective study . Whether ATD radioprotective also use post 131I period also debate . In early period 131I therapy follow transient rise thyroid hormone see may give rise discomfort patient . The continuous use ATD 131I therapy , possibly combination levothyroxine ( BRT : block-replacement therapy ) , lead stable level thyroid hormone . By resume ATD follow 131I therapy , euthyroidism usually maintain destructive effect 131I ensues . Nevertheless , many physician prefer resume ATD , probably due report support strategy reduces cure rate . Parallel issue ATD pretreatment , evidence base retrospective study ideal set-up reconsider . To underscore importance perform randomize trial show recently resumption methimazole seven day 131I therapy influence final outcome . Aim : To clarify randomized trial whether BRT radioiodine therapy hyperthyroid patient influence final outcome therapy , comparison regime methimazole mono-therapy discontinue 8 day radioiodine . Patients Methods : Consecutive patient suffer recurrent Graves ' disease ( n=50 ) toxic nodular goiter ( n=50 ) include . All patient render euthyroid methimazole ( MMI ) randomize either stop MMI eight day 131I set BRT . This latter medication continue three month 131I . Calculation 131I activity ( max . 600 MBq ) include assessment 131I half-life thyroid volume . Patients follow one year close monitoring thyroid function .</brief_summary>
