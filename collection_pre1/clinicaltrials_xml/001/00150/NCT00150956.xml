	<brief_summary>This study design discover mechanisms responsible decrease ( high ) blood pressure start daily hemodialysis , observe various investigator . We hypothesize good control body water sodium content decline autonomic ( sympathetic ) nervous system activity , increase chronic renal failure patient , would contribute improved blood pressure regulation . Moreover , studied effect daily hemodialysis mental function , like information processing memory , relation previously report improvement quality life , effect nutrition . We hypothesize would improve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Daily Home Hemodialysis Circulation , Mental Functions , Quality Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although conventional hemodialysis face many technical improvement recent year , great deal end-stage renal disease patient , treat modality , suboptimal high blood pressure , suffer poor quality life . Daily hemodialysis report improve , pathophysiological background poorly understood . Patients study 6 month daily ( i.e.6 time week ) home hemodialysis , two month conventional ( i.e . thrice weekly ) hemodialysis . We measure effect daily dialysis ( compare conventional dialysis ) blood pressure , cardiac output , extracellular fluid volume , plasma renin activity , sympathetic nervous system activity ( MSNA ) , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , neurocognitive functioning ( speed information processing , memory , executive functioning , attention ) , quality life , nutritional status</detailed_description>
