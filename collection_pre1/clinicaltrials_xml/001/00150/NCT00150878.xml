	<brief_title>Standard vs. Reduced-Intensity Conditioning Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia First Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transplant-related death extramedullary toxicity graft-versus host disease remain major cause treatment-failure patient AMl receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . In phase II study , M . Stelljes coworkers could show , reduce dose total-body- irradiation fludarabine safely use patient AML various disease stage . The best result could achieve patient complete remission time inclusion . Therefore prospective trial initiate compare new condition regimen standard regimen 12 Gy TBI/Cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg patient ith AML first remission . After achieve complete remission , give informed consent , patient stratify accord marrow cytogenetics , age type induction therapy subsequently randomize receive mention condition therapy . The primary end-point non-relapse mortality . The hypothesis would , one-year mortality reduce 25 15 % . Given power 0.8 first-error 5 % , 252 patient randomize . Secondary endpoint include : 3 year overall-and disease-free survival Rate grade II-IV acute GvHD Rate grade 3-4 extramedullary toxicity</detailed_description>
