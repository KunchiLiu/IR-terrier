	<brief_summary>This research design address question , `` Does relative deficit vaccine immunogenicity extremely premature infant persist beyond first 6 month life ? '' We propose measure immunogenicity varicella mumps-measles-rubella vaccine relatively healthy , 12-to-15 month-old child bear &lt; 29 week gestation , compare full-term infant , measure relevant viral serology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title : MMR Varicella Vaccine Responses Extremely Premature Infants Phase : IV Population : 16 generally healthy premature infant bear &lt; 29 week ' gestation , &lt; 16 month old Rochester area 16 generally healthy full-term infant bear &gt; /= 37 week ' gestation , &lt; 16 month old Rochester area Number Sites : University Rochester Study Duration : 1.5 - 8.5 month Description Agent Intervention : Subjects make 2 study visit . The first , 15 month age , coincide routine well child visit . Subjects 2 mL blood drawn time routine , 15-month MMR , varicella , pneumococcal conjugate immunization . At second study visit 4-6 week later , another 2 mL blood drawn . Objectives : Primary : We propose measure immunogenicity routinely administer varicella mumps-measles-rubella vaccine relatively healthy , 12-to-15 month-old child bear &lt; 29 week gestation ( premature ) , compare full-term infant . Measles titer measure neutralization assay . Mumps rubella titer measure enzyme-linked florescent immunoassay . Varicella titer measure enzyme link immunosorbent assay . Safety assess parental recall vaccine-related adverse event active , prospective collection blood-draw-associated adverse event . Schematic Study Design : Subjects approach 9-12 month age inclusion , consent time Visit 1 Visit 1 ( 15 mo ) : Preterm N = 16 , Full term N = 16 , 2 ml blood draw Routine MMR , varicella vaccine administer primary pediatrician per standard care ( Visit 1 ) Visit 2 ( 16 mo ) : Preterm N = 16 , Full term N = 16 , 2 ml blood draw Varicella , mumps , measles rubella vaccine titer measure ELISA</detailed_description>
