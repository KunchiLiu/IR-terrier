	<detailed_description>This study evaluate long-term outcome woman randomize trial compare accelerated whole breast irradiation ( 42.5 Gy 16 fraction 22 day ) longer conventional schedule whole breast irradiation ( 50 Gy 25 fraction 35 day ) follow breast-conserving surgery . The result report 5 year demonstrate equivalence two different radiation schedule effect local recurrence breast cosmetic outcome . Emerging data suggest accelerated short radiation schedule may potentially associate increased risk late morbidity skin , soft tissue heart 10 year beyond . The purpose study evaluate long term outcome woman randomize trial . The outcome evaluate include cosmetic outcome cardiac disease measure late radiation morbidity local breast recurrence measure effectiveness .</detailed_description>
