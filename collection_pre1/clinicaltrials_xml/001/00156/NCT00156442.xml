	<brief_title>A Study Examine Relationship Between Sleep Apnea Cleft Lip/Palate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea closely associate measurable , impaired cognitive function among otherwise neurologically normal , healthy child . In addition , least one recent study report mild hyperactive-impulsive symptom among child sleep disorder breathing . Cleft lip cleft palate comprise fourth common birth defect affect 1 700 newborn . Despite surgical repair , nearly one four child surgically repair cleft palate significant velopharyngeal dysfunction . Velopharyngeal closure expect nearly sounds English language . As result , incompetence result significant speech disability . Because hypernasal speech pattern functionally disable hyponasality , surgeon tend err side over-closure nasopharynx effort improve intelligibility child 's speech performing secondary speech procedure . Thus , surgical speech procedure well know result clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea . Unfortunately , data exists impact obstructive sleep apnea neurocognitive function child cleave palate raise possibility surgical intervention aim improve speech may result neurocognitive disability due obstructive sleep apnea . Furthermore , data exists guide surgeon relative impact poor speech versus sleep apnea global neurocognitive academic functioning . We therefore hypothesize unrecognized obstructive sleep apnea occur patient surgically repair cleft palate result demonstrable neurobehavioral sequela . In order address hypothesis , propose follow specific aim : Specific Aim # 1 : Describe incidence severity obstructive sleep apnea unselected population grade school age child surgically repair cleft palate . A . Is incidence OSA high child cleave palate age match historical control group ? B . Are nighttime symptom adequate screen tool exclude diagnosis OSA child surgically repair cleft palate ? Detailed measurement respiratory disturbance sleep affect gas exchange sleep state continuity perform via polysomnography . Comparisons make snore non-snoring group . Additional comparison make literature appropriate . Although sleep disorder breathe well know occur increase frequency child craniofacial anomaly , specific incidence child cleave palate remain unknown . Whether snore prof adequate screen tool child cleave palate also remain proven . We hypothesize sleep apnea affect gas exchange sleep state continuity identify presence absence habitual snoring . Specific Aim # 2 : Describe velopharyngeal closure pattern speech unselected population grade school age child surgically repair cleft palate . Detailed measurement nasal acoustic energy reading define passage perform . Measured nasalance compare assessment train speech pathologist . Presence substitution consonant valved level glottis oral pharynx , common feature misarticulations develop speech acquire presence velopharyngeal dysfunction note . In keep published literature , hypothesize measure nasometry correlate closely speech pathologist assessment nasality . Furthermore , hypothesize misarticulations note prominently child velopharyngeal dysfunction . Specific Aim # 3 : Describe neurobehavioral phenotype unselected population grade school age child surgically repair cleft palate . Detailed assessment neurobehavior perform use Behavior Rating Inventory Executive Function ( BRIEF ) , Parent &amp; Teacher Forms Conners ' Parent Rating Scale-Revised/Conners ' Teacher Rating Scale ( CPRS/CTRS ) . These questionnaire , specifically test executive function behavioral/emotional problem respectively , select behavior think affected OSA . Comparisons make normative data literature appropriate . Cleft palate carry significant long-term medical , dental , educational psychological burden affect . We therefore hypothesize significant neurobehavioral abnormality identify child surgically repair cleft palate</detailed_description>
