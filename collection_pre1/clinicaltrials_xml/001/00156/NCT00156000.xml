	<brief_summary>Among woman twin pregnancy , currently enrol study receive weekly injection 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate verse placebo injection , fetal fibronectin ( fFN ) salivary estriol ( E3 ) identify follow . 1 . Women increase risk preterm delivery . 2 . A subpopulation , among receive active drug , may respond progesterone . If fFN and/or E3 identify population patient respond progesterone , diagnostic test may define woman may may good candidate progesterone therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preterm birth occur approximately 12 % pregnancy United States lead cause neonatal morbidity mortality . Despite extensive effort preterm birth rate rise 25 % United States last two decade . Women multi-fetal pregnancy especially high risk preterm birth . About half twin pregnancy almost triplet pregnancy result preterm birth . Thus , woman multi-fetal gestation appear group would benefit screen intervention determine pregnancy greatest risk preterm birth . Currently , two biochemical , diagnostic test preterm birth approve FDA : fetal fibronectin salivary estriol testing . Recent study show weekly administration 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone significantly reduce preterm delivery singleton pregnancy . The propose study assist assessment woman benefit progesterone injection clarify 's mechanism action evaluation serial fFN E3 sample subset woman currently enrol multi-center trial evaluate 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate twin triplet pregnancy . This prospective observational study follow result serial fetal fibronectin salivary estriol sample subpopulation woman twin pregnancy currently enrol primary trial weekly injection 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate versus placebo injection . Subjects recruit large perinatology practice consist four outpatient clinic Phoenix metropolitan area .</detailed_description>
