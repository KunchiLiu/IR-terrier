Ongoing clinical experience discussion present former radiation patient reveals skin irritation , breakdown , pain associated suffering common side-effects patient wish experience . The lack effective , efficient , non-pharmacological treatment reduce symptom associate cutaneous skin reaction radiation cancer therapy problematic . Study Objectives overall aim study determine biologically active A. barbadensis therapeutic agent reduction cutaneous side effect woman experience result undergo radiation therapy breast cancer.The primary aim determine significant reduction increase cutaneous skin reaction use A. barbadensis irradiate skin breast chest wall comparison follow standard CCI non-pharmacological treatment protocol comparison use moist inert vehicle gel irradiate site.The secondary aim explore reduction increase subjective symptom irradiate site use A. barbadensis comparison follow standard CCI 'best care ' non-pharmacological treatment protocol comparison use moist inert vehicle gel irradiate site.MethodThis study single blind randomize control trial use three Arm design . Analysis stratification conduct accord radiation technique , breast size , smoker vs. non-smoker , nutrition , protocol adherence , prior chemotherapy . The control arm treat skin reaction per standard CCI breast radiation protocol</detailed_description>
