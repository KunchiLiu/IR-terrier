	<detailed_description>The combination congestive heart failure atrial fibrillation common co morbidity , although exact prevalence AF heart failure population still unclear . Recent study show prevalence AF range 10 % 50 % , although type AF observe investigated study always clearly describe . A number mechanism attribute congestive heart failure may contribute development AF Experimental congestive heart failure promotes sustain AF ionic remodel increased interstitial fibrosis . In contrast tachycardia-mediated AF , congestive heart failure shorten atrial refractoriness occurs . Atrial tissue stress cause congestive heart failure may also contribute promotion AF inducing trigger activity , affect atrial refractoriness property result increased tissue mass support re-entry [ 31 ] . Existence mechanisms suggest treatment congestive heart failure may also influence development progression AF patient . Conversion chronic AF observe patient congestive heart failure treat biventricular pace Ventricular ionic remodel likely underlies increase risk proarrhythmia heart failure patient expose antiarrhythmic drug , prolong action potential duration , therefore avoid patient congestive heart failure . The independent prognostic significance AF heart failure patient still completely clear . Results recent study suggest independent prognostic significance AF heart failure patient Result large study congestive heart failure suggest independent prognostic effect AF patient AF congestive heart failure , associate increase risk pump failure death all-cause mortality significantly reduce 1-year survival high mortality among heart failure patient develop AF A recent review regard mortality study congestive heart failure suggest concomitant AF additional effect mortality patient severe heart failure , increase mortality set mild-to-moderate heart failure This observation may attribute fact atrial contribution leave ventricular filling limited patient severe diastolic dysfunction , whereas atrial contribution may still hemodynamic importance mild-to-moderate heart failure</detailed_description>
