	<detailed_description>This exploratory study design evaluate incidence , quantify sleep disordered breathing follow stage I Norwood reconstructive surgery . Sleep disorder breathe correlate : 1 . Elevations pulmonary vasculature resistance time Stage II surgery . 2 . Risks death Children single ventricle physiology exquisitely sensitive alteration pulmonary vascular resistance . Following first operative repair ( stage I Norwood ) , perform first week life , pulmonary systemic circulation parallel rather series . As , elevation pulmonary vascular resistance result severe arterial desaturation . Additionally , elevate pre-operative pulmonary artery pressure directly correlate poor survival follow third final operative repair ( stage III Norwood , Fontan ) . Periodic breathe normal breathing pattern sleep infant . At end spectrum sleep apnea . In lie continuum sleep disorder breathing . Obstructive sleep apnea incidence approximately 2 % child , associate pulmonary systemic hypertension . Specific study incidence effect sleep disordered breathing congenital heart disease lack . Otherwise normal child baseline oxygen saturation high 90 's , thereby place flat part oxyhemoglobin curve . But child cyanotic congenital heart disease live baseline oxygen saturation mid 70 's , exist steep part oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve . We hypothesize therefore patient increase risk hemodynamic variation occur apneas/hypopneas even subtle , namely sleep disorder breathing . We hypothesize child complete stage I Norwood experience significant arterial desaturations sleep associate apneic event ( due concurrent elevation pulmonary arterial pressure ) normal counterpart . Additionally hypothesize child experience frequent apneic event sleep elevate pre-operative pulmonary artery pressure therefore bad outcome follow stage II Norwood . Thus , speculate child complete stage I Norwood prone risk sleep disordered breathing . Autonomic regulation , mediate part aortic arch baroreceptor , undoubtedly disrupt extensive surgical reconstruction require aortic arch stage I Norwood palliation . Adults child severe sleep disorder breathing ( obstructive sleep apnea ) impair cardiac autonomic control , increase cardiac electrical instability , great occurrence ventricular arrhythmia . Apneic event place hypoxic , mechanical adrenergic load cardiovascular system thereby directly result ventricular dysrhythmias . Observed late death follow stage I Norwood usually postulate secondary fatal arrhythmia . Thus , hypothesize child experience frequent apneic event sleep increase risk interstage mortality . Sleep disorder breathe readily treatable condition pediatric population . Non-invasive , continuous positive airway pressure apply via nasal mask effective treat sleep disorder breathing infant . Thus , sleep disorder breathe identify , effective treatment available may reduce risk inter-stage mortality adverse hemodynamics medically fragile population .</detailed_description>
