	<detailed_description>III . Hypothesis : The primary hypothesis pilot study dependence prevent adolescent smoke , yet dependent . With study , seek develop test feasibility provide control comparison two brief smoke dependence-prevention intervention . Additional analysis conduct determine , , demographic , psychological , personality , behavioral , family characteristic predict adolescent respond best dependence-prevention intervention , though clear priori prediction make . IV . Specific Aims : The primary aim pilot study prevent dependence adolescent smoker , great risk nicotine dependence tobacco-related disease . Nicotine dependence disease begin child adolescent : approximately three quarter adult tobacco user ( i.e. , cigarette cigar smoker user smokeless tobacco , SLT ) report first tobacco use occur 11-17 year old ( USDHHS , 1994a ; 1994b ; Riley et al. , 1996 ) . Moreover , early person start smoking , high eventual daily cigarette consumption ( Taoli Wydner , 1991 ) , great risk die smoking-related disease ( USDHHS , 1989 ) . Because smoke begin adolescent young tobacco user greatest risk progress dependence die smoking-related disease , adolescent smoker would benefit immensely effective tobacco dependence prevention . VI . Preliminary Progress/Data Report : This project involve evaluation phase , include laboratory measurement tobacco 's effect , dependence-prevention phase , follow-up phase . Because laboratory measurement critical success phase ( data generate laboratory phase use intervention thus influence follow-up ) , preliminary data section focus laboratory research . The Clinical Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory ( CBPL ; T. Eissenberg , Director ) site safe ethical study tobacco use adult ( e.g. , Eissenberg et al. , 1999 ; Buchhalter Eissenberg , 2000 ; Buchhalter et al. , 2001 ; Breland et al. , press ) . In addition , Dr. Eissenberg initiate discussion conduct safe ethical tobacco research adolescent : 2000 , plan chaired symposium entitle `` Ethical Practical Challenges Tobacco Research Children '' 6th Annual Meeting Society Research Nicotine Tobacco ( Eissenberg , 2000 ; see also Eissenberg Balster , 2002 ) . He also involve several laboratory study involve young adult ( e.g. , Gire Eissenberg , 2001 ) adolescent ( Zack et al. , 2001 ; Corrigall et al. , 2000 ) . Progress current project include establishment maintenance adolescent clinical lab facility direct observation young smoker test brief-intervention strategy control setting ; recruitment scientific clinical staff ; development subject recruitment procedure ; engagement local school personnel recruit process , utilization advertising city bus aid recruitment , development pilot test brief intervention ; successful completion 17 subject baseline lab session 8 telephone follow-at 1 month , 3 3 month , 1 visit 6 month , 1 phone contact 9 month , 1 visit 12 month . Four participant lose follow-up . VII . Research Method Design : This pilot protocol include several integrated component : recruitment , telephone in-person screening Parental Information Sheet assent , psychosocial assessment , laboratory assessment , two different dependence-prevention intervention , follow-up component . The evaluation dependence-prevention phase occur single 3- 4-hour session , 30-45 minute follow-up session take place approximately one month , three month , six month , one year completion evaluation dependence prevention phase . Each phase outline . Recruitment phase . Potential participant recruit print ad , attach protocol IRB review , may distribute school school permission . Along ad , student receive parental information assent procedure , therefore parent inform study directly adolescent . The parental information sheet would explain teenager interested part study prevention tobacco dependence . It give brief description study . Parent signatures indicate receive information . For adolescent find study flier word mouth , parental information sheet send mail . Flyers may also distribute willing adolescent . Interested peer may call see eligible , qualify come baseline phase send referral fee five dollar original participant referral . Even original participant receive referral fee , name participant divulge . Screening , consent , assent phase . Potential participant initially screen use screen interview . Screenings might occur via telephone person , depend upon individual preference . The sole purpose screen interview determine interested adolescent meet study inclusion/exclusion criterion ( see ) . The screen interview collect minimum amount information need determine eligibility maintain potential participant 's anonymity . This information collect ( background data , ) determine reliability reporting . Individuals unable report smoke history reliably ineligible participation . Following initial screen process , potential participant tell parents/legal guardian need sign date parental information assent procedure . The parental information assent procedure explain teenager interested part study look prevention become addict smoker give brief description study . Individuals much time need consider child 's participation . The child bring parental sign form first laboratory session . If parent want bring adolescent still pay compensate time , however require . Adolescent assent do prior research collection initial study session . A researcher complete VCU 's Level I IRB train read attach assent form adolescent answer question individual may . Individuals much time need consider participation . Individuals interested participate ask sign assent form indicate agree participate understand may stop participate time . Psychosocial Assessment . Adolescent participant ask complete demographic , psychological , personality , behavioral , family questionnaire . The baseline questionnaires consist Child Depression Inventory ( Kovacs , 1982 ) , Revised Children 's Manifest Anxiety Scale ( Reynolds &amp; Richmond , 1978 ) , Leyton Obsessional Inventory - Child Version ( Berg , Rapoport , &amp; Flament , 1987 ) , Barkley 's ADHD Scale ( Barkely , 1998 ) , National Youth Survey Conduct Scale ( Elliot , Huizinga , &amp; Morse , 1988 ) , Adolescent Life Events Inventory ( Compas , et . al. , 1987 ) , Family Assessment Device ( Epstein , Baldwin , &amp; Bishop , 1983 ) , Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory ( Millon , Green , &amp; Meagher , 1982 ) , question pertain body image , substance use , smoke behavior attitude . Each questionnaire develop specifically use child and/or adolescent , standardize widely use general adolescent population . These data use report participant characteristic especially useful identify factor predict intervention response . We recognize ask personal question sometimes make people feel uncomfortable . Participants instructed question upset , tell researcher . The researcher inform clinician evaluate participant determine recommend necessary service . Laboratory Assessment : The laboratory assessment virtually identical report elsewhere ( e.g. , Corrigall et al. , 2001 ) involve approximately 20 minute rest period , questionnaire relate tobacco withdrawal tobacco/nicotine effect , ad lib smoke use mouthpiece measure puff topography ( e.g. , puff volume , number , duration , etc ) , variety physiological measure . Only adolescents already smoke eligible ; therefore , believe smoke single cigarette lab confers additional risk . During rest period , participant complete demographic background information questionnaire . Participants ask smoke normally would , constraint . Participants provide cigarette ( one ) cigarette provide . Outcome measure , describe , include physiological data ( e.g. , heart rate , breath carbon monoxide level , etc ) , subjective report tobacco withdrawal symptom , puff topography . Saliva sample take smoking later measurement salivary nicotine cotinine ( nicotine metabolite ) . Questionnaires : All questionnaire computerize . Withdrawal-related questionnaire include QSU-Brief ( Cox et al. , 2001 ) MNWS ( Hughes Hatsukami , 1986 ) . The Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence ass dependence level ( FTND ; Heatherton , Kozlowski , Frecker , &amp; Fagerstrom , 1991 ) . Subjective effect smoke also assess . Physiological Measures . Two physiological measure monitor continuously : heart rate ( every 20 second ) blood pressure ( every 3 minute ; Noninvasive Patient Monitor model 507E , Criticare Systems , Waukesha , WI ) . Expired CO level measure screen smoke use BreathCO monitor ( Vitalagraph , Lenaxa , KS ) . This equipment procedure use extensively study VCU ( e.g. , Buchhalter et al. , 2001 ; Breland et al. , press ) . In addition , salivary nicotine cotinine collect smoking . Participants ask chew roll cotton place plastic test tube . The test tube store freezer warmer -32 degree . Topography measure : Puff topography sensitive measure drug self-administration cigarette smoker use previous study adolescent smoker ( e.g. , Corrigall et al. , 2001 ) . Cigarettes smoke mouthpiece connect pressure transducer inhalation-induced pressure change amplify , digitize , sample rate 1000 Hz . Software ( Plowshare Technologies , Baltimore , MD ) convert signal air flow ( ml/sec ) integrate flow data , produce measure puff volume , duration , number , interpuff interval ( IPI ) . Dependence-Prevention Interventions : After psychosocial laboratory component , participant take 20-minute break snack drink provide . Participants assign randomly one two possible dependence-prevention group . The random assignment occur evaluation phase , bias experimenter data collection . One dependence-prevention group involve brief motivational interview provide general personalize feedback immediate long-term consequence smoking , include feedback physiological psychological impact tobacco measure evaluation phase . Motivational interview promise intervention adolescent smoker ( Colby , et . al. , 1998 ; Lawendowski , 1998 ) . The second group receive brief education-based dependence-prevention intervention . Research indicate high proportion adolescent , particularly smoker , unaware many significant smoking-related health risk , include shorten lifespan likelihood die smoking-related death ( Romer &amp; Jamieson , 2000 ) . In addition , perceive health risk predict motivation quit , suggest adolescent well inform smoking-related health problem may motivate stop smoking ( Romer &amp; Jamieson , 2000 ) . The second group watch composite anti-smoking video , include education regard immediate long-term effect smoke education regard tobacco company market strategy . All participant earn $ 40 mall gift certificate completion phase . Follow-up phase : Brief telephone follow-up session take place approximately one month , three month , six month , nine month completion dependence-prevention intervention . The telephone follow-ups consist brief time-line follow-back questionnaire ass smoke behavior past two week . Participants earn $ 10 mall gift certificate completion telephone follow-up mail completion follow-up session . In addition , short follow-up check-ups perform six month one year completion dependence-prevention intervention . During two follow-up check-ups , participant complete time-line follow-back questionnaire , addition question current smoke attitude . Non-intrusive physiological data record validate report . Physiological data collection consist obtain salivary nicotine cotinine expire CO level , use procedure describe . Participants earn $ 25 mall gift certificate completion follow-up check-up session . If parent / legal guardian bring adolescent , compensate $ 30 follow-up check-up session . VIII . Statistical Analysis : Data Analysis . Data analysis include : Descriptive Statistics . Means , standard deviation , range , skewness , kurtosis measure examine determine outlier normality data . In addition , correlation run measure determine significant relationship exist questionnaire physiological data . Inferential Statistics . Regarding data evaluation condition , examine relationship questionnaire data physiological data . Regarding follow-up data , run two-way mixed ANOVAs examine effect dependence-prevention intervention smoke follow-up . In addition , run regression use questionnaire physiological data predictor smoke behavior follow-up . IX . Human Subjects Instructions : A . Description . A total 40 adolescent smoking volunteer need complete preliminary research protocol . All session take place Clinical Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory Virginia Commonwealth University 's medical campus . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria : Participants must healthy , age 12 18 year age , current smoker ( define least one cigarette last week , accord participant self-report ) . In order ensure smoker yet dependent , adolescent smoke 10 cigarette per day day last week exclude . Other exclusionary criterion include : history current specific health concern , include cardiovascular disease , pregnancy current breast feeding . C. Recruitment Plan . Participants recruit print advertisement , may distribute local school . Parental information form distribute mailed upon contact adolescent . Participants call CBPL potential participant participate telephone screen describe . If participant eligible participation , qualify laboratory staff member complete VCU 's Level One IRB Training obtain assent adolescent begin initial session . Potential participant give opportunity ask question assent process afford time need make informed decision . Assent form attach IRB review . G. Compensation Plan .
