	<brief_summary>It know patient aortic stenosis , include undergoing cardiac surgery problem , prone develop bleed problem , particularly gastrointestinal tract . It believe shear stress associate blood flow abnormal aortic valve result abnormal hemostasis . Abnormalities include increased proteolysis von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) increase bind high molecular weight multimers vWF platelet membrane subsequent inappropriate platelet aggregation . Thus , appropriate aggregation circulate platelet impair . Cardiac surgery associate significant alteration hemostasis . Patients undergoing cardiac surgery consume significant percent available blood product throughout United States subject various numerous risk associate blood product transfusion . In addition , excessive postoperative bleeding common cause need surgically re-explore chest cavity patient undergone cardiac surgical procedure . Such additional surgery carry cost risk . Following surgical correction aortic valve stenotic pathology , associate vWF abnormality appear reverse . However , process take several day . Although cardiac surgical patient risk postoperative bleeding , patient undergo aortic valve surgery aortic stenosis may particularly risk postoperative complication . In addition , patient aortic valve stenosis undergo noncardiac surgery may predisposition bleed similar underlie shear stress induce abnormal vWF platelet function . The propose study trial evaluate effectiveness 2 different antifibrinolytic drug ameliorate hemostatic defect associate aortic stenosis . Aprotonin , antifibrinolytic agent also platelet preserve actions4 , compare currently use anti-fibrinolytic , epsilon aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study subject competent adult patient schedule undergo elective aortic valve surgery severe aortic stenosis . The process inform consent begin prior day surgery either patient 's preoperative surgery clinic visit one cardiac surgeon patient clinic visit preoperative anesthesia evaluation prior day surgery . At one time patient tell study give copy inform consent reading . An opportunity discus study time offer . Written inform consent obtain day surgery , prior surgery . Patients must also require coronary artery surgery take receive drug alter platelet function , include aspirin ( within past 2 week ) modern ADP receptor antagonist Plavix . As per current patient care guideline Strong Memorial Hospital , patient undergo first-time single valve , non-coronary artery surgical procedure randomize receive either epsilon aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) aprotonin intravenously . It anticipate 1-3 patient initially enrol pilot subject get study go smoothly 1-3 patient may complete test and/or data may inadequate . Therefore , although analysis use 40 subject protocol seek permission enroll maximum 24 subject per group total 48 patient . The test perform : 1. PFA-100 , platelet related hemostasis test high shear system test platelet function 2. von Willebrand antigen test , immunoassay 3. factor VIII coagulant activity test . 4 . Ristocetin cofactor activity test . 5. thromboelastography ( TEG ) , point-of-care test hemostatic function include measure platelet function . ( Reference range / coefficient variation / SD 's / test follow : vWF-Ag : 50 - 160 % normal activity / 2 - 5 % / ~5 % FVIII : 50 - 200 % normal / 4 - 7 % / ~5 % Ristocetin cofactor : 60-200 % normal / ~15 % / ~10 % PFA100 closure time : epinephrine &lt; 181 second ADP &lt; 112 second / ~12 % / 20 sec ) Total blood volume require patient purpose research related test approximately 30 ml ( 1 fluid ounce 2 tablespoon ) . 10 mls drawn patient 's arterial line , routinely place cardiac anesthesia &amp; surgery care , follow time point care : 1. prior induction anesthesia 2 . 5 minute load dose either EACA aprotonin administer prior administration heparin 3 . 15 minute administration protamine follow termination cardiopulmonary bypass . Thus , additional `` needle puncture '' necessary relate study . Each blood sample 10 ml divide one `` blue-top '' ( citrate ) tube ( 3 ml ) keep ice , one `` blue-top '' ( citrate ) tube ( 3 ml ) keep room temperature , remainder use perform TEG . IV . Data Analysis Monitoring : Statistical analysis perform use either 2-sample t-test Mann-Whitney Test , appropriate , compare two patient group three time point . A p-value le 0.05 consider significant . All test two-sided . With proposed sample size N = 20 two group , study least 80 % power yield statistically significant result . V. Data Storage Confidentiality : Data produce within SMH hematology lab store paper computer Department Anesthesiology back network drive . The principal investigator maintain information password protect file computer ( ) private office .</detailed_description>
