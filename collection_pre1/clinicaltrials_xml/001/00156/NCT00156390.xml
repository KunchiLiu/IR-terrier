	<brief_summary>Heart Failure ( HF ) disease epidemic proportion U.S. affect 5 million individual . It estimate next year nearly 400,000 new case diagnose , 1 million individual hospitalize 300,000 death occur HF . Approximately half death attribute worsen pump function remainder attributable sudden cardiac death . Biventricular ( BIV ) pace recently emerge exciting new treatment advance HF dramatic benefit patient . Current candidate include ventricular conduction abnormality reduce ejection fraction continue suffer severe HF symptom despite optimal pharmacological therapy . Recent clinical trial demonstrate BIV pace improves myocardial function , functional capacity , quality life , well reduce incidence hospitalization even prolong life . Despite , one third patient HF benefit BIV pacing , so-called 'non-responders ' . Our group others show direct genetic effect BiV pace animal model , however , gap exist knowledge effect leave ventricular ( LV ) pace site genetic influence degree response novel therapy . This proposal aim identify predictor benefit Biventricular ( BIV ) pace goal optimize degree benefit increase proportion patient respond therapy . Patients fulfill current indication BIV pace undergo echocardiography ( echo ) regional tissue Doppler analysis cardiac image consist myocardial perfusion imaging ( EGC rest gate Spect scan use Sestamibi ) prior implantation BIV pacing device . They randomly assign empiric versus echo Spect scan-guided LV lead positioning . In latter group , optimal LV pace site define site late peak tissue velocity tissue Doppler echo Spect scan testing . In empiric group , LV lead position choose mask operator base coronary sinus venous anatomy , electrocardiographic ( ECG ) criterion , per standard care . Blood would collect patient time procedure analysis genetic polymorphism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . To test hypothesis number , size , location , severity myocardial perfusion defect scar distribution dictate pattern LV dyssynchrony tissue Doppler echocardiography speckle track . An extensive body literature exist describe predictor response BIV pace HF patient . Our group others establish clear association presence mechanical cardiac dyssynchrony response BIV pacing . Also , group others examine effect defect myocardial perfusion imaging ( MIBI ) scan response BIV pacing . What remain unclear relationship number , size , distribution , severity perfusion defect pattern dyssynchrony echo . It seem plausible distribution scar and/or perfusion abnormality dictate pattern mechanical delay relative timing contraction various part LV . Approach : In first phase proposal , utilize technique available group correlate pattern perfusion defect pattern mechanical dyssynchrony . For purpose , patient clinical indication BIV pace undergo nuclear perfusion image rest well echocardiographic ( echo ) image tissue Doppler assessment speckle track . The site late mechanical activation pattern mechanical contraction compare site scar and/or perfusion defect rest MIBI scan . Anticipated Results : The purpose first phase proposal would identify dyssynchrony pattern downstream manifestation myocardial injury scheme therefore , predict base number , size , severity , distribution perfusion abnormality . 2 . To test hypothesis LV lead position away dense scar determine rest nuclear perfusion image close site late LV mechanical activation translates improve response BIV pacing . Our group others demonstrate improved acute hemodynamics long term response BIV pace LV lead position concordant site late mechanical activation LV . Also , group others show LV pace lead position site scar vicinity high scar density area associate little echocardiographic clinical response BIV pacing . To date , standard clinical practice continue consist place LV lead tip lateral posterior position . Maintaining approach cardiomyopathy patient regardless nature myocardial insult site scar may optimal may account lack response BIV therapy significant number patient . The primary objective specific aim demonstrate MIBI/echo-guided LV lead placement superior standard lead placement patient randomize MIBI/echo-guided arm exhibit great improvement symptom HF great improvement LV function 6-month interval compare patient receive standard LV lead placement . Approach : Heart failure patient ( n=210 ) enrol study randomly assign 2:1 fashion one two study arm :</detailed_description>
