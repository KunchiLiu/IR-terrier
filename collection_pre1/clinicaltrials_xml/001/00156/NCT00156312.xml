	<brief_title>Evaluation Tumor Factors Breast Cancer Treated With Docetaxel Capecitabine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some chemotherapy drug think work synergy , mean work well combination , rather singly one drug may cause change tumor make drug effective . The drug docetaxel capecitabine may work synergy , base laboratory study tumor . These laboratory study show docetaxel increase level critical enzyme , call thymidine phosphorylase ( TP ) , necessary activate capecitabine . This study use promise chemotherapy combination patient breast cancer . Before , , chemotherapy , participant ' breast tumor examine see TP increase , predict laboratory study . The study also look factor tumor blood may able predict effective chemotherapy individual , future may better select best chemotherapy individual 's cancer .</detailed_description>
