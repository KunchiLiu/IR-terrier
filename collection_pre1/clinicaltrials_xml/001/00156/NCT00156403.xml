	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Use Calcium Channel Blocker Decrease Inflammation Pain Hereditary Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hereditary Pancreatitis rare , autosomal dominantly inherit condition cause mutation cationic trypsinogen gene . These mutation lead excessive activation trypsinogen within pancreatic acinar cell subsequent pancreatic inflammation . Clinically , may observe recurrent acute pancreatitis , chronic pancreatitis , eventual complication exocrine endocrine pancreatic insufficiency pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Currently , specific treatment prophylactic measure condition . Calcium physiologic switch activate trypsinogen . It recently find mutation site affect tightly calcium bind trypsinogen , mutation lead excessive calcium bind subsequent excessive trypsinogen activation . This study obtain baseline data whether prophylactic use long-acting calcium channel blocker , amlodipine , would lead decrease inappropriate activation trypsinogen , thereby decrease subsequent pancreatic inflammation . Up 15 subject , age 6 year , mutation cationic trypsinogen gene ( PRSS1 ) recruit undergo 16-week trial . This include one-month baseline symptom assessment ( daily symptom diary ) blood pressure measurement ( automate home blood pressure monitor ) . Subsequently , subject place 2.5 - 10 mg amlodipine po qd ( wean wean phase ) approximately 10 week . They continue fill daily symptom diary , blood pressure measurement ( ensure decrease ) , fill periodic quality life questionnaire , undergo periodic blood test routine biochemistry well specialized test proteomics inflammatory cytokine analysis . The study three main purpose : determine whether use amlodipine appear safe patient population , determine frequently best follow subject take medication , determine whether indication potential benefit medication ( whether decrease symptom frequency/ severity inflammatory cytokine analysis ) . A subsequent large study would design base result .</detailed_description>
