	<brief_summary>This research do develop new treatment non-hodgkin 's lymphoma subject whose cancer return resist treatment chemotherapy . The investigational drug clofarabine use study . An investigational drug one approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine Relapsed Refractory T-Cell B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety profile clofarabine appear acceptable within target population study date clinical study , numerous response observe heavily pre-treated patient relapsed/refractory ALL AML . Dose escalation clofarabine patient solid tumor lymphoproliferative disorder limit grade 3 4 myelosuppression consider acceptable patient acute leukemia , provide hematologic recovery occur within 6 week therapy , dose escalation proceed high 40 mg/m2 patient population . Furthermore , response observe recent trial patient relapse CLL treat clofarabine 2 mg/m2 , indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder indicate low dos likely ineffective patient aggressive NHL . ( Personal Communication ILEX Products , INC. ) This Phase I/II study evaluate escalate dos clofarabine patient relapse refractory diffuse large cell B-cell NHL start dose 4 mg/m2/day 5 consecutive day repeat every 28 day maximum 6 cycle . This dose regimen evaluate patient population standard therapy relapse grade 3 4 myelosuppression frequently observe traditional NHL salvage . Additionally , patient receive granulocyte colony stimulate factor discretion investigator . Antifungal antibacterial prophylaxis administer minimize risk infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient least 18 year old histology confirm diffuse large cell Bcell NHL fail prior systemic chemotherapy without monoclonal antibodybased therapy . Measurable disease determine Ct PET scan bone marrow involvement , define lesion accurately measure two dimension CT PET scan long diameter accurately great equal 1.0 cm palpable lesion diameter great equal 2.0 cm . PET scan measurable disease define base SUV value determine nuclear medicine evaluation . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0,1 , 2 . Life expectancy great 12 week . Laboratory value obtain less equal 14 day prior registration : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1500 . White blood cell ( WBC ) count great 3.0 . Platelets great equal 100 . Hemoglobin ( HG ) great 9.0 g/dL . Total bilirubin less equal 2.0 mg/dL . Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) /alanine transaminase ( ALT ) less equal 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Higher value acceptable deem related liver involvement NHL . Serum creatinine less equal 2.0 mg/dL . Cardiac function pretreatment MUGA scan echocardiogram consider normal institutional standard . Capable understanding investigational nature , potential risk benefit study , able provide valid inform consent . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week prior enrollment . Male female patient must use effective contraceptive method study minium 6 month study treatment . Previously untreated NHL . Received previous treatment clofarabine . History Tcell lymphoma . Bulky disease ( ie , single mass great 10 cm circulate malignant cell great equal 24,000 cells/ul . Patients know AIDSrelated HIVpositive lymphoma . Autologous bone marrow stem cell transplant within 3 month study entry . History allogeneic bone marrow transplant organ transplant . Prior radiotherapy site measurable disease . Any medical condition require chronic use oral highdose corticosteroid . ( excess 1 mg/kg/day ) . Autoimmune thrombocytopenia . Use investigational agent within 30 day anticancer therapy within 3 week study entry . The patient must recover acute toxicity previous therapy . Patients active , uncontrolled systemic infection consider opportunistic , life threatening , clinically significant time treatment know suspected fungal infection ( ie , patient parenteral antifungal therapy ) . HIVpositive status . Active secondary malignancy . Pregnant lactating patient . Any significant concurrent disease , illness , psychiatric disorder would compromise patient safety compliance , interfere consent , study participation , followup , interpretation study result . Patients active untreated central nervous lymphoma ( CNS ) lymphoma .</criteria>
