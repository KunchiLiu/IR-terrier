	<brief_title>A Study Determine Levetiracetam Will Assist Those Suffering From Chronic Idiopathic Axonal Polyneuropathy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based literature expert opinion , despite effort make well treat spectrum neuropathic pain , still unmet need . The available treatment effective monotherapy administration vast majority patient polypharmacy several medication often necessary . Tricyclic antidepressant ( TCAs ) , mainly amitriptyline , still mainstay treatment painful peripheral neuropathy , risk dose-limiting adverse event , may reduce effectiveness . TCA treatment effect inconsistent limit side effect . In one clinical trial 50 % patient achieve significant complete relief pain 81 % experienced side effect 71 % side effect dose limit . TCAs produce sedation , urinary retention , orthostatic hypotension particular concern elderly patient cardiovascular disease . In study desipramine associate slightly low rate side effect offer 40 % patient significant complete relief neuropathic pain . Fluoxetine effective placebo pain relief . ( Max , 1992 ) . Due scarcity control clinical trial inconclusive result available trial , physician vary markedly suggest regimen neuropathic pain management . ( Beydoun , 1999 ) . Antiepileptic drug use frequently non-epileptic indication neuropathic pain . One mechanism neuropathic pain occurs relate increased excitability central neuron . Although precise mechanism action neuropathic pain remain unknown , antiepileptic drug believe exert antineuralgic activity suppress neuronal hyperexcitability state characterizes neuropathic pain . A small crossover trial carbamazepine produce clinical benefit significant number patient side effect somnolence 50 % , dizziness 40 % rash 6 % ( Rull , 1969 ) . Gabapentin show benefit placebo 165-subject randomize study painful diabetic neuropathy pain ; side effect note mild moderate 8 % withdrew due side effect ( Backonja , 1998 ) . In placebo control study lamotrigine diabetic neuropathy significant reduction daily pain score compare placebo ; side effect note half treat group minor . ( Eisenberg , 2001 ) . Results treatment trial sing valproate painful diabetic neuropathy variable positive ( Kochar , 2004 ) negative trial ( Otto , 2004 ) . Treatment neuropathic pain chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy receive limited study . In single open label study CIDP pain tiagabine produce 30 % reduction pain severity almost half patient discontinue trial ( Novak , 2001 ) . Levetiracetam test two animal model neuropathic pain ( Ardidd , 2001 ) . In streptozocin diabetic rat model , reactivity pressure paw assess revealed ED50 levetiracetam comparable one observe epilepsy model . Further , hyperalgesia dose-dependently decreased levetiracetam . On hand , mononeuropathic sciatic nerve ligature model , hyperalgesia significantly diminish . Carbamazepine effective sciatic nerve ligature model . Animal model neuropathic pain consider suggestive activity human directly predictive . Based data animal study neuropathic pain model , levetiracetam test limited basis two human type neurological pain , painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy sural nerve stimulation healthy volunteer . The diabetic neuropathy study 12-week , multicenter , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel group study evaluate efficacy safety flexible dose LEV 500 1500 mg bid . A total 105 subject include ITT population , 52 subject placebo 53 subject LEV group . At baseline , treatment group comparable respect demographic baseline characteristic . There statistically significant clinically meaningful treatment difference observe throughout evaluation period relative baseline ( personal communication ) . In randomized , double-blind , crossover , electrical sural nerve stimulation study , pain assess healthy volunteer 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 24 hour 1500 mg levetiracetam placebo orally administer . Levetiracetam significantly increase threshold pain detection single electrical sural nerve stimulation use , effect temporal pain summation repetitive sural nerve stimulation ( CDC ) . It , however , demonstrate result one type neuropathic pain necessarily extrapolate type , negative result 1998 study amitriptyline HIV-related painful neuropathy demonstrates ( Beydoun , 1999 ) . A small , investigator-initiated open label trial use levetiracetam postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) recently complete . The study , publish Neurology , report 6/10 patient improvement PHN symptomatology 12-week treatment levetiracetam . All 10 patient expose received multiple prior treatment PHN ( Rowbotham , 2003 ) .</detailed_description>
