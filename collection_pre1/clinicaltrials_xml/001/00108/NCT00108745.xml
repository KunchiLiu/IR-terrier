	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study paclitaxel see well work compare polyglutamate paclitaxel observation treat patient stage III stage IV ovarian epithelial , peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel polyglutamate paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Paclitaxel polyglutamate paclitaxel may also stop growth ovarian epithelial peritoneal cancer block blood flow tumor . Sometimes , treatment , tumor may need additional treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . It yet know whether paclitaxel effective polyglutamate paclitaxel observation treat ovarian epithelial , peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether CT-2103 ( polyglutamate paclitaxel ) paclitaxel , administer woman advance ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer attain clinically-defined complete response primary platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy ( `` consolidation/maintenance therapy '' ) reduce death rate , compare re-treatment time document disease progression . II . To determine , clinical setting , CT-2103 produce favorable toxicity profile ( particular focus peripheral neuropathy measure Gynecologic Oncology Group [ GOG ] NTX4 ) superior quality-of-life ( measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Ovarian [ FACT-O ] ) , compare paclitaxel . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore relationship expression several angiogenic marker overall survival progression-free survival patient randomize CT-2103 , paclitaxel , treatment . II . To assess association among various tissue serum marker angiogenesis , compare ability different combination marker predict patient outcome include overall survival progression-free survival patient randomize CT-2103 , paclitaxel , treatment . III . To bank deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) whole blood research evaluate association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) measure clinical outcome include overall survival , progression-free survival adverse event . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive polyglutamate paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 10-20 minute day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . ARM III : Patients receive anticancer treatment evidence disease progression . In arm I II , treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 10 year .</detailed_description>
