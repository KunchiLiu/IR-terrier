	<brief_summary>This study compare effectiveness unilateral versus bilateral exercise training recover movement ability chronic stroke patient . After stroke , people improve movement ability exercise arm affect stroke . Others improve exercise arm together . This study compare two kind exercise see might work best . Healthy volunteer people stroke 6 month ago may eligible study . Stroke patient must weakness stroke-affected arm . All participant must 18 year age old . Candidates screen clinical neurological examination . Women become pregnant pregnancy test . Stroke patient magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study brain one last year . Participants undergo follow test procedure : MRI : This procedure use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . The subject lie table slide scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock sound occur scan process . The procedure last 45 minute , time subject must lie still 30 minute . Testing session : There six test session - two familiarize subject reach test , two reach test plus transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) exercise session , two reach test plus TMS one day exercise session . The session consecutive day , 1-week break session 3 . The procedure involve : - Reaching test : The subject responds quickly possible `` GO '' signal present computer monitor perform reach movement arm . The activity arm muscle record use surface electrode . During test , questionnaire use determine subject 's attention , fatigue , mood . - TMS : For test , wire coil hold scalp , brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg , subject may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . The effect TMS muscle detect small metal disk electrode tap onto skin arm . The subject perform reach test TMS deliver various time get `` GO '' signal . - Arm exercise : The subject seat front exercise device two handle slide forward backward along set track . The subject ask slide either one handle back forth repeatedly , alternate 5 minute arm exercise 5 minute rest 30 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : It propose individual stroke may benefit great degree training arm simultaneously train paretic arm alone . The purpose protocol identify extent mechanism paretic arm performance improvement single session bilateral arm training compare single session unilateral paretic arm training individual moderate-severity chronic stroke . Study population : The study population consist individual chronic stroke . Design : A single-blinded , counterbalance , crossover design use . Outcome measure : Endpoint measure include paretic arm peak acceleration disinhibition stroke-affected cortical hemisphere measure transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) context reach task . These measure compare unilateral vs. bilateral arm training session individual chronic stroke .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals Chronic Stroke ( n=40 ) : We include individual least 6 month post thromboembolic nonhemorrhagic hemispheric hemorrhagic hemispheric lesion . We select individual initially severe hemiparesis recover point moderate motor impairment . Individuals moderate motor impairment define FuglMeyer score least 30 , inability actively extend paretic wrist finger least 20 degree . Assessment severity initial hemiparesis take either patient report medical record . We would also like study small group ( n=10 ) individual mild motor impairment due stroke . Individuals mild motor impairment define Upper Extremity FuglMeyer score 50 great ( maximum score = 66 ) , ability actively extend paretic wrist finger 20 degree . We also enroll 10 healthy volunteer . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Volunteers : History alcohol drug abuse psychiatric illness , include depression . History neurological disorder disease , include epilepsy . History orthopedic injury disorder affect upper extremity . Less 18 year age . Have pacemaker , implant pump stimulators , metal object inside eye skull . Individuals Chronic Stroke ( Moderate Mild Impairment Groups ) : Unable perform task ( rapid forward reach task ) affect arm . History alcohol drug abuse psychiatric illness , History neurological disorder disease , include epilepsy . History orthopedic injury disorder affect upper extremity . Less 18 year age . Cerebellar brainstem lesion . Severe uncontrolled medical problem ( e.g . cardiovascular disease , severe rheumatoid arthritis , arthritic joint deformity , active cancer renal disease ) . Taking medication act primarily central nervous system . Pregnancy MRI perform within past 6 month therefore need attain . Serious cognitive deficit ( define equivalent minimental state exam score 23 less ) would prevent ability give inform consent and/or perform study task . Have pacemaker , implant pump stimulators , metal object inside eye skull .</criteria>
