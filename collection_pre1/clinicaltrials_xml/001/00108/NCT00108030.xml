	<brief_summary>The specific aim project improve walk ability person follow stroke use 'treadmill train plus power training ' . This modality address two major impairment following stroke : weakness incoordination , well loss fitness . Importantly , train present high intensity great volume currently receive . Furthermore , ensure person continue maintain level improvement intensive exercise program , also implement behavioral change long-term maintenance exercise behavior less supervised environment . A randomized controlled clinical trial conduct 102 sub-acute stroke patient ascertain efficacy approach improve walk ability . Hypotheses : 1 . Walking endurance increase great degree patient group receive treadmill plus muscle power training compare treadmill train group , 'usual care ' group . 2 . Gait stability , muscle function , aerobic fitness balance improve group receive treadmill plus muscle power training , either treadmill train usual care patient group . 3 . Habitual activity level higher group receive treadmill plus muscle power training compare treadmill train group 'usual care ' group . 4 . The change 6-minute walk distance positively related change muscle power , strength endurance , aerobic fitness , gait mechanic , balance . 5 . Baseline depression low self-efficacy associate less robust adaptation type train low rate long-term compliance exercise prescription experimental group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PBWST ( Partial Body-Weight Supported Treadmill Training ) Muscle Power Training After Sub-acute Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine treatment efficacy , single blind , randomize control trial conduct . One hundred two subject randomly allocate one three group comprise : ( ) `` Treadmill train + Power training '' ( TT+POWER ) , ( ii ) `` Treadmill training '' ( TT ) , ( iii ) `` Usual Care '' ( USUAL ) . Those TT+POWER TT also receive 'usual care ' . Subjects recruit within week two follow stroke , time would expect medically stable . Subjects train group attend train 10 week , 3 time per week . Following ten-week train program , subject give home-based training package follow 6 month . Interventions : Treadmill Training : The emphasis weight-supported treadmill train program initially emphasize walk alignment . The amount support reduce quickly possible attain full weight-bearing motorize treadmill . Once subject attain full weight-bearing correct segmental alignment , emphasis improve aerobic fitness whilst maintain proper walk alignment . Treadmill Training + Power Training : Subjects undertake 30 min treadmill training , describe , follow 30 min power training use pneumatic resistance equipment ( Keiser Sports Health , Inc. , Fresco , CA , USA ) ( leg press , knee extension flexion , hip abduction , plantarflexion ) . Standard principle govern frequency , volume , duration , intensity exercise know provide maximal adaptation healthy frail adult follow . Legs train unilaterally . Home-based program : Following 10 week training , subject give home-based training program continue indefinitely . Subjects TT+Power group give weight instruction use , walk program whereas TT group give walk program . To encourage compliance program , subject telephone weekly , visited monthly . Subjects also request fill weekly log sheet detail exercise session physical activity , mail trainer feedback week . Outcomes : Outcomes measure prior commencement training , 10 week training , 6-months home base exercise . The Primary outcome distance walk 6-min . This test select walk distance important criterion community ambulation . It relate functional impairment well strength lower limb muscle aerobic fitness , avoids problem gait velocity relevant short-distance ambulation , robust measurement . Secondary Outcomes : 1 . Other walk variable balance variable : The total number step take waking hour , use accelerometer large capacity data logger . Temporal spatial variable associate walking , well balance assess . 2 . Lower limb muscular strength , power endurance assess use pneumatic resistance machine . 3 . Cardiorespiratory fitness assess variable collect maximal effort cycle test multistage exercise test . 4 . Scales questionnaires provide assessment change subject 's psychological functional state . Scales include stroke impact scale , self-efficacy scale , health relate qualify life questionnaire , geriatric depression scale .</detailed_description>
