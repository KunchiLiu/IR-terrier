	<detailed_description>In old ( 65 year age old ) patient congestive heart failure , propose : 1 . Assess : ) Peak aerobic capacity ( peak VO2 ) monitor , standardize treadmill test ; b ) Oxygen uptake kinetics heart rate standardize submaximal treadmill test ; c ) Performance set functional mobility task ; ) Self-report physical disability difficulty perform daily task , physical activity . 2 . Conduct 12-week randomize controlled trial , compare change assess measure patient randomize three different group : 1 ) standard cardiac rehabilitation use bicycle exercise ; 2 ) group functional circuit training focus exercise involve functional mobility task home-activities exercise component ; 3 ) chair-based , flexibility `` tone `` ( low level resistance ) group control exercise . 3 . Reassess group additional 12 week measure identify identify well three group maintain function . 4 . Examine mechanisms underlie change functional mobility performance self-reported function result intervention Primary hypothesis 1 : Compared chair-based exercise control end week 12 , cardiac rehabilitation functional circuit training group show improvement measure peak aerobic capacity , submaximal oxygen uptake kinetics , functional mobility performance , self-reported function . Primary hypothesis 2 : Compared two group give exercise instruction , functional circuit training group , continue home activity exercise program , show less decline week 24 measure peak aerobic capacity , submaximal oxygen uptake kinetics , functional mobility performance , self-reported function . Secondary hypothesis : Measures submaximal oxygen uptake kinetics well predictor change functional mobility performance self-reported function peak aerobic capacity , muscle strength , joint range motion , balance , behavioral factor ( depression ) .</detailed_description>
