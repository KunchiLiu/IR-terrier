	<detailed_description>Lowering blood pressure reduces risk first ever recurrent stroke . There extensive evidence blood pressure lower follow acute stroke , even call normal level . However , clear soon acute stroke blood pressure lower . Observational study demonstrate increased mortality high low blood pressure . The optimal management blood pressure immediate post-stroke period remain controversial . Although uncertainty exist regard lower blood pressure acute stage stroke , two large randomise controlled trial demonstrate unequivocally intense management blood pressure start &gt; 4 week onset stroke significantly reduce risk recurrent stroke . Both trial use Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor ( ACE-I ) base regime . It propose benefit may due direct result ACE-I rather blood pressure lower per se . Similar vasculoprotective effect see ARBs , evidence safety efficacy acute stroke limit patient high blood pressure ( &gt; 200/110 ) . The trial ( ACCESS ) terminate prematurely due positive imbalance favour intervention ARB Candesartan . If intervention convey potential benefit need start soon possible follow acute event order ischaemic cascade lead neuronal death may modify . Further research first require order demonstrate safety efficacy use way . ACCOST two phase randomise control trial design address important research question . Phase I four week double blind placebo control phase patient receive either Candesartan 4 mg daily match placebo , blood pressure treatment target . A treatment titration step occurs two week , subject titration criterion , subject receive either Candesartan 8 mg daily match placebo . After first four week , subject unblinded enter Phase II trial . Phase II eight week open label comparison Candesartan 'usual care ' ACE-I base treatment regime . Blood pressure treat reach British Hypertension Society target blood pressure &lt; 140/85 , without additional therapy . Blinded outcome measure include neurological recovery base National Institutes Health Stroke Scale , well functional recovery . Incidence first dose hypotension change renal function also collect .</detailed_description>
