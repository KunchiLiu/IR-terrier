	<brief_title>Chronic Low Back Pain Research Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) major health problem VA , affect 15 % veteran . Nationally , medical disability cost exceed $ 50 billion annually . Despite impact , relatively little research evaluate treatment CLBP . Wide variation pattern care suggest uncertainty effective therapy . Most chronic back case surgical candidate . The mainstays medical treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , muscle relaxant , opioids , antidepressant . Non-steroidal drug muscle relaxant effective acute chronic back pain . Opioids may provide analgesia safety limit use . Tricyclic antidepressant provide modest pain relief , separate effect depression . But clear additional research need develop effective pharmacotherapy . One approach favor many authority determine agent effective one type chronic pain syndrome ( e.g. , diabetic neuropathy ) generalize syndromes , like chronic back pain . Another identify effective drug combination , base select drug differ therapeutic mechanism . This research program rigorous randomize clinical trial test efficacy antidepressant analgesia chronic back pain . Because chronic pain complex disorder , program feature multidisciplinary research team , involve specialist psychiatry , orthopedic surgery , psychology , anesthesiology , clinical pharmacology , biomathematics . The research pragmatic explanatory aim . Our strategy test antidepressant differ , selective property attempt isolate therapeutic mechanism . Thus , begin trial use selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , rather dual noradrenergic serotonergic effect ( e.g. , amitriptyline , imipramine ) . To ensure applicability result , use rigorous diagnostic procedure identify patient chronic back pain due degenerative disk disease . To enhance generalizability recruit primary care patient rather tertiary pain clinic sample . Patients without major depression study examine analgesia separate antidepressant effect . Secondary outcome address function life quality . We conduct three control trial use identical recruitment assessment methodology . The first , compare noradrenergic antidepressant ( nortriptyline ) placebo , indicate noradrenergic agent provide clinically relevant analgesia . The second head-to-head comparison selective noradrenergic agent ( maprotiline ) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI , paroxetine ) . The noradrenergic agent outperform SSRI , equivalent placebo . To clarify result explore whether efficacy might evident specific drug concentration . Therefore , third study , prospective concentration design compare potent selective noradrenergic antidepressant ( desipramine ) standard SSRI , fluoxetine . Subjects randomize placebo predetermine concentration window reflect low , medium , high exposure study drug follow 12 week . Interim analysis suggest low concentration desipramine outperforms placebo ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . It also superior mid-concentration high exposure desipramine -- well exposure level SSRI , equivalent placebo . In sum , three study support noradrenergic analgesia CLBP , two study evaluate SSRIs fail find analgesia . This suggest noradrenergic activity , perhaps within therapeutic window , may primarily responsible back pain analgesia . These finding lead u away study propose combine noradrenergic serotonergic agent . An alternative approach build data , first employ another class agent , seem reasonable . This strategy ass gabapentin , calcium channel blocker agent demonstrate efficacy neuropathic pain , extend chronic back pain . We conduct double-blind , randomized assignment , 12-week , placebo control clinical trial efficacy gabapentin . Non-depressed chronic low back pain patient ( N = 130 ) randomize placebo high dose gabapentin ( 3600 mg/day maximum tolerable dose ) . Analysis intent treat . The primary efficacy assessment mean pain intensity ( Descriptor Differential Scale , DDS ) exit . Secondary outcome function life quality ( Oswestry Disability Index , Short Form-36 , Quality Well-Being Scale ) . Safety evaluation include rating adverse event ( Scandinavian Society Psychopharmacology Committee Clinical Investiagations Side Effects Rating Scale , UKU ) , standardized physical examination , clinical laboratory test . Results could provide explanatory insight mechanism back pain , address pragmatic clinical need primary care provider others effective therapy .</detailed_description>
