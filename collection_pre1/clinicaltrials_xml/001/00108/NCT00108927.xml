	<detailed_description>The focus study primary care environment , majority patient diabetes seek on-going health care . The propose group-randomized control clinical trial-targeted 24 primary care clinics-evaluates effectiveness TRANSLATE intervention , multifaceted diabetes intervention program promoting well comprehensive diabetes management . The intervention begin evaluate organizational structure primary care office identify exist barrier small complex system . A set nine well-developed intervention components-selected among successful strategy literature alter clinical outcomes-are introduce correct exist deficiency clinic . The TRANSLATE component function interdependent system , provide substantial support provider patient . Key feature include target high-risk patient , patient reminder system routine visit , passive patient-specific physician reminder , disease-specific network reporting system , physician education . Implementation facilitate local diabetes intervention team assist site coordinator local physician champion . Notably , model centralize care , rather promote dissemination care delivery improvement promote infrastructure change primary care clinic care deliver . Quality improvement method employ optimize implementation unique clinic setting . Upper level administrative personnel integrate regular review implementation measure resource use . The study hypothesis implementation TRANSLATE intervention result meaningful improvement physiologic outcome measure important disease process measures-at reasonable cost-within primary care setting . The specific aim project rigorously evaluate effectiveness TRANSLATE program compare intervention control clinic follow three clinical economic outcome : 1. change A1c systolic blood pressure value among patient diagnose diabetes mellitus participate primary care clinic 12 month ; 2. quality diabetes care delivery measure distribution prevalence appropriate A1c , microalbumin , low density lipoprotein measurement , foot exam 12 month ; 3. economic impact health care delivery system measure short- long-term cost perspective health care system .</detailed_description>
