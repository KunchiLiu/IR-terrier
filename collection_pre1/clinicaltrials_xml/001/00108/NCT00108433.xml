	<criteria>To eligible study , patient must provide informed consent must meet following criterion . No study procedure , include baseline test , perform patient ( parent/legally acceptable representative , appropriate ) legally sign inform consent form . Male female , 18 year age old &gt; = 40 kg body weight Endstage renal disease patient hemodialysis : A ) Signs symptom localize catheterrelated infection ( eg tenderness and/or pain , erythema , swell , purulent exudate within 2 cm entry site ) ; OR B ) A body temperature &gt; = 38.0 C &lt; 36.0 C ( oral equivalent ) ; OR C ) A Grampositive blood culture . If Grampositive isolate S. aureus , must culture least 1 culture bottle either peripheral set catheter set culture bottle . For Grampositive pathogen ( eg , coagulasenegative staphylococci ) , isolate need culture least 2 culture bottle one must peripheral set . There must obvious source bacteremia Presence least one follow systemic sign infection ( may obtain 24 hour prior baseline ) : *Hypotension , define systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg reduction &gt; = 40 mmHg patient 's baseline , absence cause hypotension ; *Tachycardia define pulse rate &gt; 90 beat per minute ; *Tachypnea define respiratory rate &gt; 20 breath per minute PACO2 &lt; 32 torr ; *White blood count &gt; 10,000 cells/mm3 &lt; 4,000 cells/mm3 , differential count show &gt; 10 % band neutrophil form . Patients hemodialysis tunnel nontunneled catheter include antibiotic coat hemodialysis catheter . Patients may one concurrent catheter . Patients willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test study procedure Patients present follow include study : Catheterrelated bloodstream infection cause Gramnegative bacteria , fungi , mixed culture Gram negative bacteria Gram positive bacteria mixed culture Gram positive/negative bacteria fungi Patients evidence infection result bacteremia , clinical radiographic sign osteomyelitis , endocarditis , skin/skin structure infection , pneumonia , urinary tract infection , joint infection , intraabdominal infection , septic thrombophlebitis infection Patients infect catheter remove Patients permanent intravascular device artificial vascular graft , implantable pacemaker defibrillator ; intraaortic balloon pump , leave ventricular assist device ; intravascular transplant prosthetic cardiac valve ; nonintravascular device peritoneal dialysis catheter ; neurosurgical device ventriculoperitoneal shunt , intracranial pressure monitor , epidural catheter , prosthetic cardiac valve , prosthetic vascular graft , internal prosthesis Females childbearing potential unable unwilling take adequate contraceptive precaution , positive pregnancy result within 24 hour prior study entry , know pregnant , currently breastfeed infant Identification pathogen resistant linezolid vancomycin Patients unlikely survive treatment period evaluation Administration glycopeptide antibiotic within 5 day prior enrollment . Administration potentially effective systemic Grampositive antibiotic 48 hour within 72 hour prior enrollment unless pathogen show drug resistance Previous enrollment protocol Hypersensitivity linezolid , vancomycin , gentamicin one excipients ( aztreonam nonbacteremic Gramnegative coverage require ) Concurrent use another investigational medication use within 30 day study entry Patients pressor fluidresistant hemodynamic compromise pulmonary embolism</criteria>
