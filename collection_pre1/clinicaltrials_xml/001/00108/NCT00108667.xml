	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect experimental drug talampanel dyskinesia ( involuntary movement ) develop patient Parkinson 's disease result long-term treatment levodopa ( Sinemet ) . The drug test alone combination amantadine-a drug commonly use alleviate dyskinesia . Patients 21 80 year age Parkinson 's disease dyskinesia may eligible study . Screening baseline evaluation . Participants evaluate medical history , physical neurologic examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) pregnancy test , applicable . A chest x-ray MRI CT scan brain do need . Patients stop take antiparkinsonian medication one month ( 2 month take Selegiline ) study begin throughout duration , except certain medicine allow , include Sinemet , Mirapex Requip . Amantadine take 1 week beginning study . Dose-finding phase . Patients admit NIH Clinical Center 2 3 day levodopa `` dose-finding '' procedure . For test , patient stop take Sinemet instead infuse vein . During infusion , drug dose increase slowly parkinsonian symptom improve unacceptable side effect occur maximum study dose reach . Symptoms monitor frequently . At give time infusion , saline give instead Sinemet . The infusion usually begin early morning continue even . Patients resume take Sinemet infusion . ( Patients dose infusion last 3 month undergo phase study . ) After dose-finding phase , patient randomly assign take placebo ( `` sugar pill '' ) talampanel . Those take talampanel also receive amantadine usual dosage . At point study , amantadine replace placebo . Patients talampanel group also receive placebo portion study . Active study phase . At study week 1 , 5 7 , patient admit Clinical Center overnight levodopa infusion talampanel placebo . The day infusion , patient brief physical examination , blood urine test , EKG , review symptom change condition . The next day , receive infusion levodopa dose determine dose-finding phase . Then take pill contain either talampanel placebo . Their parkinsonian symptom dyskinesias evaluate videotaped every 30 minute 6 hour . Blood drawn EKG obtain . At end infusion rating , patient resume regular Parkinson 's medication give new supply study medication take home . At week 2 , 3 , 4 6 , patient come Clinical Center review drug side effect . They blood drawn receive new supply study medication last next visit . Follow-up . Two week study end , patient contact phone review side effect return clinic evaluation .</brief_summary>
