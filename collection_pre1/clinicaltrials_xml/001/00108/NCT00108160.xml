	<detailed_description>Treatment staphylococcal carriage topical antibiotic , mupirocin , lead decreased infection hemodialysis patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient . However , study placebo control certain subset patient benefit . Relapse colonization , generally within 90 day treatment stop , presumably increase risk infection , approach 50 % . Continuous use mupirocin daily , three time weekly , weekly basis result increased resistance drug . Despite lack evidence , use mupirocin become commonplace perceived effective simple mean prevent infection . In National Institutes Aging/Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center ( NIA/OAIC ) -sponsored proposal , find 2 week treatment regimen mupirocin ointment effective decolonize old chronically ill nursing home resident S. aureus compare placebo ointment . Decolonization begin decline 3 month post-treatment , resistance occur 52 treated patient . That study power detect difference infection 2 study group ; end point eradication colonization . However , trend towards reduction staphylococcal infection mupirocin see . In addition , therapeutic failure resident colonize methicillin-resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) methicillin-sensitive S. aureus ( MSSA ) . We hypothesize intermittent treatment mupirocin ointment every 3 month may effective mean prevent recolonization infection S. aureus . We propose study patient population already treatment severe S. aureus infection significant risk subsequent infection . Patients receive mupirocin 2 % polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) ointment [ Treatment Arm ] polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) ointment [ Placebo Arm ] 14 day every 3 month . The effect two regimen S. aureus re-infection , re-colonization , development mupirocin resistance assess .</detailed_description>
