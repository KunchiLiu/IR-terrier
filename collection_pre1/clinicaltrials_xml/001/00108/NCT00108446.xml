	<brief_summary>This study do collect new information irritable bowel syndrome , disease cause abdominal pain get good treatment keep come back ( `` chronic '' ) . To good understand cause irritable bowel syndrome , study drug use treat pain , dextromethorphan , naloxone , fentanyl , lidocaine . We study effect drug experimental pain . Dextromethorphan use non-prescription cough syrup . Naloxone use reverse effect narcotic pain reliever . Fentanyl narcotic use treat pain make person relax ( sedate ) anesthesia . The purpose study see kind pain affected drug person irritable bowel syndrome person problem .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization Pain Processing Mechanisms Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) common gastrointestinal disorder characterize chronic abdominal pain alter bowel function ( diarrhea and/or constipation ) effect 20 % United States population . Although pathophysiology IBS unknown , visceral hypersensitivity ( i.e. , decrease pain threshold response gut distension ) biological marker disorder . The mechanisms lead visceral hypersensitivity , however , currently unknown . As consequence current VA-supported study , laboratory acquire evidence patient IBS visceral hypersensitivity also cutaneous hypersensitivity response experimental thermal pain stimulus . These new finding differ previous investigation indicate IBS-associated hypersensitivity limit gut . Rather , data suggest patient IBS alteration central pain processing mechanism may represent underlie pathophysiological basis visceral cutaneous hypersensitivity . Based preliminary data , propose alteration spinal processing mechanism similar patient IBS describe patient chronic pain disorder . Cutaneous hypersensitivity also see chronic pain condition fibromyalgia altered central pain processing mechanism show responsible maintain hypersensitivity . In current proposal , hypothesize IBS patient increase peripheral central afferent processing nociceptive cutaneous visceral stimulus . Our objective follow : - Specific Objective # 1 . To determine lidocaine apply rectum decrease visceral hyperalgesia , test nociceptive rectal distension . - Specific Objective # 2 . To determine lidocaine apply rectum decrease cutaneous heat hyperalgesia test presence absence central hyperalgesia IBS patient . - Specific Objective # 3 . To determine relationship dose IV lidocaine , serum level IV lidocaine , anti-hyperalgesic effect , test rectal distension cutaneous heat stimulation . Specific Objective # 4 . To determine effect rectal lidocaine clinical pain clinical symptom IBS . The proposed study test central hypothesis use well-controlled sensory stimulus design separately evaluate central peripheral mechanism . The objective accomplish systematically apply compare pharmacological psychophysical study IBS patient control . This application extension principal investigator 's current VA Advanced Career Development Award examine neurobiology visceral hypersensitivity Persian Gulf veteran return home chronic abdominal pain . The proposed Clinical Research Program study afferent mechanism visceral cutaneous hypersensitivity veteran IBS . Our laboratory uniquely position use expertise psychophysical pharmacologic evaluation patient fibromyalgia study patient IBS . The result current proposal lead large clinical trial sodium-channel blocker ( i.e. , lidocaine , mexiletine ) potential therapeutic agent veteran IBS .</detailed_description>
