	<brief_title>Study Determine Safety Two Applications PEP005 Topical Gel Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCCs ) common skin problem largely cause long term sun exposure . Current treatment include surgery , curettage/desiccation simple excision , often cosmetically disfigure . Non-invasive alternative therapy treatment BCC lesion thus research . Sap plant Euphorbia peplus use many year Australia `` folk '' remedy treat number skin condition . The active component Euphorbia peplus isolate make gel apply directly skin Peplin Ltd. To date , one well-controlled study PEP005 gel human complete . Sixteen patient receive single application PEP005 0.01 % vehicle gel actinic keratoses chest , shoulder , back and/or arm . Results show good tolerance evidence activity . The current study design evaluate safety two application PEP005 gel patient superficial basal cell carcinoma ( sBCC ) arm , shoulder , chest , face and/or scalp , test three concentration accord two treatment regimen . Approximately 60 patient plan include multiple Australian center . Efficacy cosmetic outcome assess recommended treatment regimen determine . Assignment treatment random patient medical staff blind treatment . Patients two visit treatment application return check-up visit day first application several time thereafter approximately 3 month .</detailed_description>
