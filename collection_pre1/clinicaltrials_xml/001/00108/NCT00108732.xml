	<brief_summary>Vaccines make gene-modified virus may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Biological therapy , GM-CSF , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Drugs , bicalutamide goserelin , may stop adrenal gland make androgens patient whose tumor cell continue grow . Giving vaccine therapy together GM-CSF , need , androgen ablation may effective treatment prostate cancer . This phase II trial study well give vaccine therapy together GM-CSF work treat patient prostate cancer progress surgery and/or radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study PROSTVAC-V ( Vaccinia ) /TRICOM PROSTVAC-F ( Fowlpox ) /TRICOM With GM-CSF Patients With PSA Progression After Local Therapy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect PROSTVAC-V/TRICOM ( Vaccinia ) cycle 1 follow PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM ( Fowlpox ) GM-CSF biochemical PSA progression 6 month . II . To determine change PSA velocity pre-treatment post-treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate percentage patient experience &gt; 50 % decline serum PSA repeat 4 week . II . To evaluate tolerability toxicity relate treatment PSA vaccine GM-CSF . III . To determine effect GM-CSF PSA immediately treatment ( day 4 ) compare delayed effect ( day 15 ) . IV . To determine PSA nadir , percentage patient undetectable PSA , treat combined vaccine androgen ablation therapy 12 month . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive vaccinia-PSA-TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) SC day 1-4 week 1-4 . Beginning week 5 , patient receive fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine SC day 1 GM-CSF SC day 1-4 . Treatment fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine GM-CSF repeat every 4 week 3 course ( week 5-16 ) . Beginning week 17 , patient receive fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine GM-CSF every 12 week absence clinical biochemical disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients biochemical clinical disease progression receive androgen ablation therapy comprise oral bicalutamide daily 1 month goserelin SC every 4 week addition fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine GM-CSF . Treatment continue absence clinical biochemical disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 45 patient accrue study within 6 month .</detailed_description>
