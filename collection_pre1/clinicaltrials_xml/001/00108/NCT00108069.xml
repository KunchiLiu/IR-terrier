	<brief_summary>This study determine whether drug tamoxifen bortezomib delay tumor growth patient recurrent glioma ( malignant brain tumor ) . Tamoxifen may work interfere internal signaling need cancer grow . Bortezomib may also interfere tumor growth process . Laboratory study show low dos bortezomib significantly enhance glioma cell death use tamoxifen . Patients 18 year age old glioma whose tumor respond standard medical treatment take enzyme-inducing anti-seizure medication Dilantin , phenobarbitol , Tegretol , may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination , blood test , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) . MRI CT scan produce image brain show brain tumor growing ( see ) . Participants receive treatment 6-week cycle 1 year . ( The treatment duration may extend patient continue tolerate drug show sign tumor growth 1 year . ) During cycle , patient take six tamoxifen tablet twice day every day receive bortezomib infusion vein day 3 , 6 , 10 , 13 , 24 , 27 , 31 34 . Treatment may continue long tumor grow patient develop unacceptable side effect . In addition drug treatment , patient undergo follow test procedure : - Periodic routine blood test . - MRI CT scan head start new cycle . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . CT use x-rays provide 3-dimensional view part body study . For procedure , patient lie table slide cylindrical scanner . - Blood test measure level bortezomib . Blood drawn bortezomib infusion day 3 24 , 4 hour infusion day 24 first treatment cycle . - Dynamic MRI spectroscopy positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Patients may ask undergo one test , help distinguish live tumor die tumor . The experience dynamic MRI spectroscopy standard MRI do time standard procedure ( see ) . PET us radioactive substance show cellular activity specific tissue body . The patient give injection sugar solution radioactive isotope attach sugar molecule . A special camera detect radiation emit radioisotope , result image show much glucose use various part body . Because rapidly grow cell , tumor , take use glucose normal cell , test use show active tumor . - Drug diary . Patients maintain calendar record take study drug side effect develop .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tamoxifen Bortezomib Treat Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Tamoxifen ( TAM ) , member selective estrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) family , widely use treatment estrogen receptor ( ER ) express breast cancer . It previously show high-dose TAM cytotoxic activity glioma cell , whether effect drug-specific represent general property SERMs unknown . We demonstrate suppression nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activate B cell ( NF-kB ) activation markedly enhance SERM-induced apoptosis , suggest role NF-kB protect glioma cell SERM-induced cytotoxicity . Bortezomib potent inhibitor 26S proteosome cause significant anti-proliferative cytotoxic effect number cell line protean effect variety cellular signaling pathway , include ability potently inhibit NF-kB pathway . We recently demonstrate bortezomib significant anti-glioma activity vitro ongoing clinical trial demonstrate possible activity patient recurrent glioma . We also generate preclinical data demonstrate bortezomib combination Tamoxifen synergistic cytotoxic effect glioma cell . Thus , give minimal modest activity drug patient recurrent glioma , give spectrum non-overlapping toxicity , give mark synergistic glioma cell kill combination drug preclinical screen , propose phase II trial bortezomib combination Tamoxifen patient recurrent glioma take enzyme induce anti-epileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) . Objectives : The primary statistical endpoint response ( define either stable disease objective response standard neuro-oncology clinical trial ) 6 week treatment . Eligibility : Patients histologically proven high-grade glioma patient clinical radiographic diagnosis brainstem glioma eligible protocol . Design : The phase II study stratify type high grade glioma ( anaplastic glioma ( AA ) glioblastoma ( GBM ) ) two-stage min-max design maximum 41 patient GBM stratum 36 patient AA stratum .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients histologically proven highgrade glioma patient clinical radiographic diagnosis brainstem glioma eligible protocol . Highgrade glioma include glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ; stratum 1 ) variant gliosarcoma anaplastic glioma ( AG ; stratum 2 ) , anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( AO ) , anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma ( AMO ) , malignant astrocytoma/glioma NOS ( otherwise specify ) . Patients must unequivocal evidence tumor progression magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) computerize tomography ( CT ) scan . This scan perform within 14 day prior registration steroid dosage stable least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date image registration new baseline MR/CT require . The type scan , i.e. , MRI CT must use throughout period protocol treatment tumor measurement . Patients undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible long follow condition apply : 1 . They recover effect surgery . 2 . Residual disease follow resection recurrent tumor mandate eligibility study . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , CT/ MRI do : later 96 hour immediate postoperative period least 4 week postoperatively , within 14 day registration , steroid dosage stable least 5 day . If 96 hour scan 21 day registration , scan need repeat . If steroid dose increase date imaging registration , new baseline MRI/CT require stable steroid dosage least 5 day . Patients must fail prior radiation therapy must interval great equal 4 week completion radiation therapy study entry . Ability subject Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients must great equal 18 year old , life expectancy great 8 week . Patients must Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy : 2 week investigational agent , 4 week prior cytotoxic therapy , two week vincristine , 6 week nitrosoureas , 3 week procarbazine administration , 1 week noncytotoxic agent , e.g. , interferon , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc . ( radiosensitizer count ) . Any question relate definition noncytotoxic agent direct Study Chair . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( white blood cell ( WBC ) great equal 3,000/microl , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1,500/mm^3 , platelet count great equal 100,000/mm^3 , hemoglobin great equal 10 gm/dl ) , adequate liver function ( serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) bilirubin le 2 time ULN ) , adequate renal function ( creatinine le 1.5 mg/dL and/or creatinine clearance great equal 60 cc/min ) start therapy . These test must perform within 14 day prior registration . Eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion . Patients must significant medical illness investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient ' ability tolerate therapy . This study design include woman minority , design measure difference intervention effect . Males female recruit preference gender . No exclusion study base race . Minorities actively recruit participate . Patients must practice adequate contraception . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients , view treat physician , significant active cardiac ( documented coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , arrhythmia require medication ) , hepatic ( hepatocellular and/or cholestatic dysfunction document liver biopsy , liver ultrasound , abnormal liver function blood test , renal ( documented renal biopsy , ultrasound , CT/MRI scan reflect blood test psychiatric disease ( require hospitalization significant severity impair patient ability cooperate study instruction ) . No concurrent use standard chemotherapeutics investigative agent . Patients know active malignancy glioma ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) . Patients active infection require intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic . Patients pregnant breast feed . Patients disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism . Patients clear tumor progression treat tamoxifen and/or patient treat tamoxifen within past year . Patients take EIAEDs ( enzyme induce antiepileptic drug ) eligible .
