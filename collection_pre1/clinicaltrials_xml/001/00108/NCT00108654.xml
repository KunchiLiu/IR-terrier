	<brief_summary>This study determine safety side effect experimental adenoviral vector vaccine give patient previously receive different HIV vaccine ( VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP ) prior NIAID study . The study also monitor participant social impact HIV vaccine study ( e.g. , problem insurance , health care , friend , family , employment , housing , forth ) . The study vaccine make use adenovirus ( common virus cause upper respiratory infection , common cold , eye infection , urine infection diarrhea ) modify contain DNA cod three HIV protein . The modified virus reproduce body cause HIV disease adenoviral infection . Healthy volunteer previously receive three injection VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP NIAID study VRC 007 ( protocol 04-I-0254 ) may eligible study . Participants receive one injection adenoviral vector vaccine . It give day enroll study , single injection upper arm muscle . Also day brief physical examination , medical history , blood urine test , pregnancy test woman , counseling , need , HIV pregnancy avoidance . Subjects observed side effect least 30 minute vaccination require telephone clinic staff 1 2 day injection follow-up . In addition , give diary card take home , record temperature symptom daily 5 day . Subjects return clinic 5 follow-up visit week 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 24 injection . At visit check health change problem since last visit , ask feeling medication take . They blood draw every visit urine sample collect visit . They test HIV three time question sexual behavior drug use . They also complete `` social impact '' questionnaire last visit . Subjects ask undergo apheresis week 4 visit . This procedure allow collection large number white blood cell obtain simple blood draw . The white cell study see immune system respond study vaccine . For apheresis , blood collect needle arm vein spin machine separate component . The white blood cell extract rest blood return body needle . Subjects undergo apheresis 1/3 cup blood sample drawn use needle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I open-label study examine safety , tolerability immune response multiclade HIV adenoviral vector vaccine booster vaccination uninfected adult . The hypothesis vaccine safe booster vaccine elicit immune response HIV . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP booster vaccination uninfected subject previously receive 3 injection VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP . The secondary objective include immunogenicity evaluation , adenovirus serotype 5 ( Ad5 ) antibody titer , social impact . Exploratory evaluation include epitope mapping immunogenicity evaluation . Product Description : VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP ( rAd ) recombinant product compose 4 adenoviral vector ( 3:1:1:1 ratio ) encode HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein clade B HIV-1 Env glycoproteins clades A , B , C , respectively . Subjects : Healthy adult volunteer previously receive three injection VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP dosage 4 mg VRC 007 study ( 04-I-0254 ) . The subject group 20 36 year old time enrollment VRC 007 ; participate VRC 010 36 week old time enrollment VRC 010 . Study Plan : Up fourteen volunteer receive one 1 mL injection study agent dosage 1010 particle unit ( PU ) intramuscularly ( IM ) deltoid muscle . Safety immunogenicity evaluate follow-up visit subsequent 24 week . The peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) sample immunogenicity study collect Week 4 vaccination obtain apheresis subject willing eligible apheresis apheresis appointment conveniently schedule interval specify ; otherwise PBMCs obtain 80 mL blood collect phlebotomy . Study Duration : Subjects evaluate 6 clinical visit 24 week study injection . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint safety vaccine administer dose 10 ( 10 ) PU IM injection . Secondary endpoint immunogenicity indicate HIV-specific antibody Week 4 , cellular immune response Week 6 , Ad5 antibody titer Week 0 Week 4 social impact Week 24 . Exploratory analysis include immunogenicity Weeks 12 24 , Ad5 antibody titer Week 24 epitope mapping CD8+ CD4+ T cell response Week 4 .</detailed_description>
