	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) important co-infection HIV epidemic ; bi-directional relationship two disease well establish . HIV increase risk TB acquisition , reactivation , reinfection , reduce survival compare patient TB alone . In individual HIV , TB infection result reduce survival , increased risk opportunistic infection , elevation HIV replication . Improving outcome HIV-infected individual develop TB high importance . Initiating antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) shortly initiate TB treatment may improve outcome individual co-infected HIV TB . However , data support suggestion limit study begin . This study determine appropriate time initiate ART HIV-infected individual recently initiate treatment TB . This study last 48 week comprise two step . At study entry , participant underwent clinical assessment , drug adherence training , blood collection . In Step 1 , participant randomly assign one two arm . Participants Arm A initiated ART approximately 2 week TB treatment . Participants Arm B defer ART 8 12 week TB treatment . In Step 2 , Arm B participant initiated ART ; Arm A participant enter Step 2 . ART consist efavirenz ( EFV ) emtricitabine ( FTC ) /tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) ; FTC TDF could give individual agent . Drug substitution could make participant could tolerate specify regimen . Blood collection clinical assessment occur week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 .</detailed_description>
