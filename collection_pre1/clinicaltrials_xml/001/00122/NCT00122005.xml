	<brief_summary>Androgen ( male sex hormone ) deprivation standard therapy metastatic prostate cancer result regression control disease 80-85 % patient . This hormone therapy result progression-free survival 12-18 month overall survival 24-30 month . However , patient ultimately develop hormone-refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) . Management HRPC patient significant challenge patient physician . Neither past current chemotherapy regimen show curative potential patient HRPC . Thus new treatment strategy high priority . A major focus new treatment strategy enlist aid immune system , particularly development prostate cancer vaccine . There number study use dendritic cell base vaccine treatment well tolerate . Specific T-cell immune response observe occasional evidence tumor regression . A reduction serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) observe well . Lengthening time-to-progression delay onset bone pain observe subset patient HRPC . The initial preclinical observation suggest granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene transduce allogeneic ( GVAX ) prostate cancer vaccine may efficacious poorly immunogenic cancer report . The objective study evaluate safety immunologic effect vaccination Allogeneic Prostate GVAXÂ® ( CG1940 &amp; CG8711 ) patient make lymphopenic treatment chemotherapy infuse autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . Clinical observation laboratory measurement monitor evaluate safety , toxicity immune response . Additionally , effect treatment serum PSA level tumor response evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Other investigator focus tumor cell-based vaccine strategy use either allogeneic autologous tumor cell . Vaccines derive allogeneic melanoma tumor cell line associate clinically significant toxicity give alone . Most tumor cell line vaccine lethally irradiate , genetically modify . However , new generation tumor vaccine genetically modify enhance tumor-associated antigen presentation patient T cell reach early clinical trial . Based extensive preclinical study clinical allogeneic prostate cancer vaccine data , strong impression exist ex vivo GM-CSF gene transfer may make human prostate cancer cell line potent induce clinically relevant antitumor immune response men micrometastatic prostate cancer . In early clinical study irradiate GM-CSF-secreting autologous cancer cell vaccine treatment advance kidney cancer advance melanoma , immune response elicit vaccination appear dependent vaccine cell dose administer level GM-CSF secretion vaccine cell . A significant fraction nearly 50,000 men year suffer life-threatening prostate cancer candidate autologous tumor vaccine treatment simply insufficient number autologous prostatic carcinoma cell available surgery . These men may benefit allogeneic GM-CSF-gene-transduced prostate cancer vaccine . Theoretically , autologous prostate cancer cell may best source prostate cancer antigens elicit therapeutically useful immune response . However , evidence accumulate suggest allogeneic prostatic carcinoma cell might also serve useful source prostate cancer antigen prostate cancer vaccine construction . One theoretical concern use allogeneic prostate cancer cell prime antigen specific T-cell immunity whether cytolytic T lymphocyte ( CTLs ) restrict HLA molecule patient 's tumor prim vaccine cell express different ( allogeneic ) HLA molecule . Recent work show GM-CSF gene transduce tumor cell directly prime MHC class I restrict CTLs broken recipient 's antigen-presenting cell , process present antigen HLA molecule prime T cell . In fact , tumor cell express MHC class I molecules nevertheless capable generate systemic antitumor immunity comparable MHC class I positive counterpart . Phase I II study allogeneic prostate cancer vaccine perform patient metastatic prostate cancer . One Phase I trial CG1940 alone one phase I/II trial CG1940 CG8711 use AAV GM-CSF vaccine cell . These trial currently progress evaluate safety time progression PSA bone scan . In trial vaccine administer dose level 5 x 10^7 , 1 x 10^8 , 2 x 10^8 , 3 x 10^8 cell every 2 4 week 3 12 vaccination 5 x 10^8 cell prime vaccination follow 3 x 10^8 cell boost vaccination every 2 week total 13 vaccination . Preliminary analysis 12 patient enrolled phase I trial show one patient stable disease . Eighty patient enrol phase II trial . Sixty-five patient phase II trial follow median 4 month . One patient partial PSA response , 10 maintain stable PSAs . Follow-up bone scan obtain 33 patient . One patient show improvement metastatic lesion bone scan , 12 patient maintain stable disease bone scan . ICTP assay Treatment 1 , Treatment 4 , First Follow-Up Visit fifteen patient . The ICTP level decrease five patient ( 33 % ) two undetectable level vaccine treatment . This normalization osteoclast activity suggest novel mechanism immunotherapy metastatic prostate cancer . As November 29 , 2004 , 188 patient received prostate GVAX vaccine . In summary , phase I II trial show CG1940 CG8711 excellent safety profile . As January 24 , 2005 , phase III trial prostate GVAX open 40 medical center USA .</detailed_description>
