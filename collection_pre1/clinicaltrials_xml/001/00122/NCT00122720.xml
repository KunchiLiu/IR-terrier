	<brief_title>The Effect Darbepoetin Upon Rehabilitation Colorectal Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major surgery elicit metabolic stress response follow loss body mass , fatigue , impaired physical performance include reduce work capacity . To perform ordinary daily activity many elderly people exert close maximum physical capacity , even small reduction performance capacity may cause significant impairment physical social activity . Postoperative decline strength work capacity may thus cause previously independent living person become dependent upon assistance others . Hence , important avoid postoperative reduction physical performance minimize postoperative fatigue . It show Erythropoietin treatment reduces need blood transfusion patient undergo plan colonic surgery . However , effect Erythropoietin treatment upon postoperative rehabilitation yet study . Therefore main hypothesis study perioperative treatment Darbepoetin Alfa would improve physical capacity aspects reduce postoperative fatigue improve work capacity , balance quality life compare placebo treatment . Furthermore , researcher expect Darbepoetin treat patient fewer perioperative complication less need blood transfusion .</detailed_description>
