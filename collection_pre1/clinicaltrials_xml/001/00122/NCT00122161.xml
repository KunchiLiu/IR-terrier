	<detailed_description>Background : Hypertension , commonly report medical problem veteran , major risk factor heart disease stroke . Lowering blood pressure decrease risk adverse clinical outcome . Widely promote evidence-based clinical practice guideline set target blood pressure adequate control , yet hypertensive , include VA patient , meet target . Guidelines also call use specific drug depend patient 's pattern comorbid characteristic ; yet , clinician often prescribe drug guideline-concordant . Objectives : The long term objective work contribute VA 's ability respond flexibly rapidly evolve medical knowledge establish system guideline use throughout VA nationally implement multiple different clinical practice . In collaboration Stanford Medical Informatics develop automate decision support system hypertension management , know ATHENA DSS build EON technology guideline-based decision support . ATHENA DSS incorporate hundred knowledge rule operationalize guideline hypertension . Methods : ATHENA DSS combine patient information VistA automate knowledge base hypertension generate patient-specific recommendation management hypertension display primary care clinicians pop-up window VA�s Computerized Patient Record System ( CPRS ) record appropriate patient open day schedule primary care clinic visit . The ATHENA DSS pop-up provide advice adequacy control blood pressure specific recommendation drug therapy hypertension , visual display patient�s medication history concurrent blood pressure , evidence support main recommendation , information . We deploy system three VA medical center -- Durham , San Francisco , Palo Alto�and conduct clinician-randomized trial . We log data use system , monitor comment enter clinician , conduct questionnaire survey clinician . We plan analysis impact clinician prescribe patient blood pressure . We plan preparation dissemination system additional VA medical center . Status : Project work ongoing time prepare report . We recently receive notice funding VISN collaborative use ATHENA DSS five medical center VISN 1 ( New England ) .</detailed_description>
