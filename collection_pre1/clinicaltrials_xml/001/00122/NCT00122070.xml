Those item screen positive subject Personality questionnaire evaluate pertinent subsection SKID-II . Concomitant Therapy Antipsychotic agent quetiapine allow study period . Patients take antipsychotic medication require least three day washout period prior baseline visit . Patients anticonvulsant , lithium benzodiazepine allow enter study dose agent three month prior baseline visit How Will Study Be Analyzed Laboratory Studies : Studies do baseline screen liver disease , kidney disease , electrolyte imbalance , thyroid parathyroid dysfunction , respiratory acidosis alkalosis , anemia , adequate blood cell platelet count , pregnancy , presence illegal drug . Any subject significant laboratory abnormality exclude study . Adverse Events : Subjects screen follow side effect quetiapine dizziness ( 10 % ) , postural hypotension ( 7 % ) , dry mouth ( 7 % ) , dyspepsia ( 6 % ) , tachycardia ( 7 % ) somnolence ( 18 % ) . Patients also monitor rare event include seizure , tardive dyskinesia , neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) . Other less common side effect ( &gt; 1 % ) include headache ( 19 % v placebo 17 % ) , asthenia ( 3 % vs 2 % ) , abdominal pain ( 3 % vs 1 % ) , back pain ( 2 % vs 1 % ) , fever ( 2 % vs 1 % ) , constipation ( 9 % vs 5 % ) , w eight gain ( 2 % vs 0 % ) , rash ( 4 % vs 3 % ) , rhinitis ( 3 % vs 1 % ) , ear pain ( 1 % vs 0 % ) . Data Analysis The following report statistically analyze : - Number patient begin complete study ( maximum n = 15 ) . - Patients dropout study terminate reason . - Demographic characteristic patient . - Number patient personality disorder addition Borderline Personality Disorder . - The final average dose quetiapine . - The total score percentage change scale subscale utilized study whether statistically significant increase reduction period quetiapine administration . - Movement Disorder side effect assess Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale Simpson-Angus Scale whether statistically significant increase reduction period quetiapine administration . - The number percentage adverse event occur period quetiapine administration . - The number percentage abnormal laboratory result occur period quetiapine administration . After completion data collection , data analyze determine appropriate parametric analysis . As N study 15 , T-test analysis may applicable data permit . We anticipate preliminary demonstration treatment effect . Individual weekly score serve dependent variable lend one-way analysis demonstrate difference baseline 6 week active treatment . If data permit , two-way T-test also employ demonstrate statistically significant difference treatment effect . As data likely require utilization multiple two-way analysis , data Bonferroni correct order adjust possibility false positive ( type II ) error . Other parametric analysis employ data warrant .</detailed_description>
