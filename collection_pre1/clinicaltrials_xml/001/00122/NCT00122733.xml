	<brief_summary>Patients may agitate wean period mechanical ventilation . Administration loxapine , neuroleptic notably affect ventilatory drive , may help obtain adequate level cooperation , therefore , reduce duration mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Loxapine Weaning From Ventilator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation life-saving procedure critically ill patient . This procedure however devoid risk every effort make shorten duration . This best accomplished implementation weaning protocol . Sedation ( opiates benzodiazepine ) often required patient comfort adaptation respirator . Withdrawal sedation order allow patient resume spontaneous breathing may associate agitation confusion may hinder wean . In case , reinstitution heavy sedation prolong ventilator-dependency . It may therefore interesting administer neuroleptic ( loxapine ) good anxiolytic property notably interfere spontaneous breathe ability . Patients include fail spontaneous ventilation trial ( see inclusion criterion ) mark agitation . Usual simple clinical ( respiratory frequency , P01 measure respirator , arterial pressure , cardiac rate ) biological criterion ( arterial blood gas determination ) measurement sedation/agitation validate scale ( Richmond agitation sedation scale , Ramsay score ) gather patient deem ready trial spontaneous ventilation wean . In case mark agitation accord validated scale , patient give conventional dose ( 150 mg ) loxapine nasogastric tube efficacy treatment evaluate parameter . Demonstration facilitation wean simple strategy would useful order reduce risk associated mechanical ventilation .</detailed_description>
