	<brief_title>Comparison Central Peripheral Venous Catheters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critically ill patient require intravenous administration fluid drug . This achieve via peripheral central catheter . Each device associate mechanical infectious complication . Complications associated central line judge severe . Some patient actually require insertion central line due venous toxicity drug necessity making sure infusion regularly administer ( example : high dose catecholamine infusion ) . Some physician believe Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) patient central venous line insert , whereas others feel patient may receive active drug via peripheral line select instance . No study prospectively compare feasibility , merit complication two possibility ( i.e. , central peripheral venous line ) . This study include patient receive either central peripheral line ( see inclusion criterion ) : mainly patient receive large amount fluid , moderate dos catecholamine drug may cause venous injury . Patients randomize receive either peripheral central venous catheter . Endpoints rate mechanical complication ( difficulty insert line , need repeat insertion attempt , occurrence arterial puncture , occurrence pneumothorax ) infectious complication ( local catheter infection catheter-related bloodstream infection ) .</detailed_description>
