	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Stroke occur 10 % child SCA high risk recurrence without therapy . Affected child receive chronic erythrocyte transfusion prevent secondary stroke , effective limit long-term utility due transmission infectious agent , erythrocyte alloantibody autoantibody formation , iron overload . Transfusion acquire iron overload cause chronic organ damage hepatic fibrosis cirrhosis , poor growth development , cardiac arrhythmia , early sudden death young patient SCA stroke . An alternative transfusion secondary stroke prevention also address issue transfusion acquire iron overload clearly need . Hydroxyurea prevent acute vaso-occlusive event SCA , utility cerebrovascular disease prevention secondary stroke SCA proven . Pilot data indicate hydroxyurea prevent stroke recurrence child SCA ; transfusion discontinue , serial phlebotomy reduces iron burden . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This Phase III randomize clinical trial child SCA . The hypothesis hydroxyurea phlebotomy maintain acceptable stroke recurrence rate significantly reduce hepatic iron burden . The primary aim compare standard therapy ( transfusion chelation ) alternative therapy ( hydroxyurea phlebotomy ) prevention secondary stroke management iron overload . Additional aim include comparison growth development , frequency non-stroke neurological sickle-related event , quality life . The use hydroxyurea secondary stroke prevention , couple removal excess iron phlebotomy , would represent significant improvement management individual SCA stroke . If hydroxyurea effective prevention secondary stroke , may also beneficial child SCA cerebrovascular disease , include risk primary stroke . The trial include approximately 130 child ( 5.0-18.9 year age 65 subject per treatment arm ) SCA symptomatic cerebral infarction treat red cell transfusion least 18 month . After complete baseline screen study , half participant switch therapeutic program hydroxyurea phlebotomy . Half participant remain transfusion chelation . The composite primary endpoint study compare two modality treatment prevention secondary stroke management iron overload . The impetus trial fact long-term transfusion chelation therapy child difficult , frequently unsuccessful , often complicate severe symptomatic iron overload , particularly heart , lung , liver .</detailed_description>
