	<detailed_description>Background : Complications result medication , adverse drug event ( ADEs ) , prevalent major source excess morbidity cost . ADEs particularly problematic old patient higher burden comorbidity diminish physiologic reserve . In addition , old patient likely exposed polypharmacy , major risk factor ADEs . While ADEs may idiosyncratic , many result medical error inadequate system ensure safe effective use medication . The goal propose study test efficacy potentially potent intervention improve use medication older outpatient enrol VA primary care clinic . The intervention-Enhanced Pharmacy Care-involves formal , multi-dimensional evaluation patients� medication regimen train clinical pharmacist board-certified geriatrician . Objectives : The study follow six aim : 1 ) Compare change prescribe practices-as measure medication appropriateness , number medication , cost prescribe medications-between baseline follow-up patient randomize Enhanced Pharmacy Care patient randomize usual care ; 2 ) Compare medication-based endpoint two group , include occurrence potential ADEs , medication compliance , patient knowledge medication ; 3 ) Compare change health-related-quality-of-life two group ; 4 ) Compare patient perception quality VA outpatient care two group ; 5 ) Compare health care utilization one-year study period two group ; 6 ) Examine attitudes primary care provider ( PCPs ) intervention . Methods : Patients eligible trial 65 year old receive prescription &gt; 5 medication VA primary care clinic . Patients randomize usual care intervention , include structured medication history medical record review . For intervention patient , therapeutic recommendation develop present primary care provider . Baseline 3-month measure obtain change assess analysis covariance . Status : 493 patient enrolled trial 12-month follow-up complete 95 % patient . Preliminary result evaluate abstract submit national meeting , include 2004 VA HSR &amp; D 2004 SGIM Annual Meetings present oral presentation . We complete data clean perform final analysis data , manuscript preparation . Final outcome assessment use Medication Appropriateness Index final stage .</detailed_description>
