Unabated stress invasive procedure interfere smooth progression ongoing procedure , also deleterious effect patient need additional procedure dread recurrent medical traumatization . The long-term objective research provide patient simple cop strategy vulnerable time large core biopsy hope behavioral intervention carry recovery future medical procedure . In large prospective randomize study kind , researcher show self-hypnotic intervention percutaneous , image-guided vascular renal intervention result less pain anxiety , great hemodynamic stability , few procedure interruption . The positive effect short initial hypnotic intervention , structured procedure room , become pronounced long procedure last carried immediate post-procedure recovery .

	<detailed_description>Large core image-guided breast biopsy well establish tool diagnose breast cancer . Using ultrasound X-ray guidance , large hollow needle insert skin breast abnormal tissue remove diagnosis . Although procedure much less invasive open surgery , induce pain anxiety tax cop mechanism even high functioning individual . Unrelieved stress medical procedure interfere smooth progression ongoing procedure , also deleterious effect patient need additional procedure feel dread anticipation . The long-term objective research provide patient simple cop strategy time large core biopsy , need . The hope newly learn ability handle distress carry recovery future medical procedure . In prior clinical trial ( Lancet 2000:335:1486-1489 ) , large prospective randomize study kind , researcher show self-hypnotic intervention image-guided intervention blood vessel kidney result less pain anxiety , few worrisome increase decrease blood pressure heart rate , few procedure interruption . The positive effect short initial hypnotic intervention , structured procedure room , become pronounced long procedure last carried immediate post-procedure recovery . Based past finding , researcher therefore predict show evidence contrary current think long-lasting effect require intensive presurgical preparation . The researcher propose pursue three interrelate specific aim : - ( Aim 1 ) : Determine acute effect self-hypnotic relaxation pain anxiety . Strictly define method self-hypnotic relaxation ( Group I ) , test empathic attention ( Group II ) routine standard care ( Group III ) prospective randomize study 240 patient undergoing large core breast biopsy . The impact treatment validate comparing procedure among group subjective measure pain anxiety well objective physiologic indicator pain anxiety ( frequency significant increase heart rate blood pressure ) . - ( Aim 2 ) : Determine delay effect self-hypnotic relaxation . Patients ' level pain , anxiety , stress record day 1-5 biopsy compare among group . Stress level measurement base objective test ( amount stress hormone cortisol patient 's saliva ) . - ( Aim 3 ) : Determine effect initial self-hypnotic relaxation distress upcoming subsequent surgery woman proven breast cancer . When patient return surgery biopsy reveal malignant cell , give questionnaire assess degree perceive stress , anxiety , preoccupation upcoming surgery . Comparison among group show durability initial hypnotic intervention . The researcher hypothesize : - Self-hypnotic relaxation reduces pain anxiety large core breast biopsy - Self-hypnotic relaxation time biopsy reduces post-biopsy stress - Teaching patient cop skill critical time breast biopsy reduce patient ' distress upcoming breast surgery . Upon completion , short periprocedural self-hypnotic intervention validate rigorous practical assessment 240 patient . The relative performance self-hypnotic relaxation know compare standard care empathic control well-characterized population patient standardize biopsy wound . The durability intervention give early possible moment breast cancer diagnosis establish . This open way future study design address long-term effect health behavior psycho-physiologic phenomenon .</detailed_description>
