	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Litx™ treatment safe effective treat inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Litx™ integrate treatment system comprise intravenously administer photosensitizing agent , Talaporfin Sodium ( LS11 ) , activate non-coherent light generate inside tumor implant light emit diode ( LED ) array light source .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tumor Ablation With Talaporfin Sodium Interstitial Light Emitting Diodes Treating Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects provide Informed Consent satisfy Eligibility Criteria undergo CT Ultrasound guide percutaneous placement single , two , three , four Light Sources depend tumor characteristic . No four Light Sources use single treatment session . The Light Sources may use single lesion multiple lesion . Depending lesion size , one Light Sources may use treat single lesion . Following ultrasound CT confirmation Light Sources , patient receive intravenous dose LS11 1 mg/kg . 15 minute 1 hour follow completion LS11 administration , delivery 200 J/cm light energy 20 mW/cm begin . Upon completion light treatment , Light Sources manually remove patient observe acute complication . Subjects evaluate treatment-related adverse event every scheduled clinical visit . Restaging contrast enhance spiral CT tumor evaluation , use RECIST criterion , perform Week 4 Week 8 . Subjects may receive second Litx™ treatment Week 4 Week 8 , recommend study investigator . Subjects receive second Litx™ treatment evaluate treatment-related adverse event every scheduled clinical visit . Restaging contrast enhance spiral CT tumor evaluation , use RECIST criterion , perform . The active phase protocol end 8 week last treatment receive . Following completion active phase protocol , subject monitor survival one year ( 6 , 9 12 month time point ) date study entry death , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
