	<detailed_description>Diabetes common , major health problem United States , significantly increase risk develop heart disease , lead cause death . Research study show risk heart disease increase , even `` pre-diabetes '' impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) stage , onset true diabetes . While many study show aggressive management diabetes lower risk heart disease , present time , know best treat patient impair glucose tolerance ( pre-diabetes ) prevent development heart disease . It also know range blood sugar level risk begin increase . The purpose study determine : - whether medication , target pathway involve development heart disease , decrease risk heart disease individual impair glucose tolerance ; - whether `` high '' blood sugar level measure one hour drink standard high-sugar drink associate increase risk heart disease even individual evidence diabetes pre-diabetes . The purpose Aim 1 study determine whether medication , target pathway involve development heart disease , decrease risk heart disease individual impair glucose tolerance . One hundred-twenty volunteer impair glucose tolerance 30 volunteer normal glucose tolerance ( normal blood sugar ingest standard high-sugar drink ) recruit `` Screening Impaired Glucose Tolerance '' ( SIGT ) study . The 30 volunteer normal glucose tolerance take study medication , undergo medical test determine risk heart disease begin study , participation study complete . The 120 volunteer impair glucose tolerance randomly assign one four medication take one-year period : - alpha lipoic acid ( antioxidant , dietary supplement ) ; - olmesartan ( drug use treat high blood pressure ) ; - aspirin ( anti-inflammatory drug ) ; - placebo ( inactive , `` dummy '' pill ) . Subjects impair glucose tolerance undergo medical test determine risk heart disease begin study ( begin study medication ) , 3 month intervention , end study ( 12 month enrollment ) . Test result compare subject take active medication take placebo , determine medication lead significant reduction risk development heart disease . The medical test use study currently use medical practice , include blood urine specimen , ultrasound test artery arm , insulin sensitivity test ( test effectively body use sugar ) . All visit test conduct General Clinical Research Centers Emory University Hospital Grady Memorial Hospital . The purpose Aim 2 study determine whether `` high '' blood sugar level measure one hour drink standard high-sugar drink ( 1-hour blood sugar level ) associate increase risk heart disease even individual evidence diabetes pre-diabetes . Seventy-five volunteer normal glucose tolerance ( normal blood sugar ingest standard high-sugar drink ) recruit SIGT study , well 15 subject impair glucose tolerance 15 diabetes . The subject normal glucose tolerance group `` low '' , `` middle '' , `` high '' 1-hour blood sugar level . All subject undergo medical testing ( Aim 1 ) determine risk heart disease . Test result subject `` low '' , `` middle '' , `` high '' 1-hour blood sugar level compare one another , well subject IGT diabetes . If subject normal glucose tolerance `` high '' 1-hour blood sugar level find increase risk heart disease compare `` low '' 1-hour blood sugar level , 1-hour blood sugar level may provide important information regard increase risk heart disease even individual normal glucose tolerance `` high '' 1-hour blood sugar level - population otherwise would identify current standard test use diagnosis diabetes pre-diabetes . Over 40 million Americans pre-diabetes ( impaired glucose tolerance ) , associate increase risk development diabetes heart disease . Findings study provide important insight pathway lead development heart disease relate pre-diabetes , prevention heart disease pre-diabetic population , identification individual high risk heart disease earlier natural history - even onset pre-diabetes .</detailed_description>
