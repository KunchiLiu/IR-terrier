	<brief_title>A Study Assess Efficacy Tadalafil Treat Erectile Dysfunction After Radiotherapy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer become frequent malignancy old men Western country . Radiotherapy common treatment modality early stage prostate cancer .

Oral drug therapy represent first-line management option patient ED . The result study complete thus far sildenafil show phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor safe efficacious drug treatment post-radiation ED .
