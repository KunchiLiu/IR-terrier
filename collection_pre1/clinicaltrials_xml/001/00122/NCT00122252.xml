	<brief_title>Biological Imaging Optimising Clinical Target Volume ( CTV ) Gross Tumour Volume ( GTV ) Contouring Prostate Cancer Improve Possibilities Intensity Modulated RadioTherapy ( IMRT ) Dose Escalation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proposal : To investigate possibility improve Clinical Target Volume ( CTV ) Gross Tumour Volume ( GTV ) delineation use late biological imaging modality 15 patient prostate cancer . Our ultimate goal set new GTV CTV definition redefine choice irradiation margin Intensity Modulated RadioTherapy ( IMRT ) prostate cancer . Furthermore , try translate functional imaging data Tomotherapy IMRT plan . Rationale : Treatment result standard dose external beam irradiation locally advanced prostate cancer insufficient . According RTOG-8531 , RTOG-8610 EORTC series T1 T4 tumour , 5-year overall survival range 60 - 73 % 5-year disease free survival range 15 - 67 % . Local control enhance adjuvant androgen suppression , 5-year disease free survival increase significantly 36 - 89 % . Unfortunately , androgen suppression significantly deteriorate quality life . Increasing irradiation dose also improve local control . However , local toxicity , especially rectal bladder complication , restrict dose give conformal external beam irradiation population base uncertainty margin . Setup inaccuracy organ movement determine irradiation margin need . Modern position verification technique , e.g . use fiducial marker prostate combination megavoltage image technique , allow reduction margin offer possibility dose escalation prostate . Studies IMRT utilise sophisticated position verification technique approach appear feasible . A reduction margin , thus possible increase irradiation dose , expect improve delineation prostate contour . Imaging perform delineate anatomic structure biological process within intraprostatic malignant lesion . CT commonly use anatomy delineation , base early study . Although image quality improve gradually , unfortunately , CT still severely overestimates prostate volume . Furthermore , Teh et al find 712 prostatectomy patient large mean difference CT-based estimate GTV PTV Pathological Prostate Volume ( PPV ) . Rasch et al find average ratio CT MRI volumes 1.4 . Also MRI technique improve produce much well image quality , e.g . increase Tesla , use present phased array coil use thinner slice thickness . The accuracy detect extracapsular extension prostate carcinoma endorectal phased-array coil MR imaging reach 77 % experienced reader . Concluding , MRI superior CT GTV contouring , MRI alone ( use combine T1 SE T2 TSE ) may sufficient visualisation GTV . It expect biological imaging improve GTV delineation . Within GTV Biological Target Volume ( BTV ) become visible , may improve efficacy cancer radiotherapy . In biological imaging use different image technique yet explore . Currently , two topic importance . The first topic perfusion . In prostate cancer , degree vascularisation appear correlate aggressive behaviour risk metastasis . In prostate cancer approximately two time many microvessels exist malignant tissue compare normal tissue . Furthermore , benign tissue capillary restrict part periglandular stroma immediately adjacent epithelium , whereas distribution carcinoma appear random . Differences perfusion show correlate active prostate cancer area . Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI able show microvessel density ( MVD ) prostate . Second metabolic activity prostate cancer . The ratio choline creatine ( normal value 0.22 +/- 0.13 ppm ) reveal metabolic active prostate cancer tissue . Increased choline and/or reduce citrate indicate prostate cancer . The ratio choline creatine-to citrate relate Gleason score tumour . Concluding , MRI MRS allow combine structural metabolic evaluation prostate cancer location , aggressiveness stage . The could perform use combined CT PET . Sutinen et al find clear evidence detect area [ 11C ] choline prostate cancer use PET . To knowledge data exist compare [ 11C ] choline PET MRS prostate cancer . The technology biological imaging remain evolution , continue advance accuracy expect . Therefore , give current inadequacy state art define GTV CTV prostate cancer , propose study prostate visualisation use late anatomical biological ( metabolic ) image modality . Combining information different imaging technique introduce BTV image fusion likely improve CTV GTV delineation . This allow u redefine choice margin . Finally , result improve IMRT plan , dose paint dose escalation GTV ultimate goal . This comply current opinion radiation development . Progress functional imaging likely provide tool require individualised risk-adapted radiotherapy . By introduce BTV within GTV non-uniform CTV delineation use thus margin minimise . This allow escalation dose . Setup inaccuracy organ movement determine irradiation margin need . Therefore , control day day position variability together delivery optimise conformal irradiation next goal set . Helical Tomotherapy novel approach delivery radiation cancer treatment , able . It rely 6 MV linear accelerator treatment purpose 3.5 MV-CT scan imaging purpose . Both mount ring gantry rotate around patient advance ring . A 64-leaf collimator defines radiation fan beam . In theoretical study Helical Tomotherapy plan require minimal operator interaction result excellent spar normal structure prostate IMRT . Therefore , study also propose fuse anatomic biologic image data Tomotherapy MV-CT make inverse IMRT Tomotherapy plan . This planning exercise precede feasibility study functional imaging individualised day day adapt radiotherapy Tomotherapy . Hypotheses : - It possible , use biological ( MRS ) image data anatomical ( CT MRI ) image data , define BTV within GTV . - By introduce BTV within GTV non-uniform CTV delineation use margin minimise . - It possible translate fuse anatomic biologic image data clinically sufficient Tomotherapy IMRT plan . Patients method : Patients receive external beam irradiation prostate cancer ( Stage T1-4 N0/x M0 ) , preferably treat anti-androgens without metal hip prosthesis approach participate pilot study . The study perform 15 patient receive image additionally irradiation treatment . Before start treatment patient receive 3T MRI ( T1 SE T2 TSE ) , MRS determine choline creatine level prostate . Furthermore , MV-CT make prelude future position verification study . All image ( CT , MRI MRS ) match . These combine data use determine optimal Tomotherapy IMRT plan . Patients treat accord current department protocol . This study image / treatment planning study . No change treatment make base obtained image data set . The risk patient negligible . From MV-CT approximately 1 cGy . The MRI perform without contrast ( dynamic gadolinium enhance MRI evaluate perfusion distribution ) limit patient burden risk . Regarding total irradiation dose 7200 till 8200 cGy patient additional risk negligible . The current waiting time patient start radiotherapy approximately 5 6 week . In wait time image study perform , participation study result treatment delay patient . The MV-CT scan take approximately 30 minute perform combine MRI/MRS approximately 1 hour . The Cross Cancer Institute Edmonton facilitate necessary image technique : 3T MRI , MRS Helical Tomotherapy Unit ( TomoTherapy Inc. , Madison ) . It necessary determine specificity accuracy image modality . The imaging meant assist determine metabolic anatomic tumour area prostate . Missing tumour part problem yet whole prostate treat minimal require dose . Overdosage prostate tissue clinical problem .</detailed_description>
