	<brief_title>A Culturally Sensitive Values-Guided Aid End Life Decision-Making</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : End-of-life decision-making important aspect provide quality healthcare , especially elderly population . Increasingly , appropriateness many decision question . Some invasive procedure do seriously ill patient significantly alter course , many patient die without pain symptom address , family may feel dissatisfied care provide . Additionally , strike racial/ethnic disparity end-of-life care . Objectives : The explicit identification value guide medical decision-making could improve decision-making process end-of-life care patient races/ethnicities . 1 ) We directly compare , critically assess , revise two Values Histories basis qualitative data derive individual interview racially/ethnically diverse patient surrogate , explore patient ' , surrogate ' , physician ' value , preference concern guide decision-making medical intervention end-of-life . 2 ) We adapt exist Values Histories clinically practical tool , Values Inventory discussion aid . 3 ) We conduct preliminary test tool use physician-patient physician-surrogate encounter improve facilitate decision end-of-life care . Methods : To complete Objective 3 conduct pilot randomize trial develop Values Inventory discussion aid test feasibility use clinical practice . This clinicaltrials.gov number applies Objective 3 IIR-02-224 ( complete study mixed-methods study several different arm enrollment goal ) . Eligible patient risk 6-12-month mortality one follow diagnosis : congestive heart failure , ejection fraction le 25 % ; severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema dependence oxygen ; chronic liver disease cirrhosis ascites ; colon carcinoma liver metastasis ; non-small cell cancer lung , stage III IV , patient chronic kidney disease renal replacement therapy , previous hospitalization . All ( patient ) participant age 55 year older recruit clinics/wards Houston VAMC . Surrogates surrogates patient condition ; physician generalists medical subspecialists . All participant African American , Hispanic , White , reflect 3 major races/ethnicities Houston VAMC .</detailed_description>
