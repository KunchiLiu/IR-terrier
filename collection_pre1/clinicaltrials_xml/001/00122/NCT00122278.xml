	<detailed_description>Parenteral Corticosteroids Adjuvant Therapy Migraine Headaches : A. Overview/Aims : Five million Americans present emergency department ( ED ) annually headaches [ 1 ] . The majority patient migraine headache [ 2,3 ] . Parenteral medication proven benefit acute migraine include triptans [ 4 ] , dopamine-receptor antagonist [ 5-11 ] , non-steroidals [ 12 ] , dihydroergotamine [ 13 ] . Although distinct class medication often effective treatment acute migraine , use complicate treatment failure [ 4,9,14 ] , recurrence headache [ 15,16 ] , side effect [ 17 ] , concern patient migraine [ 18 ] . The ideal medication , would rapidly alleviate migraine pain without recurrence pain side effect , yet identify . The role corticosteroid acute migraine ill-defined . Although used patient intractable migraine , class medication widely use typical migraine attack . However , limited clinical data suggest corticosteroid decrease rate recurrent headache [ 19-21 ] might decrease pain acute attack [ 22 ] . Further research need define role corticosteroid ED treatment acute migraine headache . Specific Aim : The specific aim study determine efficacy ten milligrams parenteral dexamethasone adjuvant therapy emergency department treatment migraine headache . Primary Hypothesis : Twenty four hour medication administration , great percentage migraine subject receive dexamethasone : - sustain pain-free headache relief ; - headache-related functional impairment compare subject receive placebo . Both group also receive standard care . Secondary Hypothesis : Two hour medication administration , great percentage migraine subject receive dexamethasone headache pain-free , compare subject receive placebo . B . Background Significance : Despite standard treatment , large percentage emergency migraineurs continue suffer headache ED discharge . Recurrent persistent headache rat moderate severe intensity occur 14-43 % subject 24 hour discharge ED-based migraine clinical trial [ 20,23,24 ] . In Canadian population , 45 % headache patient report headache-related functional impairment within 24 hour ED discharge [ 16 ] . Some report indicate corticosteroid decrease rate intensity recurrent migraine headache [ 19-21 ] . However , investigator could find corticosteroid clinical trial use recommended measure outcomes [ 25 ] migraine population . To best knowledge , control clinical trial test efficacy corticosteroid primary migraine-abortive therapy . Although pathogenesis migraine headache incompletely understood , sterile neurogenic inflammation felt key pain generate pathway occur acute migraine [ 15 ] . Corticosteroids theoretically mitigate inflammation decrease pain duration acute migraine attack . One dose intravenous dexamethasone well-tolerated migraineurs [ 20 ] . If medication prove efficacy migraine , would represent substantial contribution headache medicine , effective tool armamentarium emergency physician , cheap safe method decrease pain suffer ED migraine patient . C. Methods : C1 . Overview : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical research trial test efficacy intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate adjuvant therapy acute migraine headache . All subject receive standard-of-care migraine-abortive medication migraine . In addition , receive either ten milligram intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate comparable amount placebo . Subjects follow telephone 24 hour medication administration . C2 . Study Sites : Study site include emergency department Montefiore Medical Center , Jacobi Medical Center , New York Presbyterian Hospital , St. Luke 's Medical Center , Bellevue Medical Center , Kings County Medical Center . C3 . Selection Participants : The attend emergency physician refer adult patient present chief complaint headache regular hour data collector . Under supervision site investigator , data collector inform patient study ask consent participate study human subject . The data collector include study patient migraine headache define International Headache Society ( IHS-2003 1.1 migraine without aura ; 1.2 migraine aura ) . Patients also include IHS probable migraine ( IHS-2003 1.6.1 &amp; 1.6.2 ) [ 26 ] last 72 168 hour . In word , patient also include headache meet IHS migraine criterion except duration headache 73 168 hour . These probable migraine patient include represent substantial subset ED primary headache patient ( Friedman , et . al. , unpublished data ) majority patient disable probable migraine history similar headache respond migraine-specific medication [ 27 ] . Patients exclude emergency physician intend perform lumbar puncture ED lumbar puncture independent association 24 hour headache pain score . Patients exclude persistent objective focal neurologic deficit , determine attend physician , fear mistake stroke complicate migraine , sign symptom concern cause malignant secondary headache meningitis , subarachnoid hemorrhage , carotid dissection , intracranial mass . Patients also exclude temperature great 100.3 degree , pregnancy lactation , allergy intolerance study medication . Patients enroll . Patients age 64 exclude , fear increase risk adverse reaction study medication increase risk secondary headache . Patients meet enrollment criterion basic demographic headache variable record . C4 . Randomization Blinding : Randomization do research pharmacist Montefiore Medical Center block six use computer generate random number table available online . The randomization stratify study site . In order determine random number table , pharmacist insert medication vial place vial sequentially number brown paper research bag . The research bag distribute express courier batch six investigator site . The research bag store site lock location accessible data collector . When subject identify , content research bag administer clinical nurse . Assignment know research pharmacist . However , assignment accompany research bag , seal small manila envelope , case medical emergency mandate assignment reveal . C5 . Measures : C5a . Categorical Scale : As primary measure , trial use four point descriptive scale recommend use migraine research [ 25 ] . On scale , subject ask characterize migraine pain `` none , mild , moderate severe '' . C5b . Disability Scale : A descriptive categorical scale use characterize subject 's headache-related disability . On scale , subject describe disability `` 1 ) none ; 2 ) mildly impaired ( little bit difficulty I usually ) ; 3 ) moderately impaired ( great deal difficulty I usually minor activity ) ; 4 ) severely impaired ( require bed rest ) '' [ 25 ] . C5c . Numerical Rating Scale Pain : An 11-point verbal numerical rating scale pain secondary measurement tool trial . On scale , subject ask describe pain number zero ten , zero pain ten worst pain imaginable . This scale show perform comparably visual analog scale , easy administer [ 28 ] . C6.Outcomes : The primary outcome percentage subject achieve maintain `` headache pain free '' state . Persistent `` headache pain free '' recommend outcome migraine clinical research [ 25 ] . Subjects consider fulfilled primary outcome achieve pain free state ED maintain throughout 24 hour period receive study medication . The alternate primary outcome number subject report headache-related disability period time ED discharge . The major secondary outcome percentage subject report `` headache pain-free '' status two hour medication administration . Other secondary outcome include rate sustain headache relief ( moderate severe pain become maintain level mild none ) , two-hour NRS change ( NRSbaseline-NRS2hours ) , 24 hour NRS change ( NRSbaseline-NRS24hours ) , need rescue medication two hour , need analgesic medication discharge ED , associate symptom ( specifically : weakness , drowsiness , dizziness ) , unscheduled visit medical provider within 24 hour medication administration , percentage patient answer affirmatively question `` Do want receive medication next time come ED ? '' C7 . Data Collection , Data Entry , Back-Up : Data entry follow-up subject accomplish take advantage research infrastructure place Department Emergency Medicine Albert Einstein College Medicine . Five full-time research assistants one research clerk fund department . The research assistants medical technician level , full-time employee extensive clinical research experience pass require research ethic course . These research assistants staff Montefiore ED operational hour . The initial data collection process perform data collector individual site . These data collector different ED , depend resource individual ED . At Montefiore Jacobi , data collector salaried , train , technician level employee , pass require research ethic course . The data collector train particular study principal investigator site investigator . Their training include mock patient encounter . The data collector use standardize data collection instrument collect baseline information , pain score , side effect ED . After ED data obtain , data collection instrument photocopy faxed dedicate research clerk Department Emergency Medicine Albert Einstein College Medicine . The receive fax machine private fax machine secure office behind two locked door . The research clerk responsible obtain 24 hour follow-up information . At time pre-arranged subject prior subject 's discharge ED , research clerk call subject obtain 24 hour follow-up information reading question data collection instrument . Twenty-four hour follow-up do non-business hour perform Montefiore 's research assistant , cover ED 24 hour day , seven day every week . These research assistant retrieve fax data collection instrument , obtain follow-up information , return data collection instrument research clerk . The research clerk enter data SPSS data entry V.11 . Completed data collection instrument send second research clerk enter data second time SPSS program . After every ten subject enter , data back stored three different computer two distinct campus . Prior analysis , two data set compare . Discrepancies correct use initial data collection instrument source . The original version data collection instrument keep locked cabinet original site . C8 . Medications : In addition study medication placebo , subject receive standard migraine abortive therapy . The optimal migraine-abortive/analgesic medication ED patient acute migraine headache yet define , investigator choose intravenous metoclopramide , effective , safe , widely-available , economical dopamine receptor antagonist , migraine treatment trial . Parenteral dopamine-antagonists recommend use ED29 use commonly triptans ED set [ 1,16 ] . Metoclopramide show least effective subcutaneous sumatriptan reduce pain [ 7,8 ] comparable two hour activity limitation [ 30 ] . The investigator use 20 milligram intravenous metoclopramide , moderate dose compare previous work [ 23,30 ] . In addition metoclopramide , subject also receive 25mg diphenhydramine prevent akathisias extra-pyramidal reaction metoclopramide [ 31 ] . This combination metoclopramide diphenhydramine commonly use ED set cause significant drowsiness impairment activity migraineurs two hour [ 30 ] . The investigator view potential anti-migraine effect diphenhydramine [ 32 ] add benefit subject . Metoclopramide , diphenhydramine , study medication place 50cc bag normal saline administer slow intravenous drip twenty minute . Subjects require rescue medication persistent headache receive another 20mg intravenous metoclopramide . This additional dose metoclopramide part ED-based protocol demonstrate high rate pain relief patient satisfaction minimum side effect [ 23,30 ] . Subjects require pain medication receive combination ibuprofen oral opiate discretion treat physician . All subject discharge ED two 400mg tablet ibuprofen take needed recurrence headache . Ibuprofen effective migraine treatment [ 9 ] . C9 . Interim Analysis , Stopping Rules Sample Size Calculation : An interim analysis perform detect overwhelming superiority intervention . A data monitoring committee convene 126 subject enrol . The committee look statistically significant difference primary outcome discrepancy rate adverse effect ( measure rate hospitalization presume adverse reaction medication ) . The medication use study well-known medical community commonly use . Neither disease medication cause mortality significant permanent disability . Therefore , although investigator monitor adverse effect occur trial , anticipate significant effect outcome . There many different approach calculation significance criterion use interim analysis , thus might use terminate trial complete data collect . The investigator choose intermediate approach , base O'Brien-Fleming procedure [ 33 ] set interim test criterion 0.01 , final test criterion 0.04 . Using criterion significance 0.04 2-tailed test , study require 100 subject group , total 200 subject , power 80 % yield statistically significant result . This computation assume difference persistent headache pain-free proportion 0.20 , specifically , 0.30 versus 0.50 ( rate persistent headache pain-free 24 hour ED discharge previous similarly-dosed metoclopramide trial 30 % [ 30 ] ) . The clinical effect seek comparable number need treat five , large number need treat believe important discover self-limited disease process . The interim analysis adequate power ( 0.80 ) discover statistically significant difference ( alpha=0.01 ) difference two group 30 % ( .60 versus .30 ) . C10 . Co-Variates : The following variable assess : C10a . Cutaneous Allodynia : Cutaneous allodynia felt marker intractable migraine [ 34 ] test lightly rub 4 x 4 piece gauze face subject [ 35 ] . The data collector assess subject cutaneous allodynia prior administration medication . C10b . Duration Headache : Although likely collinear allodynia , co-variate might associate intractable 24 hour headache [ 20 ] . C10c . Pre-Medication : In previous work , although 25 % investigator ' population take analgesic medication prior presentation ED , co-variate confound association study medication persistent pain-free [ 30 ] . Nevertheless , investigator record migraine-relevant medication use subject prior ED presentation , group class , determine co-variate relationship primary outcome . C11d . Aura : The investigator know document association aura corticosteroid , subject inadequately explore . C11e . Prophylactic Medications : In previous work [ 30 ] , small minority ED migraineurs prophylactic medication . However , patient represent sub-set migraineurs severe disease . C11f . Chronic Migraines : Only small minority ED migraineurs classify chronic ( Friedman , unpublished data ) . However , patient represent sub-set migraineurs high risk recurrent 24 hour headache . C11g . Medication-Rebound Headaches : This diagnosis inadequately explore ED set consists complicate headache patient . The investigator exclude patient study likely benefit intervention [ 21 ] . C11h . Site : To account site-specific difference influence result , subject site randomized block six prevent unequal representation particular site either arm . This prevent one site overly influence study . C11i . Race/Ethnicity : This base subject 's report . The significance co-variate study unknown . C11j . Age : This record . The significance co-variate study unknown . C12k.Gender : This record . The significance co-variate study unknown . C12 . Analysis : The data analyze `` intention-to-treat '' manner . Once patient randomize receives dexamethasone , pain score include 24-hour analysis regardless whether receive rescue medication complete protocol . However , lost-to-follow-up subject exclude primary analysis ( sensitivity analysis conduct lost-to-follow-up subject assume poor outcome ) . Study enrollment continue pre-determined number subject complete primary endpoint . Chi-square analysis use compare rate . Students t-tests use compare mean difference pain score . Multivariate regression model use analyze influence co-variates discuss , particularly allodynia , duration headache , use medication prior ED presentation . Briefly , evidence confound seek look association heterogeneous variable independent ( study medication ) dependent ( pain status ) variable . Between-group difference express mean proportion , bound 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) . References : 1 . Vinson DR . Treatment pattern isolated benign headache US emergency department .
