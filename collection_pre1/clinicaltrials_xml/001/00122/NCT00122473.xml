	<brief_title>Imatinib Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans ( DFSP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim investigate efficacy imatinib ( Glivec ) treatment primary locally relapse dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ( DFSP ) . DFSP cutaneous neoplasm well know overexpression platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) . Herein , imatinib provide systemic treatment option offer possibility reduction wide surgical margin use today surgery primary DFSP , even complete avoidance surgical treatment disease . Since imatinib exerts function via interference protein tyrosine kinase activity , inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGF-R ) signal cascade play crucial role pathogenesis tumor growth DFSP . Since imatinib show shrink metastatic lesion DFSP , strong rationale expect also decrease cell proliferation tumor growth primary DFSP .</detailed_description>
