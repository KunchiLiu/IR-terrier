	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Major innovation radiotherapy ( RT ) delivery ( 3D conformal RT , intensity modulate RT ) permit RT dose escalation test mean improve control localized prostate cancer . With delivery innovation , severe toxicity occur rarely , significant bladder rectal toxicity common . The investigator study cohort 98 patient receive dose-escalated 3D-CRT obtain evidence dosimetric factor underlie rectal toxicity . They posit late radiation toxicity disease state significant genetic determinant . These determinant neither understood accounted selection treatment , investigator propose study well-characterized cohort , clinically well disease control perspective , give comprehensive dosimetric outcome information available . HYPOTHESIS : Comprehensive analysis genomic , proteomic , dosimetric characteristic patient prostate cancer provide novel understanding genetic predisposition cellular tissue response irradiation result clinical occurrence significant chronic rectal bladder injury 3D-CRT . APPROACH : For thorough understanding molecular process underlie tissue response radiation damage , investigator propose genomic analysis . Their working hypothesis rectal bladder toxicity correlate patient genetics measure single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) select group gene . The criterion select SNPs base evidence various gene implicate demonstrated DNA repair pathways radiation-induced tissue damage . In addition , since radiation injury consider phenotypic tissue response RT genetically predispose individual , investigator examine protein profile `` signature '' serum patient suffer significant toxicity . Analysis data unique investigator use statistically base bioinformatics approach , biophysical modeling . This proposal represent comprehensive exploration date concept molecular `` signature '' normal tissue radiation injury applicant aware . SPECIFIC AIM 1 : - To create database SNPs among long-term prostate cancer survivor treat 3D-CRT , detail toxicity , quality life dosimetric information available ; - To assess feasibility use bioinformatics approach database examine possibility specific SNPs , context know dosimetric factor , predict occurrence late rectal bladder toxicity ; - To perform proteomic analysis serum sample cohort 25 patient experience high level ongoing late toxicity 50 patient ongoing late toxicity . SPECIFIC AIM 2 : - To utilize biophysical approach model clinical complication data , use concept generalize mean biological effective dose ( GMBED ) critical volume model . SUMMARY : This proposal first comprehensive retrospective analysis genomic , proteomic dosimetric determinant late radiation injury prostate cancer . The investigator assemble broad array expertise CCI PolyomX program ( high throughput SNP facility western Canada ) , NCI/FDA Clinical Proteomics Program Bethesda , MD , unique biophysical modeling capability CBIAR researcher reach goal .</detailed_description>
