This endoluminal route infection prevent extent antibiotic solution instill catheter long enough time regular basis . However , avoid resistance occurring , use antibiotic infection prevention remain exceptional . The use non-toxic antiseptic might well alternative . Recently , use alcohol lock solution suggest promising way prevent CRBSI compatibility polyurethane silicone catheter submerge alcohol solution publicize biomechanical structural change detect 9 week immersion .

	<detailed_description>In modern-day medicine , use intravascular catheter become unavoidable . In United States , hospital clinic purchase 150 million intravascular device year 5 million central venous catheter . However , use come without risk . It put patient danger mechanical , thrombotic infectious complication ( catheter-related infection [ CRI ] ) , important catheter-related bloodstream infection ( CRBSI ) . CRBSI associate significant increase hospital stay , therefore , cost patient management , morbidity probably also mortality . The increase expense estimate 15,965 US dollar per patient CRBSI 1994 even 56,167 US dollar another recent study . It clear prevention CRI utmost importance help decrease patient suffer well cost patient management . Extensive detailed evidence-based recommendation prevention CRI recently publish . However , many topic remain unresolved still urgent need effective , cheap easy implement preventive measure without risk develop antibiotic resistance . Catheters become colonized microorganisms exoluminal ( catheter insertion site ) endoluminal ( hub infusates ) route . It show , longer catheter remain place , important endoluminal route becomes . The endoluminal route infection prevent extent antibiotic solution instill catheter long enough time regular basis . However , avoid resistance occurring , use antibiotic lock infection prevention remain exceptional . Although evidence support concept , methodologically appropriate clinical data use antiseptic solution purpose still await . Recently , use alcohol lock solution suggest promising way prevent CRBSI compatibility polyurethane silicone catheter submerge alcohol solution publicize biomechanical structural change detect 9 week immersion . The major advantage alcohol lock solution would broad antimicrobial spectrum without risk compromise future antibiotic treatment , contrast use antibiotic lock , development antibiotic resistance concern . Furthermore would cheap universally available . In randomised study efficacy 70 % alcohol lock solution prevention CRBSI compare placebo apply 15 minute per day .</detailed_description>
