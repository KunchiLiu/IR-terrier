	<detailed_description>Major innovation radiotherapy ( RT ) delivery ( 3D conformal RT , intensity modulate RT ) permit RT dose escalation test mean improve disease control many tumour site . With delivery innovation , life-threatening toxicity occur rarely , significant clinical toxicity common . In previous work investigator study cohort 98 prostate patient receive dose-escalated 3D-CRT obtain evidence genetic dosimetric factor underlie rectal/bladder toxicity . They posit late radiation toxicity disease state significant genetic determinant malignancy . These determinant neither understood accounted selection treatment , investigator propose study additional well-characterized cohort , clinically well disease control perspective , give comprehensive dosimetric outcome information available . For thorough understanding molecular process underlie tissue response radiation damage , investigator propose genomic analysis . Their working hypothesis normal organ toxicity associate patient genetics measure single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) select group gene . The criterion select SNPs base candidate gene approach , choose gene implicate demonstrated DNA repair pathways radiation-induced tissue damage/tissue homeostasis . Analysis data use statistically base bioinformatics approach .</detailed_description>
