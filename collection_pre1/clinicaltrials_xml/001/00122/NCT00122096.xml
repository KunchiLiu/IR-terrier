	<detailed_description>Surgery initiate complex cascade event involve release nociceptive compound nerve ending damage tissue lead inflammatory hyperalgesic response . COX-2 inhibitor often use treat pain . This double-blind randomized study surgical patient receive spinal drain surgical purpose . The hypothesis valdecoxib reach therapeutic concentration CSF , decrease plasma CSF concentration inflammatory mediator . Subjects receive valdecoxib 40 mg placebo approximately 1 hr prior surgery . Serial blood CSF sample obtain . Valdecoxib cytokine concentration measure .</detailed_description>
