	<detailed_description>Traditionally , clinical pharmacogenetic study begin identify know phenotype ( e.g. , aberrant response drug ) follow isolate variant protein gene responsible phenotype . With sequence human gene know , possible carry pharmacogenetic study reverse manner ( i.e. , genotype phenotype ) . Patients know variant gene study response certain drug , help elucidate importance gene drug response . In proposed study , plan use genotype phenotype strategy study role OAT3 related variant drug response . Renal elimination anionic drug occur filtration active secretion . For secretion , drug transport blood renal tubular cell basolateral membrane . This transport occur concentration electrochemical gradient , must therefore mediate organic anion transporter ( OATs ) . To date , six human OATs identify , OAT 1-5 , OAT7 . OAT1 OAT3 dominant OATs find basolateral aspect renal proximal tubular cell hence suspect play significant role renal anionic drug elimination [ 3 , 4 ] . Active renal tubular secretion beta-lactam antibiotic , include cephalosporin , long recognize , OATs likely play major role , though relative role unclear [ 5 ] . In vivo study demonstrate cephalosporin cefotaxime ten-fold high affinity OAT3 OAT1 [ 6 ] . Thus , patient OAT3 variant would expect exhibit altered renal secretion cefotaxime . Cefotaxime common cephalosporin use treatment bacterial infection . Dosed 1-2 mg every 6-8 hour , show safe patient normal renal function . Cefotaxime give intravenously , metabolize desacetyl cefotaxime ( DACM ) retain antibacterial activity . DACM metabolize two inactive metabolite , M2 M3 ; four form cefotaxime renally eliminate , active secretion represent significant percentage total clearance ( 44 % cefotaxime , 64 % DACM ) [ 7 ] . The half-life cefotaxime DACM 1 1.5 hour , respectively . Patients poorly functional OAT3 relate variant might expect exhibit reduce tubular secretion cefotaxime metabolite , result high prolong blood level . Because variant may reduce amount cefotaxime enters tubular cell , may also associate reduced incidence cephalosporin-induced nephrotoxicity . The PMT group collection 500 DNA sample young , healthy adult four major ethnic group ( 125 Caucasians , African-Americans , Mexicans , Chinese ) . This collection ( The Pharmacogenetics Membrane Transporters ) , refer `` SOPHIE '' ( Study Pharmacogenetics Ethnically-diverse Populations ) , include volunteer consent call back consideration enrollment future study . In recent study , identify nine non-synonymous OAT3 variant among subject participate SOPHIE study . We clone introduce variant heterologous expression system test encoded transporter ability transport estrone sulfate ( documented substrate OAT3 ) . Four variant identify result complete loss function : F129L ( one Hispanic subject ) , R149S ( Caucasian African American subject ) , Q239stop ( African American subject ) , R277W ( Asian subject ) . In subject two non-functional variant , unknown whether variant occur chromosome , variant different chromosome . The latter would potentially make subject completely OAT3 deficient . An additional variant ( I305F ) show reduced transport ability , , OAT3 substrates identify three Asian one Hispanic subject . One variant ( A310V ) show increase transport estrone sulfate compare common allele identify single Caucasian subject . This study address follow question : Do individual carry altered-function OAT3 related variant exhibit difference pharmacokinetics cefotaxime comparison individual carry common allele ?</detailed_description>
