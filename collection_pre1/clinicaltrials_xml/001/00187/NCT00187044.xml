	<detailed_description>This research study evaluate safety vaccine protect people HIV infection . Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) cause AIDS ( Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ) . AIDS one serious viral infection time . It believe person contract HIV eventually develop AIDS . Because , try develop new way prevent infection HIV . Vaccines successful prevent decreasing symptom number viral infection hepatitis B , polio , measles . Viral vaccine work cause person 's immune system make antibody immune cell virus `` respond '' virus . Because success viral infection , scientist try develop successful vaccine HIV . The vaccine test study prepare small part HIV . The part HIV use vaccine `` envelope '' coat part virus . Because one part virus use vaccine , vaccine cause HIV infection . The `` envelope '' part HIV put another virus , vaccinia virus . The vaccinia virus use vaccine many decade million people vaccine eliminate disease know smallpox ( i.e . smallpox vaccine ) . The smallpox vaccine license effective vaccine . Making new vaccine put part different virus smallpox vaccine ( also know vaccinia virus ) call `` recombinant '' vaccinia virus vaccine . Our new recombinant vaccine product call PolyEnv1 . In study , researcher evaluate well vaccine tolerate , much vaccine give , determine side effect occur response vaccination .</detailed_description>
