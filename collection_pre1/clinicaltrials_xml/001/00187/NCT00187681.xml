	<brief_title>Organic Cation Transporter 1 ( OCT1 ) , Response Metformin Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In propose study , address two question : •Do individual carry one OCT1 variant reduce function exhibit difference pharmacokinetics metformin comparison individual carry common allele ? Compared wild type mouse , Oct1-/- mouse reduce metformin distribution liver intestine . We expect similar pattern person carry variant OCT1 allele carry common allele . This effect might reflect difference Tmax Cmax oral administration metformin . Other difference metformin pharmacokinetic property volume distribution , half life clearance may also evident . •Do individual carry decrease non-functional variant exhibit difference response metformin comparison individual carry common allele ? Specially , test hypothesis OCT1-expressing tissue target organ metformin , individual variant transporter may reduce metformin uptake site ( correct meaning ? ) therefore reduce drug response metformin . In study , evaluate metformin pharmacokinetics glucose metabolic effect healthy subject rather patient type 2 diabetes . Our rationale follow . The hepatic glucose production diabetic patient abnormally increase . Metformin decrease fast blood glucose concentration reduce hepatic glucose production improve glucose utilization . However , fast blood glucose concentration decrease metformin non-diabetics normal hepatic glucose production . It suggest glucose-lowering effect metformin difficult demonstrate non-diabetics unless glucose concentration artificially raise . Although study show metformin improves glucose tolerance non-diabetics diabetic , result non-diabetics inconsistent , depend variable experimental condition . Variation OCT1 expression activity may one variable , time point blood sample drug glucose ( meal ) intake may also important observe glucose-lowering effect [ 16 ] . In study , employ similar study design report [ 16 ] observe glucose-lowering effect metformin healthy subject . Before metformin administration , oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) conduct . We expect difference glucose tolerance different OCT1 genotype , hypothesis individual different OCT1 genotype different metformin concentration target tissue , hence different glucose uptake ( utilization ) target tissue ( primary muscle liver ) . In non-diabetic healthy subject , metformin significantly attenuate rise immediate postprandial insulin level . In study , also determine insulin level glucose administration . With metformin treatment , expect observe significant difference post-glucose-administration insulin level individual different OCT1 genotype . When mouse give metformin , blood lactate concentration significantly increase wild-type mouse , whereas slight increase observe Oct1-/- mouse . This consistent hypothesis OCT1 determinant metformin effect glucose utilization . It interest compare plasma lactate concentration metformin treatment individual different OCT1 genotype . Metformin improve lipid metabolism obese diabetic patient , reflect reduced plasma level free fatty acid , cholesterol , triglyceride . However , study single dose metformin , may possible observe effect healthy subject , although corresponding concentration measure .</detailed_description>
