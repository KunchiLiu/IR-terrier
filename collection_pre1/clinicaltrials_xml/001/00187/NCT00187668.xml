	<detailed_description>DNA plasma use identify determine allele frequency genetic variant membrane transporter gene relevant human disease drug response , include drug metabolizing enzyme , collagen , race/ethnicity , neurovascular disease , asthma/allergy/lung disease , cardiovascular disease . This phase study serve hypothesis-generating phase future study identify genetic variant determine allele frequency among ethnically diverse cohort healthy volunteer . Future investigation ( separate IRB application ) attempt correlate genotype phenotype among cohort volunteer . The allele identification frequency data group healthy volunteer also use design association study relevant disease population . Determine identify sequence variant associated gain loss vitro biologic function use lymphocyte obtain patient .</detailed_description>
