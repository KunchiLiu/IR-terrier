	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Reduce Skin Burn Induced Breast Radiotherapy Using Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Description Problem : The majority breast cancer patient treat breast-conserving surgery follow radiotherapy , give loco-regional control rate similar mastectomy . Currently , `` standard '' breast radiotherapy technique include treatment entire breast tangential oppose pair photon beam . The standard technique lead significant acute skin toxicity , range breast erythema moist desquamation , approximately 40 % patient . This toxicity may lead interruption treatment delivery ; may increase risk develop late skin toxicity include telangiectasia , skin fibrosis chronic breast pain ; may also associate significant decrease health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) . Published data dosimetric study suggest dose variation excess 10 % within breast may important predictor acute radiation-induced skin toxicity ( RR = 9.7 ) , dose toxicity occur frequently inframamary fold . A study perform TSRCC show intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) allow significant improvement dose homogeneity within breast compare standard breast radiotherapy technique . Furthermore , hot spot 10 % see inframamary fold patient large breast volume remove . 2 . Objectives : - To determine occurence acute skin toxicity woman receive adjuvant breast radiation IMRT le frequent compare woman treat conventional technique . - To determine HRQOL score , specifically breast module subscale score , woman receive adjuvant breast radiation IMRT good HRQOL score woman receive conventional technique . - To perform comparison cost delivery breast radiotherapy use IMRT conventional technique . - To determine increase acute skin toxicity translates increase late skin toxicity . 3 . Hypothesis : We hypothesize woman receive adjuvant breast radiation IMRT significantly less acute skin toxicity improve HRQOL compare woman treat conventional technique . We also hypothesize would increase cost relate IMRT compare conventional technique . Research plan : A Phase III randomise control trial plan , block stratification breast size boost delivery . Eligible woman include referred TSRCC follow breast-conserving surgery . They randomize receive either conventional technique treatment , either breast IMRT . Acute skin toxicity assess weekly radiotherapy one month follow completion radiotherapy use previously validate RTOG acute skin toxicity scale . The occurence , duration intensity acute skin toxicity compare . HRQOL assess irradiation , use validate EORTC instrument ( EORTC QLQ-C30 QLQ-BR23 ) . 340 patient accrue order detect 15 % reduction ocurence acute skin toxicity IMRT use a=0.05 , b=0.80 .</detailed_description>
