	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis major health concern worldwide . While drug available treatment prevention osteoporosis , practical population-wide prevention effort . Demonstrating effectiveness safe widely available dietary intervention prevent osteoporosis could important public health ramification . Different food source dietary protein may different effect bone metabolism . Animal food provide dietary acid load may lead negative calcium balance increase bone resorption . In contrast , vegetable source protein , provide acid due protein content , provide proportionally base counter dietary acid load . The effect dairy product , rich animal protein also contain potential base precursor find vegetable food , establish . Finally , soy protein source may dual benefit : soy food provide base precursor well plant estrogen may beneficial effect bone . We resubmitting proposal randomize postmenopausal woman one four diet equal calorie , protein , calcium , sodium . The diet differ 80 percent protein one four source : non-dairy animal , vegetable , dairy , soy food , result significant difference among diet acid , base , isoflavone content . All food prepare provide General Clinical Research Center . The subject consume diet 6 week measurement acid-base status , isoflavone excretion , calcium metabolism . This first intervention study examine effect different source dietary protein whole food calcium metabolism . Eventually finding could substantial public health implication provide widely available low risk mean help prevent osteoporosis .</brief_summary>
