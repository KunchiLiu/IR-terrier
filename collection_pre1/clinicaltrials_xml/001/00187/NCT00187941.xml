	<brief_summary>Individuals absorb Cellcept ( MMF/Mycophenolate Mofetil ) different rate difficult determine individual level Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF , trade name Cellcept ) single measurement . We enroll 20 subject . Plasma sample collect pre-MMF dose ( trough level ) 30 120 min morning dose MMF.This do weekly first month monthly next 6 mths . We hope use calculation subject total MMF level first month set trough target level use next 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MPA PK Monitoring Strategy With MMF/FK Based Immunosuppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We would use repeat Areas-Under-the-Curve ( AUC-a statistical mean summarize information series measurements one individual ) first month post transplant establish therapeutic drug exposure single patient . We would use individual trough level individual therapeutic AUC subsequent individual trough target range . For purpose study , order show target individualize Mycophenolic Acid ( MPA ) trough level effectively keep patient within therapeutic drug exposure range , would continue obtain abbreviated AUC 's follow visit . The investigator would blind result AUC 's first month transplant order allow drug exposure target trough measurement . From 4 day post transplant , would draw blood abbreviate AUC 's 4-5 subsequent clinic visit within 4 week time frame . We would change dose base AUC establish MPA target exposure 30 mg/L . The individual trough level correspond patient AUC target go used subsequent pk ( pharmacokinetic ) monitoring . For example patient 1250 mg bid Cellcept finally obtain AUC 40 mg/L/hr trough concentration time pk profile 2.5 mg/L , would subsequently target patient 's trough level 2.5 mg/L . The subsequent AUC 's ( need study , final monitoring strategy establish ) would serve confirm target trough 2.5 mg/L patient effectively stay within AUC target range 30-60 mg/L . The investigator would blind follow AUC 's first month primary objective study determine trough level target therapeutic exposure measure AUC achieve . The investigator would blind though initial AUC 's used get patient initially therapeutic target window . We would consider dose reduction base elevate trough level unless toxicity present . On hand would act low level dose increase 250 mg bid increment . For study would propose 20 subject enrol . Each patient would undergo abbreviated pk sample 4-5 time week 1 4 . Subsequently would abbreviate AUC 's monthly month 7 . We would enroll patient include present slow graft function delay graft function except patient early technical failure . Therefore study patient would undergo approximately 12 abbreviate AUC 's first 7 month 's post transplant . Drop patient replace new recruit obtain evaluable number patient .</detailed_description>
