	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether inhale corticosteroid ( fluticasone ) alters expression gene express lining airway asthmatic . The study use high density gene chip allow study investigator measure gene human genome . We hypothesize approach identify novel gene affect steroid asthmatic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This 10 week , randomize , double blind , prospective study compare effect inhale fluticasone inhaled placebo measure airway function , airway remodel airway gene expression asthmatic subject . Enrollment complete study visit . We data analysis phase . The study design follow : Following one-week run-in/characterization period , subject randomize receive 2 puff BID fluticasone ( 250µg/puff ) match placebo 8 week . Beginning run-in period , subject record daily diary peak flow measurement twice daily , ( symptoms cough , sputum production , wheeze , dyspnea , chest tightness . They visit laboratory interval diary review spirometry medication dispense . Bronchoscopy perform baseline ( week 1 run-in ) , 1 week start study drug Weekly telephone contact make treatment period monitor subject well ensure compliance study medication . There one-week run-out allow monitoring subject discontinuation study drug .</detailed_description>
