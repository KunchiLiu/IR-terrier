	<brief_summary>It know patient fracture legs sometimes develop blood clot ( know deep vein thrombosis ) leg . These clot may cause pain swell leg may detach travel lung produce shortness breath , chest pain , sometimes death . Unfortunately , know frequently complication occur leg fracture , use blood thinner medication effectively safely prevent clot . Doctors hospital across Canada conduct study patient surgery leg fracture receive either once-daily injection blood thinner , know low molecular weight heparin , placebo injection 14 day fracture . Neither patient doctor know patient medication patient placebo . All patient receive ultrasound examination legs 2 week surgery monitor deep vein thrombosis . In addition , patient check symptom leg lung clot side effect medication 3 month . If blood thinner show effective reduce complication document safe cost-effective setting recommend use patient . If , hand , frequency deep vein thrombosis low justify cost inconvenience take medication , also important finding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The D-KAF ( Dalteparin Knee-to-Ankle Fracture ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1 . What incidence clinically-important venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) follow surgically-repaired , isolated fracture tibia , fibula ankle ? 2 . In patient surgically-repaired , isolated fracture tibia , fibula ankle , simple anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis effective , safe , cost-effective ? BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Isolated below-knee fracture common injury see emergency department general hospital . Venographic study suggest incidence overall deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) follow fracture range 20–50 % . However , prospective study screen patient fracture DVT number methodologic limitation . In addition , thrombus detect distal small , therefore , uncertain clinical significance . Although patient leg fracture risk symptomatic DVT , PE , occasionally fatal PE , paucity reliable data incidence , risk factor , development clinically-important VTE follow contemporary treatment fracture . Furthermore , data relate thromboprophylaxis patient insufficient recommend prophylaxis , even patient whose fracture manage surgically . There considerable variation use prophylaxis patient across North America ; majority orthopedic surgeon use prophylaxis , small proportion use in-hospital prophylaxis , even small proportion use therapeutic level anticoagulation patient fully mobile without cast . The routine use prophylaxis patient below-knee fracture may necessary , may associate adverse effect relate prophylaxis , may cost-effective . A methodologically rigorous study require address issue . The D-KAF trial determine incidence , risk factor , clinically-important VTE patient isolated fracture tibia , fibula ankle , manage surgically . At time , D-KAF ass role , , routine thromboprophylaxis patient . The study potential significantly impact care patient irrespective whether result “ positive ” “ negative. ” The use clinically relevant endpoint great importance design future prophylaxis trial patient group . OBJECTIVES Among patient isolate , low extremity fracture tibia , fibula ankle , treat surgically , determine : 1 . The incidence clinically-important VTE first 3 month injury patient receive usual care ( thromboprophylaxis ) ; 2 . The predictor clinically-important VTE usual care patient ; 3 . The effectiveness , compare placebo , LMWH , dalteparin , give 5,000 U daily 14 day , prevention clinically-important VTE ; 4 . The safety prophylaxis regimen respect clinically-important bleeding ; 5 . The cost-effectiveness active intervention ; 6 . The predictor prophylaxis failure ( clinically-important VTE adverse event ) ; 7 . The incidence clinically-important VTE time LMWH discontinue week 12 ; objective seek determine prophylaxis beyond first 2 week indicate . STUDY DESIGN This randomize , double-blind , multi-center comparison LMWH , dalteparin , versus placebo patient isolated fracture tibia , fibula ankle , undergo surgical repair . It assess epidemiology VTE follow injury determine effectiveness , safety cost-effectiveness dalteparin prevent clinically important VTE . INTERVENTIONS All eligible patient provide informed consent , randomize receive : dalteparin , 5000 anti-Xa unit OR saline placebo give daily subcutaneous injection use identical pre-loaded syrinx - The first dose study drug commences soon possible fracture always within 72 hour injury . - Non-study anticoagulant prophylaxis mechanical prophylaxis ( graduate compression stocking , pneumatic compression pump venous foot pump ) allow . Use aspirin , antiplatelet agent NSAIDS discourage unless indication cardiac stroke prophylaxis , management arthritis , short-term postoperative analgesia . PATIENT ASSESSMENT Baseline Assessment : At baseline , patient : - History physical examination - Completion baseline case report form summarize past medical surgical history detail current injury management - CBC , INR , PTT , creatinine Follow-up Assessments : - All inpatient see daily monitor adherence protocol well symptoms sign DVT , PE , clinically significant bleed adverse event . - If discharge prior 14 day , patient teach self-administer study injection home research nurse . Patients call home every 3 day ensure compliance study medication address question concern related study . - All patient see follow-up 14 ± 2 day injury . At visit , focus history physical examination perform CBC obtain . All patient screen proximal DVT use bilateral duplex ultrasound examination . - Patients normal DUS study medication discontinue DVT prophylaxis give remainder study period . - All patient receive telephone follow 6 ± 1 week 3 month ± 1 week randomization assess clinical status . They ask specifically symptoms sign DVT PE , hospitalization , co-intervention ( administration anticoagulant ) . - Clinical suspicion possible DVT PE 3-month study period investigate standardized manner use objective diagnostic test pre-specified diagnostic algorithm . - All patient develop objectively confirm DVT PE , either symptomatic asymptomatic ( detect day 14 screen ultrasound ) , treat full-dose anticoagulation ( generally LMWH follow warfarin ) least 3 month . OUTCOME MEASURES Primary Outcome = Clinically important venous thromboembolism two study group . This composite outcome measure include symptomatic DVT , symptomatic PE , fatal PE 3 month follow fracture plus asymptomatic proximal DVT end prophylaxis phase . Symptomatic DVT : define clinically suspect DVT , confirm positive duplex ultrasound venography . Symptomatic PE : define clinically suspect PE , confirm high probability V/Q scan positive leg image DVT , spiral CT pulmonary angiogram . Fatal PE : confirm autopsy . Asymptomatic proximal DVT : screening ultrasound examination 14 +2 day . Secondary Outcomes : Clinically important VTE prophylaxis phase ( day 1 discontinuation study medication – usually correspond end-of-prophylaxis phase DUS day 14 + 2 ) . Clinically important VTE post-prophylaxis phase ( usually day 14 3 month ) . Bleeding ( modify International Bleeding Classification ) : Major - define overt bleed life threaten require surgical intervention , transfusion 1 unit red blood cell associate drop hemoglobin ³ 20 g/L development hemarthrosis compartment syndrome . Minor - overt bleeding define major . Bleeding index : This validated measure bleed take account change hematocrit amount blood transfuse . Costs associate prophylaxis relevant outcome . ANALYSES Baseline characteristic two study group compare patient randomize successfully complete study use appropriate parametric nonparametric statistic . Primary analysis base intention-to-treat principle compare proportion patient group develop primary outcome , objectively-confirmed , clinically-important VTE , 3 month follow-up period , use Yates-corrected chi-square test two independent proportion . Secondary analysis compare rate clinically important VTE two study phase , prophylaxis phase ( randomization day 14 + 2 ) post-prophylaxis phase ( day 14 3 month ) . A safety analysis compare bleed adverse event two group prophylaxis phase entire study period . Compliance assign intervention compare . Cost-effectiveness determine prospectively . Predictors thrombosis patient low extremity fracture ( placebo group ) predictor prophylaxis failure ( active treatment group ) explore use logistic regression analysis ( although recognize number event likely low ) . The factor consider include : age , gender , obesity ( BMI ) , smoke , varicose vein , oral contraceptive hormone replacement use , number risk factor , type fracture , method fracture treatment , delay surgery , OR time , time injury initiation prophylaxis , compliance , mobility end prophylaxis phase , fracture complication ( include infection , reoperation , non-union ) . SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION 1 . Assumptions use : = 0.05 ( 1-tail ) , power = 80 % , rate clinically important VTE control group = 4 % ; risk reduction prophylaxis = 75 % , yield Number Needed Prophylax = 33 . 2 . Assuming 5 % post-randomization attrition rate , estimate sample size 350 patient per group ; total 700 patient . 3 . A formal , blind interim analysis perform 500 patient complete follow-up .</detailed_description>
