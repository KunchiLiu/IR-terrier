	<brief_summary>Healthy African American subject normal hepatic renal function administer 10mg adefovir dipivoxil fast state . Subjects blood urine collection follow 24 hour measurement adefovir renal clearance . To investigate role age renal adefovir elimination , 8 subject enrol follow age group : 18-25 year 48-55 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There two major route elimination drug - hepatic metabolism renal elimination . For small , hydrophilic molecule , renal route predominates . The renal function patient take medication therefore determines pharmacokinetics ( extension clinical response ) medication . One common cause reduced renal function decline age . Renal drug elimination comprise passive drug filtration , active secretion , reabsorption ( occur active passive process ) . The filtration function kidney , approximate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) fall 25-50 % age 20 90 [ Turnheim 2003 ] . The decline renal function age identify major cause adverse drug reaction elderly population [ Lindeman 1995 ; MÃ¼hlberg 1999 ] . To avoid overdose exaggerated response medication , algorithms establish dose patient reduce renal function due change glomerular filtration . However , previous study look pharmacokinetics drug clear renal route , make observation appear contradict `` renal clearance decline age '' dogma . In study , Effect Genetic Variation Renal Transporter , OAT1 , Renal Secretion Adefovir ) , identify individual genetic variant OAT1 , transporter believe involved active secretion Adefovir . All OAT1 non-synonymous genetic variant identify African American population . We administer 10mg Adefovir dipivoxil 10 African American subject age 19 49 ( 4 genetic variant OAT1 , six without one ) . These subject identify parent study , call `` SOPHIE '' ( NCT00187668 ) . SOPHIE ( Studies Of Pharmacogenetics In Ethnically Diverse Individuals ) study DNA collect Bay Area adult ( 18-40 year age ) test drug response gene . In addition DNA donation , subject consent contact future study . We collect blood urine 24 hour calculate total renal clearance net secretory clearance adefovir . Although saw difference renal elimination adefovir subject attributable OAT1 variant , find correlation age renal clearance . Filtration ( calculate measure creatinine clearance ) remain constant population ( 112 ml/min + 18 ( SD ) ) , clearance Adefovir increase age . Both total renal clearance net secretory clearance increase age ( p=0.017 p=0.010 , respectively ) . This incidental finding interesting , may indicate age-dependence active drug elimination mechanism . However , sample size previous study small , observation may accurate . We therefore planned confirmatory study , expand study population . As initial find make African American subject , plan enroll additional 16 African American subject ( 8 follow age group : 18-25 48-55 ) . We also genotype individual variant transporter protein may play role adefovir renal elimination . If unexpected find age-related increase adefovir renal clearance observe study , additional follow-up study plan examine whether hold true ethnic group .</detailed_description>
