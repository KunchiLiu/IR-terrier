	<brief_summary>This protocol evaluate safety tolerability vaccine EnvDNA healthy adult . DNA-based vaccine study prevention human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , malaria hepatitis . DNA vaccine well tolerate human study date . The vaccine test study make information virus us make small part HIV . This small part call envelope coat around virus . We hope body make immune response HIV envelope coat . Our potential HIV DNA envelope vaccine call EnvDNA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Tolerability Recombinant DNA HIV-1 Vaccine Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research ( investigational ) study find safety new potential vaccine HIV . This potential vaccine may eventually become part sequence three experimental vaccine study see help protect people HIV . HIV infection cause AIDS ( Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ) . AIDS one serious viral infection know . This study do help u find HIV vaccine work . The vaccine test study make information virus us make small part HIV . This small part call envelope coat around virus . Because information one part virus use vaccine , vaccine cause HIV infection . We make vaccine test tube . The vaccine make DNA . DNA like instruction manual cell use make basic building block call protein . This DNA information cell use make envelope coat HIV . Once DNA inject intramuscularly , tell cell make envelope protein . We hope body make immune response HIV envelope coat . Our potential HIV DNA envelope vaccine call EnvDNA .</detailed_description>
