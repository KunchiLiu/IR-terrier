	<detailed_description>The DAVID II Clinical Study evaluate hypothesis , patient need ICD without overt indication pace , AAI pace maximal concomitant drug therapy increase rate combine endpoint mortality hospitalization new worsen heart failure , compare patient ventricular backup pacing ( VVI ) , AAI pace result reduction 0.425 year median event-free survival compare VVI pace . Enrollment Randomization : A total 600 patient enrol randomize . All patient previously enrol VVI arm DAVID Trial hemodynamically stable VVI-40 program mode willing participate randomize equal number study . New patient ( previously randomize DAVID ) also enrol similarly randomize . The randomization stratify investigational site , previous randomization DAVID v newly-enrolled , history CHF , , among new enrollee , primary versus preventive eligibility criterion . Patients enrol indication use DAVID Trial , include MADIT II indication , exception patient class III heart failure must optimal heart failure therapy least 3 month prior enrollment randomization . Any planned cardiac surgery ( ablation , endocardial resection , valve , aneurysmectomy , revascularization ) must complete randomization . All patient receive commercially available St. Jude dual chamber ICD system . Blinding : Patients tell pace mode , VVI AAI assign ( i.e. , blind ) order reduce potential patient generate bias quality life assessment part study . Crossover : All patient remain study device program accord randomization assignment , point randomization end follow-up . No crossover one pacing mode permit , even hospital admission congestive heart failure , reason request crossover review permission obtain University Washington Clinical Trials Center change pace mode . Optimal CHF Pharmacologic Therapy : Optimal CHF Pharmacologic Therapy study consist digoxin , diuretic , angiotensin-converting enzyme , ( ACE ) inhibitor , beta-blockers . Treatment study adheres Heart Failure Society America ( HFSA ) Practice Guidelines . Heart Failure symptom treat adjustment rate rate response pacemaker medication . Primary Endpoint : The primary endpoint either death CHF hospitalization . The determination CHF hospitalization make Events Committee base review hospital record blind treatment arm . Secondary endpoint include : - Appropriate ICD therapy -- ICD shock plus Antitachycardia Pacing ( ATP ) event ; - Inappropriate ICD therapy ( therapy deem related Ventricular Tachycardia ( VT ) Ventricular Fibrillation ( VF ) ; - Quality Life ( SF-36 , MLHF , VAS ) Follow-up : Patients follow 3-month interval . The patient also instruct call investigational center time receive ICD shock therapy delivery order ICD interrogation/download device 's memory perform . Data Items Collected : Standard demographic , clinical history , QoL assessment obtain baseline . During follow-up phase , routine clinical data obtain every 3 month . Quality life assessment repeat 6 month . Events ( adverse symptom , hospitalization , death ) trigger extensive data collection include , particular : 1 ) ICD printout , 2 ) detail hospital record CHF hospitalization , patient record death .</detailed_description>
