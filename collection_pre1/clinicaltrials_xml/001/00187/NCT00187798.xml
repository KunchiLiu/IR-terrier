	<brief_summary>Specific Aims : To compare metformin pharmacokinetics monozygotic dizygotic twin pair . Comparing renal clearance metformin monozygotic dizygotic twin allow u good understand influence heredity variation renal elimination . Furthermore , genotyping renal transporter gene monozygotic dizygotic twin pair significant difference renal clearance metformin may give u insight gene responsible variability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twin study long valuable tool examine relative role environment heredity health issue disease drug response . For example , twin study 1960 's 1970 's show first time variability elimination many drug largely influenced heredity . Monozygotic twin pair show little variability elimination various drug dizygotic twin pair , share one half gene , show much great variability . It known variability drug elimination observe dizygotic twin due genetic difference drug metabolize enzyme , cytochrome P450 's . However , genetic variation gene , membrane transporter may also contribute variability drug response . Membrane transporter play multiple role body ; help maintain cellular homeostasis import export mechanism also play important role drug response , affect pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug . Animal study use mouse genetically deficient drug transporter report drug interaction study involve transporter substrate provide convincing evidence level function several important drug transporter important determinant drug response . The current study examine difference renal clearance metformin monozygotic dizygotic twin pair . Metformin antidiabetic drug significant hepatic metabolism actively secrete kidney . Studies lab show metformin substrate human organic cation transporter , hOCT2 , appear major transporter involve renal secretion cationic drug . Data literature indicate substantial variation net secretory clearance metformin normal , healthy volunteer . In five healthy volunteer , ratio renal clearance creatinine clearance range 1.5 4.2 , nearly 3-fold variation . We hypothesize genetic variation secretory transporter kidney , like hOCT2 , may responsible inter-individual difference secretory clearance metformin drug . Studies examine renal clearance metformin monozygotic dizygotic twin allow u good understand influence heredity variation renal elimination . Furthermore , genotyping monozygotic dizygotic twin pair significant difference renal clearance metformin may give u insight gene responsible variability .</detailed_description>
