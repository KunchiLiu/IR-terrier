	<brief_summary>The current study part large multi-investigator grant look pharmacogenetics number membrane transporter . Previously , investigator recruit cohort healthy volunteer ( Studies Pharmacogenetics Ethnically-Diverse Populations , SOPHIE ) resequenced cod region number membrane transporter gene identify genetic polymorphism gene . Subjects cohort agree call back recruitment study base genetic sequence , allow investigator possibility prospectively study influence genetic polymorphism particular phenotype ( i.e. , genotype-to-phenotype study ) . The investigator plan take genotype-to-phenotype approach study influence specific polymorphism novel organic cation transporter 2 ( OCTN2 ) gene carnitine lipid metabolism healthy subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although OCTN2 fairly well study relationship SCD , little know carrier frequency disease-causing allele OCTN2 , common functional polymorphism gene . To address issue , screen genetic variant OCTN2 cod region direct sequencing exon flank intronic region OCTN2 large sample ( n = 276 ) ethnically diverse subject . In addition , establish lymphoblastoid cell line subject homozygous either allele previously identify promoter region variant , -207G &gt; C . We find eight amino acid sequence variant OCTN2 , three ( Phe17Leu , Leu144Phe , Pro549Ser ) polymorphic least one ethnic group . When assayed functional activity expression human embryonic kidney 293 cell , use probe endogenous substrate ( l-carnitine ) organic cation tetraethylammonium , three variant show functional difference reference OCTN2 ( Phe17Leu , Tyr449Asp , Val481Phe ; p &lt; 0.05 ) . Further study Phe17Leu polymorphism show reduce V ( max ) l-carnitine transport approximately 50 % reference OCTN2 . Confocal microscopy study use OCTN2-GFP fusion protein show Phe17Leu distinct subcellular localization reference OCTN2 , diffuse cytoplasmic retention Phe17Leu , contrast reference OCTN2 , localize specifically plasma membrane . Lymphoblasts subject homozygous -207G allele show increase l-carnitine transport compare -207C/C homozygote ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . This study suggest although loss-of-function mutation OCTN2 likely rare , common variant OCTN2 find healthy population may contribute variation disposition carnitine clinically use drug .</detailed_description>
