	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Tarceva , Temodar , Radiation Therapy Patients With Newly Diagnosed Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II Study Tarceva plus Temodar follow radiation therapy patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma . The efficacy safety profile Tarceva combination radiation therapy plus Temodar study . In addition , correlation response treatment epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) status well molecular marker tumor prior treatment explore . Patients stratify accord enzyme induce anti epileptic drug ( EIAED ) use . Group A ( EIAEDs ) take 100 milligram ( mg ) Tarceva/day radiotherapy start dose 150 mg Tarceva/day two week radiotherapy . Group B ( EIAEDs ) take 200mg Tarceva/day radiotherapy start dose 300 mg Tarceva/day two week radiotherapy . Both group take 75 mg/m^2 Temodar/day radiotherapy 200 mg/m^2 Temodar/day x 5 two week radiotherapy . Intrapatient Tarceva dose escalation may occur every two week radiotherapy appearance particular rash severity . The maximum dose allow 200 mg group A 500 mg group B .</detailed_description>

An magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) computer tomography ( CT ) must obtain within 14 day treatment . The use MRI rather CT prefer . The type scan , i.e. , MRI CT must use throughout period protocol treatment assessment tumor status . Patients without measurable assessable disease eligible . Patient must prior cranial radiation therapy . Patients must receive prior cytotoxic drug therapy , noncytotoxic drug therapy , experimental drug therapy brain tumor . Patients receive Gliadel wafer time original resection exclude . Patients must plan begin partial brain radiotherapy day Tarceva temozolomide . Radiotherapy must ) Radiation Oncology Department University California San Francisco b ) affiliate site radiation oncologist UCSF provide assurance radiation perform specify . Radiotherapy must give external beam partial brain field daily fraction 1.8 2.0 Gy , plan total dose tumor 59406100 cGy . Stereotactic radiosurgery brachytherapy allow . Patients must willing forego cytotoxic noncytotoxic drug therapy tumor treat Tarceva temozolomide . All patient must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study .
