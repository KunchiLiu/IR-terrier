	<brief_summary>Hypopituitary adult hormonal deficiency well subsituted excepted growth hormone ( GH ) die early rest population . GH deficiency involve fat mass increase regard lean mass , atherogenic lipidic profile participate osteopenia mechanism decrease life quality . All dysfunction partially totally correct GH prescription patient deficient since adulthood . However , patient deficient since childhood , study demonstrate GH treatment childhood present benefit treat adulthood . Primary objective study examine fat mass significantly decrease due GH treatment adulthood patient GH deficient since childhood , treat GH childhood stop since end adolescence . We compare body composition others energetic metabolism parameter two patient group , one treat GH 18 month , treatment . Body composition bone density measure pletysmography ( DEXA ) . Metabolic parameter : energetic balance ( energy intake evaluation questionnaire , energetic expenditure evaluate doubly labelled water ) biologic parameter ( lipidic profile , thyroid hormone ) . This study evaluate GH treatment young GH deficient adult since childhood benefit body composition , lipidic profile bone density .</brief_summary>
