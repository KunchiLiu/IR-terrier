	<brief_summary>Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) use successfully promote extubation premature infant population . The two method CPAP examine currently use many institution , yet study compare method determine good population newborn &lt; 1500 gram ( birth weight ) support extubation . This randomise control study examine two type CPAP : Infant Flow System Bubble CPAP . This randomise control , single site , clinical study determine whether Bubble CPAP Infant Flow System ( IFS ) CPAP effective support extubation infant birth weight &lt; 1500 gram . Seventy-six infant randomise , immediately prior extubation , IFS Bubble CPAP 5 cmH2O . The primary outcome successful extubation , define reach failure criterion 7 day post-extubation . Failure criterion define pH &lt; 7.25 PCO2 &gt; 65 mmHg sustain increase FiO2 0.15 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Methods Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) Support Successful Extubation Infants Birth Weights ≤ 1500 Grams ( C2CPAP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) use successfully promote extubation premature infant population ( Davis &amp; Henderson-Smart , 2002 ) . The two method CPAP examine use many institution , yet study compare method determine good population newborn &lt; 1500 gram ( birth weight ) support extubation . This study may cost saving implication . If bubble CPAP show effective application neonatal intensive care unit ( NICUs ) affordable option provide effective CPAP . Methods : This randomise control , single site , clinical study determine Bubble CPAP Infant Flow System ( IFS ) CPAP effective support extubation infant birth weight &lt; 1500 gram . Seventy-six infant randomise immediately prior extubation IFS Bubble CPAP 5 cmH2O . The primary outcome successful extubation , define reach failure criterion 7 day post-extubation . Failure criterion define pH &lt; 7.25 PCO2 &gt; 65 mmHg sustain increase FiO2 0.15 . Participants : Parents/guardians eligible infant approach give information regard study , question answer . They allow consider study participation private . The recruiter return agreed time inform consent obtain agree participate . Parents approach accordance guideline NICU @ SWCHSC . Infants eligible birth weight &lt; 1500 gram , extubated CPAP know airway anomaly , suspect genetic anomaly . Analysis : Multiple ANOVA analysis use continuous variable , chi-square categorical variable , include primary outcome . Conclusion : The result study determine method CPAP best method support extubation &lt; 1500 g infant .</detailed_description>
