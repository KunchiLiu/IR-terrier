	<brief_summary>Rstenosis common angioplasty atherosclerotic disease femoral artery . Pilot study data suggest adjuvant photodynamic therapy , use delta amino kleavulinic acid photosensitiserr feasible safe . This study examine safety large population , recruitment number allow , efficacy assess . Hypothesis : ALA photodynamic therapy safe well tolerate adjuvant angioplasty treatment femoral artery atherosclerotic stenosis occlusion . A secondary endpoint seek : hypothesis : PDT reduce restenosis rate follow adjuvant photodynamic therapy compare standard balloon angioplasty treatment superficial femoral arterial disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty ( PTA ) well recognise treatment obstructive vascular disease . Despite initial high procedural success technique limit subsequent development restenosis 50 % patient 3 6 month . , The pathological hallmark restenosis long consider development neointimal hyperplasia consist smooth muscle cell extracellular matrix . We realise however elastic recoil vessel concept remodelling important determine overall response vessel injury . Remodelling involves geometric change vessel maximum arterial dimension may increase ( positive remodelling ) decrease ( negative remodelling ) . , , Despite extensive research pharmacological interventional strategy show overwhelming effect restenosis rate angioplasty . Recently attention focus potential intraluminal radiation therapy ( Brachytherapy ) whilst technique show considerable promise concern regard long term complication safety ionise radiation non-malignant disease report vessel wall damage treatment . , Photodynamic therapy novel technique involve activation previously administer photosensitising agent non thermal laser light . This result generation reactive oxidative product result tissue effect . It technique use treatment variety malignancy realisation may influence response vessel wall balloon injury particularly promising . 5 Aminolaevulinic acid ( ALA ) relatively new photosensitise agent convert active metabolite , Protoporphyrin IX ( PPIX ) biosynthesis haem . In small animal model photodynamic therapy show cause medial smooth muscle cell depletion reduce degree neointimal hyperplasia injury detrimental effect mechanical integrity vessel wall . , Large animal work use swine model confirm finding also demonstrate favourable vessel wall remodelling occur PDT . Repopulation medium smooth muscle cell , early depletion , also demonstrate likely important consider long term effect treatment vessel wall . The use large animal model enable development endovascular system delivery laser light . As result , light finding large animal study , possible conduct pilot clinical study look safety efficacy adjuvant PDT patient undergo repeat PTA superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) disease restenosed less 6 month earlier angioplasty . In study show patient asymptomatic 6 month procedure adjuvant PDT arterial procedural complication . These finding support improvement non-invasive endpoint abscence significant restenosis assess digital subtraction angiography . These result encourage position conduct randomise clinical trial look standard balloon angioplasty without adjuvant photodynamic therapy treatment peripheral vascular disease .</detailed_description>
