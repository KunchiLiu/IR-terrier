	<brief_summary>This study determine whether antibiotic therapy need patient non-life threatening soft tissue infection . Most patient soft tissue infection presently treat antibiotic . Many infection resolve without proper antibiotic treatment . Treatment patient antibiotic surgical drainage abscess may necessary indiscriminate use antibiotic may lead colonization drug-resistant organism . Subsequent infection drug resistant organism may limit choice antibiotic complicate infection . A comparison antibiotic treatment antibiotic treatment surgically treat , uncomplicated soft tissue infection need address important question .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Placebo Controlled Study Antibiotic Treatment Soft Tissue Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Integrated Soft Tissue Infection Service ( ISIS ) Clinic San Francisco General Hospital treat large number patient soft tissue infection , data suggest antibiotic may overused infection . Most infection treat surgical drainage abscess ( 77 % ) . When microbiologic culture perform , 88 % abscess infected Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) , 55 % abscess contain methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) . Recently , high prevalence MRSA infection document San Francisco throughout country . Presently , patient treat antibiotic drainage abscess . Our retrospective analysis find 60 % infection resolve without appropriate antibiotic treatment . These patient infect MRSA treat antibiotic active organism . This imply surgical drainage abscesses probably important treatment antibiotic treatment probably necessary . Unnecessary use antibiotic adverse consequence . Some patient allergic reaction antibiotic . Patients develop serious gastrointestinal infection antibiotic use . Antibiotics costly . But importantly , overuse antibiotic may significant factor spread antibiotic resistant organism . The increased prevalence MRSA make extremely difficult treat patient appropriate antibiotic life threaten infection ( i.e . bacterial endocarditis , osteomyelitis , necrotizing soft tissue infection ) . The experience ISIS Clinic bring question present practice antibiotic use patient surgically manage abscess . Many surgeon practice ISIS clinic believe antibiotic little effect clinical course uncomplicated infection . Elimination antibiotic use uncomplicated infection would certainly simplify care patient . It even possible decrease antibiotic use may decrease prevalence MRSA colonization population . However , decrease prevalence MRSA colonization specifically address limited study . A randomized , prospective blind trial compare standard antibiotic treatment treatment help determine whether antibiotic really need infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must complicate skin skinstructure infection meet disease diagnostic criterion ( severity , definition complicate , disease ) . SEVERITY : Complicated soft tissue infection must sufficient severity anticipate five day antibiotic therapy . DEFINITION OF COMPLICATED ( one follow criterion must meet ) : Infection require ( ed ) significant surgical intervention ( debridement devitalize tissue , drainage abscess , removal foreign body implicated infection ) time enrollment . DISEASE : Major Abscess ( open wound ) . The patient must follow : ) Acute onset within seven day prior enrollment . ii ) Purulent drainage purulent aspirate . iii ) Erythema , induration , tenderness . iv ) Evidence loculated fluid physical examination , blind aspiration , ultrasound require intervention ( aspiration , incision drainage , excision ) time enrollment . 2 . A culture must obtain time enrollment . 3 . Patients must least 18 year age . 4 . The patient must sign date Committee Human Researchapproved inform consent form . 1 . Any following condition : 1 . Patients unlikely survive treatment period evaluation . 2 . Conditions toxic shock syndrome toxiclike syndrome ( Mandell et al . 2000 ) , shock hypotension ( supine systolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg ) refractory fluid short course pressor challenge ( four hour less ) oliguria ( urine output &lt; 20 mL/hr ) responsive fluid challenge . 3 . Incisional wound extend visceral compartment . 4 . Suspected proven contiguous bony joint involvement . 5 . Malignant otitis externa . 6 . Ischemic ulcer wound associate sever arterial insufficiency gangrene . 7 . Infection prosthetic material venous catheter remove part treatment current infection . 8 . Infection fullthickness burn wound burn wind &gt; 20 % total body area . 2 . Surgical/nonsurgical debridement devitalize tissue , removal prosthetic material , incision drainage , suture removal , percutaneous aspiration , packing , dressing , irrigation ( include antibiotic ) institute time enrollment . 3 . Any known sensitivity cephalexin . 4 . Patients renal compromise .</criteria>
