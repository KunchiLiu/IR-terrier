	<detailed_description>The objective study examine relationship severity illness , temporal change activity endocrine , metabolic bioenergetic pathway , consequent immune dysfunction critically ill patient sepsis multiple organ failure Intensive Care Unit . This study undertaken use sequential blood sampling ( ICU discharge ) muscle biopsy ( maximum 5 ) critically ill patient ( ) ( b ) without sepsis plus comparator group undergo elective orthopaedic surgery . A variety hormonal , cytokine , immune mitochondrial measure wil lbe make ass whether relationship exist alteration different pathway , whether eventual survivor non-survivors distinguish .</detailed_description>
