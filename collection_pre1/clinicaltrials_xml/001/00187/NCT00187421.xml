	<brief_summary>The primary objective propose study determine strategy intraoperative patency assessment graft revision decrease rate graft occlusion significant stenosis ( &gt; 50 % ) 6-12 week coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) versus traditional operative management without routine intraoperative patency assessment . Patency assess new fluorescence angiography technique well ultrasonic transit-time flow measurement . We hypothesize strategy intraoperative patency assessment graft revision significantly reduce frequency graft occlusion 6-12 week comparison patient intraoperative patency assessment . We also hypothesize strategy intraoperative patency assessment graft revision significantly reduce frequency 50-99 % stenoses 6-12 week comparison patient intraoperative patency assessment . We expect group experience similar perioperative outcome hypothesize patient receive strategy intraoperative patency assessment graft revision experience improve long-term graft patency freedom late clinical event 5-6 year post-operatively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The immediate long term success coronary surgery dependent construction high quality anastomosis durable conduit appropriate target coronary vessel . Significant advance medical therapy include early post-operative aspirin administration increase use arterial grafting improve early , midterm late graft patency . However , modern coronary bypass series continue report perioperative graft occlusion rate high 11 % . These early graft failure predominantly ascribe technical problem graft anastomosis site may preventable . New intraoperative graft assessment technology recently become available identify technical problem repair operating room . However , technique increase length bypass operation may false positive , may lead unnecessary potentially damaging graft revision . The primary objective propose study determine strategy intraoperative patency assessment graft revision decrease rate graft occlusion significant stenosis ( &gt; 50 % ) 6-12 week coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) versus traditional operative management without routine intraoperative patency assessment .</detailed_description>
