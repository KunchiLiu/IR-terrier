	<brief_summary>N-acetylcysteine medication commonly use past prevent liver damage acetaminophen overdose . N-acetylcysteine also use patient pre-existing kidney damage prevent kidney damage result dye use test angiogram ( dye study ) . This study hop prove medication may also help protect kidney damage cause heart-lung machine cardiac surgery . This damage kidneys happen patient undergo cardiac surgery require use heart-lung machine . Kidney failure surgery serious complication ( 2-30 % patient kidney problem develop ) lead short term long-term dialysis well death ( 30 % death rate kidney failure develop ) . The study test intravenous N-acetylcysteine safe effective prevent kidney problem cardiac surgery use heart-lung machine . Approximately 104 patient enrol Sunnybrook Women ’ College Health Science Centre . The study review approve ethic committee Sunnybrook Women ’ College Health Science Centre . The study compare effect N-acetylcysteine placebo ( salt solution ) . The study medication ( either N-acetylcysteine placebo ) give addition usual medication surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study The Effectiveness N-Acetylcysteine Kidney Protection Following Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) oral intravenous agent replenishes glutathione turn allow formation glutathione peroxidase , important enzyme degradation cascade reactive free oxygen radical . NAC show reduce recurrent cardiac event set ischemic injury , help prevent progression renal dysfunction patient chronic renal failure expose nephrotoxic dye radiographic study . Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) show nephrotoxic may production oxygen free radical produce consequence : systemic inflammatory response pump , renal hypoperfusion loss pulsatile flow kidney CPB . Renal dysfunction post cardiac surgery lead short long term dialysis , increase mortality rate . NAC therefore may ideal agent preserve renal function patient require exposure CPB high risk develop postoperative renal dysfunction . The hypothesis test study IV NAC may minimize postoperative renal dysfunction sustain exposure cardiopulmonary bypass circuit . Objectives : This study answer question whether perioperative intravenous N-Acetylcysteine ( NAC ) effective reduce postoperative renal dysfunction measure change peak creatinine baseline value great equal 50μmol/L placebo NAC group adult , elective patient high risk renal insufficiency follow exposure cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . This study randomize , placebo control , double blind trial address follow objective : 1.To determine intravenous N-Acetylcysteine ( NAC ) effective reduce post cardiopulmonary bypass renal dysfunction . It hypothesize IV NAC provide renal protection may effective prophylactic option patient high risk postoperative renal failure exposure CPB , avoid ensue high mortality rate associate . Study Design : This study consist single centre , randomize , stratify , double blind , placebo control trial intraoperative use placebo IV N-acetylcysteine ( n=104 patient ) . Study population : Includes patient preoperative renal dysfunction ( serum creatinine level 140 μmol/L great calculate glomerular filtration rate 50 mL/min less ) , risk factor score postoperative renal dysfunction add 6 base follow scale : Score Risk Factor : 3 schedule redo cardiac surgery 3 schedule valve surgery 2 age great 69 time surgery 2 know diabetic ( Type I II ) 2 congestive heart failure 2 treat hypertension 2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 2 preoperative stroke 1 leave ventricular function –grade 3 4 ( see echo angiogram ) 1 New York Heart Association Class 3 4 Exclusion Criteria : Patient participate another trial - Patient receive NAC past 48 hour . - Patient allergy N-acetylcysteine . - Patient schedule off-pump surgery extracardiac procedure ( pericardiectomy etc . ) - Patient require emergent surgery - Patient schedule procedure involve circulatory arrest . - Patient require chronic dialysis ( peritoneal hemodialysis ) - Patient unable give inform consent ( dementia , speak English , etc . ) - Patient recent history cancer ( last five year ) untreated cancer Randomization : Patients randomize either placebo IV NAC ( one one allocation ) . There four stratum . The four stratum consist major division isolate CABG surgery valve surgery subdivision risk factor patient , patient preoperative renal insufficiency . The patient randomize three stratum use permuted-block randomization block size 4 . The randomization number keep pharmacy personnel available unblinding case emergency would include anaphylaxis , hypotension ( mean bp le 60 mmHg ) , liver failure . Blinding preserve IV NAC placebo dispense identical IV solution bag distinguish . Intervention : Patients randomize receive either NAC ( 150 mg/kg bolus 15 minute induction 50 mg/kg/hr infusion cardiopulmonary bypass ) placebo ( amount saline bolus infusion ) . We also provide standard guideline suggest perioperative management patient pertain renal protection include use co-interventions IV fluid management , pulsatile CPB , use vasopressor maintain adequate perfusion pressure follow CPB . Blinding : The patient caregiver blind treatment group placebo identical IV NAC appearance . The research personnel collect data also blind . The pharmacy personnel one aware treatment assignment . Blinding breach except emergency situation outline . The cardiac surgeon anesthetist ask believe patient study drug ensure blind preserve . Intention Treat : The study include patient tolerate NAC receive full NAC dosage adverse event intention treat manner . These patient full maneuver therefore include final analysis . Outcomes : The primary outcome compare NAC placebo group increase serum creatinine preoperative baseline level exposure CPB . The secondary outcome include glomerular filtration rate ( calculate serum creatinine , demographic variable well serum cystatin C ) , blood urea nitrogen , early dialysis ( in-hospital ) , in-hospital mortality , postoperative myocardial infarction ( MI ) , peak troponin , stroke , postoperative low output syndrome . Adverse event hypotension , anaphylaxis alteration coagulation parameter document . Implication Potential Results : If study show renal protection IV NAC could use effective prophylactic option patient high risk postoperative renal failure ensue high mortality rate associate .</detailed_description>
