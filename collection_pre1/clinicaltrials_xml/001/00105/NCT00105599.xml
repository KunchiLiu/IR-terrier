	<detailed_description>Background : This study FairCare Program ( FC ) design address end life ( EOL ) care delivery issue reduce barrier effective EOL care among health care provider , family member , surrogate , Chronic Heart Failure ( CHF ) patient use comprehensive , multi-pronged approach deliver care coordinator support interdisciplinary team . Objectives : Evaluate impact FC : 1 ) improving quality life ( QOL ) health care delivery CHF patient advance illness , ( i.e . ejection fraction 35 % less , assess level III IV NYS Heart Association Classification System ) ; 2 ) address fear die ; 3 ) increase use Advance Directives ( ADs ) ; 4 ) improve provider compliance ADs . Also , describe trend may occur disease-specific QOL , survival , health care use cost . Methods : The study employ randomize control group design . There two treatment arm , FC treatment condition , usual care ( UC ) control condition . Assessments improve quality life ( QOL ) , quality care delivery take baseline , three six month . Assessments AD use , i.e . frequency formulation documentation ADs , take baseline , three six month one year 18 month . Because data compliance ADs utilization cost may fully comprehensive patient ' death , maximize sample size variable , hence power study detect difference outcome , data compliance ADs collect final year study , data utilization cost aggregate monthly interval collect baseline 18 month . One year VA pre-intervention health care utilization cost data also collect assess baseline utilization control pre-existing difference propensity patient use health care service . Also , intention treat methodology use data analysis . Status : The study end 9-30-04 , data VA cost , Medicare cost , consistency medical care patient preference , survival , collect analyzed final report .</detailed_description>
