	<detailed_description>Background : Veterans admit Veterans Health Administration ( VA ) Nursing Homes ( NH ) impairment ability perform activity daily live ( ADL ) overwhelm support system ( family/friends ) community . The etiology impairment , part , due chronic disease , deconditioning , immobility . Yet , admission , NH resident frequently decrease level daily activity compare preadmission activity . Our preliminary observation suggest dependent , frail resident improve function response exercise NH setting . Objectives : By compare exercise group non-exercise group receive comparable level staff attention positive reinforcement , determine whether change function normally associate low intensity exercise due exercise factor . Methods : We conduct blind , prospective , randomize , control , clinical investigation VA nursing home , compare effect four month low intensity exercise effect music art activity : 1 ) muscle mass , assess DEXA scan ; 2 ) physical function , assess timed performance test , strength independence ADL ; 3 ) cost NH care , assess measure cost providing care within NH minus cost providing intervention . Study set VA nursing home , resident participant new admission NH 65 year old . All participant must able follow one step command able participate group activity . Participants Mini Mental Status Exam ( MMSE ) less 24/30 must consent authorized representative . Screening candidate complete NH admission . Upon completion consent process , participant randomly assign either exercise group music/art group . Baseline test include DEXA scan , timed performance test observation ADL complete prior participation activity . At conclusion four month activity , baseline test repeat . Status : Recruitment intervention stage project complete . In order achieve desire number participant , request make approval received extension recruitment stage March 2005 December 2005 . Interventions would continue March 2006 analysis data complete December 2006 .</detailed_description>
