	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical study see experimental drug , call MM-093 , safe effective treatment rheumatoid arthritis . MM-093 genetically engineer version naturally occur protein call alpha fetoprotein ( AFP ) . Adults normally small amount AFP bloodstream . However , pregnancy , AFP level mother fetus much high normal . It observe woman RA ( Rheumatoid Arthritis ) few symptoms pregnancy , particularly third trimester . At time , level AFP blood mother fetus high . This observation lead researcher begin examine AFP possible treatment RA .</brief_summary>
