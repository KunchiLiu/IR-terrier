	<detailed_description>Background : Hearing impairment one common disability veteran . The decreased ability communicate troubling , strong association hearing loss functional decline depression add burden hearing-impaired . Although hear amplification improve quality life , hear evaluation offer infrequently old patient . Only 25 percent patient aidable hearing loss receive treatment . Up 30 percent patient receive hear aid use . We contend effective formal screen program identify hearing-impaired patient motivate seek evaluation derive benefit treatment . Objectives : The first specific aim determine formal screening program hear loss increase visit audiologists . The second specific aim determine specific screen strategy lead frequent audiology visit . Methods : Our four-armed randomized clinical trial compare three screen strategy ( physiologic testing , self-report questionnaire , combine use physiologic self-report testing ) , control arm ( usual care ) . Physiologic test do Audioscope , portable otoscope emit tone select frequency variety loudness level . The self-report questionnaire screen version Hearing Handicap Inventory Elderly questionnaire ( HHIE-S ) , quantify social emotional handicap hearing loss . Patients age 50 old wear hearing aid recruit outpatient clinic VA Puget Sound Health Care System . Only patient eligible VA-issued hearing aid enrol trial . Patients randomize control arm screen . Patients screen Audioscope HHIE-S refer audiology service evaluation either test positive . All patient , regardless screen status , follow determine many patient arm subsequently visit audiologist . The primary outcome percentage patient contact audiology service within 6 month date screening . Secondary outcome include : 1 ) number case hear loss detect ; 2 ) number dispense hearing aid ; 3 ) self-rated communication ability ; 4 ) hearing-related quality life ; 5 ) rate hear aid adherence . Costs screen subsequent treatment collect . The study power determine cost-effectiveness , pilot calculation cost implement screen program make . An intention-to-screen analysis use minimize bias due subject self-selection . Status : Enrollment follow-up complete . Outcomes data currently analyze .</detailed_description>
