	<brief_summary>This study examine effect transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) short-term memory healthy adult . Healthy people use brain answer short-term memory question different way patient schizophrenia . Attention memory deficit schizophrenia patient significantly hamper recovery rehabilitation , yet effective treatment impairment . TMS method brain stimulation may able change electrical activity nerve cell brain improve certain brain function . This study explore effect TMS memory perhaps discover brain process may helpful develop new way treat schizophrenia . Healthy volunteer 18 55 year age , exclude pregnant woman , may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history , physical examination , blood test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , urine pregnancy test woman childbearing age . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) functional MRI ( fMRI ) . These test do participant structural functional MRIs participant NIMH 's 2-day schizophrenia study within 90 day enter current study . MRI do locate place brain simulate TMS fMRI do look brain activity subject solve short-term memory task . Both test do session . Before scan , four vitamin E capsule tap subject 's scalp . After capsules place , subject lie stretcher move scanner - narrow cylinder strong magnetic field . During scan , subject ask simple test , watch picture screen press button response number show second earlier . Scanning may take 2 hour , usually last 45 90 minute . - TMS . For procedure , subject receive either active TMS sham procedure ( placebo ) imitate TMS use real electrical stimulation . For TMS , insulate wire coil place scalp brief electrical current pass . This generate magnetic pulse travel scalp skull cause small electrical current cortex , out part brain . The stimulation may cause muscle twitch scalp face may also cause small movement limb . During procedure , electrodes taped scalp record electrical activity brain short-term memory test . Two test make set . There total six test set ; set take 3 minute . Five period electrical stimulation deliver test set . Each period stimulation last 5 second , follow 10-second rest period . The stimulation-rest interval continue five period TMS apply . For memory test , subject press key computer keyboard quickly accurately possible test ability remember string number , letter . - Questionnaires . At begin end TMS session , participant fill questionnaires assess mood , ability concentrate , level anxiety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Psychiatrists recognize cognitive dysfunction principal impediment recovery psychosocial rehabilitation patient schizophrenia since first edition Emil Kraepelin 's 1893 masterwork , Dementia Praecox . While currently available pharmacotherapy may improve psychotic symptom , still largely effective treatment impairment critical executive function - attention work memory - widely consider functional nexus extremely costly illness . Thus , appear heuristically reasonable consider putative mode treatment may specifically target deficit . For example , abundant evidence support assumption pre-task alpha band power , measure mean peak frequency , inversely associate reaction time ( RT ) - index encode efficiency - work memory task . Additionally , recent evidence suggest pre-task alpha peak frequency predict outcome test work memory . Evidence also suggest patient schizophrenia low pre-task alpha peak frequency , slow RT work memory paradigm , n-back Sternberg compare healthy control ; take together , weight evidence lends plausibility assumption increase patient ' pre-task alpha band power might associate faster reaction time . Notably regard , recent evidence suggest transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) may increase pre-task alpha , associate faster RT healthy subject . There yet report effect TMS alpha band peak frequency , reaction time , patient schizophrenia . A critical obstacle progress clinical neuroscience TMS effect human subject absence mean determine optimal subject-specific brain region target TMS . Cortical target stimulation customarily select basis group mean data , tacit assumption candidate TMS utilize distribute neural circuit perform particular cognitive task . This untested assumption conceivable source confuse discrepancy TMS clinical trial outcome , example , depression treatment literature . In regard , group laboratory recently report use structural equation modeling ( SEM ) base path analysis construct group subject-specific model 2-back work memory task healthy subject study PET . The result investigation suggest may significant association cognitive strategy , circuit path , memory performance . We find high score associate activation leave hemisphere distribute circuit , verbal cognitive strategy , low score subject utilized right hemisphere circuit , visuo-spatial strategy . Notably , finding congruent previous study use different method analysis similar paradigm . Taken together , data suggest trial TMS aim improve work memory reaction time elevate pre-task alpha power first identify predominant node subject-specific working memory sub-network putative site stimulation . There report approach TMS target selection either healthy control , patient schizophrenia . In proof concept healthy subject protocol , principle assumption alpha frequency TMS direct subject-specific predominant node ( right leave DLPFC ) distribute neural network reduces reaction time n-back Sternberg work memory paradigm .</detailed_description>
