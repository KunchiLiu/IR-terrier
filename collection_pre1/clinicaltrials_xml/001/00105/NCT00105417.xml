	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether interleukin-7 ( IL-7 ) drug similar natural IL-7 protein produce body , safe use people infect HIV . IL-7 important immune system function . In human , extend life immune cell call T-cells increase function maturation ; mouse , speed immune system recovery follow chemotherapy transplantation ; monkey , make T-cells increase number . If study show IL-7 safe , trial determine improve number function T-cells HIV-infected people . Patients 18 year age old HIV infection take anti-HIV medication least 12 month , whose CD4 count least 100 cells/microliter , whose viral load 50,000 copies/milliliter may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination , blood urine test , include blood test HLA type ( genetic test marker immune system ) , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram , ultrasound spleen . Participants undergo follow test procedures 9 visit , follow : Pre-entry visit - Brief physical examination , include examination lymph node spleen . - Medical history , include question current past medication . - Urine pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . - Blood draw viral load , immune response , routine safety test . Entry visit - Complete physical examination , include examination lymph node spleen . - Routine urine test urine pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . - Blood draw viral load , immune response , routine safety test . - IL-7 dosing . Participants randomly assign receive one five dos IL-7 ( 3 , 10 , 30 , 60 100 microgram per kilogram body weight ) placebo ( salt solution contain IL-7 ) . The dose may give one injection , high dose possibly require many seven eight injection . The injection give subcutaneously ( skin ) , usually arm leg . After injection , patient monitor closely 12 hour skin allergic reaction . Blood drawn injection 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 4 , 8 12 hour injection check blood level study medication . Follow-up visit Patients come clinic 7 time follow-up-every day first 4 day injection , 14 day , 4 week , 8 week injection . At study visit , patient follow procedure : - Brief physical examination , include examination lymph node spleen . - Routine urine test urine pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . - Blood draw viral load , immune response , routine safety test . - Blood test measure amount study medication blood 1 , 2 , 3 day injection - Electrocardiogram 1 day injection</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interleukin 7 essential cytokine thymic development post-thymic survival , expansion maturation T lymphocytes human . Therapeutic use IL7 mouse model show enhancement immune reconstitution chemotherapy bone marrow transplantation . The rationale use IL-7 immunotherapy HIV infection would support expansion , survival functional property T lymphocytes enhance immune reconstitution . More specifically , IL7 may provide mean support CD4 expansion patient good viral suppression persistent low CD4 count ( immunologic non-responders ) patient available antiretroviral option . Finally , give role IL7 T cell memory maturation survival , IL-7 may promise vaccine adjuvant . Studies rhIL7 non-human primate show T cell proliferation expansion achieve dos well tolerate without significant toxicity . A safety study cancer patient currently ongoing NCI . A5214 ( Pleiades ) first study rhIL7 evaluate safety single subcutaneous injection HIV infect adult . Eligible subject ( CD4 great 100 cells/micro l VL le 50,000 copies/ml , antiretroviral therapy least one year ) stratify viral load ( less 50 50-50,000 copies/ml ) randomize 3:1 receive rhIL7 placebo . Pleiades phase I , double-blind trial test safety single subcutaneous injection IL-7 5 different dos ( 3 , 10 , 30 , 60 100 micro g/kg ) test sequentially . Four subject enroll dose level dose escalation occur subject complete four week without evidence dose-limiting toxicity review safety monitoring committee . Secondary end point include PK study rhIL7 well immunologic study throughout duration study assess evidence IL7 biologic activity marker T cell activation , proliferation differentiation well expression alpha chain IL7 receptor . This Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group ( AACTG ) study NIAID participate site . The NIAID site follow NIAID IRB reporting requirement grade 1 2 toxicity include annual review . Children exclude separate study require future safety biologic activity agent establish adult . The study enroll total 40-80 patient follow total eight week , approximately 15-20 anticipated enroll site .</detailed_description>
