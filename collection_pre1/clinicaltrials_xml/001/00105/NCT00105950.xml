	<brief_summary>This study design determine effective safe new investigational drug , lapatinib , treat patient treatment refractory relapse inflammatory breast cancer . Tumor tissue collect pre-treatment Day 28 examine biologic activity IHC ( immunohistochemistry ) . Treatment consist daily oral therapy lapatinib . A patient may continue treatment long receiving benefit . Blood sample hematology chemistry panel , MUGA/ECHO ( multigated acquisition/echocardiogram ) exams physical exam perform throughout study monitor safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of Lapatinib In Patients With Relapsed Or Refractory Inflammatory Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II open label , multicenter study design evaluate efficacy , safety , pharmacodynamic effect oral lapatinib administer single agent therapy patient relapse refractory inflammatory breast cancer . Eligible patient must diagnosis inflammatory breast cancer base clinicopathologic criterion , tumor readily accessible biopsy , must previously receive treatment anthracycline taxane-containing regimen ( 30 patient ) plus trastuzumab ( 90 patient ) . Patients enrol must tumor overexpress ErbB2 , without co-expression ErbB1 . The primary objective study evaluate objective response rate ( define complete response plus partial response ) . Secondary objective evaluate clinical benefit include quality life parameter , progression-free survival , overall survival , time-to-response , response duration , safety tolerability , pharmacodynamic effect intracellular mediator regulate tumor cell growth survival , well effect proteomic profile , circulate level extracellular domain ErbB1 ErbB2 peripheral blood .</detailed_description>
