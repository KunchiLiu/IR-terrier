	<detailed_description>22q11.2 ( DiGeorge MIM # 188400 , Velocardiofacial MIM # 192430 ) syndrome hemizygous microdeletion 22q11.2 typically 3Mb , encompass approximately 30 gene mediate aberrant homologous recombination unequal crossing-over event intrachromosomal flank low-copy repeat ( LCRs ) . The incidence 1:4000 live birth . While somatic symptom include congenital cardiovascular craniofacial abnormality , recurrent infection hypocalcemia1 , prevalent group symptom neuropsychiatric include cognitive dysfunction mild mental retardation , behavioral difficulty psychosis . The syndrome associate lifetime prevalence schizophrenia-like illness ( phenotypically mostly similar sporadic schizophrenia ) approximately 25 time general population make presence hemideletion strong know risk factor development schizophrenia except presence monozygotic twin illness . The 22q11 region implicate risk architecture schizophrenia several linkage study harbor number propose susceptibility gene include gene Catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) , proline dehydrogenase ( PRODH ) ZDHHC8 . The neural basis pronounce neurocognitive psychiatric abnormality unknown . The present work proposes ( ) study group exceptionally high-functioning , normal intelligence , psychosis-free individual 21q11.2 syndrome use hierarchical multimodal image approach define intermediate system level phenotype disease combine deletion map technique ( b ) study functional effect single nucleotide polymorphism gene hemideleted region implicate schizophrenia , take advantage unique fact hemizygous deletion allow immediate construction molecular haplotypes potential epistatic allelic effect . This work expect ( ) elucidate pathophysiology CNS manifestation 22q11.2 syndrome yield brain intermediate phenotype allow study small atypical deletion individual effort define individual gene responsible neurocognitive deficit increase risk psychosis , ( b ) facilitate identification functional mechanism underlie increase risk schizophrenia individual susceptibility gene deletion interact risk allele within delete locus ( c ) prepare ground clinical protocol result ( ) ( b ) apply prospective study evaluate early diagnostic interventional approach base genetic risk intermediate phenotype ascertainment group patient high risk development psychosis .</detailed_description>
