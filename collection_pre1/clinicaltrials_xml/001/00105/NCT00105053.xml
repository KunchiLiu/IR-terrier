	<brief_summary>This 2-phase study determine safety treat patient prostate cancer genetically engineer HyperAcute-Prostate cancer vaccine . It establish proper vaccine dose examine side effect potential benefit treatment . The vaccine contain kill prostate cancer cell contain mouse gene cause production foreign pattern protein-sugars cell surface . It hop immune response foreign substance stimulate immune system attack patient 's cancer cell similar protein without sugar pattern , cause tumor remain stable shrink . Patients 19 year age old hormone refractory prostate cancer recur long respond standard treatment may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , urinalysis , chest x-rays CT scan . MRI , PET , ultrasound scan may obtain need . Participants receive twelve vaccination two week apart . The vaccine inject skin , similar way tuberculosis skin test give . Phase I study treat successive group patient increase number vaccine cell evaluate side effect treatment determine optimum dose . Phase II look beneficial effect vaccine give high dose find safe Phase I . Monthly blood sample draw 6 month vaccine treatment . In addition , patient follow-up visit schedule every 2 month remain first year ( 6 month ) vaccination every 3 month next 2 year follow test procedure evaluate treatment response side effect : - Medical history physical examination - Blood test - X-rays various scan ( nuclear medicine/CT/MRI ) - FACT-P Assessment questionnaire measure impact treatment patient 's general well-being . The questionnaire administer begin treatment , monthly treatment , follow-up visit complete treatment . It include question severity prostate cancer symptom ability perform normal activity daily life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common type cancer find American men , skin cancer . The American Cancer Society estimate 230,900 new case prostate cancer United States year 2004 . About 29,900 men die disease . Prostate cancer second lead cause cancer death men , exceed lung cancer . This protocol attempt exploit approach prostate cancer immunotherapy use naturally occur barrier xenotransplantation human attempt vaccinate patient prostate cancer . The expression murine alpha ( 1,3 ) galactosyltransferase [ alpha ( 1,3 ) GT ] gene result cell surface expression alpha ( 1,3 ) galactosyl-epitopes ( alpha-gal ) membrane glycoprotein glycolipids . These epitope major target hyperacute rejection response occur organ transplant non-primate donor specie man . Human host often pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibody bind alpha-gal epitope lead rapid activation complement cell lysis . The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibody find individual think due exposure alpha-gal epitope naturally express normal gut flora lead chronic immunological stimulation . These antibody may comprise 1 % serum IgG . In Phase I/II trial , patient hormone refractory prostate cancer undergo series twelve intradermal injection vaccine compose irradiated allogeneic prostate cancer cell line ( HAP-1 HAP-2 ) transduce recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus ( MoMLV ) -based retroviral vector express murine alpha ( 1,3 ) GT gene . Endpoints study include determination dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , tumor immunological response .</detailed_description>
