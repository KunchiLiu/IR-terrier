	<brief_summary>This study explore risk cause Parkinson 's disease , chronic progressive nervous system disorder . Patients typically tremor , muscle weakness shuffle gait . Patients Parkinson 's disease , relatives healthy volunteer may eligible study . Candidates must 18 year age old . Patients whose parkinsonism due secondary cause , infection injury , healthy volunteer first degree family member ( parent , grandparent , child , sibling ) Parkinson 's disease exclude enrollment . Participants ask possible symptom may general health . They provide blood sample obtain DNA genetic analysis look genetic difference might relate risk Parkinson 's disease . White blood cell may treat laboratory grow cell line , provide source substance blood without draw sample repeatedly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) note familial component early 1880 . More recently , discovery several genetic factor influence Parkinson 's disease emphasize importance heredity PD . Objective : The goal protocol contribute genetic understand Parkinson 's disease . Clinical data collect order document feature Parkinson 's disease affect individual ( phenotyping ) . Genetic characterization undertaken discovery specific gene cause contribute risk Parkinson 's disease ( genotyping ) . Design : The study design two component . The first ( aim 1 ) involve positional clone gene discovery family apparent Mendelian inheritance . The second ( aim 2 ) utilize association study design , use genetic case-control method assessment genetic risk factor . We examine individual affect Parkinson 's disease family member towards Specific Aim 1 . Specific Aim 2 involve evaluation individual apparent sporadic Parkinson 's disease , also , healthy adult volunteer recruit control subject . Outcome Measures : Primary Outcome Measures Specific Aim 1 : 1 . The identification new gene causal Parkinson 's disease . 2 . The identification new mutation know gene . Primary Outcome Measures Specific Aim 2 : 1 . The discovery gene variant confer risk Parkinson 's disease . 2 . The validation already report polymorphisms risk factor PD . Secondary Outcome Measures ( Specific Aims 1 2 ) : Genotype/phenotype correlation specific genetic form Parkinson 's disease . For example , assess particular age onset , cardinal secondary feature PD associate clinical course associate give genotype . Future Direction : Because 1 ) large sample base great likelihood discovery gene minor effect 2 ) discovery genetic risk factor require validation additional sample series , likely renewal protocol seek five year . Study Population : We aim enroll total 2500 subject five year . These include approximately 500 sample Mendelian study ( Specific Aim 1 ) , 2000 association study ( Specific Aim 2 ) . These estimate base feasibility statistical power . Subjects evaluate NIH Clinical Center .</detailed_description>
