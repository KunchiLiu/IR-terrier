	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Removing Excess Iron From Heart</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multi-center , randomize , open-label , control clinical trial . The study population participant thalassemia major receive regular chelation therapy deferoxamine . A total sixty ( 60 ) participant enrol among investigative site . The primary objective study determine whether deferiprone exhibit superior efficacy remove excess iron heart compare standard therapy , deferoxamine . The secondary objective evaluate relative efficacy deferiprone respect deferoxamine assess serum ferritin concentration liver iron concentration . The primary efficacy measure study participant ' cardiac iron status , determine heart MRI T2* assessment . The secondary efficacy measure serum ferritin concentration liver iron concentration . This measure Superconducting Quantum-Interference Device ( SQUID ) BioSusceptometer . The duration treatment 12 month .</detailed_description>
