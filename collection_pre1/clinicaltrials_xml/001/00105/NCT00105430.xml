	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) treat primary generalize dystonia . Patients dystonia muscle spasm cause uncontrolled twist repetitive movement abnormal posture . Medical therapy available , patient get adequate relief abnormal movement pain associate . DBS surgical procedure interrupt neuronal circuit Gpi STN , area basal ganglia brain work correctly patient dystonia . The surgery result decrease movement therefore may lessen patient ' symptom pain . Patients 7 year age old generalize dystonia respond medical treatment may eligible study . Candidates screen blood urine test , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram patient 35 year age . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Magnetic resonance imaging . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . The patient lie table move scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The procedure usually last 45 90 minute , patient ask lie still 15 minute time . - Transcranial magnetic stimulation . This procedure map brain function . A wire coil hold scalp , brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . During stimulation , patient may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg , patient may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . During stimulation , electrical activity muscle record computer , use electrode attach skin tape . - Neurologic evaluation . Before DBS , patient 's dystonia , include voice strength difficulty swallowing , measure standardize rating scale . - DBS treatment . Patients randomly assign electrode implant either Gpi STN area basal ganglion . The electrodes stimulate brain DBS therapy . Before surgery , frame secure patient 's head , MRI scan do . DBS involve make two small incision two small hole skull , open line around brain , locate Gpi STN , secure electrode place connect pulse generator place skin collar bone . Additionally , surgery , patient ask move certain muscle . The muscle activity record gain well understanding physiology movement . After surgery , compute tomography ( CT ) MRI scan do confirm placement electrode . - Stimulation evaluation . After surgery , patient ' movement evaluate stimulation . The change movement function videotape score accord rating scale . The optimal stimulation setting determine stimulators adjust accordingly . - Follow-up . Patients evaluate , videotape , 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month surgery , stimulators adjust need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : For dystonic patient fail medical therapy , stereotactic deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) globus pallidus interna ( Gpi ) subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) provide significant symptom improvement , know site provide maximum benefit physiologic mechanisms improvement may occur . The study goal determine DBS Gpi STN provide significant clinical improvement patient primary generalized dystonia , whether anatomic DBS site ( either ) provide optimal improvement , gain deeper insight underlie pathophysiology disorder . STUDY POPULATION : Adult pediatric patient medically refractory primary generalize dystonia make-up study population . Patients primary generalize dystonia suffer wide range symptom include physical deformity , speech difficulty , swallow dysfunction , visual problem , intractable pain , result inability care . Moreover , pediatric primary generalize dystonia patient often abnormal skeletal development ( scoliosis ) result abnormal force place skeleton dystonic muscle contraction . DESIGN : We propose place DBS electrode ( use microelectrode guidance ) bilaterally either Gpi STN medically refractory dystonia patient . Physiological study perform compare clinical change understand mechanism action DBS underlie pathophysiology dystonia . OUTCOME MEASURES : Clinical effectiveness DBS Gpi STN measure Burke-Fahn-Marsden Scale ( BFM ) monitor time determine effectiveness DBS ideal anatomic stimulation site . Electrophysiologic outcome measure obtain determine underlie pathophysiology dystonia , mechanism action DBS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible entry study , candidate must meet following criterion : 1 . Patients great 7 year age generalize primary dystonia . 2 . Patients refractory medical treatment ( include levodopa , anticholinergic , benzodiazepine , Baclofen ) consider surgical candidate . Patients determine medical refractory dystonia treat least two medication two different group maximum recommend dose duration least two month . 3 . In case treatment intrathecal Baclofen deliver pump , change oral Baclofen must perform , pump take . 4 . Patients must minimum BFM score 20 optimal medical therapy . 5 . Adults must mentally competent consent entrance protocol time admission . 6 . Patients must sign DPA research purpose . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Candidates exclude : 1 . The patient previous lesioning surgery include radiofrequency lesioning deep nucleus ( thalamus , pallidum , STN ) . 2 . The patient currently function effective stimulator deep brain nucleus ( thalamus , pallidum , STN ) . 3 . The patient able tolerate surgery , determine preoperative evaluation . 4 .
