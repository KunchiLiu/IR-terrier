	<brief_summary>This study examine nitrite infusion affect exercise tolerance ( much person exercise stop ) . Exercise ability limit fast oxygen deliver body fast body produce energy . Both process affect nitric oxide ( NO ) , gas produce cell line blood vessel . NO important regulate blood vessel dilation , consequently , blood flow . Nitrite may act storehouse nitric oxide able improve exercise tolerance . Healthy normal volunteer 21 45 year age use exercise bicycle may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram , breathe test , blood test , pregnancy test woman able bear child . Pregnant woman exclude study . The screening session include practice exercise bicycle . Participants exercise stationery exercise bicycle 30 minute two study day . During test , breathe mouthpiece allow inhale exhaled respiratory gas measure . Before subject begin exercise , small tube place artery forearm inside elbow . A longer tube call central line place deep vein neck area numb . A thinner tube , call pulmonary artery catheter , place central line advance chamber heart , heart valve , lung artery . This catheter measure various pressure directly heart lung . Blood sample draw catheter also , avoid need multiple needle stick . Another tube place vein arm deliver medication . Thirty minute tubes place , blood sample drawn baseline measurement . Then , either saline ( sterile salt water ) nitrite inject tube arm vein . Thirty minute injection , subject start exercise bicycle . The work set bicycle increase every minute , subject pedal tire continue . During test , small blood sample collect every 2 minute . Heart rate , blood pressure , heart rhythm continuously monitor . After test first day , participant admit hospital rest remainder afternoon evening . The tubes kept place follow morning , procedure repeat exactly , except subject receive saline first day give nitrite second day , vice versa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During exercise , lag rate oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) rise meet energy demand . It uncertain whether limitation due inadequate O2 delivery work muscle , limitation rate mitochondrion generate ATP meet demand , combination . Both limitation may modulate nitric oxide . Nitric oxide ( NO ) implicate numerous physiological function , include control skeletal muscle vasodilation oxidative metabolism . During exercise , NO vasodilate skeletal muscle modulate ( inhibit ) mitochondrial respiration . The latter effect could either decrease oxygen extraction limit ability mitochondrion utilize oxygen , paradoxically increase oxygen utilization inhibit mitochondrion proximal blood vessel , effect facilitates oxygen diffusion distal tissue mitochondrion ( NO dependent facilitate oxygen diffusion ) . Previous study demonstrate NO production increase exercise regional inhibition NO production endothelial NO synthase reduce exercise-dependent blood flow approximately 10 % . NOS inhibitor N ( G ) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( L-NAME ) show decrease exercise tolerance , NO precursor ( L-arginine ) increase exercise tolerance . Administration inhale NO exercise show increase exercise tolerance . Considering potential role nitrite bioconversion NO hypoxia , likely nitrite play important role modulate exercise physiology . We therefore hypothesize aerobic , particular anaerobic exercise , erythrocyte plasma nitrite convert NO modulate muscle blood flow , mitochondrial respiration , oxygen diffusion ultimately maximal oxygen consumption . While expect effect increase maximal oxygen consumption increase work output , also distinctly possible NO production nitrite exercise inhibit mitochondrial respiration decrease maximal oxygen consumption . The purpose present study investigate effect aerobic-to-anaerobic exercise circulate nitrite store erythrocytes plasma arterial central venous circulation effect systemic nitrite infusion aerobic anaerobic exercise capacity . Physiological parameter include maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) , maximal CO2 NO production ( VCO2max VNOmax ) , maximal work , rate perceive exertion ( RPE ) , anaerobic threshold , pulmonary gas exchange ( VO2 , VCO2 , VE ) monitor exercise without nitrite infusion . Our primary endpoint VO2 max nitrite infusion compare VO2 max saline placebo infusion .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must 2145 year age . Subject must good health able perform cycle ergometry length study . Subjects must provide informed , write consent participation study .

Subjects history reaction medication substance characterize dyspnea cyanosis participate study . Subjects G6PD deficiency . Subjects baseline methemoglobin level great 1 % . Lactating female breastfeed , participate since nitrite cross breast milk could cause methemoglobinemia infant . No volunteer subject allow take medication ( oral contraceptive agent allow ) , vitamin supplement , herbal preparation , nutriceuticals alternative therapy least one month prior study allow take aspirin NSAIDs one week prior study . Subjects blood pressure le 100/70 mmHg study day exclude protocol .</criteria>
