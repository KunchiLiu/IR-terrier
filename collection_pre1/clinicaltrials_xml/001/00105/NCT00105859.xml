	<detailed_description>Background : Pressure ulcer serious , costly , life-long complication spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Pressure ulcer prevalence estimate 17 33 % among person SCI reside community . Epidemiological study find 36-50 % person SCI develop pressure ulcer develop recurrence within first year initial healing ( Carlson et al. , 1992 ; Fuhrer et al. , 1993 ; Goldstein , 1998 ; Niazi et al. , 1997 ; Salzberg et al . 1998 ) . Recurrence rate range 21 % 79 % , regardless treatment ( Schryvers et al. , 2000 ; Goodman et al. , 1999 ; Niazi et al. , 1997 ) . Pressure ulcer treatment expensive . Surgical cost associated pressure ulcer treatment exceed $ 70,000 per case ( Braun et al. , 1992 ) . VA administrative ( National Patient Care Database , NPCD ) data indicate 41 % inpatient day SCI population account either primary secondary diagnosis pressure ulcer 23 % SCI inpatient day restrict primary diagnosis pressure ulcer . Pressure ulcer recurrence associate many factor include previous pressure ulcer surgery ( Niazi et al. , 1997 ) . Although little data exist describe factor associate recurrence follow surgery , investigator report recurrence rate 11 % -29 % case post-operative complication 6 % 61 % case without post-operative complication ( Mandrekas &amp; Mastorakos , 1992 ; Relander &amp; Palmer , 1988 ; Disa et al. , 1992 ) . In retrospective study 48 veteran SCI , investigator report 79 % recurrence rate follow surgery ( Goodman et al. , 1999 ) . Objectives : The purpose project identify effective intervention reduce recurrent pressure ulcer , severe costly complication veteran SCI . The effect educational structure telephone counsel follow-up program prevention health care utilization evaluate . Hypotheses include follow : 1 ) After discharge hospital treatment severe heal pelvic pressure ulcer , patient receive education structure telephone counseling intervention would significantly less likely develop new recurrent severe ( e.g. , Stage III IV ) , pelvic ( define study occur sacrum , coccyx , trochanter , ischium ) pressure ulcer receive customary care . 2 ) Admissions inpatient day severe pelvic pressure ulcer significantly low veteran receive education structure telephone counsel intervention compare receive customary care . Methods : Veterans admit 6 VA SCI Centers medical and/or surgical treatment Stage III IV pelvic pressure ulcer ( sacrum , coccyx , trochanter ischium ) randomly assign ( 1 ) Intervention Group consist education plus structured telephone counsel follow-up ( 2 ) Customary Care ( Control ) group . Intervention Group subject receive cognitive behavioral intervention base Trans-theoretical Stages Change Model , design help individual identify way improve health behavior . On admission , interviewer collect information demographic , health status/well , locus control , pressure ulcer knowledge , readiness-to-change , health beliefs/practices . Some measure re-administered prior randomization 9 18 month post-discharge . Health care utilization monitor participant length study . The primary outcome ( dependent ) variable ( 1 ) occurrence non-occurrence another pelvic pressure ulcer within 18 month discharge follow healing , ( 2 ) individual develop pressure ulcer study period , time recurrence . Intervention Group participant expect few pressure ulcer-related admission , admit , short hospital stay . Secondary outcome include health care utilization , pressure ulcer prevention knowledge , medical psychological health status , health belief practice , quality life . Multi-variate logistic model use examine factor associate recurrence evaluate impact recurrence health care utilization . Status : A total 64 patient randomize study , 33 customary care 31 intervention group . Most male , white , married SCI thoracic level result paraplegia . Mean time recurrence 114.50 day total randomized subject . All data 15 questionnaire analyze put manuscript publication future time .</detailed_description>
