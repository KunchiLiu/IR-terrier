	<brief_title>EZ-2053 Prophylaxis Acute Pulmonary Allograft Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients generally consent study go lung transplant wait list re-consented periodically thereafter undergo lung transplant surgery . A pre-surgical assessment consist medical history , physical exam , ECG , chest X-Ray , blood test conduct . After lung transplant surgery , patient assess continued eligibility . Within 6-24 hour end surgery , patient randomize receive one infusion study drug placebo central venous catheter . Each day 5 day follow transplant surgery , patient monitor transplant rejection , infection , adverse event laboratory test change . On post-randomization Days 14 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 180 , 270 365 , patient monitor acute transplant rejection , infection cancer , pulmonary function test adverse experience . Pulmonary biopsy perform post-randomization Days 30 , 60 , 90 , 180 365 . Blood sample draw visit .</detailed_description>
