Typically , parent guardian permission research minor may solicit research substantially great minimal risk unless direct benefit minor risk-benefit ratio least good available alternative . There also special consideration involvement adolescent research need parent adolescent may conflict term concern privacy . Studies suggest simplify language use short sentence enhance understanding . Other study support use visual aid enhance adolescent understand enable adolescent give truly informed consent . The aim project randomize adolescent risk HIV either simplify adolescent-friendly prototype condition , standard condition order determine : 1. adolescent assign simplified , adolescent-tailored prototype condition significantly good comprehension score assign standard condition ; 2. adolescent assign simplified , adolescent-tailored prototype condition significantly well recall score assign standard condition ; 3. willingness participate vaccine trial significantly different among adolescent assign simplified condition compare standard condition .</detailed_description>
