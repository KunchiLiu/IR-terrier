	<brief_summary>This study compare side effect two treatment diabetic macular edema , blood vessel retina ( tissue line back eye ) become leaky retina macula ( center part retina responsible fine vision ) swell , cause vision loss . Patients 18 year age old diabetes mellitus macular edema one eye may eligible study . Candidates screen follow test procedure : - Blood pressure measurement . - Blood test measure HbA1c , measure patient 's diabetes control . - Eye examination assess visual acuity eye pressure , examine pupil , lens , retina eye movement . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Eye photography help evaluate status retina change may occur future . Photographs inside eye take use camera flash bright light eye . - Electroretinograms ( ERG ) measure electrical response generate retina . Wearing eye patch , patient sits dark room 30 minute . Then , electrode tap forehead earlobe . The eye patch remove , surface eye numb eye drop , contact lens place eye . The patient look inside white globe emits series light flash 20 minute . The contact lenses sense small electrical signal generate retina light flash . - Optical coherence tomography measure retinal thickness . The eye examine machine produce cross-sectional picture retina . These measurement repeat study determine whether retinal thicken improving , worsen , stay . Patients macular edema eye receive laser therapy one eye triamcinolone injection . Patients one affect eye randomly assign receive either laser triamcinolone treatment . Those receive laser therapy may later receive triamcinolone injection second eye , , develop macular edema . For laser treatment , eye surface numbed drop contact lens place eye laser beam application . Before treatment , patient may fluorescein angiography , picture retina take use yellow dye . The dye inject vein travel blood vessel eye . The camera flash blue light eye take picture show amount dye leakage retina . This help guide laser treatment . Patients return follow-up visit every 4 month 3 year . If macular edema go , additional treatment give patient follow often every 2 month . If edema return , additional treatment may do subsequent visit . Patients whose vision worsen considerably end 1 year may treat steroid injection , unless eye also treat triamcinolone . For triamcinolone injection , numb drop , antibiotic drop , drop dilate pupil , possibly anesthetic injection , put eye medicine inject vitreous ( jelly-like substance inside eye ) . Then , patient lie back 30 minute discharge home . Patients return follow-up visit 4 day 4 week injection , every 4 month 3 year . Patients whose edema resolve follow often every 2 month . Those whose edema return additional injection 4-month visit . Patients whose condition improve 1 year whose vision worsen may undergo laser treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Diabetic Macular Edema : Triamcinolone Injections Vs. Laser Photocoagulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy major cause visual impairment United States . Diabetic Macular edema ( DME ) manifestation diabetic retinopathy produce loss central vision . Data Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study Diabetic Retinopathy ( WESDR ) estimate 15 year know diabetes , prevalence diabetic macular edema approximately 20 % patient type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , 25 % patient type 2 DM take insulin , 14 % patient type 2 DM take insulin . In review three early study concern natural history diabetic macular edema , Ferris Patz find 53 % 135 eye diabetic macular edema , presumably involve center macula , lose two line visual acuity two year period . In Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) , 33 % 221 untreated eye available follow-up 3-year visit , edema involve center macula baseline , experience 15 letter decrease visual acuity score ( equivalent double visual angle , e.g. , 20/25 20/50 , term moderate visual loss ) . The frequency unsatisfactory outcome follow laser photocoagulation eye diabetic macular edema prompt interest treatment modality . One treatment par plana vitrectomy . These study suggest vitreomacular traction , vitreous , may play role increase retinal vascular permeability . Removal vitreous relief mechanical traction vitrectomy membrane stripping may follow substantial resolution macular edema correspond improvement visual acuity . However , treatment may applicable specific subset eye diabetic macular edema . It also require complex surgical intervention inherent risk , recovery time , expense . Other treatment modality pharmacologic therapy oral protein kinase C inhibitor antibody target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) investigation . The use intravitreal corticosteroid another treatment modality generate recent interest .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : ( SubjectLevel ) To eligible , follow inclusion criterion ( 16 ) must meet : 1 . Age great equal 18 year . 2 . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) . Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes Documented diabetes ADA and/or WHO criteria 3 . At least one eye meet study eye criterion . 4 . If one eye eligible , fellow eye meet criteria 5 . Able willing provide inform consent . 6 . Patient understands ( 1 ) eye eligible time randomization , one eye receive intravitreal triamcinolone ancetonide one eye receive laser , ( 2 ) one eye eligible time randomization fellow eye develop DME later , fellow eye receive intravitreal triamcinolone ancetonide study eye receive intravitreal triamcinolone ancetonide ( however , study eye assign laser group , fellow eye may treat 4mg dose study intravitreal triamcinolone ancetonide formulation , provide eye assign laser received intravitreal injection ; eye study eye since receive study drug , follow adverse effect ) . ( SubjectLevel ) A patient eligible follow exclusion criterion ( 713 ) present : 7 . History chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . 8 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . Patients poor gylcemic control , within last 4 month , initiate intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) plan next 4 month enrol . 9 . Participation investigational trial within 30 day study entry involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval time study entry . 10 . Known allergy corticosteroid component delivery vehicle . 11 .
