	<brief_title>The Standard Care vs. COrticosteroid REtinal Vein Occlusion ( SCORE ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Macular edema major cause vision loss patient CRVO BRVO . Both CRVO BRVO common retinal problem cause blockage one large retinal vein ( central retinal vein occlusion - CRVO ) small retinal vein ( branch retinal vein occlusion - BRVO ) . Currently , effective treatment macular edema associate CRVO standard care treatment observation . Grid laser photocoagulation may effective patient macular edema associate BRVO , many patient derive limited benefit treatment . Therefore , development new treatment modality macular edema cause two condition important research goal . Over last several year , many patient macular edema CRVO BRVO treat injection type steroid call triamcinolone directly eye . This type injection call intravitreal injection . The triamcinolone preparation commonly inject eye Kenalog FDA-approved use muscle joint . The SCORE Study use formulation triamcinolone make specifically eye . The SCORE Study multicenter , randomize , Phase III trial compare effectiveness safety standard care versus triamcinolone injection ( ) treatment macular edema associate CRVO BRVO . In two disease area , 630 participant randomize ( similar flip coin ) 1:1:1 ratio one three group : standard care , intravitreal triamcinolone 4 mg , intravitreal triamcinolone 1 mg. After randomization , participant examine every 4 month 3 year collect ophthalmic information , include visual acuity , intraocular pressure , optical coherence tomography , fundus photography . Fluorescein angiography perform 4 , 12 24 month . Repeat intravitreal injection triamcinolone repeat laser treatment provide clinically indicate base protocol-specific guideline . The primary outcome improvement 15 letter baseline best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score 12-month visit . Secondary outcome include change baseline best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score , change retinal thickness assess stereoscopic color fundus photography optical coherence tomography , adverse ocular outcome .</detailed_description>
