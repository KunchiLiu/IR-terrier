	<brief_summary>The widespread availability screen couple high risk diagnosis , treatment , rise risk die compete cause death pose major challenge prostate cancer patient health care system . Data outcome identification patient likely benefit therapy urgently need empower patient health professional allocate limited health resource wisely . The long-term goal population-based study improve prostate cancer care elderly patient . In 2004 , approximately thirty percent 230,110 new prostate cancer case diagnose men age 75 .

While value primary androgen deprivation localize prostate cancer remain questionable , treatment widely use among elderly patient . Currently , insufficient outcome data guide treatment choice elderly patients.The follow key background consideration provide rationale propose project : · Prostate cancer prevalent among elderly men . · Over diagnosis compete cause death important issue elderly men prostate cancer.· Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) increasingly use primary therapy among elderly patient localize disease· There insufficient outcome data support use primary androgen deprivation non metastatic prostate cancer· Preliminary dataThe study population sub-project sub-sample large study ( IRB # 5177 ) research method identical study .</brief_summary>
