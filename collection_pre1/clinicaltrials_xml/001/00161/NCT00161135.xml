	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate overlap difference autism MCDD neuropsychiatric childhood disorder . MRI scan acquire subject autism , subject diagnosis MCDD typically develop control . Volumetric measure various brain region compare group . We hypothesize subject autism large brain control , whereas subject MCDD small brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism Childhood-onset Schizophrenia clearly define neuropsychiatric disorder since study Kolvin Rutter . In early seventy discussion possible overlap two type disorder vanish , nowadays issue revives . Amongst advance DSM diagnostic criterion , omission developmental information appear disadvantage . The Pervasive Developmental Spectrum broad spectrum , exception Autism characteristic disorder , large extent consist ill-defined restcategory . Most patient actually belong last category , so-called PDD-NOS group . In recent year publish subgroup within large group . One subgroup , Multiple Complex Developmental Disorder ( MCDD ) , appear well defined category patient whose validity confirm research . In adulthood , large percentage MCDD group seem develop Schizophrenia Schizophrenia relate disorder . This arise question possible overlap . This discussion even emphasize report notably -mostly retrospective- study premorbid autistic feature patient Schizophrenia . In present day study neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder , search biological marker discriminate factor . One applied method structural imaging . Question mark place differ study set-ups protocol seriously hinder inter alia comparison . However one still conclude result study subject Autism Childhood-onset Schizophrenia reveal major difference . However , structural abnormality tell anything possible functional abnormality . But detect structural abnormality helpful forming hypothesis origin neurodevelopmental disorder . In study brain structure measure magnetic resonance imaging . Structural deviance interpret reflection functional abnormality . It hypothesize abnormality structural image MCDD patient resemble abnormality find literature ( Childhood-onset ) Schizophrenia instead deviances revealed subject Autism . In study patient Autism MCDD divide two group : puberty . Each group behold 15-40 subject . They compare two group 20-25 age , sex IQ match control . They participate carry MRI scan , filling questionnaire necessary IQ test general physical examination.The MRI scan measure , compare order find ‘ disorder-specific ’ abnormality .</detailed_description>
