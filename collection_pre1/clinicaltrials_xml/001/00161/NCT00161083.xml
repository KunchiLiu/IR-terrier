	<brief_title>UDCA Symptomatic Gallstone Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gallstone disease common estimate prevalence 10-15 % adult Western population . Approximately 90 % gallstone carrier asymptomatic . The annual risk biliary colic asymptomatic gallstone carrier suggest approximately 1 % . Also , asymptomatic gallstone carrier risk acute pancreatitis , choledocholithiasis acute cholecystitis . Although accurate prospective data lacking , annual incidence potentially lethal complication estimate approximately 0.2 % , 0.2 % 0.3 % , respectively . One easily imagine migration gallbladder stone common bile duct may lead biliary pain . How gallbladder stone remain gallbladder lead biliary symptom entirely clear . Strong gallbladder contraction , temporary impaction stone orifice cystic duct might cause biliary pain . Although impaired gallbladder motility could therefore theoretically protect colic , symptomatic gallbladder stone patient often complaints despite coexistent impaired gallbladder empty . Ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) claim reduce risk biliary pain , regardless gallstone dissolution . In large study Tomida et al. , risk biliary pain gallstone complication ( acute cholecystitis ) reduce symptomatic asymptomatic gallstone carrier , although gallstone generally dissolve . Also , biliary pancreatitis might prevent long-term UDCA treatment . Increased fast residual postprandial gallbladder volume UDCA treatment , less cholesterol crystal decrease mucin content bile could underlie mechanisms beneficial effect . However , prospective study effect UDCA symptom complication highly symptomatic patient lack . In Netherlands symptomatic gallstone patient admit wait list elective cholecystectomy general surgeon . The wait period may last several month logistic reason . During wait period gallstone patient risk biliary pain complication . Therefore , conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial effect UDCA biliary pain complication highly symptomatic gallstone patient schedule cholecystectomy . We also evaluate potential beneficial effect impaired gallbladder motility</detailed_description>
