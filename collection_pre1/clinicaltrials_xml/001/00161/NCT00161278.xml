	<brief_summary>Patients least 18 year age type cancer know advanced non-small cell lung cancer may eligible study meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Background : The standard treatment patient advance non-small cell cancer chemotherapy . The two drug combination , carboplatin ( Paraplatin ) paclitaxel ( Taxol ) , commonly use first treatment . Unfortunately , standard treatment chemotherapy shrink cancer 30 % patient receive . There way predict wo n't benefit treatment . The researcher University Michigan would like determine gene lung cancer patient enrol study help predict whether tumor shrink expose standard chemotherapy . The goal find set lung cancer gene predict successful treatment carboplatin paclitaxel patient non-small cell lung cancer . The actual treatment , carboplatin paclitaxel , involve study experimental . The experimental aspect study identification predictor response treatment . To , would require sample cancer . If initial surgery biopsy do University Michigan , may already adequate sample cancer could use research . In case , ask permission use sample study . However , meet eligibility criterion agree participate research study adequate sample available , need undergo another biopsy procedure u obtain sample cancer . Obtaining tumor sample crucial part research study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Determination Tumor Response Chemotherapy Advanced NSCLC Through Gene Expression Profiling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior start treatment , subject complete history physical examination blood test evaluate overall health . The doctor also obtain tissue sample ( biopsy ) tumor take subject 's body evaluate gene express within tumor . Doctors University Michigan analysis tissue understand genetic nature subject 's tumor . If subject 's initial surgery biopsy do University Michigan , may already adequate sample cancer could use research . In case , would ask permission use sample study . However , subject agree participate research study adequate sample available , need undergo another biopsy procedure u obtain sample cancer . A biopsy subject 's tumor obtain various site body use number different method . We select location easy safe place biopsy , provide adequate sample tumor tissue . Biopsy sit generally superficial ( example , lymph node , skin nodule , chest wall tumor ) . The usual method biopsy placement large needle tumor obtain `` core '' tissue . In situation , may ask superficial tumor remove whole part minor surgical procedure . If neither method do safely , may place thin needle tumor aspirate ( suck ) tumor cell study . All procedure do local anesthesia ( , injection medication directly biopsy site numb area prior biopsy ) appropriate care avoid excessive bleeding subsequent infection . The doctor explain specific biopsy location technique fit subject 's situation detail prior procedure . They decide go biopsy withdraw research trial time . Subjects give carboplatin paclitaxel intravenously ( vein ) 2 hour . This repeat every three week total six eighteen week . Three week consider `` cycle '' subject receive 1 6 cycle depend tumor responds treatment tolerate . Treatment stop tumor get bad subject develops unacceptable side-effects . Physical examination , blood test , x-rays and/or scan do routinely therapy doctor check subject 's body tumor response treatment . Blood sample , consist 2-3 teaspoonful ( 10-15 cc ) , obtain twice every three week study evaluate effect treatment blood count , blood electrolyte , liver kidney function .</detailed_description>
