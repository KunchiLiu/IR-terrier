	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Imatinib mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving gemcitabine together imatinib mesylate may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gemcitabine together imatinib mesylate work first-line therapy treat patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Imatinib Mesylate First-Line Therapy Patients With Locally Adv . Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate time progression patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer treat gemcitabine hydrochloride imatinib mesylate first-line therapy . Secondary - Assess response rate patient treat regimen . - Assess percentage patient treat regimen survive 1 year . - Assess toxicity regimen patient . - Assess overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , nonrandomized , open-label , uncontrolled study . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 120 minute day 3 10 oral imatinib mesylate day 1-5 8-12 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 42 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
