	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess seropersistence TBE antibodies child adolescent age 1 15 year time first vaccination , 24 month 34 month completion primary immunization FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml ( 3 vaccination predecessor study 209 ) , well immune response booster vaccination FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml administer 36 month third vaccination ( Study 209 ) . Protocol amendment October 2006 : The study prolong child adolescent still show highly positive TBE virus antibody concentration approximately 3 year third vaccination therefore receive booster vaccination time point . Further follow-up TBE antibody persistence include subject 46 58 month third vaccination ( Study 209 ) , well booster vaccination offer either 48 60 month third vaccination ( Study 209 ) , depend individual TBE antibody level .</brief_summary>
