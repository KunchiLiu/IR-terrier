	<detailed_description>I . INTRODUCTION Primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) progressive cholestatic liver disease characterize multifocal stricture intrahepatic extrahepatic bile duct , frequently lead biliary cirrhosis liver failure . The aetiology PSC unknown thought ( auto ) immune-mediated . Nevertheless , number randomize controlled trial clear benefit treatment various immunosuppressive agent , D-penicillamine , methotrexate , corticosteroid nicotine , could demonstrate . Although treatment ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) improve serum liver test prescribe large scale PSC patient , therapeutic modality may beneficial effect course disease . 70 - 90 % patient PSC concurrent inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , mostly ulcerative colitis . Conversely , 7 % patient IBD PSC . The close association inflammatory bowel disease PSC suggest substance originate inflamed gut may damage liver biliary tree . Bacterial product may act toxic proinflammatory agent . N-formyl L-methionine L-leucine L-tyrosine peptide produce enteric flora . When peptide introduce colon rat colitis , absorb , underwent enterohepatic circulation , appear undegraded bile . Histologic change liver rat resemble PSC . Probiotics beneficial bacteria use redress bacterial composition enteric flora may alter disease . Beneficial effect probiotic already describe disease inflammatory bowel disease , pouchitis non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Probiotic bacteria also show counteract inflammatory process enhance degradation enteral antigen , reduce secretion inflammatory mediator , thereby modify beneficial way balance pro- anti-inflammatory mediator , stabilize gut barrier function . These effect may benefit PSC patient . Our hypothesis administration probiotic may improve composition enteric flora subsequently decrease release substance may toxic harmful liver biliary tree PSC patient . Furthermore , immunological alteration induce treatment probiotic may positive effect PSC . II . AIM OF THE STUDY Primary aim : assessment effect treatment probiotic serum liver test . Secondary aim : assessment effect treatment probiotic fatigue pruritus . III . DESIGN OF THE STUDY Double-blind randomize cross-over pilot study . Eligible patient randomize treatment probiotic placebo period 12 week . After wash-out period 4 week , placebo-treated patient receive verum vice versa another period 12 week . Dosage concurrent medication PSC ( UDCA , immunosuppressives ) remain entire study period . Patients treat antibiotic study period 1 week withdrawn study .</detailed_description>
