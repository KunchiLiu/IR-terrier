	<brief_summary>In project , try identify patient earliest sign abnormality line low part food pipe ( esophagus ) know intestinal metaplasia ( IM ) ; also commonly call Barrett 's esophagus Barrett 's Epithelium ( BE ) . IM sometimes difficult diagnose routine microscopic examination ( call histology ) . We develop specific antibody , protein call immunoglobulin specifically react another partner protein , exist . Using marker antibody ( call mAb Das-1 ) patent ( US patent # 5,888,743 ) , show marker detect abnormal change distal esophagus evident histology . IM usually develop face long-term acid reflux stomach esophagus cause line change normal squamous type ( like skin ) type line normally see small intestine colon . A subgroup patient IM may , subsequently , develop histologically evident Barrett 's Epithelium small percent patient may develop cancer esophagus . Thus , BE consider pre-cancerous condition . We already ongoing IRB portion project involve take biopsy perform antibody stain identify patient react antibody histologically negative BE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esophageal Metaplasia Using Novel Antibody : Reversibility Proton Pump Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose study prospectively 68 patient identify positive mAb DAS-1 immunostaining without histological evidence specialize columnar epithelium ( `` True Barrett 's '' epithelium ) routine endoscopy dyspepsia GERD symptom . These patient study initial screen antibody stain IRB protocol # 1698 . This number base statistical analysis Fisher 's exact test 90 % power detect 30 % negativity ( mAb Das-1 positive negative ) p &lt; 0.05 level . During participation IRB Protocol # 1698 , initial biopsy specimens take : - squamo-columnar junction ( least 2 site - 12 o'clock 6 o'clock position area mucosal `` tongue '' columnar epithelium ) , - one squamous epithelium distal esophagus seek presence esophagitis , - one antrum presence absence intestinal metaplasia stomach , - one gastric cardia . Following endoscopy participation IRB Protocol # 1698 , symptomatic patient take proton pump inhibitor , H2 blocker , Ranitidine ( Zantac√í ) 150 mg twice daily , start biopsy analyze histology immunocytochemical staining . This usually complete within 2 week . Patients show positive reactivity least one biopsy sample take participation Protocol # 1698 mAb Das-1 include study . Patients take proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) longer 3 month preceeding study entry eligible participate study . Patients take proton pump inhibitor 3 month less time endoscopy biopsy screen mAb Das-1 , may participate study 4 week discontinue PPI ( i.e. , 4 week washout period ) . Patients randomize double-blinded fashion receive either Pantoprazole , 40 mg twice daily ( 34 patient ) , continue Ranitidine , 150 mg twice daily ( 34 patient ) total period 6 month . Pantoprazole Ranitidine provide Wyeth code keep pharmacy department The Cancer Institute New Jersey . The drug provide free cost patient entire period . Patients follow out-patients three-month interval 6 month . Patients advise return unused capsule follow-up visit . The number unused capsule well review patient 's medication diary allow assessment non-compliance . Patients must least 75 % compliant remain study . If patient complains persistent symptom , effort make provide relief antacid , much need . However , patient still symptomatic , take study unblinded . If patient Ranitidine switch open label Pantoprazole follow treated routine manner . If patient take Pantoprazole , pH monitoring document acid reflux plan management determine . All patient follow-up endoscopy 6 month , cost patient . This cost born grant receive Dr. Das . Additional endoscopy perform 12 month 24 month , current `` standard care '' procedure surveillance patient . Follow-up biopsy specimen take way initial specimen process see change histology mAb Das-1 reactivity .</detailed_description>
