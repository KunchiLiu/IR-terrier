	<brief_summary>The purpose research study compare efficacy safety high dos rituximab combination standard dose Rituxan + CVP ( Cyclophosphamide , Vincristine , Prednisone ) patient chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( ITP respond relapse standard dos rituximab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Treat Patients With ITP Who Do Not Achieve Durable Response Rituxan Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1 . Efficacy : The primary objective ( primary endpoint ) determine rate response ( partial complete response ) week 16 ( ± 2 ) post-treatment pilot arm : high dose Rituximab ( HDR ) group ( 750 mg/m2 x 4 ) group treat regimen combine standard dos Rituximab CVP ( R-CVP . ) A complete response ( CR ) platelet count increase ³ 150,000/mL two consecutive occasion one week apart , without therapy . A partial response consider platelet count increase 50 150,000/mL . 2 . Safety : To assess compare incidence moderate severe adverse-events include number type infection arm study use Genentech standard safety monitor serious adverse event ( SAE ) reporting . Secondary Objectives 1 . To compare response rate 2 treatment arm `` Rituximab non-responders '' sub group ( see 4.1 definition ) 2 . To compare response rate 2 treatment arm `` Rituximab relapsers '' subgroup 3 . To assess mean duration response ( PR CR ) 2 treatment arm . 4 . To evaluate duration low absent peripheral blood B cell two treatment arm . 5 . To assess incidence hypogammaglobulinemia ( IgG and/or IgM level &lt; ½ low limit normal age ) white blood count two arm .</detailed_description>
