	<brief_summary>The objective study demonstrate equivalent hemostatic efficacy safety FS VH S/D TISSEEL VH fibrin sealant subject undergoing cardiac surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass . If bleeding still present conventional surgical method achieve hemostasis apply FS VH S/D Tisseel VH apply . Achievement hemostasis within 5 minute compare study group .</brief_summary>
