	<detailed_description>Participants schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder competent participate inform consent process provide write informed consent enrol study . Participants undergo psychiatric evaluation , include ascertainment demographic information , past psychiatric treatment history , Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ; First et al , 1997 ) diagnostic interview . A best estimate diagnostic approach utilized information SCID supplement information family informant , previous psychiatrist , medical record generate diagnosis . Clinical Assessments : The symptom assessment include Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ; Overall Gorham , 1961 ) ; Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ; Andreasen , 1982 ) ; Clinical Global Impression Scale ( CGI ; Guy , 1976 ) . ) BPRS : four positive symptom item - conceptual disorganization , suspiciousness , hallucinatory behavior , unusual thought content - used measure positive psychotic symptom . These four item use assess positive symptom previous study ( Kane et al , 1988 ; Buchanan et al , 1998 ) . The BPRS Anxiety/Depression Factor , consist somatic concern , anxiety , guilt feeling , depression item , use ass dysphoria ( Guy , 1976 ) . The BPRS hostility uncooperativeness item use assess hostility . We include suspiciousness item , traditionally part BPRS Hostility Factor ( Guy , 1976 ) , include item positive symptom item . ii ) SANS : SANS total score , minus global item , inappropriate affect , poverty content speech , attention item , use measure negative symptom . The inappropriate affect , poverty content speech , attention item exclude lack construct validity factor analytic study result suggest item closely related negative symptom ( Buchanan Carpenter , 1994 ) . iii ) CGI : CGI severity illness item use ass global change . Safety Assessments : The safety assessment include Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale ( SAS ; Simpson Angus , 1970 ) ; Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) ( Guy , 1976 ) ; Barnes Akathisia Scale ( BAS ; Barnes , 1989 ) Side Effect Checklist ( SEC ) . ) SAS : modify 11-item version SAS use assess EPS . ii ) AIMS : 12-item scale , 7 item design assess abnormal facial , oral , extremity , trunk movement ; 3 global judgement item ; 2 current dental status item . iii ) BAS : 4 item scale assess objective subjective symptom akathisia . iv ) SEC : design ass vital sign commonly occur antipsychotic side effect . v ) Changes total body weight , body mass index , lipid profile , serum glucose . Neurocognitive Assessments : The following neuropsychological test administer : ( 1 ) reaction time , process speed efficiency , work memory-Digit Symbol , Number Sequencing , Letter Number Sequencing , Mental Arithmetic , Grooved Pegboard , Simple Reaction Time , Complex Reaction Time , Delayed Match Sample Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric ; ( 2 ) sustain attention resistance distractibility-Gordon 's Continuous Performance Test ; ( 3 ) learn memory-California Verbal Learning Test Brief Visual Memory Test ; ( 4 ) executive functioning- Planning Test Phonemic Fluency . 2-Week Stabilization Phase : In 2-week stabilization phase , participant undergo baseline symptom , medical , safety , neurocognitive assessment . The participant undergo physical examination ; EKG ; laboratory test major organ function ( i.e. , CBC , liver function test , electrolyte , glucose , BUN/Creatinine , Urinanalysis ( UA ) , thyroid function ) . A baseline antipsychotic level collect . All woman pregnancy test . 8-Week Double-Blind Treatment Phase : Participants randomly assign atomoxetine placebo use permuted block randomization system . Treatment assignment order random within block , total number participant assign treatment equal . The block size vary random sequence 2 4 . Thus , difficult ascertain next treatment assignment , even participant becomes unblinded , imbalance number treatment group keep within tight limit . The central unblinded pharmacist notify treatment assignment , inform unblinded pharmacist site study medication dispense . Separate emergency unblinding envelope participant keep locked cabinet dispense pharmacy . In addition , emergency unblinding tool allow specific , designated staff ( i.e. , P.I . Co-P.I . ) log onto randomization data base MPRC computer network request treatment assignment specific participant . An electronic audit trail keep unblinding request . All unused unblinding envelope must return unopened central pharmacy end study . Participants receive biweekly BPRS , SANS , SAS , BAS , AIMS , Side effect , vital sign assessment . Neurocognitive assessment perform week 0 week 8 endpoint . Laboratory test , antipsychotic level , EKG repeat 8 week . Medication Titration Schedule : The target atomoxetine dose study 80 mg/day . The following titration schedule use : Week 1-2 : atomoxetine 40 mg/day ; Week 3-8 : atomoxetine 80 mg/day . This titration schedule serve enhance tolerability minimize side effect . Participants randomize placebo receive equal number placebo tablet titration schedule . Concomitant Medications : Participants study allow continue medication regimen take prior trial . This allow result generalizable . Patients must stabilize single second generation antipsychotic , exclude clozapine , unchanged dose least 4 week prior randomization . All participant must stable dose psychotropic medication least 4 week prior randomization . No medication change change dose permit study period . Because atomoxetine 's noradrenergic activity 's modest ability cause increase blood pressure , participant drug potential vasopressor effect , venlafaxine monoamine oxidase inhibitor , exclude . Participants allow need ( PRN ) benztropine ( 1-6mg/day ) extrapyrmidal symptom , lorazepam ( 1-6 mg/day ) anxiety , agitation akathisia , chloral hydrate sleep ( 500-1000 mg/day ) . To minimize effect PRN medication test result , participant receive PRN medication 12 hour prior neurocognitive testing . Additionally , participant request use benztopine antiparkinson agent first assess movement rating scale document presence EPS prior receive antiparkinson agent receive antiparkinson agent within 12 hour prior movement assessment . Participants require routine use benztropine lorazepam exclude withdrawn study . Maintenance Blind : For outpatient , study medication dispense biweekly basis . They give two extra day medication case miss appointment . Inpatient subject receive study medication daily either Spring Grove Hospital Center TRU Perry Point VAMHC central pharmacy . An unblinded pharmacist site dispense study medication . The blind broken medical emergency require information . If occurs , participant withdrawn study . All raters , investigator staff blind treatment assignment except pharmacist . The pharmacist participate assess primary symptom side effect dependent variable conveys information treatment assignment participant staff except medical emergency . Compliance : Participants receive 75 % assign medication consider compliant . The 75 % criterion ensure participant receive adequate treatment evaluate comparative efficacy atomoxetine placebo . Outpatient compliance monitor weekly pill count subject interview . Medications dispense weekly basis dispense compliance assessed assessment complete . Inpatient compliance monitor inpatient medication record . If participant observe compliance problem , discuss participant plan formulate bring participant back within compliance parameter . For outpatient , plan may include contact participant 's caretaker scheduling increase clinic visit . These monitoring procedure use MPRC study result high level compliance . Compliance pattern carefully monitor treatment group describe part presentation study result .</detailed_description>
