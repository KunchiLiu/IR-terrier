	<brief_title>An Open-Label Investigation Adjuvant Therapeutic Effects Galantamine Patients With Chronic Schizophrenia Persistent Deficit Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In exploratory investigation , propose study adjuvant therapeutic efficacy safety galantamine 20 patient chronic schizophrenia , maintain stable regimen antipsychotic medication least two week prior enrollment ( see Table 1 Selection Criteria ) . Assessments neuropsychological performance make prior start galantamine therapy study endpoint . Upon enrollment , neuropsychological test administer study neuropsychologist , train supervised assessment technician ; fix order , accord standardized testing procedure . The following test administer : ( 1 ) Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ) ( cover ( ) verbal visual episodic memory , ( b ) verbal response generation self-monitoring , ( c ) auditory attention work memory , ( ) sustain attention psychomotor speed ) ; ( 2 ) Grooved Pegboard Test ( motor speed ) . RBANS administration counterbalance ( use Forms A B ) across subject assessment point prevent order effect . Remaining assessment administer baseline , galantamine titration , week 4 8 galantamine treatment . Psychiatric symptoms behavior assess use Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) , Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) ; Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) ; Clinical Global Impression Scale ( CGI ) ; Apathy Evaluation Scale ( AES ) . Trained research nurse , psychologist psychiatrist , administer symptom , behavior functional scale establish inter-rater reliability . In study , adverse effect monitor self-reporting observation . Vital sign collect weekly basis . Additionally , motor movement side effect rat trained research nurse , use Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale ( EPRS ) , Barnes Akathisia Scale ( BAS ) ; Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale ( AIMS ) . Following initial neuropsychological assessment patient enter ¿three week galantamine titration phase¿ galantamine add stable regimen antipsychotic medication accord follow titration schedule : 8 mg/day first week , follow 16 mg/day second 24 mg/day third week ( Raskin et al. , 2000 ) . At end titration phase , patient receive maximal allowable dose galantamine ( i.e. , 24 mg/day ) optimal dose ( i.e. , high tolerable dose devoid significant side effect [ e.g. , 16 mg/day ] ) . Moreover , end titration phase , patient administer standard battery rating instrument prior enter 8-week period active treatment maximal optimal adjuvant therapeutic dose galantamine . During active treatment phase , standard battery rating instrument administered end fourth eighth week active treatment . Patients admit 364A Unit Perry Point chart review see meet inclusion criterion study . After approval principal investigator patient approach designated member research team interest participate study .</detailed_description>
