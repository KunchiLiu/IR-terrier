	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Evidence emerge patient cure cisplatin-bleomycin chemotherapy disseminate testicular cancer ( TC ) develop large number cardiovascular risk factor ( CRF ) several year later . Recently , observe increase incidence cardiac event 10-20 year chemotherapy , possibly result increase occurrence CRF . Additional cardiovascular damage observe treatment : disturb diastolic function leave ventricle , microalbuminuria increase endothelial damage parameter . Furthermore , metabolic syndrome ( syndrome X ) insulin-resistance , dyslipidemia , hypertension endothelial damage find one third cure patient . The investigator hypothesize endothelial damage metabolic change cause bleomycin cisplatin chemotherapy main cause observe increase cardiovascular disease young cancer survivor . Genetic susceptibility may important determinant individual risk toxicity individual patient . PURPOSE : 1 . To identify risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) follow testicular cancer . 2 . To obtain insight pathway ( ) CVD development , examine whether clinical CVD follow testicular cancer associate precede unfavorable cardiovascular risk factor profile and/or treatment-related factor . 3 . To investigate genetic polymorphism pathogenetically important pathway potentially involved development treatment related cardiovascular morbidity follow testicular cancer . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Patients non-seminomatous testicular cancer uniformly treat orchidectomy cisplatin-bleomycin combination chemotherapy University Hospital Groningen , The Netherlands , since 1977 2000 eligible . 380 patient non-seminomatous testicular cancer fulfill criterion . A close routine follow-up patient treatment do University Hospital Groningen . Clinical characteristic patient , treatment detail include outcome long-term follow-up register systematically . From patient agree participate assessment cardiovascular risk factor presence subclinical cardiovascular damage perform mean several measurement technique . Also genomic DNA collect study polymorphisms pathogenetically important pathway . For total cohort patient several different late effect phenotypes cardiovascular damage cardiovascular risk factor pattern derive available data . These toxicity phenotype use select case control total cohort test candidate genetic polymorphism association occurrence toxicity . The association different genetic polymorphism toxicity phenotype estimate compare case different toxicity phenotype control without phenotype . POSSIBLE RESULTS This research provide insight pathogenesis cardiovascular disease treatment testicular cancer . The main outcome possibility select individually patient likely increase risk encounter specific cardiovascular toxicity chemotherapy treatment TC . This provide opportunities tailor potential toxic treatment and/or guide primary secondary prevention strategy serious side effect chemotherapy treatment .</brief_summary>
