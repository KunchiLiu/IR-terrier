	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make person 's white blood cell tumor cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving vaccine therapy surgery may effective treatment malignant glioma . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose vaccine therapy treat young patient undergo surgery malignant glioma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine dose-limiting toxicity adjuvant vaccination autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell surgical resection pediatric patient malignant glioma . - Determine maximum tolerate dose vaccine patient . Secondary - Determine , preliminarily , survival patient treat vaccine . - Determine , preliminarily , time tumor progression patient treat vaccine . - Determine cellular immune response patient treat vaccine . - Determine age-dependent difference response vaccine , term immunocompetence , patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients undergo surgical resection obtain tumor tissue production tumor lysate . Patients undergo leukapheresis obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) generation dendritic cell ( DC ) . DC pulse tumor lysate produce autologous dendritic cell vaccine . Approximately 10-30 day leukapheresis , patient receive vaccination autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell intradermally day 0 , 14 , 28 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos vaccine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week every 2 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-18 patient accrue study within 2-4.5 year .</detailed_description>
