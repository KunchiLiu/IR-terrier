	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ditosylate Treating Patients With Unresectable Liver Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion group patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free survival 6 month . II . To evaluate toxicity profile treatment group patient . III . To evaluate median overall survival , 6 12 month survival rate . IV . To assess target-epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) /EGFR-P protein expression gene regulate cell cycle apoptosis , either downstream cross-talk EGFR signal pathway , explore association clinical outcome . V. To measure expression profile mutation gene critical EGFR ( v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 ( ERBB2 signal pathway particular relevance GW572016 , explore new gene-drug relationship relate hepatocellular biliary carcinoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 70 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
