	<brief_title>Can Physical Activity Skill Development Parent-Centered Dietary Intervention Help Combat Child Obesity ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIMS The aim randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate compare overweight child effectiveness follow intervention : 1. parent-centered dietary modification program ; 2. physical activity skill development program ; 3. parent-centered dietary modification + physical activity skill development program . BACKGROUND We successfully pilot two community-based conventional weight management program , SHARK ( physical activity-based program ) PRAISE ( dietary modification program ) , suitable use overweight , pre-adolescent child , propose combination two program multi-component intervention potential effectively treat child obesity . We hypothesize 6- , 12- , 24-month follow-up , compare overweight child allocate physical activity dietary modification group , overweight child physical activity + dietary modification group display great reduction adiposity display improve metabolic profile . Secondary analysis determine combine intervention improve physical activity , sedentariness , energy intake , movement skill , self-esteem , activity daily live . RESEARCH PLAN Study design : An assessor-blinded randomized control trial . Participants recruitment : 216 overweight child Wollongong Newcastle age 6-9 year recruit . Each site recruit 108 participant , 36 treatment arm . Recruitment occur Media Units university , local GPs ( general practitioner ) pediatrician . Inclusion criterion : BMI ( Body Mass Index ) international cut-off point age gender , one parent able attend require session , pre-pubertal , sibling enrol . Exclusion criterion : Extreme obesity ( BMI SD [ mean ] score &gt; 3.5 ) , know syndromal cause obesity , long term oral steroid , medication associate weight gain , chronic illness , dietary restriction . Allocation group : Computer-based random number-producing algorithm schedule . Interventions : SHARK Physical activity skill development program . The “ SHARK ” program focus increase child 's actual competence ( fundamental movement skill ) , perceive competence , social support physical activity . PRAISE parent-centered family weight management program . The PRAISE Program non-diet approach healthy eat aims decrease overly restrictive eating encourage eat response “ true hunger ” . Assessment outcome variable : assess baseline , 6- , 12- , 24-month follow-up . Adiposity : BMI SD score , height , weight , waist circumference . Metabolic profile measure : blood pressure ; cholesterol , triglyceride ; glucose insulin . Physical activity energy expenditure sedentary activity : total kilocalorie expend time spend sedentary activity . Dietary energy intake : 4-day weigh food record ( 2 week day week-end ) , parent selection lower fat item household grocery shopping behavior change relate healthy lifestyle . Actual perceive competence : Test Gross Motor Development Self-Perception Profile Children . Activity daily living : Sit-to-stand transfer . Statistical analysis : intention-to-treat analysis use 12-month follow-up initial endpoint 24-month follow-up final data point . Quality-assurance . Site bias , standardize clearly define protocols retention strategy fully address .</detailed_description>
