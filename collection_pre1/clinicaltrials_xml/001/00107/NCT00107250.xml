	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : AZD2171 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , carboplatin , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving AZD2171 together chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose AZD2171 give together chemotherapy treat patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( close enrollment 8/9/07 ) , colorectal cancer , cancer suitable capecitabine treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AZD2171 Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer , Colorectal Cancer , Other Cancer Suitable Treatment With Capecitabine ( Non-Small Lung Cancer Patients Closed Enrollment 8/9/07 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose recommend phase II dose AZD2171 administer combination standard chemotherapy comprise either paclitaxel carboplatin OR capecitabine patient advance incurable non-small cell lung cancer ( close accrual 8/9/07 ) , colorectal cancer , tumor type suitable treatment capecitabine . - Determine safety tolerability regimens patient . - Determine toxicity profile dose-limiting toxic effect regimens patient . - Determine pharmacokinetic profile regimens patient . - Correlate toxicity profile pharmacokinetic profile regimens patient . - Determine antitumor activity regimens patient measurable disease . - Correlate patient outcome ( response ) baseline ( use tumor sample ) serial ( use urine plasma sample ) biomarkers patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study AZD2171 . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group accord diagnosis . - Group 1 ( non-small cell lung cancer ) ( close accrual 8/9/07 ) : Patients receive paclitaxel IV carboplatin IV day 1 . Patients also receive oral AZD2171 daily day 2-21 course 1 day 1-21 subsequent course . Treatment paclitaxel carboplatin repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Treatment AZD2171 repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Group 2 ( colorectal tumor type ) : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Patients also receive oral AZD2171 daily day 8-21 course 1 day 1-21 subsequent course . Treatment capecitabine repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Treatment AZD2171 repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In group , patient achieve complete response ( CR ) OR stable partial response ( SPR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR SPR . Cohorts 3-6 patient per group receive escalate dos AZD2171 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Up 30 additional patient ( 20 group 1 10 group 2 ) treat MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month disease relapse . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
