	<brief_title>Safety Recombinant HIV Vaccines HIV Infected Young Adults Stable Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By help control viral replication , HAART dramatically improve prognosis HIV infected individual . However , extensive side effect , may acute life-threatening , many patient find difficult tolerate HAART regimen . HAART-associated long-term morbidity mortality contribute difficulty . Administering HIV therapeutic vaccine might allow HIV infected individual delay interrupt treatment , avoid side effect associate antiretroviral exposure . This study evaluate safety two injection two recombinant therapeutic vaccine HIV infect young adult currently stable HAART . This study last 72 week . All participant receive two rMVA vaccine ( env/gag tat/rev/nef-RT ) study entry Week 4 two rFPV vaccine ( env/gag tat/rev/nef-RT ) Weeks 8 24 . Safety assess immediately immunization 1 hour 48 hour postimmunization . There 16 study visit 72 week . A physical exam , blood collection , administration adherence module occur visit . An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) occur study entry Weeks 2 10 . Urine collection occur study entry Weeks 4 , 8 , 24 .</detailed_description>
