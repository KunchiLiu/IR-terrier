	<brief_title>Study REN-1654 Patients With Sciatica Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study determine efficacy tolerability REN-1654 subject sciatica . After screen baseline clinical assessment , subject randomly assign receive REN 1654 100 mg match placebo , daily 3 week . Leg pain , back pain efficacy measure assess 1 3 week initiation treatment . A subset patient undergo analysis blood level REN-1654 course study ( pharmacokinetics ) . Subjects discontinue treatment 3 week return 3 week therapy final clinical assessment 6 week initiation treatment . If subject return follow-up , effort make telephone document clinical status whether intervention make .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female , age 18 55 , able willing provide write informed consent participate study . Able read , understand follow study instruction , include completion pain intensity rating scale . Leg pain radiate knee dermatomal pattern , diagnose due sciatica lumbar lumbosacral radiculopathy , onset occur 2 12 week prior initiation study treatment . Leg pain severity screen Categorical Pain Intensity Rating ( prior 24 hour period ) least 4 , use 11point categorical pain intensity scale 0 = pain 10 = worst pain imaginable . Leg pain screen Categorical Pain Intensity Rating rat severe back pain . Positive straight leg raise ( SLR ) test define Appendix B protocol . Subjects compliant maintain Pain Diary screen baseline visit , record 24hour average Categorical Pain Intensity Rating score least 4 great least 3 day week prior baseline visit . Subject maintain stable pharmacologic treatment sciatica symptom take prior dose include analgesic , antiinflammatory medication ( e.g . NSAIDS ) , antidepressant , anticonvulsant , anxiolytic , muscle relaxant . Subjects must stable dos medication 2 week prior baseline visit , maintain dos throughout study . Medications take asneeded basis permit , subject ask record daily usage medication subject diary . Subjects screen receive adjunctive analgesic therapy acupuncture biofeedback either discontinue establish schedule treatment remain consistent 2 week prior baseline visit , throughout study . Subject screen laboratory value within normal limit , abnormal must consider clinically significant opinion Investigator place subject risk . If female , must postmenopausal , surgically sterile , currently pregnant ( verified screening pregnancy test ) nursing , use reliable contraception method intrauterine device ( IUD ) , hormonal birth control pill , double barrier method ( male condom , female condom diaphragm spermicidal jelly ) . If male , must agree use doublebarrier method contraception . History peripheral neuropathy pain condition pain intensity equal great pain associate sciatica . Motor loss muscle correspond affect dermatome grade “ trace ” . History cauda equina syndrome , symptomatic scoliosis , spondylolisthesis ( degenerative isthmic ) , ankylose spondylitis , rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory arthropathy . Degenerative arthritis allow . History hepatic , cardiovascular , renal , gastrointestinal , hematological , neurological , endocrine ( include diabetes ) , metabolic , pulmonary , immunological ( include HIV infection ) psychiatric disease opinion Investigator would pose significant safety risk subject expose investigational compound REN1654 . History follow ophthalmic disorder base upon general medical review screen visit . Subjects undergo screen ophthalmologic assessment . Should follow identify screen ophthalmologic examination , subject exclude study . Symptomatic cataract , result visual impairment ( subject diagnose cataract degree cataract interferes daily live and/or regard ophthalmologist recommend cataract surgery ) ; Other visionimpairing disorder ( subject aware eye disorder impaired vision , agerelated macular degeneration , lazy eye ( amblyopia ) , double vision , optic nerve inflammation ; presbyopia nonpathological visual acuity deficit exclusionary ) ; Glaucoma history ocular hypertension ( intraocular pressure great 21 mmHg ) . Cognitive psychiatric disorder may diminish compliance study procedure , include maintenance daily pain diary accurate dosing study medication . Subjects , time enrollment , request advised physician receive local , regional , spinal ( articular , epidural , intrathecal nerve root block ) injection medication pain treatment surgical intervention sciatica symptom . Although subject report workrelated injury allow enroll , subject exclude involve litigation relate current episode sciatica . Subjects screen creatinine laboratory value ≥ 2.0 mg/dL . Screening liver enzyme result great upper limit normal range Use chemotherapy agent history cancer , basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma , within five year prior screen visit . History drug alcohol abuse within one year prior screen . Use within 2 week start study investigational compound dose baseline end study investigational compound , epidural , intrathecal , nerve root block agent , corticosteroid , etanercept antiTNFα agent , topical anesthetic , topical analgesic .
