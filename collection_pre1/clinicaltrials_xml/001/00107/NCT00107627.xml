	<brief_title>Skin Incision Study - Closure Skin Incisions Gynecological Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Surgical Skin Incisions ( SSI ) investigator initiate , randomize , prospective ( pilot ) study compare method skin closure follow gynecological cancer surgery evaluate : - cosmesis ; - pain ; - adverse event . The two common method skin incision closure staple subcuticular suture . Adverse event surgical incision represent major significant burden patient health care system ; however , data available compare method skin closure . Surgeons traditionally use personal belief rather data evidence choose method skin incision closure . This study evaluate three type skin closure method : - Skin staple ; - Monocryl subcuticular suture ; - Caprosyn subcuticular suture . The objective trial evaluate efficacy suture staple 6 week 3 month follow operation measure cosmesis pain . These assessed patient surgeon independently use linear analogue scale collect information analgesic medication take patient . The safety staple suture express incidence adverse event follow surgery . Post-operative event wound infection , wound complication , grade inflammation , hemorrhage complication grade accord Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC version 3 ) record . Investigators invite public patient proven suspect gynecological cancer Royal Brisbane Women 's Hospital Mater Hospital ( RBWH ) book elective surgery meet selection criterion participate study . This pilot study generate data definitive randomize study . Ninety ( 90 ) patient require recruitment pilot study . The type closure method patient receive allocate use randomization process . Three equally size study arm 30 patient surgical incision close either surgical staple , Monocryl Caprosyn . Additionally , patient stratify site remove selection bias . All test assessment operation standard care . These result record . No additional test assessment perform aim trial . Randomization , data management statistical analysis coordinate Queensland Centre Gynaecological Cancer . Statistical analysis include calculate mean value standard deviation score group assessment . Chi-square test use compare difference proportion patient experience adverse event time point . Results trial present scientific meeting national international level educational meeting medical staff . The result trial also submit publishing . The study generate data definitive randomize study .</detailed_description>
