	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate residual allergenicity Tree MATA ( modify pollen allergen tyrosine adsorbate ) skin prick testing . This do comparison wheal response skin prick test aqueous native modify allergen , modify tyrosine adsorb allergen Tree MATA MPL ( modify tyrosine adsorb + MPL [ Monophosphoryl Lipid A ] ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Residual Allergenicity Tree ( Birch , Hazel , Alder ) Pollen Allergoid Using Skin Prick Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tree MATA MPL develop provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy patient prove type I hypersensitivity cross react tree pollen . MPL ( Monophosphoryl Lipid A ) , purify , detoxify glycolipid derive cell wall Salmonella minnesota , include product formulation adjuvant increase immunogenic effect product enhance switch allergen-specific TH2 TH1-like profile . The tree pollen extract modify glutaraldehyde produce active ingredient , allergoid . This modification reduce reactivity extract IgE antibody , thus reduce risk side effect . However , simultaneous reduction important immunological property , IgG T cell reactivity see . The purpose study assess residual allergenicity modify tree pollen Tree MATA MPL use skin prick testing .</detailed_description>
