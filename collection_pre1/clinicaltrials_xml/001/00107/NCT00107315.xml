	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth colorectal cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together capecitabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together capecitabine work first-line therapy treat old patient metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Capecitabine First-Line Therapy Treating Older Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine time disease progression old patient metastatic colorectal cancer treat bevacizumab capecitabine first-line therapy . Secondary - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine median survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-7 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study within 13-16 month .</detailed_description>
