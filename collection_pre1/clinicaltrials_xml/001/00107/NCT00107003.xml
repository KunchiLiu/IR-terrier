	<brief_summary>This study examine whether experimental drug call GW572016 delay tumor growth patient glioblastoma multiforme ( GMB , malignant brain tumor ) . GW572016 believe affect cancer cell function interfere internal signaling need cancer grow . The study also determine whether presence specific proteins tumor predict effect GW572016 tumor . Patients 18 year age old GMB whose brain tumor respond standard medical treatment undergo surgery tumor may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination neurocognitive examination , blood test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , echocardiogram ( ultrasound test heart function ) MUGA scan ( nuclear medicine test heart function ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) head , compute tomography ( CT ) head . CT use x-ray MRI use magnetic field radio wave show brain structure . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - MRI blood test surgery . - Surgery remove brain tumor . - Follow-up MRIs every 8 week surgery . - Follow-up echocardiogram MUGA scan every 8 week surgery . - GW572016 treatment start 7-10 day surgery continue patient doctor decide patient 's best interest stop tumor worsens . ( The drug stop temporarily surgery heal period surgery . ) - Blood test every 2 week evaluate effect GW572016 body . - Blood test first GW572016 treatment time surgery assess effect drug cell determine much drug present blood time surgery . Participants follow clinic least monthly take GW572016 . While treatment keep diary document daily treatment . The diary collect monthly follow-up exam . After treatment end , patient contact periodically research staff rest live follow long-term effect study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GW572016 Treat Recurrent Malignant Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - One critical challenge face glioblastoma translational research develop way predict , base patient 's biopsy , target inhibitor likely provide benefit . The study outline proposal design determine glioblastoma patient likely benefit GW572106 , may provide blueprint analyze promise new pathway inhibitor future . We anticipate study serve basis biological endpoint base trial future . Thus , overall goal evaluate efficacy GW572016 treatment recurrent malignant glioma patient candidate re-resection . Objective : - Determine 6-month progression-free survival rate patient recurrent progressive glioblastoma treat GW572016 . - Determine whether GW572016 inhibit phosphorylation cellular target EGFR HER2 , downstream PI3K-AKT RAS-ERK signal pathway glioblastoma patient vivo . - Determine tumor concentration GW572016 . - Assess overall progression free survival safety . Eligibility : - Patients histologically prove intracranial tumor include glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) Gliosarcoma ( GS ) . Patients eligible original histology low-grade glioma subsequent histological diagnosis GBM make . - Patients must candidate surgical re-resection ( total , sub-total ) order eligible study . Following surgery , scan do later 96 hour - Patients may non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug ( Non-EIAED 's ) . They may EIAED 's . If previously EIAED , patient must two week prior initiation pre-operative drug . Design : - A Pre-Treatment blood sample ( 10ml ) obtain patient genotyping - Pre- Operative : GW572016 administer start dose 750 mg orally BID daily outpatient basis 7-10 day . ( This range allow flexibility planning surgery ) . GW572016 continue include even surgery . - At time surgery 10ml blood collect EDTA contain tubes pharmacodynamic analysis - Treatment may institute postoperatively soon patient recover effect surgery demonstrate wound heal . Treatment GW572016 post-operatively start later 28 day surgery . GW572016 administer start dose 750 mg orally BID daily outpatient basis . GW572016 administer continuously ; however , purpose protocol evaluation , cycle define 28 day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA ( General ) : Patients histologically prove intracranial tumor include glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) Gliosarcoma ( GS ) . Patients eligible original histology lowgrade glioma subsequent histological diagnosis GBM make . Unstained slide ( least 5 , prefer 10 ) 1 tissue block must available least one prior surgery . If available , frozen tissue also request early surgery . Patients must candidate surgical reresection ( total , subtotal ) order eligible study . Following surgery , scan do later 96 hour . Patients may nonenzymeinducing antiepileptic drug ( NonEIAED 's ) . They may EIAED 's . If previously EIAED , patient must two week prior initiation preoperative drug . Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram MUGA scan ( within 42 day registration ) . All patient must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must sign authorization release protect health information . Patients must register NABTC database prior treatment study drug . Patients must great equal 18 year old , life expectancy great 8 week . Patients must Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy least 28 day investigational agent , 28 day prior cytotoxic therapy , 28 day radiation , 14 day vincristine , 42 day nitrosoureas , 21 day procarbazine administration , 7 day noncytotoxic agent , e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc . ( radiosensitizer count ) . Any question relate definition noncytotoxic agent direct Study Chair . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( WBC great equal 3,000/microl , ANC great equal 1,500/mm ( 3 ) , platelet count great equal 100,000/mm ( 3 ) , hemoglobin great equal 10 gm/dl ) , adequate liver function ( SGOT bilirubin less 2.5 time ULN ) , adequate renal function ( creatinine le 1.5 mg/dL start therapy . These test must perform within 14 day prior registration . Eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion . Patients must show unequivocal evidence tumor progression MRI CT scan . Stable dose steroid mandate study . The type scan , i.e. , MRI CT must use throughout period protocol treatment tumor measurement . Patients must fail prior radiation therapy . Patients prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation true progressive disease rather radiation necrosis base upon either PET Thallium scanning , MR spectroscopy surgical documentation disease . Patients may treatment 2 prior relapse . Relapse define progression follow initial therapy ( i.e . radiation+/ chemo [ include gliadel wafer ] use initial therapy ) . The intent therefore patient 3 prior therapy ( initial treatment 2 relapse ) . If patient surgical resection relapse disease anticancer therapy institute 12 week , patient undergoes another surgical resection , consider 1 relapse . For patient prior therapy lowgrade glioma , surgical diagnosis highgrade glioma consider first relapse . Eligibility restart drug postop . Patients must agree practice adequate contraception . Women childbearing potential must negative BHCG pregnancy test document within 7 day prior registration . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( General ) : Patients may medication list section 3.2.1 Patients must significant medical illness investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year ineligible . Patients must active infection serious intercurrent medical illness . Women childbearing potential must pregnant/breast feeding . Patients must pregnant study drug perform evaluate safety . HIVPositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study due possible retroviral drug interaction . Patients must disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism . Patients must receive prior therapy Signal transduction inhibitor ( e.g . ZD1839 , OSI774 , R115777 )</criteria>
