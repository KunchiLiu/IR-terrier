	<brief_summary>This study do test drug call etanercept ( Enbrel® ) . Etanercept approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment chronic moderate severe plaque psoriasis ( PsO ) , use reduce sign symptom moderately severely active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) adult child , psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) adult . It available prescription treatment PsO , RA , PsA , AS . Etanercept approve injection skin dose 50 mg per week patient psoriasis . The purpose study determine whether etanercept safe effective treatment hidradenitis . Another purpose study determine impact etanercept treatment hidradenitis skin relate quality life . The skin lesion typically associate hidradenitis think partly due blockage occur sweat gland , call apocrine duct , become inflame eventually destroy . A protein find body call tumor necrosis factor alpha , TNF- α , hormone cause inflammation swell . The study drug , etanercept , block action TNF- α . By block action TNF-α , etanercept may provide reduction sign symptom hidradenitis . This study take place University Pennsylvania involve 21 participant age 18 . Approximately 21 subject participate University Pennsylvania . Each patient participate study maximum 6 month . The study consist screen visit , baseline assessment visit ( Day 1 ) , treatment period ( Week 2 - Week 14 ) , one month follow-up visit ( Week 18 visit ) . The total duration study approximately 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : The primary objective study determine safety estimate efficacy etanercept treatment hidradenitis suppurativa . The secondary objective study determine impact etanercept treatment hidradenitis suppurativa skin relate quality life . Duration : Each patient participate study maximum 6 month . The study consist screen visit , baseline assessment visit ( Day 1 ) , treatment period ( Week 2 - Week 14 ) , one month follow-up visit ( Week 18 visit ) . The total duration study approximately 2 year . Subject Recruitment Selection : It plan enrollment 12-21 patient . Background : Hidradenitis suppurativa physically , psychologically , socially disable disease characterize inflammatory , cystic papule nodule affect underarms , groin , perineum , breast . Lesions become erosive often develop deep abscess sinus tract drain foul smell pu . Left untreated , hidradenitis result permanent scarring . In severe case , characterize chronic ulceration granulation , may increase risk aggressive squamous cell carcinoma . Current treatment hidradenitis consist intra-lesional injection steroid , topical and/or systemic antibiotic , hormonal therapy , isotretinoin . For many patient severe hidradenitis ( stage II III ) , therapy often ineffective . Patients stage II III hidradenitis often require surgical excision affect area ( highly morbid procedure ) control disease . Unfortunately , patient hidradenitis , exist therapy ineffective unmet medical need therapy control disable destructive disease . The pathophysiology hidradenitis unknown . The lead hypothesis occlusion apocrine ducts lead severe dilatation , apocrine gland inflammation , ensue bacterial growth neutrophilic infiltration destruction duct . The importance immune dysregulation hidradenitis demonstrate association many individual inflammatory bowel disease . The pathologic immune reaction follicular occlusion hidradenitis suggest strong rationale use treatment may neutralize inflammatory reaction . In fact , exist standard treatment hidradenitis intra-lesional injection steroid , effort minimize destructive nature immune response . Medications broadly immuno-suppressive , cyclosporine , also use successfully treat hidradenitis , limited organ toxicity . This rationale support case report dramatic rapid ( e.g . within day ) improvement hidradenitis treat infliximab , monoclonal antibody block TNF-alpha . Etanercept TNF-alpha inhibitor currently FDA approve treat various inflammatory disorder include rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis psoriasis . By inhibit TNF-alpha , etanercept stops inflammatory cascade bind directly circulate TNF-alpha inhibit bind cell surface receptor . Etanercept use 200,000 patient world wide 5 year well establish safety record . The common adverse effect etanercept injection site reaction typically mild self-limited . Currently , laboratory monitoring patient treat etanercept recommended accord label since drug associate significant incidence laboratory abnormality . The well establish safety profile etanercept potent role suppress pathologic immune response TNF-inhibition make promising agent treatment hidradenitis suppurativa . In phase II clinical trial , determine preliminary evidence safety estimate efficacy etanercept treatment hidradenitis . This study provide critical preliminary data planning large pivotal trial . Research Design : This phase II , open label , two-stage clinical trial etanercept treatment hidradenitis . This design widely accept method early investigation safety efficacy medication new indication . Etanercept 50 mg administer subcutaneously week 12 week open label manner . At week 12 , etanercept dose tapered 25 mg subcutaneously week 2 week . This 18 week study . Subjects screen determine eligibility . Day -95 -3 screen period allow washout concurrent therapy necessary . Potential Risks : Etanercept generally well tolerated patient rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , ankylose spondylitis . Adverse event report least 3 % patient high incidence patient treat etanercept placebo : - Injection site reaction ; - Infection ; - Headache ; - Nausea ; - Rhinitis ; - Dizziness ; - Pharyngitis ; - Cough ; - Asthenia ; - Abdominal pain ; - Rash ; - Peripheral edema ; - Respiratory disorder ; - Dyspepsia ; - Sinusitis ; - Vomiting ; - Mouth ulcer ; - Alopecia Potential Benefits : No direct benefit participation study guarantee . The study medication provide Financial Sponsor charge .</detailed_description>
