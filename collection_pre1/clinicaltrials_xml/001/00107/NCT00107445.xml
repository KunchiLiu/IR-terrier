	<brief_title>EF5 Finding Oxygen Tumor Cells Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery Biopsy Cervical , Endometrial , Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Correlate level EF5 bind pre-treatment hemoglobin level tumor grade stage patient undergoing surgery biopsy cervical , endometrial , ovarian epithelial cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Correlate pre-treatment tumor hypoxia ( measure EF5 bind ) time progression time recurrence patient . II . Correlate EF5 bind CD-31 expression ( tumor vasculature ) , Ki-67 expression ( cellular proliferation ) , erythropoietin signal patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive EF5 IV 1-2½ hour day 1 . Approximately 1-2 day later , patient undergo tumor resection biopsy . Patients ' tumor tissue sample undergo immunohistochemistry flow cytometry detect EF5 binding level . Patients ' blood drawn immediately 30-60 minute 1-2 day receive EF5 measure systemic EF5 binding level . Patients follow 30-45 day administration EF5 every 3-6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
