	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make person 's white blood cell donor 's tumor cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well vaccine therapy work treat patient unresected stage III stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Unresected Stage III Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine clinical activity vaccine therapy comprise autologous dendritic cell pulse allogeneic melanoma tumor cell lysates ( IDD-3 ) , measure tumor control , patient unresected stage IIIB IIIC stage IV melanoma . Secondary - Determine immunologic activity vaccine , measure T-cell antibody response lysate melanoma antigen peptide , patient . - Determine safety vaccine , measure incidence severity adverse event , patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients undergo apheresis collect peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . The PBMCs culture sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) interleukin-13 production dendritic cell . The dendritic cell pulse lysates 3 allogeneic melanoma tumor cell line ( IDD-3 ) produce vaccine . Patients receive vaccine therapy comprise IDD-3 administer 1 subcutaneous 5 intradermal injection 2 uninvolved lymph node-bearing region week 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 16 , 22 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 , 10 , 18 , 26 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-37 patient accrue study within 4-12 month .</detailed_description>
