	<brief_title>Effectiveness Two Hepatitis B Vaccines HIV-negative Youths</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B ( HBV ) prophylactic immunization recommend at-risk adolescent 10 year although universal coverage achieve . Vaccine response healthy adolescent generally report excellent . But , data study Reaching Excellence Adolescent Care Health ( REACH ) study HIV-negative adolescent at-risk acquire Hepatitis B infection sexual needle share behavior demonstrate much low expect vaccine response rate population use standard vaccine dosing . Some data suggest factor gender body mass index might responsible difference response vaccine observe individual . The reason diminish vaccine response population unclear . If fact , Hepatitis B vaccine response diminish population , effort determine correlate response improve response warrant . The propose trial evaluate 2 license vaccine product give two-dose schedule youth risk hepatitis B HIV infection evaluate immunogenicity product population , barrier vaccine delivery , factor predict diminish immune response . Since youth also potential candidate future HIV vaccine trial , participation trial require ability understand willingness volunteer trial , ability return multiple vaccination blood draw assess vaccine response , willingness participate HIV prevention education . A hepatitis B vaccine trial provide license vaccine youth vaccine indicate allow preliminary assessment youth 's willingness participate vaccine trial involve blood draw immunologic assessment . Tools necessary HIV vaccine trial youth include youth-friendly simplified vaccine trial education component require write test participant , standardize risk reduction education program , computer-assisted assessment youth behavior . These tool finalize field test youth participate hepatitis B vaccine trial without promote false sense protection HIV . Secondary objective trial include assessment number ancillary tool crucial future HIV vaccine trial . This Hepatitis B vaccine trial also serve HIV vaccine preparedness trial youth risk Hepatitis B HIV . Design : This phase II , randomize , single-blinded trial two hepatitis B immunization regimens 150 HIV-negative , hepatitis B core antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen surface antibody negative youth . Vaccinations give two-dose regimen 0 six month ( 75 subject arm ) primary outcome seroresponsiveness one month 6-month dose . Safety tolerability also assess .</detailed_description>
