	<brief_title>A Study Anal Cancer Development HIV Infected People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) common viral infection among men woman . Individuals HPV risk anal dysplasia , condition may lead anal cancer . It observe HIV progress rapidly individual coinfected HPV HIV , compare people either disease alone . Studies investigated effect highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) progression anal dysplasia contradictory inconclusive . The role CD4 count HIV suppression contribution progression anal disease need determine . This trial substudy study management antiretroviral therapy ( SMART ) . In SMART study , patient participate one two strategy : drug conservation ( DC ) strategy viral suppression ( VS ) strategy . Participants DC group stop defer HAART , receive episodic HAART treatment minimum time need maintain CD4 cell count least 250 cells/mm3 . Participants VS group receive HAART maintain viral load low possible , regardless CD4 count . This study compare time development high-grade anal dysplasia anal cancer participant currently enrol SMART study . Patients participate substudy main SMART study time . At baseline visit , participant undergo anal swab ; female participant cervical swab well . Participants provide detailed sexual history include sexually transmit infection , history anal-related condition , history alcohol recreational drug use . These procedure repeat annual follow-up visit . Some participant may undergo additional anal cytology high-resolution anoscopy biopsy . Participants follow develop high-grade anal dysplasia anal cancer SMART study close , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
