	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one chemotherapy drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cyclophosphamide together capecitabine work treat woman stage IV breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0430 Cyclophosphamide Capecitabine Treating Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate ( complete partial , confirm unconfirmed ) woman stage IV breast cancer treat oral cyclophosphamide oral capecitabine . - Determine progression-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide daily day 1-14 oral capecitabine twice daily day 8-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline week 7 , 13 , 19 , 25 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 96 patient accrue study within 4 year .</detailed_description>
