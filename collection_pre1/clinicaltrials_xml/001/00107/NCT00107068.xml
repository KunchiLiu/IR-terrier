	<brief_summary>This study investigate efficacy aerobic exercise progressive resistance training ( PRT ) , singularly combine , change walk endurance mildly-to-moderately affect chronic stroke patient . Specifically , determine relative importance training induced change muscle strength versus aerobic fitness increase gait velocity 6-min walking distance , ass concomitant functional psychosocial impact increase muscle strength , aerobic fitness improve gait . This longitudinal study conduct double blind factorial randomize control trial exercise training chronic stroke patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Training Walking Ability After Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental hypothesis : 1 . Participation 10-week exercise program consist aerobic , resistance combine aerobic+resistance train produce 20 % great increase 6-min walk distance compare control . 2 . Aerobic fitness increase equally combined aerobic+resistance program aerobic program alone , great resistance program , effect measure term maximal submaximal cardiorespiratory exercise performance . 3 . Lower limb muscle strength increase equally combined aerobic+resistance program resistance program alone , great increase strength aerobic training , effect measure term measure low limb strength , power endurance . Research Plan Synopsis : To determine treatment efficacy , 2x2 factorial double-blinded randomize control trial conduct , two factor aerobic train PRT . Forty-eight subject randomly allocate one four group comprise ( ) aerobic exercise training [ AEROBIC ; n=12 ] ; ( ii ) PRT [ RESISTANCE ; n=12 ] ; ( iii ) combine aerobic training PRT [ AEROBIC+RESISTANCE ; n=12 ] , ( iv ) control [ CONTROLS ; n=12 ] . AEROBIC RESISTANCE group also include `` sham '' treatment factor , order presentation treatment versus `` sham '' also randomize within exercise session . All subject attend 3 time per week 10 week . Subjects recruit various hospital , peer support group previous participant acute stroke research project conduct . All screen medical practitioner inclusion exclusion criterion allocate one four group trial coordinator . Interventions : AEROBIC Training Group : These subject undertake 30 min leg cycle per exercise session . Leg cycling perform pedal cadence 50 rev/min seat posture use standard seat cycle ergometer elicit target heart rate equivalent 50 % VO2peak - 70 % VO2peak . Subjects group also undertake 30-min `` sham '' resistance training consist stretch calisthenics lack strength development characteristic . Cycle ergometry use develop aerobic fitness , rather fast walking , previous study show stroke patient capacity walk sufficient pace provide adequate stimulus cardiovascular system . RESISTANCE Training Group : These subject undertake 30 min PRT per exercise session use pneumatic resistance equipment free weight . Standard PRT principles govern frequency , volume , duration , intensity exercise know provide maximal adaptation healthy frail adult follow . Legs train unilaterally maximize neural recruitment impaired side prevent substitution strong muscle weak one . Subjects perform 3 set 8 repetition 80 % one repetition maximum muscle group . Subjects group also undertake 30-min `` sham '' aerobic training consist motorize passive leg cycling . AEROBIC+ RESISTANCE Training Group : Subjects AEROBIC+RESISTANCE train group undertake 30 min leg cycling exercise describe AEROBIC group addition 30 min PRT describe RESISTANCE group per exercise session . CONTROL Group : Subjects group undertake 30-min `` sham '' aerobic training consist motorize passive leg cycle 30-min `` sham '' resistance training consist stretch calisthenics lack strength development characteristic per session . Outcomes : Primary outcome : Subjects undertake 6 min walk test maximum distance . The 6-min test select primary outcome walk distance important criterion 'community ambulation ' , avoids problem gait velocity relevant short-distance ambulation prior history investigation previous study low intensity aerobic resistance training . Secondary outcome : A. Cardiorespiratory Fitness assess cardiorespiratory variable collect ( ) maximal effort cycle test , ( ii ) multi stage submaximal exercise cycle test , ( iii ) dual stage treadmill walk test , perform separate day . B . Lower limb Muscular Strength Endurance assess maximal muscle force , maximal muscle power muscle endurance use pneumatic resistance machine ( leg press , knee extension ) free weight ( hip abduction , ankle dorsiflexion ) . C. Mobility Variables : Temporal ( velocity , step time , single support , double support ) spatial ( step length stride length ) variable collect use gait analysis system . Balance stand coordinate stability assess use sway-meter measure displacement body level waist . D. Scales Questionnaires : To provide assessment change subject ' psychological functional state , stroke impact scale , self-efficacy scale health-related quality life questionnaire use . Data Analysis : Treatment efficacy primary secondary outcome analyze use univariate multivariate analysis variance . Where within-group difference find , appropriate multiple comparison posteriori analysis use . If significant multivariate effect evident , standardized discriminant function coefficient examine give indication relative importance variable explain variance group time effect . To allow possibility data may covariates upon primary outcome , multiple regression analysis utilize explore relative importance aerobic fitness , muscle power , strength endurance mobility measure upon 6-min walk distance .</detailed_description>
