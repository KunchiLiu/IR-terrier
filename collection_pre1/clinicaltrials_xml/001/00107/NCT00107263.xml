	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use letrozole may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Zoledronate may prevent bone loss patient receive letrozole . It yet know schedule zoledronate effective prevent bone loss patient breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study two different schedule zoledronate compare well work prevent bone loss postmenopausal woman receive letrozole stage I , stage II , stage IIIA breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronate Preventing Bone Loss Postmenopausal Women Who Are Receiving Letrozole Stage I , Stage II , Stage IIIA Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare effectiveness zoledronate v standard care reduce bone loss first 12 month study treatment postmenopausal woman stage I-IIIA breast cancer initiate letrozole prior treatment tamoxifen . - Compare effect immediate v delay zoledronate , annually 2-5 year post-baseline , reduce bone loss patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord duration prior tamoxifen therapy ( ≤ 2 year vs &gt; 2 year ) ; time since tamoxifen therapy discontinue ( &lt; 1 v ≥ 1 year ) ; prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( yes v ) ; baseline total lumbar spine femoral neck bone mineral density ( BMD ) T-score ( &gt; -1 standard deviation [ SD ] v -1 -2 SD ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( immediate therapy ) : Patients receive oral letrozole daily . Patients also receive zoledronate IV 15 minute every 6 month . - Arm II ( delay therapy ) : Patients receive oral letrozole arm I . Patients radiologic evidence bone loss 1 year letrozole therapy receive zoledronate arm I . In arm , treatment continue 5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 550 patient ( 275 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 28 month .</detailed_description>
