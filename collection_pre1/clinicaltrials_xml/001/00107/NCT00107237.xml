	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : AEE788 everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving AEE788 together everolimus may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose AEE788 give together everolimus see well work treat patient recurrent relapse glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity AEE788 administer combination 1 2 different dos everolimus patient recurrent relapse glioblastoma multiforme . Secondary - Determine safety tolerability regimen , include acute chronic toxic effect , patient . - Determine single-dose repeated-dose pharmacokinetic profile regimen patient . - Determine , preliminarily , efficacy regimen , term response rate , progression-free survival , overall survival , patient . ( Phase II ) - Determine antiangiogenic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study AEE788 . - Phase I : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . - Group 1 : Patients receive oral AEE788 daily oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . - Group 2 : Beginning first occurrence dose-limiting toxicity group 1 , patient receive AEE788 group 1 higher-dose oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . In group , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient per group receive escalate dos AEE788 maximum tolerate dose determine . - Phase II : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group accord eligibility surgery . - Group 1 ( eligible tumor biopsy , surgical resection , tumor debulking ) : Patients receive oral AEE788 daily MTD oral everolimus daily 5-9 day . Patients undergo surgery . Beginning 15-21 day surgery , patient receive oral AEE788 oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . - Group 2 ( ineligible surgery ) : Patients receive oral AEE788 daily MTD oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . In group , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In phase , treatment AEE788 everolimus stop due toxicity , patient may continue receive AEE788 everolimus alone daily . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month long investigator deem necessary .</detailed_description>
