	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) ) patient malignant mesothelioma treat BAY 43-9006 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 3-month failure free survival patient malignant mesothelioma treat BAY 43-9006 . II . To describe median overall survival malignant mesothelioma patient treat BAY 43-9006 . III . To describe toxicity profile BAY 43-9006 patient malignant mesothelioma . IV . To determine whether mesothelioma contain mutation exon 11 15 B-raf gene correlate finding anti-tumor activity BAY 43-9006 . V. To determine whether amount expression phospho-ERK1/2 , determine immunohistochemistry pre-treatment tumor specimen , correlate anti-tumor activity BAY 43-9006 patient mesothelioma . VI . To determine whether baseline level change follow BAY 43-9006 treatment angiogenic cytokine ( VEGF PDGF ) correlate anti-tumor activity BAY 43-9006 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least every 2 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
