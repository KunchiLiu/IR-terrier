	<brief_summary>Over 500,000 patient undergo cardiac surgery CPB United States annually . Although mortality rate decrease advance perioperative care , many patient affect postoperative organ dysfunction . The incidence complication may exceed 30 % . It speculate exaggerated inflammatory response surgical trauma CPB machine likely cause morbidity . Factors predispose organ dysfunction include tissue injury , endotoxemia , oxidative stress . High risk patient identify preoperatively validated Parsonnet Additive Risk Score . CTI-01 demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory tissue protection activity multiple animal model disease include pancreatitis , ischemia-reperfusion injury , sepsis , renal injury , endotoxemia . These finding support clinical use critical care medicine include cardiac surgery . Patients receive total six dos , administer intravenously prior surgery .</brief_summary>
