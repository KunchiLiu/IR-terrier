	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study well surgery and/or combination chemotherapy without radiation therapy observation work treat young patient newly diagnose stage I stage II lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin disease ( LPHD ) . Surgery may effective treatment LPHD . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill cancer cell . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) without radiation therapy may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preserve excellent cure rate patient lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin disease ( LPHD ) employ treatment strategy minimize exposure chemotherapy radiation therapy appropriate patient . II . To estimate proportion stage I patient ( single involve lymph node totally resect ) cure surgery alone . III . To estimate proportion stage I unresected , stage I resect ( whose disease recur observation ) , stage II LPHD patient cure adriamycin ( doxorubicin ) /vincristine/prednisone/cyclophosphamide ( AV-PC ) x 3 , involve field radiation therapy ( IFRT ) CR chemotherapy . IV . To reduce potential long-term toxicity LPHD treatment . OUTLINE : This pilot study . Patients stage IA disease underwent confirm complete resection single involve lymph node diagnosis undergo observation only* . Patients stage IA disease underwent possible complete resection single involve lymph node diagnosis undergo image 6-7 week surgery . Patients confirm complete resection image undergo observation only* . Patients demonstrate complete resection image proceed combination chemotherapy without radiotherapy . Patients stage IA disease underwent fine needle aspiration single involve lymph node OR incomplete resection single involve lymph node diagnosis may undergo second surgery achieve complete resection . Patients undergo complete resection second surgery undergo image 6-7 week surgery . Patients confirm complete resection image undergo observation only* . Patients undergo second surgery OR achieve complete resection second surgery proceed combination chemotherapy without radiotherapy . Patients stage IA disease involvement 1 lymph node OR stage IIA disease proceed directly combination chemotherapy without radiotherapy . NOTE : *Patients recurrent disease observation undergo biopsy restaging proceed combination chemotherapy without radiotherapy . COMBINATION CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 10-30 minute cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1 , vincristine IV 1 minute day 1 8 , prednisone orally ( PO ) IV two three time daily day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) 3 course therapy proceed follow-up . Patients achieve CR proceed involved-field radiotherapy . INVOLVED-FIELD RADIOTHERAPY ( IFRT ) : Beginning within 3 week completion combination chemotherapy , patient undergo IFRT daily , 5 day week 2.8 week ( 14 treatment ) . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year , every 5 year 10 year .</detailed_description>
