	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate side effect new treatment stomach cancer may potentially improve prognosis cancer . Our principle objective improve result standard chemotherapy radiation surgery patient gastric cancer . The intra-abdominal ( intraperitoneal ) administration floxuridine ( FUDR ) procedure study determined safe treatment . In study , want evaluate side effect treatment give surgery standard intravenous chemotherapy radiation . Study treatment start surgical removal part stomach cancer , together surround tissue lymph node . After surgery , patient get treatment chemotherapy drug , FUDR , administer directly abdomen . This call intraperitoneal chemotherapy . After treatment patient receive repeat intravenous injection two drug , 5-fluorouracil leucovorin alone combine irradiation abdomen .</brief_summary>
