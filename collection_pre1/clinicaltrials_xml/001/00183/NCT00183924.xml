	<brief_summary>This study patient prostate cancer metastatic , progressive , resistant hormonal manipulation mitoxantrone chemotherapy.Patients previously treat surgical removal testes hormone therapy , subsequently chemotherapy included drug , mitoxantrone ( Novantrone ) . Patients prostate cancer worsen despite treatment . We hope learn whether combination chemotherapy decrease cancer symptom test , determine frequently serious side effect occur acceptable toxicity chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must histological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate currently must metastatic disease ( stage TxNxM1 ) unresponsive refractory hormone therapy mitoxantronebased chemotherapeutic regimen . Patients must metastatic prostate cancer deem hormone mitoxantrone refractory one following ( despite androgen ablation , antiandrogen withdrawal mitoxantrone therapy applicable ) : 1 . Progression measurable disease assess within 28 day prior registration . 2 . Progression nonmeasurable ( i.e . bone scan PET scan ) disease assess within 42 day prior registration . 3 . Rising PSA define least 2 consecutive rise PSA document reference value ( measure 1 ) . The first rise PSA ( measure 2 ) take least 7 day reference value . A third confirmatory PSA measure require ( 2nd beyond reference level ) great second measure must obtain least 7 day 2nd measure . Patient must PSA concentration least 10 ng/ml addition increase PSA eligible base PSA criterion alone . No minimum PSA require patient measurable disease nonPSA evaluable disease . Age &gt; 18 year Must prestudy PSA ( within 28 day prior registration ) Note : The PSA result ( do within 28 day prior registration ) need elevate inclusion provide criterion progression meet . Must receive prior hormonal therapy castrate level testosterone . Patients treat orchiectomy eligible . If treat nonsteroidal antiandrogens , patient must cease take flutamide nilutamide least 28 day prior enrollment least 42 day prior enrollment bicalutamide , patient must demonstrate disease progression . Either method castration supplement nonsteroidal antiandrogen ( e.g . flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide ) . Must receive prior mitoxantrone therapy Prior radiation therapy allow must less 25 % total body bone marrow ( see Appendix 5 ) . This include prior use samarium , patient receive strontium . ( &gt; 28 day must elapse since completion RT recovery side effect . Soft tissue disease irradiate prior 2 month may designate measurable disease ) . May receive prior surgery ( 21 day must elapse since completion surgery recovery side effect ) Creatinine le equal 1.5x institutional upper limit normal ( within 28 day prior registration ) Bilirubin less equal institutional upper limit normal ( within 28 day prior registration ) . Liver enzymes : If alkaline phosphatase less equal 4 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) , AST ALT must less equal 2.0 x ULN . If alkaline phosphatase &gt; 4 x ULN patient bone metastasis , AST ALT must &lt; 1.25 x ULN . Adequate bone marrow function . Complete blood count differential must do within 14 day prior registration 1 . WBC great equal 3000 cells/mm3 2 . Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1500 cells/mm3 3 . Platelet count great equal 100,000 cells/mm3 4 . Hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dl ECOG performance status 03 . ( For patient PS 3 , cause must due pain secondary bone metastasis eligible ) Must pain ( control treatment pain ) attributable metastatic prostate cancer define PPI score great equal 1 . Subjects must stabilization analgesic medication least one week prior receive study medication . No chemotherapy , biological response modifier , RT , radioisotope therapy ( e.g . samarium strontium ) , corticosteroid ( &gt; 10mg prednisone per day equivalent ) , bisphosphonates concomitant hormonal therapy may give protocol treatment . Patients may treat bisphosphonates provide initiated prior study entry . Completed baseline QOL measure prior registration ( EORTC QLQC30 plus prostate cancer module ; McGill Pain Questionnaire ; Pain Medication Log . The nurse CRA must complete QOL Cover sheet baseline assessment prior registration . Patient must willing complete questionnaire study . If unable complete questionnaire English Spanish , patient register without contribute QOL study ) . Men childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception treatment reasonable period ( 90 day ) thereafter . Patients must available treatment followup objective response and/or residual toxicity . Willing able give inform consent sign IRB approve informed consent Myocardial infarction angina pectoris within one year registration History brain metastasis currently treat untreated brain metastasis . ( Patients neurological symptom must CT MRI brain negative metastatic disease within 56 day prior registration ) Active thrombophlebitis hypercoagulability . Known history pulmonary embolism deep venous thrombosis . Not recovered major infection and/or surgical procedure , significant active concurrent medical illness preclude protocol therapy survival . Known anticipate severe hypersensitivity reaction estramustine , docetaxel , polysorbate 80 carboplatin Other prior malignancy ( except patient another stage I II malignancy currently complete remission cancer evidence disease great 5 year accrual current trial . Patients basal squamous cell carcinoma skin treat curative intent accrue trial 30 day treatment ) . Preexistent peripheral neuropathy great equal grade 2 Prior therapy estramustine , taxanes ( e.g . paclitaxel , docetaxel ) platinumbased ( e.g . cisplatin , carboplatin , oxaliplatin ) drug ongoing therapy Ongoing therapy drug know inhibit P4503A4 drug metabolism include : Macrolide antibiotic : erythromycin , troleandomycin , azithromycin ; Calcium antagonists : nifedipine , diltiazem ; Imidazole antifungal agent : ketoconazole , itraconazole , fluconazole ; HIV protease inhibitor ; Immunosuppressive agent : cyclosporin , FK506 Ongoing therapy drug know induce P4503A4 drug metabolism include : Phenobarbital , phenytoin , carbamazepine , griseofuvin rifampin .</criteria>
