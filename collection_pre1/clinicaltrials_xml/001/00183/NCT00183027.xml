	<detailed_description>This study 3-phase investigation design test two caloric restriction ( CR ) regimens participant compliance variability metabolic physiologic effect . Initially , phase 1 ( 1 week pre-phase , 6 week phase 1 ) , participant maintain normal habit home . Then phase 2 ( 24 week ) , 44 participant randomize one two diet ( Diet HG Diet LG ) , consume either 70 % 90 % baseline energy intake . The participant randomize 90 % CR ( diet ) form control group . All food provide phase , participant require attend weekly group individual meeting behavioral counselor dietitian , perform regular self-monitoring . During phase 3 ( 24 week ) , participant prepare food home accord CR regimen eat maintain CR specify phase 2 . They continue attend weekly meeting perform self-monitoring . Diet HG : diet base USDA Food Guide Pyramid , additional emphasis adequate fiber low energy density food , include use whole grain rather refine carbohydrate , limited liquid calorie , high variety low energy item fruit vegetable low variety high-energy discretionary food . Diet LG : modification HG diet low energy density maintain even though percent energy fat protein increase ( increase use high-protein food food high water content ) use different carbohydrate source physically intact food item ( whole grain , raw fruit vegetable ) low glycemic load reduce glycemic index ( GI ) . High fiber intake , low energy density , limited use liquid calorie , high variety low energy item fruit vegetable low variety high-energy discretionary food HG diet .</detailed_description>
