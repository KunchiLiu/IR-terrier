Those receive placebo receive total quantity beverage receive alcohol . Both alcohol-dosed placebo-dosed participant breath-tested complete required dose . Participants sleep study site monitor overnight . The next morning awaken escort exam room performance trial , include quiz lecture read material , GRE examination , NES3 battery PVT .
