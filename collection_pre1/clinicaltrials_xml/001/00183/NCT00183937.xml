	<brief_summary>This study patient treat surgical removal testes hormone therapy ( Lupron Zoladex ) whose prostate cancer worsen despite treatment . PS 341 type drug know `` proteasome inhibitor . '' By inhibit `` proteasome '' cancer cell , PS-341 alters way cell divide ) . We hope learn whether combination chemotherapy decrease cancer symptom test ( prostate specific antigen , also call PSA ) , determine frequently serious side effect might occur treatment stage prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

Patients must metastatic prostate cancer deem hormone refractory one following ( despite androgen ablation antiandrogen withdrawal applicable ) : Progression measurable disease assess within 28 day prior registration . OR Progression nonmeasurable ( i.e . bone scan PET scan ) disease assess within 42 day prior registration . AND Rising PSA define least 2 consecutive rise PSA document reference value ( measure 1 ) . The first rise PSA ( measure 2 ) take least 7 day reference value . A third confirmatory PSA measure require ( 2nd beyond reference level ) great second measure must obtain least 7 day 2nd measure . Patient must PSA concentration least 5 ng/ml addition increase PSA eligible Note : The PSA result ( do within 28 day prior registration ) need elevate inclusion provide criterion progression meet serum PSA least 2 ng/ml . Must receive prior hormonal therapy castrate level testosterone ( le 100ng/ml within 90 day entry study ) . Patients treat orchiectomy eligible .
