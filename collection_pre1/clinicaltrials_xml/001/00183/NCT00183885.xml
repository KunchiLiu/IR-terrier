	<brief_summary>This study people cancer liver completely remove surgery . This study involve give drug mitomycin-C cisplatin , artery liver . Mitomycin-C drug approve FDA treat cancer stomach pancreas . Mitomycin-C drug cause cancer cell die prevents reproduce . Cisplatin also drug approve FDA . Cisplatin approve treat cancer testis , ovary , lung , esophagus , bladder , head neck . Cisplatin drug prevents cancer cell reproduce . The purpose study see long take subject ' tumor ( ) grow receive study drug . Another purpose study look side effect study therapy long subject survive receiving . An additional purpose study see well predict subject ' response study therapy , base blood tumor tissue test . These test measure level gene ( cell 's blueprint ) subject ' tumor blood . These gene affect people 's body react cancer drug .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Unresectable , histologically confirm hepatocellular carcinoma evident disease limit liver . Tissue tumor must available . This may paraffin embedded tissue previous biopsy/resection available , repeat biopsy must perform . The requirement biopsy may waive alphafetoprotein great 500 ng/mL investigator opinion explain concurrent hepatic inflammatory process . Patients must agree 20 cc blood sample drawn addition routine lab cycle chemotherapy . Patients must measurable disease . If prior radiation therapy administer , measurable disease must outside radiation field . Patients must Zubrod performance status 02 . Patients must predict life expectancy least 12 week . Patients must pretreatment granulocyte count ( i.e. , segment neutrophils + band ) great equal 1,500/mm3 , hemoglobin level great equal 9 gm/dl , platelet count great equal 50,000/mm3 . The granulocyte requirement may waive investigator 's opinion lower count reflect hypersplenism adequate bone marrow reserve . Patients must adequate renal function document calculated creatinine clearance â‰¥ 60 . Patients must adequate hepatic function document serum bilirubin less equal 2x institutional upper limit normal , regardless whether patient liver involvement secondary tumor . Patients may ascites ascites must responsive diuretic . Patients receive prior chemotherapy unresectable disease Patients active uncontrolled infection , include know HIV infection . ( Patients active hepatitis B place lamivudine . Patients active hepatitis C eligible liver test qualify ( 5.1.9 ) Patients psychiatric disorder would interfere consent followup . Pregnant lactating woman . Men woman reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method . Patients severe concurrent disease , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
