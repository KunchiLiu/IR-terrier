	<brief_summary>Alemtuzumab man-made antibody use treat certain blood disorder . This study evaluate treatment kidney transplant recipient alemtuzumab immune system suppress medication without infusion bone marrow stem cell kidney donor . The purpose study find strategy effective preventing organ rejection maintain patient health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Donor Stem Cells Alemtuzumab Prevent Organ Rejection Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Organ transplantation common procedure hospital , organ rejection serious side effect potential problem patient . Mycophenolate mofetil , sirolimus , tacrolimus drug use decrease immune system activity people receive organ transplant new organ reject . Alemtuzumab monoclonal antibody bind deplete excess T cell bone marrow leukemia patient . In study , alemtuzumab use destroy recipient 's white blood cell ( WBCs ) time transplantation . It hop WBCs produce alemtuzumab administration recognize transplant liver `` self '' attack new kidney . To assist immune system accept donor kidney , patient study also receive two infusion bone marrow stem cell kidney donor . Bone marrow stem cell adult blood cell specialize blood cell , T cell , develop . Treatment cell believe create state `` chimerism '' body , immune cell donor recipient coexist tolerate presence donor organ . This study evaluate safety effectiveness antirejection regimen include alemtuzumab immunosuppressive medication donor bone marrow stem cell infusion patient undergo kidney transplantation . This study last 3 year . Participants randomly assign receive either full immunosuppressive therapy donor bone marrow stem cell infusion ( Group 1 ) immunosuppressive therapy alone ( Group 2 ) . Patients undergo kidney transplantation start study Day 0 . Patients receive inpatient infusion alemtuzumab Days 0 4 . Starting Day 0 , patient begin take mycophenolate mofetil ; start Day 1 , patient also begin take tacrolimus . On Day 5 , patient Group 1 receive first 2 infusion purified stem cell take kidney donor 's bone marrow ; second infusion stem cell occur sometime Months 4 6 post-transplant . Beginning Months 4 6 post-transplant , participant begin receive low-dose maintenance immunosuppressive therapy sirolimus , typical post-transplant antirejection therapy . One year post-transplant , patient evaluate potential withdraw maintenance immunotherapy . Participants monitor 3 year post-transplant . Urine collection occur Week 1 Months 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 . At Months 12 , 24 , 30 , participant undergo kidney biopsy . Blood collection occur regular interval laboratory test evaluate immune system 's response transplant kidney .</detailed_description>
