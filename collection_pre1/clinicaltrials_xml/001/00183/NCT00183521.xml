	<detailed_description>PD serious condition characterize episode rapid heart rate , difficulty breathing , symptom fear . Explanations panic attack propose two theory : suffocation alarm theory hyperventilation theory . The suffocation alarm theory claim panic attack due `` suffocation monitor '' brain , erroneously signal lack useful air . The hyperventilation theory suggest stressful event cause people slightly hyperventilate ; people panic attack result overreaction dizziness lightheadedness feel hyperventilation . Both theory note role carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) panic attack ; suggest rise CO2 level arterial blood act panic stimulus . This study compare two type breathe regulation technique base panic attack theory determine effective reduce panic symptom people PD . This study last 4 week include people PD without condition . Participants randomly assign one three group : raise-CO2 breathing , lower-CO2 breathing , control group . Participants raise-CO2 lower-CO2 breathing group five session training learn specific breathe technique . Participants raise-CO2 group teach technique recover hyperventilation faster ; participant lower-CO2 group teach technique reach hyperventilation level , switch breathe technique reduce hyperventilation symptom . Participants control group teach breathe technique include assessment . Participants assess study entry , breathe training session , Months 1 6 study . During assessment , questionnaires self-report scale use measure cognitive , psychological , physiological change relate participant ' breathing .</detailed_description>
