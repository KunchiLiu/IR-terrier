	<brief_title>Brain Energy Metabolism Individuals With Major Depressive Disorder Receiving Escitalopram</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) severe form depression . MDD significantly interfere individual 's thought , behavior , mood , physical health . People suffer MDD often experience feeling worthlessness ; may feel hopeless may unable cope problem life . In addition , often experience sleep disruption , loss appetite , chronic pain . Antidepressant medication often prescribe treat MDD ; however , 30 % 40 % individual fail respond adequately medication . Preliminary research show low level brain energy metabolism often associate MDD . No study yet show whether difference brain energy metabolism individual respond well antidepressant versus . Escitalopram antidepressant medication often use treat MDD . It cause calm effect reduces anxiety increase amount serotonin brain . This study compare change brain energy metabolism due treatment escitalopram individual MDD . In turn , finding may aid understand relationship brain energy metabolism depression , may guide future antidepressant trial . This 12-week study enroll individual diagnose MDD , well healthy individual . During Weeks 1 4 , participant MDD receive 10 mg escitalopram daily basis . If participant respond well medication , determine study clinician , dose may increase 20 mg per day Weeks 5 8 . If participant continue respond medication 8 week , dose may increase 30 mg per day Weeks 9 12 . Study visit occur every week throughout 12 week . Laboratory test , physical examination , vital sign measurement perform study visit . Outcome measurement include depression level assess standardized psychological test questionnaire , well brain energy metabolite level assess magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . The MRS MRI scan occur baseline , Week 2 , Week 12 ; entire scanning procedure last 70-80 minute . Following end study , participant offer follow-up medical care 3 month . Participants respond well escitalopram offer continued treatment drug , respond well escitalopram offer treatment another antidepressant .</detailed_description>
