	<brief_summary>This study people advance gastric gastroesophageal cancer . This study do find long take tumor grow patient take drug capecitabine , oxaliplatin cetuximab . Capecitabine ( also call Xeloda ) drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Capecitabine approve treatment cancer colon rectum . Oxaliplatin another drug approve FDA . Oxaliplatin also approve treatment cancer colon rectum . Cetuximab also drug approve FDA treatment cancer colon rectum , well cancer head neck . Capecitabine , oxaliplatin cetuximab approve gastric gastroesophageal cancer . They consider experimental drug study . The purpose study see long take patient ' tumor progress take oxaliplatin capecitabine . Another purpose see many tumor respond drug combination . The investigator also want see long people live take drug . The side effect drug combination also evaluate . This study also measure level certain gene ( cell 's blueprint ) tumor . These gene affect people ' body react cancer drug . Genes also measure blood . The investigator want see gene predict response study drug .</brief_summary>
