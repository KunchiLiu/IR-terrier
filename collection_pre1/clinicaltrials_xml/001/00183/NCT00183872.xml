	<brief_summary>This study people advance gastric gastroesophageal cancer . This study do find long take tumor grow receive treatment drug irinotecan ( also know CPT-11 ) docetaxel ( also know Taxotere ) . Irinotecan drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Irinotecan approve treatment cancer colon rectum . Docetaxel another drug approve FDA . Docetaxel approve treatment breast , prostate lung cancer . However , FDA authorize use irinotecan docetaxel study . This study evaluate effect drug participant 's tumor . The side effect combination irinotecan docetaxel also evaluate . This study also measure level certain substance participant 's tumor . These substance , call gene ( cell 's blueprint ) , affect people 's body react cancer drug . Genes also measure participant 's blood . The researcher want see substance predict response study drug .</brief_summary>
