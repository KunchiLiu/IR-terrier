	<brief_summary>This study patient cancer esophagus . This study use drug irinotecan , cisplatin celecoxib . Irinotecan ( also know CPT-11 ) recently approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use colon cancer , approve FDA use treatment cancer esophagus . Cisplatin drug commonly use treat patient cancer esophagus . We combine two chemotherapy drug drug call Celebrex . Celebrex ( also call Celecoxib ) oral medication approve FDA pain treatment arthritis . There information suggest drug may anti-cancer activity . In prior study combine irinotecan cisplatin , tumor esophagus show shrink . We add Celebrex drug see make drug work well shrink cancer cause few side effect .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must clinically document unresectable metastatic esophageal cancer histologic confirmation diagnosis tumor . To unresectable patient must examine surgeon declare unresectable . Tissue tumor must available . This may paraffin embedded tissue previous biopsy/resection available , repeat biopsy must perform . Patients must agree sample 20 cc drawn addition routine lab cycle chemotherapy . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . If prior radiation therapy administer , measurable disease must outside radiation field . Patients may receive prior adjuvant chemotherapy ; must complete least 6 month prior initiation therapy metastatic disease . Patients must Zubrod performance status 02 . Patients must predict life expectancy least 12 week . Patients must pretreatment granulocyte count ( i.e. , segment neutrophils + band ) &gt; 1,500/mm3 , hemoglobin level great equal to9.0 gm/dl , platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 . Patients must adequate renal function document 1 ) creatinine less equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal OR 2 ) creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min calculate Patients must adequate hepatic function document serum bilirubin less equal 2x institutional upper limit normal , regardless whether patient liver involvement secondary tumor . Aspartate transaminase ( SGOT ) must less equal 3x institutional upper limit normal , unless liver involved tumor , case aspartate transaminase must less equal 5x institutional upper limit normal . No major surgery within 1 month start study drug . Patients receive prior therapy CPT11 cisplatin adjuvant therapy le 12 month prior initiation therapy metastatic disease . All adjuvant chemotherapy must complete least 6 month prior entry onto trial . Prior treatment celebrex , patient currently use celebrex regular basis treatment disorder , i.e arthritis , etc . Patients receive prior treatment metastatic unresectable disease Patients take fulldose NSAIDs , include aspirin , regularly reason ( e.g. , arthritis , history TIA myocardial infarction ) . Patients take cardiac preventive dose ASA ( &lt; 81mg daily ) eligible . Patients stop take NSAIDs 14 day prior receive first dose Celecoxib . Patients may history allergy sulfonamide drug . Patients may active peptic ulcer disease contraindication chronic NSAID use aspirin use . Patients may know lactose intolerance . Patients active uncontrolled infection , include know HIV infection Patients psychiatric disorder would interfere consent followup Patients history myocardial infarction within previous six month congestive heart failure require therapy Pregnant lactate woman .
