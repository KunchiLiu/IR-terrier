Anhedonia recognize core symptom depression always remedied antidepressant medication . Abnormal brain activity processing may underlie cause depression specifically anhedonia . A good understanding brain mechanism depression may lead development new effective medication psychological treatment . Event-related potential ( ERP ) , measure electrical activity brain , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , use scan image illustrate change brain activity , two technique identify abnormal area brain processing . The purpose study use ERP fMRI compare brain activity relate reward processing individual MDD versus individual without MDD . This study consist 3 study visit ; visit schedule close together possible . At first study visit , potential participant assess SCID ( Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ) , identify individual diagnostic criterion MDD . A control group non-depressed individual also enrol study . During second third study visit , participant take part monetary reinforcement reward task follow signal detection reward task . Brain activity participant monitor task . During second study visit , ERP use ; third study visit , fMRI use . Demographic information also collect , participant complete several standardized questionnaire assess mood . Some participant ask return eight week complete fMRI EEG session . Those complete five session award bonus .</detailed_description>
