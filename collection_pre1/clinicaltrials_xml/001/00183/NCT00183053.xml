	<brief_title>Proximity Alarms Reduce Patient Falls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proximity alarm system promote approach reduce fall decrease use physical restraint hospital , test rigorously . This study implement proximity alarm Methodist-University Hospital ( M-UH ) , 652-bed urban community hospital Memphis , Tennessee . The hospital provide primary tertiary care diverse adult patient population . The group randomize trial conduct 16 25-bed general medical-surgical nursing unit M-UH . Nursing unit randomize within block 2 base rate fall occur initial 3-month observation period . Over 15-month intervention , 8 nurse unit randomize receive alarm-based intervention , 8 utilize exist nursing care method minimize fall . Intervention unit receive adequate supply proximity alarm monitoring system apply patient consider nursing staff high risk fall . An implementation team , consist nurse-champion , geriatrician biomedical instrumentation specialist , train conduct regular follow-up intervention unit address technical issue relate use alarm . The primary outcome measure , patient fall , ascertain prospectively nurse-manager use method develop collect patient ( e.g. , orientation postural blood pressure ) environmental data collect standardized manner . The primary aim study determine whether proximity alarm monitoring reduces fall . The study design test hypothesis patient fall 25 % low intervention unit compare control unit . The secondary aim determine whether proximity alarm monitoring reduces use physical restraint , decrease patient care cost . This first methodologically sound study evaluate promise approach reduce fall hospital . Whether alarm successfully reduce fall , finding study potential widely impact purchasing decision clinical practice relate fall prevention acute-care setting .</detailed_description>
