	<detailed_description>Preterm birth remain lead public health problem obstetrics . A recent analysis neonatal mortality ( death age &lt; 28 day ) United States 1989 2001 reveal preterm delivery ( &lt; 37 week ) account 70 % neonatal deaths.9 In addition risk neonatal death , preterm infant increase risk long-term neurologic developmental morbidity , estimate risk significant handicap 15 % survivor . These statistic lead many investigator identify woman great risk ( e.g. , prior preterm delivery , multiple gestation , maternal weight &lt; 50 kg , African-American race , bleeding , concurrent sexually transmitted disease ) . Despite identification risk factor , reproducible effective method prevent preterm delivery demonstrate . On contrary , preterm birth rate rise 27 % since 1981.1 A significant contributor tremendous rise increase rate multiple gestation observe past year . This partly due advance assist reproductive technology twin gestation account around quarter pregnancy conceive follow procedure . One modality show promise prevention preterm labor small trial treatment progestational agent . Two separate meta-analyses assess effect progesterone preterm labor arrive contradictory conclusion . Goldstein find evidence effectiveness progestational compound prevention preterm delivery . Daya , hand , show beneficial effect . A third meta-analysis , restrict trial 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate show , composite , significant reduction rate preterm delivery . A recently report trial compare 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate therapy placebo prevent preterm birth select , high-risk group woman ( documented history previous spontaneous preterm birth &lt; 37 week gestation ) terminate prematurely result show significant protection recurrent preterm birth woman receive 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate . Other study , use form progesterone , demonstrate beneficial effect . A study 1980 fail show benefit 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate woman twin gestation . In study , 77 woman twin gestation treat last trim weekly injection either 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate placebo . The study limit small sample size . In addition , progesterone therapy start late third trimester gestation could partly explain inability detect beneficial effect progesterone group patient use particular regimen . Most reported trial progesterone compound fail demonstrate substantial effect reduce risk preterm delivery . However , recent small randomize placebo-controlled trial supplemental vaginal progesterone woman high risk preterm birth reveal preterm birth rate le 34 week gestation significantly low among woman receive progesterone among receive placebo.8 The result study National Institute Child Health Human Development7 support hypothesis progesterone supplementation reduces preterm birth select high-risk group woman . In fact , American College Obstetricians Gynecologists Committee Obstetric Practice believe study need evaluate use progesterone patient high-risk obstetric factor , multiple gestation , short cervical length , positive test result cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin . The mechanisms action 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate prolong gestation entirely know . They include relaxation myometrial smooth muscle , block action oxytocin , inhibition formation gap junction . There also evidence local change progesterone level ratio progesterone estrogen placenta , decidua , fetal membrane may important initiation labor human . As safety profile , aside local injection-site reaction like soreness , swell , itch bruising , 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate appear safe pregnancy absence teratogenic effect . The safety 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate administration pregnancy well document animal clinical study . Reviews topic knowledgeable author uniformly conclude evidence exists administration 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate pregnancy represent significant risk mother , fetus newborn . SPECIFIC AIM ( S ) : To test effectiveness weekly injection 250 mg 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate compare placebo prevention preterm delivery patient twin gestation , give 16-20 week gestation 36 week . We choose 250 mg dose 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate dose use study show beneficial effect medication prevention preterm delivery . The study hypothesis placebo equivalent efficacy 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate prevent preterm delivery twin pregnancy . participate trial . Randomization procedure : - We stratify patient reduced/non-reduced IVF/ no-IVF . Patients randomized different treatment group use permuted block randomization . - Randomization envelope prepare mean random number table . Randomization occur 16 week 20 week gestation whereby next numbered opaque envelope open assign consent patient receive identically appear active 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate ( Proluton® Depot , Schering AG , Germany ) placebo ( castor oil ) injection prepare pharmacy . - The woman , obstetrician , research personnel blind study medication allocation . - A 2:1 ratio use assignment woman 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate placebo , patient assign placebo would receive painful injection weekly basis possibility direct benefit . Routine study procedure : - An ultrasonographic examination , routine procedure do every pregnant patient , perform 14 week 20 week gestation confirm gestational age identify major fetal anomaly . - Gestational age calculate base last menstrual period and/or first trimester ultrasonography spontaneously conceive twin day egg retrieval twin conceive assisted reproductive technology . Interventions : - After consent , patient offer come weekly injection 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate ( 250 mg ) placebo give study nurse . If come weekly injection , handle medication time follow visit obstetrician give private nurse , whichever convenient . In order avoid burden clinic staff , decide use OPD premise 11:30 a.m. 1:30 p.m. , time OPD session . Flow sheet document date injection available RA , obviate need pull patient chart . The financial compensation staff-nurse comply AUMBC rule regulation . - For patient elect receive injection home , call day injection remind injection ensure receive medication due time . - The patient categorized non-compliant ≥ 10 day-gap two injection . - The injection continue 36 week gestation delivery , whichever occur first . - In addition weekly visit study injection , woman receive routine prenatal care obstetrician . Twin gestation department usually ask come routine checkup visit every 3-4 week first second trimester every 2 week 28 week 36 week weekly thereafter . - The possible side effect medication , write consent form , explain patient research assistant . - If patient go preterm delivery , manage obstetrician accord standard protocol might necessitate admission even tocolysis . In case , injection continue weekly basis till 36 week gestation delivery , whichever occur first . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform use SPSS statistical package adjust stratified design . The analysis do intent-to-treat basis . Categorical data like maternal characteristic rate neonatal morbidity compare use Chi square sample size support approximation . Otherwise , categorical data analyze two-tailed Fisher exact test expect cell frequency small . Continuous variable compare Student test assumption normality homogeneity variance appear reasonable Wilcoxon rank-sum test . Unpaired variable difference distribution compare use Mann-Whitney test . Neonatal outcomes analyze assumption neonatal outcome variable occurs least one fetus , pregnancy consider affect variable . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . A Logistic regression model include confound variable check contribution primary outcome . The variable go control include : need tocolysis , BMI , smoking , assist reproductive technology , prior preterm delivery , prior term delivery , spontaneous reduce twin , etc … . Prolongation pregnancy assess life-table method . The duration consider period time randomization time woman give birth , lose follow-up , reach 40 week gestation , whichever come first . CLINICAL RELEVANCE AND LIMITATIONS - Managing preterm neonate major burden health system medically financially . The result study therefore major implication treatment prof effective reduce preterm delivery twin . - Limitations : Since study limit twin gestation , result generalize singleton without risk factor preterm labor high order gestation .</detailed_description>
