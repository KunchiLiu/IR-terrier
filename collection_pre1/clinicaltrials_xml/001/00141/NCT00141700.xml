	<brief_title>Study Rituximab Plus High-Dose Chemotherapy Poor Prognosis Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination chemotherapy standard treatment initial therapy aggressive NHL . Standard chemotherapy cure less 40 % patient . High-dose chemotherapy stem cell support ( transplant ) show positive result patient NHL fail standard chemotherapy . The cure rate treatment 50 % . Another treatment option call immunotherapy test lymphoma patient see add immunotherapy NHL treatments improve result . Rituximab , form immunotherapy , antibody ( type protein ) attack CD20 protein find lymphoma cell , may result death lymphoma cell . The study design follow : Patients poor prognosis NHL receive rituximab part peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilization process part preparative regimen combination high-dose chemotherapy . Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cell ( PBPC ) collect store . After recovery high-dose cyclophosphamide , patient admit hospital transplant . The preparative regimen consist rituximab , follow high-dose chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
