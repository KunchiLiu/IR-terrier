	<brief_title>Study Etanercept Prevention Complications Resulting From Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( HSCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial see addition etanercept help prevent two major complication hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . The main objective see whether addition etanercept standard preventative medicine decrease rate acute graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) risk death 100 day follow allogeneic HSCT volunteer donor . GVHD common complication follow bone marrow transplant another donor . GVHD occur transplant donor 's blood cell recognize part body foreign . During process , chemical call cytokine release may damage certain body tissue , include gut , liver skin . Some main effect include red skin rash , diarrhea , sometimes blood , yellow jaundice . It range mild life threaten often require admission hospital treatment . The standard treatment acute GVHD combination steroid another drug suppress immune system , tacrolimus cyclosporine . Etanercept drug block chemical call Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) cause damage tissue . The purpose etanercept help improve response standard treatment GVHD . Previous study show less 50 % patient respond fully GVHD treatment . Without good response , patient often prolonged treatment disease , often involve hospitalization sometimes even death . Etanercept ( Enbrel ) add standard treatment see low rate GVHD risk death GVHD block TNF .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must 1 60 year age candidate myeloablative donor stem cell transplantation Patients must receive myeloablative regimen use fludarabine busulfan For related donor : The donor recipient must 5/6 match HLA A , B , DRB1 locus . [ Patients 6/6 related donor NOT eligible . ] For unrelated donor : The donor recipient must 5/6 6/6 match HLA A , B , DRB1 locus . The type level define match A B locus must level midresolution DNA typing . The acceptable level define match DRB1 allelic type high resolution DNA sequencing . Any disease myeloablative transplantation appropriate eligible except : Progressive poorly control malignancy likelihood durable disease control [ i.e. , patient expect least 6 month PFS date transplant ] &lt; 25 % . Not candidate myeloablative conditioning regimen use current BMT program clinical guideline . Patient 6/6 HLAmatched related donor Karnofsky Lansky performance status &lt; 60 % time admission HSCT Patients evidence HIV infection opportunistic infection include limited tuberculosis histoplasmosis . Any condition , opinion transplant team substance abuse , severe personality disorder would keep patient comply need protocol would markedly increase morbidity mortality procedure . Pregnancy . Tcell deplete allograft Patients document infection , respond well antibiotic therapy . Patients bacteremia .</criteria>
