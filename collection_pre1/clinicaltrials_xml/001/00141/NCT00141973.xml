	<brief_summary>A systemic treatment corticosteroid advocate various bacterial infectious disease . Since production CRP down-regulated corticosteroid , small increase rapid decrease acute phase protein : 1. suggest attenuate systemic inflammation , 2. necessarily reflect adequate therapy infection . For several reason ( good diagnostic tool sepsis , induction decrease immunosuppressive therapy ) , procalcitonin could better marker activity sepsis patient corticosteroid . As issue yet examine investigator prospectively study time-course PTC CRP well-defined septic patient group , adjunction antibiotic therapy also receive systemic corticosteroid treatment compare similar group without corticosteroid treatment .</brief_summary>
