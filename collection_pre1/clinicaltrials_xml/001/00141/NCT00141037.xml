	<brief_title>Steroid-Free Versus Steroid-Based Immunosuppression Pediatric Renal ( Kidney ) Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corticosteroids ( steroid ) cornerstone immunosuppressive therapy kidney ( renal ) transplantation 40 year . However , poor growth bone loss cause use steroid devastate pediatric kidney recipient . The negative physical implication steroid use also greatly impact patient ' compliance prescribe steroid-containing regimen . The development steroid-free regimen post-transplant pediatric patient sorely need . This study evaluate safety efficacy steroid-free base treatment regimen child adolescent receive kidney transplant , compare standard care steroid-based regimen . Participants study pediatric patient end-stage kidney disease undergo kidney transplantation start study . Patients participate study 3 year . Participants randomize ( 1:1 ) one two group . The study include 23 study visit 3 year . A physical exam , medication history , adverse event report , blood pressure reading , growth assessment , blood collection occur visit . At time transplantation , participant kidney biopsy . Participants also undergo cataract screen within 4 month transplantation .</detailed_description>
