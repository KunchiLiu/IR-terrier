	<brief_title>Phase II Trial EOquin High-risk Superficial Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endpoints : Time recurrence , duration response safety Number Patients : 53 patient Study Design : Non-randomized , open-label study . Key Inclusion Criteria : High-risk patient accord EAU criterion define - pT1 and/or Grade 2b-3 , multiple highly recurrent - histologically confirm carcinoma situ ( CIS ) Key Exclusion Criteria : pTa Grade 1 pT1 Grade 1 tumor , exist urinary tract infection recurrent severe bacterial cystitis ; tolerate intravesical administration intravesical surgical manipulation due presence concomitant serious illness ; prior intravesical chemotherapy immunotherapy last three month ; prior EOquin treatment ( intravenous intravesical ) last 12 month . Study Treatment : All patient receive intravesical instillation EOquin™ 4-mg/40 mL instillate week six consecutive week Patient carcinoma situ ( CIS ) receive maintenance therapy 3 consecutive weekly EOquin instillation follow time point : 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month date TUR . At 3-month follow visit patient undergo cystoscopic bladder biopsy urine cytology . If bladder biopsy negative 3-month visit , follow remain visit cystoscopy urine cytology , do prior start maintenance therapy . In case positive cytology presence CIS confirm histologically biopsy . At 6 month follow-up , biopsy positive CIS , maintenance therapy give ; patient take off-study . Duration Patient Participation : Intravesical instillation EOquin™ give week six consecutive week . All patient follow-up evaluation carry 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 18 month TUR date progressive disease observe . In case recurrence , patient go study treatment investigator 's discretion . Off Study : Patients take study : - Upon first recurrence progression - Persistent CIS 6 month follow - Recurrent CIS biopsy proven complete response</detailed_description>
