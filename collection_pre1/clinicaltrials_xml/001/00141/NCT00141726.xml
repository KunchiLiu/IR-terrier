	<brief_title>Study Enbrel ( Etanercept ) Treatment Sub-Acute Pulmonary Dysfunction After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung breathe problem develop several month year follow bone marrow transplant . In case , breathe problem develop without sign germ infection lung . The name type breathing problem call `` Sub-Acute Lung Injury '' . Sub-acute lung injury often develop many month , even year follow bone marrow transplant . It often characterize shortness breath , cough , wheeze fatigue . Sub-acute lung injury either lead formation scar tissue lung ( make difficult take deep breath ) , cause lung get weak ( make people feel breath easily ) . Approximately 25 - 50 % patient sub-acute lung injury may eventually die damage lung . Typically , patient die infection develop inside damage lung . In study , treatment experimental drug call Etanercept use . ( Enbrel ) . The physician feel possibility Etanercept may help improve breathing . Breathing ability assess prior treatment well treatment comparison make .</detailed_description>
