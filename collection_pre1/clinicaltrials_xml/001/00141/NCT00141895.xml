	<brief_summary>Misoprostol ( Cytotec® ) synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog market United States since 1988 gastric cytoprotective agent . Despite focused campaign manufacturer curtail use obstetric practice , misoprostol , past several year , gain widespread acceptance effect medical termination pregnancy second trimester , either alone pretreatment mifepristone . The primary reason prompt incorporation standard practice include low cost lack stringent storage requirement . Vaginal administration seem efficacious give orally . The use sublingual misoprostol first trim abortion extensively investigate evidenced large number publication compare sublingual route misoprostol first trimester pregnancy termination , assumption sublingual route would similar efficacy vaginal route . In addition , sublingual route would combine easy administration add advantage restriction mobility administration . There previous report literature compare use misoprostol give sublingually give vaginally second trimester termination follow intrauterine fetal death . Our aim compare efficacy , safety patient satisfaction misoprostol give vaginally ( current standard ) give sublingually .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Two Regimens Misoprostol Second Trimester Termination Intrauterine Fetal Death</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostaglandins recognize effective abortifacient several decade . Misoprostol , synthetic analogue prostaglandin E1 , several advantage prostaglandin include low cost , easy storage room temperature , favorable side effect profile . In recent year , misoprostol attract attention effective cost-efficient agent medical interruption second-trimester pregnancy . Nowadays , misoprostol accept widely safe effective agent labor induction second trimester . Various dos , route , protocol medical termination pregnancy second trimester investigate . The optimal dosage route administration , however , yet define . Previous study demonstrate great efficacy vaginal misoprostol versus oral administration effect mid-trimester termination . However , oral administration medication prefer patient health care provider alike . The high efficacy vaginal administration may explain pharmacokinetics drug . Zeiman et al show systemic bioavailability vaginally administer misoprostol 3 time higher oral administration . Plasma concentration metabolite , misoprostol acid , peak one two hour vaginal application compare peak see 30 minute follow oral administration , although peak level low vaginal route , sustain longer overall exposure drug increase , perhaps presystemic gastrointestinal hepatic metabolism occur oral route . An additional explanation high efficacy could direct effect cervix initiate physiologic event lead increase uterine contractility . The sublingual route administration report literature prior 2001 . Since partly issue relate patient preference , investigator start study sublingual route administration misoprostol . In theory , sublingual route could mimic vaginal administration pharmacokinetically , although report study route administration . Although many study publish use sublingual misoprostol medical abortion first trimester , none do compare sublingual vaginal route case second trimester termination intrauterine fetal death . The 400-µg dose choose dose commonly use orally vaginally various study report literature . To best knowledge , study compare sublingual vaginal misoprostol termination pregnancy intrauterine fetal death second trimester previously publish literature . Therefore , study , complete provide evidence relative effect safety profile different route administration misoprostol indicate second trimester termination . The aim study compare efficacy 400-µg sublingual dose misoprostol Cytotec® ( Searle Pharmaceuticals , Bucks , United Kingdom ) administer 4-hour interval equivalent dose regimen administer vaginally woman admit second trimester termination intrauterine fetal death . In addition , want assess patient acceptability 2 mode administration . The study hypothesis sublingual route administration misoprostol effective vaginal route induction labor mid trim termination acceptable patient compare vaginal misoprostol . Randomization procedure : The randomization vaginal sublingual misoprostol base computer-generated table allocation conceal seal , sequentially number , brown envelope , prepare principal investigator involve clinical care patient . Because nature misoprostol administration , patient staff blind randomization allocation . Routine study procedure : - A pelvic exam do make sure patient eligible inclusion study ( Bishop 's score &lt; 8 ) . - Maternal pulse , blood pressure , temperature record every 4 hour ( time insertion Misoprostol ) . - After delivery fetus , patient receive 20 unit oxytocin 1000 mL intravenous crystalloid infusion rate 125 mL per hour . - Postpartum curettage perform discretion physician placenta deliver spontaneously 2 hour delivery fetus . - Patients receive intravenous narcotic epidural anesthesia need pain control . - Antiemetics , antipyretic , anxiolytic administer indicated . Interventions : The woman give full informed consent , randomize receive 400 µg vaginal sublingual misoprostol Cytotec® ( Searle Pharmaceuticals , Bucks , United Kingdom ) admission induction ward . This dose route administration repeat every 4 hour , require long patient undelivered 48 hour follow initiation induction . The induction categorize failed woman undelivered 48 hour would receive extraamniotic PGF2 instillation high-concentration intravenous oxytocin , depend cervical status amniotic membrane integrity . Another option would attempt cervical ripen vaginal Prostin tablet ( Upjohn Pharmaceuticals ) interval least four hour follow last dose misoprostol . - The woman complete brief questionnaire use visual analogue scale ascertain perception process term pain , control , overall opinion procedure every 12 hour . The woman perform pain scale assessment visual analogue ruler scale 0 10 , 0 represent perception pain 10 represent intense pain ever experience . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform use SPSS statistical package . Categoric data like maternal characteristic compare use Chi square sample size support approximation . Otherwise , categorical data analyze two-tailed Fisher exact test expect cell frequency small . Continuous variable compare Student test assumption normality homogeneity variance appear reasonable . Unpaired variable difference distribution compare use Mann-Whitney test . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
