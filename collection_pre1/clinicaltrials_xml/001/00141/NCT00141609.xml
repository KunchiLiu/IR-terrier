	<brief_summary>High blood pressure ( hypertension ) affect 80 % patient receive haemodialysis chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . High blood pressure major cause cardiovascular disease ( i.e . stroke , heart attack heart failure ) , thereby , cardiovascular death patient . A significant cause raise blood pressure haemodialysis patient think due retention salt body . In healthy people kidneys excrete salt kidney patient CKD , salt remove dialysis . However dialysis remove much salt necessary , accumulate . This fact recognize many year , health professional care haemodialysis patient often stress importance restriction dietary salt intake . However research look detail mechanism salt raise blood pressure haemodialysis patient . It likely salt directly affect thirst , cause patient drink become overloaded fluid . In addition , salt may direct effect blood vessel wall , cause failure adequate blood vessel relaxation . Both factor may raise blood pressure . We conduct carefully control crossover study look effect modest reduction salt intake BP . During course study , last eight week , patient receive 5 gram per day 10 gram per day salt intake . We look thirst , fluid intake , number marker blood vessel function blood pressure differ two salt intake .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High blood pressure ( BP ) major independent risk factor cardiovascular mortality individual haemodialysis , yet BP extremely poorly control population . Excessive dietary salt intake likely major cause hypertension patient . Firstly , excessive salt intake result thirst , excessive fluid intake weight gain dialysis , thereby chronic over-expansion extracellular fluid volume result high blood pressure . Secondly , salt may direct effect arterial tree contribute endothelial dysfunction clearly demonstrate uraemic individual , include haemodialysis patient . Abnormalities endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) production may play important role salt-sensitive hypertension , mediate potent inhibitor NO synthase , asymmetrical dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) . Plasma ADMA concentration several-fold high individual dialysis normal control , would interest see whether ADMA concentration decrease reduction dietary salt intake . In spite importance dietary salt intake haemodialysis patient , control study delineate mechanism salt intake affect BP . We propose conduct prospective double-blind placebo control cross-over study normal ( 10 12 gram salt per day ) versus modestly reduce ( 6 gram per day ) salt intake eight week period haemodialysis patient . The primary outcome measure change pre-dialysis systolic BP . Other outcome measure include mean systolic diastolic BP measure ABPM , thirst score , daily weight gain thoracic fluid content , measure thoracic bioimpedance . Furthermore , sub-group subject study change plasma ADMA concentration reduction salt intake , examine correlation change BP systemic vascular resistance .</detailed_description>
