	<brief_summary>This study examine brain activity associate involuntary urge uncontrolled movement , call `` tic , '' experience people Tourette syndrome ( TS ) . Before people TS actually develop tic , whether movement vocal tic ( like cough bark ) , feel urge tic . This study look brain activity time urge brain activity may differ people TS without TS . Healthy normal volunteer patient TS 14 65 year age may eligible study . Patients must sensory tic facial region must experience least moderate premonitory urge . Candidates screen medical history , brief physical examination , questionnaire . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) : This test record magnetic field change produce brain activity . During test , subject seat MEG record room cone contain magnetic field detector lower onto head . Electrodes ( small metal disk ) place side face near jaw . The recording may make subject receives small current electrodes jaw . Subjects may ask question felt procedure . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : This test use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . During procedure , subject lie table slide scanner-a metal cylinder . Subjects may ask lie still 30 minute time . They communicate staff time scan . - Somatosensory evoked response : This test examine sensory information travel form nerve spinal cord brain nervous system . An electrode place arm , leg , face delivers small electrical stimulus may tingle cause twitch hand , foot , face muscle . Additional electrode may sometimes place scalp , neck , collarbone record impulse stimulus travel nerve pathway . Patients study contact follow-up study . Follow-up conduct phone email , accord patient ' convenience , consist reaffirm adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : This study examine spatiotemporal dynamic sensory tic patient Tourette syndrome ( TS ) . We also investigate possible existence sensory gate problem . By investigate somatosensory evoked response stimulation trigeminal nerve ( tSERs ) affect versus unaffected side face , hope identify difference SER waveform suggest sensory abnormality . We use series short train stimulation affect side examine habituation , subsequently perform time- frequency analysis seek indicator decrease sensory gating . This study examine , specifically : Whether cortical neurocircuitry involve elicitation tSERs differs patient tic disorder control . If SERs differ sensory tic facial region patient , compare spot unaffected side face . Whether control patient sensory tic side body , tSERs side face symmetrical . If lack habituation tic patient tSERs short-train click paradigm , compare control . The location source abnormalities either paradigm . STUDY POPULATION : Twenty patient 10 control subject study . Subjects race , gender , handedness , age 14 65 year . DESIGN : This study compare tSERs normal volunteer TS patient . Patients bilateral sensory tic contrast unilateral sensory tic , compare power response latency affect versus unaffected side . Subjects seat MEG instruct `` feel delivered sensation , try tic seventy second , without count '' . The trigeminal nerve electrically stimulate 0.25 Hz 30 second , follow head localization subsequent rest tic release . To evaluate sensory gating , design similar except trigeminal stimulation occur short train . Patients survey determine instruction intensify sensory tic . OUTCOME MEASURES : We compare power average tSERs latency , compare face side patient compare patient ' active face side control ' dominant face side . The power frequency component latency consider . We locate source differential tSER activity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR NORMAL VOLUNTEERS : Subjects normal volunteer history neurological disorder ; screen NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic , neurological physical examination . Subjects male female , age range 14 65 year old . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS : Patients age 14 65 clinical diagnosis tourette syndrome chronic motor tic disorder define DSMIVTR evaluation tic severity use Yale Tic Scale ( YGTSS ) . This criterion establish preliminary screening NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic . Structure Clinical Interview ( DSMIV SCID ) administer subject ensure strict DSMIV criterion Tourette syndrome meet assess possible comorbid psychiatric disorder . Patients least moderate premonitory urge , evaluate PUTS . Patients sensory tic , either bilaterally unilaterally , facial region . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS AND NORMAL VOLUNTEERS : Cardiac pacemaker / cardiac neural defibrillator . Metal fragment eye . Metal plat , pin , bolt head . Any magnetic implantation / implantation make iron ( ferrous product ) . Hearing problem . Problems use response device . Subjects young 14 old 65 year . Subjects 1 ) major depression , 2 ) bipolar disorder , 3 ) psychotic disorder . Subjects take benzodiazepine , antidepressant neuroleptic medication . Subjects major acute chronic illness , subject sit still position extend period time would trigger exacerbate preexist condition cause undue harm discomfort . Pregnant woman ( steroidal hormone show influence EEG ( Rupprecht et al. , 2001 ) . Patients severe head tic subject unable hold head still scanner least 70 second .</criteria>
