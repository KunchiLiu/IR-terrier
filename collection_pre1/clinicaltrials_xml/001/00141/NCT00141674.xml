	<brief_summary>Donated red blood cell vary old , , long store since collect donor . Blood donate store maximum 42 day , time expire . That mean red blood cell give patient blood transfusion anywhere day old 42 day old . The average age blood give blood transfusion hospital 21 day old . As stored blood get old ability carry oxygen may reduce . Whether important patient brain injury currently know . The purpose study try determine fresh blood ( le 5 day old ) well old blood ( great 20 day old ) improve supply oxygen patient suffer injury brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE To demonstrate packed red blood cell ( pRBC ) less 5 day old superior older ( &gt; 20days ) blood improve marker cerebral oxygenation acutely head injured patient . HYPOTHESIS Transfusion pRBC result increase cerebral extraction oxygen . This effect great pRBC store great length time . JUSTIFICATION One main aim intensive management head injure patient prevention secondary hypoxic hypotensive insult already injured brain . Packed red blood cell transfusion commonly give trauma patient suffer anemia ( Hgb &lt; 100 g/l ) secondary blood loss order improve oxygen delivery vital organ include brain . Previous study show capacity pack red blood cell ( pRBC ) improve oxygen delivery tissue diminishes increase time storage . This storage lesion may improve time post transfusion ; however , may take many hour . Other study show association age pRBCs transfuse length stay trauma patient mortality septic ICU patient . Unused old blood likely send high volume center avoid waste precious resource . The effect 'old ' transfuse blood subject rigorous prospective study age blood show causally related adverse outcome mention , hence need study . The injured brain uniquely sensitive damage . Even brief secondary insult either hypotension hypoxia show significant adverse effect outcomes include permanent disability death . Furthermore measurement marker cerebral oxygenation form part standard care severely head injured patient institution give unique opportunity study effect blood transfusion group patient . The presence storage lesion pRBCs last even hour could significant impact head injure patient . If indeed 'fresh ' blood significantly improve marker cerebral oxygenation compare old blood could alter clinical practice significantly place priority transfuse 'fresh ' blood patient . The effect age pRBCs never study head injured population . Donated blood store maximum 42 day . The average age pRBC administer VGH 21 day . OBJECTIVES To evaluate effect transfuse `` fresh '' ( blood store less 5 day ) versus `` store '' ( blood store great 20 day ) pRBC cerebral oxygen extraction . We also evaluate effect transfusion pRBC cerebral oxygen extraction patient traumatic brain injury . RESEARCH METHOD This single centre randomize trial severely head injured patient require blood transfusion . Randomization computer generate random number pace sealed envelope . Patients would randomize receive either blood le 5 day old great 20 day old . The decision transfuse intensive care management unaltered enrolment study .</detailed_description>
