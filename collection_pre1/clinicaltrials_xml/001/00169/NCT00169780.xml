	<brief_summary>Current practice diagnosis urinary stone give little information probable fragility stone use shock wave lithotripsy ( SWL ) , many patient receive SW 's necessary break stone . Indeed , patient treat SWL stone fragment use technology . The investigator ample evidence compute tomography ( CT ) image kidney stone reveal significant internal structure stones—structure likely useful predict stone fragility—but one explore use clinical helical CT purpose . Also , investigator know effect human body wall kidney tissue resolution kidney stone structure helical CT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kidney Stone Structural Analysis By Helical Computed Tomography ( CT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Helical compute tomography become radiologic tool choice assessment treatment patient urinary tract calculus ( Hubert et al , 1997 ; Smith et al , 1999 ) . However , full potential helical CT differentiate among stone type structure radiodensity yet realize . Most CT scan stone use simply identify existence stone give indication size location . These scan view use soft tissue window , order look possible cause patient 's pain , appendicitis , gallstone , colonic diverticulitis . However , soft tissue windows show structure within kidney stone : stone appear bright white object image . The potential observing structure stone ( use view window closer use view bone ) assess clinical study . Currently , average CT attenuation value urinary tract calculus investigate indicator stone composition ( Nakada et al , 2000 ; Mostafavi et al , 1998 ; Kuwahara et al , 1984 ) . The average CT attenuation value show useful distinguishing stone ( uric acid calcium oxalate ) considerable overlap CT attenuation stone type exist . Treatment urinary tract calculus influence many factor include stone location , size composition . Shock wave lithotripsy ( SWL ) effective , non-invasive method utilized treat majority renal calculus . However , kidney stone easily fragment SWL , stone similar composition SW-resistant must remove invasive method follow fail lithotripsy . In addition , SWL without complication long-term risk hypertension renal insufficiency ( Evan et al , 1998 ; Willis et al , 1998 ) . Considerable variation SWL fragility exist within major stone composition group best explain stone structural heterogeneity ( Saw et al , 2000 ) . The association stone structure SWL fragility new concept Dretler Polykoff ( 1996 ) , retrospective study calcium oxalate stone , report four distinct pattern stone structure plain abdominal radiograph . Unfortunately , SWL fragility directly test author rely clinical intuition stone x-ray smooth radiodense ( usually high calcium oxalate monohydrate content ) tend hard fragment SWL . Finally , technology clinical CT continue advance . The late generation multidetector helical CT machine considerably improve image resolution single-detector CT technology . These quad-slice scanner 4 contiguous , parallel row x-ray detector combine high gantry rotation speed increase speed data collection factor high 8 conventional single-slice spiral CT scanner . The evolution single-slice multi-slice scanner alter image performance term contrast resolution , in-plane spatial resolution radiation dose irradiating volume . However benefit quad-slice spiral CT compare single-slice spiral CT significant . The scan may perform thin CT slice , mean high spatial resolution along longitudinal axis patient . The scan also perform much faster , mean improved temporal resolution less motion artifact . Thus , ability predict stone composition kidney stone CT attenuation value delineate structural feature necessary predict stone fragility lithotripter shock waves-if practical present technology-will certainly possible technology progress .</detailed_description>
