	<brief_summary>Urolithiasis common condition United States , associate significant morbidity even mortality . The commonly occur urinary calculus comprise calcium oxalate salt , recently , pathogenesis calcium oxalate calculus poorly understood . New evidence , however , suggest development calcium oxalate calculus may intimately associate hydroxyapatite ( HA ) plaque , also know Randall 's plaque , locate renal papilla . The investigator previously demonstrate Randall 's plaque originate thin ascend limb loop Henle , show Randall 's plaque compose HA ( Evan , Lingeman et al . 2003 ) . As well , amount Randall 's plaque correlate elevate level urinary calcium decrease urinary volume , risk factor formation calcium oxalate calculus ( Kuo , Lingeman et al . 2003 ) . In course previous study , investigator anecdotally note calcium oxalate stone often find attach Randall 's plaque , observation others report well ( Prien 1949 ; Carr 1954 ; Cifuentes Delatte , Minon-Cifuentes et al . 1987 ) . However , in-vivo , rigorous documentation `` attach stone '' relationship . Attached calculi represent important point pathogenesis calcium oxalate calculus , correspond moment time continuum HA plaque Randall calcium oxalate stone , thus link origin plaque development stone . A good understanding phenomenon attach calculi lead well understanding calcium oxalate stone form , may ultimately direct future intervention attenuate stone activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Attached Stone Project : Do Calcium Oxalate Renal Calculi Originate From Randall 's Plaque ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urolithiasis common condition United States , estimate prevalence 11.7 % age 70 . Furthermore , associate considerable patient morbidity occasional mortality ( Stamatelou , Francis et al . 2003 ) . Direct cost associate treatment renal calculus enormous , 600,000 stone relate medical procedure perform annually United States ( shock wave lithotripsy ( SWL ) , ureteroscopy ( URS ) , percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PERC ) , stone removal , ureteral stent , stone basketing ( source : Boston Scientific Corporation ) . Although last two decade see considerable advance less invasive technique treatment symptomatic stone episode , well progress mitigate risk new stone formation , knowledge incite lesion human urolithiasis remain rudimentary much debate . Until recently , sequence event lead formation urinary calculus poorly understood , fundamentally due lack appropriate in-vivo data . Earlier theory calculogenesis propose stone could result tubular epithelial injury due oxalate toxicity , lack urinary inhibitor crystal formation crystal epitaxy pre-existing nidus ( Khan , Finlayson et al . 1979 ) . Theoretical work free fix particle growth indicate transit time collect duct bladder 10 minute provide insufficient time crystal grow clinically meaningful size ( Jonassen , Cooney et al . 1999 ) . Morphological classification directional growth calculus support necessity fix point origin , absence obstruction ( Hinman 1979 ) . These observation suggest stone must initiate fix point nidus collect system renal papilla . One nidus , first describe sixty year ago Alexander Randall , propose originate lesion formation calcium oxalate stone ( Randall 1936 ; Randall 1937 ; Randall 1940 ) . In microscopic study renal papilla obtain necropsy , demonstrate presence 2-3mm lesion 19.6 % patient composed calcium phosphate devoid evidence inflammation . Adherent , 65 1,514 pair kidney , identify nascent stone compose calcium oxalate calcium phosphate . When stone reach sufficient size , hypothesize would break free , take underlying plaque . In subsequent work , 256 void remove calculus examine 106 give visible evidence mural attachment ( Randall 1940 ) . Later microradiographic study would confirm presence plaque papillary location could co-localized stone ( Carr 1954 ) . Unfortunately , early study stone pathogenesis suffer lack definition clear clinical stone-forming phenotype . There intrigue report support Randall 's , , hypothesis stone originate fix plaque compose HA . Earlier microscopic study stone structure demonstrate presence concavity small stone compatible point mural attachment indicate apatite may present attachment point ( Rosenow 1940 ; Prien 1949 ) . In early x-ray diffraction crystallographic study 10,000 urinary calculus , Herring note HA frequently find nucleus calcium oxalate monohydrate , usually small discoid plaque felt resemble Randall 's plaque ( Herring 1962 ) . Later , Chambers perform electron probe analysis 115 small renal calculus . Of 92 predominantly calcium oxalate stone , able identify small central area HA , usually 10-200 micron diameter , 70 ( Chambers , Hodgkinson et al . 1972 ) . Using scan electron microscopy x-ray dispersive energy , Cifuentes Delatte find 63 87 pass calcium oxalate stone evidence plaque ( Cifuentes Delatte , Minon-Cifuentes et al . 1985 ) . Observation uncalcified tubular lumen find conjunction plaque suggest interstitial papillary tip origin material ( Cifuentes Delatte , Minon-Cifuentes et al . 1987 ) . We note endoscopically examine renal papilla patient undergo PERC , oftentimes stone attach renal papilla encounter . We collect three attach stone three separate patient undergo PERC . The stone analyze Micro CT device , 3-D reconstruction identification mineral component perform . The stone show multiple mineral component , include calcium oxalate , apatite , probable region poorly mineralize matrix . Although significance various component , vary amount , yet well understood , apparent even early stage stone formation , multiple mineral complex arrangement present papilla-attached stone . It rigorous , prospectively design protocol significance attach renal calculus understood . By demonstrate renal calculi population common calcium oxalate stone former originate HA plaque , would link substantive way origin plaque subsequent development stone .</detailed_description>
