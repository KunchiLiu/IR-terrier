	<brief_title>Fludarabine , Mitoxantrone Rituximab Relapsed Primary Failing Advanced Follicular Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Follicular non Hodgkin 's lymphoma 's ( FL ) , define REAL Classification , usually characterize slowly progressive clinical course , transient control standard chemotherapeutic regimen pattern repeat relapse ultimately progressive fatal disease . Standard first line treatment advance FL consist alkylating-based ( CVP ) anthracycline contain regimen association interferon alpha ( CHVP+IFN ) chemotherapy . Others approach develop mostly secondary therapy include purine analog alone combination alkylators mitoxantrone , high dose therapy autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation , recently , treatment unconjugated chimeric anti-CD20 antibody ( rituximab ) target CD20 antigen highly express follicular lymphoma cell . None strategy appear give definitive survival advantage . Thus , patient FL , design novel combination program major challenge . Combination fludarabine mitoxantrone low grade , predominantly Follicular NHL : result phase II study relapse refractory patient Fludarabine expect potentiate agent inhibition DNA polymerase alpha DNA ligase consequent interference DNA repair process . The addition mitoxantrone increase cytotoxic effect fludarabine vitro . McLaughlin et al developed combination fludarabine , mitoxantrone dexamethasone ( FND ) , effective 51 patient recurrent low-grade lymphoma ( include 65 % FL ) , overall response rate 94 % ( 47 % complete response ( CR ) rate . The median duration response phase II study 21 month CR patient 9 month partial responder ( PR ) patient . The median survival failure-free survival time time entry onto FND study 34 14 month , respectively . Most major response evident two four course chemotherapy . The need continuation therapy beyond attainment remission suggest early relapse among patient early discontinuation therapy . The predominant toxic effect myelosuppression infection : neutropenia &lt; 500/µl 20 % course , thrombopenia &lt; 50000/µl 8 % course infection 12 % course . Non-hematological toxicity modest . FND appear comparable , less toxic combination etoposide , methylprednisolone , cytarabine , cisplatin ( ESHAP ) , one effective regimen available patient relapse indolent lymphoma . Others study confirm significant efficacy moderate toxicity profile combination salvage therapy low grade , predominantly follicular lymphoma . Moreover , omission corticosteroid reduces risk opportunistic infection , activity combination indolent lymphoma maintain . Preliminary data rituximab study alone combination chemotherapy relapse refractory low grade LNH In vitro , rituximab mediates complement dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) , antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) apoptosis . However , mechanism vivo anti-lymphoma effect remain largely unknown . Rituximab receive approval recurrent follicular lymphoma base response rate 50 % include 6 % complete response duration response , compare favorably single agent include fludarabine 2-CdA ( 15-19 ) . Median time progression responder around 13 month . Toxicity rituximab low easily manageable . An 8 dos schedule show confer significant advantage term response rate duration response four dos schedule . Rituximab show sensitize drug-resistant lymphoma cell line kill cytotoxic drug include fludarabine . Thus , may hypothesize combination rituximab , fludarabine mitoxantrone might lead synergistic / additive induction apoptosis different pathway lymphoma B-cells maintain indolent growth pattern . This approach may provide mean achieve long progression free survival relapse refractory patient FL . We opt four induction cycle rituximab , fludarabine mitoxantrone since : 1 . Four cycle combination fludarabine mitoxantrone generally sufficient ass response , 2. 4 dos schedule rituximab study efficient 3 ) The omission dexamethasone appear impair ORR DR combination fludarabine novantrone . Recycling start day 28 . Subsequently respond patient accord International criterion Working group 2 cycle combination fludarabine mitoxantrone rituximab .</detailed_description>
