	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate response rate toxicity association R-CHOP two schedule administration Velcade , B-cell CD 20 + lymphoma patient , age 18 80 year The goal get response rate least observed R-CHOP alone evaluate sequential test . The objective evaluate toxicity</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association Velcade R-CHOP Treatment B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The association monoclonal antibody Rituximab chemotherapy regimen B-cell lymphoma associate increase response rate event free survival compare chemotherapy alone ( Coiffier et al NEJM 2002 ) . It observe almost histological type B-cell lymphoma . No significant increase toxicity observe especially use regimen CHOP association R-CHOP standard B-cell malignancy CD20 positive . However , patient diffuse large cell lymphoma progress make complete response rate 75 % situation low grade lymphoma , although patient respond well chemotherapy complete remission rate average generally 50 % ( Marcus et al 2003 ) , Czuczman et al 1999 ) . There need improve association new innovative agent . Before run randomize study important evaluate like hood get improvement phase 2 study test tolerance efficacy well establish regimen . Bortezomib ( Velcade formerly PS 341 ) proteasome inhibitor show promising activity treatment refractory myeloma . As single agent indolent lymphoma , administer twice per week 2 week follow one week rest period already show activity phase 2 study . It well tolerate main toxicity neuropathy thrombocytopenia . Proteasome inhibitor act multiple mechanism arrest tumor growth , tumor spread , angiogenesis . In vitro study show synergistic effect association Velcade doxorubicin myeloma cell line resistant chemotherapy . Association Velcade standard chemotherapy regimen study aim improve result . Association Velcade one efficient treatment B-cell lymphoma , R-CHOP , might increase response rate . However , different schedule explore order well appreciate efficacy toxicity . This randomized phase 2 study design evaluate response rate toxicity two schedule administration Velcade association R-CHOP . The aim study establish well tolerated regimen give response rate limit upper/lower observed conventional R-CHOP use different histological subtypes B cell lymphoma patient require treatment . The heterogeneity population preclude meaningful subgroup analysis . It important evaluate tolerability explore efficacy new regimen large randomized study specific phase II study need 50 patient subgroup patient .</detailed_description>
