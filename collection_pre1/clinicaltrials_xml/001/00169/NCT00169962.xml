	<brief_summary>Even current standard ED treatments 20-25 % patient present ED acute asthma episode still require hospitalization . For patient unresponsive beta-agonists admit rate higher . Of well enough discharge ED nearly 30 % relapse within one month . More 5,000 patient asthma still die year USA . For patient respond beta-agonists , relatively treatment option rapid improvement symptom pulmonary function . Presumably , mucous secretion plug play important role pathogenesis severe asthma unresponsive beta-agonists . The use agent promote clearance intra-luminal secretion mucous plug may represent important advance management acutely ill asthmatic , hasten recovery prevent deterioration acute care set prevent relapse discharge ED . OBJECTIVES 2.1 Study Hypothesis : rhDNAse safely use patient present Emergency Department acute moderate-severe asthma adequate response beta-agonists Project Specific Aim : This pilot study determine safety three different dos pulmozymeÂ® ( 2.5mg , 5.0mg 7.5mg ) patient present ED acute asthma . In addition safety trend improvement pulmonary function clinical outcome monitor data analyze . Based safety profile observable response treatment , information may use develop large trial determine efficacy dose strategy treat acutely ill asthmatic rhDNAse .</brief_summary>
