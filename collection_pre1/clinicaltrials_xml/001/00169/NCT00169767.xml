	<brief_summary>Many option currently exist relieve symptom cause benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) . At present , transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) serve surgical standard operative treatment compare . Although TURP provide excellent short long-term result , procedure many potential risk complication . The desire avoid potential risk TURP still achieve result comparable durability lead development alternative surgical procedure . One surgical alternative treatment BPH holmium laser ablation prostate ( HoLAP ) . HoLAP compare TURP randomize clinical trial comparable outcome uroflow rate symptom score improvement ( Mottet , et al 1999 ) . Use holmium laser treat BPH provide specific advantage TURP . The risk dilutional hyponatremia eliminate , holmium laser use conjunction normal saline irrigant . In addition , hemostatic property holmium laser result superior hemostasis , thus minimize risk bleeding . HoLAP utilized prostate gland 60 gram volume , large glands become inefficient treat use tissue vaporization technique . Recently , another laser technology introduce surgical treatment BPH , potassium titanyl-phosphate ( KTP ) laser . This modality also use vaporize obstructive prostate tissue , study single arm clinical study . Short-term result promise , significant improvement void symptom urine flow rate well minimal associate morbidity . However , date randomize comparison study HoLAP KTP laser vaporization prostate report . A group investigator extensive experience procedure intend objectively compare two procedure randomize clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The traditional surgical therapy BPH transurethral resection prostate ( McConnell et al , 1994 ) . This surgery involve insertion telescope ( resectoscope ) transurethrally prostate bladder . An electrocautery loop attach resectoscope use core inside prostate surgical capsule prostate reach . A large catheter leave bladder least 1 day saline irrigation bladder often require post-operative bleeding . Once urine clear , catheter remove patient undergoes void trial . If void successful , patient discharge home . TURP produce excellent short long-term result remain standard care surgical treatment BPH . Unfortunately , durable procedure many potential risk complication include bleed require blood transfusion ( ~5 % ) , intraoperative complication ( e.g . prostate capsule perforation ) , urethral bladder injury , dilutional hyponatremia TUR syndrome , urinary tract infection ( ~5-10 % ) , incontinence ( ~1 % ) , erectile dysfunction ( ~5 % ) , bladder neck contracture urethral stricture ( ~5 % ) , delay bleed result clot retention secondary procedure control bleed . ( American Urological Association [ AUA ] Guideline Management Benign Hyperplasia ( 2003 ) . Chapter 1 : Diagnosis Treatment Recommendations Journal Urology , 170 : 530 , 2003 . ) One alternative TURP show randomized clinical trial reproduce excellent result TURP holmium laser ablation prostate ( HoLAP ) ( Mottet et al , 1999 ) . HoLAP simple procedure perform small prostate gland ( ideally &lt; 60 gm ) recently report result suggest procedure produce good result durable 7 year ( Gilling et al , 2002 ) . A new technology use prostate ablation high power potassium titanyl-phosphate ( KTP ) laser ( Malek et al , 2000 ) . This surgical procedure involve use Laserscope™ KTP laser ( San Jose , CA ) vaporize obstruct prostatic tissue technique similar HoLAP . Most investigator report significant complication new technology case , significant improvement American Urological Association symptom score urine flow rate document ( Malek et al , 2000 ) . Unfortunately , randomize comparison study HoLAP KTP laser prostatectomy perform .</detailed_description>
