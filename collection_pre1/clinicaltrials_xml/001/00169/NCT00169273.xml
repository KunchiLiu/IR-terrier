	<brief_summary>We propose : - Conduct cross-sectional assessment depression , disability , health-related quality life , eat pattern , eat attitude population-based sample approximately 6000 woman age 40-60 over-sampling woman BMI great 30 kg/m2 . - Among obese woman free depression , enroll approximately 100 6-month standard behavior therapy weight management program . - Among obese woman significant depression , randomly assign 200 either 6-month standard behavior therapy weight management program combine cognitive-behavior therapy program focus depression weight management . - Complete follow assessment weight , depressive symptom , functional status three treatment group 12 month follow enrollment Screening follow-up data use address follow question : - Association depression obesity among middle-aged woman - Specific effect depression obesity functional status , disability , health service utilization - Impact depression participation outcome standardize weight management program - Benefit combined treatment ( focused depression weight management ) standardize behavioral therapy obese woman significant depressive symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiology Care Comorbid Obesity Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity significant grow public health concern , account approximately 300,000 excess death per year approximately 9 % US health care expenditures . Prevalence obesity steadily increase , estimate rate among middle-aged woman exceed 30 % . Obesity substantial impact medical morbidity health-related quality life . Public health approach prevention treatment obesity must consider substantial overlap depression . Some data suggest 50 % increase risk depression among obese woman . Women history depression depression treatment over-represented among seek obesity treatment . Current past depression also associate less success lose weight maintain weight loss . Because woman depressive disorder typically exclude clinical trial weight loss treatment , data management comorbid depression obesity limit . We propose two related study : A population-based epidemiologic study association obesity depression among woman longitudinal study obesity treatment among two cohort ( one comorbid obesity depression , one obesity ) identify epidemiologic study . Study 1 - Epidemiologic Study : A population-based sample approximately 6000 woman age 40-65 complete structure telephone assessment weight , nutrient intake , physical activity , depression , functional impairment , disability . Women Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 30 oversampled . Insurance claim data use measure health care cost . Aims epidemiologic study include : 1 . Examine association obesity depression among middle-aged woman . Secondary analysis examine possible mechanism association . 2 . Examine specific contribution obesity depression disability , functional impairment , health care utilization cost . Study 2 - Treatment study : A cohort approximately 100 woman obesity ( BMI &gt; 30 ) current depressive disorder enrol 6-month state-of-the-art group weight loss treatment . Approximately 200 woman comorbid obesity depression randomly assign either identical weight loss treatment combine cognitive-behavior group therapy program focus depression weight loss . Aims treatment study include : 1 . Examine effect depression success weight loss treatment compare weight loss , nutrient intake , physical activity depress non-depressed woman enrol identical weight loss program . Secondary analysis examine mechanism observe difference . 2 . Examine benefit combine weight loss/depression intervention weight loss treatment alone compare weight loss , nutrient intake , physical activity , depressive symptom , functional impairment , disability two group woman comorbid obesity depression randomly assign two different intervention program .</detailed_description>
