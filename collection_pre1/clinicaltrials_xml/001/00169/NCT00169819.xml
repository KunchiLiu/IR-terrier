	<brief_summary>HYPOTHESES - Discharge day uncomplicated trans-radial coronary artery stenting safe effective . - Hospitalized patient safely return refer center day follow trans-radial coronary artery stenting . - Abciximab give single bolus optimal trans-radial coronary artery stenting safe effective bolus + 12 hrs perfusion hamper early discharge . - Same-day discharge cost-effective increase patient satisfaction . OBJECTIVES AND END-POINTS The objective present study ass effectiveness safety day hospital discharge uncomplicated coronary artery stenting single bolus Abciximab use . The primary end-point study composite death , myocardial infarction , repeat hospitalization , urgent revascularization , severe thrombocytopenia , access site complication major bleeding 30 day follow stent implantation . The secondary end-point composite death , myocardial infarction , repeat target vessel revascularization 30 day , 6 month 1 year follow stent implantation . Other secondary end-points include total hospital stay ( day ) index procedure first 30 day follow-up , number unsolicited medical visit relation percutaneous procedure , index patient satisfaction direct indirect cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite significant improvement clinical result associate current use stenting pharmacologic agent little modification hospitalization duration percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . The main reason associate prolonged hospitalization PCI remain 1 ) fear abrupt vessel closure associate morbidity 2 ) need prolong bed rest case femoral approach even use device closure . The introduction coronary stent associate dramatic decrease vessel closure recognize stent deployment require high pressure balloon inflation increase antiplatelet therapy . Trans-radial coronary intervention appear safe cost-effective femoral PCI . However , current use IIb-IIIa inhibitor prohibit early discharge patient follow PCI pharmacology generally impose pursue drug infusion 18 24 hr follow PCI allow day discharge hospital . With Abciximab , however , pharmacologic data indicate prolonged platelet inhibition ( ≥ 80 % ) occur single bolus . Based EPIC trial result , recommend prolong platelet inhibition 12 hr perfusion . By analyze carefully EPIC trial result , hypothesize optimal stenting result , single bolus Abciximab would suffice . We aim demonstrate ( 1 ) trans-radial coronary stenting least 50 % entire population refer PCI could safely discharge hour observation ; ( 2 ) single bolus Abciximab least effective current recommend treatment bolus + 12 hrs perfusion uncomplicated stenting . This new regimen could significantly affect current practice , decrease hospital cost increase patient satisfaction PCI . STUDY DESIGN A prospective randomize single-center study compare day hospital discharge overnight hospitalization uncomplicated trans-radial coronary artery stenting . Out-patients randomize successful stent implantation day discharge remain hospitalized Laval Hospital next morning . Hospitalized patient randomize successful stent implantation either day discharge home overnight hospitalization ( either refer center Laval Hospital ) . All eligible patient treat Abciximab administer accord 2 different arm : For patient randomize same-day discharge , bolus Abciximab give , whereas remain patient , Abciximab give accord current practice i.e . bolus + 12 hrs perfusion . All patient eligible post-PCI enter registry .</detailed_description>
