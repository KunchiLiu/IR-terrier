	<detailed_description>Surgical therapy morbidly obese begin jejunocolic anastomosis procedure perform 1956 modified jejunoileal technique year later intolerable metabolic complication ensued.1 , 2 In 1969 , Payne recommend end side jejunal-ileal bypass ( JIB ) procedure preserve 37cm jejunum 10cm ileum replace jejunocolic bypass.2 In 1970 , Scott modify JIB increase length intestine use fashion end-to-end anastomosis jejunum ileum3 ; modify procedure soon become preferred procedure weight reduction . This foray bariatric surgery quickly embrace JIB widely adopt . However , mid late 1970 's , 10 year first JIB perform , concern develop regard long-term adverse effect anemia , vitamin deficiency , nephrolithiasis ultimately even renal liver failure.4-14 It number patient end organ failure full impact complication JIB recognize . Much complication stem malabsorptive component result JIB . As fat malabsorbed , fat-soluble vitamin calcium saponify . Subsequently , nutrient lose increased oxalate load deliver large intestine calcium would normally bind oxalate lose malabsorbed fat . In addition , bile salt normally reabsorb ileum deliver colon , increase permeability colonic mucosa oxalate . These factor result increase uptake oxalate large intestine . Oxalate , metabolize human , rapidly clear kidney result `` intestinal '' hyperoxaluria calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis4-6 , 12 , 15 nephrotoxicity.7 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 16 The probability severe renal complication JIB calculate 21 % 5 year increase 37 % 15 year ; also 28.7 % risk nephrolithiasis 15 years.13 It 1980 Food Drug Administration place moratorium JIB obesity surgery . Prior approximately 25,000 procedure perform United States . A large number patient JIB reverse succumbed complications.10 Those patient JIB intact remain risk complication cirrhosis , arthritis , urolithiasis , oxalate nephropathy , bypass enteritis—of latter three respond JIB reversed.10 The lesson learn previous experience bariatric surgical procedure must repeat . Although cardiopulmonary risk obesity significant , catastrophic long-term consequence unrecognized initially JIB forget . Many patient necessitated treatment kidney stone lose renal function require dialysis transplantation oxalate nephropathy.10 , 11 , 13 Currently , Roux-en-Y bariatric procedure ( REY ) widely utilized procedure surgical treatment obesity . REY result rapid weight loss17 compare restrictive procedures16 , 17 , 18-20 long-term effect malabsorptive component operation risk nephrolithiasis renal loss currently unknown . With REY , fat malabsorption one primary mechanism weight loss accomplish , therefore , intestinal hyperoxaluria , occur JIB , theoretically possible . Although long-term metabolic consequence REY yet study , recent data LithoLink concern . LithoLink Corporation , locate Chicago IL , clinical laboratory/disease management company provide test kidney stone patient . Physicians across United States refer stone patient LithoLink laboratory evaluation . Patients collect 24-hour urine sample home send via overnight air express LithoLink analysis . As part disease management service , medical history pertinent kidney stone obtain patient via phone interview . Since 1998 , patient specifically ask weight reduction surgery whether surgery JIB bariatric , answer cod database . The LithoLink database large kidney stone database link laboratory clinical data country , perhaps world . As part IRB approve research protocol , LithoLink seek ask question whether modern bariatric procedure associate increase urine oxalate excretion . They find normal non-stone forming control mean urinary oxalate excretion 34.3mg/day calcium oxalate stone former laboratory mean urinary oxalate excretion 37.3mg/day . In contrast , bariatric population , include gastric banding ( restrictive ) REY ( restrictive malabsorptive ) patient , find mean urinary oxalate excretion 78.4mg/day ( p &lt; 0.001 compare normal control stone former ) . Figure 1 show comparison urine oxalate excretion bariatric surgery patient routine stone former . Note significant right shift high oxalate excretion bariatric surgery patient ( open triangle ) . Most laboratory consider urinary oxalate excretion &gt; 45mg/day represent hyperoxaluria primary hyperoxaluria ( rare inborn error metabolism result marked endogenous production oxalate ) suspect level urinary oxalate exceed 100mg/day6 . Given definition , urine oxalate excretion patient undergone bariatric surgery striking . Nearly 3/4 bariatric surgery cohort urine oxalate level 45mg/day 1/4 urinary oxalate level excess 100mg/day . Calcium oxalate supersaturation ( Figure 2 ) , chemical drive force crystallization , also dramatically elevate bariatric surgery patient compare routine stone former ( 12.5 vs. 7.3 , p &lt; 0.001 ) , highlight extreme risk stone formation oxalate nephropathy patient . Finally , data analyze see increase number bariatric surgery patient refer kidney stone evaluation . Since number new patient refer Litholink year increase , data present number new bariatric surgery patient per one thousand new stone patient per year . As see Figure 3 , significant upward trend bariatric surgery patient kidney stone ( r2= 0.86 linear regression , p=0.01 ) . This rise bariatric surgery patient kidney stone parallel , lags several year , rise number bariatric surgery United States ( Figure 3 ) . Although bariatric procedure REY perform assumption resultant physiologic perturbation less severe JIB , preliminary data suggest contemporary bariatric surgical procedure result urinary oxalate level comparable report JIB well-known long-term adverse sequela vis-à-vis nephrolithiasis oxalate nephropathy . Because Clarian , well many medical institution , undertake large endeavor become center excellence bariatric surgical treatment , risk stone formation renal disease patient carefully examine . It hop early recognition adverse metabolic alteration allow patient physician rapidly treat even prevent complication . Loss renal function , previous experience JIB , much late phase consequence hyperoxaluria identification problem associate bariatric surgery . Patients also adequately counseled prior history stone disease regard relative risk various bariatric surgical procedure . As obesity currently important national health issue , examination surgical treatment obesity consequence procedures timely . Scrutiny risk bariatric surgery benefit patient surgeon identify prevent renal complication may arise .</detailed_description>
