	<brief_title>Hs-CRP Clinical Marker Inflammatory Atherogenic Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) major cause death develop world . Cholesterol screen use tool identify individual increase risk develop future coronary event , almost one-half patient develop myocardial infarction either normal moderately increase serum cholesterol concentration . In last year , experimental clinical evidence demonstrate atherosclerosis simply disease lipid deposit . Rather , grow recognition CHD inflammatory component play critical role arterial plaque rupture trigger episode coronary thrombosis . In last year , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , exquisitely sensitive marker systemic inflammation , emerge powerful predictor cardiovascular disease , particular CHD , beyond estimate traditional risk factor . The availability high-sensitivity ( h ) CRP assay enable detection even low-grade inflammatory response previously regard clinically meaningful . However , hs-CRP make transition epidemiological clinical research routine clinical setting , several important issue must satisfactorily address . Therefore , overall objective proposal study applicability hs-CRP assay assessment CV risk daily clinical condition hyperlipidemic population without CHD currently evaluate evaluate hs-CRP response statin .</detailed_description>
