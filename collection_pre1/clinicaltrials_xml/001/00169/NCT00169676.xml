	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer second lead cause cancer death men today . An estimated 220,900 new case diagnose 2003 accord American Cancer Society.7 Prostate cancer account one-third new cancer diagnose men 2003 . Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) , sensitive screening method prostate cancer , help diagnose prostate cancer earlier stage . Stamey et al . find diagnosis prostate cancer patient T1c disease ( abnormality digital rectal examination elevate PSA ) increase from10 % 1988 73 % 1996 increase organ confine cancer increase 40 % 75 % time period.8 Current surgical option organ confine prostate cancer include open radical retropubic prostatectomy , open radical perineal prostatectomy , radioactive seed implantation , radiation therapy . Open radical retropubic prostatectomy pioneer 1947 Millin slow gain widespread acceptance secondary associate morbidity.9-13 Refinement retropubic approach Walsh greatly improve outcome , make common surgical approach radical prostatectomy.14 , 15 As procedure , interest laparoscopic approach radical prostatectomy develop hope minimize patient morbidity . In 1992 , Schuessler et al perform first LRP technical difficulty procedure time prohibit widespread application technique.16 In 1998 , Guillonneau et al introduced Mountsouris technique transperitoneal approach use perform LRP.17 , 18 Other group use approach even adapt technique perform extraperitoneal approach LRP.1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 19 , 20 Many center currently offer LRP primary therapy organ confine prostate cancer . All curative surgical therapy prostate cancer , whether perform open laparoscopic manner , result impotence and/or incontinence . Incontinence treat simple measure , muscle strengthening exercise , bothersome , treat surgical therapy . Impotence treat medication , need , surgery . The relative risk positive surgical margin patient undergo open radical retropubic prostatectomy compare laparoscopic radical prostatectomy know . Preliminary publication regard laparoscopic radical prostatectomy report rate positive surgical margin ( 13-25 % ) similar open radical prostatectomy ( 11-46 % ) .2 , 5 , 6 , 19 , 21-28 However , long-term follow-up available patient undergo laparoscopic radical prostatectomy , impact positive margin long-term survival know .</detailed_description>
