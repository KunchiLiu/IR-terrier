	<brief_summary>Patients large otherwise complex renal calculus commonly treat percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PNL ; PERC ) . PERC require creation approximately 10 mm channel renal parenchyma , intra-renal collecting system , order effect stone fragmentation extraction . Although nephrostomy tract confine small fraction renal parenchyma ( approximately 1 % ) , trauma associate creation tract affect blood flow oxygen delivery region beyond immediate site injury . It possible could result significant functional renal impairment . There several report describe effect PERC renal function , interpretation study difficult , due lack uniformity patient selection variability time peri-operative evaluation . Recent data investigator ' lab , obtain porcine model , suggest , acutely , PERC cause significant decrease renal function measure para amino hippurate ( PAH ) clearance . The purpose study determine , rigorous standardized fashion , acute effect PERC renal function , measure nuclear renography .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renogram Study With Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy ( PERC ) : Alterations Renal Blood Flow Consequence PERC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PERC commonly use technique treat patient harbor large complex renal calculus . PERC particularly effective procedure , associate complication . However , effect PERC renal functional parameter well define . The effect PERC renal function examine animal model several group . In one porcine model , baseline renal function , define PAH creatinine clearance , compare measure one month post-procedure . No acute data record , author note although significant change renal function one month follow-up point , significant amount renal scarring present . This finding significant renal scarring follow PERC animal model corroborate others . One group study canine model , detect significant diminution renal function ( defined creatinine clearance ) 48 hour follow PERC , 6 week follow PERC renal function return normal . In human subject undergo PERC , percutaneous tract also associate renal scarring . These study , retrospective case series , capture strictly define measure renal function , creatinine clearance , rather compare pre- post-procedure serum creatinine surrogate renal function . No significant change serum creatinine identify either study , blood collection perform variable time , uncontrolled setting . Nuclear renography image technique record renal functional parameter . There one report nuclear renographic assessment effect PERC renal function . This report uncontrolled study , renograms perform median 22 day post-procedure . At time interval , possible derive conclusion regard acute effect PERC renal function . The investigator recently demonstrate porcine model PERC associate acutely significant deleterious effect renal function . Following routine PERC , glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) renal plasma flow ( RPF ) decline 50 % treat untreated kidney return normal measure 72 &amp; 74 hour ( n=3 pig ) . Sodium excretion , however , markedly baseline 72 74 hour 2 3 pig . PAH extraction , measure efficiency renal tubular secretion organic anion , average 43.5 ± 9.7 % 42.6 ± 14.1 % 72 74 hour 3 pig . These value substantially baseline value 80.4 ± 4.0 % measure sham-PNL pig . To date , examination effect PERC renal function restrict gross measure function define serum creatinine , radionuclide study perform sub-acute interval follow PNL , often without differential measurement control . Importantly , investigator ' recent study porcine model demonstrate PERC may cause significant alteration renal function . There need define rigorous fashion effect PERC renal blood flow renal function . If deleterious effect identify , future effort focus minimize insult .</detailed_description>
