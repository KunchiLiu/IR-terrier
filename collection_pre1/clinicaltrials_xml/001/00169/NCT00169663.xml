	<brief_title>Brushite Kidney Stones : A Registry Database Clinical Laboratory Findings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple treatment option available treatment kidney ureteral calculus . Treatment option include shock wave lithotripsy ( SWL ; shock wave transmit body wall focus onto stone break stone gravel ) , percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PNL ; small flank incision make telescope inserted kidney allow stone fragmentation removal patient ) , ureteroscopic lithotripsy ( URS ; small telescope insert ureter kidney laser use break stone gravel ) . Brushite unique form calcium phosphate kidney stone often sub-optimal stone fragmentation shock wave lithotripsy ( Heimbach et al , 1999 ) . Due SWL resistance , brushite patient often undergo invasive treatment URS PNL achieve stone free status . Brushite patient often multiple stone high likelihood develop recurrence ( new stone formation regrowth exist stone fragment ) , often within first year surgery . These patient may also history anatomical abnormality urinary tract history prior renal ureteral surgery ( Klee et al , 1991 ) . A thorough review clinical , radiological metabolic data brushite patient potential clarify number important point . Many patient brushite stone often history non-brushite stone ( e.g . calcium oxalate ) predating development brushite stone historical review need define factor contribute shift stone composition . In addition , show CT attenuation value use predict stone composition ( Joseph et al , 2002 ) . As result , crucial review radiologic appearance know brushite stone identify specific radiographic characteristic possibly allow radiographic diagnosis brushite establish . Finally , little information report urinary abnormality brushite patient . By carefully examine 24 hour urine data large population brushite patient , information may identify use provide improved management specific abnormality prevent stone recurrence .</detailed_description>
