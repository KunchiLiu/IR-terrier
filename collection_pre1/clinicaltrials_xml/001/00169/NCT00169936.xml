	<detailed_description>Heart transplantation advantageous procedure select patient end-stage heart failure . Graft rejection remain major factor limit long-term survival despite continued advancement scientific skill immunosuppression . Hyperacute rejection occur rarely since screen recipient anti-donor antibody introduce . Focal diffuse acute cellular rejection diagnose endomyocardial biopsy ( EMB ) . Coronary angiography ( CA ) use monitor allograft arteriopathy , also describe chronic rejection . Repeated endomyocardial biopsy ( EMB ) remain surveillance method available . Endomyocardial biopsy expensive , invasive , inconvenient patient , associate significant incidence serious complication . The MCG device invention may provide sensitive objective mean assess alteration heart tissue . Because acute inflammatory process rejection deleteriously affect myocyte structure function , hypothesize either de- re-polarization change occur cardiac cycle subsequent change cardiac magnetic field may give altered reading affect patient time .</detailed_description>
