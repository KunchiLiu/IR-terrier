	<brief_title>The Efficacy Cognitive-Behavioural Intervention Deliberate Self-Harm Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . The development treatment intervention non-fatal deliberate self-harm ( DSH ) among young people receive little attention scientific literature mental health care . This surprising , consider relatively high rate hospital-referred DSH among adolescent report epidemiological study ( Arensman et al. , 1995 ; Hawton et al. , 1997 ; Hawton et al. , 1998 ; Schmidtke et al. , 1996 ) . On basis four-year monitoring study ( 1989-1992 ) area Leiden , average rate DSH among female age 15-24 179 per 100,000 male age group average rate 91 per 100,000 ( Arensman et al. , 1995 ) . General population survey among adolescent show self-reported life-time prevalence 2 5 percent ( Kienhorst et al. , 1990 ; De Wilde et al. , 2000 ) . Reports European country indicate increase DSH adolescent young adult ( 15-30 year ) , particular young male ( Hawton et al. , 1997 ; Schmidtke et al. , 1996 ) . DSH operationalized dysfunctional behaviour associate heterogeneity psychological psychiatric disorder e.g. , affective disorder , anxiety disorder , substance abuse , eat disorder ( Arensman &amp; Kerkhof , 1996 ; Arensman , 1997 ; Ellis et al. , 1996 ; Engstroem et al. , 1996 ; Kienhorst et al. , 1993 ) . However , common find depressive symptom ( observer- self-rated ) major depression appear highly prevalent among young DSH patient ( Burgess et al. , 1998 ; Goldston et al. , 1998 ; Harrington et al. , 1994 ) . In study , co-morbidity type psychopathology also appear relatively high . The risk repeat DSH high first year follow episode DSH . The repetition rate among young DSH patient vary 10 % ( Goldacre &amp; Hawton , 1985 ) 27 % ( Arensman , 1997 ) hospital refer DSH patient . Among DSH patient , prevention first subsequent repeat episode DSH important order prevent pattern chronic repetition . Research find regard risk factor associate repeated DSH fairly consistent . Among young DSH patient , increase risk repeat DSH characterise suicidal ideation , depression ( Harrington et al. , 2000 ; Hawton et al. , 1999 ) , hopelessness ( Brent , 1987 ; Hawton et al. , 1999 ) , impulsivity ( Kashden et al. , 1993 ) , disturbance autobiographical memory ( Evans et al. , 1992 ) , problem peer relationship , frequent chronic stress problem-solving deficit ( De Wilde et al. , 2000 ; Hawton et al. , press ; Rudd et al. , 1998 ) . Despite fact many study report correlate , available treatment study , merely comprise evaluation general treatment intervention , often without randomise controlled design , incorporate knowledge risk factor ( Hawton et al. , 1998 ) . In addition , exist explanatory treatment model address heterogeneity group DSH patient . This surprising , consider variety characteristic problem DSH patient . So far , model focus single psychiatric problem , depression anxiety disorder . The aim study present test therapeutic approach DSH go beyond single psychiatric diagnosis address heterogeneity DSH patient . It combine element cognitive-behavioural therapy , problem-solving intervention Dialectical Behaviour Therapy ( DBT ) , since approach fit needs different DSH patient . Patients depressive thought belief predominate may especially profit element cognitive therapy , patient primarily experience problem regulate emotion may especially profit element DBT . Patients skills deficit predominate may especially profit element problem solve intervention . In addition combine treatment approach , attention give specific developmental issue play role among adolescent DSH patient . Furthermore , knowledge risk factor ( repetition ) DSH incorporate treatment . The model aetiology maintenance DSH treatment protocol base address interaction cognitive , affective , behavioural interpersonal aspect DSH . As stress-process model , relationship vulnerability factor ( negative family experience biological characteristic ) , trigger factor , DSH mediate moderate variable ( interpersonal problems/lack social support individual characteristic : cognitive distortion , affective dysregulation skill deficit ) mediate variable ( negative appraisal , inadequate cop psychological reaction impulsivity ) . In accordance Van Praag ( 1996 ) , assume person marginally function serotonergic-system experience stressful event able cope , production stress-hormone cortisol increase , decrease level serotonin . Reduced serotonin activity prefrontal cortex examine neuroimaging technique , may involve destabilisation regulation fear , aggression ( Van Praag , 1996 ) impulsivity ( Mann , 1999 ) , since area brain mediate behavioural inhibition . Increased impulsivity may therefore increase risk DSH ( Van Heeringen , 2001 ) . We assume patient impulsivity carelessness primary feature associate DSH . In particular , impulsivity feeling hopelessness co-occur , risk DSH appear high . The recognition association hopelessness DSH , describe , line cognitive approach Williams ( 2002 ) state time , among people perceive change stressful situation , despair gradually gain upper hand show mark symptom depression hopelessness particular.The approach outline u , advantage compare approach base single psychiatric problem , since combine main biological , cognitive , affective , behavioural interpersonal aspect DSH . 2 . The wide range problem face young people harm call variety different treatment strategy , vary intensive care high risk suicide , brief intervention group patient DSH appear transient response temporary difficulty problem ( Harrington , 2001 ) . One important obstacle treat DSH patient may play role almost every treatment compliance ( Heard , 2000 : Hawton Van Heeringen ) . Another obstacle treat DSH patient limited availability research data effectiveness therapy DSH , especially randomise control trial . In section follow common treatment approach DSH discuss . Attention give known effectiveness term reduction repeat episode DSH . Cognitive therapy DSH patient generally focus tendency evaluate event presence future way result feel entrapped ( difficulty cop ) hopelessness ( great difficulty generate positive future event ) ( Heard , 2000 : Hawton van Heeringen ) . Cognitive cognitive behavioural therapy direct cognitive restructuring seem promise successfully treat patient harm deliberately ( Hawton et al. , 1998 ) .Given problem-solving deficit appear relate increased risk self-harm ( Orbach et al. , 1990 ) , commonly use technique old adolescent brief problem orient counselling , form cognitive therapy . While problem-solving therapy seem promise improve depression , hopelessness problem-solving skill ( Towsend et al. , 2001 ) , still unclear whether problem-solving therapy help address current problem also longstanding deficiency problem-solving skill . Current research focus almost exclusively solve real hypothetical problem relationships people , yet one major issue suicidal patient solve problem gain control feeling . Linehan ( 1993a , 1993b ) develop intensive treatment programme patient borderline personality disorder , call Dialectical Behaviour Therapy ( DBT ) . This treatment method focus teach skill help people regulate emotion stress acceptance pain crisis . In review Heard ( 2000 : Hawton van Heeringen ) , general , decrease repeat DSH find among patient DBT treatment . Group therapy seem promising treatment adolescent repeatedly harm . However , large study require assess accurately efficacy intervention ( Wood , Trainor , Rothwell , Moore , Harrington , 2001 ) . No consensus treat DSH medically reach yet . As psychological treatment , study efficacy psychopharmacological treatment small detect significant effect . So far , appear promise treatment high dos Serotonin Specific Reuptake Inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , , select case atypical neuroleptic . SSRIs probably first line medical treatment ( Kavoussi et al. , 1994 ) . Tricyclics seem effective child adolescent depression toxic overdose ( Harrington , 2001 ) . In conclusion , say still remain considerable uncertainty type psychosocial medical treatment DSH patient effective , inclusion insufficient number patient trial main limiting factor . However , cognitive-behavioural therapy problem-solving therapy DBT seem promise . The present study incorporate element cognitive-behavioural therapy , problem-solving intervention DBT . 3 . Study design . The subject randomly allocate cognitive-behavioural intervention ( experimental group ) routine aftercare ( control group ) , stratify respect repetition DSH gender.The study subject patient age 15-35 referred Leiden University Medical Center , MCH Westeinde ( The Hague ) , local center mental healthcare Leiden ( Rivierduinen ) The Hague ( Parnassia PMC ) , follow act DSH .
