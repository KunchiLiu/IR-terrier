	<brief_summary>Attempts understand relationship malaria transmission intensity antimalarial drug resistance rest mainly mathematical model . To date , except two study report reduction prevalence drug resistance Tanzania Zimbabwe , field data address impact reduce malaria transmission use vector control measure antimalarial drug resistance . Thus whether vector control decrease increase drug resistance remain contentious issue . The aim study investigate impact insecticide-treated curtain ( ITCs ) clinical parasitological outcome child uncomplicated malaria treat chloroquine ( CQ ) , prevalence genetic marker resistance CQ sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) ability child clear drug resistant parasite . The therapeutic efficacy CQ study 9 village use ITCs 6-8 year 9 village history ITC use . A cross-sectional survey also conduct estimate prevalence genetic marker resistance CQ SP asymptomatic child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Background Drug resistance associate increase number hospital admission , increase case clinical malaria malaria-specific mortality . Several strategy propose mean spread antimalarial drug resistance could delay . These strategy include reduce drug pressure , improve quality drug use , use combination antimalarial drug use vector control measure . Restricting use drug reduce drug pressure presently unrealistic due poor access health facility lack equipment . Improving quality use antimalarial use pre-packaged dos , education train sound control strategy . However , impact strategy drug resistance yet evaluate . Another promising approach contain drug resistance use combination therapy . The successful combination far use artemisinin derivative . It likely implement combination therapy resource limited country hamper high cost . Given impact reduce malaria transmission , case clinical malaria all-cause malaria mortality , insecticide-treated material ( ITMs ) recently propose potential tool delay development spread drug resistance . So far , debate interaction malaria transmission intensity drug resistance driven analytical model , knowledge , 2 field study yet address impact ITMs antimalarial drug resistance . If ITMs reduce development spread antimalarial drug resistance , would enhance usefulness malaria control tool . This study examine impact insecticide-treated curtain ( ITC ) use 6-8 year prevalence antimalarial drug resistance Burkina Faso . 2 . Objectives 2.1 Primary objective - To determine frequency vivo clinical parasitological failure follow treatment uncomplicated malaria CQ child live village protect protected insecticide treat curtain ( ITC ) . - To determine child ITC non-ITC village clinical malaria differ ability clear genetically resistant parasite treatment CQ . 2.2 Secondary objective - To determine proportion child infect parasite carry pfcrt-76T pfmdr1-86Y allele associate resistance CQ village protect protected ITC . - To determine proportion child infect parasite carry parasite dihydrofolate reductase ( dhfr ) dihydropteroate synthetase ( dhps ) alleles associate resistant SP ITC non- ITC protect village . - To relate vivo clinical parasitological failure rate presence genotypic marker resistance CQ estimate genotype-failure index ( GFIs ) genotype-resistance index ( GRIs ) . 3 . Methods 3.1 Field work Passive case detection use recruit child age 6-59 month uncomplicated malaria use slightly modify version standard WHO vivo method assess therapeutic efficacy anti-malarial drug .Children seek care select health centre screen eligibility join study , enrol follow 14 day . If child 's axillary temperature &gt; =37.5 ºC obvious cause fever malaria find clinical examination , 500 ml blood draw micro-container contain EDTA . Microscopic diagnosis malaria measurement packed-cell volume ( PCV ) perform immediately sample receive laboratory . After enrolment , clinical examination perform day 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 . In addition , caretaker advise bring child back health centre time day 1 day 14 child 's condition improve . Thick thin blood film filter paper blood spot prepare day 0 , 3 , 7 , 14 unscheduled visit . Treatment child treatment outcome A standard treatment CQ administer child uncomplicated malaria . The treatment dose 25 mg/kg body weight CQ 3 day ; 10 mg/kg day 0 , 1 5 mg/kg day 2 . Treatment administer clinic supervision nurse . Outcomes vivo trial classify accord WHO clinical parasitological assessment system Prevalence pfcrt-76 pfmdr1-86 mutation community A cross-sectional survey conduct estimate prevalence pfcrt-76 pfmdr1-86 mutation asymptomatic child . Random sample child age 6 59 month child age 5 year 14 year select per village . Thick thin blood film filter paper blood spot prepare finger-prick . Estimation entomological inoculation rate A cross-sectional survey conduct peak period malaria transmission ( September 2002 ) estimation EIR . Catches perform use CDC light trap . An ELISA test use detect presence P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein ( CSP ) . Socio-economic health seek behaviour survey In 2003 , survey perform random sample 20 compound village collect data health seek behaviour , socio-economic demographic feature study population include frequency population movement village . 3.2 Laboratory method Thick thin blood film stain Giemsa stain ( 3 % ) 45 minute . Asexual parasite gametocyte P. falciparum count 400 white blood cell . For molecular biology analysis , DNA extract pre , post-treatment cross-sectional survey filter paper blood spot use chelex . DNA amplify nested PCR detect mutation pfcrt-76 . Nest 2 PCR product digest Apo I endonuclease restriction enzyme electrophoresed onto 3 % agarose . Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe ( SSOP ) perform detect presence pfmdr1-86 mutation . Mutations dhfr ( 51 , 59 108 ) dhps ( 437 540 ) also detect SSOP . MSP2 gene polymorphism study PCR differentiate recrudescence new infection . 3.3 Sample size power With 18 community ( 9 per group ) , study would 80 % power detect , 5 % significance level , 50 % decrease clinical failure rate eligible child . This number community would also permit detection 40 % decrease parasitological failure rate eligible child power , least 60 % 40 % increase clinical parasitological failure rate , 5 % significance level , child carry parasite CQ resistant genotype CQ treatment start . 3.4 Data processing analysis Two data clerk independently enter data onto computer use EPIINFO version 6.0 . Analyses perform use STATA ( Release 8.2 , www.stata.com ) . The study main endpoint examine use Generalized Estimating Equations regression model 3.5 Community approval This obtained meeting community leader explain objective study involve . In addition community consent , individual sign informed consent obtain caretaker child enrolment .</detailed_description>
