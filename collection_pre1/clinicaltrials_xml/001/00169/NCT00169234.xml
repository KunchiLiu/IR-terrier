	<brief_title>Pneumococcal Adult-dose Ranging Immunization Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose prospective randomize study ass safety , post-vaccination antibody response , memory response subsequent polysaccharide challenge vary dos PCV7 compare standard dose PPV23 immunocompetent adult 70-79 year age previously vaccinate PPV23 age 65 year least 5 year previously . The study conduct among total 220 person recruit GHC Seattle VAMC . Participants randomize one 5 study group 44 participant per group . The antigen content PCV7 vary administration different volume license pediatric formulation vaccine . Four group receive one four volume ( 0.1 mL , 0.5 mL , 1.0 mL , 2.0 mL ) license pediatric formulation PCV7 follow 12 month later administration challenge 0.1 mL dose PPV23 ass induction immunologic memory . The comparison group receive standard 0.5 mL dose PPV23 follow 12 month later administration 0.1 mL dose PPV23 .</detailed_description>
