	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial assess efficacy montelukast treatment adult ≥50 year age persistent asthma and/or COPD . Primary outcome include forced expiratory volume one-second ( FEV1 ) daytime asthma symptom score . Nocturnal symptom , asthma control , health-related quality life , peak flow measurement , health care utilization also assess secondary outcome . Participants recruit Kaiser Permanente Northwest member population . One hundred forty-nine subject randomize treatment montelukast ( 10 mg per day ) placebo , follow six-week period . No difference lung function measure , health-related quality life , health care utilization , asthma symptom score observe ; however , montelukast group slightly improve asthma control score compare placebo group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Montelukast Sodium ( Singulair ) Older Adults With Asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma COPD common chronic condition older adult . Adherence therapy important consideration since patient typically take two medication day often difficulties inhaled breathing medication . Therefore , oral preparation , leukotriene modifier , considerable appeal old adult asthma COPD . Phase 3 primary study leukotriene modifier , montelukast sodium ( Singulair ) , management asthma include old adult . The following randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study design pilot study evaluate efficacy montelukast , addition usual therapy , treatment old adult asthma and/or COPD . Primary outcomes include pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume one-second ( FEV1 ) average daytime asthma symptom score . Participants recruit Kaiser Permanente Northwest ( KPNW ) , HMO 450,000 member Portland , OR . All adult ≥50 year age asthma and/or COPD symptomatic despite use daily breathe medication . They screen phone collect information asthma symptom , medication , health care utilization , co-morbid illness . Eligible person attend baseline visit ass eligibility collect baseline data , include smoking status , co-morbidities , participant demographic . Spirometry perform twenty minute administration four puff inhale albuterol deliver meter dose inhaler . All participant receive instruction use peak flow meter ; maintenance daily asthma diary peak flow measurement , symptom , medication ; optimal use MDI spacer . Participants complete two-week run-in period placebo pill use diary record peak flow morning , use inhale ß-agonist , nocturnal awakening asthma , occurrence asthma attack . A total 149 participant randomize receive either montelukast ( one 10 mg tablet/day ) ( N=71 ) placebo ( one tablet/day ) ( N=78 ) . Spirometry repeat randomization visit , information health status , asthma quality life , asthma control collect . Participants follow 6 week randomization . A telephone call make three-weeks collect information adverse experience . At final visit , participant complete spirometry , answered question health status , asthma QOL asthma control . Unscheduled health care visit asthma six-week study period note . Results show improvement asthma control mixed . A small improvement montelukast group see use one two control measure . There difference lung function , asthma symptom score , health care utilization , health-related quality life treatment control group .</detailed_description>
