	<brief_title>Monitoring Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy HIV-infected Parents Thailand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Implementation highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) lead substantial decrease HIV-related mortality morbidity . Current guideline emphasize maximal durable viral load suppression . However , goal therapy restoration immunity , treatment failure usually define inability maintain undetectable viral load , without regard immune function . This situation often lead rapid sequence therapeutic switch , thus narrow therapeutic option time . A monitoring strategy drive primarily patient 's immune restoration would likely effective prevent disease progression , would lead few change HAART regimen would considerably simpler cost effective . Subjects randomly assign one two switch strategy : - VL-S , standard viral load ( VL ) base monitoring strategy , switch perform VL confirm ( within one month ) 400 copy per mL . - CD4-S , alternative CD4 base monitoring strategy switch perform confirm ( within one month ) relative decline CD4 count 30 % peak value observe within 200 cell baseline . The initial HAART regimen NNRTI+NRTI contain regimen second line regimen PI contain regimen , subsequent regimen choose individually base tolerance , previous drug use , resistance profile , drug available . Patients follow end study ( maximum 5 year first enrollee , three year last enrollee ) .</detailed_description>
