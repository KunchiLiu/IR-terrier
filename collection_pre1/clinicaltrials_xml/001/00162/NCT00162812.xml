	<brief_title>Topoisomerase II Alpha Gene Amplification Protein Overexpression Predicting Efficacy Epirubicin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical evaluation topo II predictive marker : Preliminary result clinical study suggest complete remission treatment anthracyclines advance breast cancer observe case topo II gene amplification ( 7 complete remission , patient topo II gene amplify tumor , complete remission patient normal delete topo II gene ) . Moreover , group analyze predictive value topo II population node-positive breast cancer patient randomly treat either anthracyclines CMF ( Belgian cooperative trial ) . In first study , topo II evaluate immunohistochemistry , allow detection topo II protein expression . The result study suggested patient derive high benefit anthracyclines topo II protein immunostained 10 % tumor cell . The main finding study see hypothesis-generating limited number patient evaluate ( fifty study arm ) topo II protein level depend gene amplification well tumor proliferation rate . Therefore , topo II protein expression necessarily reflect topo II gene status . The second study run group base series patient evaluate first study , , time , HER-2 topo II gene evaluate fluorescence in-situ hybridization ( FISH ) , allow detection gene aberration . The main finding second study quite consistent pre-clinical data suggest HER-2 amplified/topo II amplify tumour show great sensitivity anthracyclines efficacy agent HER-2 amplified/topo II non-amplified tumor comparable efficacy drug regimens like CMF . Nevertheless , although result report study bring additional support hypothesis topo II marker predict efficacy anthracyclines , definitive conclusion draw fairly limited number patient evaluate , retrospective nature analysis . The present study protocol : Supported `` in-vitro '' preliminary `` in-vivo '' data , briefly summarize , study design test prospectively value topo II alpha gene amplification protein overexpression predict efficacy anthracyclines . To knowledge prospective trial worldwide attempt prospectively clarify predictive value interest biological marker . This study could important practical implication daily clinical management early breast cancer patient , trial confirms topo II gene amplification and/or protein overexpression associate high efficacy anthracyclines , topo II normal/deleted gene low protein content associate modest efficacy , important step forward direction anthracycline `` tailoring '' would accomplish . The practical advantage approach would use anthracyclines primarily patient suppose derive large benefit , thus spar long-term anthracycline-related toxicity ( i.e . secondary acute myeloid leukemia , cardiac dysfunction , amenorrhea/sterility case fertile woman ) patient significant gain antitumor activity anticipate . To reach ambitious aim , early breast cancer patient tumor least 2 cm ( define breast ultrasound ) evaluate topo II gene protein expression . For purpose , pre-treatment biopsy ( tru-cut ) perform topo II gene evaluate fixed sample FISH . The use triple probe allow concomitant evaluation HER-2 gene status . Topo II protein evaluate immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Afterwards , patient , independently topo II gene protein status , treat single-agent epirubicin Eligibility criterion allow participation patient use anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy would probably propose breast cancer surgery , mainly estrogen receptor ( ER ) negativity . Therefore , overtreatment anthracyclines occur group patient . Pathological complete response ( pCR ) epirubicin correlate topo II gene protein status . The study two biological hypothesis , one subgroup patient ER negative/HER-2 amplified tumor , one subgroup patient ER negative/HER-2 non amplify tumor . 1. st hypothesis : Patients ER negative/HER-2 amplified tumor : In subgroup patient , topo II gene amplify 40 % case . We hypothesize topo II amplify tumor three-fold increase pCR rate observe , opposed pCR rate tumor topo II normal delete gene . 2. nd hypothesis : Patients ER negative/HER-2 non amplify tumor : In subset patient , almost topo II gene aberration find base previous data discuss . However , recent data report C. Sotiriou et al use cDNA microarrays , suggest subset ER-negative HER-2 negative tumor , also define basal-like subset , two distinct subgroup identify ( i.e . basal-like 1 2 ) . While basal-like 1 tumor show high proliferation rate high level topo II RNA , basal-like 2 tumor moderate-low proliferation rate normal level topo II RNA . We hypothesize topo II RNA overexpression basal-like 1 tumor related topo II gene amplification concomitant HER-2 gene amplification report subset tumor . The second study hypothesis ER negative/HER-2 non amplify tumor topo II protein overexpression , 2.5 fold increase pCR rate observe , opposed pCR rate tumor low topo II protein content . A tumor sample drawn time pre-treatment biopsy frozen use perform oligonucleotide base microarrays ( Affymetrix ) . This technique allow evaluation thousand gene ultimately provide u tumor genetic profile . Homogeneous genetic profile ( genetic cluster ) might identify , correlate efficacy single-agent epirubicin . This correlation allow u address secondary end-point study , identification gene eventually genetic profile play role determination sensitivity anthracyclines . Among gene could interfere sensitivity anthracyclines , p-53 seem deserve special attention . Indeed , `` in-vitro '' data suggest least p-53 mutated tumor poorly sensitive anthracyclines , primarily anthracycline-induced apoptosis prevent . Interestingly , p-53 mutate tumor display frequently HER-2 gene amplification therefore topo II gene amplification ( 23 ) . Accordingly , p-53 mutation could hamper response anthracyclines even tumor carry topo II gene amplification . This hypothesis also explore present study , p-53 mutation evaluate DNA sequencing , efficacy epirubicin topo II amplify non-amplified tumor correlate p-53 status . Additionally , patient inflammatory breast cancer treat dense administration epirubicin ( 100 mg/m2/2 week ) . We keep drug early breast cancer use slightly aggressive regimen higher dose-density . The feasibility administration epirubicin 100 mg/m2 every two week granulocyte-growth factor support show neoadjuvant , metastatic adjuvant setting acceptable toxicity . This neoadjuvant epirubicin regimen may complete adjuvant chemotherapy , taxane-based regimen , since sequential approach ( anthracyclines taxanes ) suggest superior anthracyclines regimen LABC .</detailed_description>
