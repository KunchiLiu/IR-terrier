	<brief_summary>Mother severe Iodine deficiency likely neonates poor mental development . In order select population could benefit iodine supplementation , ioduria test routinely practise . Strong background data suggest iodine status could antenatally correlate foetal thyroid volume . The aim study examine correlation two parameter population 130 healthy pregnant woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relation Between Maternal Iodine Status Prenatal Foetal Thyroid Dimension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iodine essential element thyroid homeostasis , particularly pregnant woman fetus . Various study clearly show antenatal thyroid disorder mother fetus could cause extreme situation neurological consequence . At broad scale , subtle alteration thyroid hormone balance implicate developmental delay deviation IQ bell curve newborn infant mother elevate TSH . The clinical implication basic data public health yet confirm . It clearly establish moderate iodine deficiency France decrease gradient west east . In Ile de France , moderate iodine deficiency , lead team propose systematic supplementation woman iodine . One way target woman really need supplement systematic determination urinary iodine tongue ; assay reliable difficult implement ad hoc practice individual level . Our team expertise field fetal thyroid , particularly sonographic reference curve perimeter diameter thyroid clearly establish reliably . Knowing iodine deficiency cause decline maternal urine iodine phenomenon goitrigénèse biological hypothyroidism study show neonatal thyroid volume higher iodine deficient mother . We postulate measurement fetal thyroid criterion correlate maternal urinary iodine . If case , simple test identify iodine supplementation pregnant woman .</detailed_description>
