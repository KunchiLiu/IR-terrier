	<brief_summary>The role play ß2AR polymorphism determine bronchial response ß2AR agonist drug , confirm several study . The purpose present study examine possible causal relationship genetically base alteration structure ß2AR drug responsiveness . An ex-vivo model ( organ bath technique ) use investigate association polymorphism cod region ß2AR response bronchial ring derive human lung tissue respective agonist ( i.e . salbutamol ) . In second part study bronchial ring incubate 24 hour solution contain fix concentration albuterol . A second dose response curve rise concentration albuterol construct relationship β2 genetic polymorphism extent desensitization albuterol investigate . In addition , specifically design receptor bind assay bronchial tissue use define affinity ( Kd ) expression ( Vmax ) ß2 receptor . These data enable enhance understand regard mechanism responsible association note ß2AR polymorphism alter drug effect .</brief_summary>
