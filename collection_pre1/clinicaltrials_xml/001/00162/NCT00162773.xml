	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic inflammatory disease low airway . The inflammatory process associate change airway hyperresponsiveness ( irritability ) , airflow limitation cause bronchoconstriction , edema , mucous plugging . Mast cell , basophil , eosinophil , activate T-lymphocytes , macrophage , neutrophil , airway epithelial cell play role inflammatory process release mediator directly responsible local inflammation release mediator encourage influx inflammatory cell ( Expert Panel Report 2 , 1997 ) . These cell product eventually produce state chronic allergic inflammation lead increase vascular leakage , mucous secretion , smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness , nerve activation . Clinically , process characterize intermittent shortness breath , wheeze , cough , chest tightness . Although asthmatic atopic ( allergic ) , non-atopic asthmatic exist develop equally severe disease . Non-allergic asthmatic trend towards high normal level allergic antibody ( IgE ) though obviously lack skin test specificity . When examine skin test reactivity serum IgE independent variable asthma risk , strong association serum IgE elevation skin test reactivity . In fact , serum IgE tend high asthmatic regardless skin test reactivity . Omalizumab ( Xolair® ) recombinant humanize monoclonal antibody bind specifically ( FceRI ) bind site human IgE . The binding omalizumab inhibits ability IgE bind basophil mast cell . Omalizumab recently receive FDA approval treatment moderate severe persistent allergic asthma pediatric ( 12 year age ) adult patient . The addition omalizumab standard asthma therapy find reduce asthma exacerbation decrease inhale corticosteroid dose rescue medication use . ( Busse , 2001 ) . In phase III double blind placebo control trial involve 525 severe allergic asthmatic , omalizumab treat patient few exacerbation steroid stable phase steroid reduction phase placebo control ( Busse , 2001 ) . The median reduction steroid dose reduction phase 75 % 50 % omalizumab placebo group respectively . In similarly design steroid reduction study involve 6 12 year-old moderate severe allergic asthmatic , steroid reduction possible 100 % treated patient verse 66.7 % placebo treat patient ( Milgrom , 2001 ) . Other steroid reduction study similar result ( Buhl 2002 , Soler 2001 ) . Omalizumab also show improve quality life allergic asthmatic measure Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ( AQLQ ) . In adult , AQLQ demonstrate great improvement 16 , 28 52 week omalizumab treat patient placebo treat ( Finn 2003 ) . Similarly pediatric population , AQLQ improvement reach statistical significance omalizumab treat patient ( Lemanske 2002 ) . Omalizumab show promise new therapy treatment moderate severe allergic asthma . It currently indicate patient non-allergic asthma . The objective study define effect omalizumab cell surface FceRI expression serum IgE non-allergic asthmatic .</detailed_description>
