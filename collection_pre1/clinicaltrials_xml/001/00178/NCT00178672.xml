	<brief_title>A Single Center Carotid Stenting With Distal Protection Treatment Obstructive Carotid Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single center , prospective , open-label feasibility study evaluate safety effectiveness Carotid Stenting . The study population include patient atherosclerotic obstructive lesion and/or post-endarterectomy restenotic obstructive lesion native carotid artery . The intention include patient types lesion . At 30-day , 6-month 1-year post-procedure clinical visit , procedure include neurological examination evaluation adverse event . A carotid ultrasound perform 6 month 1 year procedure . Guidelines stop study event rate stroke death exceed twice expect frequency event treat surgical endarterectomy technique . The control rate utilized drawn NASCET Trial . Patients meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion ( specify section 4.1 4.2 respectively ) offer choice participate study . . Within inclusion/exclusion criterion include patient would otherwise high risk surgical endarterectomy . This would include patient restenosis endarterectomy , radical neck dissection , contralateral carotid artery occlusion , high take-off carotid bifurcation disease . Since 1989 , 8000 carotid artery stent procedure perform worldwide success rate 98.6 % . This procedure combine distal protection device , predict show even great success rate decrease adverse event patient . For reason , patient significant carotid artery disease felt high risk surgical correction offer chance enroll registry . The patient refer stroke team also vascular surgery . The potential risk , include recent stroke , excessive cardiopulmonary risk , last remaining patent vessel , etc consider well risk traditional medical surgical therapy . All treatment option along possible risk benefit extensively discuss . Cases review multidisciplinary team schedule conference . It determine time whether patient may candidate carotid stenting . If criterion meet , procedure study well option explain patient . An extensive discussion occur patient family regard potential treatment option , risk , benefit . If patient wish proceed carotid stenting include study , office visit make investigator previously do possible procedure date set visit investigator . At office visit , study inform consent explain . All question answer patient , wish , agree study signing inform consent . The patient family give phone number call additional concern question repeatedly encourage contact u arise concern procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient must &gt; 18 year age . 2 . The patient must clinically symptomatic , i.e. , within previous 120 day experience ipsilateral carotid artery distribution , either 1 ) one TIAs , characterize distinct focal neurologic dysfunction monocular blindness clearing sign symptom within 24 hour , 2 ) one complete stroke ( define protocol ) persistence symptom sign 24 hour ( recent event use qualify event ) . Except excluded , patient must document stenosis &gt; 60 % , common internal carotid artery . For asymptomatic patient consider , patient must &gt; 70 % diameter stenosis internal common carotid artery without neurological symptom . 3 . An angiogram require qualify patient , recent feasible acceptable do &gt; 120 day study entry . 4 . An ultrasound use screening procedure potential eligible patient perform less 30 day prior study entry . Stenosis &gt; 50 % : PSV &gt; 130 cm/sec ; EDV &lt; 135 cm/sec Stenosis &gt; 80 % : PSV &gt; 220 cm/sec ; EDV ³135 cm/sec PSV ICA/PSV CCA ratio ³ 4.011 5 . The stenosis must presume atherosclerotic origin secondary restenosis previous endarterectomy . 6 . The target lesion may native common internal carotid artery 7 . Temporary cardiac pacing patient must possible , necessary , along necessary hemodynamic support vasopressor agent hemodynamic monitoring . 8 . Patients take warfarin may include dosage reduce procedure result INR 1.5 less Prothrombin Time 15 second . Warfarin may restart procedure . 9 . Female patient childbearing potential must document negative pregnancy test index hospitalization exposure radiation drug ( antiplatelet agent , anticoagulant agent ) give cath lab procedure would potentially harmful unborn fetus . 10 . The patient legally authorize representative must sign write informed consent , prior procedure , use form approve local Institutional Review Board Medical Ethics Committee . Candidates exclude study ANY follow condition apply : 1 . The patient intracranial hemorrhage , hemorrhagic stroke , major stroke , stroke mass effect demonstrate CT scan MRI within four week index procedure . 2 . The patient intracranial mass lesion 3 . The patient ipsilateral intracranial extracranial arterial stenosis great severity treatment lesion . 4 . The patient know allergy heparin , ticlopidine clopidogrel metal use stent . 5 . The patient history prior lifethreatening reaction radiocontrast agent . 6 . The patient peripheral vascular , supraaortic internal carotid artery tortuosity preclude use catheterbased technique require successful result . 7 . Femoral access possible . 8 . The patient , female , positive pregnancy test 9 . The patient intracranial aneurysm ( &gt; 6 mm ) . 10 . The patient arteriovenous malformation territory target carotid artery . 11 . The patient unstable angina evolve MI . . 12 . The patient history bleed diathesis coagulopathy .</criteria>
