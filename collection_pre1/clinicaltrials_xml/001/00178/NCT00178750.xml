	<brief_title>`` Loss Resistance '' Versus CompuFlo® Epidural Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It possible utilize epidural anesthesia sole anesthetic technique thoracic , abdominal , low extremity surgery , method postoperative pain management surgery , pain relief labor delivery . However , despite various benefit epidural anesthesia , procedure utilized maximum potential operating room . One reason inadequate utilization procedure difficulty properly identify epidural space . Current techniques identify epidural space rely subjective perception operator loss resistance air saline needle pass ligamentum flavum epidural space . CompuFlo® 's pressure-sensing technology provide objective measurement proper placement epidural . Very little advancement make improve training identify correct location epidural space . Epidural anesthesia relatively high failure rate perform resident train . The skill trainees differ greatly , standard teach method teach epidural anesthesia . Statistical analysis conduct Naik et al . conclude resident may need many 75 attempt epidural anesthesia ensure proficiency . The CompuFlo® computerize syringe pump capable volume pressure-controlled infusion . It pressure sensor mathematical algorithm capable determine pressure needle tip . Pressures continuously monitor displayed , reflect acoustic change tone . A dramatic pressure decrease high tissue compliance ( pressure increase despite continuous infusion ) signify entrance epidural space . Combining program low upper pressure limit high infusion rate mimic technique use loss resistance saline proponent ( constant pressure plunger ) . It combine `` feel '' insert epidural needle visualization pressure level , well sound indicator indicate proper placement .</detailed_description>
