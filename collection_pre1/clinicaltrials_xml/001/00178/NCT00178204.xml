	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify specific chemotherapy-related change sleep stages/architecture may relate increase fatigue individual cancer . The researcher hypothesize fatigue experienced cancer patient receive chemotherapy part due change restorative sleep non-rapid eye movement cycle sleep ( i.e. , delta activity ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep Architecture Chemotherapy-Related Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies show strong positive correlation self-reported change sleep cancer patient ' fatigue , also objective measure sleep continuity , [ i.e. , actigraphy polysomnography ( PSG ) ] self-reported fatigue . Chemotherapy disrupt normal sleep pattern , fatigue , later stag chemotherapy , may occur result disturbed nocturnal sleep continuity . However , cause chemotherapy-related fatigue remain unknown , whether abnormal sleep architecture contribute debilitate effect yet explore . We believe fatigue experience many cancer patient receive chemotherapy due , least part , change delta activity [ i.e. , restorative sleep non-rapid eye movement ( NREM ) cycle sleep ] . A find slow wave sleep abnormality play significant role fatigue would prompt confirmatory study support control intervention study . Comparisons : In clinical trial individual cancer prior , , completion chemotherapy , identify compare specific chemotherapy-related change sleep stages/architecture may relate increase fatigue . These change measure actigraphy , PSG , patient self-reporting technique ( e.g. , sleep diary , questionnaire ) . The primary objective : - examine role delta sleep development chemotherapy-induced fatigue cancer patient Secondary objective : - characterize involvement element sleep architecture [ e.g. , rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep ] change sleep continuity relate development chemotherapy-induced fatigue cancer patient - examine role sleep architecture persistence chemotherapy-induced fatigue - examine ( post hoc analysis ) relationship various physical symptom patient variable may relate fatigue ( e.g. , pain , hot flash , anxiety , hemoglobin , menopausal status , sleep continuity , QOL ) , follow chemotherapy . Answers question provide information helpful develop potential target intervention reduce fatigue .</detailed_description>
