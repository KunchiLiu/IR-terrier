	<brief_summary>Established 1995 , Resources Enhancing Alzheimer 's Caregiver Health ( REACH ) unique , multi-site research program sponsor National Institute Aging ( NIA ) National Institute Nursing Research ( NINR ) . The primary purpose REACH carry social behavioral research intervention design enhance family caregiving Alzheimer 's disease relate disorder . Specifically , REACH two goal : test effectiveness multiple different intervention evaluate pool effect REACH intervention overall . REACH grow National Institute Health ( NIH ) initiative acknowledge well-documented burden associate family caregiving well existence promise family caregiver intervention report literature .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Six site ( Boston , Birmingham , Memphis , Miami , Palo Alto , Philadelphia ) develop evaluate variety multi-component intervention family caregiver person Alzheimer ’ Disease ( AD ) mild moderate level impairment . The multi-component intervention implement across six site include : 1 ) Individual Information Support strategy , 2 ) Group Support Family Systems therapy , 3 ) Psychoeducational Skill-based Training approach , 4 ) Home-based Environmental intervention , , 5 ) Enhanced Technology Support Systems . Although intervention derive diverse theoretical model , consistent basic health-stress model goal change nature specific stressor ( e.g . problem behavior care recipient ) , appraisal , and/or caregiver response stressor . All REACH intervention guide detailed treatment manual certification procedure assure intervention deliver consistently time site . Careful attention also pay issue treatment integrity . Different strategy use site induce assess three fundamental aspect treatment integrity : delivery , receipt , enactment ( Burgio , et al. , 2001 ) . In addition , caregiving experience race ethnic minority family particularly neglected field , strong emphasis place inclusion African American Hispanic caregiver . Thus , assessment well intervention tailor site meet need culturally diverse racial/ethnic majority minority population . All REACH site share several common goal , include : 1 ) design theory-driven caregiving intervention test hypothesis intervention process effect family caregiver , 2 ) specify intervention component help u understand pathway intervention produce desire outcome , 3 ) develop standardize outcome protocol assess impact different strategy caregiver care recipient within site across site , 4 ) create common database would facilitate pool data across site . In addition , standard selection criterion adopt REACH . Although REACH feature traditional multi-site randomize controlled clinical trial ( e.g. , random assignment participant treatment control condition , common database outcome measure , identical measurement interval across site ) , differ one key dimension—the intervention vary across site . REACH design examine feasibility outcomes multiple different intervention approach , rather provide definitive information efficacy one specific intervention strategy enhance caregiver outcome . The strength approach efficiently yield information effectiveness different approach AD caregiving well combine effect active treatment versus control , report planned meta-analysis . REACH successfully randomize 1222 caregiver/care recipient dyad represent majority minority population 15 different condition .</detailed_description>
