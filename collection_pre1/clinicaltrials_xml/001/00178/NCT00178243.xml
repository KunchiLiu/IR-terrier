	<brief_summary>A study conduct University Rochester Cancer Center ( URCC ) patient liver cancer treat high dose conformal radiation therapy . This type radiation use new technique aim radiation site disease allow tumor receive high dose surround normal liver tissue receive low enough dose normal tissue remain free injury . The purpose study determine conformal radiation therapy safe , tolerable effective treating liver cancer determine side effect cause treatment . A second objective determine level special type protein ( call cytokine ) find blood related treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must new hepatic lesion suggestive metastasis , otherwise biopsy proven disease previously negative scan . Patients chemotherapy responsive resistant disease acceptable . Primary hepatobiliary tumor also acceptable . In case , patient must deem unresectable hepatic surgeon . Patients multiple hepatic lesion may include meet volumetric criterion dose specification . Likewise , patient metastasis organ liver , patient residual primary disease may include judged longevity determine hepatic disease . KPS ≥70 Age ≥ 18 year Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl , AST &lt; 2.5 x normal , ALT &lt; 2.5 x normal , Platelets &gt; 80,000/mm3 Chemotherapy treatment radiation allow Informed consent must obtained. , Patient must judge unresectable hepatic surgeon , must refuse surgery Patient must able tolerate radiation treatment judge Principal Investigator coPI . Previous Liver resection allow Active disease outside liver allow . Liver lesion visible CT MRI . No active hepatitis radiographic evidence diffuse macronodular cirrhosis . Patients less degree cirrhosis , associate portal hypertension hepatic failure , eligible radiation schedule total dose appropriately modify . Women pregnant</criteria>
