	<brief_summary>Irradiation tissue create change tissue . Ionizing radiation imparts charge tissue interacts tissue component , change tissue structure . The specific type modification also depend extent upon type tissue irradiate . It show possible read tooth enamel irradiation record use technique electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) , electron spin resonance ( ESR ) . It propose examine radiation responses approximately one hundred ( 100 ) human teeth . This would include teeth free , well contain , amalgam ( silver ) restoration . For first group , teeth already collect ( pre-existing pathological specimen ) would use . These teeth surgical/pathological discard collect without identifier dental provider .</brief_summary>
