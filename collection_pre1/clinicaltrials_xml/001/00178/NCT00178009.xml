	<brief_summary>Discharge community increasingly become priority patient implant Ventricular Assist Device ( VAD ) . Because VADs complex , patient caregiver often fear leave hospital , although status require hospitalization . This project include development CD/video web-based instructional program management VAD controller patient caregiver ( formal informal ) . A clinical trial use examine discharge rate placement follow patient educate usual care vs. self-pace CD/video condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Developing Assessing Competencies Caregivers Patients With Ventricular Assist Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Discharge community increasingly become priority patient implant Ventricular Assist Device ( VAD ) . The current study design develop Artificial Heart Continuity Care Competency Program ( AHC3P ) ensure safety feasibility return community . This program identify delineate step-by-step procedure require care patient 's ventricular assist device ( VAD ) daily basis , emergency . These step-by-step procedure use develop self-paced learning CD/video program patient caregiver competency . The competency also use Artificial Heart Program team ass caregiver skill , provide direct feedback step need revision in-depth instruction . Subjects recruit four phase . Training four phase conduct member AHP team . During Phase I , VAD recipients videotape undergo current Artificial Heart Program ( AHP ) training . During Phase II , VAD recipients caregiver recruit control group also undergo current AHP training . Phase III involve patient informal caregiver undergo AHC3P serve experimental group . Data regard self-efficacy trainee length time number trial require achieve competency AHC3P compare train program currently place . During fourth phase , health care professional UPMC recruit undergo AHC3P training . Data regard self-efficacy prior training program compare .</detailed_description>
