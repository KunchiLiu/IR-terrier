	<brief_title>Proteomics Brain Trauma-associated Elevated Intracranial Pressure ( ICP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One major cause death follow brain trauma increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) . Currently , effective way predict ICP patient reach uncontrollable level . Various cytokine ( balance pro-and anti-inflammatory ) factor think underlie increase ICP . The specific aim research determine blood brain-injured patient contain reproducible protein marker appear prior elevation ICP . We propose employ mass spectrometry , antibody array ELISA profile protein serum patient suffer traumatic brain injury . These protein profile compile pattern recognition program capacity learn make prediction base spectra associate patient information . Each time sample analyze , add database allow program make increasingly accurate prediction . Protein profile patient know ICP value analyze . Our hypothesis alteration serum protein composition precede change intracranial pressure give rise predictable pattern detect use large-scale proteomic analysis . After approximately 90 non-brain trauma 90 brain-trauma patient analyze , marker find , predictability elevate ICP test . If successful , may aid neurosurgeon determine future course treatment .</detailed_description>
