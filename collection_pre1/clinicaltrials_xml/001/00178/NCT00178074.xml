	<brief_title>The Effects Sleep Deprivation Antidepressant Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seek good understand effect sleep deprivation ( TSD ) brain function use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) . PET establish research procedure produce image brain . The purpose image show change brain activity associate sleep deprivation . The neurochemical mechanism underlie TSD acceleration antidepressant efficacy identify . An understanding neurochemical process may lead development pharmacologic strategy would accelerate antidepressant response directly development antidepressant treatment efficacious . This study conduct collaboration Dr. Charles Reynolds ' ongoing protocol `` Geriatric Depression : Neurobiology Treatment '' ( IRB # 970356 ) . The impetus clinical study find clinical response antidepressant treatment geriatric depress patient delay , median time remission report 12 week . Thus , development strategy accelerate treatment response would represent substantial contribution treatment geriatric depression . One approach report accelerate antidepressant response mid-life depression one night total sleep deprivation ( TSD ) prior initiate antidepressant treatment . TSD also show improve mood depressed patient , response TSD may distinguish subsequent treatment responder non-responders depressive relapse may occur nap night recovery sleep . The neurochemical mechanism underlie TSD acceleration antidepressant efficacy identify . An understanding neurochemical process may lead development pharmacologic strategy would accelerate antidepressant response directly development antidepressant treatment efficacious . Advancements brain image technology radiotracer chemistry make possible measure metabolic activity specific neurochemical mechanism use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) . The proposed study represent initial step characterize neurochemical alteration produce TSD impact TSD antidepressant response TSD geriatric depress patient use PET radiotracer brain glucose metabolism , [ 18F ] -2deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose ( [ 18F ] -2DG ) . Having establish regional metabolic alteration associate sleep deprivation recovery sleep patient subsequent treatment responder compare metabolic change treatment non-responders , future study undertake use neuroreceptor radiotracers define specific neurochemical pathway subserve regional pattern metabolic alteration . The glucose metabolic response sleep deprivation mid-life depression investigate UPMC PET Facility institution ( e.g . Dube et al. , preparation , Wu et al. , 1991 , 1992 ) . The study perform geriatric depressed patient compare PET study conduct mid-life depressed patient assess contribution age process neurometabolic response sleep .
