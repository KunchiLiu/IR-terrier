	<brief_title>Comparison Video Macintosh Laryngoscope Patients Who May Difficult Intubate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite improvement make traditional laryngoscope blade since invention , occasionally intubation trachea accomplish facility , even patient anatomy predict difficult intubation . It estimate endotracheal intubation perform 8 million patient per year United States . Of endotracheal intubation , approximately 80 % perform direct laryngoscopy transoral placement endotracheal tube ( ET ) trachea . There fairly uniform report incidence fail intubation literature ; occur approximately 0.05 % 1:2230 surgical patient approximately 0.13 % 0.35 % , 1:750 1:280 , obstetric patient . The incidence unsuspected difficult intubation estimate high 3 % . One factor contribute difficult intubation poor visualization . The VL design optimize visualization present operator enlarge video image airway structure . In contrast , use conventional laryngoscopy , anesthesiologists `` keyhole '' view airway structure ; view may obscure attempt pass ET . The VL consist laryngoscope handle Macintosh blade modify provide video image airway structure screen , conveniently locate directly front anesthesiologist . A micro video module contain modified handle . An image/light bundle introduce standard blade . This system previously test consensus device extremely easy learn use anesthesiologist familiar use Macintosh blade . It also useful instruction laryngoscopy non-anesthesiologists . There several potential advantage video image context direct laryngoscopy . The system provide high quality video image enlarge video monitor easy visualization . If laryngeal manipulation require improve visualization laryngeal structure , intubator person assist coordinate movement observe , simultaneously , image video monitor . With video image project distal end laryngoscope blade , laryngeal structure keep view ET pass oropharynx trachea . Comparison : Video Laryngoscope conduit possible difficult intubation compare traditional Macintosh blade .</detailed_description>
