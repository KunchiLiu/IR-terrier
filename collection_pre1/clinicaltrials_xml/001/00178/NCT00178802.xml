	<brief_summary>Thermal therapy ( hyperthermia heat ) increase effect chemotherapy treatment . By , thermal therapy also kill cancer cell . By use thermal therapy treat whole body , investigator treat cancer cell wherever throughout entire body . In study , investigator test combination thermal therapy combine chemotherapy see : 1. improves effect chemotherapy drug , 2. help body fight cancer cell , 3. treatment safe patient . This study offer heat treatment alone . Any patient advance metastatic breast , endometrial cancer resistant standard treatment may treat phase II protocol therapy ; however , patient need undergo medical test make sure treatment would safe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With Whole Body Hyperthermia Treat Resistant Breast , Endometrial , Cervical Ovarian Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Once patient accept study , patient need Central Venous line ( CV line port ) already one . ( may place patient 's doctor , do ) . The treatment cycle begin continuous 24-hour intravenous infusion 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) period 5 day . This regimen end 24 hour prior schedule heat treatment . In addition , begin treatment , patient begin daily , low-dose Interferon-alpha injection duration participation study . The drug , Interferon-alpha , give stimulate immune system decrease tumor microvasculature . Interferon-alpha also interrupt division cancer cell slow tumor growth . The fever-range whole-body heat treatment perform patient light conscious sedation . With type sedation , patient awake treatment uncomfortable . This type sedation method use reduce discomfort 6-hour heat treatment procedure yet allow patient respond verbal command . The patient 's body temperature elevate 40oC ( 104oF ) period 60-90 minute . When body reach target 40 oC , maintain body temperature six hour . At conclusion six hour heat treatment , patient cool normal body temperature , 30-45 minute . The Doxil chemotherapy infuse i.v . period 2 hour . The entire procedure last approximately 8-10 hour . After treatment complete , observe patient 2 12 hour make sure treatment well tolerate . The patient continue daily low-dose Interferon-alpha injection . Additionally , patient give daily Leukine ( sargramostim ) cytokine injection usually begin 3-5 day receive chemotherapy help support immune system help body create white blood cell , important help body fight infection . After treatment , patient need complete blood count platelet differential count week . These lab study do patient 's doctor 's office long result fax u . They also do clinic . The treatment cycle repeat every 28 day . We always attempt perform least two thermochemotherapy cycle . After second treatment , CT and/or MRI scan repeat see tumor change . These scan , along physical examination lab study , use determine additional heat treatment perform . Additional treatment continue base well patient responds treatment . There limit number heat treatment patient may .</detailed_description>
