	<brief_summary>Currently , emergency physician limited access obtain formal radiology ultrasound study , particularly overnight . Many force adopt risky expensive strategy manage patient suspected deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) present off-hours : low risk patient , discharge without anticoagulation arrange outpatient study ; moderate high risk patient , empirically anticoagulating admit hospital await definitive testing . If emergency physician could reliably perform accurate ultrasound exam DVT , risk could obviate . This prospective , observational cohort study assess accuracy emergency physician diagnosis proximal DVT use compact ultrasound equipment simplify compression technique . The value color flow doppler augmentation also assess . Outcomes ( sensitivity , specificity , positive likelihood ratio negative likelihood ratio ) assess 30 day . Prior enrol patient study , emergency physician undertake 2 hour training course performance simplify compression technique diagnosis low extremity DVT . Emergency physicians perform DVT ultrasound exam study subject suspect DVT . Clinical management study subject alter ; subject proceed receive formal DVT ultrasound study radiology department serve criterion reference study .</brief_summary>
