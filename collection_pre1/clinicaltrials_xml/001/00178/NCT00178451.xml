	<brief_summary>In first portion study , goal determine safety drug Abciximab use period open carotid artery surgery . In addition , use specialize ultrasound equipment ( probe place outside skin head ) , aim measure number particle release around time surgery treat Abciximab . The second phase study determine Abciximab safely reduce number particle release bloodstream around time surgery order reduce risk stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stroke Prevention With Abciximab Carotid Endarterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carotid endarterectomy frequently perform vascular procedure United States . In last decade , large increase case volume follow confirmation efficacy endarterectomy carotid artery atherosclerotic disease NASCET ACAS trial . Estimates 1994 suggest 130,000 patient underwent carotid endarterectomy United States . Despite efficacy endarterectomy medical management extra cranial cerebral vascular disease , risk ipsilateral perioperative stroke carotid endarterectomy remain 2-7 % . There two main type operation-related stroke . The intra-operative stroke apparent upon recovery anesthesia directly attributable intra-operative ischemia embolization . The post-operative stroke occur sometime uneventful recovery surgery due vessel occlusion embolization thrombogenic endarterectomy surface . Evidence suggest platelet adhere expose collagen endarterectomy surface within minute restore flow . The maximal rate adherence appear one hour clamp release . Postoperative stroke precede micro-particulate embolization , detect transcranial Doppler ultrasound . There good correlation TCD detection 25 embolus middle cerebral artery distribution ten-minute period surgery increase occurrence transient ischemic attack stroke . Another study find embolic rate great 50 per hour predict stroke 50 % patient . Further study TCD prevalence post-operative micro particulate thromboembolic event carotid endarterectomy find five percent patient sustain postoperative embolization . The embolic rate maximal first two hour postoperatively evidence find embolization third post-operative hour unlikely occur thereafter . Infusion Dextran 40 show decrease rate embolization micro particulate debris . Recent success decrease thrombotic event percutaneous coronary intervention acute myocardial infarction platelet glycoprotein IIB/IIIA antagonists stimulate interest further application drug . A recent randomized clinical trial use Abciximab acute ischemic stroke document safety administer twenty-four hour stroke onset , trend toward improvement functional outcome . Abciximab also use conjunction heparin aspirin carotid artery percutaneous angioplasty stenting think potentially reduce recurrent stenosis . Unfortunately , use platelet IIb/IIIa inhibitor open surgical procedure study due concern bleed . Study Aims : Use platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist hold great potential diminishing eliminate micro particulate embolization see TCD thus help lower combine operative morbidity mortality less five percent rate commonly accept . Our primary aim document safety ideal dose Abciximab use open vascular surgery , namely Carotid Endarterectomy . Our secondary aim evaluate incidence perioperative embolic event carotid endarterectomy monitor transcranial Doppler perioperative administration Abciximab .</detailed_description>
