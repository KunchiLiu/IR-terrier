	<brief_summary>Thermal therapy ( hyperthermia , heat ) enhance chemotherapy anti-tumor kill . Thermal therapy also kill cancer cell . Whole-body thermotherapy systemic treatment include entire body . By use fever-range whole-body thermal therapy , cancer cell treat wherever throughout entire body . In study , test combination fever-range thermal therapy combine chemotherapy test : 1 ) response metastatic advanced pancreas cancer combine modality treatment thermotherapy select chemotherapy ; 2 ) whether help body immunity fight pancreas cancer ; 3 ) treatment safe patient . This study offer thermal therapy alone . Any patient measurable , inoperable metastatic pancreatic cancer may treat ; however , need undergo specific medical test make sure treatment would safe . We hypothesize combined-modality therapy use fever-range whole-body hyperthermia ( FR-WBH ; temperature = 40 C ; duration = 6 h ) , administer optimized time/sequence schedule cisplatin , gemcitabine HCl ( gemcitabine ) , metronomically administer , low-dose interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) patient inoperable metastatic pancreas cancer , , without induce intolerable toxicity : . ) decrease pancreatic cancer size ; b . ) improve quality life ; c. ) enhance immune response cancer ; d. ) increase survival ; e. ) allow inoperable pancreatic cancer convert operable disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment cycle begin 6 hour intravenous ( IV ) hydration follow infusion anti-cancer drug , Cisplatin . In addition , begin treatment , begin low-dose Interferon-alpha injection entire duration participation study . The drug , Interferon-alpha , interrupts division cancer cell , destroy tumor blood vessel , slow tumor growth . Forty-eight hour Cisplatin infusion , treat fever-range thermal therapy ( whole-body hyperthermia , heat ) . When core body temperature reach 104oF ( 40oC ) , 30-minute ( IV ) infusion another chemotherapy drug , gemcitabine ( Gemzar ) give . Cisplatin , low-dose Interferon-a gemcitabine chemotherapy drug use treatment plan . No chemotherapy drug allow give treatment plan . The fever-range whole-body heat treatment carry lightly sedate . With sedation , awake able talk treatment , however uncomfortable . This sedation use reduce discomfort 6-hour heat treatment procedure yet allow speak nurse . Your body temperature raise 104oF ( 40oC ) period 60-120 minute . When body first reach target 104oF , administer gemcitabine chemotherapy 60 minute continue maintain 104 oF body temperature six hour . At conclusion six hour thermal treatment , cool normal body temperature , take 30-45 minute . The entire treatment last approximately 8 hour . After treatment complete , observe 2 12 hour make sure tolerate treatment without problem . You continue low-dose Interferon-alpha . Additionally , give 5-10 day Leukine ( sargramostim ) cytokine injection usually begin 3-5 day receive chemotherapy help support immune system help body create white blood cell . White blood cell important help body fight infection . After treatment , need complete blood count platelet differential count week . These lab study do doctor 's office hospital long make sure result fax u . They also do clinic . We see approximately three four week treatment cycle repeat . We always attempt perform least two thermo-chemotherapy cycle . After second treatment , CT and/or MRI scan repeat see cancer small . These scan , along physical examination lab study , use determine additional heat treatment perform . Additional treatment continue base well respond treatment . We limit number heat treatment patient may use chemotherapy drug total six treatment .</detailed_description>
