	<brief_title>An RCT Preventing Pressure Ulcers With Wheelchair Seat Cushions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pressure ulcer ( aka pressure sore , bed sore decubitus ulcer ) significant healthcare problem grow number United States elderly long-term care ( LTC ) resident . Pressure ulcer ( PU ) diminish quality life , exact devastating loss function , increase risk death geriatric population raise healthcare cost . Despite Federal preventive mandate long-term care ( LTC ) setting , widespread non-compliance occurs . The last three Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) LTC survey show cumulative increase 21 % number citation issue failure provide proper intervention prevent treat pressure ulcer . Costs management PU US likely exceed $ 6.4 billion annually prevalence approximately 28 % LTC population . Estimates number sitting-acquired PU elderly , at-risk population range 36-50 % . Several study , include pilot investigation , support estimate suggest use wheelchair cushion design reduce interface pressure reduce incidence sitting-acquired PU . Despite evidence , elderly wheelchair user routinely evaluate seat position need definitive study complete justify funding seating intervention . Consequently , elderly Medicare beneficiary deny access medically necessary clinically appropriate intervention instead frequently provide convolute segmented-foam cushion design pressure ulcer prevention . The primary aim propose multi-site , randomized pressure-reducing wheelchair trial ( PRWC-II ) determine efficacy pressure-reducing cushion prevent sitting-acquired pressure ulcer elderly , nurse home population . Positive result propose trial provide level evidence need change standard care include routine evaluation at-risk resident seat position needs provision pressure-reducing cushion preventive measure sitting-acquired pressure ulcer . If hypothesis valid , intervention result decrease incidence prevalence sitting-acquired pressure ulcer , reduce healthcare cost , improve quality life .</detailed_description>
