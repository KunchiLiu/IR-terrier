	<brief_title>Comparative Efficacy Three Preparations Botox-A Treating Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spasticity one debilitating complication neurologic condition , stroke , brain injury , spinal cord injury , cerebral palsy , multiple sclerosis . Although exact pathophysiology unknown , believe result imbalance ascend excitatory influence descend inhibitory component central nervous system . Clinically , spasticity manifest abnormally increase muscle tone , associate loss range motion , increase muscle stretch reflex , clonus , weakness , incoordination . If inadequately treat , spasticity lead disability increase health care cost . Common complication inadequately treated spasticity include joint muscle contracture , pain , difficulty perform activity daily live hygiene , impaired transfer ambulation . Acquired brain injury ( ABI ) , include stroke , traumatic brain injury , encephalopathy , often lead long-term impairment , include spasticity . In severe case , spasticity difficult frustrating treat patient population , since individual may tolerate side effect conventional therapy ABI-related deficit arousal cognition . Systemic medication , baclofen tizanidine , effective control spasticity ; however , may also cause sleepiness drowsiness , impair memory thinking process -- -adverse effect individual ABI may tolerate . Thus , `` local '' treatment , neurolysis chemodenervation use botulinum toxin , become superior treatment option individual ABI , since devoid usual side effect systemic medication . They also effective control spasticity , yet impair arousal cognition . The medical literature replete report efficacy botulinum toxin-A management spasticity . Thus , current challenge clinician researcher time find way enhance efficacy botulinum toxin . One way achieve exploit certain property toxin . Animal study clinical experience show effect drug dose-dependent . One property flexibility preparing volume drug inject . Since botulinum toxin , currently available ( BOTOX-A® ) United States , require reconstitution preservative-free saline , flexibility clinician manipulate volume solution administer , without alter dose . We recently complete trial compare effect two volume preparation BOTOX-A® wrist finger flexor spasticity individual ABI . One group patient receive BOTOX-A® prepare 100 units/cc , another receive BOTOX-A® prepare 50 units/cc . Although statistically significant difference two group , trend favor group receive high volume , i.e . ; appear improve base decrease muscle tone ( measure Modified Ashworth Scale ) . This compare clinician 's global impression high volume group improve . The latter measure achieve statistical significance . One possible reason absence statistical significance `` high '' volume ( 50 units/cc ) high enough . Thus , propose study investigate comparative effect three preparation BOTOX-A® .</detailed_description>
