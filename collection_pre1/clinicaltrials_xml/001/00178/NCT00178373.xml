	<detailed_description>Fatigue common troublesome side effect experience cancer patient , chemotherapy radiation treatment . This protocol increase knowledge occurrence treatment fatigue develop cancer treatment rationale : 1. good control fatigue report patient follow cancer treatment need , 2. systematic data etiology fatigue follow cancer treatment , 3. evidence indicate chemotherapy associate cognitive dysfunction . Comparisons : In randomize , placebo-controlled study cancer patient follow chemotherapy radiation therapy , assess efficacy modafinil relieve cancer-related fatigue actigraphy prevent improve cognitive dysfunction computer-generated task previously utilized examine drug-induced change performance ( CDR Cognitive Assessment ) . Additional outcome measure include Fatigue Symptom Checklist , POMS , Fatigue Severity Scale , sleepiness measure Epworth Sleepiness Scale , cytokine blood level , depression measure CES-D , psychological adjustment cancer measure Mini-MAC . The primary objective : - compare change patient report fatigue follow completion chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment cancer patient receive open-label modafinil ( PROVIGIL® ) 4 week Secondary objective : - ass persistence effect find randomize trial responder modafinil placebo 4 week ( responder report least 1 point decrease fatigue measure Brief Fatigue Inventory ) - ass degree modafinil prevent reduce cognitive dysfunction follow treatment cancer - investigate potential relationship among depression , fatigue , cytokine , cognitive dysfunction Anticipated result could provide potentially important new information regard clinical , theoretical , methodologic application ; , improve pharmacologic perhaps behavioral control debilitate fatigue commonly experience patient undergoing treatment cancer .</detailed_description>
