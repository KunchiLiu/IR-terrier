	<detailed_description>While often life save , need admission pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) place child profoundly artificial environment potential alter biological process defend homeostasis . All live organism biological rhythm serve basic organize feature . These rhythms vary widely , range second ( e.g. , heartbeat ) week ( menstrual cycle ) . Biological rhythms 24-hour cycle term circadian rhythm . Of many circadian rhythm , sleep-wake cycle evident [ 2 ] . Other biological process circadian rhythm include growth hormone , melatonin , cortisol secretion . Sleep disrupt PICU . This disruption report study use : ( ) observation sleep-wake cycle [ 6 , 7 ] ; ( b ) self-reports child , ( c ) objective measure ( e.g. , electroencephalograph ( EEG ) . Noise light level correlate profound sleep disruption PICU . Sleep disruption know profound impact overall health child , physiological psychological standpoint . In addition , sleep disruption show change cortisol level , cause impair immune response impair cognitive function child adult . Disruption sleep also know impair heal many complex connection homeostatic process human body . There dearth research improve sleep reverse negative effect sleep disruption homeostasis critically ill child RQ1 : What effect wear earplug critically ill child admit PICU : 1 . Sleep state 2 .
