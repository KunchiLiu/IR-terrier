	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate use injection Botox ( botulinum toxin type A ) treatment chronic neck pain . Botox approve treatment patient cervical dystonia . Cervical dystonia chronic condition characterize involuntary movement neck often painful . In study , response Botox patient neck pain associated cervical dystonia compare pain response patient cervical dystonia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin Type A ( Botox ) Treatment Cervical Dystonia Upper Thoracic Muscular Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical dystonia ( CD ) condition characterize involuntary movement neck . Generally movements rotational frequently associate significant pain . Treatment CD oral medication usually unsuccessful current treatment choice majority patient consist periodic injection botulinum toxin offend muscle . Resistant case consider candidate selective surgical denervation procedure . Botulinum toxin type A ( Botox® ) FDA approve treatment CD . Botox® safely use treat CD clinic since 1989 . In controlled trial , Botox® significantly improve pain patient CD . Cervico-thoracic pain syndrome associate dystonia ( refractory cervicothoracic myofascial pain syndrome CMPS ) chronic regional pain syndrome . It common component acute chronic pain syndrome , occur 14 % U.S. population . This pain often resistant treatment characterize series tender trigger point . These often injected local anesthetic provide temporary relief pain patient . Recent uncontrolled trial suggest Botox® may helpful patient CMPS . Most attempt use Botox® treat Patients utilized small dos Botox® use typically treat CD . Also , study use Botox® injection tender trigger point rather belly muscle commonly do treat CD . In study use dose Botox® typically use treat CD . Injections Botox® guide EMG determine area involuntarily fire muscle rather solely tender trigger point . The result patient CMPS compare pain relief experienced CD . It hop trial provide pilot data planning large safety efficacy trial Botox® chronic cervico-thoracic pain associated CD .</detailed_description>
