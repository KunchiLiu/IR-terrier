	<detailed_description>There 96 subject recruit study . Based power analysis repeat measure analysis variance , sample size require investigation 24 subject per group base 90 % confidence interval alpha 0.05 . There 24 subject Group 1 ( intraarticular bupivicaine infusion ) . There 24 subject Group 2 ( patellar tendon harvest site bupivicaine ) . There 24 subject Group 3 ( intraarticular patellar tendon harvest site bupivicaine ) . There 24 subject control , Group 4 ( intraarticular infusion physiologic saline ) . All patient recruit discretion principal investigator . The primary outcome measure investigation Postoperative Patient Diary . This document record patient 's subjective evaluation pain , comfort , ability sleep , activity level quality life . The Postoperative Patient Diary administer daily day surgery morning even patient retire 3 postoperative day . All pain medication take 3 day postoperative evaluation record Postoperative Patient Diary . The investigational treatment investigation use Pain Care 3000 continuous infusion regional anesthesia device accept pharmacologic modality control postoperative pain continuous infusion local anesthetic agent ( bupivicaine 0.5 % ) intraarticularly ( Group 1 ) , patellar tendon harvest site ( Group 2 ) combine continuous infusion patellar tendon harvest site intraarticular infusion ( Group 3 ) . Patients randomly assign control group ( Group 4 ) receive intraarticular infusion physiologic saline . The catheter deliver 2 cc bupivicaine 0.5 % per hour total . In patient Group 3 , 2 catheter ( 1 patellar tendon harvest site 1 intraarticular infusion ) , catheter connect `` Y '' connector . The dosage bupivicaine split among two site . The device allow delivery 2 cc per hour . The patient adjust alter flow rate . A standard general anesthetic protocol employ discretion supervise anesthesiologist . Prior surgery , patient instruct use continuous infusion device method complete study questionnaire . Catheters place end surgical procedure accord randomization schedule . Patients complete study questionnaire day surgery three consecutive day follow surgery . The clinical evaluation last 3 postoperative day . During postoperative period , sufficient additional pain medication available patient sufficiently control postoperative pain . No analgesic local anesthetic , specify take postoperative period subject . Other medication `` rescue analgesic '' consider necessary patient 's welfare give discretion principal investigator . If medication provide pain relief , patient must request . The administration medication , premedication discharge hospital , must record patient diary direct bearing study outcome . Any medication take pain follow hospital discharge within establish post discharge follow period must record patient diary . The investigator responsible assuring procedure expertise available cope medical emergency may occur study . In case emergency , symptomatic treatment provide accord hospital routine . The reason emergency may constitute serious adverse event . After surgery , patient would discontinue study discover show previously unrecognized allergy medication ( bupivicaine ) . This would rare . If occurs , catheter would immediately remove , thus end infusion medication patient would longer participate study . Standard Care Procedures : Opioid base analgesic derivative standard care manage postoperative pain procedure . These medication administer orally , intramuscularly , intravenously . There difference surgical procedure except insertion catheter surgical site upon closure surgical wound . All patient receive Toradol 30 mg parenterally q6h x2 , follow Toradol 10 mg PO QID 3 day . This anti-inflammatory analgesic effect use prn . Any narcotic use need use track study . All patient ( include study ) keep hospital overnight follow surgery receive patient control analgesia ( PCA ) device intravenous administration morphine night hospital stay . Morphine usage period record . Patients undergo knee surgery admit 23 hour unit , stay overnight , discharge follow morning usually 10:00 . This standard care participate study .</detailed_description>
