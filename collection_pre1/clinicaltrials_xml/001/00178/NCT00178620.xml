	<brief_summary>The PATCAR study design test hypothesis strategy pre-hospital use `` clot busting '' ( thrombolytic ) drug follow emergent heart catheterization include stenting problematic coronary artery , result low mortality reduce repeat heart attack rate . Early identify treat heart attack patient prior arrive hospital , patient qualify `` clot busting '' drug low size heart attack damage . This small heart attack lead few problem less repeat heart attack death future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-hospital Administration Thrombolytic Therapy With Urgent Culprit Artery Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To demonstrate feasibility project pilot trial plan enroll 500 patient pre-hospital thrombolysis/clot busting follow emergent catheterization stenting problematic culprit artery . This comprise EMS system capable perform pre-hospital ECGs follow emergent transportation Level I Cardiovascular Center patient take urgent cardiac catheterization emergent stenting culprit artery . Patients identified typical symptom acute MI ECG consistent acute ST elevation MI screen field paramedic speak hospital ED attend physician use screen form . Verbal Consent obtain receive acute therapy MI outline protocol . After therapy initiate field speak hospital , patient transport quickly possible receive Level I Cardiovascular Center ( Hub Hospital ) . The ED personnel Level I Cardiovascular Center activate Interventional Cardiovascular Team Cath Lab personnel receive initial qualifying transmit ECG . Once patient arrives , inform consent obtain ED investigator and/or in-house Cardiology fellow enrollment PATCAR Trial . Thrombolytic ineligible patient also collect study also go directly Cath Lab PCI . Study coordinator enter data Case Report Forms forward complete form Westat-ALA data capture database . In addition qualify ECG , ECG 's obtained hospital discharge/transfer . All patient follow current standard care STEMI/heart attack patient . Patients Cardiac MRI do day 3 5 hospital stay , measure size amount damage heart suffer result Heart attack .</detailed_description>
