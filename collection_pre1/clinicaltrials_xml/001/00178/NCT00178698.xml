	<brief_summary>Thermal therapy ( hyperthermia , heat ) increase chemotherapy cancer cell kill . By , thermal therapy also kill cancer cell . Whole body thermal therapy systemic treatment ; whole-body fever-range thermal therapy safely treat cancer cell wherever throughout entire body . In study , test combination fever-range heat treatment chemotherapy test 1 ) The response three type cancer ( small-cell lung , neuroendocrine cancer , lung cancer , gastric cancer ) thermo-chemotherapy improve cancer response compare effect chemotherapy drug current use ; 2 ) whether thermo-chemotherapy treatment help person 's body fight cancer cell ; 3 ) whether treatment safe comfortable patient . This study offer heat treatment alone . Any patient inoperable metastatic small cell lung cancer , neuroendocrine cancer ( organ ) , gastric cancer , lung cancer , treat Phase II protocol therapy ; however , patient need undergo select medical test make sure treatment would safe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperthermia/Thermal Therapy With Chemotherapy Treat Inoperable Metastatic Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment cycle begin 6 hour intravenous ( IV ) hydration follow infusion anti-cancer drug , Cisplatin . In addition , begin treatment , begin low-dose Interferon-alpha continue entire duration participation study . The low-dose Interferon-alpha interrupt division cancer cell , kill blood vessel feed cancer , slow tumor growth , well boost body 's immunity cancer . Thirty-six hour cisplatin infusion , treat fever-range thermal therapy ( whole-body hyperthermia ) . The fever-range whole-body thermal therapy enhances effect chemotherapy drug cancer , think also boost immune response cancer . When core body temperature reach 104oF ( 40oC ) , 30-minute ( IV ) infusion another chemotherapy drug , gemcitabine ( Gemzar ) give . Cisplatin , low-dose interferon-alpha gemcitabine chemotherapy drug use treatment protocol . No chemotherapy drug allow give treatment plan . The fever-range whole-body heat treatment perform lightly sedate . With type sedation , awake talk treatment uncomfortable . This type sedation method use reduce discomfort 6-hour heat treatment procedure yet allow talk nurse . Your body temperature raise 104oF ( 40oC ) period 60-120 minute . When body first reach target 104oF , administer gemcitabine chemotherapy 60 minute continue maintain 104oF body temperature six hour . At conclusion six hour thermochemotherapy , cool normal body temperature , take 30-45 minute . The entire treatment last approximately 8 hour . After treatment complete , observe 2 12 hour make sure tolerate treatment . You continue low-dose Interferon-alpha injection weekly . Additionally , give 5-10 day Leukine ( sargramostim , GM-CSF ) injection begin 3-5 day receive chemotherapy help support immune system help body create white blood cell , important help body fight infection . After treatment , need complete blood count platelet differential count week . These lab study do doctor 's office hospital long make sure result fax u . They also do clinic . We see approximately three four week treatment cycle repeat . We always attempt perform least two thermo-chemotherapy cycle . After second treatment , CT and/or MRI scan repeat see cancer small . These scan , along physical examination lab study , use determine additional heat treatment perform . Additional treatment continue base well response treatment . There limit number heat treatment patient may .</detailed_description>
