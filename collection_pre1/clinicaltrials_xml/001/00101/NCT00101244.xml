	<brief_title>SB-715992 Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Solid Tumors Hodgkin 's Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability SB-715992 administer 1-hr intravenous infusion day 1-3 21-day cycle patient solid tumor . II . To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SB-715992 administration schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe clinical response SB-715992 give day 1-3 , every 21-days . II . To characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) SB-715992 administration schedule . III . To explore drug metabolism , molecular cellular predictor efficacy ( biomarkers ) toxicity drug interaction potential . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive SB-715992 IV 1 hour day 1-3 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos SB-715992 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Up 10 additional patient treat MTD Patients follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-31 patient accrue study within 11-19 month .</detailed_description>
