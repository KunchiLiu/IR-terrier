	<brief_title>Tipifarnib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) R115777 ( tipifarnib ) patient relapse , refractory , high risk myeloid leukemia treat accord regimen . II . To assess toxicity preliminary assessment efficacy R115777 patient relapse , refractory , high risk myeloid leukemia . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily day 1-7 15-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR . Patients experience relapse previously achieve CR may receive additional tipifarnib current dose level newly register patient . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos tipifarnib MTD determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
