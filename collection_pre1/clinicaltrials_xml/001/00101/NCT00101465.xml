	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While great progress reduce CVD morbidity mortality U.S. past 40 year , minority group benefit progress , continue low life expectancy high CVD morbidity . On average , minority limit access medical care , receive less aggressive care , receive few diagnostic therapeutic cardiac procedure non-minority population . Additionally , minority group adhere poorly prescribe medical regimen often present emergency department rather primary care physician complication advance chronic CVD condition . Thus , research reduce health disparity improve CVD outcome minorities offer potential substantial positive impact public health . Academic medical center institution capable carry research , however , often lack access minority patient difficulty gain trust able treat . Minority community often report great satisfaction receive care minority provider reluctant receive treatment outside minority healthcare serve system . In general , minority high rate elevate cholesterol , hypertension , cigarette smoking , obesity , metabolic syndrome , diabetes . Other behavioral , environmental , occupational risk factor cardiovascular disease , sleep problem also common among minorties . These risk factor contribute excess CVD morbidity mortality . Heart failure ( HF ) also major public health problem . The impact HF minority population , Native Hawaiians Pacific people , unknown . Native Hawaiians know high rate risk factor HF one high rate CVD mortality U.S . The cause minority health disparity complex understood completely . Although evidence genetic , biologic , environmental factor well document , poor outcome also attribute incomplete treatment . Such treatment may due limited access health care , case , break-down medical system failure physician and/or patient allow optimal health care , even access impair . The complex interaction behavior , socio-economic status ( SES ) , culture , ethnicity important predictor health outcome source health disparity . Despite effort elucidate genetic environmental risk factor promote cardiovascular health high-risk population , trend CVD outcomes suggest CVD health disparity continue widen . The Partnerships Program Reduce Cardiovascular Health Disparities involve collaboration research-intensive medical center ( RIMCs ) track record NIH-supported research patient care minority healthcare serve system ( MSSs ) lack strong research program . Each Partnership Program design carry multiple interdisciplinary research project investigate complex biologic , behavioral , societal factor contribute CVD health disparity facilitate clinical research within MSS . The aim improve CVD outcomes reduce health disparity . Additionally , program provide reciprocal educational skill development program train investigator conduct research aim reduce cardiovascular disparity , thereby enhance research opportunity enrich cultural sensitivity cardiovascular research capability institution . The Request Applications Partnership Programs Reduce Cardiovascular Disparities release September , 2003 . The award make September , 2004 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : To address heart failure disparity among native Hawaiians Pacific people , partnership program , HF Disparities Program ( HFD ) , establish Queen Emma Clinic ( QEC ) Department Native Hawaiian Health . Partners HFD Program include tha following : MedStar Research Institute , Oahu-based Community Health Centers ( CHCs ) , Hawaii EXPORT Center , NIH-funded initiative address diabetes-associated disparity native Hawaiians Pacific people . The HFD Program address follow aim : determine reliability validity echocardiogram perform community-based health worker compare professionally trained sonographer `` gold standard '' ; determine culturally competent educational program heart failure reduce HF hospitalization mortality compare usual care ; characterize ethnic difference HF syndrome hospitalize native Hawaiians Pacific people compare Caucasians ; construct HF pedigrees use probands identify Queen Emma Clinic future HF linkage study native Hawaiians Pacific people ; educate community-based health worker perform echocardiography scan detection HF high risk population native Hawaiians Pacific people ; train new investigator conduct research focus CVD disparity general , HF particular . By achieve aim , HFD Program improve access HF care Community Health Centers serve native Hawaiians Pacific people , fill gap knowledge CVD disparity native Hawaiians Pacific people , provide foundation future study genetic determinant HF .</detailed_description>
