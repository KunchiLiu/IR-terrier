	<brief_summary>This study design determine whether use oxandrolone , anabolic steroid , heal pressure ulcer person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . In Feasibility Study , three VA SCI Units screen randomize patient treatment oxandrolone placebo . Eleven sit screen patient determine eligibility treat patient agent . Following Feasibility Study , sit participate blind , randomize treatment study . A total 400 patient enrolled four-year period . Any patient participating unit chronic SCI difficult-to-heal pelvic ulcer eligible study entry criterion meet . All enrol patient follow period 24 week determine whether target pressure ulcer heal . Those heal follow additional four week determine whether ulcer remain heal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxandrolone Heal Pressure Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective determine whether SCI inpatient chronic Stage III IV pressure ulcer pelvic region randomize receive 24 week optimize clinical care oral anabolic steroid agent ( oxandrolone ) great percent heal pressure ulcer receive placebo optimize clinical care . The major secondary objective determine whether healed pressure ulcer remain heal least 8 week . Subjects register 4 week screen phase follow weekly photo ulcer heal less 30 % ( day 1 photo day 28 photo ) standard clinical care , introduce treatment phase ( randomize ) follow another 24 week either oxandrolone placebo . Wounds heal ( remain close least 96 hour ) subject 2 four week follow visit . Criteria enter screen phase simple : either gender , age 18 year old , inpatient SCI equivalent spinal cord damage least 1 Stage III IV ( indicate severe wound , &lt; 260cm2 ) pressure ulcer pelvic region . September 2006 - year one report submit approved Central Office . Plan add 3 site next year . January 2007 - site # 16 ( San Antonio ) approve Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Central Office invite .</detailed_description>
