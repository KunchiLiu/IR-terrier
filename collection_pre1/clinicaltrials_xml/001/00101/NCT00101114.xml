	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give sorafenib interferon alfa work treat patient metastatic unresectable kidney cancer . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Interferon alfa may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth kidney cancer . Sorafenib may help interferon alfa work well make tumor cell sensitive drug</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Interferon Alfa Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response ( confirmed complete partial response ) patient advance renal cell cancer treat combination BAY-43-9006 interferon alfa-2b . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess probability treatment failure 6 month median overall survival group patient . II . To evaluate quantitative qualitative toxicity regimen . III . To investigate preliminary manner association tumor response measure increase signal Ras-Raf pathway ( p-MAPK , p-JNK , p-p38 , p-AKT ) , VHL gene status , whether change level IL-6 tumor marker hypoxia include PAI-1 , VEGF , osteopontin correspond clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 interferon alfa subcutaneously day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 22 , 24 , 26 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
