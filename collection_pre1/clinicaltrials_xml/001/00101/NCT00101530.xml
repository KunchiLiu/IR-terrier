	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While great progress reduce CVD morbidity mortality United States past 40 year , minority group share fully progress continue low life expectancy high CVD morbidity . On average , minorities less access medical care , receive less aggressive care fewer diagnostic therapeutic cardiac procedure , adhere poorly prescribe medical regimen . Thus , research reduce health disparity improve CVD outcome minorities offer potential substantial positive public heath impact . Academic medical center institution capable carry research , however , often lack access trust minority patient . Minority patient often receive fragment care lack access regular medical care , present emergency department rather primary care physician complication advance chronic CVD condition , less likely follow medical regimen . Minority community often harbor distrust clinical research . Minority patient report great satisfaction receive care minority provider reluctant receive treatment outside minority health care serve system . In general , minority high rate hypertension , elevate cholesterol , cigarette smoking , obesity , metabolic syndrome , diabetes well behavioral , environmental , occupational risk factor cardiovascular disease , sleep problem - element contribute excess CVD morbidity mortality . The cause minority health disparity complex incompletely understood . Although evidence genetic , biologic , environmental factor well document , poor outcome also attribute undertreatment . Such undertreatment may due limited access health care , case , breakdown medical system , failure physician and/or patient allow optimal health care , even access impair . The complex interaction behavior , socioeconomic status ( SES ) , culture , ethnicity important predictor health outcome source health disparity . Despite effort elucidate genetic environmental risk factor promote cardiovascular health high-risk population , trend CVD outcomes suggest CVD health disparity continue widen . The Partnerships Program Reduce Cardiovascular Health Disparities involve collaboration research-intensive medical center ( RIMCs ) record NIH-supported research patient care minority health care serve system ( MSSs ) lack strong research program . Each Partnership Program ( ) design carry multiple interdisciplinary research project investigate complex biological , behavioral , societal factor contribute CVD health disparity facilitate clinical research within MSS improve CVD outcomes reduce health disparity ( b ) provide reciprocal educational skill development program investigator able conduct research aim reduce cardiovascular disparity thereby enhance research opportunity enrich cultural sensitivity cardiovascular research capability institution . The Request Applications Partnership Programs Reduce Cardiovascular Disparities release September 2003 . The award make September 2004 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study develop partnership Denver Health ( DH ) , MSS , University Colorado Health Sciences Center ( UCHSC ) , RIMC . The first specific aim project develop evaluate interactive computer-based tool improve community-based recognition cardiovascular risk factor improve self-management skill , include adherence clinic visit . The tool culturally sensitive bilingual . The second specific aim test ability nurse-based disease management program improve control risk factor . Under aim , DH 's unique computerize information system use develop registry patient hypertension characterize patient ' overall risk CVD risk nonadherent behavior . A randomized clinical trial use assess impact nurse-based disease management intervention high risk history nonadherence . The intervention base program already place DH modify response input community-based focus group . Specific aim 3 4 seek refine current cardiovascular risk profile way specific Hispanics . Specific aim 3 ass ethnic difference relationship traditional risk factor ( diabetes , hypertension , smoking , hyperlipidemia ) preclinical marker cardiovascular disease ( left ventricular mass , carotid intima medium thickness , brachial artery reactivity ) time . Specific aim 4 ass relationship among traditional risk factor , preclinical marker , panel circulate inflammatory marker . Also specific aim 4 , randomize , placebo-controlled trial ass efficacy `` statin '' medication reduce circulate level inflammatory marker . Specific aim 5 6 develop educational program increase cultural proficiency clinical researcher , increase minority researcher participation cardiovascular prevention research , assist junior DH physician develop research career cardiovascular prevention .</detailed_description>
