	<brief_title>Lapatinib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Biliary Tract Liver Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The goal study determine objective response rate GW572016 patient biliary cancer hepatocellular cancer ( HCC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall survival patient enter onto study . II . Quantitative qualitative toxicity patient population treat GW572016 . III . Determine progression free survival patient . IV . To perform molecular pharmacogenomic correlative study identify specific patient subset benefit GW572016 therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord tumor site ( biliary tree cancer [ include ampullary , bile duct , gall bladder cancer ] vs hepatocellular cancer ) . Patients receive oral lapatinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow survival .</detailed_description>
