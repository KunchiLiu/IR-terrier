	<brief_title>Anti-CD20 Antibody Therapy Sjogren 's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SS second common autoimmune disease ; cause immune cell attack destroy gland produce tear saliva , occurs often woman men . Currently , establish disease-modifying treatment SS . Traditional treatment strategy SS primarily address dryness symptom . Rituximab target CD20 antigen surface B cell , approve 1997 treatment patient low-grade follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . In small study , rituximab also show relieve symptom rheumatoid arthritis . Because SS associate development B cell-related cancer rituximab potential treat autoimmune disease , rituximab may alleviate symptom SS . This study evaluate safety rituximab people SS . This study last 1 year . At 4 2 week start study , patient undergo medical medication history assessment , physical exam , blood urine collection , rheumatologic evaluation , eye exam , salivary gland test . The screen visit 4 week study start also include electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , chest x-ray , tuberculosis exam . Patients receive IV rituximab study entry Week 2 ; blood collection occur prior infusion post-infusion pharmacokinetics study . There 6 follow-up study visit occur Weeks 4 , 8 , 14 , 26 , 30 , 52 . Blood urine collection ; physical exam ; rheumatologic evaluation ; eye , skin , salivary gland test occur select study visit .</detailed_description>
