	<brief_summary>The transition hospital home high-risk period patient 's illness . Poor communication healthcare provider hospital discharge common contribute adverse event affect patient discharge . The importance good communication discharge increase primary care provider delegate inpatient care hospitalists . Any process improve information transfer among provider discharge might improve health safety patient discharge U.S. hospital year , appreciably reduce unnecessary healthcare expenditures . Information transfer among healthcare provider patient undermined inaccuracy , omission , illegibility , logistical failure ( e.g. , information never deliver ) , delay generation ( i.e. , dictation transcription ) transmission . Root cause include recall error , increase physician workload , interface failure ( e.g. , physician-clerical ) poor training physician discharge process . Many deficiency current process information transfer hospital discharge could effectively addressed application information technology . The propose study measure value software application facilitate information transfer hospital discharge . The study design compare benefit discharge health information technology versus usual care high-risk patient recently discharge acute care hospitalization . The design randomize , single-blind , controlled trial . The outcomes readmission within 6 month , adverse event , effectiveness satisfaction discharge process patient physician perspective .

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The study design compare benefit discharge health information technology versus usual care high-risk patient recently discharge acute care hospitalization . STUDY HYPOTHESES : The primary efficacy endpoint proportion patient readmitted least within 6 month index admission . Readmission reason include observation status full admission status . Primary hypothesis : Among high-risk patient recently discharge acute care hospitalization , significant decrease primary efficacy endpoint patient receive discharge health information technology versus usual care discharge instruction . Secondary hypothesis 1A : In patient population , time first readmission great patient receive discharge health information technology versus usual care discharge instruction . Secondary hypothesis 1B : In patient population , mean number hospital day per patient within 6 month index hospital discharge low patient receive discharge health information technology versus usual care discharge instruction . Secondary hypothesis 2 : In patient population , mean score effectiveness satisfaction discharge process great patient receive discharge health information technology versus usual care discharge instruction . Secondary hypothesis 3 : In patient population , proportion patient report pharmacist need clarify discharge prescription low patient receive discharge health information technology versus usual care discharge instruction . Secondary hypothesis 4 : In patient population , proportion patient least one adverse event within 4 week hospital discharge lower patient receive discharge health information technology versus usual care discharge instruction . Secondary hypothesis 5 : In population , mean satisfaction score drug information high patient receive discharge health information technology versus usual care discharge instruction . Secondary hypothesis 6 : Among primary care physician provide post-discharge care high-risk patient , mean score discharge process effectiveness satisfaction great patient receive discharge health information technology versus usual care discharge instruction . Secondary hypothesis 7 : Among hospitalist physician discharge high-risk patient , mean score physician ' satisfaction discharge process great physician assign discharge health information technology versus usual care discharge instruction . METHODS : The trial design randomize cluster , single-blind ( outcome assessor blind ) , control trial . The study design conforms recent guideline randomize controlled trial . The test intervention discharge application health information technology . The control intervention usual care ( hand-written discharge instruction ) describe . Each patient remain study 6 month . Enrollment study last approximately 18 month . There interim analysis . Research personnel obtain informed consent potentially eligible inpatient . Informed consent patient occur screen visit . Screening visit : Investigators train research personnel perform screen informed consent . The screen visit may occur within 2 day plan discharge . After obtain informed consent , research personnel record item baseline assessment . Research personnel ask patient self-rated health , coronary artery disease ( include angina pectoris myocardial infarction ) , diabetes mellitus past year , hospitalization past year , number doctor visit past year , presence informal caregiver able care patient several day , age , gender . The screening questionnaire validate . Research personnel calculate PRA score screen visit . PRA score 0.5 define high-risk patient 50 % probability admit hospital two time within 4 year . When PRA score apply Medicaid beneficiary follow one year , 57 % patient PRA 0.5 least one hospital admission 0.99 +/- 0.24 hospital admission per person-year survive ( mean +/- SE ) . Research personnel offer informed consent patient PRA score 0.4 . Research personnel record limit information patient ineligible refuse consent . Baseline Assessment : The baseline assessment occur inform consent discharge . The ten-point clock test use screen instrument orientation . Research personnel record patient 's name , address , age , state race , gender , discharge medication prescription . Research personnel record patient contact information alternate contact information order perform post-hospital telephone interview require protocol . Intervention allocation : The time random treatment allocation baseline assessment discharge . Patients receive study treatment fail consent fail inclusion/exclusion criterion . Treatment assignment 1:1 ratio either discharge application health information technology usual care discharge instruction . The unit randomization hospitalist physician performs discharge process . The randomization process design assure random allocation cluster cluster determine discharge physician . Allocation concealment possible since enrolled patient discharge hospitalist physician receive study intervention . Dispense patient logbook : The purpose patient logbook promote ascertainment study endpoint . Patient telephone interview : discharge process effectiveness satisfaction The purpose first telephone interview acquire data measure secondary endpoint 2 , 3 , 5 . One week ( 5 9 day ) hospital discharge date , research personnel perform telephone interview patient . Interviewers instruct patient avoid mention random intervention assignment . To address secondary hypothesis 2 , interview question follow PREPARED text . The PREPARED instrument survey four key process domain : information exchange ( community service equipment ) , medication management , preparation cop discharge control discharge circumstance . The question PREPARED measure patient 's overall satisfaction discharge , whether equipment community service need met , use health service health related cost post-discharge . The telephone interviewer ask patient pharmacist call doctor attempt fill discharge prescription . The purpose question pharmacist address secondary hypothesis 3 . The telephone interviewer ask question Satisfaction Information Medicines Scale ( SIMS ) . The SIMS 17-item survey internal consistency test-retest reliability . The SIMS survey instrument address secondary hypothesis 5 . Primary care physician questionnaire : discharge process effectiveness satisfaction . The primary care physician questionnaire address secondary hypothesis 6 . Within 10 18 day hospital discharge date , research personnel contact primary care physician perform survey . Patient interview : adverse event assessment . The purpose second patient interview address secondary hypothesis 4 . Approximately 4 week ( 20 40 day ) index hospital discharge date , research physician personnel perform telephone interview patient . Physicians trained assess adverse event perform telephone interview . Interviewers instruct patient avoid mention random intervention assignment . The interview tool modification validate survey instrument . Hospitalist ( discharge ) physician questionnaire : The purpose survey address secondary hypothesis 7 . Patient interview : readmission assessment . The purpose third patient interview ascertain primary endpoint , secondary endpoint ( 1A , 1B ) , tertiary endpoint . Approximately 6 month ( 170 190 day ) hospital discharge date , research personnel blind intervention assignment perform telephone interview patient . Interviewers instruct patient avoid mention random intervention assignment . Interviewers ask patient consult patient logbook answer question . Interviewers record admission hospital , date admission , duration hospital stay , number outpatient physician visit , number emergency department visit result hospital admission . Guess treatment assignment blind observer : The purpose guess measure effectiveness blind . Conditions Early Withdrawal Treatment : Patients may terminate study intervention time return standard care withdraw consent . If patient withdraws study reason , research personnel conduct end-of-study visit . Sample size determination : The primary analysis difference proportion patient two study group achieve primary efficacy endpoint readmission within 6 month discharge . The estimated event rate standard therapy group 37 % , control group event rate systematic review randomize controlled trial discharge intervention . The minimum clinically relevant difference , 13 % , correspond standardized increment 28.2 % empirical boundary quantitative significance . The required sample size primary analysis 275 patient group assign discharge application health information technology 275 patient group assign control ( usual care ) therapy . In previous study discharge planning , investigator enrol 28 % ( 363/1296 ) potentially eligible patient . In study , 72 % ( 262/363 ) enrol patient complete 6-month assessment . Our hospitalist service discharge 297 patient per month . We estimate screen 5456 patient within 18.37 month . We estimate 50 % screen patient potentially eligible accord Pra criterion . Among potentially eligible patient , estimate 28 % consent study enrollment . Therefore , number enrol patient 5456 x 50 % x 28 % = 764 . We estimate 72 % ( 550/764 ) enrol patient continue study 6-month assessment . After 3 month patient enrollment , find rate enrollment low achieve require sample size . In 2005 , request receive approval Agency Healthcare Research Quality Institutional Review Board low patient inclusion criterion , probability repeat admission ( PRA ) , 0.50 0.40 .</detailed_description>
