	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While great progress reduce CVD morbidity mortality U.S. past 40 year , minority group share fully progress continue low life expectancy high CVD morbidity . On average , minorities less access medical care , receive less aggressive care fewer diagnostic therapeutic cardiac procedure , adhere poorly prescribe medical regimen . Thus , research reduce health disparity improve CVD outcome minorities offer potential substantial positive public heath impact . Academic medical center institution capable carry research , however , often lack access trust minority patient . Minority patient often receive fragment care lack access regular medical care , present emergency department rather primary care physician complication advance chronic CVD condition , less likely follow medical regimen . Minority community often harbor distrust clinical research . Minority patient report great satisfaction receive care minority provider reluctant receive treatment outside minority healthcare serve system . In general , minority high rate hypertension , elevate cholesterol , cigarette smoking , obesity , metabolic syndrome , diabetes , well behavioral , environmental , occupational risk factor cardiovascular disease , sleep problem - element contribute excess CVD morbidity mortality . The cause minority health disparity complex incompletely understood . Although evidence genetic , biologic , environmental factor well document , poor outcome also attribute under-treatment . Such under-treatment may due limited access health care , case , break-down medical system , failure physician and/or patient allow optimal health care , even access impair . The complex interaction behavior , socio-economic status ( SES ) , culture , ethnicity important predictor health outcome source health disparity . Despite effort elucidate genetic environmental risk factor promote cardiovascular health high-risk population , trend CVD outcomes suggest CVD health disparity continue widen . The Partnerships Program Reduce Cardiovascular Health Disparities involve collaboration research-intensive medical center ( RIMCs ) track record NIH-supported research patient care minority healthcare serve system ( MSSs ) lack strong research program . Each Partnership Program : ) design carry multiple interdisciplinary research project investigate complex biological , behavioral , societal factor contribute CVD health disparity facilitate clinical research within MSS improve CVD outcomes reduce health disparity , b ) provide reciprocal educational skill development program investigator able conduct research aim reduce cardiovascular disparity thereby enhance research opportunity , enrich cultural sensitivity , improve cardiovascular research capability institution . The Request Applications Partnership Programs Reduce Cardiovascular Disparities release September 2003 . The award make September 2004 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Over past decade , explosive increase obesity among age group within U.S. population . This epidemic particularly problematic among African Americans Southeast . Although genetic factor play contributory role , postulate ethnic disparity obesity obesity-related CVD related dynamic interplay biological factor behavioral response unique environmental context within ethnic community . Obesity often associate perturbation metabolic physiologic milieu . A cluster obesity-related abnormality define `` Metabolic Syndrome '' . The CVD complication obesity appear related capacity adipose tissue generate `` adipokines '' directly predispose insulin-resistance , endothelial dysfunction , inflammation , vascular disease . The study use state-of-the-art approach define potential ethnic difference profile metabolic , physiologic , biochemical feature associate obesity well salutary response lifestyle modification . The program use multi-disciplinary strategy systematically characterize potential ethnic difference obesity-related CVD draw upon field psychology , physiology , biochemistry , nursing , clinical medicine . In thematic series inter-related study , program 's research plan range epidemiology study within ethnic community , patient-centered clinical trial intervention within ethnic community practice , analysis novel biomarkers human pathobiology . This collaborative multi-investigator team build upon complementary partnership Morehouse School Medicine Emory University . This partnership share joint commitment address strike ethnic disparity high-risk CVD population . The specific aim : 1 ) define relative influence psychosocial/cultural factor biological mediator determinant ethnic disparity obesity metabolic syndrome population-based bi-racial cohort ; 2 ) define effectiveness patient-targeted behavioral intervention enhance health African American patient Metabolic Syndrome context community-based clinical practice ; 3 ) ass impact innovative lifestyle intervention strategy conventional novel biomarkers vascular disease risk African Americans ; 4 ) enhance education/training fellows/practitioners engage CVD disparity research/practice promote partnership enhance cardiovascular health within ethnic community .</detailed_description>
