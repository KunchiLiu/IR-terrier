	<brief_summary>Conventional rehabilitation restore normal , safe gait many stroke survivor . Functional neuromuscular stimulation ( FNS ) use intramuscular ( IM ) electrodes ( FNS-IM ) improve persistent gait deficit patient chronic stroke ( 1-7 year post stroke ) , require long protocol 6-18 month . For chronic deficit , shorten response treatment ( 3 month ) obtain combine FNS-IM body weight-supported treadmill training ( BWSTT ) . Gains include strength , coordination , gait kinematics , walk endurance , quality life . Gait deficit treat chronic phase resistant treatment early recovery phase , chronic , abnormal movement pattern ingrain .

Hypothesis I : FNS-IM + BWSTT restore volitional gait completely subject early recovery phase follow stroke , compare BWSTT alone . Subjects admit 1-11 month stroke . Thirty five subject randomize one two treatment group . They treat 48 session , four sessions/week . Primary outcome measure : kinematic swing phase gait component , energy cost gait , index walk endurance . Secondary outcome measure kinematic stance phase gait component gait speed . The second set hypothesis test relationship restoration mobility measurement impairment , function quality life . Additionally , co-variates assess entry study : gender , age , mood , co-morbidities , time since stroke , week prior rehabilitation . Data outcome measure collect week 1 , 6 , 12 , 6 month end treatment . For Hypothesis I test , contrast make two treatment group . A separate regression model analyze outcome measure . The post-test score give primary outcome measure serve dependent variable regression model . The two independent variable treatment assignment information ( dichotomous variable ) pretest score give outcome measure ( covariate ) . In additional model analysis second set hypothesis , relationship ascertain mobility restoration impairment , function , quality life . Mobility deficits follow stroke pose significant economic , social , psychological hardship individual society . Development technique improve low extremity function improve quality life reduce associate health care cost patient stroke . The result propose study potential provide new acute stroke treatment increase rate recovery , produce comprehensive recovery motor function , safe gait , great functional independence , enhance quality life .</detailed_description>
