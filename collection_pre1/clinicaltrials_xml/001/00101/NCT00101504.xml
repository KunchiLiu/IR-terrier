	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While great progress reduce CVD morbidity mortality U.S. past 40 year , minority group share fully progress continue low life expectancy high CVD morbidity . On average , minorities less access medical care , receive less aggressive care fewer diagnostic therapeutic cardiac procedure , adhere poorly prescribe medical regimen . Thus , research reduce health disparity improve CVD outcome minorities offer potential substantial positive public heath impact . Academic medical center institution capable carry research , however , often lack access trust minority patient . Minority patient often receive fragment care lack access regular medical care , present emergency department rather primary care physician complication advance chronic CVD condition , less likely follow medical regimen . Minority community often harbor distrust clinical research . Minority patient report great satisfaction receive care minority provider reluctant receive treatment outside minority healthcare serve system . In general , minority high rate hypertension , elevate cholesterol , cigarette smoking , obesity , metabolic syndrome , diabetes , well behavioral , environmental , occupational risk factor cardiovascular disease , sleep problem - element contribute excess CVD morbidity mortality . The cause minority health disparity complex incompletely understood . Although evidence genetic , biologic , environmental factor well document , poor outcome also attribute under-treatment . Such under-treatment may due limited access health care , case , break-down medical system , failure physician and/or patient allow optimal health care , even access impair . The complex interaction behavior , socio-economic status ( SES ) , culture , ethnicity important predictor health outcome source health disparity . Despite effort elucidate genetic environmental risk factor promote cardiovascular health high-risk population , trend CVD outcomes suggest CVD health disparity continue widen . The Partnerships Program Reduce Cardiovascular Health Disparities involve collaboration research-intensive medical center ( RIMCs ) track record NIH-supported research patient care minority healthcare serve system ( MSSs ) lack strong research program . Each Partnership Program : ) design carry multiple interdisciplinary research project investigate complex biological , behavioral , societal factor contribute CVD health disparity facilitate clinical research within MSS improve CVD outcomes reduce health disparity , b ) provide reciprocal educational skill development program investigator able conduct research aim reduce cardiovascular disparity thereby enhance research opportunity , enrich cultural sensitivity , improve cardiovascular research capability institution . The Request Applications Partnership Programs Reduce Cardiovascular Disparities release September 2003 . The award make September 2004 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The University Mississippi Medical Center ( Research Intensive Medical Center ) Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center ( Minority Healthcare Serving System ) address cardiovascular health disparity among African Americans establishment HEAT Partnership . HEAT acronym Hypertension Education Treatment . The HEAT Partnership organize four core . The administrative core include principal investigator RIMC MSS well core director co-directors . Specific aim Research Core : ( 1 ) provide series workshop healthcare provider focus assessment treatment hypertensive patient accord current guideline ; ( 2 ) enroll sufficient number patient uncontrolled hypertension participate study encourage continue treatment throughout duration intervention mean promote lifetime hypertension control ; ( 3 ) provide program patient education include ( ) series workshops intervention participant focus impact hypertension , efficacy proper diet exercise manage hypertension ; ( b ) patient advocate , serve liaison patient provider ; ( c ) `` health partner '' patient 's social circle acquaintance help reinforce workshop lesson participatory manner ; ( 4 ) compare result intervention group control group , determine effectiveness intervention . Specific aims Education Core : ( 1 ) enhance cultural competency among healthcare provider address impact health disparity among nation 's racial ethnic minority population ; ( 2 ) explore issue race , racism , health disparity research medical care , particularly affect African Americans Mississippi ; ( 3 ) provide career development train new investigator capable conduct research reduce cardiovascular health disparity . Specific aim Community Outreach Core : ( 1 ) conduct focus group session select vulnerable population assess level awareness hypertension identify realistic lifestyle hypertension-prevention goal intend audience ; ( 2 ) pursue partnership community-based organization enhance activity Outreach Core ; ( 3 ) develop disseminate culturally linguistically appropriate education material lay public hypertension , include detection , diagnosis , strategy prevention .
