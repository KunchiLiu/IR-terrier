	<brief_title>Improving Cardiovascular Treatment Approaches Among Minorities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While great progress reduce CVD morbidity mortality U.S. past 40 year , minority group share fully progress continue low life expectancy high CVD morbidity . On average , minorities less access medical care , receive less aggressive care fewer diagnostic therapeutic cardiac procedure , adhere poorly prescribe medical regimen . Thus , research reduce health disparity improve CVD outcome minorities offer potential substantial positive public heath impact . Academic medical center institution capable carry research , however , often lack access trust minority patient . Minority patient often receive fragment care lack access regular medical care , present emergency department rather primary care physician complication advance chronic CVD condition , less likely follow medical regimen . Minority community often harbor distrust clinical research . Minority patient report great satisfaction receive care minority provider reluctant receive treatment outside minority healthcare serve system . In general , minority high rate hypertension , elevate cholesterol , cigarette smoking , obesity , metabolic syndrome , diabetes , well behavioral , environmental , occupational risk factor cardiovascular disease , sleep problem . These element contribute excess CVD morbidity mortality . The cause minority health disparity complex incompletely understood . Although evidence genetic , biologic , environmental factor well document , poor outcome also attribute under-treatment . Such under-treatment may due limited access health care , case , break-down medical system , failure physician and/or patient allow optimal health care , even access impair . The complex interaction behavior , socio-economic status ( SES ) , culture , ethnicity important predictor health outcome source health disparity . Despite effort elucidate genetic environmental risk factor promote cardiovascular health high-risk population , trend CVD outcomes suggest CVD health disparity continue widen . The Partnerships Program Reduce Cardiovascular Health Disparities involve collaboration minority healthcare serve system ( MSSs ) lack strong research program research-intensive medical center ( RIMCs ) track record NIH-supported research patient care . Each Partnership Program : ) design carry multiple interdisciplinary research project investigate complex biological , behavioral , societal factor contribute CVD health disparity facilitate clinical research within MSS improve CVD outcomes reduce health disparity , b ) provide reciprocal educational skill development program investigator able conduct research aim reduce cardiovascular disparity , thereby enhance research opportunity enrich cultural sensitivity cardiovascular research capability institution . The Request Applications Partnership Programs Reduce Cardiovascular Disparities release September 2003 . The award make September 2004 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The collaborative partnership Bon Secours Baltimore Health System ( BSBHS ) University Maryland Baltimore ( UMB ) seek improve provider patient approach treatment hypertension diabetes , respectively . UMB also aim modify physician-related barrier minority enrollment clinical trial , BSBHS improve patient adherence treatment plan . Through didactic training , UMB aim build sustainable research program BSBHS ; cultural sensitivity training , BSBHS expect enhance disparity program UMB . The relative impact physician and/or patient intervention control hypertension diabetes assess . This hypothesis-testing , prospective study , experimental 2 X 2 factorial design ; four-arm randomized control trial . Outcomes include adherence improved knowledge/awareness guideline ( patient physician ) , well patient clinical quality life measure . The study power proportion patient attain set goal . There target enrollment 800 patient ( 400 hypertension diabetes ) , afford 80 % ( 90 % ) power allow 25 % attrition . Logistic regression use probability reach goal , multiple linear regression use relative change mmHg ( hypertension ) HbAlc ( diabetes ) , survival analysis use model time reach goal . Measurements take improved adherence diabetes patient result BSBHS actively identify access barrier . Measurements also take change willingness patient enroll clinical trial result physician-targeted education . The study seek demonstrate best practice model , base collaborative partnership , build self-sustained research program BSBHS enhance cardiovascular disparity program UMB . Community entities full access resource institution , turn access invaluable input support community group .</detailed_description>
