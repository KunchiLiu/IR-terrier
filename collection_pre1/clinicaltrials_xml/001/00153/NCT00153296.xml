	<brief_title>Study Efficacy Carbamazepine Therapy Patients With Moderate Persistent Severe Bronchial Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective therapy asthma still remain quite serious problem . According GINA definition , asthma inflammatory disorder . Consequently , modern pharmacotherapy asthma provide wide use anti-inflammatory drug . But asthma also paroxysmal disorder : many specialist even guideline underline paroxysmal clinical picture asthma . Besides , accord author , neurogenic inflammation may play important role asthma mechanism . But neurogenic inflammatory paroxysmal disorder exist , migraine trigeminal neuralgia . Some antiepileptic drug , like carbamazepine valproate , effective therapy migraine trigeminal neuralgia - 80 % case . If bronchial asthma also paroxysmal inflammatory disease , like migraine trigeminal neuralgia , possible antiepileptic drug also effective asthma therapy . We perform double-blind , placebo-controlled 3-month trial evaluation carbamazepine efficacy therapy bronchial asthma . Carbamazepine well-known , comparatively safe effective antiepileptic drug .
