	<detailed_description>Primary Objective • To evaluate objective response rate ( CR + PR ) bortezomib alone patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma . Secondary Objectives - To evaluate tolerability toxicity . - To evaluate time progression . - To assess frequency severity peripheral neuropathy . - To evaluate impact early intervention dose modification explore symptomatic treatment peripheral neuropathy . Exploratory Objectives • To perform pharmacogenomic analysis molecular marker associate response non-response . Statistical Design A one stage design use evaluate ORR . With 60 evaluable participant , least 27 objective response observe bortezomib consider promising . The probability conclude treatment promise &gt; 0.95 true ORR 55 % &lt; 0.07 true ORR 35 % .</detailed_description>
