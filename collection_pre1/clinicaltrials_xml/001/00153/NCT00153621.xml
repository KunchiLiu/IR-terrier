	<brief_summary>Among adult Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) , Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) previously report occur approximately 10 % child HIV-infection . The frequency CKD , cause , natural history child adolescents HIV-infection systematically study , particularly era new anti-retroviral medication . The primary aim study determine common pediatric HIV-infected individual evidence persistent proteinuria CKD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infection significant cause pediatric morbidity mortality since first identify early 1980s . In 1997 , HIV become fourth lead cause death among child 1 4 year age . As December 2001 , 9,074 child age 13 year diagnosed AIDS United States territory , additional 3,923 child HIV-infection age 13 year . Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infection AIDS affect child equally United States . Whereas white comprise 61 % pediatric population , represent 15-20 % child HIV AIDS . In contrast , African-Americans account 14 % US pediatric population , represent 60-65 % child HIV AIDS . The prevalence rate AIDS among African-American child 2001 14 time great among white child , 7 time higher among Hispanic child . A variety renal , electrolyte , acid-base disturbance describe patient HIV-infection . These abnormality may associate HIV-infection , opportunistic infection , antiviral medication , unrelated primary disorder . Proteinuria may serve early indicator HIV-associated nephropathy ( HIVAN ) , pathologic renal lesion associate HIV-infection . Autopsy data adult HIV-infection AIDS demonstrate prevalence HIVAN 1 15 % . The prevalence HIVAN pediatric population report 7 15 % . The racial disparity see AIDS population also describe pediatric HIVAN population . Reports HIVAN pediatric population find 137 155 child ( 89 % ) Miami , Florida 208 217 child ( 96 % ) Washington , DC African-American . The medical progress make treatment HIV infection highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) lead dramatic decline incidence death among adults HIV-infection . By 1999 , however , HIV become third leading cause end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) among African-Americans age 20 64 year . In contrast decline incidence HIV-infection adult population , incidence ESRD due HIVAN decrease much slow unknown reason . The incidence pediatric AIDS case also decline past decade , 952 new case diagnose 1992 101 2001 . The impact decline incidence pediatric AIDS case upon incidence pediatric HIVAN remain unknown . The progression pediatric HIVAN appear occur slowly adult HIVAN population , mean time initial diagnosis HIVAN ESRD 8 20 month . Mortality high pediatric HIV-infected population , nearly 80 % pediatric patient HIVAN die . For study , seek estimate prevalence CKD HIV-infected patient overall within specific racial group . Participants screen first-morning macroscopic urinalysis detection proteinuria , semi-quantitative measurement proteinuria use urine protein-to-creatinine urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio . Those patient proteinuria great equal 1+ first-morning macrourinalysis , urine protein-to-creatinine ratio &gt; 0.20 urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio &gt; 30 mcg/mg creatinine , repeat first-morning macroscopic urinalysis , urine protein-to-creatinine urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio perform 3 month later . Prior obtain urine sample , participant take angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) therapy anti-proteinuric anti-hypertensive effect discontinue medication 2 week prior urine sample collection . After collect first-morning urine sample , study participant may resume his/her prior ACEI ARB previously prescribe dose schedule . Those patient fix proteinuria first-morning macroscopic urinalysis 2 occasion separate 3 month refer Pediatric Nephrology Clinic evaluation proteinuria and/or CKD . The calculated GFR determine use recent serum creatinine patient height medical record use Schwartz formula . Chronic Kidney Disease define , NKF KDOQI guideline .</detailed_description>
