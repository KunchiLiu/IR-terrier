	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Efficacy Dronabinol ( Marinol ) Add-On Therapy Patients Opioids Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During informed consent process subject inform Marinol ( Dronabinol ) generally use chronic pain provision extend treatment Dronabinol . The study comprise two phase , blind single-dose phase open-label multi-dose phase . There five visit ; one baseline visit , three treatment visit single-dose phase , final end-of-study visit multi-dose phase . Subjects initially screen telephone , eligible present baseline visit . This visit verify enrollment criterion , include history physical exam , urine pregnancy test indicate , baseline assessment . Subjects meet full enrollment criterion randomly allocate one treatment sequence single-dose phase . Single-Dose Phase The treatment sequence randomize 3-treatment , 3-period crossover trial . Each subject receive treatment sequence randomly allocate Investigational Drug Services Department Brigham Women 's Hospital .

Patients receive study drug 8-9 , monitor 8 hour , subsequently discharge home . At 4- 8-hour mark , two blood sample draw . Total amount blood take three sample together less 10 ml . Subjects require rescue dose 8-hour study period take customary rescue analgesic , observe study center ensure achieve adequate relief pain , discharge home . A `` rescue assessment '' complete time rescue dose final assessment treatment session . At end fourth visit ( final treatment visit ) , prior discharge , subject offer entry one-month open-label extension . Multi-Dose Phase Subjects choose enter open-label extension provide Marinol tablet take accord prearrange titration table . Subjects may titrate upwards inadequate analgesia downwards side effect . Subjects must dose minimum two day prior upward titration , may titrate downward time due side effect . Subjects unable tolerate regimen drop study . Subjects require stable dronabinol regimen last week study . Subjects choose terminate early encourage present termination visit . Subjects continue baseline analgesic , include background rescue opioids prior trial . Downward titration opioids allow clinically indicate , per judgment patient investigator .
