	<brief_summary>To test hypothesis immune response 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV-23 ) could improve Alaska Native elder immune prim 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV-7 ) , assess post-vaccination immune response among Natives age 55 year old randomize three arm : ( 1 ) one dose PPV-23 accord current state ACIP recommendation ; ( 2 ) one dose PCV-7 follow two month later dose PPV-23 ; ( 3 ) one dose PCV-7 follow six month later dose PPV-23 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rates invasive pneumococcal infection ( bacteremia meningitis cause Streptococcus pneumoniae ) Alaska Natives among high United States approximately five-fold high rate among non-Natives living Alaska . Disease common among young elderly ( 73 cases/100,000 Natives ≥55 year old ) 1 . Case-fatality pneumococcal infection high ( &gt; 15 % ) among elderly . A 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV-23 ) license United States since 1983 . The CDC Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommend vaccination PPV-23 Alaska Natives age two year old , however Alaska Department Health Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium target fund vaccination age 55 year old . Post-licensure epidemiological study document effectiveness PPV-23 prevention invasive infection ( bacteremia meningitis ) among elderly young adult certain chronic medical condition . The overall effectiveness invasive pneumococcal disease among immunocompetent person age ≥65 year 75 % ; however , efficacy may decrease advance age . PPV-23 several limitation . Efficacy pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine common type pneumococcal infection elderly , bronchitis pneumonia without bacteremia , document control , randomize trial . Additionally , antibody pneumococcal polysaccharide decline immunization often return pre-vaccination concentration within 5 year . A case-control study evaluate vaccine effectiveness suggest decline antibody concentration associate decline protection invasive pneumococcal infection . At present , Alaska Department Health recommend revaccination PPV-23 every 6 year . This contrast ACIP recommendations one revaccination . A retrospective review find similar rate local systemic reaction among 179 Alaska Native elder receive third dose PPV-23 compare 180 receive first second dose . Although available data suggest revaccination PPV-23 safe , clinical benefit revaccination unproven . T-cell independent antigen , polysaccharide , produce booster response revaccination , antibody level revaccination exceed primary immunization . A 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV-7 ) license 2000 ( Prevnar™ , Wyeth Lederle Vaccines ) prevention invasive pneumococcal disease infant young child . This vaccine safe effective prevention invasive pneumococcal disease large randomize trial conduct among infant age two month old enrol northern California HMO . The role pneumococcal conjugate vaccine among adult define . Potential advantage conjugate vaccine compare PPV-23 include T-cell dependent immune response conjugate vaccine lead immunologic memory booster response characterize rapid dramatic increase antibody revaccination . PCV-7 also overcome limitation poorly immunogenic antigen PPV-23 , include resistant antimicrobial drug . An additional potential advantage PCV-7 great mucosal immunity possible protection non-bacteremic pneumococcal respiratory tract infections—a benefit never confirm PPV-23 among elderly . Potential disadvantage PCV-7 adult include limited serotype coverage . Only 50 % invasive pneumococcal infection Alaska Natives age 55 old cause seven serotypes include PCV-7 compare 90 % PPV-23 . Preliminary data study healthy person ≥50 year old patient vaccinate treatment Hodgkin ’ disease indicate antibody response dose pneumococcal conjugate vaccine substantially good response PPV-23 . One approach use conjugate vaccine adult administer conjugate vaccine prime immune system subsequently give dose PPV-23 induce booster response serotypes present vaccine well primary T-cell independent response serotypes PPV-23 . Immunogenicity study document boost polysaccharide vaccine child chronic illness adult Hodgkin ’ Disease primary vaccination pneumococcal conjugate vaccine . However , publish data evaluate strategy prevent pneumococcal disease elderly , data available Alaska Natives . We study immunogenicity PCV-7 Alaska Native elder . Participants randomize three arm : ( 1 ) one dose PPV-23 accord current state ACIP recommendation ; ( 2 ) one dose PCV-7 follow two month later dose PPV-23 ; ( 3 ) one dose PCV-7 follow six month later dose PPV-23 . Immune responses conjugate vaccine pneumococcal serotypes determine enzyme link immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) antibody affinity Centers Disease Control Prevention ’ ( CDC ) Arctic Investigations Program ( AIP ) laboratory locate Alaska Native Medical Center ( ANMC ) campus .</detailed_description>
