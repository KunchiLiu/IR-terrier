	<detailed_description>People peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , important clinical manifestation atherosclerosis , often suffer symptom intermittent claudication impair walk ability adversely affect quality life . People PAD also increase risk adverse cardiovascular event , include myocardial infarction , stroke death . Unfortunately , medical therapy direct functional limb-threatening manifestation limit . Little attention pay biologic process cause PAD , atherogenic mechanism may preferentially affect peripheral circulation . Vascular inflammation insulin resistance two important interdependent condition associate atherosclerosis . Subjects trial ( 160 adult stable intermittent claudication take insulin insulin-sensitizing medication , thiazolidinediones ) randomize placebo-controlled , parallel design manner , atorvastatin 80 mg orally daily ( reduce inflammation ) pioglitazone 45 mg orally daily ( improve insulin sensitivity ) . Forty healthy adult subject , age gender-matched subset study group , enrol serve control population . Primary secondary study endpoint include : treadmill walk time , endothelium-dependent vasodilation , insulin-mediated skeletal muscle glucose uptake .</detailed_description>
