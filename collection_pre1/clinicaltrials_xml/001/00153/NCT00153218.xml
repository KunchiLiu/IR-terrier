This study chart review above-mentioned population capture information ; - chemo hormonal therapy choose clinician Her-2 positive metastatic patient combine trastuzumab - number treatment regimen ( chemo hormonal ) give trastuzumab - clinical outcome patient treat - happen patient cardiac status long term administration trastuzumab - treatment pattern exist management central nervous system metastases This study aim generate hypothesis test information collect analyzed give clinician meaningful data guide treatment decision beyond treatment progression .</detailed_description>
