	<brief_title>A Study Assess Cap-Assisted Colonoscopy Versus Regular Colonoscopy First Repeated Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently consensus improve success rate colonoscopy procedure give fact 10 % procedure may fail . It suggest use variable stiffness colonoscope ( colonoscope shaft stiffness alter ) , even sophisticated magnetic imaging colonoscopy ( colonoscopy perform magnetic position detection sensor ) , could improve success rate . However , kinds equipment either expensive always available daily clinical practice . From recent study show add transparent cap tip colonoscope may improve procedure success rate without increase complication rate procedure . The cost cap cheap available almost every endoscopy center . Therefore cap-assisted colonoscopy method may alternative may improve success rate colonoscopy procedure , reduce pain discomfort related procedure .</detailed_description>
