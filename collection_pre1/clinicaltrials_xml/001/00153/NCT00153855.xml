	<detailed_description>Infants bear prematurely significant risk hemorrhagic ischemic brain injury . Despite improved survival rate among population recent year , form brain injury remain frequent considerable consequence . Periventricular leukomalacia ( PVL ) , disease characterize necrosis cerebral white matter characteristic distribution , one common type brain injury see premature infant . MRI technology allow well anatomical resolution result improvement diagnostic accuracy . The current standard practice perform routine MRI examination premature infant , routine perform surveillance brain image child leave NICU . In 2002 Practice Parameter neuroimaging neonate , American Academy Neurology Practice Committee Child Neurology Society acknowledge superiority MRI detection brain lesion premature infant , fall short recommend routine MRI scan basis lack information correlate MRI finding neurodevelopmental outcomes . We unique opportunity help provide information .</detailed_description>
