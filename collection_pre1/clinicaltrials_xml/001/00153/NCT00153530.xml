	<brief_summary>The aim study deliver primary systemic high-dose methotrexate ( MTX ) treatment PCNSL patient define role whole brain irradiation ( WBI ) primary therapy , i.e. , analyze whether patient undergone primary chemotherapy postpone irradiation possible late sequela recurrence without incur loss progression-free overall survival . This study first time worldwide systematic , control randomized manner . In study , one arm six cycle high-dose MTX subsequent irradiation ( A1 ) , come close `` standard arm primary therapy '' , least accord majority assessment , compare irradiation recurrence regard time progression overall survival ( A2 ) . In primary therapy failure , also analyze extent salvage therapy AraC equivalent irradiation `` standard arm '' regard time progression overall survival ( arm B1 B2 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Six 14-day cycle high-dose MTX give begin study . Randomization perform centrally study headquarters UKBF Berlin already study inclusion . Patients meet inclusion criterion receive first systemic treatment 4 g/m2 MTX i.v . 4 hour within 14 day . Dexamethasone dose 3 x 8 mg/day orally 10 day additionally give first cycle . This dexamethasone dose start 3 day first MTX application . Ten 14 day 3rd 6th MTX dose , response MTX therapy evaluate MRI repeat CSF examination case renew CSF involvement . Assessment also make time point clinical deterioration . In case , neuroradiological reference center ( Department Neuroradiology , University Tübingen ) decide response MTX therapy . MRI CT scan sent neuroradiological reference center HD MTX terminate central response evaluation . If complete remission achieve complete high-dose MTX therapy , patient treat WBI ( 45 Gy 1.5 Gy fraction ) start minimum 4 maximum 7 week end chemotherapy ( arm A1 ) WBI first recurrence ( arm A2 ) . If primary therapy successful ( partial remission , stable disease 6th cycle , progression time MTX therapy ) , patient receive WBI ( 45 Gy 1.5 Gy fraction ; arm B1 ) high-dose AraC chemotherapy 3 g/m2 i.v . 3 hour every 12 hour 2 day ( arm B2 ) accord randomization . If high-dose MTX therapy lead termination application 6 cycle MTX ( see termination criterion ) allow AraC therapy WBI , treatment give non-CR arm accord randomization . High-dose AraC therapy administer four 3-week cycle . If complete remission occur already one two cycle , one additional cycle apply . Patients cross B arm . If recurrence progression finish complete treatment arm , patient treat chemotherapy accord PCV protocol WBI B2 arm . This decision leave individual study center . The G-PCNSL-SG-1 study prospective , control phase IV study central randomization . Patients arm submit stratified randomization accord age ( &lt; 60 ; &gt; 60 ) center minimize effect important therapy-related prognostic factor . The study blind . Randomization perform centrally study inclusion Institute Medical Informatics , Biometry Epidemiology , University Hospital Benjamin Franklin Free University Berlin . The plan study duration 7 year - 4 year recruitment phase subsequent 3-year follow-up period 6-month evaluation phase . For individual patient , treatment time arm A1 12 week 6 cycle MTX therapy , follow 4-7-week resting period 6 week completion WBI ( arm A1 ) . In arm A2 , patient irradiate ( total 6 week ) case recurrence . Up point , patient follow fixed interval like patient A1 WBI . In arm B , MTX therapy immediately follow 6 week WBI ( arm B1 ) maximal 3 month AraC therapy . After complete protocol plan therapy , patient followed-up least three year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically/immunocytologically confirm primary nonHodgkin 's lymphoma CNS . A central reference pathological report make inclusion study ( Prof. Dr. Pietsch , Reference Center Brain Tumors German Society Neuropathology Neuroanatomy , Institute Neuropathology Bonn University Hospital ) . Histological diagnosis usually perform preferential stereotactic biopsy suspicious lesion brain spinal cord . The diagnosis cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) require detection malignant lymphocyte accord cytological immunocytological criterion . There 2 week establish diagnosis inclusion study . The availability reference pathological report absolutely necessary inclusion study begin therapy .
