	<brief_summary>The goal project pilot-test instrument design ass relationship person use control behavior intimate partner , risk factor perpetrate intimate partner violence , workplace productivity . The goal validate survey instrument apply workplace setting measure productivity loss associate control aggressive behavior , serve inform development workplace intervention design prevent intimate partner violence ( IPV ) . This pilot-test include two component survey conduct employee workplace set : question determine one ’ control behavior propensity violence intimate relationship , question design assess level productivity measure day miss work ( absenteeism ) day work diminished functional output ( presenteeism ) . We expect productivity decrease one ’ control behavior propensity perpetrate IPV increase . This study represent one first workplace survey design measure workplace productivity function control violent behavior . Successful result would argue wide-scale test instrument , could ultimately lead development workplace intervention design prevent IPV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intimate Partner Violence Intimate partner violence ( IPV ) , often characterize violence woman , endemic society . Recent data National Violence Against Women Survey ( NVAWS ) suggest every 1000 woman age 18 old United States , 3.2 rape victimization , 44.2 physical assault , 5 stalking annually . The economic burden IPV estimate $ 5.8 billion annually , include direct medical cost lose day work experience victim . A substantial portion toll economy , great 50 % , borne private-sector partner form increase healthcare utilization cover employee health benefit , high employee turnover , decreased productivity , increase security measure . As business become increasingly aware burden , institute policy procedure design help victim IPV move ameliorate destructive effect violence bottom line . Recent effort National Center Injury Prevention Control=s Division Violence Prevention focus prevention effort target towards potential IPV perpetrator rather victim . The rationale new direction research idea primary prevention target potential batterers may ultimately affect health woman effectively target secondary/tertiary prevention effort towards IPV victim . The idea stop potential batterers ever abuse intimate partner first place , rather empower victim abuse prevent violence continue . However , paucity data risk protective factor IPV perpetration economic impact IPV perpetrators health care business sector would warrant investment scarce public health resource . Until information know , develop evaluate primary prevention program target potential abuser quite challenge , ability engage private-sector partner direct health promotion resource towards activity . Workplace Productivity Employers increasingly interested identify measure relationship health issue employee work productivity . Information relationship help guide employer type prevention intervention effective cost-effective . Performance measure assess productivity must reflect specific aspect work output , specific point time , specific person . However , modern job ( e.g. , factory line worker ) require worker perform repetitive task easily count track . Even industry employee performance track objectively , company often lack reliable system capture review data . Proxies promotion pay raise also lack detail necessary connect health outcome behavior worker ’ ability perform . Without defined business criterion establish metric monitor daily output individual performance , obvious alternative ask employee self-rate performance . Several self-assessment instrument currently use research set estimate work performance detect effect health performance productivity ( 1 ) . Depending upon health issue ( ) investigation , different instrument may less helpful . In case , e.g. , measure impact arthritis productivity , physical aspect work might important dimension productivity measure . In case , question “ often ” work affect may less important “ much ” work affect . In general , important dimension work capture include : physical effort , social interaction , memory concentration . For example , job involve high risk person fatigue distract ( bus driver ) , others . Some job require use replacement worker ( e.g. , police teacher ) person miss work health issue , others . Whatever occupation , certain aspect work performance affect . Self-assessment tool specifically tailored measure work impact control behavior employee ’ productivity – measure day miss work – also call absenteeism , reduce on-the-job productivity – also call presenteeism . Justification current study A major challenge encourage private sector consider fund workplace promotion prevention intervention provide evidence return investment . One way provide evidence , address , disease injury lead reduction individual productivity overall workplace productivity result substantial loss company . To provide evidence IPV prevention , involve measure productivity baseline population compare productivity level person elevate level control behavior , violence , propensity perpetrate IPV . Quantifying relationship first step towards understand potentially devastating effect IPV society general business sector particular . These data could instrumental make business case investment effective cost effective workplace health promotion intervention focus domestic violence perpetrator , addition victim , ultimate goal reduce incidence IPV community . Trying identify people behave control way ( illegal ) towards intimate partner workplace-based anonymous survey implication employer term “ duty warn ” reporting requirement . First , personal identifier collect survey , would possible make report . We name , ID number , information would permit report person police refer treatment . Second , employer never see data . Only researcher able view data , remove employer information loop entirely , much school administrator protect student high school report recent marijuana use YRBS . Third , “ duty warn ” requirement applicable person specific knowledge crime go occur—not generalize sense person may time engage form abusive behavior , even less specifically , person “ propensity abuse ” ( project collect ) . This survey collect explicit information criminal abuse perpetration occur immediate past , present immediate future . Fourth , essential victim safety victim know exactly may sharply increase risk harm due type intervention perpetrator . Perpetrators may assume victim responsible report , blame consequence report , thus may danger third-party report report make . Significant work do discourage third-party IPV reporting healthcare community precisely reason . The HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 objective address proposal include : 15-32 Reduce rate physical assault current former intimate partner 3.6 physical assault per 1,000 person age 12 year old . 15-35 Reduce annual rate rape attempt rape 0.7 rape attempt rape per 1,000 person . 15-36 Reduce sexual assault rape 0.2 sexual assault rape per 1,000 person age 12 year old . 15-37 Reduce physical assault 25.5 physical assault per 1,000 person age 12 year old . As described previously , violence woman result substantial morbidity mortality society , 50 victimization occur annually every 1000 woman age 18 . The economic toll considerable private sector , virtue subsidize healthcare insurance provide employee leave benefit , incurs least half cost associate IPV . Since employer unique position offer health promotion prevention initiative target potential ( confirm ) perpetrator victim domestic violence , critical CDC stimulate initiative provide evidence-based recommendation applicable . Stimulating initiative first require evidence domestic abuse affect employer . While information know victim domestic violence affect workplace , little known IPV perpetrator affect workplace . Targeting research effort towards primary prevention IPV newly develop initiative NCIPC , interest collaborate private sector . This research study provide unique opportunity priority advance overall mission reduce incidence violence woman society . Overview present study The current project involve pilot test employer-based self-assessment tool measure productivity . The goal research project 1 ) identify relationship control behavior/propensity abusiveness work productivity , 2 ) quantify productivity loss person elevate control behavior , 3 ) provide feedback research finding business community .</detailed_description>
