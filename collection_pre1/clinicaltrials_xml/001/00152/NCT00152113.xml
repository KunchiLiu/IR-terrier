	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease life-long blood condition cause damage brain organ body . Children may develop severe , debilitate clinical state , stroke abnormal blood flow brain . Treatment generally include chronic blood transfusion may cause iron overload , potentially lead severe sometimes fatal complication . Hematopoietic stem cell transplant use cell obtain sibling unrelated volunteer donor perfect HLA `` match '' ( tissue type ) recipient show help , possibly cure , sickle cell disease . Unfortunately , 10-20 % sickle cell patient HLA match sibling donor , likelihood locate appropriate HLA match unrelated donor various donor registry limit . Stem cell partially HLA match family member ( also call haploidentical transplant ) option currently explore patient population . This type transplant use find successful patient , mostly cancer blood . However , significant complication haploidentical transplant , primarily infection , failure graft grow ( graft failure ) , disorder call graft-versus-host disease . In addition , patient sickle cell disease undergone procedure . Therefore , risk benefit haploidentical transplant patient sickle cell disorder well establish use HLA identical sibling unrelated donor . The primary objective study assess safety haploidentical stem cell transplantation child adolescent severe sickle cell disease stroke abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound require chronic transfusion therapy . The treatment plan consider safe excessive toxicity . Toxicity protocol define graft failure/graft rejection , severe acute GVHD , regimen relate death within 100 day last cellular product administer . Of note , protocol close accrual September 2007 meet stop rule relate graft integrity ( graft failure graft rejection ) . Participants currently enrol continue follow per protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary objective protocol include follow : - To estimate 1-year overall event free survival transplantation . An event define toxicity ( graft failure , death , grade III/IV acute GHVD ) , sickle-related event ( stroke , acute chest syndrome , pain crisis ) . - To obtain preliminary information regard donor engraftment among different cell subset , include unsorted mononuclear cell , lymphoid fraction first year transplant . - To observe rate acute chronic GVHD first year transplant . - To assess proportion research participant experience poor graft integrity therefore require additional donor stem cell lymphocytes . - To document effect stem cell transplant central nervous system define radiological image neuropsychological testing . - To investigate immune reconstitution transplantation</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hemoglobin SS SBeta Thalassemia Sickle Cell Disease . Partiallymatched family member hemoglobin AA ( normal ) hemoglobin AS ( sickle trait ) phenotype . Stroke ( persistent neurologic deficit last &gt; 24 hour present MRI ) abnormal transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) ultrasonography require chronic transfusion therapy . A TCD deem abnormal velocity great equal 200 cm/sec . Chronic transfusion therapy define `` packed red blood cell transfusion administer approximately every 35 week decrease percentage sickle hemoglobin ( Hemoglobin S ) prevent complication sickle cell disease . This use commonly treat/prevent stroke , acute chest syndrome , and/or pain crisis . Exclusion criterion Karnofsky Lansky score &lt; 60 % Acute hepatitis evidence moderate severe portal fibrosis biopsy . ( Biopsy obtain patient chronic transfusion therapy &gt; 6 month ferritin &gt; 1000 ng/ml ) International normalize ratio ( INR ) less 2 time normal . ALT AST less 3 time upper limit normal . Severe renal impairment ( evidence GFR &lt; 30 % predict normal ) Ejection fraction shorten fraction low limit normal age . Pregnancy Lactating pregnant female exclude Positive HLA crossmatch donor . No sickle cell chronic lung disease &gt; Stage 2</criteria>
