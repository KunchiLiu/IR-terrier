	<brief_summary>In study researcher enrol patient fail current antiretroviral regimen also resistance 3TC FTC . Patients current antiretroviral regimen change base resistance test also randomly assign either include , include 3TC/FTC new regimen . The purpose research investigate whether change therapy result decrease amount virus particle increase CD4 cell count . In addition researcher investigate relationship existence resistance rate decrease viral load , also determine continue 3TC/FTC ( despite resistant medication ) effect rate decrease viral load , effect CD4 count .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Switch Study : The Role Lamivudine/Emtricitabine ( 3TC/FTC ) Antiretroviral Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In randomize , open-label , controlled trial , HIV-infected patient fail 3TC/FTC-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy , ( HAART ) , offer individual treatment selection base best clinical judgment genotypic HIV-RNA resistance analysis . Patients meet entry criterion first randomize either continue discontinue 3TC/FTC remain current therapy . HIV-1 viral load measure 4 time period 14 day determine virologic response change . At day 14 , patient 's regimen optimize new combination base genotype test take study entry . Patients start new salvage regimen , include include 3TC/FTC base initial randomization . Additional HIV-1 viral load measurement obtain determine virologic response new salvage regimen 24 week .</detailed_description>
