	<brief_title>Pneumonia Vaccine Liver Transplant Recipients : Booster Strategy Using Conjugate Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Responses 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine ( PPV23 ) poor organ transplant recipient . We recently show conjugate pneumococcal vaccine ( PCV7 ) immunogenic population response remain suboptimal . This clinical study design assess immunogenicity novel pneumococcal vaccination strategy cohort adult liver transplant recipient . The trial compare group patient prim pneumococcal conjugate vaccine plus polysaccharide boost group prim placebo plus standard 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine . Specific objective study : - To determine quantitative antibody response use vaccine strategy - To determine functional antibody response opsonophagocytic assay . This assay advantage assess patient antibody response represent truly functional antibody display opsonic activity pneumococcus likely well correlate protective efficacy . - To determine durability response two year In addition , safety conjugate vaccine determination whether time transplant affect response vaccination make . HYPOTHESIS : It hypothesize PCV7 prim provide enhance response immunosuppressed individual may respond poorly standard vaccination . RESEARCH PLAN : We enroll 130 liver transplant recipients out-patient transplant clinic Toronto General Hospital , Toronto , Ontario . Recipients pneumococcal vaccination past 5 year exclude . Upon enrolment , patient randomize receive either placebo PCV7 blind fashion . Eight week later , subject receive PPV23 . Serum obtain baseline , 8 week , 16 week , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month . Sera use perform antibody test seven pneumococcal serotypes ( 4 , 6B , 9V , 14 , 18C , 19F , 23F ) . The baseline , 8 , 16 week serum use opsonophagocytic assay seven serotypes . A baseline nasopharyngeal swab also obtain look colonization Streptococcus pneumoniae . Patient recruitment expect take two year follow-up patient complete year 3 . An additional 4 month need complete laboratory test . The primary outcome anticapsular antibody concentration 16 week . A serotype response define 2-fold great rise titer 8 week concentration . A vaccine response define response least one serotype seven measure . FUTURE DIRECTIONS : Results trial help develop rational optimal pneumococcal vaccination strategy would prevent significant morbidity organ transplant recipient . We currently study impact pneumococcal disease transplantation : ( ) review invasive pneumococcal disease transplant recipients Toronto-Peel region determine incidence predominate serotypes ; ( ii ) Canadian survey vaccination practice transplantation ; ( iii ) 3-year follow-up study determine sustainability immune response pneumococcal vaccine renal transplant patient previously enrol vaccine trial . We hope study form basis pneumococcal vaccination recommendation organ transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
