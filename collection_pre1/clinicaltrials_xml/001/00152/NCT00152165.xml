	<brief_summary>Twelve subject seek study . Six subject receive DYNESYS system six subject receive posterior lumbar interbody fusion ( PLIF ) Silhouette device . All subject already participate DYNESYS multi-center study ( IRB # 4884 ) randomize either group . Five tantalum bead insert vertebra associate DYNESYS fusion surgery . Subjects follow conjunction multi-center follow-up schedule RSA exams follow time point surgery : 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month . Standing neutral , flexion , extension , lateral bending film collect time point amount motion direction `` mark '' vertebra measure . The time point select base clinical relevance comparison standard care , fusion procedure . Depending initial tension annular fiber , possible DYNESYS exhibit motion time . The time point important track potential change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Radiostereometric Analysis ( RSA ) Following Spinal Fusion Versus DYNESYS Stabilization System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The amount motion vertebra follow spinal surgery important determine success procedure . Assessment spinal motion , continue , difficult clinical problem . Errors 10 degree simple measurement flexion , extension , side bending record use conventional radiograph . It therefore difficult accurately measure change spinal motion use conventional radiograph . Radiostereometric Analysis , RSA , accurate vivo measurement technique use two simultaneous radiograph examine spinal motion . The measurement accuracy offer technique far exceed manual technique currently use . In addition improve accuracy , provide information spinal motion comparison conventional radiograph . Utilization RSA technology IHP United States infancy . The investigator place much effort past 1-2 year put necessary dedicated resource personnel place . This collaborative effort Department Orthopedic Surgery Imaging Core IHP . Preliminary work accuracy , reliability , surgical planning use RSA complete presented national conference . The purpose study ass amount motion lumbar spine patient dynamic stabilization system , DYNESYS . Currently DYNESYS investigation part multi-center clinical trial ( IRB # 4884 ) . The DYNESYS system design allow motion spine provide necessary stability spinal segment . The amount degree motion currently unknown . By use tantalum bead marker place spine time surgery , RSA analysis determine amount motion DYNESYS system provide . Normal spinal motion lower spine approximately 18 12 degree flexion/extension lateral bending , respectively . Lumbar interbody fusion , current standard surgical procedure , result 5 degree less spinal motion . Since DYNESYS provide dynamic stabilization , estimate 20 % loss motion DYNESYS comparison normal motion . Two question examine study : 1 ) amount flexion/extension lateral bending motion occur spine dynamic stabilization system relation lumbar interbody fusion procedure ? 2 ) amount motion change time frame study ? This study involve 12 patient ( 6 DYNESYS 6 posterior lumbar interbody fusion , PLIF ) SUNY Upstate Medical University . Any subject part DYNESYS multi-center clinical trial ( IRB # 4884 ) approach participate RSA study . The subject already randomly assign fusion group DYNESYS group . The RSA study single center , non-randomized design . All 12 subject 10-15 tantalum marker place spine time DYNESYS fusion surgery . After surgery , subject special x-ray take RSA analysis complete . Subjects see follow time point surgery : 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month .</detailed_description>
