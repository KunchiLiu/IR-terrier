	<brief_summary>Childhood leukemia cure chemotherapy alone may effectively treat allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . Moreover , patient chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) proven curative modality treatment . Patients receive hematopoietic stem cell HLA match sibling donor proven less risk disease relapse regimen related toxicity . However , 70 % patient need HSCT HLA match sibling donor . This necessitate search alternative donor , may increase risk poor outcome . The nature hematopoietic stem cell graft implicate primary factor determine outcome . The standard stem cell graft unmanipulated bone marrow , recently several advantage T-lymphocyte deplete bone marrow mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cell ( PBPC ) demonstrate . However , T-cell depletion may increase risk infectious complication leukemic recurrence unmanipulated stem cell graft may increase risk graft vs. host disease ( GVHD ) . A key element long range strategy improve outcomes patient undergo match unrelated donor ( MUD ) HSCT provide optimal graft . The primary objective clinical trial estimate incidence acute GVHD pediatric patient hematologic malignancy receive HSCT unmanipulated marrow graft . The result study used foundation future trial relate engineering unrelated donor graft .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary outcome evaluation clinical study include follow : - To estimate overall survival patient high risk hematological malignancy receive HSCT unmanipulated marrow graft peripheral blood stem cell graft - To estimate disease-free survival relapse rate - To estimate rate chronic GvHD graft failure - To estimate incidence non-hematologic peri-transplant regimen-related toxicity regimen-related mortality first 100 day transplantation - To estimate time neutrophil platelet engraftment transplantation - To determine degree NK cell T-cell immune reconstitution 30 day 100 day post-transplant - To estimate incidence EBV reactivation post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLPD ) - To determine pharmacokinetics anti-thymocyte globulin ( rATG ) patient receive allogeneic transplantation development rATG antibody Originally study begin randomized comparison unmanipulated bone marrow T-cell deplete bone marrow utilize investigational CliniMACS selection system . The hypothesis test time incidence severe acute GvHD significantly reduce child receive HSCT T-cell deplete bone marrow stem cell graft compare receiving unmanipulated graft . Approximately midway study evidence indicate although incidence severe acute GvHD T-cell depletion low , significantly low standard treatment unmanipulated bone marrow . Therefore study amend remove T-cell depleted arm continue accrual one arm providing patient unmanipulated bone marrow stem cell graft . The primary objective determine true incidence severe acute GvHD 15 % report . The observational group receive PBPC remain open patient whose donor donor center choose provide PBPC lieu bone marrow . Only one patient assign group ; therefore , valid conclusion formulate . Intervention analysis base patient receive unmanipulated stem cell product . For study , investigator request bone marrow study subject . However , final determination source hematopoietic stem cell , bone marrow peripheral blood , discretion donor donor center . Those participant receive peripheral blood stem cell product follow observational group . All participant , whether recipient bone marrow blood stem cell product , receive preparative conditioning regimen</detailed_description>
