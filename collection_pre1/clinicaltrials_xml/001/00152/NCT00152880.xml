	<brief_summary>A large number hepatitis B surface antigen positive individual HBeAg negative normal liver test . Historically , patient think suppressed viral replication consider low risk complication . With use sensitive technology , physician able identify group patient HBeAg negative , normal liver enzyme , detectable HBV DNA . Some patient develop sign liver inflammation fibrosis biopsy . We intend investigate whether normal , programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) play role cause silent liver injury group patient . In word purpose study see whether apoptosis may responsible silent liver death injury occur call inactive carrier HBeAg negative , normal serum ALT value HBV DNA &gt; 10,000 copies/mL . In study liver biopsy would routinely collect clinic investigate evidence inflammation fibrosis , special test would perform detect evidence apoptosis . Around 30 patient UHN would participate study . This study test hypothesis subject HBeAg negative , normal ALT HBV DNA ≥10,000 copies/mL demonstrate increase rate apoptosis liver tissue compare healthy age-matched control . If hypothesis confirm , imply previous assumption group patient inactive disease false would implicate apoptosis important mechanism responsible cause liver damage . If apoptotic activity indeed elevate , study pathway could potentially yield therapeutic intervention inhibit apoptosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Through retrospective chart review , patient HBsAg HBeAg negative , normal ALT , HBV DNA &gt; 10,000 copies/mL undergo liver biopsy identify . These individual patient Toronto Western Hospital Liver Clinics . Inclusion criterion : ( 1 ) HBsAg positive . ( 2 ) Stable HBeAg status least one year prior biopsy . ( 3 ) Normal ALT level ( define &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ) least 90 day prior biopsy . ( 4 ) HBV DNA ≥10,000 copies/mL PCR measure within 90 day liver biopsy.Exclusion criterion : ( 1 ) Coinfection viral hepatitis A , C D. ( 2 ) Coinfection HIV . ( 3 ) Presence Hepatoma . ( 4 ) Known presence malignancy . ( 5 ) Previous antiviral treatment.The diagnosis hepatitis B base standard serological assay result HBV DNA detect polymerase chain reaction use Cobas Amplicor HBV Monitor Test ( Roche Diagnostics inc. ) . This test part usual blood work regularly perform patients.We intend stain liver biopsy quantitative assessment apoptotic activity use three stain technique : ( 1 ) TUNEL . ( 2 ) Immunohistochemistry activate caspase-3 , caspase-9 cytochrome-C release . ( 3 ) Western blot caspase 3,6,7,8 9 . Liver biopsy perform clinically indicate independent study protocol.At time liver biopsy , liver tissue was/will buffer formalin embed paraffin . Tissue also freeze minus 80 degree Western blot . Two age-matched control group patient also randomly select compare study population . These control liver biopsy stain apoptotic activity disease activity well . These control group include patient : ( 1 ) HBeAg negative , unstable ( elevate ) ALT . ( 2 ) Healthy control ( live donor biopsy ) . All section assess apoptotic activity use appropriate technique specific TUNEL , immunohistochemistry Western blot respectively . Liver histology also review grade stage experience hepatopathologist UHN . Necroinflammatory activity assess use Ishak ’ hepatitis activity index Laennec grading system ( minor modification METAVIR system ) use assessment hepatic fibrosis . Liver cell apoptosis assess various technique report study group control group mean +/- SEM . To compare mean group , ANOVA Student ’ test perform . Pearson ’ correlation coefficient use measure degree association apoptosis histopathological activity liver biopsy . Only principal investigator access personal demographic information relate individual include . Those perform pathological review statistical analysis blind patient information .</detailed_description>
