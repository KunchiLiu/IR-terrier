	<brief_title>Physical Therapy Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After patient select consented study , fill series questionnaire . These survey use stratify patient 's disease activity , assess perception disease limitation include quality life , fatigue pain . We intend use Systemic Lupus Disease Activity Index ( SLEDAI ) quantify disease activity SLICC characterize study population . Pain , fatigue depression assess Pain Visual analogue scale , Fatigue Severity Score ( FSS ) , Patient Global Assessment BECK depression scale . Other initial data collect include patient 's prednisone dose rest heart rate . No specific laboratory data collect study . Patients continue standard care monitoring base disease activity medication . The 100 patient randomize approximately 50 exercise group 50 relaxation therapy group . The relaxation group serve control arm study . The patient relaxation therapy group undergo training session biofeedback well receive material relaxation technique relaxation tape . The relaxation tape request subject systematically contract relax eleven isolated muscle group . These muscle group include ; hand wrist , biceps triceps , shoulder alone , neck , tongue mouth , eye , nose forehead , back alone , abdominal area alone , thighs alone , calve foot finally toe alone . This group subject ask perform relaxation exercise home minimum three time week . The subject exercise group visit 2 time per week total 8 week , total 16 visit . The first visit include general evaluation ( strength , range motion , stand balance , gait assessment , baseline vitals ) , determination heart rate range exercise explanation exercise portion study home exercise program . Visits 2 16 participate simple , supervise exercise physical therapy center University Chicago . Heart rate measure several time throughout exercise visit . Additionally , subject ask rate level pain , blood pressure take advise regard home exercise . Each subject see 16 visit total , unless he/she stop attend PT session .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis SLE ACR criterion ; Age 16+ patient active lupus flare , patient physical limitation impair ability participate physical therapy . Other group exclude limit pulmonary disease coronary artery disease . Patients mechanical structural abnormality would prohibit exercise ( i.e . avascular necrosis weightbearing joint ) also exclude . Finally , patient already participate regular exercise program ( &gt; 1 day per week ) , condition ( base physician discretion ) prohibit participate physical therapy qualify study .</criteria>
