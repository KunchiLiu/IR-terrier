	<brief_title>Use Radiostereometric Analysis Beads ( RSA ) Measure Motion Spine , Following Lumbar Spinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assessment segmental spinal motion continue difficult clinical problem . X-ray measurement error 10 degree simple measurement flexion , extension side bending record . It extremely difficult measure small change vertebral alignment may prove clinical significance . The measurement accuracy RSA technique far exceed manual technique date . RSA allow surgeon monitor spatial relationship within spine time much high accuracy conventional technique . This non-randomized prospective study design look use RSA spinal surgery patient . Subjects study undergo indicate surgery . Prior closure , implant tantalum bead , serve landmark RSA film pair take post-operatively . The subject standard post-operative x-rays 6 weeks-3 month post-op 12 month post-op . Yearly visit anticipate 5-10 year proper funding .</detailed_description>
