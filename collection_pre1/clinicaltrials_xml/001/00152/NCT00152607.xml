	<detailed_description>Preoperative Evaluation Recipients : Recipients consent live donor liver transplantation follow measurement perform addition normally perform pretransplant workup . 1 . Ideal , dry current body weight . 2 . An estimation recipient 's actual liver volume determine linear CT scanning . Continuous axial-10 mm-thick slice obtain follow IV contrast . The area liver electronically outline CT console multiply slice thickness . This measurement use assess accuracy CT predict liver weight volume compare actual volume displacement weight follow hepatectomy . 3 . The expected ideal volume recipient liver calculate patient 's body weight . Standard liver volume ( ml ) = 706.2 x ( body surface area [ m2 ] + 2.4 . Body surface area calculate follow formula : BSA = Square root ( Height [ inch ] x Weight [ lbs. ] /3131 ) . Example : A recipient 5 ' 4 '' weigh 121 lb . body surface area 1.58m2 . Thus estimate ideal liver volume recipient 1120 cc . In order provide adequate hepatic parenchyma function would require 35 % -40 % volume = 392 - 447 cc liver tissue . Donor Evaluation : 1 . Actual ideal body weight . 2 . History physical exam . 3 . Psychosocial evaluation donor perform social worker kidney transplant program . Since affiliated liver program , able objectively assess potential donor 's psychosocial condition . He continue see patient ( donor ) operation hospitalize outpatient prn basis . 4 . Evaluations donor advocate physician part transplant department . The potential donor interview alone physician allow express reservation concern procedure private . The donor advocate physician review donor workup detail ensure appropriateness . Should donor advocate physician indicate donor unsuitable , donor exclude evaluation . 5 . Donor must usual state health , normal liver function major pre-existing medical condition . 6 . Laboratory test rule concomitant disease would exclude donation would include follow : Blood type HLA CBC differential , platelet count Chem 17 , SGPT , GGTP , Calcium , Magnesium PT , PTT Pregnancy test premenopausal woman Hepatitis B surface antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C HIV serology CXR , EKG Cardiac stress test pulmonary function test indicate 7 . An estimation recipient 's right left lobe size determine linear CT scanning . Continuous axial-10mm-thick slice obtain follow IV contrast . The area liver electronically outline CT console multiply slice thickness . This measurement use assess accuracy CT predict liver weight volume compare actual volume displacement weight follow hepatectomy donor . 8 . Hepatic arteriogram evaluate arterial anatomy liver . 9 . Liver biopsy . 10 . Informed consent . The donor consent crucial ethical issue . The donor must exceptionally well informed concern risk partial hepatectomy . A difficult element inform consent , however , donor must make voluntary choice without coercion . In order avoid coercion , live donor liver transplant perform emergency situation . By exclude emergent case , time fully consider experimental option live donor transplantation standard option cadaveric donor transplantation afford . The potential donor medically evaluate independent ( non-study relate ) physician prior consideration hepatectomy . Karen Kim , M.D. , Sunanda Kane , M.D. , section gastroenterology , donor physician/advocates . We feel knowledge gastroenterology necessary give nature contemplate surgery , hepatic lobectomy . However , neither affiliation liver transplant team , either clinical research . These physician know potential recipient 's status , final arbiter donor 's suitability , serve donor 's advocate throughout transplantation process . The donor recipient undergo psychosocial evaluation prior procedure . This determine psychological suitability live donor transplantation explore personal family support resource . These interview allow potential donor recipient opportunity express reluctance proceed individual directly involve transplant procedure . Perhaps coercive element potential living donor perception expectation recipient 's family one volunteer donate . This element coercion minimize allow potential donor discus reluctance donate privately , apart family . They reassure time wish donate , recipient tell donor acceptable exact reason make available . Both investigator donor advocate perform process obtain informed consent donor two separate occasion less one week apart . There thorough discussion risk benefit surgery data provide short- long-term follow-up pediatric donor . These discussion transplant hepatologist surgeon . Once discussion take place , donor give informed consent form sign . In seven ten day , donor approach regard liver donation another consent form present donor . After second consent sign , felt donor meet physical emotional requirement liver donation . If , second meeting , donor request time make informed consent , shall grant . Written consent also obtain recipient time . Donor Surgical Technique : 1 . The donor liver partition provide full right lobe . 2 . Intraoperative examination liver parenchyma unsuspected lesion , steatosis perform . Intraoperative cholangiography also perform assess appropriate site parenchymal transection . 3 . Once suitability confirm . The appropriate recipient bring operating room hepatectomy begin . 4 . During hepatectomy right leave hepatic artery leave long possible . The portal vein shall dissect level confluence L &amp; R portal branch . 5 . The use either right left lobe mandate piggyback technique use , vena cava procure . 6 . Arterial anastomosis perform either high-powered loupe operate microscope . Clearly , information actual GWRLW actual GRBWR available retrospectively ( donor hepatectomy ) . The decision use donor organ live donor liver transplant base upon calculate GWRLW GRBWR preoperatively .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 1855 2 . No current prior history heart , lung medical problem . 3 . No history liver disease . 4 . No history malignancy , except limited basal cell carcinoma . 5 . ABO / HLA compatibility recipient . 6 . If female premenopausal , negative pregnancy test . 7 . Related recipient either blood marriage stable , long term , emotional relationship . 8 . The donor 's body size volumetric determination liver mass abdominal CT scan indicate whether donor suitable candidate liver donation donor meet inclusion criterion . Favorable donor individual organ donor graft recipient body dry weight ratio ( GRBWR ) &gt; 0.7 % ratio graft volume recipient 's expect liver volume ( GWRLW ) &gt; 35 % . 9 . Satisfactory psychosocial evaluation . Recipient 1 . Pregnant nursing female . 2 . Patients significant concomitant infection . 3 . Patients require multiple organ transplant . 4 . Significant pulmonary disease . If pulmonary disease clinically suspect , diagnostic study perform exclude presence pulmonary hypertension ( PA systolic pressure &gt; 40 mm Hg ) arterial saturation ( Po2 &lt; 60 mmHg , breathe room air ) . 5 . Patients high average perioperative risk secondary severe decompensated liver disease previous surgery ( i.e. , retransplantation ) infection .</criteria>
