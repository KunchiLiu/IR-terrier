	<brief_title>Strategies Targeting Osteoporosis Prevent Recurrent Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Osteoporosis lead decrease bone mass , skeletal fragility , fracture . Fractures cause disability , deformity , even death . Osteoporosis affect 1.4 million Canadians , 25 % woman 12 % men &gt; 50 year . Current guideline recommend aggressive secondary prevention patient osteoporosis fracture , risk re-fracture high 20 % within year , treatment reduce risk 40-50 % . Because bisphosphonates safe efficacious prevent vertebral nonvertebral fracture , treatment choice . Patients wrist fracture ideally suit strategy case-finding secondary prevention since sentinel event natural history osteoporosis : wrist fracture common easily diagnose , always present medical attention , usually relate low bone mass , wrist fracture tend occur year devastate fracture hip vertebra . However , patient under-diagnosed under-treated . Eight study report one year wrist fracture , few 10-20 % patient &gt; 50years age test treated osteoporosis . A significant care gap evidence-based best practice usual care exists . Objective : To improve quality care patient osteoporosis wrist fracture . Hypothesis : An evidence-based quality improvement intervention overcome multiple barrier best practice improve rate diagnosis effective treatment osteoporosis high-risk patient . The intervention direct patient ( education counsel ) primary care physician ( reminder opinion leader generate endorsed single page guideline ) . Specific Aims : To determine whether propose intervention : Aim # 1- Increase use effective osteoporosis treatment patient fracture wrist . Aim # 2- Increase rate bone mineral density test patient . Aim # 3- Increase osteoporosis-related knowledge patient . Aim # 4- Increase satisfaction medical care patient . Study Design : A prospective randomized control trial comparing propose intervention usual care Emergency Departments Fracture Clinics . Eligible patient &gt; 50 year present wrist fracture take bisphosphonates . Primary outcome proportion patient start bisphosphonate treatment within 6 month fracture . The main secondary outcome start effective osteoporosis treatment ( bisphosphonates , calcitonin , raloxifene , hormone replacement therapy ) bone mineral density test within 6 month . There blinded ascertainment outcome . The intervention expect increase primary outcome ( bisphosphonate treatment ) least 20 % usual care rate 10 % . With alpha=0.05 , beta=0.90 , 20 % loss followup , minimum required sample size 220 patient .</detailed_description>
