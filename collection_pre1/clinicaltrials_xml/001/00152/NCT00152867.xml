	<brief_summary>Background : Dexamethasone steroid , often give vein chemotherapy help control acute nausea vomit . It also give oral tablet patient take two day follow chemotherapy help minimise delay nausea vomit . In chemotherapy regimen cause high rate nausea vomit , use dexamethasone well proven . However , chemotherapy regimen generally cause minimal moderate rate nausea vomit , value oral dexamethasone 48-hour period chemotherapy well proven , although often prescribe . While dexamethasone decrease nausea , cause additional side-effects insomnia , indigestion , anxiety mood change . While patient less vomit nausea expect well quality life ( QOL ) , patient minimal nausea vomiting , QOL might affect side effect dexamethasone treatment nausea . Study Design : The study perform patient receive first line chemotherapy treatment moderate risk nausea/vomiting . Anti-nausea therapy acute nausea/vomiting standardised patient receive non-steroidal medication delay nausea control . Each patient randomly allocate receive either oral dexamethasone identical appear placebo tablet two day chemotherapy first cycle chemotherapy , cross treatment second cycle . Patients complete QOL assessment , dexamethasone symptom nausea vomit questionnaire , well nausea/vomiting diary . This enable researcher determine effect dexamethasone nausea vomit impact side effect dexamethasone , nausea vomiting , QOL . Objectives : The primary objective determine patient preference dexamethasone placebo , compare change QOL chemotherapy patient receive dexamethasone receive placebo . The secondary objective : ( 1 ) compare complete protection delay vomit severity nausea ; ( 2 ) compare difference impact nausea vomit QOL , ( 3 ) compare difference symptoms associate dexamethasone ( insomnia , anxiety , agitation , mood , etc . ) patient receive dexamethasone receive placebo . Significance : This study provide data evaluate whether benefit dexamethasone delay nausea vomit outweigh potential side effect patient receive chemotherapy moderate risk cause nausea vomit . This address problem important majority patient receive anticancer chemotherapy . If overall QOL improve dexamethasone , prescribe frequently , QOL reduce dexamethasone , patient prefer placebo , use anti-nausea medication delay nausea moderately nauseating chemotherapy limit patient poor initial control nausea/vomiting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Study : Impact Quality Life Continuing Dexamethasone Following Emetogenic Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Dexamethasone improve control acute nausea vomit give prior chemotherapy , continue administration dexamethasone improve nausea vomit highly emetogenic chemotherapy . There consensus optimal regimen control delay emesis moderately emetogenic chemotherapy patient receive oral dexamethasone . Many patient complain insomnia , anxiety/agitation indigestion whilst dexamethasone , fatigue depress mood stopping . The impact symptoms patient study systematically . While patient less vomit nausea expect well quality life ( QOL ) , QOL patient minimal nausea vomiting might affect side effect antiemetic treatment . Hypothesis : Dexamethasone give antiemetic delay nausea vomit moderately emetogenic chemotherapy reduces overall quality life . Research Question : Does use dexamethasone prophylactic antiemetic delay nausea vomit follow moderately emetogenic chemotherapy decrease overall quality life , evaluate European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ C-30 ) . Study Design : Using double-blind randomise cross-over design , determine : - ( ) effect oral dexamethasone ( 4mg PO bid chemotherapy ) versus identical appear placebo QOL patient receive moderately emetogenic chemotherapy , - ( ii ) patient preference dexamethasone placebo . We evaluate control nausea vomit impact side effect dexamethasone nausea vomit QOL . Therapy acute emesis standardise ( single dose intravenous granisetron dexamethasone ) patient receive granisetron delay emetic control . Each patient randomly allocate receive either dexamethasone placebo first cycle chemotherapy , cross arm second cycle . Patients complete questionnaire evaluate QOL , symptom associate dexamethasone , nausea vomit baseline one week intravenous chemotherapy ; also record symptom daily diary . The primary outcome measure patient preference overall QOL . The secondary objective : ( 1 ) compare complete protection delay vomit severity nausea receive dexamethasone receive placebo ; ( 2 ) compare difference impact nausea vomit QOL receive dexamethasone receive placebo , ( 3 ) compare difference symptoms associate dexamethasone ( insomnia , anxiety , agitation , mood , etc . ) patient receive dexamethasone receive placebo . Significance : Our study evaluate whether benefit dexamethasone delay emetic control outweigh potential side effect patient receive moderately emetogenic chemotherapy . It address problem important majority patient receive anticancer chemotherapy . If overall QOL improve dexamethasone , prescribe routinely . If QOL reduce dexamethasone , patient prefer placebo , use antiemetic moderately emetogenic chemotherapy limit patient initially poor control emesis .</detailed_description>
