	<brief_title>A Study Paclitaxel/Carboplatin With Without CDP791 Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two part study investigate safety anti-tumour effect standard chemotherapy , plus investigational drug ( CDP791 ) , patient advance non small cell lung cancer . In part one , patient receive carboplatin paclitaxel chemotherapy together one 2 dos CDP791 . The main aim part investigate safety tolerability carboplatin/paclitaxel plus CDP791 . If part one confirm combination drug safe well tolerate , 156 patient enter part 2 . They randomize receive either carboplatin/paclitaxel ( C/P ) alone , C/P plus one 2 dos CDP791 . The main aim part study compare anti-tumor effect CDP791 plus C/T C/T alone . Participants receive six cycle chemotherapy without CDP791 . Those whose disease stabilize , responds , eligible continue receive CDP791 . Participants C/T alone arm whose disease progress eligible receive CDP791 monotherapy . Participants follow longterm , survival measure .</detailed_description>
