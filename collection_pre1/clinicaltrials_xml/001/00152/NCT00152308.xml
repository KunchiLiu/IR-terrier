	<brief_title>Non-Polymer-Based , Rapamycin-Eluting Stents Prevent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In-stent restenosis remain major problem limit efficacy coronary stenting . Either sirolimus paclitaxel drug-eluting stent demonstrate decrease neointima proliferation result remarkable reduction restenosis rate . However , despite outstanding result achieve novel approach restenosis , caveat still remain . Although sirolimus markedly decreased restenosis rate among diabetic patient SIRIUS trial , benefit treatment modest diabetic treat insulin well lesion longer 15 mm locate vessel small 2.5 mm . Additionally , recent study report restenosis rate high-risk lesion coronary bifurcation still remain problem Data patient population enrol randomized trial suggest even caution evaluation impact DES restenosis “ real world ” , operator must deal in-stent restenosis , bifurcation lesion , chronic total occlusion , small vessel , long lesion . The identification traditional risk factor restenosis important predictor in-DES restenosis could explain insufficient inhibition tissue reaction neointimal growth antiproliferative action specific drug dose use . This lead inference individualized approach adopt tailoring choice dose elute drug ( ) accord specific lesion patient characteristic . On hand , although drug-eluting stent currently consider effective way reduce in-stent restenosis , widespread use hamper high cost . Therefore , important develop new method technique would result effective prevention in-stent restenosis available large number patient . These consideration well proven efficacy rapamycin lower rate coronary restenosis , support rationality concept on-site coating stent catheterization laboratory individualized dos rapamycin clinical angiographic profile patient schedule coronary stenting determine</detailed_description>
