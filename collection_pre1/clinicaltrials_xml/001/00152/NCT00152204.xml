	<detailed_description>A controlled trial intermittent preventive malaria treatment infant ( IPTi ) southern Tanzania show treatment dos antimalarial give child time routine vaccination first year life reduce incidence clinical malaria 59 % halved amount severe anaemia . There also useful reduction presentation hospital fever ( 13 % ) admission hospital ( 30 % ) . IPTi safe , interfere serological response EPI vaccine , cost approximately US $ 0.23 per child drug use ( sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ) readily available Tanzania . Hence possible reduce rate clinical malaria severe anaemia deliver available affordable drug exist EPI system southern Tanzania . Under umbrella IPTi Consortium , number similar study plan underway assess safety efficacy IPTi different setting confirm non-interaction various antimalarial use IPTi EPI vaccine . The aim generate robust information inform policy recommendation use IPTi . The challenge transform positive policy recommendation public health action short timeframe . Southern Tanzania unique position able address issue surround development implementation IPTi part district-based strategy control malaria . This project develop , implement evaluate strategy delivery IPTi communities five rural district southern Tanzania . IPTi deliver routine health service half facility project area . Comparison process outcome indicator area without IPTi strategy provide opportunity consolidate safety profile IPTi evaluate impact ( ) rate development antimalarial drug resistance , ( ii ) perception compliance EPI programme ( iii ) infant health survival pattern . The effectiveness evaluation link cost data produce realistic estimate cost effectiveness IPTi strategy .</detailed_description>
