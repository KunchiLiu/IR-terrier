	<detailed_description>Background : Childhood sleep disturbance pervasive , yet remain under-treated one poorly research area pediatric psychopharmacology . Of particular concern grow evidence association sleep disturbance aggression child .

Method : A double-blind placebo control trial 32 subject ( age 9-14 year ) diagnose TS &amp; co-morbid ADHD . Subjects undergo mental health assessment , ECG , laboratory test 2-night polysomnography ( sleep study ) baseline . Subjects randomized treatment ( clonidine ) placebo group 8-week trial . Clonidine titrate subject monitor weekly . A second 2-night sleep study mental health assessment occur trial end . Expected result : We expect improvement initial onset , duration overall sleep quality treatment group ( clonidine ) , result decrease daytime aggression increase daily overall level functioning ; sleep aggression placebo group expect improve .</detailed_description>
