	<brief_title>NPDT Evaluation Children With CFTR ( PSC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol perform Nasal Transepithelial Potential Difference ( NTPD ) test assess function cystic fibrosis gene product , chloride channel refer CFTR , patient diagnose PSC and/or inflammatory bowel disease childhood currently 12 year age great . Dr. Freedman 's laboratory show increased prevalence CFTR abnormalities adult PSC demonstrate genotype phenotype analysis . We hypothesize abnormality CFTR base exhaustive genotype phenotype assessment associate presence PSC child . We would like enroll patient inflammatory bowel disease PSC use `` control group '' . Subjects PSC and/or inflammatory bowel disease diagnose childhood , currently age 12 year , enrol study protocol Children 's Hospital Boston , receive local IRB approval . The role BIDMC perform NTPD test subject . No assessment test perform site . We involve aspect care subject .</detailed_description>
