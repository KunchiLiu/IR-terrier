	<brief_summary>The Trial Reduce IDDM Genetically Risk ( TRIGR ) international effort conduct primary prevention nutrition trial type 1 ( insulin-dependent ) diabetes . The TRIGR study target newborn genetic risk type 1 diabetes mother , father and/or full sibling type 1 diabetes . All family encourage breast feed infant long possible . Prior birth , child randomly assign receive one two infant formula , formula require prior 8 month age . The study determine whether wean possibly protective infant formula decrease child 's chance develop diabetes - animal model diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis study wean extensively hydrolyze infant formula decrease incidence type 1 diabetes subject risk-associated HLA genotype first degree relative type 1 diabetes , relevant animal model disease . Specific Aims : I.a : To determine wean case hydrolysate infant formula reduce frequency diabetes-predictive auto-antibodies subject risk-associated HLA genotype first degree relative type 1 diabetes ( mother , father and/or full sibling ) . I-b : To determine wean casein hydrolysate infant formula reduce frequency clinical diabetes subject risk-associated HLA genotype affect first degree relative . A secondary aim determine relationship cow 's milk antibody , measure cow 's milk exposure , diabetes-associated auto-antibodies . The mother unborn child recruit pregnancy . Randomization one two infant formula take place birth ( 35 week gestation ) immediately birth . Experimental Arm : Use extensively hydrolyse cow 's milk base infant formula need supplementation substitution breast milk 6-8 month birth . Control Arm : Use non-hydrolysed cow 's milk base infant formula need supplementation substitution breast milk 6-8 month birth . All family encourage breast feed infant long possible . The study infant formula use exclusive breast feeding cease 8 month age . Cord blood genotyping obtain birth , fail heel prick 7 day age . Only subject genotypes indicate increase genetic risk type 1 diabetes remain intervention trial . All subject withdraw study . All subject follow 10 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Biological parent and/or full ( half ) sibling newborn infant type 1 diabetes define World Health Organization The infant 's parent legal guardian give sign consent participate An old sibling newborn infant include TRIGR intervention Multiple gestation The parent unwilling unable feed infant cow 's milk base product reason ( e.g. , religious , cultural ) . The newborn infant recognizable severe illness due chromosomal abnormality , congenital malformation , respiratory failure need assist ventilation , enzyme deficiency , etc . The gestational age newborn infant le 35 week . The infant old 7 day randomization . Inability family take part study ( e.g . family access Study Centers , family telephone ) . The infant receive infant formula Nutramigen prior randomization . No HLA sample drawn age 8 day .</criteria>
