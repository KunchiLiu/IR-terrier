	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Photon Radiosurgery System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central nervous system tumor account approximately 20 % childhood neoplasm . The treatment modality use primary management brain tumor surgery , radiation therapy chemotherapy . In recent year , considerable progress make therapeutic approach . In spite advancement local tumor recurrence continue important reason treatment failure child . The local tumor recurrence rate varies accord primary tumor type , treatment technique tumor-stage initial presentation . After conventional treatment , local tumor recurrence rate range 10 % - 40 % tumor like medulloblastoma , craniopharyngioma , ependymoma low-grade glioma . However aggressive tumor like glioblastoma multiforme tumor recurrence rate spite best modern treatment remain 80-100 % . Radiation therapy always play key role management adult pediatric brain tumor . There considerable interest treat brain tumor use stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) use Gamma knife Linear accelerator stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT ) . The goal stereotactic treatment deliver high dose radiation high geometric precision discrete tumor locate brain . This accomplished use rigid immobilization skull frame CT / MRI information treatment planning tumor target . Presently several therapeutic option available child recurrent brain tumor . Reirradiation employ recurrent glioma , medulloblastomas ependymomas stereotactic radiosurgery stereotactic radiation brachytherapy . Following reirradiation , tumor control rate 50-70 % obtain . The radiosurgery dose use child radiation recurrent tumor range 10-24 Gy . The reirradiation generally well tolerated retreatment complication like transient edema , cranial neuropathy radiation necrosis observe 10-15 % child . The result high dose chemotherapy bone marrow / stem cell transplantation child recurrent malignant glioma , medulloblastoma ependymoma disappointing significant morbidity mortality . Intraoperative radiation also utilized treatment primary recurrent brain tumor . In report Japan , 17 patient include two child radiation recurrent malignant brain tumor treat intraoperative radiation dose 20 - 40 Gy . Intraoperative radiation deliver use special applicator electron beam . The radiation deliver tumor resection dose 23 - 40 Gy deliver depths 0.5-1.5 cm . The median survival patient malignant gliomas tumor ( ependymoma , oligodendroglioma ) 12 month 51 month respectively . The two child ependymoma cure currently alive 134 88 month intraoperative radiation . Three patient develop symptomatic brain necrosis , two relief symptom surgery one patient die . Three patient also develop postoperative meningitis . In another report University Nebraska Medical Center , 49 patient glioblastoma multiforme treat interstitial Cobalt 60 high dose-rate irradiation dose 20 Gy tumor 1-cm margin . The patient prior radiation therapy ( Group I ) receive additional 40 Gy external irradiation . Nineteen patient ( Group II ) previously irradiate , receive interstitial irradiation . The Cobalt 60 probe guide tumor use CT scan stereotactic frame . This treatment well tolerate , one patient dural leak another subdural hematoma . There case meningitis radiation necrosis . The median survival Group I Group II patient 7 month 6 month respectively . The photon radiosurgery system ( PRS ) intraoperative irradiation device capable deliver high radiation dos brain tumor . This system recently approve clinical use Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Photon Radiosurgery System ( PRS ) The Photon Radiosurgery System ( PRS ) incorporate miniature , 40 KeV x-ray source capable deliver prescribed radiation dose directly target volume . The PRS consist part electron beam-activated x-ray source seal vacuum tube 10 cm long 3.2 mm outer diameter design insertion body . This vacuum tube incorporate electron beam target inside surface tip . When accelerated electron beam generate sent tube strike target , Bremsstrahlung line x-ray emit tip tube nearly isotropic pattern . Measurements dose-rate water phantom determine x-ray beam emanate essentially , point source , nominal dose rate 150 cGy/min 10 mm , beam current 40 uA voltage 40 kV . The absolute dose estimate + 10 % . The dose distribution water fall approximately function third power distance power source . The generator light weigh , 3.45 lb . The radiation dose adjust accelerating voltage ( range 30 50kV ) , beam current ( range 5 40 uA ) treatment time ( 0-60 minute ) control console weigh 40lbs . The lightweight PRS system readily allow u carry device laboratory operating room . For use PRS adjuvant treatment , treatment applicator make rigid biocompatible plastic ( ULTEM 1000 ) know x-ray transmission characteristic use . The inside hollow allow introduction PRS x-ray probe epicenter applicator dose out surface uniform . The end applicator spherical diameter range 1.5 cm 4 cm . Treatment applicator sterilize prior use . The applicator insert tumor-resected cavity deliver prescribe dose radiation . The operation dose characteristic PRS combine advantage external beam radiosurgery brachytherapy ( implantation radiation seed ) . As brachytherapy , PRS locate precisely within target volume , improve delivery conformal therapy irradiate target volume precisely , little scatter radiation . Due rapid dose fall-off , PRS significantly reduce radiation dose deliver healthy tissue compare external beam radiation radiosurgery . Like radiosurgery , however , PRS high dose rate deliver high radiation dos target volume . Another distinct advantage PRS system ability significantly decrease radiation dose normal structure brain adjacent tumor . All radiation treatment technique presently available deliver 10-50 % prescribe dose normal brain . Intraoperative irradiation use PRS direct application tumor tumor bed limit dose normal tissue . This approach could result significant decrease radiation induce complication vital structure optic pathway , brain stem cerebral blood vessel . Another advantage PRS unlike type therapy , PRS require use radiation-shielded room . To summarize , advantage interstitial/surface application radiation use PRS : 1 . Direct access surgical bed tumor 2 . Accurate delivery high single dose radiation tumor 3 . Superior protection adjacent brain , cranial nerve critical structure use intraoperative shielding intraoperative displacement organs 4 . Superior radiobiological effectiveness ( RBE ) low energy X-rays 5 . Tumor dose inhomogeneity similar brachytherapy Gamma knife radiosurgery , center tumor receive high dose peripheral region adjacent normal structure . Results study carry PRS brain tumor demonstrate capable deliver lethal dose radiation , single application intracranial tumor minimal side effect . It use treat primary metastatic brain tumor . In report Massachusetts General Hospital , 14 adult primary metastatic brain tumor &lt; 3.5 cm great diameter treat single fraction irradiation use PRS . The treated tumor diameter range 10mm - 35 mm ( mean 21mm ) , tumor edge prescribe dose range 10-20 Gy ( average 12.5 Gy ) . The average treatment time 23 minute ( range , 7-45 minute ) . Local control obtain 10 13 patient follow-up 1.5 - 36 month ( mean 12 month ) . All patient tolerate procedure well , patient discharge home day treatment . No new neurological deficit note irradiation . This study aim determine maximum tolerated dose irradiation use PRS recurrent pediatric brain tumor . Dose Selection The radiation dose deliver PRS radiosurgery similar regard dose-rate total dose . The RTOG ( Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ) perform dose escalation study assess maximum tolerate dose radiosurgery adult previously irradiate brain tumor brain metastasis . Based acute late toxicity , maximum tolerate radiosurgery dose 24 Gy , 18 Gy 15 Gy tumor &lt; 20 mm , 21-30 mm 31-40 mm respectively . In study intend perform similar dose escalation study dose range 10-19 Gy , 10-16 Gy 10 - 14 Gy tumor &lt; 20 mm , 21-25 mm 26-40 mm respectively . These dos low establish maximum tolerated dos brain reirradiation adult radiosurgery . These dos also low 20-40 Gy dose utilized intraoperative irradiation adult brain tumor electron Cobalt 60 source . An interim analysis patient enter study perform . Based occurrence treatment -related complication ONE patient require 2 applicator another patient dose prescribe 5 mm depth , protocol modify follow : 1 . No patient PRS treatment use one applicator 2 . The depth prescribe dose exceed 2 mm 3 . Patients receive prior RT receive prior RT would classify Group A Group B respectively . 4 . The dose level two group would show table Section 8.0 . The dose escalation non-brainstem ( 10-19 Gy ) remain , dose escalation longer stratify tumor size . The dose level sit adjacent brainstem and/or cranial nerve ( 10-14 Gy ) also remain . A minimum 3 patient accrue dose level complication observe , accrual next dose level would begin . Dose escalation base incidence acute CNS toxicity define RTOG criterion . Unacceptable toxicity consider irreversible grade 3 ( severe ) , grade 4 ( life threaten ) grade 5 ( fatal ) RTOG CNS toxicity occur within 3 month reirradiation . If patient develop unacceptable CNS toxicity define , dose tumor size escalate . The brain stem important part brain control bodily function like blood pressure , respiration etc . In study , adopt gentler dose escalation scheme tumor around brain stem . The three dos study tumor location are10 Gy , 12 Gy 14 Gy . These dos deliver independent tumor size .</detailed_description>
