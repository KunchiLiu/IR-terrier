	<brief_summary>This study test whether give combination vaccine together docetaxel effective breast cancer docetaxel alone . The Food Drug Administration approve docetaxel treat many cancer , include breast cancer . The vaccine consist three part : 1 ) `` prim vaccine '' call PANVAC ( PAN ( ) VAC ( vaccine ) ) trademark [ TM ] -V , make vaccinia virus ; 2 ) `` boost vaccine '' call PANVAC [ TM ] -F , make fowlpox virus ; 3 ) sargramostim , granulocyte macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) , protein may help boost immune system . Human gene insert vaccinia fowlpox virus cause production carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) mucin 1 ( MUC-1 ) -two protein often produce cancer cell use target immune system attack cancer . Another type deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) insert cause production proteins enhance immune activity . Patients 18 year age old metastatic breast cancer ( disease spread beyond original site ) whose cancer produce CEA mucin 1 ( MUC-1 ) protein may eligible study . Patients must antigen type human leukocyte antigen A2 ( HLA-A2 ) . They may receive adjuvant docetaxel treatment least 3 month enter study , prior hormonal therapy three chemotherapy regimen . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram , computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging scan . Participants randomly assign one two treatment group - docetaxel alone docetaxel plus vaccine - follow : Docetaxel Alone All patient receive docetaxel . The drug infuse vein 30 60 minute week 3 consecutive week 1 week drug . Patients also take dexamethasone 12 hour 1 hour 12 hour docetaxel help prevent fluid retention ( edema ) docetaxel may cause . Docetaxel Plus Vaccine Participants receive prim vaccination follow monthly boosting vaccination , along weekly docetaxel therapy . With every vaccination , patient also receive injection sargramostim increase number immune cell vaccination site . Sargramostim injection give day vaccination daily next 3 day . All vaccine sargramostim dose give injection skin , usually thigh . Patients observe clinic 1 hour injection . Patients blood test every four week monitor drug side effect every vaccination check blood count . A bone scan CT scan ( ) do every 2 3 month check response treatment . Patients may continue receive treatment long disease worsen tolerate treatment without significant side effect . Patients assign receive docetaxel alone whose disease progress 3 month drug may choose receive vaccine come study receive treatment option . Patients monitor yearly telephone call 15 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Alone Combination With Vaccine Treat Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Weekly docetaxel therapy currently use standard treatment patient metastatic breast cancer . Although many patient initially respond form therapy , majority eventually develop disease progression die disease . We explore use combine pox vector vaccine docetaxel . In recent clinical trial , men prostate cancer give vaccine docetaxel without significant toxicity docetaxel diminish immune response vaccine . Objectives : To evaluate progression free survival compare PANVAC + docetaxel vs. docetaxel alone patient metastatic breast cancer . To evaluate overall survival compare PANVAC + docetaxel vs. docetaxel alone patient metastatic breast cancer . To evaluate arm cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8+ ) T cell response direct carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) mucin ( MUC-1 ) human leukocyte antigen 2 ( HLA-A2 ) , A3 , A24 positive patient interferon-gamma enzyme link immunosorbent spot ( ELISPOT ) assay . Eligibility : Metastatic breast cancer ( either male female ) evidence metastatic disease ( must radiographic evidence disease ) life expectancy least 4 month . Patients may receive unlimited prior hormonal therapy chemotherapy , prior docetaxel metastatic disease . Hematological eligibility parameter within 16 day start therapy : Granulocyte count great equal 1,500/mm^3 , Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm^3 , hemoglobin ( Hgb ) great equal 8 Gm/dL . Design : A randomized Phase II study evaluate role combine docetaxel PANVAC [ TM ] -V ( recombinant vaccinia contain gene encode CEA , MUC-1 , lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 ( LFA-3 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) B7.1 ) PANVAC [ TM ] -F ( recombinant fowlpox contain gene encode CEA , MUC-1 , LFA-3 , ICAM-1 B7.1 ) vs. docetaxel alone determine addition vaccine prolong time disease progression well overall survival patient metastatic breast cancer . Patients randomize docetaxel alone may receive sequential therapy PANVAC [ TM ] -V PANVAC [ TM ] -F time disease progression . In patient randomized concurrent therapy , PANVAC [ TM ] -V administer patient 3 week prior start chemotherapy initial vaccine . The immune response CEA MUC-1 boost administration PANVAC [ TM ] -F. Sargramostim granulocyte macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) administer vaccine inoculation four consecutive day patient treated National cancer Institute ( NCI ) .</detailed_description>

Patients may receive unlimited prior hormonal therapy chemotherapy . Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma breast cancer confirm Pathology Clinical Center National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , ( National Naval Medical Center ( NNMC ) ) MD Anderson Pathology Department prior start study . Note : However , pathologic specimen available , patient may enroll clinical course consistent breast cancer pathological documentation disease . 18 year age great . May receive docetaxel adjuvant set least 12 month prior study entry . Able understand give inform consent . Able avoid close household contact ( close household contact share housing close physical contact ) least two week recombinant vaccinia vaccination person active history eczema eczematoid skin disorder ; acute , chronic exfoliative skin condition ( e.g. , atopic dermatitis , burn , impetigo , varicella zoster , severe acne , open rash wound ) condition resolve ; pregnant nursing woman ; child 3 year age ; immunodeficient immunosuppressed person ( disease therapy ) , include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . We vaccinate 700 cancer patient report case either self inoculation person person transmission virus . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Serum creatinine less 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR creatinine clearance 24 hour urine collection great equal 60 mL/min , standard liver function test ( LFT ) limitations patient receive docetaxel therapy include bilirubin within ULN serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) /serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less 1.5 time ULN . If transaminase great 1.5 time ULN 2 time ULN ( currently indicate ) , alk phos less 2.5 time ULN . ( Patients renal abnormality evaluate creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) interstitial abnormality . A Cr Cl great equal 60ml/min measure calculate proteinuria less 1000mg per 24 hour eligible unless explain nonrenal cause . ) Recovered completely grade 3 4 reversible hematologic non hematologic toxicity associate recent therapy . Typically 34 week patient recently receive cytotoxic therapy . Patients previously treat mitomycin c carboplatin require minimum 6 week .

Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) great equal 8 Gm/dL Must agree use effective birth control abstinence period 4 month last vaccination therapy . Patients whose tumor estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive fail primary hormone therapy unless clinically indicate , i.e . patient visceral disease symptomatic bone disease front chemotherapy warrant . Patients progress recurred follow Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) therapy patient fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) positive immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) 3+ positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( Her2 neu ) . Those patient progress trastuzumab may continue receive drug refer physician . However , trastuzumab discontinue time enrol study , resume patient remain study . Patients randomize docetaxel alone ( arm B ) may time progression go receive vaccine alone ECOG performance status remain 01 , uncontrolled pain organ dysfunction would require another intervention radiation chemotherapy . Furthermore , patient initially randomize arm B would like cross continue vaccine therapy must meet onstudy eligibility exclusion criterion exception liver transaminase requirement . Patients liver transaminase level within Grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.0 ( 3 x ULN ) allow crossover vaccine .
