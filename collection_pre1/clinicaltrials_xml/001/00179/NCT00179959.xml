	<brief_title>The Impact Treating Staphylococcus Aureus Infection Colonization Clinical Severity Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) chronic condition pruritus eczematous lesion affect 15-20 % child . It commonly present early life associate atopic disease . Pathogenesis multifactorial genetic , immunologic , environmental component . Generally , decreased production ceramides keratinocytes normal affected skin cause disruption skin barrier function , result increase permeability environmental irritant allergen , transepidermal water loss . There also immunologic derangement body 's response skin injury , manifest increase Th2 response acute lesion . In addition , change incidence disease time climate suggest environmental factor important . Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) infection secondary complication AD , also culprit exacerbation AD . Of child AD , 76-100 % colonize S. aureus , compare 2-25 % healthy control . In addition , S. aureus common cause infected AD . The quality atopic skin may explain high rate colonization infection . 1 ) Patients AD poor expression natural antimicrobial peptide ( βdefensin2 cathelicidin ) inflammation , likely increase risk cutaneous bacterial viral infection . 2 ) The disrupt lipid layer atopic skin result low sphingosine , normally exert potent antimicrobial effect S. aureus . 3 ) S. aureus contain adhesins , readily bind laminin fibronectin expose patient AD skin injury . Consistently , extent S. aureus colonization correlate severity AD show . This may explain 4 ) S. aureus superantigens ( Enterotoxins A &amp; B , TSST-1 ) worsen AD - via recruitment T cell &amp; APCs upregulation cytokine without organism elimination . The Th2 cell pathway preferentially activate , release cytokine ( IL-4 , IL-5 , &amp; IL-13 ) , induce inflammation glucocorticoid insensitivity . First generation cephalosporin mainstay treatment acute impetiginized lesion , emergence community acquire methicillin resistant S. aureus ( CA-MRSA ) present new challenge . Over past decade , CA-MRSA rate high 74 % find region U.S. MRSA detect equal rate AD non-AD patient . Although CA-MRSA great antimicrobial susceptibility hospital acquire MRSA , CA-MRSA often resistant typical first-line oral agent , include cephalosporin . However , despite contrary evidence , patient still clinically improve prescribed first generation cephalosporin . This observation require confirmation . The deleterious effect S. aureus activate AD observation improvement treatment lead researcher consider eradication ( suppressed growth ) organism important component treatment AD . The anterior naris major location S. aureus colonization . Mupirocin ointment represent mainstay therapy eradicate S. aureus nasal carriage , low resistance rate CA-MRSA . Recently , sodium hypochlorite ( bleach ) become popular many US pediatric dermatologist . Bleach long use safely efficaciously dental antiseptic . This agent also show concentration low 0.005 % effective S. aureus wound ulcer . We observe use sodium hypochlorite improve clinical appearance AD , study do confirm . Several study attempt show eradication S. aureus improve severity AD . Most study use topical mupirocin affect skin lesion two week show S. aureus decolonization achieve , patient show clinical improvement . However , skin recolonized S. aureus subsequent month , result worsen disease make long term treatment difficult . Many study treat nasal carriage skin colonization . Although intranasal mupirocin ointment may sufficient eliminate S. aureus healthy host , organism 's affinity specific feature atopic skin argues concomitant use direct topical antiseptic , dilute bleach , particular patient population . In addition , study neglect possibility family member likely colonize well , contribute recolonization . Recolonization also affect failure continue aggressively treat atopic skin appropriate topical therapy follow eradication . Recently , small study perform adult AD , use mupirocin , chlorhexidine wash , cephalexin , potassium permanganate show significant clinical improvement subject . Finally , interest determine exacerbation atopic dermatitis CA-MRSA infection great methicillin-sensitive S. aureus ( MSSA ) infection . At least one virulence factor , Panton-Valentine leukocidin , find CA-MRSA find MSSA . Understanding relevance emergence CA-MRSA AD pivotal appropriately treat secondary infection patient AD . Successful eradication S. aureus colonization patient moderate severe AD may decrease future number secondary infection improve overall severity disease . Aims study - # 1 : Assess impact CA-MRSA secondary S. aureus infection child atopic dermatitis . # 2 : To study whether eradication S. aureus nasal mupirocin ointment sodium hypochlorite bath conjunction appropriate skin care regimen emollients topical steroid calcineurin inhibitor result long-term S. aureus eradication clinical improvement . # 3 : To study impact CA-MRSA overall severity AD . We determine predictive value CA-MRSA versus MSSA overall severity AD base EASI score . Study population Patients age 6 month 17 year moderate severe AD investigator global assessment ( IGA ) clinical sign bacterial skin infection ( weep , crust , pustular lesion ) eligible . Exclusion criterion include current recent use ( within past eight week ) topical oral antibiotic allergy cephalosporin mupirocin . Up 40 patient recruit enrolled . Study Design This study randomize investigator-blind placebo-controlled study . Prior intervention , qualitative bacterial culture sensitivity naris severely infected lesion obtain subject . Severity AD score IGA EASI score system . Patients continue daily emollient application clinician-determined topical anti-inflammatory therapy . All subject receive cephalexin TID two week . Twenty subject household member receive intranasal mupirocin ointment BID five day . The subject receive cephalexin 50mg/kg/day ( maximum 2grams/day ) divide TID two week . These subject continue five day regimen mupirocin monthly three month receive sodium hypochlorite bath twice weekly three month . The twenty subject household member receive placebo intranasal ointment schedule . At four week 12 week initiation therapy , qualitative bacterial culture sensitivity naris severely superinfect area obtain subject . One potential pitfall inability perform quantitative bacterial culture , laboratory send-out cost prohibitive ; possible number staphylococcal organism decrease , undetectable . Blinding Mupirocin , sodium hypochlorite , placebo store identical tube bottle . Patients randomly assign number 1-40 upon initial participation study . Based number , assign treatment A ( treatment ) B ( placebo ) . The investigator blind . Assessment &amp; Bacteriology At visit , % BSA affect AD estimate 4 body region ( head/neck , upper limb , trunk , low limb ) , Physician 's Assessment Individual Signs grade 6 sign AD ( erythema , edema/induration/papulation , excoriation , oozing/weeping/crusting , scale , lichenification ) determine . The result use calculate EASI score , validate composite score range 0 ( clear ) 72 ( validate severe ) . Additional assessment conduct visit IGA patient 's assessment itch use visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Adverse event record visit . Swabs plat blood agar grow 48 hour 37oC . S. aureus identified test coagulase activity . Antimicrobial susceptibility assess use agar disc diffusion method . Sensitivity resistance several antimicrobial determine . Treatment &amp; Safety One-half cup household bleach ( sodium hypochlorite 6 % ) place full bathtub water ( 40 gallon ) , dilute sodium hypochlorite concentration 0.005 % . For child , ¼ cup per half tub add . Patients soak sodium hypochlorite bath twice week 3 month . Mupirocin ointment placebo apply naris subject family detail . Cephalexin proven safe efficacious age . Potential adverse effect include abdominal pain , diarrhea , transient elevation liver enzymes , allergic reaction . Inappropriate use cephalexin lead resistant bacteriologic strain . Mupirocin ointment show safe effective neonate child . Adverse reaction mupirocin include burning , sting , pain itch site application . In less 1 % patient , nausea , contact dermatitis , skin tenderness/swelling report . While long-term regimen may associate development resistance , short course treatment mupirocin associate remarkably little bacterial resistance . Sodium hypochlorite low concentration safe widely use agent . Potential AEs include skin eye irritation . Our previous experience child AD tolerate bathwater dilute sodium hypochlorite without complication . End point Primary outcome measure- change EASI score baseline various timepoints study . Safety end point include incidence AEs report patient parent/guardian , observed investigator .</detailed_description>
