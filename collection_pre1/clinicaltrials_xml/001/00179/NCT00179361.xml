	<brief_summary>Oro-pharyngeal cancer develop squamous dysplastic precursor lesion , occur subset common white ( leukoplakia ) , red ( erythroplasia ) , mixed oro-pharyngeal plaque . Known risk factor oro-pharyngeal cancer include tobacco smoke , alcohol consumption , diet , subset tumor , human papillomavirus ( HPV ) . Along oro-pharyngeal disease continuum , may variations gene expression precursor lesion result exposure smoking , alcohol HPV . However , component gene expression likely associate tumorigenesis tissue poorly understood . This study focus upon early gene expression profile oral cavity oropharynx subject precursor lesion expose common risk factor carcinoma development include smoke HPV infection . This application conduct pilot test establish appropriate procedure international prospective cohort study natural history oro-pharyngeal cancer precursor among men woman high risk oro-pharyngeal cancer Montefiore Medical Center , Bronx-NY . Brush biopsy specimen use collect transepithelial sample cell oro-pharyngeal plaque , well normal tissue define region oral pharyngeal mucosa . Measurement gene expression employ novel high-throughput cDNA microarray analysis PCR-based HPV DNA test . Oro-pharyngeal dysplasia diagnose use cytopathology . Under application , ass plan instrument procedures initial sample 40 subject . This planning period allow precise identification methodology , standardization instrument assay utilized additional participating center subsequent application .</brief_summary>
