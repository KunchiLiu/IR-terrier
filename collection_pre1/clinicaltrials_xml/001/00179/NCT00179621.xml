	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare 2 dos ( 10 mg 5 mg ) lenalidomide placebo subject red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion-dependent low- intermediate-1-risk IPSS MDS associate deletion ( del ) 5q [ 31 ] cytogenetic abnormality . Study participant randomize one two treatment group placebo take study drug 16 week . At timepoint , participant evaluate erythroid response . If participant achieve least minor erythroid response , discontinue Double-Blind phase enter Open-Label phase . All erythroid responder Week 16 continue Double-Blind phase 52 week . For participant still respond end Double-Blind phase , could rollover Open-Label phase additional two year . Participants could remain study total 3 year . All participant discontinue study follow every 4 month overall survival progression acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MDS-004 multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 3-arm study 2 dos lenalidomide versus placebo administer RBC transfusion-dependent adult low- intermediate-1 risk MDS associate del 5q [ 31 ] cytogentetic abnormality . Potential participant del 5q [ 31 ] cytogenetic abnormality plus additional cytogenetic abnormality also eligible enrollment . Transfusion-dependent anemia define documentation participant anemia due MDS consecutive 56 day ( 8 week ) RBC transfusion free least 112 day ( 16 week ) prior Day 1 Pre-Randomization Phase . This study conduct three phase : 1. Pre-Randomization Phase 2. Double-Blind Treatment Phase 3. Open-Label Extension Phase Potentially protocol-eligible participant enter Pre-Randomization Phase evaluate inclusion exclusion criterion Double-Blind Treatment Phase . The Pre-Randomization Phase last 56 day ( 8 week ) . When participant 's baseline RBC transfusion requirement calculate , determine eligibility criterion meet , participant could randomize treatment Double-Blind Treatment Phase time next RBC transfusion . This RBC transfusion occur within 56 day participant 's last previous RBC transfusion . Participants meet eligibility criterion randomize ( 1:1:1 ratio ) receive either lenalidomide 10 mg/day day 1-21 , lenalidomide 5 mg/day day 1-28 , placebo day 1-28 ; 28-day cycle . Randomization perform use validated interactive voice response system . Participants stratify accord karyotype ( IPSS karyotype score : 0 v &gt; 0 ; i.e. , isolate del 5q [ 31 ] v del 5q [ 31 ] plus ≥ 1 additional cytogenetic abnormality ) . A complete blood count ( CBC ) , serum plasma ferritin , EPO level measure determine baseline level . Participants achieve least minor erythroid response ( i.e . 50 % decrease transfusion requirement ) week 16 could continue treatment Double-Blind phase 52 week , unless evidence erythroid relapse , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity . Those achieve least minor erythroid response week 16 discontinue Double-Blind phase lack therapeutic efficacy , unblinded potentially eligible Open-Label treatment . All participant complete double-blind treatment phase ( first 52 week trial ) without disease progression erythroid relapse unblinded entered Open-Label extension phase current lenalidomide dose . Participants placebo lenalidomide 5 mg arm fail achieve least minor erythroid response week 16 erythroid relapse could cross lenalidomide 5 mg 10 mg , respectively , Open-Label Extension phase . Lenalidomide treatment could continue Open-label Extension phase 3 year ( 156 week ) total study participation . Participants disease progression time participant lenalidomide 10 mg group achieve least minor erythroid response week 16 withdrawn study ineligible Open-Label treatment . Serial measurement efficacy safety perform every 28 day . In addition , CBCs monitor weekly first 8 week , every 2 week next 8 week , every 4 week thereafter . Bone marrow aspirate ( BMA ) standard cytogenetic study perform baseline , week 12 , week 24 , every 24 week thereafter clinically indicated assessment disease progression . BMAs submit central pathology review send central cytogenetics laboratory processing review . All participant follow overall survival ( OS ) progression acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Lenalidomide placebo dose reduce dose-limiting toxicity accord follow dose reduction schedule : - Lenalidomide 5 mg ( start dose ) - dose level −1 ( 5 mg every day ) - dose level −2 ( 5 mg twice week ) - dose level −3 ( 5 mg weekly ) - Lenalidomide 10 mg ( start dose ) - dose level −1 ( 5 mg daily ) - dose level −2 ( 5 mg every day ) - dose level −3 ( 5 mg twice week ) Participants could tolerate dose level −3 discontinue treatment . For grade 4 neutropenia , lenalidomide require per protocol interrupt resume decreased dose level absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) recover ≥ 500/μL . For grade 4 thrombocytopenia , lenalidomide interrupt resume decrease dose level platelet count recover : ≥ 25,000/μL &lt; 50,000/μL least 2 occasion ≥ 7 day ; ≥ 50,000 time , respectively . Prophylactic therapeutic use granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) allow .</detailed_description>
