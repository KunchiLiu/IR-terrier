	<brief_summary>This study measure brain activity individual perform language task various state alertness learn central nervous system affect impairment sleepiness . Healthy normal volunteer 20 40 year age may eligible study . Candidates must non-smokers , right-handed , speak English fluently least 12 year education . They screen medical history , physical examination , hear speech evaluation , computer task training , blood urine test late-night functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan ( see description ) . Before screen participate study , candidate wear actigraph ( wristwatch-like device record motion ) 7 day provide measure sleep-wake pattern . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Extended wakefulness : Subjects keep awake long normal everyday life able examine brain condition sleepiness . They engage activity research staff wake time . - Functional magnetic resonance imaging : Subjects undergo five separate fMRI scans-one screen four others main part study . fMRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . The subject lie table move scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . Brain scan take rest subject performs task , include press button upon see certain shape perform various language task , say memorize new word , listen narrative , describe everyday procedure . - Neurological , speech-language , neuropsychological testing : Before fMRI exams period extend wakefulness , subject complete series test measure speech , language , memory visual skill . Portions test may video- autiotaped . - Interviews questionnaire : Participants interview handedness , sleep history , presence medical neurological symptom . - Electrophysiological study : Subjects electroencephalograph ( EEG ) measure electrical activity brain surface electromyography ( EMG ) measure movement muscle involve move speaking . For EEG , electrode ( small metal disk ) attach surface scalp cap place head . For EMG , electrodes attached skin face neck plastic paper tape .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives protocol examine fMRI data take concurrently speech , language , decision making task condition alertness sleep deprivation , compare fMRI-defined neural activation across state behavioral performance , assess change brain function sleep deprivation . An additional objective develop fMRI signal base sleep score system . Subjects 45 normal healthy volunteer , age 20-40 , meet criterion safe participation fMRI environment suitability research normal human sleep . To examine speech language processing also examine depth sleep , use within-subjects free behavior design search pattern arterial spin label ( ASL ) blood oxygen dependent ( BOLD ) signal fMRI data record subject say rehearse word set , describe listen novel procedure , transition wake sleep . To gauge subject ' speech language , record , concurrently fMRI , voice analysis condition alertness sleep deprivation . To examine decision making , compare fMRI signal response execution inhibition across condition alertness sleep deprivation . To gauge subject ' depth sleep fMRI , use physiological ( e.g. , EEG ) behavioral measure ( e.g. , latency quality rehearse verbal response external stimulus present sleep ) . For speech , language processing , depth sleep , key measure include fundamental frequency , speak rate , voice onset , word production , linguistic variable ( phonological , syntactic , pragmatic ) derive record transcript . For decision making , key measure subject ' error latency respond cue make refrain making prescribed action . The fMRI data correspond behavioral data expect show systematic change neural activation pattern parallel behavioral change sleep deprivation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Normal healthy volunteer protocol fluent English speaking least 12 year education . Subjects also righthanded . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : People native speaker English leave hand exclude study . Given nature stimuli presentation ( i.e. , project visual image speaker carry voice ) , anyone noncorrectable vision impairment , hear loss , know risk hearing loss exclude . Normal hearing define hear threshold 25dB HL less octave frequency 250 8000 Hz intact cross acoustic reflex ear . The dual focus research sleep deprivation fMRI yield additional set exclusion criterion fMRI safety normal sleep/wake pattern . Given dimension fMRI exam table , anyone whose body size shape accommodate fMRI project image remain continuously visible exclude . Women pregnant exclude protocol .</criteria>
