	<brief_summary>Retinoblastoma unusual cancer early childhood involve tumor eye , certain circumstance , one eye . This condition result abnormal gene make retina ( back eye ) vulnerable develop multiple tumor . Growths eye impair vision temporarily permanently . These tumor malignant , mean grow within eye , spread outside eye , fatal untreated . Standard therapy bilateral retinoblastoma include removal one eye vision save radiation treatment either eye vision might save . Radiation control tumor growth majority case . Another standard method cryotherapy ( freeze tumor kill ) . Chemotherapy ( medicine use kill tumor cell ) use past tumor outside eye , standard . Hyperthermia , increase temperature tumor kill , widely perform , do retinoblastoma tumor laser ; method standard . The problem removal eye hope vision lose . The problem radiation include incomplete control tumor , injury eye surround tissue decrease growth , ( due abnormal retinoblastoma gene ) child susceptible develop tumor , especially tissue give radiation . The doctor Children 's Memorial Hospital use new form treatment , include laser hyperthermia , chemotherapy cryotherapy decrease retinoblastoma tumor . Some may control indefinitely , reduce number eye need radiation removal . OBJECTIVES 1 . To find well chemotherapy plus cryotherapy laser hyperthermia work retinoblastoma tumor . 2 . To find whether vision save tumor control without radiation removal eye .</brief_summary>
