	<brief_summary>Vascular access consider Achilles heel dialysis patient . It constitute large single cause morbidity chronic hemodialysis population , account 25 % hospitalization estimate cost US least one billion dollar annually . Currently , complication free survival vascular access range 30-50 % year multiple investigative effort area initiate direct prolong functional life vascular access . It well establish whether intervention prior overt malfunction thrombosis vascular access could reduce complication thereby improve functional longevity access . Moreover , access potential risk identify , well establish method intervention , Surgery vs. Angioplasty vs. Expectant Management , superior term clinical financial outcome . The propose study aim determine whether early intervention vascular access determine risk malfunction thrombosis improve long term outcome , specifically , mean intervention prefer .</brief_summary>
