	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Oxaliplatin may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving capecitabine oxaliplatin together radiation therapy surgery may shrink tumor remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give capecitabine oxaliplatin together radiation therapy work treat patient undergo surgery stage I rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine , Oxaliplatin , Radiation Therapy Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery Stage I Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine 3-year disease-free survival rate patient stage I adenocarcinoma rectum treat neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprise capecitabine , oxaliplatin , radiotherapy follow local excision . Secondary - Determine rate resectability negative resection margin patient treat regimen . - Determine procedure-specific morbidity mortality patient treat regimen . - Determine rate pathologic complete response primary tumor patient treat regimen . - Determine impact regimen anorectal function quality life patient . - Determine feasibility use molecular study assess surgical resection margin tumor response patient treat regimen . - Determine molecular marker associate local tumor recurrence patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients undergo high-dose external beam radiotherapy daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 . Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 22-35 oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 , 8 , 22 , 29 . Approximately 4-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient undergo local excision tumor . Patients T3 disease positive resection margin local excision undergo radical resection rectum receive additional chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy discretion physician . Quality life assess baseline 1 year surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , every 4 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 102 patient accrue study within 2.8 year .</detailed_description>
