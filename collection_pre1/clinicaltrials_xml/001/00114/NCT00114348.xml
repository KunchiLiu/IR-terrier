	<detailed_description>The study base result five consecutive trial perform ALL-REZ BFM study group since 1983 . Thus study meet criteria evidence-based therapy , develop nearly 20 year . Multi-agent chemotherapy short intensive course , separate treatment-free interval , prove successful form induction consolidation therapy . It follow preventative ( therapeutic ) cranial irradiation continuation therapy . A number risk factor , particularly time relapse , site relapse , ALL immunophenotype , allow stratification patient group acceptable prognosis treatment chemotherapy alone second group high risk subsequent recurrence follow achievement second remission . The latter group require intensification consolidation therapy allogenic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . To date , indication SCT remain unclear large heterogeneous group patient intermediate prognosis . During precursor study ALL-REZ BFM 96 , however , amount minimal residual disease ( MRD ) determine quantitatively clonal molecular marker second induction therapy element show highly significant predictor relapse-free survival . The primary objective study ALL-REZ BFM 2002 randomize comparison lower dose less intensive , continuous consolidation therapy conventional therapy administer treatment block . Outcome measure reduction MRD , event-free overall survival , toxicity associate treatment strategy . The secondary objective include improvement prognosis intermediate risk group use stratification treatment arm without allogenic SCT base MRD result second treatment element induction therapy . An additional aim improve remission induction rate group increase treatment intensity induction . This achieve shortening interval treatment block keep principle guide therapy define protocol . A series biological companion study aim advance understand disorder establish novel prognostic factor allow risk-adapted therapy .</detailed_description>
