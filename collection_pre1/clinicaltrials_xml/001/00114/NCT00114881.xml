	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine way environmental factor ( like component inner-city household dust ) affect immune system development symptom asthma inner city child . The study divide three period , subject age birth 10 year old . Each age bracket explore different objective endpoint . Study Objectives/Hypotheses : 1 . Subjects age 0 3 year old : - Environmental factor inner city adversely influence development immune system promote cytokine dysregulation , allergy , recurrent wheeze age 3 . - Children viral low respiratory infection develop cytokine dysregulation age 3 increase risk development asthma age 6 . 2 . Subjects age 4 7 year old : - There unique pattern immune development drive specific urban exposure early life , pattern immune development characterize : 1 ) impairment antiviral response 2 ) accentuation Th2-like response ( e.g . cockroach-specific Interleukin-13 ( IL-13 ) ) . The clinical effect change immune development frequent virus-induced wheeze allergic sensitization 3-4 year age , characteristic synergistically increase risk asthma age 7 year . 3 . Subjects age 7 10 year old : - There unique combination environmental exposure ( cockroach allergen , indoor pollutant [ Environmental Tobacco Smoke ( ETS ) Nitrogen Dioxide ( NO2 ) ] , lack microbial exposure ) , family characteristic ( stress , genetic factor relate innate immunity ) synergistically promote asthma onset , persistence , morbidity urban neighborhood . These exposure characteristic influence immune expression lung development critical period growth , result specific asthma phenotype . 4 . Subjects age 10 16 year old : - To determine wheezing , asthma atopy phenotype minority child grow poor urban neighborhood develop birth adolescence .</brief_summary>
