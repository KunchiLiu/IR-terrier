	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare efficacy probiotic VSL # 3 versus placebo , addition standard maintenance drug , maintain remission Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . The secondary objective : - To determine time till flare CD patient VSL # 3 compare placebo . - To assess whether concurrent therapy VSL # 3 lead improvement quality life ( QOL ) . - To assess whether concurrent therapy VSL # 3 reduces severity flare occur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advancing knowledge regard biology Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) identify host 's innate immunity may impact development intestinal inflammation . Pattern recognition receptor Toll-like receptor able detect gram positive gram negative bacteria , yeast flagellin respond activation innate immune system . By identification unmethylated CpG dinucleotide sequence find bacteria , lymphocyte stimulate , proinflammatory cytokine like interleukin ( IL ) -12 interferon induce , mucosal host defence invade pathogen increase . A body evidence clinical experimental observation indicate role endogenous digestive microflora pathogenesis inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . The distal ileum colon area high luminal bacterial concentration represent site inflammation IBD . Probiotics show reduce intestinal inflammation animal study . In human , probiotic may also reduce inflammation particularly Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Probiotics effective treatment acute pouchitis prevention . Their use also appear effect management active intestinal inflammation UC preliminary result suggest role maintenance remission . NOD-2/CARD-15 gene identifies colonic bacteria activate NF-kb pathway order destroy invade bacteria . The identification mutation NOD-2/CARD-15 gene increase person 's susceptibility develop CD suggest defect innate immunity may impact development chronic intestinal inflammation . CD patient also likely increase mucosal permeability , thus allow colonic bacteria cross mucosal layer . A central role colonic bacteria would thus appear possible development maintenance intestinal inflammation thus potential effect benefit probiotic management CD require investigation . It appear treatment high-potency probiotic preparation oral bacteriotherapy may enhance concentration protective bacteria endogenous digestive microflora therefore may provide therapeutic benefit patient CD . This phase IV multicentre , randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial VSL # 3 versus placebo maintenance remission patient CD . The patient randomise treatment group receive one sachet VSL # 3 twice day , group receive placebo drug one sachet twice day . The patient assess baseline every 12 week completion study 52 week . At every visit patient routine blood test CD , physical examination questionnaire apply .</detailed_description>
