	<brief_summary>This study examine safety immune response healthy adult volunteer AMA1-C1 , experimental malaria vaccine develop NIAID . Malaria affect 300 million 500 million people worldwide year , cause 2 million 3 million death . Increasing drug resistance malaria parasite , well widespread resistance mosquito ( insect transmit parasite ) pesticides reduce ability control malaria strategy . A vaccine could reduce illness death malaria would valuable new resource fight disease . Early test AMA1-C1 66 people United States Mali , West Africa , find serious side effect vaccine . This study test shorter schedule vaccination AMA1-C1 use previous study . Healthy volunteer 18 50 year age weigh least 110 pound travel malaria endemic area past 12 month may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , urine pregnancy test woman able bear child . Participants randomly assign receive three injection either experimental malaria vaccine placebo ( solution contain vaccine ) 2-month period . The shot give upper arm muscle , 1 month apart . On day injection , participant give history symptom since last visit , brief physical examination blood test , woman , blood urine pregnancy test . After injection , participant remain clinic 60 minute observation . In addition injection , participant undergo follow procedure : - Record temperature symptom diary card daily first 7 day injection . - Follow-up clinic visit 1 , 3 , 7 14 day shot check side effect . Blood sample draw injection return clinic visit check safety immune response vaccine . - Have apheresis , special procedure separate certain component blood , 7 day injection measure function germ-fighting blood cell . For procedure , blood drawn needle arm vein direct machine separate different type blood cell . The white cell collect plastic ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study randomize , single-blinded ( blinded volunteer ) placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial healthy adult volunteer design evaluate safety reactogenicity new malaria blood stage vaccine candidate , elucidate immunogenicity antigen , AMA1-C1 , formulate Alhydrogel [ R ] . The trial last 42 week . Volunteers recruit screen , determine eligible enrol study , base inclusion exclusion criterion describe Section 4.0 protocol . After provide write informed consent volunteer enrol randomly allocate receive 80 microgram dose AMA1-C1 formulate Alhydrogel [ R ] ( 12 volunteer ) Alhydrogel [ R ] alone ( 6 volunteer ) 0 , 1 2 month . After injection , volunteer observe 60 minute immediate reaction . Volunteers return clinic study day 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 follow injection clinical assessment collection blood sample evaluation immune response . Leukaphereses perform 7 day third vaccination obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cell B T cell study . Safety data cohort include follow day 14 first , second third injection available review Medical Monitor . Immunogenicity vaccine assess standardized assay antibody level AMA1-3D7 AMA1-FVO , vitro growth inhibition assay ( GIA ) . The cellular basis immune response evaluate enumeration relevant B T cell subpopulation , include total antigen-specific naive , memory effector subpopulation specific antigen . The frequency B T cell specific vaccine antigen group receive AMA1-C1/ Alhydrogel [ R ] compare group receive Alhydrogel [ R ] alone . The total antigen-specific cell frequency pre-immune ( day 0 ) sample serve additional negative control immunization . The goal study augment previously collect safety data 80 microgram antigen dose large cohort , study safety immunogenicity accelerate vaccination schedule .</detailed_description>
