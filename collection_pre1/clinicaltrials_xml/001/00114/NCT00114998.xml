	<brief_title>CV Disease Adolescents With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus increase dramatically adolescent . This appear direct result increase prevalence severity obesity pediatric population . In adult type 2 diabetes , well know risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) quite high . This lead current clinical recommendation adult diabetes consider equivalent risk adult already exist coronary artery disease . It known adolescent type 2 diabetes equivalent high level risk CVD adult population . If would expect would develop clinical CVD late 20 's 30 's . This would important clinical implication would suggest need aggressive management CVD risk factor diabetes . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study cross-sectional evaluation cardiac vascular structure function population adolescent type 2 diabetes compare group similar age , sex , race BMI obesity alone non obese group similar age , sex race . 300 subject type 2 diabetes , 300 subject obesity 300 non obese subject study . Assessment CVD development accomplish use novel non invasive imaging method subclinical atherosclerosis include echocardiographic measurement cardiac structure function , ultrasound evaluation carotid intimal medial thickness , evaluation endothelial function brachial artery reactivity . The primary hypothesis adolescent type 2 diabetes great abnormality cardiac vascular structure function compare control obesity . Subjects obesity alone great abnormality cardiac vascular structure function compare control obese . Correlates cardiac vascular abnormality include marker inflammation , adiponectin , diet physical activity also evaluate .</detailed_description>
