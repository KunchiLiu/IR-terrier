	<brief_title>Scleroderma : Cyclophosphamide Transplantation ( SCOT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) serious autoimmune disorder person 's immune cell attack organ body . SSc affect skin , joint , lung , heart , intestinal tract , kidney , half patient severe organ involvement die within 5 year . Treatment SSc usually include supportive care immunosuppressive drug ( drug suppress immune system ) . As immune cell believe cause disease , researcher look new therapy either slow stop process , toxic . The main purpose study determine safety effectiveness high-dose immunosuppressive therapy follow reinfusion ( transplantation ) participant 's autologous ( self ) peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSCs ) compare treatment monthly ( 12 month ) intravenous dos cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) therapy treatment severe systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) . These treatment give order determine slow stop SSc become severe , reverse effect disease . The researcher evaluate effect two treatment serious organ damage survival related SSc , also look side effect two treatment . This trial also include three optional mechanistic sub-studies open subset participant enrol SCOT trial : 1 . Pharmacokinetics 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide Patients Receiving Cyclophosphamide SCOT trial ( Originally list separately DAIT SCSSc-01-01 , NCT00848614 ) . The purpose study determine plasma concentration exposure time require cyclophosphamide produce optimal immunosuppressive activity minimal toxicity participant severe systemic sclerosis . 2 . Vascular Progenitor Cells Pathogenesis Systemic Sclerosis ( Originally list separately DAIT SCSSc-01-02 , NCT00871221 ) . The purpose study measure characterize circulate endothelial progenitor cell blood 30 participant also determine extent vascular cell apoptosis proliferation cutaneous microvasculature participant receipt two SCOT treatment regimen . 3 . Molecular Analysis T Cell Immune Recovery SCOT Trial ( Originally list separately DAIT SCSSc-01-03 , NCT00872508 ) . The purpose study [ 1 ] describe condition peripheral T cell reactivity repertoire diversity SSc patient evaluate evidence potential defect prior randomization , [ 2 ] gain well understanding impact cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) high-dose immunosuppressive therapy autologous stem cell transplantation thymopoiesis , [ 3 ] describe kinetics breadth T cell immune recovery SSc patient treat intervention .</detailed_description>
