	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention use certain drug supplement keep cancer forming , grow , come back . The use omega-3 fatty acid may prevent breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study well omega-3 fatty acid work prevent breast cancer woman high risk develop breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acids Preventing Breast Cancer Women High Risk Developing Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine effect omega-3 fatty acid mammographic breast density ( MBD ) woman high risk develop breast cancer . Secondary - Determine , preliminarily , effect supplement cell atypia breast cell proliferation measure ductal lavage specimens patient . - Determine effect supplement circulate hormone growth factor blood level patient . - Determine effect supplement expression estrogen-related protein find ductal lavage specimens patient . - Determine effect supplement plasma lipid peroxidation level patient . - Correlate modifying effect lipid peroxidation-related gene MBD patient treat supplement . OUTLINE : This randomize , pilot study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral placebo three time daily 12 month . - Arm II : Patients receive oral omega-3 fatty acid three time daily 12 month . In arm , treatment continue absence development ductal carcinoma situ invasive carcinoma breast unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient ( 40 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
