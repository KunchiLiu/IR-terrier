	<brief_summary>Recurrent fall/winter major depression ( know Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD ) ) prevalent disruptive disorder whose pathophysiological basis unknown , several hypothesis attribute causal role circadian timing system . Bright white light exposure via retina show reverse symptom SAD . Recent physiological study demonstrate existence retinal ganglion cell capable transduce light input retinohypothalamic tract , primary circadian afferent human . This retinohypothalamic system appear maximally sensitive light 446-477nm ( violet/blue ) range . Using light-emitting diode ( LED ) technology , light narrow bandwidth deliver safe , relatively inexpensive device . We propose contrast SAD patient efficacy tolerability 468 nm LED light portable 11cm x 6cm commercially-available device ( GoLITEÔ ) broad 400-700 nm wavelength LED-generated light house identical device . The broad wavelength ( white ) light LED device similar cool-white fluorescent 10,000 lux device currently standard treatment SAD ( see e.g. , Lam &amp; Levitt , 1999 ) . Twenty-four depressed SAD outpatient randomize 3-week trial light therapy use either narrow 468 nm LED source broad 400-700 nm LED source , house GoLITEÔ device . Subjects give device write instruction administer daily treatment home , 45min every ( q ) a.m . The device describe subject term wavelength specifically describe `` blue '' `` white . '' Weekly depression rating assessment adverse effect obtain trained rater blind treatment condition . Depressive symptom rat weekly trained clinician . The following hypothesis evaluate : - H1 -- Depressed SAD patient demonstrate great antidepressant therapeutic benefit narrow-wavelength ( blue ) source broad-wavelength ( white ) source . - H2 -- Depressed SAD patient manifest few adverse effect treatment narrow-wavelength ( blue ) source broad-wavelength ( white ) source .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Discovery late 1970s bright light affect neuroendocrine rhythms melatonin secretion , reset circadian pacemaker human , pave way discovery seasonally recurrent fall/winter depression -- christen Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD ) -- treat bright light exposure ( Lewy et al. , 1980 ; Rosenthal et al. , 1985 ) . It reason seasonal rhythm mood human , like seasonal physiological cycle mammal , could regulate biological `` clock . '' A series study demonstrate bright light exposure produce therapeutic effect SAD patient beyond level achieve placebo ( Eastman et al. , 1998 ; Lewy et al. , 1998 ; Terman et al. , 1998 ) retinal exposure require efficacious treatment ( Wehr et al. , 1987 ; Koorengevel , 2001 ) . Attempts construct action spectrum suppression melatonin secretion reset circadian pacemaker suggest 446-477 nm wavelength potent ( Brainard et al. , 2001 ; Lockley et al. , 2003 ) , inconsistent rod cone mediation response ( Brainard , 2004 ) . Discovery melanopsin-containing system retinal ganglion cell serve primary afferent hypothalamic circadian pacemaker ( Provencio et al. , 2000 ; Gooley et al , 2001 ; Hattar et al , 2002 ) suggest possible basis potency violet/blue light neuroendocrine circadian endpoint raise possibility light wavelength also might uniquely potent treatment SAD ( Brainard , 2004 ) . Estimates SAD prevalence range 0.4 - 9.7 % general population United States , depend survey method precise criterion use ( Rosen et al. , 1990 ; Blazer et al. , 1998 ) . In addition recurrent episode frank Major Depression , patient less severe `` sub-syndromal '' winter depression annual exacerbation year-round mood disorder also show benefit light treatment fall/winter month ( Kasper et al. , 1989 ) . Since 1990s , cool-white fluorescent source capable yield 10,000 lux polychromatic white light treatment standard ( Lewy et al. , 1998 ; Terman et al. , 1998 ; Desan et al. , 2001 ; also see e.g. , Lam &amp; Levitt , 1999 ) . Although well-tolerated , transient adverse effect 10,000 lux white light report , agitation feel `` wire , '' insomnia , headache , eye vision problem , nausea , sedation , chest tightness ( Labbate et al. , 1994 ; Kogan et al. , 1998 ; Terman &amp; Terman , 1999 ) . The common complaint -- headache , eye vision problem , insomnia -- remit rapidly discontinuation light exposure ( Oren et al. , 1991 ) , however , narrow bandwidth light potent antidepressant effectiveness might administer low intensity thereby reduce adverse effect increase tolerability treatment ( Brainard , 2004 ) . A between-subjects double-blind comparison 3-weeks treatment use narrow-band LED panel blue ( 468 nm 500 mW/cm2 ) v red ( 700 nm 15 mW/cm2 ) wavelengths 24 SAD patient demonstrate great reduction depressive symptom also remission rate ( 54.5 % vs 30.8 % ) favor blue light source ( Byrne et al. , 2004 ) . Comparisons narrow bandwidth blue LED light white light would even great clinical interest since white fluorescent source currently industry standard . Safety At irradiance level emit commonly utilized light therapy device , dermatologic safety concern minimal . Similarly , thermal damage cornea , lens retina require milliwatt-to-watt exposure , far excess emit therapeutic device . Ocular safety 10,000 lux white fluorescent source assess comprehensive ophthalmologic examination individual healthy eye use white-light therapy daily fall/winter month 5 year reveal adverse effect ( Gallin et al. , 1995 ; Gorman et al. , 1993 ) . Shorter wavelengths light great concern due photo-keratitis cornea cataract lens 180-400nm ultraviolet light , photochemical injury retina 310-550 nm peak near 440 nm ( Sliney , 2004 ) . The blue-light LED source utilized present research ( Go-LITE™ ) determine averaged radiance well 10-mW/cm2*sr safety limit continuous viewing .

Upon outpatient visit study procedure , subject ’ mental status reassess . However , due nature SAD symptom inclusion/exclusion criterion present study , anticipate enrol subject whose ability consent would transitory . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A between-subjects double-blind trial compare daily outpatient treatment use narrow ( 468 nm , 27 nm half-peak bandwidth ) LED light source ( GoLITE™ ) broad 400-700 nm wavelength LED-generated light house identical device 24 seasonally-depressed adult . Dependent variable severity depression extent adverse effect . Research procedures begin Autumn/Winter subject depression rating least 20 SIGH-SAD ( Structured Interview Guide Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorders Version ; Williams et al. , 1988 ) . The SIGH-SAD structured clinical interview rating traditional Hamilton Depression Rating Scale item also `` atypical '' vegetative symptom characteristic SAD . The validity reliability SIGH-SAD well-established , preferred instrument assess symptom severity SAD study ( e.g. , see Lam &amp; Levitt , 1999 ) . A companion instrument , Hypomania Interview Guide Seasonal Affective Disorder ( HIGH-SAD ) also administer . A rater , blind treatment condition subject , administer SIGH-SAD HIGH-SAD prior week 3-wk trial . Subjects begin treatment post-treatment SIGH-SAD depression score ≥ 20 . Dr. Anderson Dr. Glod meet subject provide light device instruction outpatient use detail . The subject ask sign write agreement return light device . Subjects use light device return weekly symptom rating ; see Dr. Anderson Dr. Glod well . At conclusion 3-wk trial , Dr. Anderson Dr. Glod meet subject discus response light treatment indication continue light treatment end winter . Subjects offer opportunity keep device try device end fall/winter season follow monthly choose . Alternative treatment modality also discuss referral follow-up care provide indicate . All form SAD treatment cease June 1 . EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS SAD diagnose basis history definitive diagnosis difficult make adolescent . In addition , symptom profile differs see adult would make assessment use single measure difficult would require substantially large sample size . Therefore preliminary investigation propose recruit individual age 18-64 .
