	<detailed_description>The Surgical Treatments Outcomes Project Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding ( STOP-DUB ) multicenter , randomize clinical trial assess efficacy effectiveness hysterectomy versus endometrial ablation ( EA ) dysfunctional uterine bleeding ( DUB ) woman medical management provide relief . Institutional review board-approved study site include coordinate center , chair 's office , American College Obstetricians Gynecologists , 33 clinical center United States Canada . STOP-DUB enrol ( 1 ) 237 eligible patient medical treatment successful randomize either hysterectomy EA ; ( 2 ) observational cohort 139 patient “ provisionally ineligible ” eligible wish randomize . Enrollment begin November 25 , 1997 end June 30 , 2001 . Randomized woman follow use telephone interview least 2 year observational woman follow maximum 6 month . We also collect information return clinical center visit hospital bill sit directly . The primary outcome address randomized trial impact surgery bleeding , pain , fatigue , major problem ( symptom ) lead woman seek treatment condition , measure 1 year follow surgery . Additional outcome include impact surgery time point 1 year ; change quality life , activity limitation , sexual functioning , urinary incontinence ; surgical complication ; additional surgery ; resource utilization . The cost relative cost-effectiveness two surgery calculate . The main scientific objective observational study examine change time term treatment select , DUB-related symptom , quality life . Enrolled woman sign informed consent participate .</detailed_description>
