	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether patient chronic HBeAg-negative hepatitis B , PEG-IFN-ribavirin combination therapy 1 year lead enhance response ( HBV DNA &lt; 10E4 copies/ml normal ALT 24 week treatment discontinuation ) comparison pegylated interferon ( PEG-IFN ) monotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>48 Weeks Combination Therapy Patients With HBeAg-negative Chronic Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite introduction newer drug treatment chronic hepatitis B , still optimal treatment . Pegylated interferon alfa proven sustain efficacy approximately 30-40 % patient HBeAg-positive HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B . It likely combination therapy pegylated interferon alfa ribavirin chronic hepatitis B effective pegylated interferon alfa monotherapy . In chronic hepatitis C , add ribavirin pegylated interferon therapy double sustain response rate ( 29 % vs. 56 % ) become standard option treatment . To investigate effect treatment pegylated interferon ribavirin amount inflammation fibrosis liver , liver biopsy perform within one year prior screening end follow-up . When patient chronic hepatitis B treat outside study pegylated interferon , visit outpatient clinic approximately every month blood sample . So study amount blood sample take every patient increase compare treatment outside study .</detailed_description>
