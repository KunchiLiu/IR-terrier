	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving topotecan different dose schedule may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well topotecan work treat patient recurrent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity topotecan , term frequency duration tumor response , patient recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . - Determine nature degree toxicity regimen patient . Secondary - Determine duration progression-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine effect prognostic variable ( i.e. , initial performance status , age , mucinous clear cell histology ) patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive topotecan IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 38-110 patient ( 19-55 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 15-30 month .</detailed_description>
