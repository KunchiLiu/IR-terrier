	<brief_summary>This study collect blood plasma white blood cell individual use procedure call apheresis . Apheresis method collect large quantity certain blood component safely collect simple blood draw . The blood component use laboratory research study . Patients 18 year age old currently enrol NIH clinical research protocol may participate study . Relatives patient normal healthy volunteer also enrol . Individuals undergo one follow two apheresis procedure : - Automated pheresis Blood drawn needle place arm vein circulate cell separator machine . The plasma ( liquid part blood ) white cell extract , red cell re-infused donor needle needle arm . An anticoagulant ( medication prevent blood clot ) usually add blood machine prevent clot processing . - Manual pheresis One unit ( 1 pint ) blood drawn needle place arm vein , similar donate pint whole blood . The red blood cell , without plasma , separate rest blood return donor needle . Manual pheresis do person estimate total blood volume red cell count low safely permit removal blood pheresis machine . An adult small size markedly anemic , example , may fall category . Some blood collect apheresis may store future study HIV disease immune function HLA testing , genetic test marker immune system . Some blood may use screen different type viral liver infection , hepatitis A , B , C , D , E , F , G .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order carry research procedure plasma mononuclear component blood , often necessary obtain large quantity plasma mononuclear cell safely obtain simple phlebotomy . These component easily safely obtain use apheresis procedure Clinical Center Apheresis Unit . Other specimen also sometimes need research , blood component , body fluid ( semen urine ) secretion ( nose , mouth , different skin area ) . While protocol specifically design conform requirement Apheresis Unit donor apheresis collection procedure , also permit collection donor specimen . However , protocol , , independent research study rather design facilitate sample collection may aid study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 18 year age old Adequate venous access Blood pressure less equal 180/100 ; pulse rate 50100 , unless low pulse rate consider normal volunteer ( e.g . condition athlete ) Adequate blood count undergoing apheresis ( HIV positive volunteer volunteer vasculitis inflammatory disease : hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dL , HCT great equal 28 % , platelet great equal 50,000 ; HIV negative volunteer : hemoglobin great equal 12.5 g/dL , HCT great equal 38 % , platelet great equal 150,000 ) Willing able provide write informed consent , comply study requirement procedure , comply clinic policy ( include store sample , hepatitis screening , genetic test include HLA test ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant and/or breastfeed undergoing apheresis ; however , sample collection procedure simply phlebotomy fluid collection consider exclusion criterion Currently abuse alcohol drug Any medical condition PI feel apheresis sample collection proceduresmight contraindicate</criteria>
