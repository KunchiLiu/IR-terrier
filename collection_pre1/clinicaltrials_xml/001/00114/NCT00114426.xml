	<brief_summary>In proposal , implement randomize controlled trial determine whether nocturnal NIMV apply 3 month : 1 ) improves ( disease-specific ) health relate quality life ( HRQL ) COPD patient compare control group patient treat sham NIMV therapy ( primary outcome ) ; 2 ) improves exercise tolerance walking capacity COPD patient ; 3 ) improve heart rate variability decrease sympathetic tone COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects NIMV Health Status Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD one fast grow condition world , affect 16 million people US 1 million Canada cost society $ 23 billion per annum ( US ) . Its prevalence rise 41 % since 1982 , age-adjusted death rate increase 17 % 1966 1982 ( contrast decline age-adjusted death rate cause time period ) . By 2020 , COPD become third leading cause death ( currently 4th represent 5 % death worldwide ) 5th lead cause disability ( currently 12th ) worldwide . Ironically , despite rapidly grow public health burden COPD , underfunded disease among major cause mortality North America . Despite progress management COPD past two decade , still paucity efficacious therapy effectively modify natural course disease . There grow interest nocturnal non-invasive mechanical ventilation ( NIMV ) therapy long-term COPD management several reason . It may restore inspiratory rate , diminish 30 % rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep , improve gas exchange , rest chronically tired respiratory muscle COPD . Indeed , several uncontrolled study provide empirical evidence support use nocturnal NIMV COPD . However , paucity well-designed controlled trial evaluate novel therapy particularly COPD patient high-risk morbidity mortality . In proposal , implement randomize controlled trial determine whether nocturnal NIMV apply 3 month : 1 ) improves ( disease-specific ) health relate quality life ( HRQL ) COPD patient compare control group patient treat sham NIMV therapy ( primary outcome ) ; 2 ) improves exercise tolerance walking capacity COPD patient ; 3 ) reduces number clinical relapse COPD patient ; 4 ) improve heart rate variability decrease sympathetic tone COPD ; 5 ) “ cost-effective ” therapy . We carefully select COPD patient ready discharge acute care hospital invite participate trial . Participants undergo “ run-in ” phase 4 week clinical status stabilize . Patients experience clinical exacerbation “ run-in ” phase exclude study . After “ run-in ” phase , patient randomly assign one two group : nocturnal NIMV therapy + standard medical therapy “ sham ” + standard medical therapy . The Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire ( CRQ ) Health Utilities Index Mark 2/3 ( HUI 2 HUI 3 ) use measure HRQL study participant baseline 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 week . We also measure study participant ’ exacerbation rate study period . A six-minute walk test use determine walk capacity study participant . In addition , 2-D echocardiography 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring use determine effect nocturnal NIMV cardiac performance 3 month period . Finally , perform comprehensive economic analysis determine cost well benefit associate nocturnal NIMV therapy . We anticipate study show treated nocturnal NIMV therapy well HRQL 3 month compare sham therapy associate improved walking capacity decrease rate exacerbation . We also anticipate nocturnal NIMV therapy improve heart rate variability lower pulmonary arterial pressure ( daytime ) .</detailed_description>
