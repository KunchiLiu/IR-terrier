	<brief_title>Evaluation Asthma Treatment Strategy Based Exhaled Nitric Oxide Measurements Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over past two decade , prevalence asthma dramatically increase many part world . The current National Asthma Education Prevention Program ( NAEPP ) identifies inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) prefer long-term control therapy form persistent asthma . However , still significant proportion patient persistent asthma receive ICS therapy follow treatment plan . Individualized asthma treatment plan need . The use biomarkers , addition NAEPP guideline , may help enhance level asthma assessment , guide medication regimen , improve overall asthma control . This study determine whether NAEPP-recommended treatment , combine eNO measurement , effective reduce asthma symptom NAEPP-recommended treatment alone . ICAC-01 last 46 week comprise 8 study visit . ICAC-01 also include mechanistic sub-study ( ICAC-02 ) . Its primary objective determine whether `` highly sensitize '' , compare `` weakly sensitize '' asthmatic subject severe asthma , define level randomization completion ICAC-01 . To address primary objective ICAC-02 , study include participant enrol ICAC-01 dust mite- , cockroach- and/or alternaria-specific IgE level within certain parameter .</detailed_description>
