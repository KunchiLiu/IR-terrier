	<brief_title>Ethyl-Eicosapentaenoic Acid Tardive Dyskinesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : One major limitation conventional antipsychotic high propensity cause extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) . Tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) particular cause problem , insofar common , resistant treatment . TD under-recognised clinical setting . However , prevalence study indicate 5 % patient treated conventional antipsychotic develop TD year first eight year average report prevalence rate region 17 23 % . Although majority case disorder mild distressing , TD contribute social vocational impairment , well stigmatization illness . A minority develop severe symptom , extremely distress disable , may even life-threatening . Treatment TD difficult . Dose-reduction discontinuation antipsychotic medication may paradoxically result exacerbation TD symptom , also run risk precipitate psychotic relapse . With exception clozapine possibly botulinum toxin ( tardive dystonia ) , vitamin E7 vitamin B6 , little evidence exists indicate efficacy treatment modality TD . The novel antipsychotic huge impact upon treatment schizophrenia . The major advantage agent predecessor reduce risk induce EPS ( probably TD ) . However , high acquisition cost limited availability worldwide many patient continue expose conventional antipsychotic foreseeable future . Development effective affordable treatment TD would therefore great benefit . Rationale trial : One possible candidate effective affordable treatment TD eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid obtain marine plant source . In addition evidence suggest EPA may improve symptom schizophrenia combine standard antipsychotic treatment , also reason believe EPA may role treatment TD . An open study 20 hospitalised subject chronic schizophrenia report significant inverse correlation dietary EPA severity TD . Treatment subject standard EPA-rich marine oil 6 week result significant improvement TD . We recently complete 12-week randomised , double-blind study ethyl-EPA 3g/day versus placebo add-on standard antipsychotic treatment , forty subject chronic , refractory schizophrenia ( submit publication ) . While difference group change Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale ( ESRS ) parkinsonism , dystonia akathisia score , ethyl-EPA group show significantly great reduction ESRS dyskinesia score 12 week ( p=0.008 ) . This result potentially great importance . Given chronic nature illness sample , dyskinetic symptom likely due TD . This study also report significant advantage ethyl-EPA group term overall symptom reduction ( PANSS total ) ( p=0.03 ) , analysis co-variance indicated association PANSS total score reduction ESRS dyskinesia score reduction . This study also investigate whether EPA may antipsychotic effect associate anti-dyskinetic effect . It suggest intrinsic aspect disease process schizophrenia predispose individual severe form illness antipsychotic-induced TD . These author hypothesise pathologic over-activity mesolimbic mesocortical dopamine neural system may mediate persistence psychotic symptom despite adequate treatment , increase TD vulnerability may cause overactive nigrostriatal dopamine activity process enhance antipsychotic drug exposure . If , possible EPA could , common mechanism , anti-dyskinetic antipsychotic effect . This would explain significant association find reduction dyskinesia score reduction overall symptom preliminary study ( unpublished ) . Objectives : Primary objective : - To compare efficacy ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid ( ethyl-EPA ) versus placebo supplementary medication reduce symptom tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) . Secondary objective : - To compare efficacy ethyl-EPA versus placebo supplementary medication reduce symptom psychosis subject . - To assess whether association antidyskinetic antipsychotic action ethyl-EPA . - To investigate safety tolerability ethyl-EPA . Trial design : This double-blind , randomise , parallel-group comparison ethyl-EPA placebo treatment establish TD patient schizophrenia schizo-affective disorder . There pre-trial screen , follow subject enter randomise treatment phase 12 week . Responders offer option open add-on treatment ethyl-EPA 40 week . Patient selection : Source patient : In- out-patients state hospital community psychiatric service great Cape Town area . Number patient : Recruitment stop 84 eligible patient randomise trial treatment . A recruitment period 12 18 month anticipate . Pre-trial screening : Written , inform consent obtain prior screen procedure . All patient screen assess eligibility trial . The screening visit include follow : - Informed consent - Psychiatric history - Medical history - Physical examination - Diagnosis - Demography - Vital sign - Laboratory test Trial treatment : Subjects randomly assign receive either encapsulate ethyl-EPA supplement 2 g/day ( 2X500 mg capsule twice daily ) ( Laxdale Ltd. ) , placebo ( medicinal liquid paraffin BP 2 g/day ) , addition medication receiving , duration study . Ethyl EPA highly purify derivative fish-oil . The Food Drug Administration affirm status fish-oil generally recognise safe EPA dose 3 g/day . Trial supply pack independent contract clinical trial supply company ( DHP ) , prepare placebo active pack entire trial assign randomisation number pack . The randomisation code broken completion trial . Concomitant treatment : Only subject stable medication precede 6 week consider . Psychotropic medication fix duration trial . Anticholinergic medication : Anticholinergic medication may prescribe follow randomisation , treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) . Other psychotropic medication : Patients stabilise psychotropic medication ( anxiolytic , hypnotic , antidepressant , mood stabilise ) entry trial may continue medication . Anxiolytic hypnotic medication may prescribe treatment-emergent condition , eg . insomnia acute anxiety . Other concomitant medication : Any medication physical condition take prior commencement trial may continue . Medication condition arise course trial permit , investigator ’ discretion . Other omega-3 fatty acid preparation permit . Trial method Assessments : Primary outcome measure : - Change Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale ( ESRS ) dyskinesia score baseline week 12 . Secondary outcome measure effect TD : - Change ESRS parkinsonism , dystonia , akathisia , total score baseline week 12 - The proportion subject group achieve 30 % reduction ESRS total score week 12 . - Time remission ( defined 30 % reduction ESRS total score ) . - The proportion patient achieve CGI Severity TD score &lt; 3 12 week . Secondary outcome measure effect psychosis : - Change Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) total , positive , negative general psychopathology score baseline week 12 Assessment relationship change TD score change symptom psychosis : - Correlations measure TD psychosis symptom seek . Secondary outcome measure safety tolerability : 1 . The incidence treatment-emergent EPS assess visit proportion subject require anticholinergic medication . 2 . Other tolerability safety measure include report adverse event , vital sign weight . 3 . All concurrent medication record . 4 . A physical examination carry visit 1 . 5 . Laboratory test : In addition liver function , haematology prolactin , follow test do : bleeding time , fast blood sugar fast lipogram . Although EPA classify FDA Generally Recognised Safe dose 3g/day , report adverse effect bleed time , glycaemic control low-density lipoprotein cholesterol . Venepuncture perform pre-trial screen ( visit 1 ) , visit 4 ( week 4 ) endpoint ( visit 6 ) . The following test perform : - alkaline phosphatase , alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase - haemoglobin , platelet count , total white cell count , differential white cell count - prolactin - bleeding time - lipogram ( fast ) - blood-sugar ( fast ) Adverse event patient withdrawal : Any new medical condition , deterioration pre-existing medical condition occur wash-out randomise phase record case record form ( CRF ’ ) . Withdrawal trial : This may occur follow reason : - Protocol violation - Withdrawal consent - Deterioration patient ’ condition , lack efficacy - The occurrence adverse event - Patient lose follow-up Data management : All data record case record form . Two trained person independently perform double data entry database . Verifications conduct two data entry process comparison double data entry . Statistical plan : Statistical analysis perform biostatistician . The primary intent study evaluate ability ethyl-EPA versus placebo reduce TD symptom 12 week treatment . The principal null hypothesis therefore ethyl-EPA differ placebo primary efficacy measure . Sample size estimation : We obtain estimate variability change ESRS dyskinesia score 12 week treatment ethyl-EPA placebo add-on previous antipsychotic medication previous trial conduct centre , give 2.13 standard deviation ( unpublished ) . Using estimate significance level 5 % 90 % power , 32 patient per randomise group would sufficient detect 1.75 point difference change ESRS dyskinesia score ( difference obtain preliminary study ) baseline endpoint . Allowing estimate withdrawal rate 30 % , need recruit 42 patient per treatment group study . Statistical Analysis : A single statistical analysis perform end study . All test interpret 5 % significance level ( 2-tailed ) . Data analysis perform Statistica software ( StatSoft , Inc. ) . Analysis efficacy Primary efficacy endpoint : The primary efficacy measure change ESRS dyskinesia score baseline endpoint . This analyse use analysis covariance , include baseline score , treatment receive , centre centre-by-treatment interaction factor . Comparisons perform intention-to-treat , last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) . An additional analysis perform per-protocol population , analysis perform per-protocol population without LOCF ass effect withdrawals trial . Secondary efficacy endpoint : The ESRS score parkinsonism , akathisia dystonia , well PANSS total subscale score analyse way ESRS dyskinesia score . Both p-values 95 % confidence interval present evaluate main comparison interest . Student ’ test Pearson ’ Product Moment Correlation Coefficient use univariate difference correlation respectively numeric variable . To determine contribution individual variable toward TD score , significant univariate result follow regression analysis simultaneous entry , use method least square . The significance contribution predictor variable proportion patient class responder analyse use logistic regression . Time remission calculate . Comparison time remission two group term Kaplan-Meier estimate survival curve . Controlling covariates do Cox proportional hazard regression . All patient receive least one dose trial medication include assessment safety/tolerability . Adverse event : Adverse event frequency summarise body system . All adverse event present table sort body system classification , along degree severity relationship treatment . Adverse event list full Appendix . Laboratory test : Laboratory finding ( haematology biochemistry ) summarize evaluate use laboratory ’ normal range . The data tabulate normal/abnormal category . Shift table construct appropriate , summarize change data course testing . Vital sign physical examination : Systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , double pressure product heart rate summarize descriptively treatment group . Frequency table calculate respective physical examination variable .
