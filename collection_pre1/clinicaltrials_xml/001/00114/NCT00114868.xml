	<detailed_description>I . Background A variety study past 15 year demonstrate clinical vitamin A deficiency associate increased mortality pre-school age child ( 1,2 ) supplementation population endemic sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency significantly reduce total mortality ( 3-8 ) . A recent meta-analysis 8 clinical trial show vitamin A supplementation child 6 month 5 year age reduce mortality average 23 % ( 9 ) . While average impact 23 % , significant variation result study . The impact high 54 % among child underprivileged area Tamil Nadu supplement small weekly dos vitamin A ( 4 ) . While story impact vitamin A supplementation child 6 month old clear , case young infant . Traditionally , think full-time breast feeding practice associate early infancy protect infant become vitamin A deficient . It onset wean misuse bottle-feeding clinical sign xerophthalmia appear ( 1 ) . Recent evidence variety location suggest traditional assumption adequacy breast -feeding assure adequate vitamin A nutriture suspect likely unfounded . It well known infant bear low body store vitamin A depend regular breast feeding source build body store ( 13 , 14 ) . Therefore , mother 's breast milk lower normal concentration vitamin A , infant able meet daily requirement increase body reserve . It become clear many woman develop country poor vitamin A status breast milk concentration may half find among woman adequate vitamin A status ( 15 ) . In addition , show Indonesia supplementation woman post-partum improve vitamin A concentration blood breast milk ( 16 ) . While become clearer young infant develop country endemic vitamin A deficiency significant risk vitamin A deficient spite adequate breast feed behaviour , little data concern impact supplement group vitamin A . Two major study address issue , do group Johns Hopkins University , opposite finding . Humphrey et al . report , randomized clinical trial 2067 infant born hospital Bandung , Indonesia , direct supplementation newborn infant within 24 hour birth 50,000 IU vitamin A safe ( 10 ) associate 64 % reduction infant mortality ( 11 ) . In contrast , West et al . study 11,000 infant six month age large intervention trial southern Nepal ( 17 ) . They find difference mortality supplement vitamin A versus give placebo ( relative risk =1.11 , 95 % CI 0.86 - 1.42 ) . However , significant potentially important difference two study . First , time dose different . The Indonesian study dose infant within 24 hour birth whereas Nepal study dose infant first identify study distribution round every four month . On average , age first dose 2 month high risk period exposure dietary environmental factor . It may time dose critically important development early immune function protective mechanism . Support Indonesian finding come recently discuss study Bangladesh supplementation mother ' post-partum associate reduction infant mortality ( 12 ) . Given apparent controversy scientific literature early infant dose vitamin A fact remain high risk period mortality childhood , data urgently need resolve confusion . If Indonesian finding replicate , policy implication develop country clear . An expansion `` safe delivery '' concept include supplementation infant mother vitamin A would enhance nutrition safe motherhood program impact extremely cost-efficient fashion . As practice India move increasingly direction attend childbirth , opportunity intervene become easy significant potential dramatic impact infant mortality . Goals Specific Aims The overall goal project improve health survival young child India improvement vitamin A status . More specifically project : 1 . Evaluate efficacy vitamin A supplementation newborn infant ( 50,000 IU ) mortality within first 6 month life use community-based distribution outcome assessment strategy . 2 . Evaluate efficacy vitamin A supplementation newborn infant ( 50,000 ) incidence severity morbidity within first 6 month life . Specific morbidity interest include diarrhea acute respiratory infection . 3 . Evaluate efficacy vitamin A supplementation newborn infant ( 50,000 IU ) growth infant first 6 month life . These specific aim accomplish conduct community-based , randomized trial vitamin A supplementation newborn infant within 48 hour birth underprivileged rural community Tamil Nadu . II . Study Protocol Overview : The overall design study randomize , community-based clinical trial . The intervention test impact infant mortality , morbidity growth supplementation 50,000 IU vitamin A newborn within 48 hour delivery . Outcomes interest mortality within first 6 month life , incidence severity diarrhea acute respiratory infection , growth . This study population-based live birth within defined population enrol . Women reside study village identify village-based field staff become pregnant . Informed consent obtain time well baseline data regard family household characteristic . In addition , field worker study ask woman plan deliver child , home , maternity home , hospital . The woman assign study number randomize time enrollment either vitamin A placebo group . Actual supplementation occur time delivery . Study staff attend delivery within 24 hour birth . At time , child dose either vitamin A placebo accord treatment assignment . Birth weight measure , detail delivery collect . Following delivery , short vital status morbidity assessment conduct every two week first 6 month life . If child death report , supervisor dispatch household verify death conduct verbal autopsy . All child receive 200,000 IU oral vitamin A time 6 month visit discharge study ( 200,000 IU dose currently provide government Tamil Nadu child 6 month age old ) . The analysis focus estimation mortality rate vitamin A placebo group . These compare use person-time approach well survival analysis technique . The two group compare baseline characteristic imbalance control use standard adjustment technique include logistic regression proportional hazard model . Results report scientific literature , national international meeting . Study Population : The study population choose project include village two rural block Tamil Nadu . The two block choose inclusion study Kariaypatti Natham . ASSEFA ( Association Sarva Seva Farm ) non-governmental organisation involve community development , education , health program underprivileged rural community . Within ASSEFA area block , health activity consist maternal child health program , run antenatal clinic produce delivers wean food young child pregnant woman . The engine program Health Committee village . In ASSEFA program area , registration pregnant woman ASSEFA staff volunteer virtually complete . Non-ASSEFA village slightly well serve primarily variety government programme . Eligibility : In order maximise generalisability result study , criterion eligibility broad inclusive . All pregnancy occur within geographic boundary participate village , result live bear infant ( ) , eligible recruitment . This include multiple birth , congenital anomaly , bear early low birth weight . Provision inform consent eligibility criterion addition geographic eligibility . Recruitment enrollment : Pregnant woman identify variety source , ASSEFA Health Committee Members , antenatal care clinic run monthly basis ASSEFA government study area , woman 's development worker area . Once pregnant woman identify , cluster worker explain study attempt enroll subject . If agrees , cluster worker proceed assignment study ID number completion baseline data collection form , include determination woman plan deliver child . For woman register , plan deliver outside village , special action take . There three type woman : ) Those go outside village deliver child reachable study team ( 20 kms away village ) . These woman exclude participation trial , baby follow return village , 6-month mortality . ii ) Those go outside village deliver another study village . These woman transfer appropriate Cluster Worker treatment dos give per protocol infant follow location return home village . At time , file transfer back appropriate Cluster Worker home village . iii ) Those go outside village , study village , reachable special effort study supervisory staff . Reachable define within 20 km Block Office . These woman treat infant dose supervisor cluster worker . They follow morbidity , follow mortality base home village family report return village . After return home village , continue follow mortality growth ( morbidity ) . A fourth special situation woman move one study village temporarily deliver outside study area . These woman include enrolled soon arrive study village follow morbidity mortality birth return home . After leave village , mortality follow report family study village . Randomisation : Randomisation conduct individual level , stratify geographic area randomize block size four insure equal number baby treatment group . Each pregnant woman assign unique study number time enrollment . Each set capsule ( two 25,000 IU capsule newborn ) package separately label woman 's name , address , ID number avoid mix-ups time delivery . Treatment assignment code keep locked filing cabinet seal envelope location separate study headquarters . Definition Measurement Outcomes : There one primary two secondary outcome evaluate study . The primary outcome vital status within first 6 month life . Deaths ascertain vital status morbidity assessment conduct every two week home visit . Any child find die within precede two week initiate process death verification cause death determination . Cause death determination identify immediate underlying cause two independent review verbal autopsy information paediatrician . If disagreement regard cause death , third paediatrician review data conduct consensus meeting arrive agree upon cause death . Secondary outcome include incidence severity diarrhea acute respiratory infection first six month life , clinic utilisation illness first six month , growth first six month . Episodes diarrhea , dysentery , acute respiratory illness ( ARI ) , clinic utilisation base maternal interview conduct every two week . Diarrhea define 6 loose , watery stool 24 hour period . Dysentery define diarrhea additional history blood mucus stool . The incidence episodes well duration assess data collection process . Growth assess six-month visit weight , length , mid-upper arm circumference assess use standard protocol . Sample Size Requirements : Previous research impact vitamin A supplementation among young infant Tamil Nadu Indonesia suggest may expect mortality reduction 30 % 50 % . Because even low end range impact would significant importance , sample size calculation do use minimal detectable reduction 30 % . The infant mortality rate ( IMR ) Tamil Nadu whole approximately 60/1000 live birth . The population select inclusion study poorer economically bad health status average Tamil Nadu . It likely , therefore , infant mortality rate area high state whole . We estimate 70/1000 live birth . The study design project call vital status assessment conclude 6 month age . Therefore expected mortality rate first six month low total IMR . Mortality rate decline dramatically age , even first year life . Reasonable estimate 75 % total infant mortality occur first six month life . Applying figure estimate IMR 70/1000 live birth give 6-month infant mortality rate ( IMR-6 ) 52.5/1000 live birth . Assuming type I error 5 % ( 2-sided ) , 80 % power , IMR-6 52.5/1000 placebo group , minimum detectable reduction 30 % vitamin A group , sample size require group approximately 2700 live birth . If assume 10 % loss follow-up brings number require group approximately 3000 , total 6000 live birth . The crude birth rate Tamil Nadu approximately 20/1000 population . In order enroll 6000 live birth one year , must ascertain births total population approximately 300,000 population 150,000 two-year enrollment period . We choose enroll delivery period 24 month .
