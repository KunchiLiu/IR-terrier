	<brief_summary>Boron Neutron Capture Therapy ( BNCT ) experimental radiation therapy technique base principle irradiate boron atom neutron . When neutron relatively low energy , boron atom target cancerous tissue use suitable boron carrier ( amino acid derivative call BPA , boronophenylalanine ) capture neutron . As result neutron capture boron atom split two , produce helium lithium ion . The helium lithium ion , turn , short pathlength tissue ( 5 micrometer ) deposit cell damage effect mainly within tumor provide boron carrier ( BPA ) accumulate tumor . In practice , study participant receive BPA approximately 2-hour intravenous infusion , follow tumor irradiate low energy ( epithermal ) neutron obtain nuclear reactor BNCT facility . BNCT require careful radiation dose planning , neutron irradiation last approximately one hour . In study BNCT repeat , 2 treatment give 3 5 week apart . The study hypothesis head neck cancer recur follow conventional radiotherapy might accumulate boron carrier compound , might respond BNCT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single BNCT-facility , non-randomized , non-comparative , open-label , phase I II trial determine value BNCT treatment inoperable , irradiated , locally advance cancer head neck region . An attempt perform 18F-labeled boronophenylalanine ( 18F-BPA ) SPECT PET image make BNCT . Patients whose tumor uptake &gt; 2.5 time correspond normal head neck tissue enrol , treat single fraction BPA-based BNCT twice , 3 5 week apart . Another 18F-BPA SPECT PET study may perform 1 3 month BNCT determine SPECT/PET response . The neutron irradiation site FiR 1 reactor site , locate Otaniemi , Espoo , Finland , 6 kilometer Helsinki University Central Hospital , Helsinki , patient evaluation post-irradiation care take place . Prior BNCT , BPA infuse fructose complex ( l-BPA-F ) peripheral vein 2 hour . Blood sample take monitoring whole blood boron concentration start BPA infusion , thereafter 20 40 minute interval infusion , follow infusion , deliver neutron irradiation . The blood sample analyze blood boron concentration estimate average blood boron concentration neutron irradiation . All patient evaluate response use CT magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .</detailed_description>
