	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT Background : Venous stasis cause immobility important risk factor venous thromboembolic disease . This especially true orthopedic patient multiple trauma undergo orthopedic procedure . A safe convenient method reduce venous stasis would useful prevent venous thrombosis patient hospital particularly discharge rehabilitation . In prior study , demonstrate electrical stimulation foot safe convenient method counteract venous stasis . In study , compare effect venous blood flow intermittent pneumatic compression , establish method , electrical stimulation foot . Methods : 40 healthy volunteer age 50 - 80 seat 4 hour receive mild electrical stimulation sole foot ( plantar plexus muscle ) intermittent pneumatic compression . Popliteal femoral venous blood flow velocity measure via Doppler ultrasound . Blood flow non-stimulated non-compressed low extremity serve simultaneous control . Subjects complete questionnaire regard acceptance tolerance treatment . INTRODUCTION Venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) important complication medical surgical condition associate prolonged immobilization . This especially true orthopedic patient multiple trauma undergo orthopedic procedure . Immobilization also major contributor increase risk VTE associate prolonged air travel . Despite good evidence prophylaxis effective , widespread utilization prophylaxis VTE follow major surgical procedure well medical condition produce weakness prolong bed rest . There also good evidence risk VTE continue week major orthopedic well type surgery . It recognize VTE occur hospital outside hospital set single entity extend prophylaxis anticoagulant reduce risk . Anticoagulant prophylaxis hospital discharge although indicated certain high risk group inconvenient since recommend method , LMWH fondaparinux must administer subcutaneous injection warfarin require laboratory monitoring . Physical method increase blood flow leg vein effective reduce venous thrombosis high-risk hospitalized medical surgical patient . These method include : high intensity electrical calf stimulation surgery , graduate compression stocking intermittent pneumatic compression leg foot . Of , graduate compression stocking , effective , use hospital discharge . Graduated compression stocking , however , adapted fit leg shape , may improperly apply , tendency slip leg find uncomfortable many patient . High intensity electrical calf muscle stimulation painful use general anesthesia . AC power external pneumatic compression use patient fully immobilize . Thus , alternative convenient method need used immobilize partly mobile patient , particularly hospital discharge . We attempt overcome limitation currently available physical device use mild electrical stimulation plantar muscle foot . Each electrical discharge elicits foot twitch cause intrinsic foot muscle contract . This contraction compress plantar plexus vein , thereby increase venous velocity popliteal femoral vein transmit proximally leg vein . Our plantar foot stimulation device power 9-volt battery small enough inserted sock . It potential worn patient immobile , stand walking , therefore suitable use initial period immobilization throughout convalescence . In early study report mild electrical stimulation plantar foot muscle cause increase blood flow comparable produce direct calf stimulation . The aim new study determine , 4 hour period , mild electrical stimulation plantar foot muscle increase venous blood flow velocity degree intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) leg obese non-obese subject . MATERIALS AND METHODS IRB approval inform consent obtain subject . Forty healthy subject ( N = 40 ) age 50 80 participate study . Half subject ( N = 20 ) non-obese Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &lt; 30 . The half subject ( N = 20 ) obese BMI &gt; 30 . Exclusion criterion include prior history deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism , trauma surgery involve part low extremity . Subjects study 2 session . At session , subject receive either electrical foot stimulation intermittent pneumatic compression one foot . The low extremity serve control . Subjects receive either therapy one session therapy second session least 48 hour later . The right left leg subject randomly assign control leg study . The type therapy give first session also randomly assign . The study otherwise follow protocol use initial study electrical foot stimulation . Subjects seat 4 hour chair place fix distance apart . They constantly monitor throughout study ensure remain seated . Subjects allow use bathroom locate several foot away twice 4 hour period . During 4 hour study period subject offer maximum 16 ounce fluid normal lunch . Electrical foot stimulation produce surface electrode place sole foot plantar muscle group . Electrical stimulation deliver Focus™ Neuromuscular Stimulation System , Empi , Inc. ( St. Paul , MN . ) The crucial stimulus parameter : biphasic symmetrical square wave 50 pulse per second , phase duration 300 microsecond , start ramp time 2 second finish ramp time 2 second per stimulation cycle , stimulation cycle 12 second `` '' 48 second `` '' per minute . Stimulation increase intensity sufficient create slight visible muscle twitch . This level intensity cause evident discomfort subject first study . Subjects continually monitor throughout study indication discomfort . Intermittent pneumatic compression leg consist external intermittent pneumatic compression knee high device . A Tyco Healthcare Kendall Novamedix A-V impulse system® Model 6060 ( Mansfield , MA 02048 ) use . Operating parameter : 130mmHg impulse pressure 3 second impulse duration ; `` Program Preset 1 '' deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis . The compression follow approved standard patient protocol use institution detail `` Utilization Intermittent Pneumatic Compression ( IPC ) Stockings DVT Prophylaxis '' . Popliteal femoral venous peak blood flow velocity measure bilaterally use Doppler ultrasound device 0 , 15 , 120 , 240 minute . The ultrasound technician obtain Doppler study subject throughout study . All Doppler tracing read independent reader blind fashion . Immediately follow completion 4 hour session electrical foot stimulation intermittent pneumatic compression , subject ask complete brief questionnaire regard acceptance tolerance electrical stimulation intermittent pneumatic compression . STATISTICAL METHODS This study utilize repeated measure design two within group factor : time measurement , stimulation ( stimulation , control ) . Stimulation group [ electrical foot stimulation intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) ] independent . Blood flow measurement ( time = 120 , 240 ) analyze test mixed model . Within mixed model , group effect fix effect , subject parameter random effect . The primary research question non-inferiority experimental treatment ( electrical foot stimulation ) relative standard treatment ( intermittent pneumatic compression ) . The non-inferiority index 5.0 cm/sec ; index formulate prior analysis . The questionnaire result analyze use Fisher 's Exact test . P-values le 0.05 consider statistically significant . All analyse do SAS 9.1 , Cary , NC .</detailed_description>
