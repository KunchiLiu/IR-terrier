	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine degree Hypocol® ( Red Yeast Rice ) may lower low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -cholesterol European population . The effect Red Yeast Rice fast blood glucose inflammatory marker also investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Hypocol® Lipids Subjects With Mild Hypercholesterolemia Mildly Elevated Blood Glucose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical end-point trial demonstrate lower cholesterol level statins reduces incidence cardiovascular event mortality . Subgroup analyse large clinical study , West Scotland Coronary Prevention ( WOSCOP ) Cholesterol Recurrent Events ( CARE ) , suggest beneficial effect statin may extend mechanism beyond cholesterol reduction . A variety mechanism accounting effect suggest . Among , anti-inflammatory activity particularly attractive inflammation consider early step development atherosclerosis . Thus , statin therapy show low high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , plasma marker inflammation , hypercholesterolemic patient . Furthermore , statins may possess anti-inflammatory property ability reduce number inflammatory cell atherosclerotic plaque . Red Yeast Rice contain Lovastatin lower LDL-cholesterol . However , know degree Red Yeast Rice may lower LDL-cholesterol European population . Some report suggest effect Red Yeast Rice fast blood glucose unknown mechanism .</detailed_description>

Patients mild Type IIa , Type IIb IV hyperlipidaemia ( LDLcholesterol &gt; 3.0 mmol/L &lt; 6.0 mmol/L ) Fasting serum TG level &lt; 4.5 mmol/L Mildly elevate blood glucose define least one three follow criterion HbA1c % &gt; 5.5 % &lt; 7.5 % ; Fasting glucose &gt; 5.5 mmol/L ; Type 2 diabetes mellitus stable oral antihyperglycemic treatment 8 week HbA1c % &lt; 7.5 % time inclusion . If female , nonchildbearing potential , i.e. , postmenopausal ( define &gt; 12 month since last menstrual period ) surgically sterilise , use adequate barrier contraception childbearing potential . Currently take lipidlowering medication able complete 4week washout prior start dietary runin period . History active malignant disease last 5 year ( exclude treat basal cell carcinoma ) . History infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis B C. History alcohol and/or drug abuse . Have uncontrolled hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg ) . Patients take antihypertensive medication exclude provide maintain stable dose 3 month prior screen stable dose maintain throughout study . Have uncontrolled thyroid disease ( thyroid dysfunction control least 6 month prior screen permit ) . Known homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia know Type III hyperlipoproteinaemia ( familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia ) . Patients active liver disease hepatic dysfunction define elevation liver enzymes [ alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , gamma glutamyltransferase ( GGT ) alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) ] total bilirubin &gt; 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) time Visit 1 ( Week 4 ) Visit 3 ( Week 1 ) . Patients serum creatinine &gt; 180 µmol/L time Visit 1 ( Week 4 ) Visit 3 ( Week 1 ) Patients serious unstable medical psychological condition , opinion investigator , would compromise patient 's safety successful participation study . Patients start hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) less 6 month prior screen . Currently take investigational drug take part clinical trial within previous 30 day prior screen . These drug give patient 's participation study , must stop 6 week randomisation : lipid lower drug study medication , Cyclosporine A , medical treatment obesity ( i.e. , Orlistat , Sibutramine ) , oral anticoagulant . Special attention pay medication could interfere lipid profile ( i.e . oral corticosteroid , retinoids , thyroid hormone , thiazide derivative , diuretic , betablockers , hormone replacement therapy ) . It recommend modify medication within 6 week prior study start course trial ( unless medically require ) . All concomitant medication record .</criteria>
