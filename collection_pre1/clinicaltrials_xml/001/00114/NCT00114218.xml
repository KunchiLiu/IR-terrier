	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give gemcitabine together docetaxel work treat patient recurrent persistent uterine cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Docetaxel Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Uterine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity gemcitabine docetaxel patient recurrent persistent uterine carcinosarcoma . II . Determine nature degree toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute follow docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-60 patient accrue study within 1-4 year .</detailed_description>
