	<brief_title>131-I-TM-601 Study Adults With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II trial design two sequence . The first sequence , complete accrual open-label , dose escalation , multi-dose study treat 12 evaluable patient high-grade glioma . The second sequence currently open accrue eligible subject high-grade glioma . The trial open-label , randomize study accrue total 54 evaluable patient . Eligible subject randomize receive either 3 6 injection 131-I labeled TM-601 ( 131-I-TM-601 ) , weekly interval dose determine first sequence trial . Patients undergo debulking surgery placement ventricular access device tumor cavity administration 131I-TM-601 . Patients participate first sequence eligible participate second sequence study . High-grade glioma include ; glioblastoma multiforme , anaplastic astrocytoma , oligoastrocytoma gliosarcoma . Patients undergo follow-up clinical examination magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) assessment , define interval , 12 month first study dose .</detailed_description>
