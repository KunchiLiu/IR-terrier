	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II study well give sorafenib without gemcitabine work treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving sorafenib together gemcitabine may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate patient metastatic pancreatic cancer treat concurrent gemcitabine BAY43-9006 sequential BAY 43-9006 follow gemcitabine/BAY 43-9006 progression . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine six month overall survival rate , 3 month progression free survival rate , time tumor progression overall survival patient metastatic pancreatic cancer treat concurrent gemcitabine BAY43-9006 sequential BAY 43-9006 follow gemcitabine/BAY 43-9006 progression . II . To determine safety profile gemcitabine BAY43-9006 patient metastatic pancreatic cancer compare treat single agent BAY 43-9006 . III . To determine whether mRNA expression level gene involve gemcitabine pathway ( RR , dck , dcd ) gene involve Raf pathway ( cyclin D , VEGFR2 , p21 ) predict time progression , overall survival , response , patient metastatic pancreatic cancer treat concurrent gemcitabine BAY43-9006 sequential BAY 43-9006 follow gemcitabine/BAY 43-9006 progression . IV . To determine whether genomic polymorphism gene ( measure peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) involve gemcitabine pathway ( RR ) gene involve ra pathway ( VEGFR2 , cyclin D , p21 ) predict time progression , overall survival , tumor response , toxicity patient advance cancer pancreas treat concurrent gemcitabine BAY43-9006 sequential BAY 43-9006 follow gemcitabine/BAY 43-9006 progression . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Patients experience disease progression cross Arm II . ARM II : Patients receive oral sorafenib Arm I gemcitabine IV 100 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
