	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness EPOCH-R chemotherapy plus bortezomib treat mantle cell lymphoma , cancer white blood cell call lymphocyte . EPOCH-R consist drug prednisone , etoposide , doxorubicin vincristine , addition new drug call rituximab . In recent study patient newly diagnose mantle cell lymphoma , 92 percent complete remission disease treatment EPOCH-R . This study test whether add bortezomib `` maintenance therapy '' chemotherapy finish lengthen time disease relapse improve overall cure rate . Patients 18 year age old mantle cell lymphoma may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram , MUGA echocardiogram , image study biopsy determine extent disease , possible colonoscopy . Participants undergo treatment three part , follow : - Part 1 : Bortezomib alone : Patients receive 4 dos bortezomib 3 week . The drug inject vein 30 second . - Part 2 : EPOCH-R chemotherapy plus bortezomib : This phase treatment begin 3 4 week complete Part 1 . Treatment give outpatient basis six 3-week cycle , drug administer first 5 day cycle . Patients take prednisone mouth day 1 5 etoposide , doxorubicin , vincristine 96-hour infusion vein day 1 5 . The infused drug deliver lightweight , portable infusion pump . Rituximab give vein several hour day 1 immediately chemotherapy infusion begin . Bortezomib give vein 30 second day 1 rituximab day 4 . Cyclophosphamide give vein 15 minute day 5 immediately chemotherapy infusion complete . Patients teach self inject G-CSF , drug help boost white cell count chemotherapy . They inject drug skin ( like insulin shot ) 10 day cycle begin day 6 . Patients also take antibiotic help prevent infection chemotherapy . - Part 3 : Bortezomib alone : After complete EPOCH-R-B therapy , patient randomly assign receive receive bortezomib alone . The drug give 2 dos 5 day , break 16 day next dose . These 3-week cycle continue 18 month disease come back worsens . Patients assign group receive bortezomib offer drug disease relapse . During therapy , patient test perform bone marrow , tumor tissue , blood fluid look different gene protein may involve development lymphoma reaction immune system . A tissue biopsy do treatment begin day treatment start . Disease progress follow CT scan blood test . When treatment complete , patient whose cancer disappear schedule periodic follow-up examination test . Those whose disease remain recurs may offer participation another protocol appropriate one available return care local physician .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EPOCH-R Chemotherapy Plus Bortezomib Treat Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) present clinical challenge aggressive incurable chemotherapy . Therefore novel treatment approach need . MCL overexpression NF-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , transcription factor affect cell growth survival , cyclin D1 affect cell cycle growth . These protein appear involve pathogenesis MCL . Bortezomib , proteasome inhibitor inhibit NF-kappa B cyclin D1 , demonstrate activity patient relapse refractory MCL . Dose-adjusted-EPOCH-R excellent activity MCL , complete response ( CR ) rate 92 % , patient eventually relapse . Objective : Determine PFS OS DA-EPOCH-RB follow bortezomib maintenance versus observation . Eligibility : Diagnosis mantle cell lymphoma . No prior treatment except local radiation short course steroid control symptom , Age great equal 18 year old . Adequate major organ function unless impairment due lymphoma . Study Design : To assess clinical activity biological effect bortezomib , patient initially receive one cycle bortezomib alone sequential tumor biopsy microarray analysis . All patient receive Dose-adjusted ( DA ) -EPOCH-RB 6 cycle , least PR , follow randomization either immediate bortezomib maintenance x 18 month , observation , follow bortezomib progression occur . This study primary goal , describe progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival early bortezomib maintenance versus observation follow induction bortezomib follow DA-EPOCH-RB . Important secondary goal assess response toxicity bortezomib alone DA-EPOCH-RB , evaluate time progression receive bortezomib follow progression observation arm , assess biological effect bortezomib untreated MCL .</detailed_description>

Female subject pregnant breastfeeding . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( betahCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman Male subject agrees use acceptable method contraception duration study . No history prior invasive malignancy past 5 year No know involvement central nervous system lymphoma No history hypersensitivity boron mannitol . Patient receive investigational drug 14 day enrollment . No serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study .
