	<brief_summary>This study examine recombinant , , produce genetic engineering , protective antigen ( rPA ) bring antibody neutralize anthrax toxin could therefore predict offer protection anthrax . Today , anthrax rarely encounter United States , since introduction vaccine cattle 1930s . A human vaccine license 1970 . Vaccination anthrax confine people risk , wool sorter veterinarian . However , rise prospect B. anthracis use weapon lead routine administration anthrax vaccine member arm force . Adults good health may eligible study . The involvement 300 adult plan . Participants general physical exam test vital sign . There also collection blood chemistry hematology ; urinalysis ; test HIV , hepatitis B C , liver function ; pregnancy test , applicable . On random basis , patient receive one rPA formulation . Two dos rPA evaluate , 10 microgram ( ( Micro ) g ) 20 ( Micro ) g. This evaluation aim establish safety desirable level dosage . Patients receive one injection vaccine , administer leave shoulder leave thigh . About 30 minute later , temperature take , injection site inspect . Rare severe reaction could occur extreme sensitivity vaccine . However , occurrence extremely rare follow vaccine , dangerous symptom , effectively treat medication available patient clinic . If significant abnormal result , patient may return home . About 6 hour later daily 7 day , take temperature examine injection site . The vaccine may cause temporary discomfort site injection , participant may experience mild fever 1 2 day vaccination . Patients receive diary card , digital thermometer , instruction take temperature measure redness swell injection site , well record ache , muscle pain , sensitivity light 7 day . They examine clinic 72 hour follow vaccination also 7th day fever 100.4 , swell 2 inch , request exam . Meanwhile , clinic staff member call patient discuss finding . Then patient receive second third injection vaccine 2-month interval . There also interview patient ' health visit clinic , plus monitor vaccination 6 hour 7 day . One year later , patient receive fourth injection vaccine . Direct benefit participant study guarantee , although antibody response predict . The result study help development improve vaccine anthrax .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anthrax rarely encounter U.S. since introduction attenuate vaccine cattle 1930 's . A vaccine human , compose cell-free preparation absorb onto alum , licensed 1970 successful clinical trial . Vaccination anthrax U.S. confine individual risk wool sorter veterinarians prospect raise B. anthracis use weapon Iraq war . Now anthrax vaccine administer routinely armed force . Interest improve vaccine stimulate use B. anthracis spores bioterrorism . The active component investigational vaccine call protective antigen . When B. anthracis invades host tissue , protective antigen activate two protein form anthrax toxin . The symptom anthrax cause toxin . Alone , protective antigen know toxicity . The gene protein isolate change specifically improve property vaccine-this recombinant protective antigen ( rPA ) elicit antibody neutralize anthrax toxin , thereby , predict confer protection . This first study investigational rPA vaccine human . The broad objective characterize safety serum antibody level different dos formulation rPA comparison license anthrax vaccine , AVA .</detailed_description>
