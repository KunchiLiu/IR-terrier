	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth pancreatic cancer block blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Capecitabine may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Bevacizumab may make tumor cell sensitive chemotherapy radiation therapy . Giving chemotherapy bevacizumab radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . This phase II trial study well give capecitabine bevacizumab together radiation therapy follow gemcitabine bevacizumab work treat patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine , Bevacizumab , Radiation Therapy Followed By Gemcitabine Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare 1-year overall survival patient unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer treat capecitabine , bevacizumab , radiotherapy follow maintenance therapy comprise gemcitabine bevacizumab historical control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine frequency serious unacceptable adverse event patient treat regimen . II . Determine response rate patient treat regimen . III . Determine progression-free survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Chemoradiotherapy bevacizumab : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily undergo radiotherapy daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 , 36-38 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 . Patients undergo reevaluation 3-4 week completion chemoradiotherapy bevacizumab . Patients evidence disease progression proceed maintenance therapy . Patients mark response may undergo surgery discretion attend surgeon proceed maintenance therapy approximately 4-8 week later . Maintenance therapy : Beginning within 4-7 week completion chemoradiotherapy bevacizumab , patient receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 bevacizumab IV 30 minute day 1 15 provide blood count return normal . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 82 patient accrue study within 16 month .</detailed_description>
