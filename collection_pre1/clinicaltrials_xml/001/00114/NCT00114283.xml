	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ditosylate Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective study estimate objective response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck follow treatment GW572016 ( lapatinib ditosylate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Secondary objective study estimate time progression , describe adverse event profile , obtain preliminary assessment change pre- versus post-treatment measurement select biomarkers tumor cell patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
