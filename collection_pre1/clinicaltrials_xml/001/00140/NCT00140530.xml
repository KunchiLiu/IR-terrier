	<brief_title>Nonpolymer- Polymer-Based Drug-Eluting Stents Restenosis ( ISAR-TEST-1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug-eluting stent represent major advance treatment restenosis . They dramatically reduce need repeat revascularization procedure , , thanks excellent result obtain various patient subset , device use almost 90 % stent implantation procedure perform US hospital . Along increase number patient receive drug-eluting stent availability long-term follow-up data , concern arisen regard safety device . At core concern potential increase inflammatory thrombogenic response life-threatening consequence associate polymer employ delivery antirestenotic agent . A grow interest show polymer-free stent microporous surface alternative stent employ polymeric coat local drug delivery . Recently , develop mobile system enable coat catheterization laboratory polymeric free stent different drug dos combination . Using porcine coronary model restenosis , find coat rapamycin polymer-free microporous stent feasible effectively reduce neointimal proliferation . More recently , clinical study efficacy several dos rapamycin assess , show non-polymer coating rapamycin safe lead dose-dependent reduction restenosis . While advantage derive lack polymeric cover on-site coat rapamycin-eluting stent readily understandable , relative efficacy compare commercially available polymer-based drug-eluting stent yet evaluate . Comparison : Polymer-free microporous stent coat rapamycin versus standard polymer-based , paclitaxel-eluting stent</detailed_description>
