Doses 100 mg gel rub skin increase testosterone level 30-40 nmoles/L within 8-20 hour . Levels return baseline study within 1-2 day cessation chronic treatment although return baseline single application study . A recent study [ Shifren , et al . 2000 ] show transdermal continuous patch testosterone dose 150micro g 300micro g vs. placebo daily 12 week study improve sexual health include desire , arousal , orgasm frequency woman surgically induced menopause oophorectomy . Blood level reach 3.0nmoles/L ( 5x baseline ) . Shrifren et al [ 2000 ] find significant side effect transdermal sustain testosterone treatment . Another study [ Goldstat , et al . 2003 ] look transdermal testosterone give gel , 10mg day give 12 week double-blind design 31 pre-menopausal woman mean age 40 year . The woman enter study present low sexual desire . Testosterone treatment result significant improvement psychological general well sexual self rating scale . No adverse effect report . Blood level testosterone increase 2.5 time baseline 2.6nmoles/L . Despite absence side effect report small study relatively short period time do till woman testosterone treatment , treatment long term disorder diminish sexual desire reasonable concerned androgenizing side effect . Therefore , would extremely useful testosterone could give prn ( need ) basis sexual intercourse . Recently Tuiten et al [ 2000 ] study normal volunteer woman vaginal flow measure use photoplethysmography addition questionnaire data sexual arousal exposure erotic movie pre treatment sublingual testosterone vs. placebo single dose sublingually 0.5mg . Testosterone significantly enhance vaginal blood flow response erotic movie also subjective sexual interest , desire arousal movie . The psychophysiological effect maximal 4 hour sublingual testosterone . Blood level 25nmol/L testosterone , 10 time baseline , maximal 10 minute sublingual delivery return baseline within 90 minute . This study suggest may possible give transdermal testosterone 4-8 hour intercourse couple female partner suffers low sexual interest desire /or difficulty arousal , couple able plan intercourse several hour advance , possible many couple , base clinical experience . In couple androgen could give prn basis possibility side effect long term use greatly reduce . We therefore propose study . Methods The study do double-blind randomize crossover study . Women enter study pre-menopausal age 21-40 diagnosis hypo-active sexual disorder experience sexologist diplomate Israel Society Sexual Therapy . Patients accept study plan intercourse partner . Patients unable offer 3 session counsel sexual communication still unable plan intercourse 3 session exclude study . Patients accept study write informed consent give 8 packet Testosteron Gel ( Androgel ) 50mg show spread gel skin low abdomen upper shoulder . They tell use gel twice weekly one month . Patients instructed spread gel 4-8 hour plan intercourse . The patient instruct shower remove remain gel intercourse . After intercourse fill Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale ( ASEX ) - Female [ McGahuey , et al . 2000 ] . At baseline end month interview rat month whole use Sexual Function Questionnaire ( SFQ-V1 ) [ Quirk , et al . 2002 ] . They give package 8 placebo gel instruction invite back month another rating . Half woman give placebo switch active androgen . We request permission advertise internet and/or newspaper symptomatic volunteer study . Possible ( improbable due low dos prn use ) side effect include : Increase total cholesterol , high density lipoprotein cholesterol , low density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglyceride , fast glucose insulin ; change blood count change liver function test ( serum aspartate aminotransferase , serum glutamyltransferase , serum albumin ) ; hirsutism acne , increase facial hair loss hair ; diarrhea , nipple breast enlargement breast pain ; headache ; elevation blood pressure , change mood aggressiveness . Slight local skin irritation dryness skin . However , state , side effect unlikely use prn treatment . Dose : The recent study Shifren et al [ 2000 ] use continuous transdermal patch reach blood level 3.0nmoles/L ( 5x baseline ) post-menopausal woman , side effect 12 week . Goldstat et al [ 2003 ] look transdermal gel 10mg , apply daily wash day wear , 12 week side effect pre-menopausal woman . They reach blood level 2.6nmoles/L ( 2.5x baseline ) . Tuiten et al [ 2000 ] use sublingual one time dose 0.5mg , reach peak blood level 25nmoles/L ( 10x baseline ) 10 minute return baseline within 90 minute . We propose minimize side effect maximize benefit single application use 50mg testosterone transdermal gel use twice week . Blood level dose Wang et al [ 2000 ] 20nmoles/L . Since patient instruct shower intercourse , blood level exist 4-8 hour twice week . Based Tuiten et al [ 2000 ] short pulse testosterone level necessary achieve psychophysiological effect , thus request permission use dose 50mg Androgel would high use daily chronically woman .</detailed_description>
