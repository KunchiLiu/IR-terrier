	<brief_summary>To determine whether VISUDYNE therapy combination 4 mg intravitreal triamcinolone reduce average loss baseline best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) compare Visudyne therapy without intravitreal triamcinolone 12 month subject occult subfoveal minimally classic subfoveal CNV secondary AMD . The intravitreal triamcinolone give either 1 mg 4 mg dose . This study also evaluate safety Visudyne therapy combination intravitreal triamcinolone . An interim statistical readout perform first 60 patient complete 6 month follow-up evaluation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of Combined VISUDYNE Therapy With Kenalog In CNV Secondary To Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , single-masked ( VA examiner , angiographic grader ) , multi-center , Phase 2 study 3 arm compare VISUDYNE therapy combination intravitreal injection either 1 mg 4 mg triamcinolone VISUDYNE therapy without intravitreal triamcinolone 1:1:1 ratio . Re-treatment may administer 3 month interval (  14 day ) evidence CNV leakage detect fluorescein angiography . At baseline 3 month ( + 14 day ) interval patient undergo follow assessment : ophthalmic examination , best correct visual acuity , fluorescein angiography , color fundus photography . The eligibility criterion inclusion study re-treatment patient base fluorescein angiography . Patients receive treatment day-1 , week-3 , week-6 follow treatment best correct ETDRS visual acuity test ophthalmic . Those patient re-treated best correct ETDRS visual acuity test ophthalmic examination week-6 follow re-treatment evaluation visit . Adverse event assess throughout study . Expected time recruitment 6 month ; patient follow period 12 month study</detailed_description>

Subjects may randomize treatment : 1 . Have evidence predominantly classic CNV , clinically significant intraocular inflammation , angioid streak , presume ocular histoplasmosis syndrome , axial myopia great –6 diopter , precursor choroidal neovascularization 2 . Have additional eye disease compromise visual acuity study eye . 3 . Are receive require chronic concomitant therapy systemic topical ocular corticosteroid NSAIDS . Chronic concomitant therapy define multiple dos take daily 3 consecutive day time course 12month study ) . A low dose ( 100 mg po qd ) aspirin ( ASA ) take prophylaxis MI and/or stroke permit study . 4 . Are use coumadin . 5 . Have know hypersensitivity verteporfin triamcinolone 6 . Have CNV involve geometric center foveal avascular zone , determine color photography fluorescein angiography 7 . Are unable photographed document CNV , e.g . due medium opacity , allergy fluorescein dye lack venous access 8 . Have lens opacity , investigator ’ opinion , would progress course study would affect central vision study eye . Such cataract may remove least 2 month enter subject study 9 . Have history treatment CNV , confluent laser photocoagulation , study eye ( e.g. , PDT , submacular surgery , radiotherapy macular scatter “ grid ” laser photocoagulation 10 . Are participate another clinical trial require followup examination receive receive experimental treatment CNV investigational new drug within 12 week prior start study treatment 11 .
