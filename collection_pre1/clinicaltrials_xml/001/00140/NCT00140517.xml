	<brief_summary>Plasmodium falciparum resistance chloroquine ( CQ ) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) continue spread , impede control important disease . CQ SP still commonly use antimalarial drug malaria prevention pregnancy might make less effective resistance . However , treatment prophylaxis regimen use may also create condition select resistant malaria parasite strain . A good understanding relationship chemoprophylaxis regimen resistance would helpful improve chemoprophylaxis malaria pregnancy . This work aim improve use chemoprophylaxis pregnancy determine whether relationship use standard prophylactic regimen CQ SP occurrence P. falciparum resistant strain pregnant woman . The study consist 2 part . The first part randomize trial compare 3 chemoprophylactic treatment group : - weekly CQ initial presumptive CQ treatment , - CQ intermittent presumptive treatment give standard dose 2nd 3rd trimester , respectively SP intermittent presumptive treatment give single dose 2nd 3rd trimester , respectively . These treatment group also compare group woman deliver health centre participate study . The second part clinical trial assessment clinical parasitological efficacy CQ SP treatment pregnant woman present uncomplicated malaria attack . The study conduct October 2002 March 2005 health centre Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso malaria transmission seasonal resistance CQ SP low .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Overall objective : To improve use malaria chemoprophylaxis pregnancy . Specific objective : To investigate effect weekly CQ , intermittent presumptive treatment CQ , SP placental , peripheral , cord parasitaemia P. falciparum resistance status primigravida secundigravidae . To determine relationship carriage P. falciparum resistant strain malaria morbidity ( attack anaemia ) pregnancy . To determine clinical parasitological efficacy CQ SP primigravida secundigravidae . MATERIAL AND METHODS The study conduct peripheral health centre Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso , West Africa . The large part country tropical savannah rainy season June October ( average rainfall : 1000 mm per year , mean temperature &gt; 25°C ) , cold dry season November February , ( min . temp . 15°C ) hot dry season March May . Malaria transmission seasonal ( June December ) major mosquito vector A. gambiae , A. funestus A. arabiensis . Malaria morbidity represent 30 50 % febrile illnesses frequent reason health centre attendance hospital admission.Since 's first notification 1986 , P. falciparum resistance CQ increase slowly considerable variation space time resistance SP remain low . CQ clinical failure general less 20 % 6-59 month child parasitological resistance around 30 % . Malaria prevention pregnancy give weekly 300 mg CQ follow presumptive initial treatment recommend national malaria control programme ( MOH ) . ANC service health centre provide pregnant woman CQ haematinic . The health centre 'Centre médical Paul VI ' peri-urban health facility Ouagadougou . It comprise general outpatient consultation service , paediatric maternity ward , laboratory.Patients come peri-urban district neighbour village . Study design : ) Comparative randomize trial . Three group study . Pregnant woman ( primigravidae secundigravidae 12 24 week pregnancy ) randomly assign , use random number list , treatment group A C define : - Group A : pregnant woman receive weekly 300 mg CQ prophylaxis curative dose ( 10mg/kg day 1 2 +5mg/kg day 3 ) first visit ; - Group B : pregnant woman receive presumptive CQ treatment 2nd 3rd trimester pregnancy ( 10mg/kg day 1 2 +5mg/kg day 3 ) ; - Group C : pregnant woman receive presumptive SP treatment 2nd 3rd trimester pregnancy ( 25mg sulfadoxine + 1,25mg pyrimethamine/kg single dose ) . Another group compose primiparous secundiparous woman part study come deliver health centre ( group D ) receive chloroquine prophylaxis pregnancy consider reflect normal situation act control group . These woman include first three month study . At inclusion 1. personal information , anthropometric measure , clinical data , obstetrical history , record 2. fingerprick blood collect thick thin blood smear , Hb filter paper subsequent PCR test 3 . Treatment : The single dose SP 3 day CQ treatment administer supervise research team . Study participant invite come follow visit time feel sick need health service . Follow-up visit begin second third trimester include : 1. clinical parasitological examination . The health event since previous visit record , Hb 2. provide chemoprophylaxis treatment accordance treatment group . At delivery , follow data record : 1. delivery outcome ( birth weight , mode delivery , APGAR score ) 2. mother 's peripheral blood thick blood smear , Hb filter paper PCR 3. placental blood thick blood smear , collection filter paper PCR 4. cord blood thick blood smear . If positive blood collect filter paper PCR b ) Clinical trial assessment clinical parasitological efficacy CQ SP pregnant woman . Primigravidae secundigravidae woman present uncomplicated malaria attack randomly treat CQ SP regularly follow assess clinical parasitological efficacy . A molecular analysis parasite gene mutation confer resistance chloroquine ( PfCRT ) , antifolates ( DHFR , DHPS ) perform . The patient randomly assign treatment either CQ SP . They followed-up 28 day accordance WHO protocol . The follow criterion clinical ( body temperature ) parasitological ( peripheral parasitaemia ) . Sample size : ) Comparative randomize trial : Considering prevalence placenta parasitaemia 35 % pregnant woman get prophylaxis , 24 % woman weekly CQ prophylaxis , 15 % woman intermittent presumptive treatment CQ 5 % woman intermittent presumptive treatment SP , use significance level 5 % , power 80 % 20 % drop-out , group include 200 subject . ) Drug efficacy assessment pregnant woman Considering proportion pregnant woman clinical failure 10-15 % chloroquine , use significance level 5 % , power 80 % 20 % drop-out , sample 42 subject include . Methods : 1 . Comparative randomized trial : Pregnant woman recruit ANC unit health facility fulfil follow inclusion criterion give oral informed consent . Inclusion criterion : - primo secundigravidae - see 12th 24th week gestation - non 'at risk pregnancy ' ( multiple pregnancy , obstetric misproportions , previous caesarean , high blood pressure , diabetes , clinical sign AIDS . - stay neighbour district village - ability come follow-up delivery . Exclusion criterion : - At risk pregnancy - Severe systemic disease - Wish withdraw participation . Inclusion follow-up procedure : The study aim procedure clearly explain meet inclusion criteria.Enrolled woman register personal health file create , fill enrolment , follow-up , delivery . Each woman give health record booklet present visit .

Drug efficacy assessment pregnant woman The subject recruit ANC adult outpatient unit health facility . Those meet inclusion criterion select requested participate ( oral inform consent ) randomly allocate CQ SP treatment Inclusion criterion : • primo secundigravidae 12 24 week gestation • pregnant woman without 'at risk pregnancy ' • axillary body temperature &gt; 37.5°C &lt; 39.5°C • clinical sign severe malaria • mono infection P. falciparum density &gt; 2000 trophozoites /µl blood - sign febrile disease - stay neighbour district village Exclusion criterion : - severe malaria - febrile disease - previous side effect CQ SP consumption - loss follow . Inclusion follow-up procedure : Enrolled woman record : date , identity number , name , age , profession , address , temperature , body weight , parasitaemia , haemoglobin concentration , treatment , follow-up temperature , parasitaemia Hb , observation , result test . Every subject ask come precise date follow . Those lose follow actively search next day . Methods : The WHO 28 day `` assessment therapeutic efficacy antimalarial drug uncomplicated falciparum malaria area intense transmission protocol '' use , adapt pregnant woman . Data handle statistical analysis All data record pre-designed tested questionnaire and/or register . Then progressively enter , clear , check analyse use SPSS software . For comparative randomize trial , general analysis aim describe study sample calculation variable mean ( e.g . age , parity , parasite density , haemoglobin concentration , birthweight ) , frequency clinical data malaria attack , clinical result , delivery outcomes , mutation profile . Then comparative analysis compare proportion main variable different treatment group ( peripheral , placenta , cord blood parasitaemia , LBW , prevalence resistant strain , mutation profile , clinical parasitological response ) use chi-square test . The mean ( birthweight , haemoglobin concentration , number clinical attack ) compare group t-test one way analysis variance . Stratified multivariate analysis test use necessary .</detailed_description>
