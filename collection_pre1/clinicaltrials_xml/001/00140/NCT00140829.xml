	<brief_summary>Cerebellar ataxia ( CA ) spastic paraplegia ( SP ) genetically clinically heterogeneous . More 40 loci already know number phenotype even great suggest genetic heterogeneity . These progressive disorder often severe fatal , due absence specific therapy . The SPATAX network combine experience European clinician scientist work group disease . Over past year , assemble large collection family achieve number task ( initiation clinical genetic database , distribution DNA participate laboratory , map three new locus , refinement several locus ) . In addition clinician Europe Mediterranean country , play major role collect family accord evaluation tool develop validated SPATAX member , group include major European laboratory devote elucidation molecular basis disorder . Each laboratory centralize family subtype autosomal recessive ( AR ) CA ( n=116 ) SP ( n=207 ) order efficiently map identify responsible gene ( ) . Genome-wide scan already underway 61 family . Given expertise participant , researcher expect map identify several gene course project . The spectrum mutation phenotype/genotype correlation analyse thanks unique series patient various phenotype . The knowledge gain immediately applicable patient term improve positive diagnosis , follow-up appropriate genetic counselling . In long term , model genetic entity develop order understand pathophysiology identify new target treatment . The series patient assembled precise knowledge natural history facilitate implantation therapeutic trial base rational approach .</brief_summary>
