	<brief_summary>- Objectives - Primary objective : To evaluate patient advanced follicular lymphoma benefit maintenance therapy rituximab induction response chemotherapy plus rituximab comparison maintenance therapy - Secondary objective : To evaluate response rate , event drive survival endpoint ( EFS , PFS , OS ) quality life four different chemotherapy regimen combine rituximab , without maintenance rituximab , first line treatment advance stage follicular lymphoma . - Study Design This international open-label , multicentre , randomize study two treatment phase . In induction phase patient respond 1st line induction treatment order eligible randomization second phase maintenance treatment observation . After maintenance period patient include follow phase 3 year .</brief_summary>
