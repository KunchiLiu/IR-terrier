	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : 1 . Delayed ischaemia deficit subarachnoid haemorrhage Seven thousand patient suffer SAH year within UK young adult ( &lt; 55 year ) equally affect . Cerebral vasospasm related cerebral ischemia major cause delay morbidity mortality patient survive initial SAH episode . Previous study reveal immediate low cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) accompany SAH , particularly coma . However , good grade patient low CBF often delay associate cerebral vasospasm [ Knuckey 1985 ] . Vasospasm often precede onset DID commonly occur 2nd week SAH [ Knuckey 1985 ] . Autoregulation accomplish reflex mechanism reflect intrinsic ability cerebral vessel dilate attempt maintain constant CBF face poor cerebral perfusion . Following SAH , impairment autoregulation affect prognosis [ Lam 2000 ] . Indeed , daily assessment autoregulation help identify patient high risk clinical deterioration [ Smielewski 1997 ] . Autoregulation conveniently measure non-invasively bedside use transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) . Direct measure middle cerebral artery flow velocity ( FV ) predictive DID ; elevate mean FV ( &gt; 120cms/sec ) increase ratio mFV MCA extracranial internal carotid artery ( ICA ) ( Lindegaard ratio &gt; 3 ) associate cerebral vasospasm high incidence adverse event [ Lindegaard 1988 ] . The rapid increase FV time also predictive , relationship FV spontaneous change blood pressure ( correlation index Mx ) [ Czosnyka 2000 ] . A sophisticated measure abnormal cerebrovascular haemodynamics involve transient hyperaemic response test ( THRT ) [ Giller 1991 ] . This use routinely department demonstrate relationship abnormal THRT clinical outcome follow SAH [ Lam 2000 ] . The THRT assess FV response manual carotid compression ( Figure 1 ) repeat within minute provide reliable readily accessible method assess autoregulation . When THRT use day-to-day assessment patient , test provide valuable monitor sequential change autoregulation . 2 . Autoregulation SAH Autoregulation often impair SAH , even patient present good clinical grade [ Voldby 1985 ] . An abnormal THRT response commonly develop either early day 0 3 ( primary ) , late around day 7 14 ( secondary ) initial bleed . Primary abnormality THRT far common poor grade patient , secondary abnormality occur regularly initially good grade patient later develop sign DID clinical deterioration [ Ratsep 2002 ] . Routine daily assessment autoregulation TCD help identify patient high risk DID . This delay evolution abnormal autoregulation response well grade patient present opportunity introduce early therapeutic strategy design offset potentially harmful effect . Indeed , routine use plasma expansion already adopt aim mind [ Origitano 1990 ] . 3 . Therapeutic opportunity ; recombinant human erythropoietin ? Recently attention focus potential therapeutic role endogenous brain protein possess neuroprotective property . This neuroprotective approach use erythropoietin ( EPO ) aim protect potentially viable brain tissue apoptosis [ Ehrenreich 2002 ] . EPO , 34-kDa hydrophobic sialoglycoprotein , responsible survival , proliferation , differentiation commit erythroid progenitor cell . It produce foetal liver adult kidney , accelerate hypoxia [ Lacombe 1999 ] . Because pre-formed EPO storage , therefore , control EPO gene transcription involve complex interaction hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ( HIF-1 ) , transcription factor activate hypoxia , hypoglycaemia , seizures [ Lacombe 1999 ] . EPO receptor ( EPO-R ) , like member haematopoietic receptor family , possess endogenous tyrosine kinase activity . However , close association Jak2 tyrosine kinase induce rapid tyrosine phosphorylation number proteins [ Lacombe 1999 ] . Hypoxia induce increase EPO-R expression , turn cause increase sensitivity EPO [ Chin 2000 ] . Both EPO EPO-R ubiquitously distribute neural tissue [ Digicaylioglu 1995 ] . Except large vessel , EPO-R abundantly distribute astrocyte , neuron , cerebral capillary endothelium [ Marti 1996 , Yamaji 1996 , Bernaudin 1999 , Brines 2000 ] . Immunohistochemistry show distribution EPO-R consistent anatomical location blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) [ Brines 2000 ] . Such condensed distribution EPO-R within surround cerebral capillary imply small amount EPO sufficient mediate physiological function central nervous system [ Chin 2000 ] . The increased production EPO response hypoxia anemia astrocytes neuron corresponds occur kidney liver [ Masuda 1994 ] . Thus , hypoxia , EPO act directly cerebral capillary endothelial cell angiogenic factor paracrine mechanism astrocytes endocrine mechanism kidney [ Digicaylioglu 1995 ] . EPO protect nervous tissue condition characterise relative deficiency ATP [ Brine 2000 ] . This neuroprotective effect achieve several mechanism . 1 . EPO induce expression several glycolytic enzyme , re-directs energy metabolism toward favour survival oxygen deprivation [ Digicaylioglu 1995 ] . 2 . During cerebral ischemia , N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor-mediated glutamate toxicity major cause neuron death [ Morishita 1997 ] . Glutamate toxicity part mediate nitric oxide ( NO ) . EPO up-regulates expression antioxidant enzymes transcriptional level vascular smooth muscle cell [ Kusano 1999 ] , potentially protect neuron NO-generating agent [ Sakanaka 1998 ] . Furthermore , EPO suppress increase Ca2+ concentration induce glutamate nitric oxide ( NO ) -induced apoptosis [ Morishita 1997 ] . EPO show provide neurotrophic [ Konishi 1993 ] angiogenic effect [ Yamaji 1996 ] , potential neural regeneration [ Siren 2001 ] . These effect dose-dependent unrelated nerve growth factor ( NGF ) [ Konoshi Y 1993 ] . The distribution EPO EPO-R correspond sequence histopathological change cerebral ischemia/infarction . In acute hypoxia ( cardiac arrest ) , strong immunoreactivity EPO find vascular endothelium , EPOR express strongly neuron [ Siren 2001 ] . After cerebral ischemia , EPO play important role angiogenesis glial reaction . EPO immunoreactivity appear endothelium , intravascular inflammatory cell neuron penumbra . Also EPO-R express neuron , astrocytes endothelial cell [ Bernaudin 1999 , Siren 2001 ] . Because expression EPO-R precede up-regulation EPO synthesis [ Bernaudin 1999 ] , sensitivity EPO increase [ Chin 2000 ] . In contrast , change detectable non-ischemic cortex [ Bernaudin 1999 ] , indicate increase potential EPO act neuron risk [ Siren 2001 ] . By protect endothelial cell apoptosis , EPO increase cerebral blood flow , improve microcirculation penumbra , improve tissue oxygenation angiogenesis , thus significantly reduce infarct volume [ Bernaudin 1999 , Siren 2001 ] . This angiogenesis correspond find hypoxic condition exposure high altitude , brain increase mean microvascular density [ Lamanna JC 1992 ] . In old infarct , EPO EPO-R strongly express reactive astrocyte . Thus EPO system may participate repair process [ Siren 2001 ] . The persistent up-regulation EPO production astrocyte stroke also provide rapidly available source EPO make neuron tolerate ischemia [ Siren 2001 ] . These endogenous neuroprotective mechanism insufficient cope acute injury , severe ischemic insult exhaust EPO/EPO-R neuroprotective capacity brain latency de novo synthesis long . Clinical application EPO administer rapidly provide additional neuroprotection [ Brines 2000 ] . Epoetin beta 165-aa glycoprotein manufacture use recombinant DNA technology , contain identical amino acid sequence isolate human EPO possess biological activity . It similar endogenous EPO except minor difference pattern 4 carbohydrate chain . [ Brine 2000 ] The recombinant human EPO widely use treat anaemia associate chronic renal insufficiency , HIV infection , cancer , surgery , excellent safety record wide clinical practice . 4 . Why 90,000 IU Epoetin beta ? The safety efficacy epoetin beta treat acute stroke ( within 8 hour ) human confirm double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial , use high dose intravenous epoetin beta ( 3,3000 IU/50 ml/30min/day , three day , cumulative dose 100,000IU ) [ Ehrenreich 2002 ] . No associated change blood pressure , haematocrit , haemoglobin , red blood cell count find trial [ Ehrenreich 2002 ] . Only reticulocyte count increase 29.2 ±10.0 % 4th day last dose EPO [ Ehrenreich 2002 ] . This systemic administration EPO also lead 60- 100-fold increase CSF level require breakdown blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) [ Ehrenreich 2002 ] . Patients treat EPO low earlier surge serum S100 ( secrete reactive astrocytes functional disturbance membrane integrity brain cell membrane ) thereafter return within normal limit sooner placebo [ Ehrenreich 2002 ] . This early return serum S100 towards normal level implies inflammatory process and/or BBB integrity improve rapidly systemic EPO therapy [ Ehrenreich 2002 ] . The beneficial effect stroke patient continue throughout 30 day , particularly moderate severe stroke [ Ehrenreich 2002 ] . By activation endothelial EPO receptor , circulate EPO may appose inflammatory pathway cerebral artery attenuate vasospasm induce SAH . In vivo study find systemic administration EPO ( i.p . 1000units/kg ) immediately SAH improve survival motor function [ Buemi 2000 ] . The systemic delivery EPO advantage universally available capillary endothelium whole brain , contrast intraventricular injection , highly localized practical clinical setting [ Brines 2000 ] . Because concentration EPO CSF independent serum level extent BBB disruption patient suffer aneurysmal SAH , EPO CSF predominantly produce brain order match need [ Springborg 2003 ] . Therefore , early activation endothelial EPO-R may potential therapeutic strategy , fact prove reduction S100 protein CSF ( marker brain damage ) restoration cerebral autoregulation ( least 48 hour ) systemic administration recombinant human EPO [ Springborg 2002 ] . Therefore , 90,000 Iuof epoetin beta use achieve maximal effect CBF autoregulation SAH patient study . QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED : We wish address follow hypothesis SAH patient : 1 . Systemic treatment epoetin beta ( 90,000IU ) safe follow SAH 2 . Systemic treatment epoetin beta reduces incidence abnormal FV cerebral autoregulation follow SAH . 3 . Systemic treatment epoetin beta reduces incidence acute neurological deterioration follow SAH If primary endpoint improve epoetin beta therapy , data use formulate power calculation design Phase III clinical outcome study . However , assess clinical outcome end trial discharge detect indication adverse effect EPO therapy . Randomisation procedure : Following informed consent , patient angiography-positive aneurismal SAH randomise receive either intravenous epoetin beta 30,000IU placebo ( 0.9 % saline ) 50ml/30min , three time first week SAH ( total dose 90,000IU ) . The number group 40 . For blinding , Pharmacy Manufacture Unit ( PMU ) prepare number identical vial contain either saline ( 0.9 % NaCl ) epoetin beta reconstitute saline . The vial randomly assign patient upon enrollment content vial know PMU . Trial medication start soon possible within 72 hour ictus . As approximately 70 % aneurysms treat open clipping , remainder endovascular coil , consider method treatment represent contaminate factor , include final analysis . Location , size , morphology culprit aneurysm believe affect outcome institution . Following randomisation start trial therapy clinical management patient routine . Arterial blood pressure continuously monitor ( Finapress , via radial arterial line ) . Safety : The full blood cell count , reticulocyte count , blood viscosity , coagulation profile , serum biochemistry , serum iron level , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) time admission check clinical routine . Although EPO effect erythropoiesis thrombopoiesis , associate deterioration adverse event observe short-term treatment [ Ehrenreich 2002 ] . However , face abnormality trial drug stop safety committee inform . A safety committee ( chair Dr Ken Smith , Consultant nephrologist ) review safety data monthly interval , concern arise , patient-by-patient basis . Primary outcome measure : Vasospasm abnormalities AR : Trial patient examine daily TCD ( DWL , Germany ) use 2-MHz probe mount purposed head frame two week since SAH ictus . The systolic , diastolic , mean FV record ( trans-temporal ) single user ( MT ) . Vasospasm define mean FV &gt; 120 cm/sec Lindegaard ratio &gt; 3 [ Lindegaard 1988 ] . The regression index ( Mx ) mean FV spontaneous change ABP calculate . Two carotid compression last 5 second perform . The criterion acceptable THRT include sudden decrease middle cerebral artery FV onset compression , stable TCD signal compression , minimum 30 % decrease FV blood pressure instability [ Smielewski 1997 ] . The THRT ratio ( THRR ) calculate use formula : THRR = FVs ( hyperaemia ) / FVs ( baseline ) , FVs denote systolic FV ( Figure 1 ) . THRR classify normal ( ≥l.10 ) impair ( &lt; 1.10 ) , repeat 2 minute later . The average value two test record . Quality issue concern THRT response extensively evaluate laboratory [ Smielewski 1997 ] . Secondary endpoint measure : Development DID : The clinical progress patient monitor daily . The development focal neurological deficit and/or drop Glasgow Coma Scale 2 point follow vasospasm criterion adopt define episode DID [ Pickard 1989 ] . Other factor affect consciousness , include systemic infection infection central nervous system , record final analysis . Clinical outcome assess end trial time discharge . Durations hospitalisation NCCU stay observe . Statistical Analysis : The analysis perform use statistical software , STATA ( Texas , USA ) . Data express mean±standard deviation . The multivariate analysis perform timing vasospasm abnormal AR , compute number day date diagnosis SAH date first detection vasospasm abnormal autoregulation respect variable likely influence occurrence : age , WFNS grade , Fisher 's grade CT scan , treatment procedure , intraventricular haemorrhage and/or hydrocephalus use Cox Proportional Hazards regression . The measure outcome hazard ratio ( HR ) , express probability vasospasm abnormal autoregulation specific category relative placebo group . Variables associate EPO treatment ( haematocrit , erythrocyte count , reticulocyte count , thrombocyte count , serum iron level , viscosity ) collect . The improvement fit due variable test statistical significance 5 % level likelihood ratio test . The test departure linear trend ( one degree freedom ) use assess potential linear trend certain categorical variable . Daily result patient also average produce patient-oriented database satisfy independence assumption linear regression . The day-to-day variation parameter calculate standard deviation divide average value examination patient . Power analysis : Our previous observation indicate vasospasm abnormal THRT occur 64 % 90 % SAH patient respectively . To demonstrate 50 % reduction duration vasospasm abnormal autoregulation power 80 % significance level 5 % require examination 80 patient . This number patient also 83 % chance demonstrate 50 % reduction incidence clinical DID first 2 week follow ictus . The study power show reduction clinical endpoint although trend seek identify potential adverse effect . DETAILS OF ANY DIFFICULTIES THAT CAN BE FORESEEN 1 . Patient recruitment : The Neurosurgical Unit Addenbrookes treat 80 aneurysmal SAH patient per annum . Previous study unit show high ascertainment , large contributor International Hypothermia Aneurysm Surgery Trial ( IHAST ) . We foresee difficulty recruitment . 2 . Safety issue : The safety efficacy use high dose intravenous epoetin beta ( 100,000IU ) treat human acute stroke ( within 8 hour ) confirm [ Ehrenreich 2002 ] . The therapeutic margin EPO wide . Even high serum level adverse effect observe [ NeoRecormon information sheet , Roche ] . 3 . Assessment AR use TCD : Quality control THRT assessment vigorously address , failure complete test rare [ Ratsep 2002 ] . The incidence significant carotid atherosclerotic disease preclude safe carotid compression le 1 % [ Lam 2000 ] . The test well tolerate know patient request withdraw investigation previous study due discomfort etc . FUTURE RESEARCH Results phase II study use design phase III clinical outcome trial use Spontaneous Intracranial Haemorrhage Group mechanism . Any potential benefit may extrapolate cerebrovascular condition low CBF state loss autoregulation occur ( e.g . acute cerebral vasculitis ) .</detailed_description>
