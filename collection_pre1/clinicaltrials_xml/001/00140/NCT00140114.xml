	<brief_summary>Misoprostol ( Cytotec® ) synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog market United States since 1988 gastric cytoprotective agent . In contradistinction prostaglandin E2 preparation ( dinoprostone , Prepidil , Cervidil ) , misoprostol inexpensive available score tablet break insert vaginally . Despite focused campaign manufacturer curtail use obstetric practice , misoprostol , past several year , gain widespread acceptance labor induction cervical ripening agent . Such off-label indication endorse American College Obstetricians Gynecologists medical body . Recently , FDA approve new label use cytotec pregnancy remove pregnancy contraindication use . Vaginal administration seem efficacious give orally , although worry uterine tachysystole hyperstimulation vaginal dos &gt; 50-µg . The use sublingual misoprostol cervical ripen term recently investigate two study compare oral route , assumption sublingual route would higher efficacy vaginal route avoid first pas effect gastrointestinal hepatic system , low hyperstimulation rate avoid direct effect cervix . In addition , sublingual route would combine easy administration add advantage restriction mobility administration . There previous report literature compare use misoprostol give sublingually give vaginally induction labor term . Our aim compare efficacy , safety patient satisfaction misoprostol give vaginally ( current standard ) give sublingually .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sublingual Versus Vaginal Misoprostol Labor Induction Term</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Misoprostol , synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog , give orally vaginally induction labor third trimester.1 Vaginal misoprostol show efficacious oral misoprostol equivalent doses,2 although worry uterine tachysystole hyperstimulation vaginal dose 50 µg higher.2-4 The high efficacy vaginal administration may explain pharmacokinetics drug . Zeiman et al5 show systemic bioavailability vaginally administer misoprostol 3 time higher oral administration . Plasma concentration metabolite , misoprostol acid , peak one two hour vaginal application compare peak see 30 minute follow oral administration , although peak level low vaginal route , sustain longer overall exposure drug increase , perhaps presystemic gastrointestinal hepatic metabolism occur oral route . An additional explanation high efficacy could direct effect cervix initiate physiologic event lead increase uterine contractility.6 However , seem trend toward patient preference oral route . The sublingual route administration report literature prior 2001 . Since partly issue relate patient preference , investigator start study sublingual route administration misoprostol . In theory , sublingual route could mimic vaginal administration pharmacokinetically , although report study route administration . It speculate sublingual misoprostol could combine high efficacy vaginal route avoid gastrointestinal hepatic metabolism , could restrain effect uterine contractility avoid direct effect uterus cervix . Therefore , theory , sublingual route may lower hyperstimulation rate would advantage less invasive administration lack restriction mobility . Although many study publish use sublingual misoprostol medical abortion first second trimester , 7-11 , two study ( group ) compare sublingual oral misoprostol , different doses.12,13 The 50-µg dose choose dose commonly use orally vaginally various study report literature.3,14 To best knowledge , study compare sublingual vaginal misoprostol labor induction term previously publish literature . Therefore , study , complete provide evidence relative effect safety profile different route administration misoprostol labor induction . The aim study compare efficacy 50-µg sublingual dose misoprostol administer 4-hour interval equivalent dose regimen administer vaginally woman admit induction labor medical obstetric indication term . In addition , want assess safety profile patient acceptability 2 mode administration . The study hypothesis sublingual route administration misoprostol effective vaginal route induction labor term acceptable patient compare vaginal misoprostol .</detailed_description>
