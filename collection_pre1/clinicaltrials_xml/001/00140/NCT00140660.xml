	<brief_title>ACVBP Versus ACVBP Plus Rituximab Low Risk Localized Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30 40 % diffuse large B cell lymphomas localize diagnosis ( stage I-II ) . Until seventy , radiotherapy use single modality treat localize stage half patient cure . From eighty , anthracycline-based regimen combine radiotherapy give superior result term relapse free survival compare radiotherapy alone . Later Miller et al . publish randomized study show 3 cycle CHOP combine radiotherapy give superior result term overall survival compare 8 cycle CHOP . This study recently update follow 8 year show difference two arm , due excess late mortality combine treatment . Recently , two trial conduct GELA compare chemotherapy alone combine chemo-radiotherapy approach patient low risk localize diffuse large cell lymphoma ( age-adjusted IPI = 0 ) . - The objective LNH 93-1 study compare , patient age 18 60 year 3 cycle CHOP follow radiotherapy chemotherapy alone consist 3 cycle ACVBP . The ACVBP regimen include intensive induction follow sequential consolidation . With median follow 55 month , result show superiority ACVBP arm 5 year event free ( 83 % vs. 74 % , p = 0.004 ) overall survival ( 89 % vs. 80 % , p = 0.02 ) . - The LNH 93-4 study compare patient &gt; 60 year association 4 cycle CHOP + radiotherapy regimen without irradiation . This study fail demonstrate benefit combine chemo-radiotherapy term survival , indicate chemotherapy alone probably less toxic patient older 69 year . Considering two trial , conclude radiotherapy give chemotherapy give benefit elderly patient treat low risk localize diffuse large cell lymphoma , ACVBP regimen superior 3 CHOP + radiotherapy patient &lt; 60 year , consider treatment reference patient . Two GELA trial contribute recently improve treatment diffuse large B cell lymphoma consider elaboration future study : - The objective LNH 98-5 study compare association CHOP + rituximab ( R-CHOP ) CHOP regimen alone elderly patient previously untreated large B-cell lymphoma . The analysis show significant superiority association CHOP + rituximab . - The LNH 93-5 study compare ACVBP regimen CHOP patient age 61 69 year aggressive lymphoma least one adverse prognostic factor accord International Prognostic Index . Out 703 patient include study , result show complete response rate two arm , significantly well 3-year event free survival overall survival ACVBP arm CHOP arm . However , benefit seem great patient &lt; 66 year , due high toxicity ACVBP regimen elderly patient . All above-mentioned result lead u propose randomize trial compare ACVBP ACVBP + rituximab ( R-ACVBP ) previously untreated patient low risk localize diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( age-adjusted IPI = 0 ) , extend upper age limit 60 65 year .</detailed_description>
