	<brief_title>A Study Anti-CTLA4 Antibody People With Advanced Synovial Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 750-900 people United States year develop synovial sarcoma , rare form cancer connective tissue . This tumor frequently metastasize part body lung . Chemotherapy sometimes decrease size recurrent tumor , result usually temporary , tumor grow . We try exploit protein make synovial sarcoma ( cancer-germ cell cancer-testis antigen ) target immune system . Specifically , investigate immune-based therapy anti-CTLA4 antibody every 4 week three treatment activate immune system enough attack recurrent synovial sarcoma . In study tumor serve `` vaccine '' source protein , try activate tumor-fighting T cell anti-CTLA4 . Anti-CTLA4 take brake immune system allow otherwise hide immune responses become active . In , could side effect , immune system attack normal organ body . We follow anti-tumor immune response frequent blood test follow treat side effect people develop study determine anti-CTLA4 worth pursue large number patient synovial sarcoma sarcoma .</detailed_description>
