	<brief_summary>Hypotheses : 1 . The prevalence endocrinopathies , growth hormone ( GH ) deficiency particular , among young child diagnose optic nerve hypoplasia ( ONH ) high commonly think . 2 . Early treatment child ONH GH-deficiency prevent adverse outcome . Aims : 1 . Determine prevalence type endocrinopathies child diagnose ONH . 2 . Correlate endocrine outcome radiographic , ocular , developmental finding child ONH . 3 . Examine effect GH treatment growth obesity child ONH , GH-deficiency , either subnormal normal growth compare child ONH GH-deficient . 4 . Compare growth outcomes child isolate GH-deficiency multiple hormone deficiency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects study recruit active newly enrol subject large ONH study . The study duration three year anticipate 38 subject enroll . Subjects recruit study present either growth deceleration least one subnormal result IGF-1 IGFBP-3 . Baseline information collect include : height , weight , head circumference , examination endocrinologist ophthalmologist , endocrine laboratory testing , fundus photography , electrophysiology testing , head MRI , developmental assessment . A glucagon stimulation test perform subject deem GH-deficient delayed growth assign GH treatment , line standard clinical practice . Those normal growth determine GH-deficient glucagon stimulation test randomize treatment GH v control ( intervention ; observation ) . Subjects assign randomized treatment GH provide GH duration participation study . Enrolled subject return every four month monitor progress . Subjects undergo physical examination visit , include height , weight , head circumference , body fat . In addition , subject assign randomized growth hormone laboratory test thyroid , IGF-1 IGFBP-3 hormone , fast lipid level .</detailed_description>
