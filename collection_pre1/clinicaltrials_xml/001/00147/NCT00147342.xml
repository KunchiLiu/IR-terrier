	<brief_summary>Most child type 1 diabetes drop blood sugar exercise . This drop blood sugar result hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) . In child use insulin pump , opportunity reduce basal insulin rate exercise . This study conduct determine decreasing insulin receive exercise reduce risk hypoglycemia . We hope learn body respond hypoglycemia hyperglycemia ( high blood sugar ) occur . As part study , child visit two different day . During visit , child exercise treadmill 60 minute . During one visit , child 's basal rate continue exercise . During one visit , basal insulin stop . The blood sugar check frequently exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Insulin During Exercise Development Low Blood Sugar Individuals With Type I Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each child two study visit . The visit 1 4 week apart . The child come research unit hospital 11:30 a.m. lunch clinic . - If child severe hypoglycemia episode 2 week visit ill time either visit , visit reschedule . The parent child ask want use meter test child 's hemoglobin A1c home . If want , give meter ask test child 's A1c two time day one visit . The two test do time also ask check child 's blood sugar time . The test involve fingerstick similar test blood sugar level home glucose meter . At start visit , continuous glucose sensor insert skin . This do either stomach area , side , buttock depend area look like work best child . A special cream may use numb skin sensor place . At end visit , child option remove sensor wear home continue use . During visit , blood sample draw frequently measure glucose hormone . To make blood sample easy , small tube , call catheter , place vein child 's arm . A special cream may use numb skin tube place . The tube stay vein child hospital . There may itch , sting pain tube vein . However , pain blood drawn tube . If tube stop work , new one need insert . - Blood sugar measurement also make home glucose meter . Instead fingersticks , blood may take tube measure blood glucose home glucose meter . - Blood sample take sent lab , , exercise . - In , 24 blood sample take ( 12 sample visit ) . During visit , child ask walk treadmill . - Before walk treadmill , child check urine blood ketone . - During visit , late afternoon , child walk treadmill 15 minute follow 5-minute rest period . This cycle 15 minute exercise follow 5-minute rest period repeat 3 time total 75 minute . - During one visit , child 's basal insulin rate stop start exercise session restart 45 minute child stop exercise . During visit , basal rate continue . A process like flip coin use decide order visit . - For visit , blood sugar need 120 200 start exercise . Between lunch 4 p.m. , blood sugar check time . To lower blood sugar range , child may give insulin catheter use draw blood sample . No bolus insulin dos give child 's pump lunch . If study doctor nurse think child 's blood sugar may low start exercise , snack may give get blood sugar range . If blood sugar high low correct quickly enough , exercise day may postpone . If happens , child need return another day . - About 30 minute exercise end , child 's blood sugar check . If less 250 mg/dL , snack give last blood draw study make 15 minute later . If blood sugar 250 mg/dL high , snack give child 's blood sugar check 15 minute . At time child 's insulin pump start stop , correction dose insulin may give . - If anytime exercise session child 's blood sugar 325 mg/dL high , child 's insulin pump start correction dose insulin may give . During visit , child 's blood sugar check frequently . If blood sugar drop 65 mg/dL low , hypoglycemia treat carbohydrate . The child treat blood sugar high 65 mg/dL . Dinner give child 6:00 p.m. A bedtime snack give child take home . The snack base child would normally eat day exercise . The child instruct exercise rest day . The child give home glucose meter ask check blood sugar prior bedtime snack , midnight , 3 a.m. , breakfast next morning . The child ask treat blood sugar 80 mg/dL low record information log provide . If parent child decide A1c meter study home , one visit study staff check A1c use meter DCA2000 . A fingerstick blood sample also send central laboratory . The child 's blood sugar also check time test . The catheter blood draw remove visit end 6:30 p.m .</detailed_description>
