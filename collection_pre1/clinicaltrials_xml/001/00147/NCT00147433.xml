	<brief_summary>This study design test hypothesis level thyroid hormone thyroxine ( specifically , free thyroxine , FT4 ) circulate blood pregnant woman key thyroid-related factor influence early fetal brain development . The investigator recruit 5000 pregnant woman clinically normal thyroid function ( normal thyroid stimulate hormone level ) second trimester . After baby bear , investigator measure FT4 second trimester maternal blood sample identify 100 case ( low FT4 level ) 100 match control ( normal FT4 level ) . The child case control undergo neurodevelopmental test 2 year age determine whether IQ differs accord maternal FT4 level pregnancy . The potential impact study effect find , might possible avoid adverse developmental consequence child design test strategy identify treat high risk woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Summary : The purpose propose study test hypothesis key thyroid-related factor early fetal brain development T4 derive maternal circulation . According hypothesis , low circulate maternal level free T4 may adversely influence fetal brain development , even mother clinically euthyroid ( i.e . normal TSH level ) . Specific Aims : The propose project aim determine whether free T4 level 3rd centile euthyroid woman early pregnancy associate reduced neuropsychological development offspring . We recruit cohort 5,000 pregnant woman whose serum sample submit routine prenatal screen Down syndrome neural tube defect early second trimester pregnancy . After woman provide consent , thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) measurement perform . The woman define euthyroid TSH measurement comprise study group . Free T4 measurement perform stored serum delivery . Then , nest case-control study design use . Inclusion criterion include : liveborn , singleton infant deliver Maine 36 week later , weigh least 2,500 gram , report congenital anomaly . Multiple gestation exclude . Eligible woman free T4 measurement 3rd percentile ( case ) match woman/infant pair normal free T4 measurement ( control ) . Overall , 100 offspring category undergo neurodevelopmental test age 2 year , use test battery focus language development attainment milestone motor development . The study 80 % power detect 6 point difference full scale IQ . Study Timeline : Phase 1 . Preparation Recruitment ( month 1-4 ) : Validate reference range TSH Free T4 Assays ; Implement clinical reporting management system TSH measurement ; design implement Data Management System ; develop Provider patient material ; visit office introduce project ; develop informed consent . Phase 2 . Active Recruitment ( month 4-24 ) : Recruit 5,000 pregnant woman , classify euthyroid base second trimester TSH measurement ; measure free T4 measure store serum aliquot pregnancy deliver . Phase 3 . Identification Study Subjects ( month 18-36 ) : Identify 100 case ( euthyroid woman fulfil inclusion criterion free T4 measurement 3rd centile ) 100 match control ( normal free T4 ) among 5,000 euthyroid recruit . Phase 4 . Locate/Recruit Cases Controls ( month 20-38 ) : Locate re-recruit women/infant pair identify phase 3 ; obtain newborn hypothyroidism screen result . Phase 5 . Neurodevelopmental Testing ( month 36-58 ) : Perform neurodevelopmental test measure thyroid analytes ( total T4 , T3 thyroid antibody ) case control . Phase 6 . Data Analysis ( month 59-60 ) : Compare demographic data , along pregnancy- delivery-related information , case control mother/child pair verify match compare non-matched variable two group . Include covariates differ significantly case control ( might relate neurodevelopment ) refine model determine whether unadjusted finding robust . Significance : The knowledge gain study expand understand role thyroid hormone play normal pregnancy . If hypothesis study proposal prove correct , define broad group pregnancy fetal brain development might suboptimal . The primary benefit documenting problem would opportunity develop strategy identify treat high risk woman avoid adverse consequence child .</detailed_description>
