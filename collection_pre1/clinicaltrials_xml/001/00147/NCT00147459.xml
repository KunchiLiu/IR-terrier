	<brief_summary>Aim/Background : This study aim investigate necessity efficacy hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) vaccine booster child liver transplantation . A universal mass vaccination program HBV launch 20 year Taiwan . The coverage rate high effect great . The carrier rate population vaccine coverage decrease 10-15 % &lt; 1 % . In Taiwan , child receive organ transplantation vaccinate HBV vaccine infancy well transplantation procedure . This vaccination background information Taiwanese child quite unique similar country world . The antibody generate vaccine usually wan certain period even normal subject , let alone subject receive organ transplantation immunosuppressive agent transplantation . At present , Taiwan still HBV hyperendemic area risk exposure HBV overlook . Should child give booster dose HBV vaccine transplantation ? And immunogenicity booster dose immunocompromised host ? If child obtain adequate antibody titer , risk HBV infection increase ? This study design answer question . As pediatric hepatologist , author 's routine work take care child underwent liver transplantation . To take advantage , investigator decide study efficacy necessity HBV booster vaccine patient . However , result study able apply kind solid organ transplant patient . Method : The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBs ) titer check patient receive liver transplantation &gt; 1 year ago . If titer &lt; 10 IU/L , booster dose administer . The humoral ( anti-HBs ) cellular immunity ( ELISPOT assay T B cell specific proliferation ) cytokine assay do patient booster dose . A three-year follow-up perform monitor HBV infection patient . Expected Results : The investigator expect survive one year liver transplantation yield relatively good response HBV booster adequate immunosuppression .</brief_summary>
