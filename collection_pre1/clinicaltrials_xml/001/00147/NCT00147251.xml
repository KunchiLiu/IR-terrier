	<brief_summary>Compared standard treatment goal achieve low target LDL cholesterol ( bad cholesterol ) blood pressure people diabetes slow progression atherosclerosis measure carotid artery thickness , reduce clinical cardiovascular event heart attack stroke . This study randomize 3-year trial . The primary endpoint combination various measure carotid artery , ( easy , non-invasive way detect cardiovascular disease ) event heart attack stroke . The study also look secondary endpoint well heart pump , fat , protein inflammatory marker blood , kidney function . The study enrol 549 American Indian men woman diabetes , &gt; 40 year age conduct four field center involve Indian Health Service/Tribal primary care facility Phoenix/Sacaton , Arizona ; Chinle , Arizona ; Rapid City/Pine Ridge , South Dakota ; Lawton , Oklahoma , input American Indian physician community member .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stop Atherosclerosis Native Diabetics Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes incidence increase rapidly United States . Diabetes increase risk CVD , major cause death diabetic individual . The conventional cardiovascular risk factor hyperlipidemia hypertension add progression diabetic vascular disease . Appropriate treatment target LDL-C blood pressure diabetic individual currently debate . The Stop Atherosclerosis Native Diabetics Study randomize , open label , 3-year , clinical trial examine effect aggressive LDL-C ( goal &lt; 70 mg/dL ) BP ( goal &lt; 115/75 mm Hg ) reduction versus standard goal &lt; 100 mg/dL LDL-C &lt; 130/85 mmHg BP . Five hundred forty-nine American Indian men woman &gt; age 40 type 2 diabetes randomize one two group . Lipids BP manage use FDA-approved medication algorithmic approach . The presence progression atherosclerosis evaluate carotid ultrasonography ; echocardiography assess cardiac function . The primary endpoint composite outcome change carotid artery intimal medial thickness fatal/nonfatal cardiovascular event . These outcome combine use ranked analysis carotid thickness assign “ bad rank ” cardiovascular event . Secondary endpoint include carotid plaque score , leave ventricular geometry function , serum CRP , safety measure . Unique aspects study design analysis plan involve change trial LDL-C treatment goal participant baseline incident CVD conventional group , change standard care , use composite outcome . Study result valuable understanding effect aggressive risk factor reduction atherosclerosis burden cardiac function diabetic individual U.S. population provide evidence determine optimal LDL-C BP treatment goal diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
