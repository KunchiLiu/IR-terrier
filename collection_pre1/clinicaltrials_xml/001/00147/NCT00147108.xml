	<brief_summary>The primary objective pivotal study evaluate safety efficacy FUS treatment breast fibroadenoma . Our hypothesis FUS lesion ablation fibroadenoma follow result : a. lead decrease lesion cross-sectional area &gt; 50 % palpation , &gt; 65 % lesion volume measure MRI ( calculation assume elliptical shape lesion 3 dimension ) . b. decrease size , along soften treated volume result satisfactory clinical result great 50 % patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many patient diagnose breast fibroadenoma . These generally detect breast self-exams , annual physicals smooth , rubbery , oval/elliptical lump breast . These patient go receive mammogram , sonogram usually core biopsy differential diagnosis benign disease ( fibroadenoma ) v breast cancer . Although fibroadenomas benign , great concern patient ability mask presence lump breast , painful , cause physical deformity breast symptom . The current treatment surgical excision . Surgical removal invasive may cosmetically undesirable patient . It would advantageous develop non-invasive ablative method treatment disease . Measures clinical success patient elect surgical removal fibroadenoma generally subjective , evaluate primarily patient ( lack palpable lesion , pain free , acceptable cosmetic result ) . A non-randomized study propose allow practical approach subject recruitment . Analysis safety efficacy perform use MRI evaluation physical exam .</detailed_description>
