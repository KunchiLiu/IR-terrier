	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate mechanism whereby leukocyte recruit lung chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) cause tissue destruction . The hypothesis COPD leukocytes enter lung cell responsible degradation lung tissue . We , researcher Imperial College London , isolate leukocyte blood patient COPD , healthy smoker normal subject measure movement leukocytes chemoattractants . We examine , cell surface receptor responsible traffic cell . Furthermore , differentiation cell vitro compare cell healthy smoker normal subject . Specifically , expression enzyme responsible tissue destruction cell surface receptor cell investigate . The objective identify mechanism whereby leukocyte COPD patient behave differently cell healthy smoker normal subject view identify novel target drug therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chemotaxis experiment perform order ascertain migratory characteristic leukocytes towards specific chemoattractants . Comparisons cell different subject compare . In addition , effect various pharmaceutical intervention mechanism also address compare within subject group . In experiment , cell differentiate vitro cellular expression regulation inflammatory mediator chemoattractants examine . Again comparison make subject group efficacy various pharmacological agent cell</detailed_description>
