	<brief_title>A Cluster Controlled Trial Comparing Three Methods Disseminating Practice Guidelines Children With Croup</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Aim : The overall aim study identify - societal perspective - cost associate benefit three strategy implement practice guideline address management croup . Intervention Strategies : The intervention strategy compare mail printed educational material ( `` Standard intervention '' ) , mail plus combination interactive educational meeting , educational outreach visit , reminder ( `` Saturn intervention '' ) , combination mailing , interactive session , outreach visit , reminder plus identification local opinion leader establishment local consensus process ( `` Cadillac intervention '' ) . Primary Objective : To determine three intervention strategy effective lower rate hospital day per 1,000 disease episode . The null hypothesis none intervention strategy reduce hospital utilization rate baseline . The alternate hypothesis intervention strategy grade degree effect hospitalization rate , 'Standard intervention ' minimal effect , 'Saturn intervention ' moderate significant effect , 'Cadillac intervention ' great effect . Secondary Objective : To determine three dissemination strategy effective increase use therapy know benefit . Economic Analysis : To determine three intervention strategy effectively reduce total societal cost include health care cost , cost bear family , cost stem strategy disseminate guideline . Other Objectives : To determine dissemination strategy effectively maintain improve clinical outcome maintain reduce family psychosocial burden . Clinical outcome assess include uncommon severe event endotracheal intubation , respiratory arrest , death , well average duration clinical symptom . The assessment family psychosocial burden include number hour sleep miss child , stress experience primary caregiver ( commonly mother ) . Study Plan : The study objectives achieve follow : 1 . We complete baseline survey ) document Alberta-wide utilization rate health care service ; b ) document severe adverse outcome Alberta-wide ; c ) rank order Alberta hospital base rate hospitalization ; ) document therapeutic practice 24 select Alberta hospital ; e ) document , use prospectively administer survey , psychosocial burden disease family 24 Alberta hospital . 2 . We develop clinical guideline address indication drug therapy hospital admission/discharge criterion . Development guideline include follow : ) convene expert panel ; b ) critically review publish literature ; c ) draft guideline meet standard criterion develop guideline ; ) obtain approval guideline Canadian Pediatric Society , Canadian Association Emergency Physicians , Alberta Medical Association ; e ) publishing guideline journal CMAJ . 3 . We identify 24 Alberta hospital randomize one three dissemination strategy outline . 4 . We complete follow-up survey ) document Alberta-wide severe adverse outcome utilization rate ; b ) document practice pattern 24 Alberta hospital survey baseline ; c ) document psychosocial burden disease family hospital . 5 . We complete statistical analysis compare three randomized group hospital term change health care utilization , change physician use effective therapy , change psychosocial burden disease family . 6 . We complete economic analysis compare change benefit derive three type dissemination strategy relative cost ( change health care cost , relative cost associate three type dissemination strategy , change cost bear family lose wage ) .</detailed_description>
