	<brief_summary>The use Hylan G-F 20 treatment osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee become popular recent year . Typical treatment OA knee include NSAIDs physical therapy protocol strengthen local muscle group decrease pain . When conservative treatment modality exhaust , next step arthroplasty knee . Hylan G-F 20 treatment provide physician intermediate mode treatment prior surgery . Hylan G-F 20 cross-linked , high molecular weight derivative hyaluronan find within synovial capsule knee . This form viscosupplementation intend reduce pain suffer OA increase fluid level within synovial space , provide cushion bony surface within knee joint . Current study look self-reported pain relief Outcomes Inventories . This study aim determine ability Hylan G-F 20 treatment improve parameter gait individual suffer OA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Hylan GF-20 Joint Reaction Forces Kinematic Patterns During Gait Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Typically , adult suffers OA knee , present two choice : conservative treatment consist NSAID therapy physical therapy surgical intervention replace affected knee joint . There third avenue treatment become available recent year . This treatment modality viscosupplementation . Viscosupplementation consist replace hyaluronic acid synovial fluid contain knee joint . It observe synovial fluid OA sufferer less hyaluronic acid ( HA ) , HA remain low molecular size concentration Replacement HA contain synovial fluid use Hylan G-F 20 show clinical study clinically safe , ability provide pain relief minimum adverse reaction . Clinical study concern use Hylan G-F 20 focus safety efficacy regard pain relief suffer OA . To date , study perform look efficacy Hylan G-F 20 kinematics kinetics gait . This study provide data ability Hylan G-F 20 treatment improve temporal-spatial parameter gait suffer OA , well ability Hylan G-F 20 reduce joint reaction force affect knee .</detailed_description>
