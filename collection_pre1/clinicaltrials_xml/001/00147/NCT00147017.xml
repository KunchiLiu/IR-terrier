	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate mechanism whereby specific white cell call macrophage find lung release inflammatory mediator chemical together enzymes destroy surround lung tissue . The hypothesis diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , lung macrophage release either different type inflammatory mediator and/or destructive enzyme compare subject without COPD . We isolate macrophage small piece lung parenchyma . These sample derive lobes resect carcinoma lung . We would aim examine response tissue derive macrophage three group subject , namely ( ) non-smoking control ( lung carcinoma secondary metastasis ) , ( ii ) smoker without clinical histological sign COPD ( iii ) smoker COPD . The resected lung tissue cut small piece wash order release macrophages tissue . The macrophage isolate cell type washing . We use isolated cell vitro examine cell surface receptor order compare macrophage cell macrophage report bronchoalveolar lavage monocyte derive macrophage model . We examine inflammatory mediator synthesis release follow stimulation cell . We also examine regulation release enzymes know damage lung tissue . Using two model examine signal transduction pathway lead activation macrophage investigate effect novel therapeutic agent inhibit inflammatory mediator and/or enzyme synthesis release . The objective identify mechanism whereby macrophage respond pro-inflammatory condition see COPD view identify novel target drug therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) fifth lead cause death UK common cause death increase . COPD currently 6th global impact disease predict 3rd lead cause death 2020 . In UK 2000-2001 estimate cost COPD relate illness estimate ~Â£980 million pharmacotherapy account 48 % expenditure . At present pharmacotherapy COPD purely symptomatic drug currently available halt relentless progression disease . Therefore , need improve therapy treatment COPD . Cigarette smoke major risk factor development COPD , yet reason unknown ~15 % smoker develop disease , suggest underlying genetic component . COPD encompass chronic bronchitis , small airway disease emphysema associate increased inflammatory cell lung include neutrophil , macrophage CD8+ T-lymphocytes . This inflammatory infiltrate think responsible pathophysiological feature COPD precise mechanism underlie inflammatory response unknown.In particular macrophage think mediate pathophysiological feature disease . To end , macrophage isolate lung parenchyma use discontinuous percoll gradient . The cell culture overnight prior assessment inflammatory mediator release . Cells stimulate variety agent include exclusively LPS , IL-1beta TNF-alpha . The release inflammatory mediator cell culture medium measure use ELISA technique . Enzyme activity also measure cell culture medium . Cell surface expression specific marker assess use immunocytochemistry FACS analysis . Function macrophage assess measure phagocytotic activity FACS analysis fluorimetry . Specific signal transduction pathway assess use specific pathway inhibitor gene expression measure real-time PCR . The effect novel therapeutic agent test output aim identify novel therapy COPD .</detailed_description>
