	<detailed_description>The liver adult healthy body maintain balance cell gain cell loss . Though normally proliferatively quiescent , hepatocyte loss cause partial hepatectomy , uncomplicated virus infection inflammation , invoke rapid regenerative response restore liver mass . This restoration moderate cell loss 'wear tear ' renewal largely achieve hepatocyte self-replication . More severe liver injury activate potential stem cell compartment locate within intrahepatic biliary tree , give rise cord bipotential , so-called , oval cell within lobule differentiate hepatocytes biliary epithelial cell . A third population stem cell hepatic potential reside bone marrow ; haematopoietic stem cell contribute albeit low renewal rate hepatocytes , make significant contribution regeneration even completely restore normal function murine model hereditary tyrosinaemia . A recent abstract suggest astonishingly high number bone marrow cell ( ~25 % liver parenchyma occupy bone marrow-derived cell ) engraft differentiate hepatocytes model cirrhosis mouse inject intravenously . More importantly , bone marrow infusion result significant improvement liver function ( serum albumin ) within cirrhotic animal . This safety toxicity study five patient chronic liver disease . Each receive autologous stem cell 10 sixth cell via hepatic artery portal vein image guide scan . Patients follow total 60 day .</detailed_description>
