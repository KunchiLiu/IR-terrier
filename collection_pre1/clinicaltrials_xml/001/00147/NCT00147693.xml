	<brief_title>Systematic Care Informal Caregivers Dementia Patients : An Efficient Approach ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major challenge future health care care dementia patient informal caregiver . In usual care , problem caregiver often remain invisible crisis occur . This inhibition partly result informal caregiver pay scant attention problem . Another reason professional may know support informal caregiver pro-actively ( Van Hout et al. , 2000 ) . Therefore family support programme ( Bengtson , 1985 : Vernooij et al. , 2000 ) transform Systematic Care Programme ( SCP-Dementia ) . The reason choose study efficiency programme potential diagnose treat problem systematically , cover wide range individual problem , flexibility connect intervention problem , suitability pro-activity positive effect programme find previous study ( Vernooij et al. , 2000 ) . To study efficiency cluster randomise controlled trial design use . Randomisation take place three participate region . Professionals ambulatory mental health care service ( psychologist social psychiatric nurse ) randomly assign either intervention group control group recruitment patient informal caregiver . The study population consist pairs patient informal caregiver visit ambulatory mental health care service first time . The intervention train SCP-Dementia subsequent use . SCP-Dementia consist assessment caregiver 's sense competence suggestion deal deficiency competence . The follow-up period one year . The primary outcome patients´ admission nurse home residential home . The secondary outcome quality life . Caregivers´ quality life assess sense competence ( SCQ ) , depression ( CES-D ) physical quality life ( EuroQol ) . Patients´ quality life behavioral problem assess NPI-Q QOL-AD-Scale . The difference propose effect base previous research 14 % patient intervention group 28 % control group institutionalize ( Vernooij-Dassen , 1993 ; 1995 ) . To detect 50 % reduction institutionalization rate 80 % power two side significance level 0.05 , 132 patient-caregiver dyad would need intervention control arm . We inflate sample size design effect 1.15 152 dyad per trial arm allow correlation dyad within cluster ( i.e . professional ) , assume average cluster size four intracluster correlation coefficient 0.05 . Assuming 25 % dropout rate patient-caregiver dyad , study need final enrolment 190 dyad trial arm . The economic evaluation cost-effectiveness analysis regard societal perspective . In economic evaluation cost effect monetarized consequently result net benefit .</detailed_description>
