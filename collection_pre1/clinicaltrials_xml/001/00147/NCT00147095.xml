	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate mechanism whereby lung function decrease COPD . The hypothesis diseases COPD , inflammatory cell include neutrophil , macrophage lymphocytes migrate lung release either different type inflammatory mediator and/or destructive enzyme compare subject without COPD . We aim investigate separate cell type blood subject COPD identify gene highly express compare cell obtain patient without COPD . We also investigate lung macrophage subject identify whether different gene express cell . We isolate different leukocyte population blood extract ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) sample . The type quantity RNA sample reflection specific gene express cell . This RNA send Gene Logic company test sample identify gene express . Similar experiment perform use macrophage obtain follow bronchoalveolar lavage subject . We would aim examine response leukocytes three group subject , namely ( ) non-smoking control ( ii ) smoker without clinical histological sign COPD ( iii ) smoker COPD . The isolated leukocytes either immediately solubilized solution purify RNA use isolate cell vitro follow stimulation investigate whether different gene express differential rate disease state . The objective identify gene specifically express patient COPD view identify novel target drug therapy . We examine leukocyte derive peripheral blood macrophage obtain bronchoalveolar lavage aim determine whether difference attributable disease identify circulate cell site disease . This preliminary study determine profile inflammatory mediator expression leukocytes power calculation determine number subject appropriate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involve comparison inflammatory response leukocytes derive 3 separate subject group . The aim study compare response leukocytes patient COPD subject smoke healthy non-smokers . One part study involve isolation different leukocyte population blood subject group . In second part study , examine expression inflammatory mediator leukocytes derived bronchoalveolar lavage sample patient COPD , smoker without COPD healthy non-smokers . In subject willing participate , compare blood derive leukocytes cell derive undergoing BAL , although every subject provide blood BAL sample . The isolated leukocyte ( blood BAL ) use vitro experiment determine difference gene expression inflammatory cell patient COPD . Details intervention subject 1 . Medical History Physical Examination A full medical history physical examination ( include height weight ) perform initial screen visit , addition record clinical case note . 2 . Respiratory Assessments Forced Expiratory Volume per second ( FEVI ) measure use dry wedge spirometer ( Vitalograph , Buckingham , UK ) express percent predict value . Subjects train use apparatus begin study . The baseline value visit measure least fifteen minute quiet rest , take high three reading make one-minute interval . Single read take time . 3 . Endoscopic Bronchoscopy An operator approve Royal Brompton Ethics Committee perform bronchoscopies . The bronchoscopist perform procedure Dr Borja Cosio . Subjects attend bronchoscopy suite 8.30 fast midnight . Subjects pre-treatment atropine ( 0.6 mg iv ) midazolam ( 5-10 mg iv ) . Oxygen ( 3 l/min ) administer via nasal prong throughout procedure oxygen saturation monitor digital oximeter . Using local anaesthesia lidocaine ( 4 % ) upper airway larynx , fibreoptic bronchoscope ( Olympus BF10 Key-Med ) pass nasal passage trachea . Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) perform right middle lobe use warm 0.9 % NaCl 4 successive aliquot 60 ml . This well-tolerated subject COPD . Patients may experience pharyngeal irritation follow procedure ; 5 % chance fever follow procedure . Subjects undergo bronchoscopy clinical reason also include study . 4 . Venous Blood Sampling 60 ml blood take venopuncture .</detailed_description>
