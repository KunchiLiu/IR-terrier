	<brief_title>Does Access EHR Patient Portal Influence Chronic Disease Outcomes ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim study determine e-portal intervention influence : - Measures patient activation , patient self-management , treatment adherence , patient satisfaction care , disease specific knowledge . - Process measure relevant appropriate care CVD , CHF , DM . - Clinical marker cardiovascular diabetes morbidity risk . These aim evaluate one-year prospective study . Patients use portal randomize control ( i.e. , access routine portal-related information ) intervention group ( i.e. , target periodic message design capture data relevant self-management ; improve knowledge specific disease , test , risk ; devise time-dependent goal ; motivate self-efficacy ) . Outcomes include activation , satisfaction , adherence measure telephone interview prior one year intervention , lab clinical measure data available EHR . We also evaluate potential selection issue among sign e-portal administer baseline interview match ( disease age ) random sample patient sign e-portal . Patients chronic disease likely experience particular benefit online e-health resource great information need participate self-management . ( Camer , 2000 ) Unlike traditional office visit , online interaction eliminate need travel , always available give patient access broad range information , help actively participate care . ( Brown , 1999 ) There grow evidence patient education engagement use e-health application result improve patient outcome care chronic illness , improve patient-physician communication , reduction anxiety caregiver . ( Brennan et al. , 2001 ; Bronson et al. , 1986 ; Bronson &amp; O'Meara , 1986 ; Ross et al. , 2003a , 2003b ) We anticipate demonstrate clinically meaningful improvement chronic disease health status , use evidence-based science deliver behaviorally-validated way .</detailed_description>
