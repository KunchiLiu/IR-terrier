	<brief_summary>This study open , non-randomised , clinical phase 2 trial , involve 30 woman diagnose uterine papillary serous cancer . The researcher investigate effect four cycle paclitaxel/carboplatin , follow whole pelvic external beam radiotherapy standard pelvis field ( 50.4 Gy ) without para-aortic boost respect safety efficacy treatment , pattern recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uterine Papillary Serous Cancer ( UPSC ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial Objectives : - To assess safety efficacy combination Paclitaxel Carboplatin +/- pelvic radiotherapy treatment UPSC . - To observe pattern recurrence follow administration combination Paclitaxel Carboplatin +/- pelvic radiotherapy treatment UPSC . - To assess QOL , overall survival disease free survival . Treatment Surgery : Total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , +/- pelvic aortic node sampling , omentectomy , peritoneal cytology . Chemotherapy : Chemotherapy commence surgeon 's medical oncologist 's discretion time surgery start chemotherapy record . One treatment cycle consist 3 week . Paclitaxel Carboplatin administer follow : Day 1 : - Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV po phenergan 12.5 - 25 mg IV - Cimetidine 300 mg ranitidine 50 mg IV - Dexamethasone 20 mg IV - Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 - Carboplatin AUC 6 Day 22 : Repeat cycle . This Day 1 second cycle . Day 43 : Repeat cycle . This Day 1 third cycle . Day 64 : Repeat cycle . This Day 1 fourth cycle . Day 85 : After fourth cycle chemotherapy patient Patients stage 4 disease continue chemotherapy total 6 cycle . Patients surgical stage 1b 3c disease receive whole pelvis external beam radiotherapy ( 50.4 Gy RD 5 half week +/- paraaortic boost +/- vaginal vault brachytherapy boost ) . Radiotherapy start 4 6 week commencement chemotherapy haematological count recover .</detailed_description>
