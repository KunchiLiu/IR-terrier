	<brief_summary>The purpose study correlate nasal volume cross-sectional area nasalance score . We measure nasal volume cross-sectional area acoustic rhinometry . Nasalance score determine Nasometry . Acoustic rhinometry mean study volume cross-sectional area nasal cavity non-invasive , rapid , convenient reliable manner . Acoustic rhinometry unique advantage completely non-invasive , thus able measure nasal patency without confound effect probes invasive monitoring . Nasometry technique measure oral nasal component nasalance . Nasalance objective measure nasal component speech determine ratio sound pressure emit nasal oral cavity speech . Nasality term use characterize nasal component speech , subjective measure . Eleven healthy subject underwent acoustic rhinometry pre post decongestion use oxymetazoline 0.05 % nasal spray . Nasalance score base reading three passage : rainbow , zoo , nasal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Nasal Volume , Cross-Sectional Area With Nasalance Scores Measured Acoustic Rhinometry Nasometry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acoustic rhinometry technique utilizes sound wave measure nasal patency . The reflection wave nasal structure allow one ass volume cross sectional area nasal cavity . It non-invasive procedure perform rapid , convenient , reliable manner . There minimal discomfort patient perform easily office . There distortion nasal anatomy function result procedure . Nasometry technique measure oral nasal component nasalance . Nasalance objective measure nasal component speech determine ratio acoustic pressure emit nasal oral cavity . 'Nasality ' term use characterize nasal component speech , subjective measure . The Nasometer ( Kay Elemetrics Corp Lincoln Park , NJ ) computer-based device analyze acoustic energy emit oral nasal cavity speech . It consist two microphone separate plate . The upper microphone measure nasally emit acoustic energy , low microphone measure acoustic energy emit oral cavity . Nasalance important measure speech pathology . In situation velopharyngeal competence question , nasometry objectively document nasal component speech normal , hypemasal hyponasal . It find tremendous benefit management patient cleft palate velopharyngeal incompetence . The subject relaxed , fit headgear apparatus . This apparatus place plate lie horizontal plane rest midway nose mouth . There microphone upper low surface plate capture sound energy produce nasal oral cavity respectively . The subject ask read standard passage . The three commonly use passage describe , use study . The 'Rainbow ' passage representative standard English speech . The 'Zoo ' passage nasal consonant , 'Nasal ' passage high number nasal consonant . While subject reading , microphone capture sound pressure level emit nasal oral cavity . This data analyze attach computer present graphically . The computer also provide nasalance score three above- mention passage . Normative data available passage adult child . By compare data obtain subject normative mean standard deviation , investigator categorize subject 's voice normal , hyponasal hypernasal . The nasalance score generate also use monitor efficacy speech therapy surgical intervention .</detailed_description>
