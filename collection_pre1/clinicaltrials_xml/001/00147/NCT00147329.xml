	<brief_summary>Merrimack conduct research study see experimental drug , call MM-093 , safe effective treatment psoriasis . MM-093 genetically engineer version naturally occur protein call alpha fetoprotein ( AFP ) . Adults normally small amount AFP bloodstream . However , pregnancy , AFP level mother fetus much high normal . It observe woman psoriasis autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis few symptoms pregnancy , particularly third trimester . At time , level AFP blood mother fetus high . This observation lead Merrimack begin examine MM-093 potential treatment psoriasis . This study design test safety effectiveness MM-093 patient psoriasis .</brief_summary>
