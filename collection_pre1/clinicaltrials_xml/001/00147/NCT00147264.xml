	<brief_title>Telmisartan-Induced Reduction Intra-Myocellular Lipids Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome currently affect 20 % adult population Canada . Patients abdominal obesity markedly increase risk diabetes heart disease . Recent study show decreased sensitivity insulin ( insulin resistance ) , hallmark metabolic syndrome , relate increased storage fat muscle cell ( muscle fat ) . Several recent study indicate block renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) may improve insulin sensitivity prevent development type 2 diabetes . Other data suggests effect may due effect RAS blockade recruitment growth adipose tissue . The primary aim study therefore explore role angiotensin II development insulin resistance . Specifically , examine mechanism underlie putative anti-diabetic effect RAS blockade examine effect angiotensin receptor blockade muscle fat content individual abdominal obesity . This study therefore test hypothesis treatment angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan ( MicardisÂ® ) reduce muscle fat , thereby improve insulin sensitivity people abdominal obesity , without additional feature metabolic syndrome . A number dietary factor also affect insulin sensitivity may influence muscle fat . Recent study suggest increase content low-glycemic food ( carbohydrate less easily digest ) , improve insulin sensitivity lipid profile patient insulin resistance . A second aim study therefore test hypothesis low-glycemic diet reduce muscle fat , thereby improve insulin sensitivity population .</detailed_description>
