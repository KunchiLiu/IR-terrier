	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether long term treatment oral erythromycin effective treatment subject Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) reduce number exacerbation degree airway inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Long Term Macrolide Antibiotic Therapy Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD characterise persist airway inflammation lead progressive irreversible deterioration lung function eventual development respiratory symptom may become disable . Periodic episodes worsen symptom exacerbation major cause additional morbidity , mortality health care utilization . Currently available therapy limit efficacy reduce airway inflammation prevent exacerbation . Macrolides erythromycin show potent anti-inflammatory effect vitro experiment lung condition cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis well open label study COPD . We hypothesise long term therapy oral erythromycin would reduce airway inflammation reduce frequency exacerbation patient COPD . If property demonstrate therapy potentially important benefit effective condition .</detailed_description>
