	<brief_summary>The aim study examine inflammatory mechanism involve pathogenesis inflammatory lung disease , particular compare inflammatory profile see asthma COPD . Evidence inflammation asthma COPD base finding increased number macrophage neutrophils lung respiratory secretion patient . The inflammatory cell produce protease , well , reactive oxidant specie result protease/anti-protease imbalance favour lung destruction . The aim examine inflammatory mediator release inflammatory cell ( , macrophages lymphocyte ) order determine whether difference non-smoking subject , smoke subject patient asthma COPD . Monocytes precursor alveolar macrophage , monocyte neutrophil recruit lung blood via action specific chemoattractants . We evidence inflammation high level chemoattractants . Therefore cell might also demonstrate change see alveolar macrophage patient . We also aim assess role macrophage precursor ( monocyte ) neutrophils blood . We also assess lymphocyte/monocyte interaction . We lymphocyte may involve initial recruitment inflammatory cell . We also assess role cytokine involve monocyte/macrophage/neutrophil migration induce sputum well role induce sputum migration monocyte neutrophil lung . Our aim link initial change blood change cause disease lung . We aim examine cellular response four group subject , namely ( ) non-smoking control , ( ii ) smoker without clinical evidence COPD asthma , ( iii ) smoker COPD ( iv ) asthmatic patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overall subject characterise one four group : normal non-smoking subject , healthy smoker , patient asthma patient COPD . Subjects fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion , give write consent . Recruitment Methods . Volunteer subject ( healthy non-smokers healthy smoker ) recruit within National Heart Lung Institute . Volunteers recruit via advertising use ethically approve advertisement . Asthmatic COPD patient recruit outpatient clinic The Royal Brompton Hospital . At screen visit , diagnosis asthma COPD confirm clinical case note . If patient volunteer , undergo full history examination , spirometry . Each subject attend one study visit . At first visit number investigation undertaken include , spirometry reversibility ( 400 microg ventolin via meter dose inhaler initial spirometry show obstructive picture exclude asthmatic ) , sputum induction . In addition , 50ml venous blood take . More specifically , follow intervention undertaken subject 1 . Medical History Physical Examination A full medical history physical examination ( include height weight ) perform initial screen visit , addition record clinical case note . 2 . Respiratory Assessments Forced Expiratory Volume per second ( FEVI ) measure use dry wedge spirometer ( Vitalograph , Buckingham , UK ) express percent predict value . Subjects train use apparatus begin study . The baseline value visit measure least fifteen minute quiet rest , take high three reading make one minute interval . 400 microg ventolin administer via meter dose inhaler give initial spirometry show obstructive picture ( FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict , FEV1 /FVC &lt; 70 % ) order distinguish presence asthma COPD . 3 . Sputum Induction Sputum induction perform Asthma Laboratory . The subject inhale 3.5 % saline room temperature , nebulised via De Vilbiss 99 Ultrasonic nebuliser set , maximum output use mouthpiece . After five minute subject rinse his/her mouth thoroughly water , ask cough deeply expectorate sputum pot . Samples first five minute collection discard . This procedure continue ten minute , result sample collect polypropylene pot . It important explain subject aim obtain sputum , saliva dispose spit bowl later discard . In case chest discomfort shortness breath , procedure stop spirometry repeat . If FEV1 fall 10 % predict value , subject rest FEV1 return baseline value procedure terminate . Sputum sample analyse differential absolute cell count ( eosinophil , neutrophil , macrophage , lymphocyte , columnar epithelial cell ) . Sputum supernatant assay TNF-alpha , IL-8 , interferon-gamma , cytokine level . Immunohistochemistry perform induced sputum sample identify cellular localisation factor involve leukocyte function . Cytospin preparation make differential cell count soluble fraction use cytokine assay . 4 . Venous Blood Sampling Fifty ( 50 ) millilitre blood shall venesect study visit . We investigate factor involve leukocyte function chemotaxis . We also assess cellular distribution receptor think important regulation use FACS analysis .</detailed_description>
