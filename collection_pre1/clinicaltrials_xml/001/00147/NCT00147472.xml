	<brief_summary>The purpose trial determine ability positron emission tomography ( PET ) detect residual cancer neck lymph node patient follow curative treatment radiation therapy squamous cell cancer arise head neck . Patients head neck cancer ( HNC ) undergo treatment curative intent ; patient node positive ( N2 N3 stage ) undergo standard management include post-radiation plan neck dissection two third patient end evidence residual disease neck dissection specimen ; patient could avoid surgery . However , currently use standard test , like compute tomography ( CT ) and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) reliably predict post-radiation disease free .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PET-Fluorodeoxyglucose scan image test base increase uptake radiolabelled glucose tumour cell . PET might detect neck tumour well image test . This cohort study patient N2 N3 squamous cell carcinoma head neck undergo PET CT scan baseline post-radiation therapy chemotherapy . Then , undergo neck dissection surgery . The PET CT result compare presence absence tumour neck node . If PET sufficiently accurate predict presence absence tumour neck node , neck dissection could avoid .</detailed_description>
