	<brief_title>Interagency Registry Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support ( Intermacs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Over last several decade , MCSDs develop augment supplant fail myocardial performance . This therapy use successfully bridge heart transplantation , bridge recovery , permanent implantation `` destination therapy '' intractable heart failure . Although heart transplantation offer life-saving therapy select patient , use limit supply donor organ currently meet less one-tenth need . As consequence , number MCSD implantation increase recent year . Despite favorable survival quality life outcome , MCSDs severe sometimes life-threatening complication , include infection , thrombosis , device failure . The development new procedure device reduce complication expedite work registry involve systematic , independent analysis MCSD implantation procedure outcomes . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) collaborate Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) monitoring work registry permit development standard reporting patient characteristic , indication , implantation procedure , adverse event . Intermacs Design Narrative : The goal registry include follow : 1 . Develop standard method collect data use characterize heart failure patient receive MCSDs , develop method collect demographic data device use patient outcomes 2 . Collect , process , store patient ' clinical data 3 . Analyze collect data 4 . Provide resource researcher outside registry 5 . Publish disseminate result Intermacs include pediatric patient since inception registry 2006 increase effort September 2012 include pediatric subject . This focus call Pedimacs . Pedimacs utilizes Intermacs protocol . Due collection pediatric-only data element , separate Users ' Guide develop Pedimacs . Intermacs serve national quality improvement system assess characteristic , treatment outcomes patient receive legally utilized mechanical circulatory support device . The protocol undergone several change since inception 2006 . The Current protocol ( Protocol 5.0 ) reflect late change necessity waiver inform consent authorization participant . In January 2013 Medical Arm Interagency Registry Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support ( Medamacs ) establish capture data patient advanced heart failure receive mechanical circulatory support device . The aims Medamacs : 1 . Identify prospectively population ambulatory patient optimal medical therapy chronic heart failure limit function survival range elective implantation leave ventricular assist device offer meaningful benefit . 2 . Design integrate endpoint survival objective functional assessment provide discrimination chronic ambulatory heart failure current device outcome survival alone . 3 . Evaluate patient perception cardiac condition , ventricular assist device technology , preference care , threshold consider device implant . Enrollment Medamacs close . The clinicaltrials.gov identification number Medamacs NCT01932294 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Legally utilized MCSD implant March 1 , 2006 ; every consent patient receives eligible MCSD participate center enrol , regardless reason ( i.e. , bridgetorecovery , bridgetoalternative bridge , bridgetoclinical improvement transplant eligibility , bridgetotransplant , destination therapy ) . Beginning June 1 , 2014 , lnstitutional Review Board approval , participate site may enroll patient waiver informed consent authorization . Eligible device include follow : 1 ) approve device indication ; 2 ) Intermacslinked trial investigational device approve device investigational indication , data enter via Intermacs framework ; 3 ) external trial investigational device approve device investigational indication , data collect external group ; 4 ) compassionate use investigational device approve device outside approved indication clinical trial Currently incarcerate</criteria>
