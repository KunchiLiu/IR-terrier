	<brief_title>Balloon Catheters Stents Prevent Heart Rhythm Irregularities Individuals Post-Heart Attack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There unequivocal evidence early coronary reperfusion use either thrombolytic primary angioplasty result long-term mortality reduction among individual heart attack . The benefit early reperfusion ( le 6 hour heart attack ) initially attribute myocardial salvage resultant preservation leave ventricular function . However , know survival benefit associate thrombolytic therapy consistently associate major improvement leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) . These observation lead formulation `` late open artery hypothesis , '' suggest clinical outcome potentially improve late reperfusion heart attack . Observational clinical study suggest late patency infarct-related artery ( IRA ) thrombolysis associate survival benefit independent LVEF therefore solely explained salvage myocardium . Definitive proof late open artery hypothesis currently lack , however , previous study evaluate late percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) occlude IRAs heart attack produce conflict result . These finding lead organization Occluded Artery Trial ( OAT ) , international , NHLBI-funded , randomized trial 2,200 participant . OAT test hypothesis mechanical reperfusion occlude IRA PTCA percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) 3 28 day heart attack high-risk individual reduce mortality , recurrent heart attack , hospitalization class IV congestive heart failure . Enhancement electrical stability one major mechanism propose explain association open IRA improve prognosis independent myocardial salvage . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study ancillary study OAT . It characterize effect late PCI occlude IRAs important clinically relevant noninvasive marker vulnerability malignant ventricular arrhythmia : heart rate variability , T wave variability , signal-averaged electrocardiography . These analysis perform 300 participant baseline , 30 day , 1 year follow heart attack order determine effect late PCI autonomic nervous system , ventricular repolarization , ventricular conduction abnormality .</detailed_description>
