	<brief_summary>Brief Summary Detailed Description Background : A multitude risk factor fall report elderly , however many risk factor applicable person spinal cord injury , use wheelchair mobility . The objective study : ( 1 ) describe incidence prevalence tip , fall , fall-related injury SCI ; ( 2 ) describe epidemiology fall event ( person , time , place , activity ) ; ( 3 ) describe injury associate fall , include mechanism nature injury , severity injury , well treatment require ; ( 4 ) determine risk factor related fall fall-related injury SCI , develop model predict fall fall-related injury SCI ; ( 5 ) determine healthcare utilization well direct indirect cost associate fall-related injury SCI ; ( 6 ) describe patient-perceived short- long-term consequence fall SCI . The data collection study complete March 31 , 2007 , data analysis final phase . Objectives : The objective study describe : ( 1 ) incidence prevalence wheelchair tip , fall , fall-related injury ; ( 2 ) epidemiology event ; ( 3 ) injury associate event , include mechanism , nature , severity injury treatment require ; ( 4 ) determine risk factor develop model predict tip fall ; ( 5 ) determine healthcare utilization direct indirect cost ; ( 6 ) describe perceive short- long-term consequence fall SCI . Methods : This prospective cohort study . Data collect patient survey , medical record , VA databases . Baseline information include risk factor ( e.g. , user characteristic , wheelchair feature , wheelchair activity , etc . ) physical environmental data . Monthly follow-up call track tip , fall , injury . Status : Recruitment end April 1 , 2006 total 702 subject , data collection complete March 31 , 2007 . The Data Safety Monitoring Board study conduct final meeting September 17 , 2007 . Data analyze 17 manuscript currently development . Impact : While much know fall elderly , lack understanding epidemiology wheelchair-related fall . Our project expect identify previously unaccounted factor predispose person SCI fall fall-related injury . This study result creation model predict fall fall-related injury SCI . The predictive model use develop intervention strategy target modifiable risk factor . Eventually , test predictive model vulnerable veteran population . Findings study wil use develop instrument identify fall risk person SCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Of 702 patient enrol , 659 subject provide data follow analysis . The primarily male ( 96 % ) population 55 + 13 year old , SCI average 21 + 13 year . 47 % injury level cervical 46 % thoracic . The majority subject use manual wheelchair ( 62 % ) average 10.9 + 4.3 hour day . 553 fall event report 204 individual . 95 ( 14 % ) subject injured result fall . Regression model show fall occurrence predict increase pain past two month , increase alcohol use , high FIM sub-motor score , previous fall , short wheelchair length , few year SCI , one 's first wheelchair . Injurious fall predict increase pain past two month , high FIM sub-motor score , previous fall , non-flat home entrance diagnosis arthritis . In model , 83 % variance explain predictor . Additional analysis plan completion manuscript . In addition , fund receive develop risk assessment tool fall wheelchairs SCI . Final analysis conduct 17 manuscript currently development .</detailed_description>
