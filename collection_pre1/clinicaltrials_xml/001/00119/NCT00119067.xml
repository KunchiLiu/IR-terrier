	<brief_summary>Anthrax Clinical Trial Objectives : To assess whether : - Anthrax vaccine ( AVA BioThrax , BioPort Corp. Lansing MI ) administer intramuscular ( IM ) route elicit antibody response inferior ( i.e. , `` non-inferior '' ) achieve currently license schedule . - BioThrax administer IM route contain few number dose elicits antibody responses inferior ( i.e. , `` non-inferior '' ) achieve currently license schedule . - Differences reactogenicity exist IM subcutaneous ( SQ ) administration BioThrax . Additionally final report ass whether : - Occurrence adverse event follow AVA administration influence select risk factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study 43-month prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled comparison immunogenicity reactogenicity elicit BioThrax give different route administration ( SQ versus IM ) dose regimen ( many 8 dos versus 4 dos ) . Sterile saline use placebo dos drop regimen use AVA , all-placebo study group . This study conduct among total 1564 healthy adult men woman ( 18 61 year age ) five site United States . Participants randomize one 6 study group 260 participant per group . One group receive BioThrax give currently license ( SQ 6 dos follow annual booster ) ; another group give placebo IM ( 130 participant ) SQ ( 130 participant ) currently license dose regimen . The four group receive BioThrax IM modify dose regimen ; placebo give dose BioThrax omit licensed dose regimen . There total 25 require visit study , participant receive injection vaccine placebo ( 8 injection total ) , blood sample drawn ( 16 17 total ) , in-clinic examination adverse event ( 22 total ) . Immunogenicity assess assay 16 serial blood sample obtain participant 17th sample subset participant vaccination specify time . Total anti-protective antigen IgG antibody ( anti-PA IgG ) quantify use standardize validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ; primary study endpoint 4-fold rise antibody titer antibody concentration relative pre-vaccination titer assay reactivity threshold . A subset serum sample also assay vitro toxin neutralization assay ( TNA ) measure functional activity anti-BioThrax antibody . The kinetics immune response BioThrax examine 3 time point study blood sample subset participant test correlate protection immunogenetics substudies . All adverse event ( AEs ) , include vaccine reactogenicity , actively monitor . While AEs ascertain among study participant , several endpoint define base likelihood occurrence and/or clinical importance . Of primary interest occurrence local AEs warmth , tenderness , itching , pain , arm motion limitation , erythema , induration , nodule , bruise . Systemic AEs fever , fatigue , muscle ache , headache , temperature , painful axillary adenopathy also evaluate . This study expect provide basis consideration change route BioThrax administration SQ IM reduction number vaccine dos require primary booster immunization . There interim analysis data collect participant 's first 7 month study consideration change route BioThrax administration SQ IM , elimination 2 week vaccine prim dose . At end study , Sponsor present entire result trial FDA consideration elimination additional dos license BioThrax schedule . At time , Sponsor also supplement data result parallel non-human primate challenge study additional research immunologic correlate protection .</detailed_description>
