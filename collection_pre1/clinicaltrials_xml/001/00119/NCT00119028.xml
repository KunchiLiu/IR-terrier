	<detailed_description>Background : Based publish evidence , collaborative care depression necessary sufficient improve care outcome depress patient primary care setting . The Translating Initiatives Depression Effective Solutions ( TIDES ) project , upon ReTIDES base , develop VA-adapted version collaborative care input veteran , clinician , manager . The initial TIDES project result clinically stable effective model test seven primary care practice three VISNs . This positive result provide basis spread sustain TIDES model initiate study national implementation strategy issue . Objectives : The objective grant carry preparatory step toward national implementation , include develop investigate TIDES sustainability partner marketing strategy . The project support VISNs learn organization area depression care improvement , ultimately aim support many 8 % 10 % veteran nationally improve health quality life . Preparatory step include 1 ) development easily disseminate tool , include CPRS decision support , panel monitoring , care manager team training material , 2 ) national local dissemination support TIDES model sustainability spread 3 ) evaluation use tool would assess success project , could use quality monitor roll-out . Methods : Tools : We use Chronic Illness Care model Evidence Based Quality Improvement method develop tool disseminate TIDES additional medical center practice 3 TIDES VISNs two medical center ( 10 practice ) one additional VISN . These tool use national implementation . Dissemination : We serve technical expert consultant 1 ) carry national regional training ; 2 ) link national patient care service , employee education , information technology method priority ; 3 ) support evidence-based quality improvement new sites.We organize effort national dissemination plan . Evaluation : We develop applied 1 ) formative evaluation tool ; 2 ) fine-tuned performance measure tool base electronic data , apply non-randomized quasi-experimental design ( untreated control group pretest posttest ) ; 3 ) web-based survey primary care clinicians 4 ) innovative implementation cost assessment approach . We also use 5 ) qualitative information process dissemination , include link national resource 6 ) randomize design evaluate long term ( 18-month ) cost effectiveness TIDES . Status : Completed .</detailed_description>
