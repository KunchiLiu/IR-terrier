	<detailed_description>This phase II/III , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study safety efficacy chemoprophylactic tenofovir , administer orally daily IDUs . The study conduct Bangkok 17 BMA Drug Treatment Clinics . Study participant randomize ( 1:1 ) receive tenofovir 300 mg placebo . Participants evaluate adverse event HIV seroconversion . Primary endpoint : The primary efficacy endpoint measure rate HIV seroconversion measure monthly interval . The primary safety endpoint measure frequency Grade 3 4 renal hepatic function laboratory toxicity clinical toxicity blind tenofovir placebo arm , define Gilead-modified NIAID Adult Common Toxicity Tables , directly attribute cause study medication ; frequency adverse clinical event tenofovir placebo arm . Secondary endpoint : Changes HIV associate risk behavior measure rate report injection drug use injection drug use frequency trial ; rate report needle sharing ; number unprotected sexual act course trial ; number report sexual partner course trial ; proportional use condom sexual intercourse . Medication adherence measure : rate , interview documentation tenofovir adherence card , participant take least six ( 86 % ) seven daily dos study drug four week precede monthly study visit . Differences virologic immunologic response HIV infection among tenofovir placebo recipient measure : plasma viral load , measure quantitative RNA PCR , predictor clinical progression HIV disease ; 14 CD4 cell count measure flow cytometry . Rates nature HIV antiretroviral genotypic phenotypic resistance measure . Genetic characteristic infect HIV virus include DNA sequence analysis antibody bind study conduct . In phase II , participant follow month 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 3 monthly hematology chemistry test laboratory evaluation renal hepatic function 200 person-years observation accrue . At point , DSMB safety assessment conduct . Follow-up enrol participant continue DSMB safety assessment . If safety confirm , phase II participant continue , additional participant enrol phase III portion trial . Accrual target enrollment 2,400 IDUs anticipate take 48 month . Participants choose two follow-up schedule : monthly ( every 4 week ) monthly plus daily directly observe therapy ( DOT ) . During DOT visit clinic staff witness participant swallow his/her study medication clinic staff initial participant 's tenofovir adherence card . Monthly visit group include assessment tenofovir adherence adverse event , pill count collection unused pill , provision new 1 month supply study medication , pre- post-test HIV counseling , rapid oral HIV testing , urine pregnancy test ( female participant ) , HIV risk reduction counseling , medication adherence counseling . At 3 , 6 , every 3 month thereafter monthly procedure supplement risk behavior questionnaire .</detailed_description>
