	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis chronic relapse disease acute flare . The standard therapy treat acute flare use topical medication . The two common class topical medication atopic dermatitis ( AD ) topical corticosteroid topical calcineurin inhibitor . Pimecrolimus topical corticosteroid exert activity different mechanism , may synergistic effect combination therapy . Therefore , combination therapy may provide fast resolution severe skin lesion consequently reduce duration topical corticosteroid treatment . Another benefit combination therapy maybe use low potency corticosteroid achieve degree clearance . The hypothesis trial combination two agent lead fast clearance single agent topical corticosteroid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial double-blind control trial fluticasone cream daily pimecrolimus cream BID versus fluticasone cream daily placebo cream BID treatment acute flare atopic dermatitis . While pimecrolimus cream 1 % proven effective mild moderate Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) , need fast control severe skin lesion . On hand , reduce duration topical corticosteroid treatment reasonable approach minimize occurrence adverse effect . Because pimecrolimus topical corticosteroid exert activity different mechanism , may synergistic effect combination therapy . Therefore , combination therapy may provide fast resolution severe skin lesion consequently reduce duration topical corticosteroid treatment . Another benefit combination therapy maybe use low potency corticosteroid achieve degree clearance . In vitro data demonstrate combination steroid tacrolimus synergistic effect vitro human lymphocyte proliferation . In addition , previously report , pilot investigation two subject , combination regimen pimecrolimus 1 % twice day fluticasone propionate cream 0.05 % daily superior fluticasone propionate cream 0.05 % daily acute treatment atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . This study conduct validate finding large number patient .</detailed_description>
