	<brief_summary>Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) class anti-HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) drug important part HIV treatment regimen . Because anti-HIV therapy may negative side effect , great need carefully study HIV infected patient regimen . One negative side effect observe many HIV infect patient lipoatrophy , condition result fat loss body . It unclear NRTIs also role development mitochondrial toxicity , condition affect body 's ability produce energy . The purpose study observe effect NRTI-based , protease inhibitor ( PI ) -sparing drug regimen fat loss HIV infect , treatment-naive adult . Study hypothesis : The initiation NRTI-containing , PI-sparing therapy inhibit mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) synthesis lead decrease mtDNA content adipose tissue , skeletal muscle peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) , cause deterioration mitochondrial function , increase fat apoptosis oxidative damage biomarkers , lead progressive decrease body fat content .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study Fat Loss HIV Infected Adults Taking Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NRTIs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NRTIs mainstay HIV treatment regimen , often part initial treatment regimens newly diagnose patient . Recent data suggest NRTIs responsible lipoatrophy , condition mark progressive fat loss . Another negative side effect antiretroviral ( ARV ) regimens mitochondrial toxicity , damage heart , nerve , muscle , kidney , pancreas liver , well affect body 's ability produce energy important life process . It hypothesize lipoatrophy may relate mitochondrial toxicity , causal relationship two yet establish . This study examine HIV infected treatment-naive patient initiate first ARV regimen . The regimen contain 2 NRTI , one zidovudine non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) . The regimen contain PIs . Patients participate study 96 week . There 4 study visit Weeks 12 , 24 , 48 , 96 . Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan fat biopsy occur visit . Additionally , blood collection metabolic test occur Week 12 . ARVs provide study .</detailed_description>
