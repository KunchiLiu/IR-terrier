	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Obesity smoking major risk factor variety health-related disorder , heart disease , stroke , certain form cancer , diabetes . Recently , report 65 percent adult United States overweight obese . The increase epidemic obesity lead many initiative treat obesity number recent initiative prevent weight gain . Similarly , prevalence smoking decline past year , despite availability several clinically cost-effective smoke cessation program . One unwanted effect smoke cessation weight gain , , turn , may exacerbate weight-related health issue . Behavioral program , less degree pharmacological program , design reduce post-cessation weight gain successful . However , give weight gain typically cosmetic , determined program target high medical risk result weight gain ( e.g. , individual hypertension ) . To knowledge , study evaluate smoke cessation program , follow lifestyle modification program , prevent weight gain among placed medical risk post-cessation weight gain , include individual hypertension . Some study find increased prevalence hypertension follow smoke cessation . It believe largely ( solely ) due weight gain follow cessation . However , weight gain individual hypertension place risk . Body weight single best predictor adult blood pressure , blood pressure respond small change overall body weight . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study recruit 660 smoker hypertension elevate blood pressure . Given African Americans high risk post-cessation weight gain hypertension , majority participant recruit African American . Participants randomly assign either follow : ( ) validate smoking cessation program follow validated weight control program ( TONE ) , consist change dietary intake physical activity ; ( b ) smoking cessation program follow general health education ( contact-time control ) program . A follow-up evaluation occur 1 year follow end treatment .</detailed_description>
