	<brief_summary>Reducing prevalence obesity population one Healthy People 2010 goal . Increased vigilance require age group prevent reverse overweight obesity . On individual level , behavioral factor influence body weight include eat choice lead excess calorie intake physical activity pattern lead diminished calorie expenditure . An imbalance two time lead increase weight . On population basis , prevalence overweight associate myriad influence , include social , behavioral , cultural , environmental factor well genetic physiological factor . For majority overweight individual , restore balance energy intake expenditure difficult , therefore increase emphasis prevent obesity population level . The long-term goal research prevent increase rate obesity population . In adult population work age , majority day spend worksite , suggest intervention worksite level may offer opportunity success age group . It anticipate project yield important contribution understand obesity prevention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : More half American adult overweight obese , proportion increase . The health risk associate obesity include diabetes , cardiovascular disease , arthritis , cancer . It well establish individual level , weight gain cause take calorie expend . On population basis , prevalence overweight obesity associate myriad influence , include genetic physiological factor well social , behavioral , cultural , environmental factor . Behavioral factor contribute weight gain include eat choice lead increase energy intake physical activity choice lead decrease energy expenditure . For majority overweight individual , restore balance energy intake expenditure difficult . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study develop test comprehensive intervention involve simple message integrate change dietary intake change energy expenditure , simultaneously modify structural environmental factor promote social support opportunity behavioral change . The study recruit randomize 48 worksites 2-year intervention follow carry : build physical activity intervention combine increased daily physical activity regular , structure exercise ; build dietary intervention promote lower calorie intake ; increase worksite access healthy food physical activity . The primary aim evaluate effectiveness intervention reduce maintain body mass index randomize control trial worksites . The study compare change body mass index intervention versus control worksites use two cross-sectional survey baseline follow-up . Additional assessment use biomarkers fitness measure perform subset employee . The research team considerable experience intervention worksite level substantial expertise obesity prevention .</detailed_description>
