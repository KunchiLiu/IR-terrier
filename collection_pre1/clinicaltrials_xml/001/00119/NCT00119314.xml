	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , docetaxel , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gemcitabine together docetaxel capecitabine work treat patient cancer unknown primary origin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine , Docetaxel , Capecitabine Treating Patients With Cancer Unknown Primary Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine feasibility positron emission tomography ( PET ) pathology assessment identify primary tumor site patient carcinoma unknown primary . - Determine efficacy safety gemcitabine , docetaxel , capecitabine patient carcinoma unknown primary . Secondary - Determine frequency PET scan pathology assessment define organ origin patient . OUTLINE : This 2-part , multicenter study . - Part 1 : Patients undergo comprehensive standard evaluation , include pathologic assessment positron emission tomography scan , attempt identify primary tumor site . If primary tumor site identify , patient proceeds appropriate treatment tumor study . If primary tumor site remain unknown , patient proceeds chemotherapy part 2 study . - Part 2 : Patients receive gemcitabine IV docetaxel IV 30 minute day 4 11 . Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 44 patient ( 10-29 part 2 ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
