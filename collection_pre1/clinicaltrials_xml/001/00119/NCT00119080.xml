	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether new meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( MCV4 ) reduce asymptomatic carriage meningococcal bacteria , thus decrease transmission bacteria population . Neisseria meningitidis lead cause bacterial meningitis United States . A new tetravalent ( A , C , Y , W-135 ) meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( [ MCV4 ] , MenactraTM manufacture Sanofi Pasteur Inc. ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) January 2005 . This vaccine recommend ACIP routine vaccination young adolescent pre-adolescent visit ( 11-12 year old ) , adolescent high school entry ( 15 year old ) , college freshman live dormitory . Prevention asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage meningococci important interrupt person-to-person transmission induce herd immunity , low transmission result low disease rate among people vaccinate . No study yet do evaluate impact new vaccine carriage . This randomized study design evaluate effect MCV4 meningococcal carriage . Several high school randomize intervention control group . Students intervention group receive MCV4 begin study , student control group offer MCV4 study completion . Three specimen throat secretion ( similar swab Strep throat ) collect student enrol study : vaccination intervention group student ( start school year ) , 8 week post-vaccination , 9 month post-vaccination ( end school year ) . Questionnaire administered time swab assess potential risk factor meningococcal carriage . Meningococcal bacteria isolate throat specimen serogrouped molecularly type . Approximately 2,000 student group need study . Anticipating 35 % refusal rate 25 % loss follow-up , approximately 4,200 high school student need approach group . This study answer important question whether vaccinate protected disease , also asymptomatic carrier meningococci . If , vaccinate able carry transmit bacteria unvaccinated individual . Meningococcal conjugate vaccine may become available near future age group , include infant child . Determining efficacy MCV4 meningococcal carriage important policy decision regard vaccination future conjugate vaccine different age group .</detailed_description>
