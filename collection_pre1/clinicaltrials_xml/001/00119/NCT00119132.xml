	<brief_summary>Intermittent preventive treatment malaria child ( IPTc ) promise new approach malaria control . Preliminary study IPTc Senegal Mali indicate approach effective . Although result study suggest IPTc sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) plus artesunate ( AS ) SP alone efficacious safe intervention reduce burden malaria anaemia child high transmission area short transmission period , data area long transmission period . This study aim evaluate effectiveness IPTc reduce anaemia malaria area 6 month transmission Ghana . Two thousand two hundred forty child age 3-59 month randomly allocate four group ( 560 per arm ) receive amodiaquine plus artesunate ( AQ+AS ) , give two different interval ( monthly bimonthly ) , SP placebo . The child also follow determine rebound incidence severe malaria anaemia year follow IPTc .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : In high transmission area , major proportion death severe morbidity malaria occur first year life , intermittent preventive treatment infant ( IPTi ) could make major contribution reduce burden malaria whole . However , many area Africa , mortality morbidity malaria child five year age high burden malaria predominantly infant , IPTi , even highly effective , would limited impact overall burden malaria child . Few community trial evaluate effect IPTc prevention malaria . Dicko colleague Mali , area seasonal malaria transmission give two dos SP child age 6 month 9 year interval two month find protective efficacy 40 % clinical attack malaria among child intervention group compare placebo group . Recent work Niakhar , Senegal assess IPTc area intense short seasonal malaria transmission . The study use combination SP plus one dose AS , give every month three month rainy season last four month . This study show IPTc use AS+SP well tolerate without drug-attributable adverse event IPTc reduce incidence clinical malaria 86 % . Although result suggest IPTc SP+one dose AS efficacious safe intervention reduce burden malaria anaemia child , data effectiveness IPTc area prolong transmission season use form combination therapy IPTc . Study overview : The study aim determine optimum drug schedule IPTc area prolong seasonal malaria transmission Ghana . The main study compare effectiveness IPTC use SP , monthly AQ+AS bimonthly AQ+AS . In order facilitate interpretation result trial , two ancillary study do . The first conventional vivo drug efficacy study SP AQ+AS child clinical malaria ensure efficacy drug use IPTc trial within study area . The second subsidiary study investigation whether administration IPTc one malaria transmission season follow increase incidence malaria anaemia follow malaria transmission season . Study Objectives : 1 . To investigate whether IPTc use monthly bimonthly AQ+AS SP improve mean Hb level decrease anaemia malaria morbidity young child area intense prolong seasonal malaria transmission . 2 . To compare incidence severe malaria among child age 3-59 month use three treatment regimen . Study area : The study carry Hohoe district , Ghana . The major rainy season last April July minor one September November . The rest year relatively dry . Malaria common disease area . For past four year malaria account 32 % patient attendances 45 % child five year . Twenty five percent ( 25 % ) malaria case require inpatient care 37 % case child five year 57 % report anaemia . The peak OPD malaria anaemia case occur June October . Study procedure : A cross-sectional survey carry informed consent obtain guardian child age 3 59 month select village . Information collect background child guardian , hypersensitivity study drug bednet use . Anthropometric index measure . Drugs administer study child every month May October . Field worker coordinator visit participant week May October . Parents guardians strongly advise come directly health centre child develop symptom sign illness field worker ' weekly home-visits . Passive surveillance perform six medical assistant twelve nurse base health centre sub-districts within district . Malaria clinical attack document treatment malaria illness provide free charge study participant health centre catchment area select community . If child fever feature suggestive malaria , finger prick blood sample collect Hb malaria parasite detection . Two slide prepared child . At health centre , one slide examine day decide appropriate treatment . The second slide keep sent central laboratory read provide definitive diagnosis . Those malaria treat oral quinine 10mg/kg every 8 hour 7days follow day 3 7 outcome measurement . At end malaria transmission season , cross-sectional survey undertaken involve child remain study . Following administration short questionnaire , finger prick blood sample obtain preparation blood film determination Hb . A filter paper sample collect molecular study .</detailed_description>
