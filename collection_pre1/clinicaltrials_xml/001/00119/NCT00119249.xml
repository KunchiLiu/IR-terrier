	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy sorafenib , term anti-tumor effect proportion clinical response , patient previously untreated unresectable stage III stage IV melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Correlate efficacy drug presence mutant wild-type BRAF gene tumor patient . II . Determine toxicity profile drug patient . III . Correlate serum cryptic collagen epitope extent tumor burden , invasion , metastasis patient treat drug . IV . Determine potential serum cryptic collagen epitope serve surrogate marker monitoring course disease patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord presence BRAF gene mutation tumor sample ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 26-74 patient ( 13-37 per stratum ) accrue study within 5.2-18.5 month .</detailed_description>
