In addition , low intensity group answer two general health question ; high intensity group respond complete range question focus diabetes hypertension , receive educational tip . The intervention group participate protocol 6 month follow enrollment . Data collect baseline 6 12 month , include measure clinical outcome , quality life , knowledge , adherence , self-efficacy , satisfaction care . In addition measure , data collect estimate cost home telehealth intervention . Most subject male ( 98 % ) Caucasians ( 96 % ) mean age 68 year ( range 40-89 year ) .</detailed_description>
