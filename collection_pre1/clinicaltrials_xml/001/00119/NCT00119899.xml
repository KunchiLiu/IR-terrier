	<detailed_description>Study design : Prospective randomize study . In arm conventional diagnostic test perform . In arm A ( conventional strategy ) FDG-PET scan perform . In arm B ( experimental strategy ) FDG-PET scan make result incorporated decision clinical management refer surgeon . Motivation study design : Randomization one strategy one strategy without FDG-PET scan allow truly estimate impact include FDG-PET scan diagnostic work-up . More specifically study design allow determine : 1 . The impact FDG-PET disease-free survival hepatic resection . 2 . The amount cost diagnostic ( non ) -therapeutic procedure strategy . 3 . The average number month disease-free survival adjust quality health ( Q-TWIST ) two strategy . Scientific basis study proposal : Although add value FDG-PET diagnostic work-up well establish , unclear current study , whether sensitive meticulous preoperative stag impact patient outcome . Moreover , prospective comparative economic evaluation strategy diagnostic work-up without FDG-PET lacking . Patients consider eligible trial fulfill follow criterion : 1 . One four colorectal liver metastases spiral CT , judge potentially resectable experienced liver surgeon institution participate trial . 2 . No evidence extrahepatic disease demonstrate spiral CT scan chest abdomen oral intravenous contrast contiguous reconstruction algorithm . In case previous rectal cancer spiral CT include pelvic area . CT reading perform experienced radiologist institution participate trial . 3 . No sign recurrent second colorectal carcinoma barium enema colonoscopy . 4 . Absence previous malignancy adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix non-melanoma skin cancer ( unless disease-free interval least 10 year ) . 5 . Absence major hepatic insufficiency . 6 . Absence active infection diabetes mellitus 7. WHO performance status 0 , 1 2 . 8 . Age 18-75 year 9 . Written informed consent Description intervention : - Randomization : patient centrally randomize random diagnostic strategy allocation stratify institution . - FDG-PET scan ; Image acquisition : Imaging perform dedicate PET-scanners . Patients fast least 6 hour PET-scanning . Immediately prior procedure , patient hydrate 500 ml water . Blood glucose level measure . Thereafter , FDG ( 370 MBq use full-ring system , 220 MBq use half-ring system ) 20 mg furosemide inject intravenously . Image acquisition start 60-75 minute FDG injection ( emission transmission image area proximal femora base skull ) . The image correct attenuation reconstruct use ordered-subsets expectation maximization ( OSEM ) algorithm . - Image interpretation : The FDG-PET study read site . The final result FDG-PET alone communicate refer surgeon confidence scale ( ) normal benign disease , ( b ) probably malignancy , ( c ) malignant/benign unclear ( ) definitely malignant disease . Further evaluation take place joint read FDG-PET CT chest abdomen , combine reading score confidence scale allow estimation increase confidence co-interpreted procedure . The combination test form basis surgeon ’ decision making . In case concordant evidence extra-hepatic disease patient consider non-resectable . In case discordance CT FDG-PET , refer surgeon ’ discretion request additional diagnostic test , reject option laparotomy attempt surgical resection liver metastasis . - Laparotomy perform within 4 week randomization . At laparotomy careful examination abdominal cavity perform exclude extra-hepatic disease . In case doubt extra-hepatic disease sample take frozen section . When positive , operation terminate . Intra-operative ultrasound perform detect localize metastatic lesion . Lesions within 1 cm consider satellite lesion count one lesion . In case intra-operative examination show 4 lesion complete resection lesion still possible , resection allow within study proposal . Complete resection metastatic lesion always achieve , possible safety margin &gt; 1cm normal parenchyma . The type liver resection ( anatomical , wedge combination ) surgeon ’ discretion . In case complete resection lesion seem possible operation terminate . The use local ablative technique like radiofrequency cryosurgery allow within study . The post-operative course complication record well duration hospital stay . - Follow-up concentrate detection recurrent disease registration sequela financial consequence medical intervention perform protocol . At 3 , 6 9 month surgery , follow follow-up item perform : history , physical examination , plasma CEA-level CT abdomen chest . All CT reading follow-up perform experienced radiologist field . The diagnosis tumor recurrence make one criterion define : 1 . Objective radiological recurrence radiological CT imaging . That appearance one new lesion radiological image least 20 % increase suspect lesion earlier investigation . 2 . Positive cytology histology ( case ambiguous radiological imaging ) . The documented date recurrence date confirmation recurrence use one method diagnosis . An elevated CEA level , solitary finding , consider acceptable evidence colon cancer recurrence . In case elevation serum CEA two successive time point examination must perform search disease recurrence . Primary outcome parameter - Disease-free survival 9 month hepatic resection . Disease free survival define absence recurrent disease conventional diagnostic imaging ( CT liver/abdomen , CT chest ) . Comment : The study proposal assume patient unnecessarily operate conventional arm ( patient would positive PET extrahepatic disease negative CT extrahepatic disease ) show extrahepatic disease conventional CT imaging within 9 month randomization . This assumption confirm preliminary study conduct institute ( Langenhoff 2001a ) . Secondary outcome parameter - The total cost diagnostic procedure potential therapeutic medical intervention ( hepatic resection , laparotomy ) sequence strategy A B , time horizon 9 month randomization . - The cost-effectiveness strategy A B express cost per month disease-free survival patient undergoing hepatic resection.· The number operation result hepatic resection strategy A B . - The diagnostic yield FDG-PET versus CT image evaluate hepatic resectability detect extra-hepatic disease . - Quality life patient group analyze strategy A B . Primary analysis : Based publication [ Fong 1997 , Scheele 1991 ] follow percentage expect disease-free survival 9 month follow-up : group patient underwent conventional CT strategy expect disease-free survival rate 70 % group patient experimental strategy ( CT + FDG-PET ) expect disease-free survival rate 95 % . To detect difference two group 25 % power 80 % alpha 0.05 ( 1-sided ) , 25 patient require group ( Cohen 1977 ) . To anticipate patient eligible laparotomy hepatic resection 43 patient need arm perform mention analysis . Dropouts patient anticipate . Patient accrual part analyse sufficient 2 year patient inclusion . Additional analysis : Furthermore , intention-to treat analysis perform arm proportion resect patient 3 year survival determine ( latter continue follow-up recruit - resect nonresected - patient beyond formal conclusion present proposal ) . To detect difference resection percentage arm 15 % power 87 % ( 60 % CT+PET group vs 75 % CT-only group , a=0.2 , one-sided ) 75 patient need study arm . The number 150 recruited patient ( 2x75 ) , realistic estimate number patient include 3 year period . This mean time point study closure able detect [ A ] difference disease free survival 25 % ( power 80 % , a=0.05 ) patient resect study arm [ B ] difference resection percentage arm 15 % ( power 87 % , a=0.2 ) . After formal closure study 3 year intention treat analysis continue . With number include patient ( 2x75 ) able detect difference 3 year survival 20 % less ( power 80 % , a=0.05 , one-sided ) resect patient group A B . Definite conclusion equal overall survival arm A B study obviously limit . The following data collect : - Demographic characteristic . - Clinical outcome : primary tumor ( localization , resection date , histology , TNM ) , CEA level , number , size localization metastasis , resectability , histology . - Diagnostic outcome : CT ( baseline 3 , 6 9 month surgery ) : number , size localization metastasis , extra-hepatic disease , recurrence ; FDG-PET ( baseline ) : number , localization size metastasis , extra-hepatic disease . - Follow-up : complaint , morbidity , mortality , presence recurrent disease site ( CT ) , CEA , QoL . - Costs : see elsewhere . To measure separate effect two diagnostic strategy relate treatment regime ( primary outcome ) proportion respondent still disease-free hepatic resection ( CT diagnosis ) 9 month treatment estimate apply life-table analysis ( Kaplan-Meier ) . These estimate proportion use cost-effectiveness analysis ( see section : Economic evaluation ) . A similar analysis , however , extend quality health outcome ( utility : measure EQ-5D ) perform 3 distinct clinical state distinguish : 1 ) laparotomy , cure , 2 ) laparotomy + hepatic resection , possible cure , 3 ) laparotomy + hepatic resection , cure . In order perform so-called Q-TWIST analysis EQ-5D measure baseline month follow-up . The result aggregate analysis express number quality-adjusted month survival two treatment strategy . Another contribution approach information depict one single figure two strategy , clearly divide impact three distinct state occurrence time.Quality-adjusted life year ( QALYs ) compute order perform conventional cost-utility analysis two diagnostic strategy . Utilities ( EQ-5D ) base mean value two group patient 10 occasion ( baseline , month 1-9 ) . Contrary above-mentioned Q-TWIST analysis , distinct state recognize , whereas cost incorporate . Economic evaluation : General consideration : The basic assumption study experimental diagnostic strategy base CT + FDG-PET compare conventional diagnostic strategy base CT lead accurate diagnosis operability liver metastasis . Therefore , economic evaluation base principle cost-effectiveness analysis . Using differential approach , patient follow period 9 month . In addition , patient suffer recurrence disease follow period order able evaluate total cost involve care patient . Because specific patient population study , non-medical cost expect different patient group . Therefore , health care perspective basis analysis , indicate health care cost subject study . A problem base cost estimate data gather part clinical trial extent one capturing resource use associate trial per se ( i.e . cost scientific research ) rather cost provide diagnostic therapeutic care [ Drummond 1997 ] . These call protocol driven cost exclude cost analysis . Regarding cost-effectiveness analysis , patient total cost split diagnostic therapeutic cost . Focusing effectiveness measure ‘ proportion accurate diagnosis ’ , diagnostic cost use calculate incremental ratio compare FDG-PET strategy versus conventional strategy . This result estimate additional diagnostic cost per extra accurate diagnosis . Concerning effectiveness measure ‘ proportion patient disease-free survival ’ , total cost recurrence disease end follow relate mean time disease free survival . This result estimate additional medical cost per month disease free survival . In addition , cost-utility analysis ( CUA ) carry incorporate preference participant consider health status start treatment follow-up . Based preference combine life expectancy figure , calculation so-called quality-adjusted life year ( QALYs ) applicable . A general measure express benefit two different treatment strategy calculate compute area curve utility x measurement moment ( baseline assessment month 9 ) curve . These QALYs 9-month period combine cost strategy arrive cost per QALY gain . Economic evaluation/cost analysis : The cost analysis exist two main part . First , patient level , volumes diagnostic therapeutic care measure prospectively use standardized Case Report Forms ( CRF ) . In participate hospital research nurse register CRF number time patient visit patient department , number day hospital ( normal care intensive care distinguish ) , number kind diagnostic procedure ( CT , FDG-PET , ultrasonography , histological examination ) , type number operation ( intra-operative ultrasonography , endoscopy , resection liver metastasis ) , duration specific operation , number duration therapeutic session , amount kind pharmaceutical therapy ( e.g . pain killer ) , day hospital ( normal care intensive care distinguish ) . This part CRF design pilot test first month study . The second part cost analysis consist determine cost price volume parameter use multiply volume register participate patient . The Dutch guideline conduct pharmaco-economic study ( CVZ , 1999 ) guideline cost analysis use [ Oostenbrink 2000 ] . Because health care perspective study approximation real integral cost use cost analysis . As basis cost price calculation participate hospital unique cost price , base standardized calculation method determine . For baseline analysis weigh average ( use number patient include study participate hospital ) use . Mean , median , range standard deviation total medical cost per patient determine two patient group . Skewness distribution examine determine whether parametric non-parametric statistical technique use test possible statistical difference group . Analysis perform basis intention treat . Besides statistical analysis , impact deterministic variable , cost price use different volume parameter , investigate use sensitivity analyse basis range extremes [ Briggs 1994 ] . For definition range extreme use sensitivity analysis , range cost price calculate participate hospital national guideline use . Economic evaluation/patient outcome analysis : Patient outcome analysis primarily base ‘ proportion disease-free patient 9 month follow-up ’ ( cost-effectiveness analysis ) . As secondary analysis cost-utility analysis carry . For purpose EQ-5D instrument use estimate utility patient different measurement moment . In addition , generic ( SF-36 ) disease-specific ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) descriptive health-related quality life questionnaire apply .</detailed_description>
