	<brief_summary>The study 's primary objective determine whether PRSS improve optimal time photocoagulation diabetic patient VA . Secondary objective include assess program : ( 1 ) lead improved compliance retinopathy screen surveillance visit ; ( 2 ) improve patient provider satisfaction VA diabetic eye care ; ( 3 ) reduces eye care visit rate among diabetic receive eye care VA ; ( 4 ) decrease health care resource utilization ; ( 5 ) improve cost-effectiveness eye care patient diabetes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Effectiveness Program Developed Improve Eye Care Veterans With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes common cause blindness much blindness preventable early detection treatment . Although VA HEDIS quality criterion allow individual diabetes biannual examination , current diabetes eye care policy continue emphasize routine , annual eye exam diabetes patient . Strong evidence suggest current �one-size fit all� method waste resource ignore opportunity substantially improve outcome high-risk patient . Recent research show patient refer screening examination ( i.e. , without retinopathy ) require different follow-up refer surveillance examination ( i.e. , retinopathy ) . Using targeted , risk-based criterion schedule eye examination together system level intervention design assure application may lead improve healthcare outcome . Although , efficacy approach demonstrate system organizational research , yet demonstrate diabetes eye care . Therefore , propose conduct evaluate prototype translational research project examine impact Proactive Diabetes Eye Care Program , coordinate target system-level intervention , : 1 ) optimal time photocoagulation ; 2 ) optimal timing eye care visit ; 3 ) patient provider satisfaction ; 4 ) health care resource use ; 5 ) overall cost-effectiveness target eye care program . The primary intervention involve use innovative �Progressive Reminder Scheduling System� intensity reminder base patient�s degree risk develop proliferative diabetic retinopathy macular edema . At intervention site , separate clinic screen ( whose last examination normal ) surveillance ( know retinopathy ) . This two-year prototype translational project quasi-experimental design . Six facility recruit : three receive intervention without system design component . The control intervention site match comparability baseline screen rate similar patient population . The intervention evaluate use historical control ( pre-post analysis ) comparison control sit . Data collect three source . We use VISTA database determine resource use , patient demographic , co-morbidities medication . Trained medical personnel conduct chart review random sample patient undergoing photocoagulation determine whether sub-optimally time ( i.e. , patient already major retinal hemorrhage advance macular edema time procedure ) . A random sample patient survey , baseline 12 month , non-VA eye care service receive attitude satisfaction toward eye care . We also survey health care provider regard diabetic eye care service . If successful , program serve model disseminate diabetes eye care best practice throughout VA system could provide information best approach manage disease patient may benefit risk stratification rather treat accord single standard .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The population project diabetic patient treat three VAMCs select intervention site . Therefore , patient recruitment require participation initial implementation activity assess compliance recommendation eye examination treatment . Although schedule system redesign clinical guideline use inform eye care clinical decisionmaking , final decision receive diabetes eye care interval continue leave best clinical judgment health care professional patient study site . Nothing study preclude patient physician seek eye care frequently less frequently recommend guideline . In one regard , study could think study usual care two different management organizational system without direct patientlevel intervention . For data analysis purpose , two set inclusion criterion ? EPRP visit criterion diabetes identification criterion . To include primary data analysis patient must meet criteria Office Quality &amp; Performances quality monitoring program . This criterion include least one outpatient visit current fiscal year least one outpatient visit fiscal year prior current year ( see http : //vaww.oqp.med.va.gov/oqp_services/performance_measurement/tech_man.asp ) . The previous current qualify visit must one 8 clinic ( Primary Care ( 301 ) , General Medicine ( 323 ) , Cardiology ( 303 ) , Endocrinology/Metabolism ( 305 ) , Diabetes ( 306 ) , Hypertension ( 309 ) , Pulmonary/Chest ( 312 ) , Women 's Health ( 322 ) ) per West Virginia 's Peer Review Organization 's External Peer Review Program ( EPRP ) selection criterion . Eligible patient would exclude life expectancy 6 month less ( e.g. , diagnosis pancreatic cancer hospice ) . For epidemiological comparability , separate cohort construct evaluate eye care begin study period ( preintervention analysis ) end study period ( postintervention analysis ) . We identify diabetic ( analytic purpose ) require meet one follow criterion previous year : 1 ) one prescription fill hypoglycemic medication selfmonitoring blood glucose supply ( determine VISTA record ) , 2 ) diagnosis diabetes ( ICD9 250.x ) record least 2 separate outpatient encounter , 3 ) diagnosis diabetes record one inpatient stay . None patient meet inclusion criterion</criteria>
