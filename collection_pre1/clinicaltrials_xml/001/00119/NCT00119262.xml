	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together combination chemotherapy work treat patient undergone surgery breast cancer spread lymph node . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together one chemotherapy drug ( combination chemotherapy ) , may better way block tumor growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Combination Chemotherapy Patients With Lymph Node Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine incidence clinically apparent cardiac dysfunction patient lymph node positive breast cancer treat bevacizumab dose dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide follow paclitaxel ( ddAC &gt; T ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate change LVEF treatment . II . To evaluate non-cardiac toxicity . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients sequentially assign 1 2 treatment arm . Arm A : Patients receive doxorubicin IV , cyclophosphamide IV 20-30 minute , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SQ ) day 2-11 pegfilgrastim SC day 2 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course . Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Patients also receive G-CSF pegfilgrastim . Treatment paclitaxel , bevacizumab , G-CSF pegfilgrastim repeat every 14 day 4 course . Patients receive bevacizumab alone every 14 day 18 course . Arm B : Patients receive doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , G-CSF pegfilgrastim group I . Patients receive paclitaxel , bevacizumab , G-CSF pegfilgrastim group I . Patients receive bevacizumab alone every 14 day 22 course . Treatment group continue absence disease recurrence unacceptable toxicity . Patients require radiotherapy ( post-lumpectomy ) plan radiotherapy discretion investigator ( post-mastectomy ) undergo radiotherapy begin within 6 week completion chemotherapy . Premenopausal patient estrogen receptor ( ER ) and/or progesterone receptor ( PR ) positive disease receive oral tamoxifen daily 5 year begin time radiotherapy within 6 week completion chemotherapy . Postmenopausal patient ER and/or PR positive disease receive aromatase inhibitor ( e.g. , anastrozole , letrozole , exemestane ) tamoxifen follow aromatase inhibitor daily 10 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year study entry . ACCRUAL : A total 226 patient ( 104 arm A 122 arm B ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
