	<brief_summary>Background : HIV test cost-effective unselected general medical population , yet test rate among at-risk remain low , even among regular primary care . HIV rapid test effective many healthcare setting scant research do within primary care setting , within US Department Veteran 's Affairs Healthcare System . Objectives : We evaluate three method proven effective diseases/settings : Nurse stand order test , streamline counseling , HIV rapid test . Design : Randomized , control trial three intervention model : Model A ( traditional counseling/testing ) ; Model B ( nurse-initiated screening , traditional counseling/testing ) ; Model C ( nurse-initiated screening , streamline counseling/rapid testing ) . Participants : 251 patient primary/urgent care appointment two VA clinic city ( one large urban hospital , one freestanding outpatient clinic high HIV prevalence area ) Measurements : Rates HIV test receipt result ; sexual risk reduction ; HIV knowledge improvement . Results : Testing rate 40.2 % ( Model A ) , 84.5 % ( Model B ) , 89.3 % ( Model C ) ( p= &lt; .01 ) . Test receipt rate 14.6 % ( Model A ) , 31.0 % ( Model B ) , 79.8 % ( Model C ) ( p= &lt; .01 ) . Sexual risk reduction knowledge improvement differ significantly counsel method . Conclusions : Streamlined counsel rapid test significantly increase test receipt rate current practice without change risk behavior post-test knowledge . Increased test receipt result could lead early disease identification , increase treatment reduce morbidity/mortality .

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND/RATIONALE : HIV test cost-effective unselected general medical population , yet test rate among at-risk remain low , even among regular primary care . HIV rapid test effective many healthcare setting scant research do within primary care setting , within US Department Veteran 's Affairs Healthcare System . The cumbersome nature complexity current counseling testing procedure suggest reason rate receipt HIV test result low . Because standard screen test result unavailable day , many person return result . Up 30 % person test HIV-positive 2000 39 % person test HIV-negative return ( 1 ) . The CDC recommend alternate streamline counsel test method may increase receipt rate HIV test . To address problem fail return screen result , incorporated rapid HIV test propose screen trial . OBJECTIVE ( S ) : The specific aim project : To determine whether nurse-based referral traditional HIV test counsel improve screen rate compare current testing procedure . To determine whether nurse-based rapid test streamlined counsel improve screen rate nurse-based referral traditional test counsel alone . To assess cost-effectiveness alternative strategy HIV test counseling . Secondary aim compare patient knowledge HIV test prevention practice view procedure ' acceptability traditional rapid testing/streamlined counsel . To achieve aim , propose robust three-arm randomize controlled trial . METHODS : We plan parallel-group randomized control trial set general medicine urgent care clinic West Los Angeles VA Medical Center ( VAMC ) . All participant underwent interview collect information HIV risk factor predictor HIV screening , well knowledge HIV test characteristic prevention . All patient randomize one three model screen : Model A : Traditional counseling/testing ; Model B : Nurse-based screening + traditional counseling/testing ; Model C : Nurse-based screening + streamline counseling/ rapid test The analysis focus difference three model rate screen , receipt result , knowledge , acceptability cost-effectiveness . FINDINGS/RESULTS : Testing rate 40.2 % ( Model A ) , 84.5 % ( Model B ) , 89.3 % ( Model C ) ( p= &lt; .01 ) . Rates receipt test result 14.6 % ( Model A ) , 31.0 % ( Model B ) , 79.8 % ( Model C ) ( p= &lt; .01 ) . Reduction sexual risk HIV knowledge improvement differ significantly traditional versus streamline counsel . IMPACT : Streamlined counseling rapid test significantly increase test receipt rate current practice without change risk behavior post-test knowledge . Increased test receipt result could lead early disease identification , increase treatment reduce morbidity/mortality . Policymakers consider streamline counseling/rapid test implement routine HIV test primary/urgent care . Widespread implementation would lead critically important health benefit veteran : 1 ) Increased rate test , would lead early identification disease , increase treatment decrease HIV transmission , morbidity mortality ; 2 ) Lower screening cost without decrement either patient knowledge acceptability . The CDC make identification people HIV national priority . The VA opportunity provide national leadership elucidate best identify people live HIV ensure access state-of-the-art care .</detailed_description>
