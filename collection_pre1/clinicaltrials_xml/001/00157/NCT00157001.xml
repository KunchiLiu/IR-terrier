	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate difference 6-month restenosis rate coronary artery lesion treat photopheresis addition angioplasty stent placement , oppose photopheresis angioplasty stent placement . Restenosis mean closing , narrow diameter , previously treat artery , may cause reduce blood flow re-occurrence symptom . Photopheresis therapeutic technique portion white blood cell collect blood separation device expose ultraviolet A light , combination drug 8-MOP ( 8-methoxypsoralen ) , return . The secondary objective : 1 . To compare incidence major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) three treatment group 6 month post-angioplasty . MACE event include death ( cardiac relate ) , myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass graft surgery , repeat angioplasty target vessel , hospitalization clinical symptom . 2 . To evaluate safety treatment compare incidence acute subacute thrombosis , bleed vascular complication non-MACE event every 2 week 6 month post-angioplasty three treatment group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Photopheresis Post Angioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis condition coronary artery characterize abnormal lipid fibrous tissue accumulation vessel wall . This pathologic condition may lead stenosis artery . Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) standard method myocardial revascularization patient occlusive coronary artery disease . Restenosis remain one main factor determine long term success angioplasty . The literature still report 35 % restenosis rate single vessel angioplasty.l,2,3 This study investigate feasibility photopheresis therapy adjunct PTCA plus stent placement mean reduce rate restenosis . The UVAX® XTS™ Photopheresis System currently market use palliative treatment skin manifestation cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) person responsive form treatment . For feasibility study , XTS System treat extracorporeally circulate leukocyte-enriched blood ultraviolet light-A ( UVA ) presence photoactive drug UVADEX® . The UVAR XTS Photopheresis System use separate patient 's blood white blood cell , red blood cell plasma . The red blood cell return patient . A dose two hundred microgram UVADEX add photoactivating bag . A portion plasma white blood cell expose UVA light cause methoxsalen nucleated white blood cell form covalent bond pyrimidine base DNA , prevent replication cell . After exposure UVA light , white blood cell plasma return patient Animal clinical study suggest immune response initiate reinitiation treat white blood cell . The mechanism immune response clear . It appear lethally injured white blood cell reinfused patient , surface antigen abnormal cell cause host immune system recognize clone untreated malignant cell . This may result true biologic response modification induction favorable immune response underlie malignancy.4 The result clinical study CTCL patient treat similar procedure show prolong clinical remission . Photopheresis show affect disease mediate aberrance immune system , e.g. , scleroderma , HIV infection CTCL . These disease involve variety serologic abnormality cellular humoral immune dysfunction . For instance , CTCL demonstrate abnormally elevate CD4 count ; scleroderma reveals decrease peripheral T cell increase T cell tissue ; HIV exhibit fall CD4 percentage . Several disease show antibody self DNA cellular components.5 Atherosclerosis recently show constituent factor underlie immune mechanism.6 There exist close functional relationship macrophage T lymphocytes . In fact , lymphocytes demonstrate within plaque atherosclerotic vessels.7 ' 8 These lymphocyte show activated locally , presumably antigens present context class II MHC . Such activated T cell may , turn , modulate pathogenesis restenosis post angioplasty.6 Cyclosporin A , drug specifically inhibit T cell activation , administer animal model result significant reduction intimal lesion post angioplasty.9 This may reflection inhibition T cell activation result inhibition monocyte/macrophage activation therefore inhibition intimal T cell proliferation . Recent evidence suggest UVA Photochemotherapy may represent novel approach control smooth muscle cell proliferation without produce cytolysis.10,11 Photopheresis postulate specifically regulate activate clone T cell . All prior clinical study relate cardiovascular treatment conduct date show photopheresis UVADEX safe treatment modality without serious side effect . Photopheresis study -- prevention treatment acute rejection heart transplant recipients.12 As result treatment , patient experience reduction number severity rejection episode . Photopheresis therapy also allow reduction daily immunosuppressive therapy . No major side effect observe . In another study , use monthly photopheresis adjunct standard drug therapy follow cardiac transplant find significant decrease coronary artery intimal thickness two year follow-up.13 Photopheresis determine safe , well tolerated increase morbidity immunosuppressed patient . A previous study benefit photopheresis follow PTCA enrol 62 patient ( 29 treat photopheresis oral methoxypsoralen 33 control ) . At 6 month follow-up , patient group treat photopheresis exhibit few clinical sign restenosis . No significant side effect observe .</detailed_description>
