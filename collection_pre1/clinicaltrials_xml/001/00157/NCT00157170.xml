	<brief_title>The Effects Supervised Exercise Program Self Efficacy People Living With HIV/AIDS .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With combination antiretroviral therapy , HIV become chronic , manageable medical condition . Medication adherence critical determinant patient outcome . Quality life ( QOL ) rather survival also become important consideration HIV management strategy . The role non-pharmacological intervention exercise enhance self efficacy ( correlate adherence ) QOL among people HIV require formal investigation . We evaluate impact supervised exercise program ( SEP ) self-efficacy among people HIV 24 week , randomise control trial participation SEP combine aerobic resisted exercise ( intervention ) versus individual walk program monthly group forum ( control ) . QOL cardiovascular fitness also evaluate secondary endpoint . Twenty subject enrolled arm , assessment perform baseline , 2 month 6 month , include Generic Self Efficacy Scale , 1 minute heart rate response post 3 minute step test , validate HIV-specific QOL survey . Self efficacy cardiovascular fitness improve intervention control subject study period ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . QOL also improve ( 8 10 dimension ) intervention group control ( 0 10 dimension ) . These data support use SEP important therapeutic intervention people HIV , significant benefit self efficacy , cardiovascular fitness QOL six month . Importantly , benefit achieve unsupervised exercise period .</detailed_description>
