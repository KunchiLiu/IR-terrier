	<brief_summary>The primary focus study collect information diagnostic testing , blood sample analysis patient data collection patient start hemodialysis determine risk preventative factor bleed clot event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Study - Longitudinal Thrombosis End Stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemodialysis patient high rate heart attack , stroke amputation . These problem cause blood vessel problem call atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) , clot . Clotting also problem access , lifeline hemodialysis . We early result show risk factor clot general population common dialysis patient . Bleeding another significant problem within population . In pilot study measure bleeding/clotting factor blood consent patient start dialysis . We also special test show much calcium build atherosclerotic build happen artery whether artery become stiff . We follow patient four year record health problem might reflect bleeding , clot blood vessel problem . At end study , compare people bleed , clot blood vessel problem , learn measurement predict problem . We go study potential treatment , anti-clotting drug , might prevent delay occurrence problem . This would improve health dialysis patient .</detailed_description>
