	<brief_summary>The condition Charcot foot know 130 year , yet still remain large effort find cause , diagnostic medical treatment condition . Charcot neuroarthropathy progressive disease bone joint characterize often-painless bone joint destruction limbs lose sensory innervation . The incidence acute Charcot among diabetic patient 0,2 % prevalence 7,5 % . In group patient neuropathy prevalence even high –29 % . The diagnosis often make clinical basis , particularly early stage condition . The aim study find method make diagnosis primarily basis paraclinical information . Clinical presentation : The typical patient diabetes 10 year distal symmetrical neuropathy . The common lesion unilateral acute phase , may occur either spontaneously trigger minor trauma . The foot become swell , warm , red oedematous . Some patient pain , condition could misdiagnosed cellulite , acute gout , deep vein thrombosis osteomyelitis . If patient foot ulcer important rule osteomyelitis cellulite . In initial phase difficult make right diagnose Charcot rare condition . This lead delay treatment Charcot foot , , moment , reduction weight bearing . The patient equip air cast , non weight-bearing regime case maintain 12 month . The chronic Charcot characterize establish deformity . The deformity different site foot , common mid foot . Because deformity abnormal weight pressure weight bear site foot . This associated callus formation high risk ulceration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterizing Diagnosis ’ Charcot Foot ( Charcot Osteoarthropathy ) Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Method : The investigation case control study aim test set clinical test see diagnose Charcot foot make paraclinical . The assumption , parameter clinical observation differ Charcot patient patient polyneuropathy . The study consist variety examination . All patient undergo clinical examination physician , include neurological status . The paraclinical examination consist blood sample , x-ray foot ( normal MR-scanning foot ) , skeletal Scintigraphy , DEXA scanning , distal blood pressure , beat beat examination decide autonomous neuropathy . If patient positive skeletal scintigraphy ulceration foot , elevate infection parameter blood sample , leukocyte scintigraphy perform order rule osteomyelitis . The population include study divide 5 group : 1 . Patients diabetes acute Charcot foot . 2 . Patients diabetes chronic Charcot foot . 3 . Patients diabetes amputation first toe . 4 . Patients diabetes polyneuropathy . 5 . Patients diabetes without polyneuropathy . All patient undergo full examination program , exception case mention . Conclusions : There need good diagnostic condition Charcot foot , due severe longtime complication form disablement . In case even amputation foot . If diagnosis make earlier , obviously one start intervention earlier , improve “ survival ” foot . Another advantage agree criterion diagnosis Charcot would help allow comparison different treatment .</detailed_description>
