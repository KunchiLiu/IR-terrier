	<brief_title>MEND-CABG ( MC-1 Eliminate Necrosis Damage Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) effectively relieve angina , result longer survival , good quality life specific subgroup patient obstructive coronary artery disease . Due high incidence coronary artery disease worldwide , well effectiveness surgical procedure , CABG surgery make one top ten frequently perform procedure North America Europe . In United States estimate 700,000 CABG procedure perform per year . Despite benefit CABG surgery , patient undergoing procedure may also suffer serious adverse outcome include operative mortality , myocardial infarction , unstable angina , ventricular failure , life-threatening arrhythmia , renal insufficiency , stroke . Some propose cause cardiovascular morbidity mortality CABG include perioperative ischemia , inadequate myocardial protection reperfusion injury . The impact serious complication significant . Incidence rate death MI follow CABG surgery range 5 % 12 % depend risk status . Results large clinical trial recently demonstrate importance neurologic deficit problematic outcome CABG . These deficit include memory impairment , psychomotor , visuospatial , attention language ability measure neuropsychological test well sensori-motor abnormality associate stroke . MC-1 naturally occur small molecule . Evidence pre-clinical clinical study suggest MC-1 protects heart ischemic damage ischemia-reperfusion injury . This trial ass effect MC-1 compare placebo cardiovascular neurological event follow CABG surgery .</detailed_description>
