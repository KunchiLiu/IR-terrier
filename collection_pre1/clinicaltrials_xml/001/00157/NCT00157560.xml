	<brief_summary>Over last year several novel agent define active treatment relapse epithelial ovarian carcinoma . Many new agent seem mechanisms action different Carboplatin taxol . This trial look evaluate effectiveness toxicity three sequential chemotherapy doublet treatment woman newly diagnose ovarian , primary peritoneal tubal carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Modified Triple Doublet Therapy Women With Newly Diagnosed Mullerian Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate novel regimen ovarian carcinoma aim demonstrate high 50 % laparotomy define response rate . This rate define proportion patient achieve either pathologic complete response microscopic positive second look conclusion therapy . Primary study goal : · To determine efficacy triple doublet regimen carefully define cohort patient define surgical define response rate Secondary study goal : - To evaluate incidence tubulin mutation primary secondary surgical specimen . - To evaluate change IL-6 , IL-8 , VEGF , FGF , primary diagnosis , conclusion therapy . - To describe initial IL-6 , IL-8 , FGF level patient ultimately achieve pathologic remission v gross residual disease . Patients recieve 3 cycle carboplatin gemcitabine follow 3 cycle taxol carboplatin three cycle adriamycin topotecan . All patient clinically complete response undergo second look operation determine pathologically define response . - SLO = Second Look Operation</detailed_description>
