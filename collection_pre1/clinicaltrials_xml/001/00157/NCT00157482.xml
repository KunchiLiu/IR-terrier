Furthermore , preliminary evidence suggest ameliorate dyslipidemia may renoprotective diabetic patient proteinuria . Ezetimibe first selective inhibitor cholesterol absorption demonstrate high efficacy lower cholesterol concentration excellent safety profile .

	<brief_title>Ezetimibe Simvastatin Dyslipidemia Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus contributes substantially global burden disease , estimate 150 million people affected worldwide prevalence expect double 2025 . Myocardial infarction stroke common cause major morbidity people diabetes , whose death attribute cardiovascular cause . Recent finding provide definitive evidence cholesterol-lowering therapy produce substantial reduction risk heart attack , stroke revascularizations diabetic patient even high blood cholesterol concentration . Also preliminary evidence available ameliorate dyslipidemia may renoprotective diabetic patient proteinuria . Ezetimibe first member class highly selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor effectively potently prevent absorption cholesterol inhibit passage biliary dietary cholesterol across wall small intestine , without affect absorption fat-soluble nutrient . Many pre-clinical model demonstrate lipid-lowering anti-atherosclerotic property ezetimibe single agent , show synergistic effect combination HMGCoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) . Phase I/II study patient hypercholesterolemia explore safety efficacy ezetimibe monotherapy co-administration simvastatin . In study , combine therapy safely invariably effective single therapy ameliorate lipid profile . Ezetimibe excellent safety profile standard toxicity study pre-clinical model . Clinical study patient primary hyperlipidemia also indicate monotherapy ezetimibe coadministration statin well tolerate . Whether ezetimibe-simvastatin combined therapy effectively simvastatin monotherapy ameliorate lipid profile albuminuria people diabetes worth investigate . Evidence superior efficacy ezetimibe-simvastatin would provide rationale prospective trial aim explore possibility superior cardioprotective renoprotective effect combine therapy . AIM Primary : - To compare effect ezetimibe-simvastatin combination ( 10-40mg/day ) simvastatin ( 40mg/day ) alone LDL-cholesterol concentration type 2 diabetic patient basal total cholesterol &gt; 135mg/dl and/or concomitant lipid lower therapy HMGCoA reductase inhibitor . Secondary : - To compare effect treatment total cholesterol , apolipoprotein A1 B , lipoprotein ( ) triglyceride concentration . - To evaluate safety profile two treatment . Explorative : To explore hypothesis ameliorate dyslipidemia therapy may also result reduction urinary albumin excretion rate . DESIGN This randomize , prospective , double-blind , parallel group study . Following 4-week wash-out period previous lipid-lowering therapy ( ) HMGCoA reductase inhibitor kinds lipid-lowering drug , patient enter two-month run-in phase simvastatin 40mg per day . At completion run-in period , patient randomly allocate two double-blind treatment arm , ezetimibe 10mg + simvastatin 40mg per day placebo + simvastatin 40mg per day two-month treatment period .</detailed_description>
