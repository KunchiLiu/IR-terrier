	<brief_title>Thrombolysis Using Tenecteplase ( MetalyseÂ® ) Cardiac Arrest - The TROICA Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial prospective , international , multi-centre , randomise ( 1:1 ) , double-blind , parallel group comparison conduct investigate efficacy safety tenecteplase placebo patient cardiac arrest presume cardiac origin . Approximately 1300 patient ( two group 650 patient ; tenecteplase match placebo ) suffering witness ( eye ear ) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest presume cardiac origin , treat ALS-CPR randomise approximately 40 study centre . Randomisation do immediately insertion IV line establish . Study drug application , single IV bolus 5-10 second , do immediately first vasopressor application ALS-CPR procedure . PCI facility require participate site , i.e . hospital receive patient . Study Hypothesis : The primary aim trial demonstrate superiority intent-to-treat analysis tenecteplase placebo regard primary endpoint incidence 30-day survival ( 30daysurv ) . Comparison ( ) : Group A ( experimental ; fibrinolytic treatment ) Tenecteplase , single IV bolus 5-10 second , immediately first vasopressor dosage standardise ALS-CPR procedure accord International CPR Guidelines . Group B ( reference ) Placebo , single IV bolus 5-10 second , immediately first vasopressor dosage standardise ALS-CPR procedure accord International CPR Guidelines .</detailed_description>
