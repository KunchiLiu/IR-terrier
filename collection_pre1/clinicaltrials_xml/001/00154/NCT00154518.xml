	<brief_title>The Role Matrix Metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) Orthodontic Tooth Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long treatment time major factor cause high fee orthodontic treatment . Patients would dental caries periodontitis result improper oral hygiene care long treatment period . How speed tooth movement determine duration orthodontic treatment , help people obtain good occlusion esthetic . Orthodontic force tooth induce bone resorption compression side bone deposition tension side , thus bone remodels tooth move . Therefore , bone resorption rate-limiting step lengthy orthodontic treatment . Bone resorption complex process . The mineral component dissolve acid osteoclast . On hand , organic component digest proteolytic enzyme secrete osteoblast osteoclast . We focus study specific protease digest extracellular matrix , call matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . Osteoblast-derived MMPs play important role initiation bone resorption . However , mechanism regulation clear . The past study apply stretch tension single layer culture cell characterize cellular response mechanical stimulation . Now simulate part bone resorption process cultivate osteocyte-like cell three-dimensional collagen gel periodical compression . In preliminary study , focus transcriptional change MMPs upon compression osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 . Initial data form microarray indicate specific increase two MMPs expression one day compression . This increased expression specific level house-keeping gene ( ex . Beta-actin GAPDH ) bone-specific marker unaltered . Therefore , propose increase MMP expression osteoblast compression first step bone remodel switch synthesis degradation osteoid . In order test hypothesis , follow specific aim achieve : 1 . To test whether two MMPs up-regulated orthodontic treatment . Alveolar bone sample collect partially impacted third molar orthodontic uprighting different period time volunteer . In situ hybridization immunohistochemistry analysis MMPs reveal role physiological process . 2 . To optimize regulation change magnitude frequency pressure , characterize time table change .</detailed_description>
