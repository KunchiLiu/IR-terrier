	<brief_summary>One emerge concept form injury inflammation prerequisite success circulating-cell participation differentiate tissue structure function . Once reperfusion achieve acute myocardial infarction , intense inflammatory cascade unleash . The architecture leave ventricle rearranges , lead ventricular remodeling . The `` homing process '' involve stem cell migration sit injury ischemia , provide environment favorable growth function . This microenvironment stimulus home differentiation stem cell appropriate lineage . It increase vascular permeability expression adhesion protein like integrin , along home receptor facilitate attachment , mediate cell-to-cell contact chemoattractant release local tissue injury.The migratory capacity stem cell might dependent natural growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) stem cell factor ( SCF ) .The expression VEGF , SDF-1 SCF highly up-regulated hypoxic tissue , support hypothesis factor may represent home signal crucial recruitment circulate progenitor cell assist endogenous repair mechanism infarcted tissue . This study examine whether cardiac rehabilitation increase concentration stem cell factor release bloodstream factor correlate improvement heart function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Efficacy Mechanism Cardiac Rehabilitation Stem Cell Mobilization Heart Failure Improvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise training beneficial hemodynamic effect patient congestive heart failure.A similar benefit may see MI , improvement functional capacity average 20 percent . More important , however , possible effect survival . In meta-analysis 24 trial examine effect cardiac rehabilitation MI , significant reduction mortality rehabilitation ( odds ratio 0.81 ) . Previous study focus effect rehabilitation come improvement oxygen utilization skeletal muscle . The effect cardiac morphology perfusion status rather little addressed . In study , collect questionaires , blood sample assay stem cell factor , maximal O2 consumption , cardiac MRI cardiac rehabilitation.SDF-1 ( stromal cell derive factor-1 ) , SCF ( stem cell factor ) , VEGF ( vasculoendothelial growth factor ) measure ELISA . Cardiac MRI provide information ( 1 ) LV function , ( 2 ) scar size , ( 3 ) perfusion status ( dipyridamole stress MRI ) .</detailed_description>
