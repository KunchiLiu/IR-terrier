	<brief_summary>Orbicularis oculus muscle key structure peri-orbital anatomy responsible major change age area . Peri-orbital rejuvenation issue great interest plastic surgery . We believe understand age-related histomorphometric change orbicularis oculi muscle important improve current rejuvenation technique develop new one . Nevertheless , study focus topic never perform , simply difficult dangerous perform needle biopsy orbicularis oculi muscle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Age-Related Changes Myosin Heavy Chain Composition Human Orbicularis Oculi Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hundreds people come hospital request upper blepharoplasty every year . Taking advantage discard soft tissue blepharoplasty surgery , sample bilateral orbicularis oculi muscle easily obtain patient various age . This study design objectively evaluate age-related change human orbicularis oculi muscle analyze composition isoforms myosin heavy chain ( MHC ) , predominant protein skeletal muscle . MHC isoforms exist different type muscle fiber , determines maximum contraction speed muscle fiber . Therefore , The composition MHC isoforms represent composition different type muscle fiber . These muscle specimen store liquid nitrogen right surgery . In lab , specimen section 40Î¼m thickness , soak special buffer solution . After electrophoresis staining , band different type MHC visualize . The gel scan process image analysis system . The density band determine , ratio different type MHC calculate . By divide subject orbicularis oculi muscle sample upper blepharoplasty operation age group 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 70 year , MHC subtypes composition ratio compare among different group . Therefore , age-related change composition different muscle type conclude .</detailed_description>
