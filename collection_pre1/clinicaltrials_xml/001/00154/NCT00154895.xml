	<brief_title>Additional Minocycline Pleurodesis After Thoracoscopic Procedures Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Methods Study design This study randomize trial additional minocycline pleurodesis VATS primary spontaneous pneumothorax . It begin June 2001 Thoracic Surgical Division , National Taiwan University Hospital . After VATS primary spontaneous pneumothorax , eligible patient randomly assign additional minocycline pleurodesis observation . The primary end point rate ipsilateral recurrence operation . Secondary end point include safety , early postoperative result , long-term effect minocycline pleurodesis . Consents obtain patient thorough explanation . The protocol approve Institutional Review Board National Taiwan University Hospital . Eligibility criteria All patient require VATS cause ipsilateral recurrence , continuous air leak &gt; 3 day , contralateral recurrence , presence hemopneumothorax , uncomplicated first episode profession risk eligible study . The exclusion criterion : great 50 year age , underlie pulmonary disease , previous ipsilateral thoracic operation , allergy tetracycline minocycline , unwillingness randomization . Operative technique VATS After confirmation patient eligibility , either conventional needlescopic VATS perform patient choice . The cost operation cosmetic result main point consider patient make choice . The cost needlescopic VATS high conventional VATS National Health Insurance cover part disposable equipment . Our previous study show short-term result recurrence rate techniques comparable , although needlescopic VATS provide well cosmetic result less residual chest pain.19 Conventional VATS perform standard fashion general anesthesia use intubation double-lumen endotracheal tube . The patient place lateral decubitus position , ipsilateral lung deflate . A 10-mm , 30-degree telescope ( Karl Storz , Tuttlingen , Germany ) first insert examine pleural cavity . Two 15-mm skin incision make third fourth intercostal space , anterior posterior axillary line . Light pleural adhesion free use electrocautery . When bleb identify , grasp ring forceps excise 45-mm endoscopic stapler . Blind apical staple do suspicious area bleb could identify . The entire parietal surface abrade insert dissector strip diathermy scratch pad port site . After postoperative lung reinflation , normal saline solution instill check air leak . A chest tube ( 28F ) place apex one insertion wound . The surgical specimen routinely send pathological examination . The anesthesia , preparation , operative procedure needlescopic VATS almost identical conventional VATS . However , two set independent video-thoracoscopic equipment monitor , one needlescopic videothoracoscopy 10-mm videothoracoscopy , use simultaneously place near patient ’ head . Basically , use 10-mm videothoracoscopy surgical step . A needlescope indicate need chest tube wound insert endoscopic stapler ring forceps , extract specimen , perform pleural abrasion.19 Postoperative care minocycline pleurodesis The patient extubated operate theater observe 1 2 hour recovery room . Postoperative analgesic include routine oral , non-steroid analgesic acetaminophen . Intensity postoperative pain evaluate visual analogue scale ( VAS ; zero represent pain 10 represent intractable pain ) first , second , third postoperative day . Intramuscular meperidine hydrochloride ( Demerol® , 50mg/ampule ) administer every 4 6 hour accord patient ’ request pain become intolerable , could relieve oral analgesic , visual analogue scale great 7 . Chest radiography perform immediate postoperatively next morning . The chest tube connect low-pressure suction system around –10 –20 cmH2O lung fully expand . Randomization treatment regimen Patients randomize additional minocycline pleurodesis ( minocycline group ) observation ( observation group ) lung expand . Randomization accomplish accord chart number , randomly assign kind workup management . When chart number even , patient allocate minocycline group . When chart number odd , patient allocate observation group . In minocycline group , 20 mL 2 % lidocaine hydrochloride ( 400mg ) follow solution 20 mL normal saline contain 300 400 mg ( 7mg/kg ) minocycline ( Mirocin® , Taiwan Panbiotic Laboratories , Kaohsiung , Taiwan ) instill pleural cavity thoracostomy tube . The rubber tube connect chest tube chest bottle raise 40 60 cm patient trap minocycline allow air pas pressure . Patients reposition every 30 minute minocycline could contact pleural surface . Side effect complaint patient record . The rubber tube lower 6 8 hour later . To optimize effect pleural symphysis , minocycline administer full expansion lung , usually accomplish first postoperative day . However , patient persistent air leak could fully inflate lung , minocycline still use 3 5 day wait . In observation group , nothing instill . A blinded study conduct saline instillation suitable experiment pain associate minocycline injection would unmask blinding ; use saline injection would place patient unnecessary risk contamination pleural space . When prolonged air leak develop observation group , patient still undergo minocycline instillation although analysis base intent-to-treat method . The tube remove group lung fully expand air leak note 24-hour period . All complication operation record . Prolonged air leak define air leak last longer 5 day . Pleural detachment define pneumothorax develop right removal chest tube . Follow-up After discharge hospital , patient follow outpatient clinic 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month chest radiography perform . Follow-ups conduct every 6 month register nurse blind group allocation telephone conversation , accord standard questionnaire include patient return work school , whether recurrence occur , happen , treat . Residual postoperative chest pain evaluate pain score 0 5 , 0 pain free ; 1 occasional discomfort ; 2 occasional use analgesic ; 3 use nonopiate analgesic ; 4 regular pain use opiate ; 5 severe intractable pain . All patient follow least 12 month . Patients come back clinic visit emergency department whenever chest pain , dyspnea , sign related recurrence pneumothorax . Postoperative pulmonary function analysis Postoperative pulmonary function test perform patient able attend hospital outpatient appointment least 6 month surgery . Forced vital capacity ( FVC ) force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1.0 ) measure use spirometer Microspiro HI-298 ( Chest Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) patient seat . A minimum three acceptable force expiratory maneuver perform best one select analysis . Data collection statistical analysis The clinical data , operative finding , operation time , duration postoperative chest drainage , length hospital stay , complication , request dos meperidine , data VAS collect . A sample size 446 patient ( 223 group ) originally assume reach clinical significance ( .05 level power 0.8 ) minocycline reduce recurrence rate 9.8 % 2.9 % .18 A plan interim analysis conduct March 2005 enrollment 200 patient least 12 month follow-up . Statistical analysis perform intent-to-treat basis rather actual treatment basis . This study terminate earlier expect interim analysis show significant reduced rate recurrence patient receive minocycline pleurodesis . Continuous variable age weight express mean + standard deviation analyze two sample t-test . Categorical variable gender smoke status present frequency ( % ) analyze Fisher ’ exact test . Intensity postoperative pain measure VAS ( 0 10 ) summarize mean ( 95 percent confidence interval ) compare Wilcoxon rank-sum test . Scores residual chest pain analyze Wilcoxon rank-sum test . Freedom recurrence analyze Kaplan-Meier method , comparison make log-rank test . To identify factor associate recurrence pneumothorax , Cox regression model analyse age ( &lt; 25 v ≧25 ) , sex ( male v female ) , smoke status ( yes v ) , operation indication ( ipsilateral recurrence v others ) , operation method ( needlescopic v conventional VATS ) , number bleb ( 1 2 v 0 ≧3 ) , number endoscopic stapler cartridge , meperidine usage ( yes v ) , dose request meperidine , presence complication ( yes v ) perform . A p value le 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
