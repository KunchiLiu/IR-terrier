	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate infectious etiology Kawasaki disease ( KD ) ; prospective household case control study Kawasaki disease do . The investigator enroll Kawasaki disease case least five following manifestation : 1. fever 5 day 2. neck lymphadenopathy 3. lip fissure and/or strawberry tongue 4. skin rash 5. nonpurulent bulbar conjunctivitis 6. palm/sole erythema induration follow desquamation , coronary artery aneurysm le 5 manifestation ( atypical Kawasaki disease ) The KD case receive virological ( virus isolation blood , throat swab rectal swab stool , gene chip possible virus store RNA DNA ) , bacterial ( blood , throat swabs stool : bacterial culture store strain toxin superantigen detection ) , serological ( Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydiae pneumoniae , ASLO , HHV6 , EV71 , peptide library approach auto-antibody pathogen-related antibody , store serum workup ) workup . Stored DNA blood also perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient Selection Family Surveillance : At National Taiwan University Hospital Taiwan , study patient fulfill criterion Kawasaki disease atypical Kawasaki disease household family member 2004 Dec 2005 . Institutional Review Board approval obtain study informed consent obtain subject parent . If patient emergent service , outpatient clinic inpatient ward clinical syndrome suggestive EV71 infection , household family member ask participate study . Throat rectal swab virus isolation , first blood sample . Clinical manifestation , course outcomes record . If point patient suspect infection display clinical symptom , family member household ask undergo screen virus isolation throat swab , receive first blood sample . Questionnaire-based interview use collect information include demographic data , number bedroom household , contact time , pattern presence current/recent sign symptom ( cough , rhinorrhea , sore throat , rash , fever , abdominal pain diarrhea ) precede contact history extra-household people clinical illness . Follow-up telephone interview repeat question sign symptom 2 , 4 8-week interval . If household family member report experience sign symptom suggestive Kawasaki disease follow-up period , household member receive clinical assessment repeat laboratory investigation Kawasaki disease . A second blood sample obtain KD case household family member 4 week first blood sample obtain . Control case selection : An age- sex-matched control randomly select . The control admit patient ward diagnosis ( pneumonia , UTI , tonsillitis ) . They also receive screen virus bacterial workup household member . Definitions Kawasaki disease atypical Kawasaki disease : 1 . Criteria Kawasaki disease : - equal five following : fever 5 day , non-purulent conjunctivitis , skin rash , palm/sole induration erythema follow desquamation , neck lymphadenopathy , strawberry tongue lip fissure/bleeding 2 . Atypical Kawasaki disease ; le five coronary artery aneurysm . Laboratory Methods 1 . Virus Isolation Serotyping : Throat swab , rectal swab stool sample submit virus isolation . Samples inoculate human embryonic fibroblast , LLC-MK2 , HEp-2 rhabdomyosarcoma ( RD ) cell culture . When cytopathic effect involve 50 % cell monolayer , cell scrap subject indirect fluorescent antibody stain specific antibody ( Chemicon International Inc. , Temecula , CA ) type specific method accord suspected type virus . 2 . Molecular diagnosis virus pathogens difficult cultivate : 1 . Viral RNA RNA extraction : RNA DNA extraction perform use Isolation Kit accord manufacturer 's guide . ( RNA extraction kit , Qiagen ) . 140 uL throat swab mixed AVL buffer 10 15 minute room temperature . Then , spin mixture . Add 560 uL 100 % alcohol pellet incubate least 10 minute room temperature . The mixture put spin column centrifuge 8000 rpm 1 minute twice . Then , 500uL AW1 buffer add mixture centrifuge 80000 rpm 1 minute , 500uL AW2 buffer add centrifuge 14000 rpm 3 minute . Discard solution centrifuge 14000 rpm 2 minute . Finally , 25 30 uL AVE buffer add centrifuged 8000 10000 rpm 1 minute . 2 . Reverse transcription : RT perform 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit RT-PCR ( Roche ) . Mix previously extract RNA reagent include buffer , MgCl2 , dNTP , Oligo-p ( dT ) 15 primer , RNase inhibitor , reverse transcriptase , briefly vortex , incubate reaction 25oC 10 minute 42oC 60 minute . Finally incubate 99oC 5 minute cool 4oC 5 minute . 3 . Real-time TagMan PCR enterovirus , adenovirus viral etiology . The primer probe enterovirus virus real time PCR follow table . Primers probe PanEV select base highly conserved region 5'-untranslated region enterovirus genome . The primer probe EV71 select base diverse specific genetic region VP1 region enterovirus genome . Other potential virus , adenovirus , respiratory virus also perform PCR RT-PCR real-time PCR follow rule procedure . 4 . Representational differential analysis follow subtractive cloning 3 . Bacterial culture toxin detection : Cultures obtain pharynx , rectum patient acute KD start immune globulin intravenous infusion control patient use Baxter Diagnostics Culturette system contain cotton swab . The primary data collection sheet complete held site specimen obtain . The plate examine Ã¢-hemolytic group A streptococci S aureus coagulase positive tube test . These isolates screen blinded fashion presence bacterial superantigen production immunodiffusion antiserum know staphylococcal streptococcal superantigens describe previously . ( Lee PK Schlieveret PM ) . 4 . Serological test : Serological test antibody detection Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydiae pneumoniae , ASLO measure commercial kit . Neutralizing antibody enterovirus perform standard protocol neutralization test microtiter plate . EV71 isolate TW/2272/98 amplify purified antigen m-capture ELISA EV71 IgM Detection . If potential pathogen define , serology test specific pathogen do later . 5 . Statistical Analysis : Data analyze SAS Statistical Package ( Version 8.2 , SAS Institute , Cary , North Carolina ) . We use Student 's test continuous variable c 2 test categorical data . After univariate analysis screen statistically significant variable , forward stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis perform adjust confounders simultaneously calculate multivariate-adjusted odds ratio . The level model selection set 0.15 in-and-out model . P &lt; .05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
