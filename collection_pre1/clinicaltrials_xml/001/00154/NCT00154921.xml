	<brief_summary>Traditional biopsy require removal , fixation , stain tissue human body . Its procedure invasive painful . Non-invasive vivo optical biopsy thus require , provide non-invasive , highly penetrative , three-dimensional ( 3D ) image sub-micron spatial resolution . Optical biopsy base scan two-photon fluorescence microscopy ( TPFM ) good method biopsy skin due high lateral resolution , low out-of-focus damage , intrinsic three-dimensional ( 3D ) section capability . However current technology still present several limitation include low penetration depth , in-focus cell damage , multi-photon phototoxicity due high optical intensity 800 nm wavelength region , toxicity exogenous fluorescence marker require . We study harmonic optical biopsy human skin sample use femtosecond Cr : forsterite laser center 1230 nm . Higher harmonic generation know leave energy deposition interact matter due energy-conservation characteristic . This energy-conservation characteristic provide “ noninvasive ” nature desirable clinical imaging . In study , evaluate clinical application optical skin biopsy use harmonic generation microscopy .</brief_summary>
