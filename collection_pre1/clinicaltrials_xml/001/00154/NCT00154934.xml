	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia severe complication human pregnancy . It occur 4-5 % pregnancy remain leading cause maternal neonatal mortality morbidity . The pathophysiology syndrome fully understood . Two theory propose explain development preeclampsia : defective trophoblast invasion first trimester , poor maternal immunoregulation fetus . Pro-inflammatory cytokine induce second mechanism , subsequent generalize endothelial dysfunction mother . Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) play major role pathway . According recent literature , debate still exist role IL-10 pathogenesis preeclampsia . IL-10 may increase immunoregulation ( seemingly development preeclampsia ) , also prohibit extravillous trophoblast invasion hand ( seemingly towards development preeclampsia ) . According recent authoritative journal , expression IL-10 pre-eclamptic placenta increase ; influential journal totally contrary result . We believe diverse exhibition may due overlook paracrine effect decidual cell ( representative maternal environment ) , vitro culture condition parallel physiological condition . Our experiment first obtain qualification Ethical Committee hospital permission examine patient . We first collect serum sample preeclampsia patient analyze IL-10 level ELISA kit , compare normal control . Then isolate trophoblast pre-eclamptic woman normal control . These trophoblast treat ( 1 ) co-cultured decidual cell line ( 2 ) Lipofectamine transfection IL-10 ( overexpression IL-10 ) ( 3 ) signal interference ribonucleotide ( siRNA ) IL-10 ( knockdown IL-10 function ) . Each group ( include trophoblast alone patient normal control ) subject analysis IL-10 mRNA amount RT-PCR . Further experiment treat trophoblast transwell migration assay invasion assay , matrix metalloproteinase assay determine change invasive capacity ; Fas ligand expression determine change immunoregulation . Our effort determine role IL-10 pathogenesis preeclampsia , also development siRNA IL-10 may give light treatment preeclampsia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Pregnancy , pre-eclampsia immune regulation The preeclampsia syndrome , characterize change placenta uteroplacental vasculature , major concern impair human pregnancy . Hypertension , proteinuria exaggerate edema typical clinical symptoms1 . Although etiology disease uncertain , well establish defect placental trophoblast invasion implantation contribute inadequate remodel uterine spiral artery , thereby initiate focal region reduce perfusion within placenta2 . It suggest consequence placental ischemia generation cytotoxic factor may act systemically activate injure endothelium3 . The identity factor elaborate placenta , presumably compromise endothelial function preeclampsia , unknown . Inflammatory cytokine , tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , know potent activator vascular endothelium propose mediator endothelial dysfunction preeclampsia4 . It well know acceptance fetoplacental unit human pregnancy require maternal immune tolerance , think regulate locally placenta . Therefore anti-inflammatory cytokine , interleukin-10 play critical role different pregnancy disorder , include preeclampsia5 . Placental interleukin identify reproductive tissue , role adaptive maternal immunity determine term pregnancy outcomes fully clarify . The acceptance fetoplacental unit maternal uterine surface require element immunological tolerance . Local antiplacental immunity modify synthesis uncommon histocompatibility Ags , growth factor , cytokine placenta . The presence immune cell decidual tissue uterus also present potential barrier , physical immunological , development placenta6 . Some characteristic fetoplacental unit encourage endometrial myometrial invasion7 others modify immunological barrier ( e.g . HLA-G ) 8 . These characteristic placental function may abnormal formative stage placental development , thus presumptive uterine barrier may abnormal preeclampsia , complication human pregnancy relate shallow placental development9 . 2 . Interleukin-10 Interleukin-10 originally identify product Th2-type T lymphocytes inhibits synthesis Th-1 type cytokine Interferon-gamma IL-210 . IL-10 known secrete Th2-helper T cell , CD4+HT2 cell , B cell lymphoma mast cell line . The protein undergo post-translational modification include N-glycosylation formation critical cysteine bond . IL-10 inhibits cytokine synthesis T cell NK cell control macrophage-monocyte accessory cell . IL-10 elicits response granulocyte , eosinophil , mast cell , B cell , T cell NK cells11 . IL-10 crucial limit inflammatory response disease state . The ability IL-10 inhibit macrophage activation allow investigation `` cross-talk '' stimulatory inhibitory cytokine . IL-10 important understanding autoimmunity target molecule development anti-rejection therapies12 . The Th-like response cytokine make suitable adjuvant immunization development10 . Human mouse IL-10 73 % homologous amino acid level . Human IL-10 active mouse cell line , human cell line responsive mouse IL-10 . 3 . Maintenance pregnancy interleukin-10 production Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) immunosuppressive cytokine express throughout pregnancy epithelial cell leukocytes endometrium placenta . The anti-inflammatory immune deviate property IL-10 well characterize . Principally mediate inhibit proliferation pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis type 1 T helper ( Th1 ) cell , program specific phenotype macrophage dendritic cell stimulate natural killer ( NK ) cell activation . IL-10 show normal placental cell ( trophoblast cell ) suppress mixed lymphocyte response vitro13 . Maternal bone marrow-derived cell uterine wall include NK-like cell T cells14 may modify placental IL-10 production . Modification local maternal antifetal immune response show important patient recurrent spontaneous abortion15 . IL-10 identify important cytokine pregnancy . IL-10 may involve maintenance pregnancy corpus luteum maturation progesterone production16 . In well-known mouse cross prone spontaneous abortion deficiency IL-10 demonstrate alter net fetal number outcome17 . Longitudinal study mice demonstrate sequential change cytokine profile include IL-10 peripheral blood release spleen element pregnancy advances18,19 . IL-10 inhibition second half pregnancy mouse cause fetal growth retardation20 . Besides , progesterone show increase Th2-type response T cells21 . Taken together , data suggest early pregnancy associate increase circulate Th2 cytokine IL-10 fetal placental growth development depend adequate IL-10 production . Or brief , IL-10 may fetal protective effect . In human pregnancy shift cytokine production Th1-type inflammatory cytokine Th2 type cytokine predominance IL-10 IL-4 IL-2 TNF-α stimulate PBMC . This balance alter preeclamptic mononuclear cell alternative result , relative decrease IL-10 compare pro-inflammatory cytokine production22 . 4 . Interleukin-10 trophoblast motility invasion capacity Interleukin-10 , express decidua placenta , implicate regulate extravillous cytotrophoblast invasion inhibit matrix metalloproteinase expression influence quality maternal immune response . Cytotrophoblast invasion vitro require expression matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) . In recent article , author show cytotrophoblasts produce interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) , potent immunomodulatory cytokine could paracrine effect maternal immune system . IL-10 synthesis dramatically downregulated first 12 h culture , MMP-9 secretion rapidly upregulated cell acquire invasive phenotype.13 These observation prompt subsequent experiment investigate whether IL-10 autocrine regulator cytotrophoblast MMP-9 production . Adding recombinant IL-10 cytotrophoblast culture significantly decrease cell ' MMP-9 expression protein mRNA level , affect mRNA level tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-3.23 Thus , IL-10 may alter proteinase/inhibitor balance . IL-10 treatment cause net decrease MMP activity , thereby reduce cytotrophoblast invasiveness . Together , current data suggest IL-10 autocrine inhibitor cytotrophoblast MMP-9 activity invasiveness . 5 . Controversies interleukin-10 development preeclampsia Endothelial cell dysfunction hypothesize major contributor pathogenesis pre-eclampsia . This hypertensive disease pregnancy characterize change placenta , uteroplacental vasculature , kidney , liver consistent endothelial damage . Hypertension vascular hypersensitivity pressor , neutrophil activation , platelet activation also demonstrate preeclampsia consistent endothelial dysfunction.24 Inflammatory cytokine know potent activator vascular endothelium propose mediator endothelial dysfunction preeclampsia.25 Both tumor necrosis factor α ( TNFα ) interleukin 1 β ( IL-1β ) , interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) induce functional alteration endothelial cells.26 Although association inflammatory cytokine development pre-eclampsia ( PE ) generally assume , actual mechanism , mode dysregulation still strong debate . In two authoritative journal , author describe dysregulation cytokine expression occur pre-eclamptic placenta , overexpression IL-10 mRNA placenta tissue elevate plasma level ( Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999 ; 181:915-20 ; Obstet Gynecol 2002 ; 100:327-31 ) .27,28 In contrast , another influential journal describes deficiency plasma production IL-10 decreasing plasma level IL-10 ( J Immunology , 1999 , 163 : 3491-5 ) 29 . Authors also measure IL-10 release vitro culture CTB PE patient . The result also show significantly alternation IL-10 release vitro culture PE CTB ( Cytokine 23 2003 ; 23:119-25 ) 30 . We believe study CTB enough explain pathogenesis preeclampsia . CTB , also implantation environment also express IL-10 inflammatory cytokine . We suggest assess situ specimen include placenta tissue placental bed biopsy may include influence CTB implantation environment . Besides , IL-10 play role pathogenesis preeclampsia , alter expression IL-10 level may restore PE phenotype normal behavior . This purpose observation follow study .</detailed_description>
