	<brief_title>Identification Biomarkers Associated With Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma SELDI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) lead cause cancer death Taiwan . Above 6000-8000 people die cancer every year Taiwan . Though regular sonographic examination early detect small HCC many therapeutic modality HCC , therapeutic result remain unsatisfactory . Though Alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) des-γ-carboxy prothrombin ( DCP ) use tumor marker diagnosis HCCs , AFP normal around one third small ( &lt; 3cm ) HCC patient . Elevated DCP activity present 44 % -47.6 % HCCs le 3cm . Thus , two marker good enough early detection small HCCs . To improve survival , investigation early diagnostic marker still need . The global analysis cellular protein recently term proteomics key area research develop postgenomic ear . With respect cancer , proteomics potential identify novel target therapy marker diagnosis . The proteomic profiling technique biomarker discovery include ( 1 ) 2-D PAGE / MALDI-MS ( two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ) / matrix assist laser desorption / ionization-mass spectrometry ) , ( 2 ) LC/MS/MS ( liquid chromatography/MS/MS ) , ( 3 ) SELDI-TOF ( surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight ) . These technique advantage shortcoming . SELDI recently descry modification MALDI-TOP small amount protein directly apply biochip coat specific chemical matrix ( hydrophobic , cationic , anionic , normal phase , forth ) biochemical molecule DNA oligonucleotides purify protein . The bound protein retain wash analyzed mass spectrometry obtain protein fingerprint sample . The detected protein display series peak . SELDI-TOF MS offer high-throughput protein profile . Blood , urine , body fluid , tissue specimen take patient applied onto different ProteinChip Arrays . The difference protein expression profile two distinct sample thus obtain . SELDI approach successfully use identify biomarkers various cancer , prostate cancer , bladder cancer , ovarian cancer , lung cancer , colon cancer , breast cancer pancreatic cancer . In current project apply SELDI technique identify HCC biomarkers . Sera sample HCC patient relevant control collect . The sample apply SELDI analysis . We hope find new HCC biomarkers . If biomarkers HCC identify , use clinical application possible early detection HCCs .</detailed_description>
