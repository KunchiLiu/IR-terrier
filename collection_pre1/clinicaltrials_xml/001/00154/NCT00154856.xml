	<brief_title>Influence Mechanical Stimulus Distraction Osteogenesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone lengthen use distraction osteogenesis find many clinical application treatment limb length discrepancy , limb deformity , bone defect fracture nonunion . Animal study show mechanical condition significantly affect biological process osteogenesis . Knowledge influence mechanical stimulus formation bone thus essential improvement current technique , contribute treatment care patient receive bone lengthening . Previous vivo human study approach problem measure interfragmentary movement bone fracture load limb term ground reaction force . The mechanical environment callus available approach . As stress strain behavior bone critical normal function , response bone osteotomy osteogenesis , limited number study use simplified FEM technique examine strain stress pattern callus two dimension simplify loading condition . The calculated strain pattern , however , far real situation callus . No data available stress strain pattern process distraction osteogenesis . The present study step current one-year NSC project , aim bridge above-mentioned gap continuously monitor mechanical stimulus apply limb callus , experimental measurement FEM calculation , correlate observe quantity quality mechanical stimulus calculate stress strain pattern callus tissue . Specifically , propose study , 3D finite element model osteogenesis four temporal point limb lengthen process subject develop CT data osteotomy site . A 3D model musculoskeletal model lower limb use calculate force transmit bone surround tissue , use subsequent FEM analysis . The purpose study determine stress strain pattern callus different distraction stage , data collect gait laboratory experiment perform current NSC project , provide clear picture influence mechanical stimulus distraction osteogenesis . It hop present study lead well understanding mechanisms osteogenesis , helpful find appropriate fixation method distraction osteogenesis optimize mechanical environment bone formation .</detailed_description>
