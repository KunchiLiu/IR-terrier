	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) prevalent physical disability originate childhood . Crouch gait common gait abnormality patient cerebral palsy , common treat hamstring lengthening . This surgery alter mechanical property lower limb affect ability generate force hamstring , leading change functional activity . Therefore , first aim study investigate effect hamstring lengthen pelvis hip control perform functional activity , include level walk sit-to-stand . Gait motion analysis use widely diagnosis patient locomotor pathology subsequent planning assessment treatment . Ten subject diagnose spastic diplegic cerebral palsy crouch gait recruit ten healthy control recruit study inform consent . Detailed physical examination motion analysis experiment perform normal group spastic diplegic patient hamstring lengthen follow ip six month . The subject would ask perform level walk self-selected pace sit-to-stand armless chair . For test , subject would repeat least 5 time , kinematic , kinetic EMG data collect simultaneously . With thorough analysis comparison data , hop reference clinical decision hamstring lengthen establish , complete knowledge effect hamstring lengthening , helpful future clinical rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
