	<brief_summary>Hypothermic resuscitation proven benefit cardiac origin cardiac arrest patient improve brain recovery dramatically . However , traditional cooling device method , external cooling method , include ice blanket , cool helmet , ice pack low body temperature slowly inefficiently make many emergency physician hesitate perform hypothermic resuscitation . To improve promote practice hypothermia resuscitation , efficient temperature control method necessary . We conduct clinical trial evaluate safety feasibility internal cooling catheter temperature regulatory device , approve FDA neurologic ICU temperature control , cardiac arrest patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Feasibility Endovascular Cooling Device Patients With Hypothermic Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We recruit successful resuscitate nontraumatic cardiac arrest adult patient emergency department evaluate safety feasibility application invasive internal temperature regulator device . Internal cooling catheter , `` ICY '' , thermal regulator device , `` Coolguard 2000 '' apply patient femoral vein . WE definite 4 stage accord temperature clinical trial : `` The Cooling Phase '' , `` Hypothermia phase '' , `` Rewarming phase '' , `` Postrewarming phase '' . The temperature low elevated rate 0.5C/hr Cooling Rewarming Phase , maintain 33 +/- 1 C hypothermia phase 12 hour accord comment ACLS . To understand safety feasibility , regular blood sampling , bedside EEG vital monitor , special sheet design document every reason , time point every clinical event hypothermia therapy . The patient observe rewarming finish 48 hour till death expire post-resuscitation hypothermia therapy .</detailed_description>
