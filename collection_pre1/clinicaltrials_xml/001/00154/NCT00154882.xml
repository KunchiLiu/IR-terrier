	<detailed_description>Breast cancer one leading cause cancer death woman Taiwan . We recently demonstrate combination paclitaxel cisplatin , conventional dos , highly effective treatment breast cancer . However , acute cumulative toxicity paclitaxel troublesome significant portion patient . Several line evidence suggest weekly paclitaxel , much low dose range 40 50 mg/m2 per week , may effective conventional dos paclitaxel ( 80 90 mg/m2 per week ) patient metastatic ovarian lung cancer .
