	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study DCB-AD1 Patients With Mild Moderate Alzheimer ’ Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The grow number patient dementia become great concern many age society . Up moment treatment stop Alzheimer ’ dementia ( AD ) , thus , develop new treatment still mandatory . In study investigate new drug DCB-AD1 , herbal medicine derive root Fo-ti . Historically Chinese use Fo-ti root rejuvenate property treat premature age , weakness . In DCB ( Development Center Biotechnology ) ’ preliminary study use human neuroblastoma cell , SK-N-SH , Fo-ti water extract exhibit high potential prevent A-beta hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death . From two different AD animal model , DCB observe neuroprotection effect Fo-ti use water maze hole-board exploration test , Though pharmacological effect Fo-ti yet clarify , protective effect may result radical scavenging activity , anti-inflammatory effect anti-peroxidation . We intend investigate DCB-AD1 cognitive neurophysiological effect Alzheimer disease randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled therapeutic trial 24 week . We complete 80 eligible case analysis clinical trial 40 investigation site . The estimated drop-out rate around 25~30 % . Patients eligible fulfill criterion diagnosis probable AD NINCDS-ADRDA . We include patient Mini-Mental State Examination score 12~24 Clinical Dementia Rating 1 2 . Patients allow take cholinesterase inhibitor , donepezil , rivastigmine , galantamine memantine dose unchanged last 3 month study entry remain stable 24-week study period . As outcome measure , primary end point score change ADAS-Cog end treatment baseline . Secondary end point include CIBIC-PLUS , IADL , Behav-AD , MMSE CDR . The statistic analysis intention-to-treat complete case . Because limitation sample size would expect positive trend efficacy unless effect size DCB-AD1 large 0.63 . This information provide u clue clinical investigation phase III study carry even large scale . We valuable experience adverse effect prolong ( 24-week ) use Fo-ti .</detailed_description>
