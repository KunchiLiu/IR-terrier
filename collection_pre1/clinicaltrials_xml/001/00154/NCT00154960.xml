	<brief_summary>In , want present new method analysis variation gene copy number patient carrier SMA . This relative quantitation method , therefore , rely inclusion one internal control reference sequence ; quantitation DNA relative reference sequence know copy number . A peak height within potentially duplicate deleted target region amplify simultaneously disomic reference region multiplex PCR system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Proximal spinal muscular atrophy autosomal recessive disorder overall incidence 1 10000 live birth carrier frequency 1 50 . This severe neuromuscular disease characterize degeneration loss alpha motor neuron spinal cord anterior horn cell , result progressive symmetrical weakness , atrophy proximal voluntary muscle , infant death . Here , present new , rapid , simple high reliable method detect SMN1 deletion determine copy number SMN1 SMN2 denature high-performance liquid chromatography ( DHPLC ) . We demonstrate assay able accurately distinguish 2 gene copy 4 gene copy identify SMA carrier normal population accurate determination SMN copy number . Fecal DNA test promise tool colorectal cancer screening . Researchers show DNA good marker since stable stool ; shed continuously ; , use amplification test , detect minute amount . Many DNA mutation associate process colon cancer carcinogenesis characterize . K-ras oncogene , adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) , p53 , microsatellite marker examples gene target DNA marker stool test critical control colorectal cell growth . Early clinical study show multitarget DNA test 71 % 91 % sensitivity detection cancer 55 % 82 % sensitivity detect adenoma 1cm large . We design study , use automate DHPLC analysis microsatellite marker set already first , stepwisely set-up high throughput sensitive specific screen method colorectal cancer screen . Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia common problem concern pediatrician also parent neonate . Two key enzyme , UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 ) , involve bilirubin metabolism highly notice . First , UGT1A1 key enzyme bilirubin conjugation mutation UGT1A1 cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemias know Crigler-Najjar syndrome Gilbert 's syndrome . The high allele-frequency Gly71Arg promoter polymorphism UGT1A1 gene find responsible neonatal hyperbilirubinemia without obvious cause . Second , HO-1 rate-limiting enzyme heme metabolism allow degradation heme biliverdin . Recently , Maruo et al . demonstrate ( 16/17 ) breastfed Japanese infant apparent prolonged jaundice least one mutation UGT1A1 . These data suggest defect UGT1A1 may underlie cause prolong unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia associate breast milk . However , date association breastfed infant severe hyperbilirubinemia UGT1A1 gene mutation still unclear . In study , analyze UGT1A1 HO-1 gene infant unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia associate breast milk ascertain whether genetic factor involve . This project contribute apply DHPLC establish various novel , fast , reliable application diagnosis SMA carrier detection SMN1 SMN2 gene , sensitive specific screen method colorectal cancer screen , analyze UGT1A1 HO-1 gene infant unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia associate breast milk .</detailed_description>
