	<detailed_description>Around world , majority hepatitis C patient suffer monoinfected chronic HCV infection . Current regimen group patient receive much attention result rapid advance [ McHutchison et al , 1998 ] . However , certain understudied population chronic hepatitis C [ Strader DB , 2002 ] . One important group patient co-infected HBV . In hepatitis B C endemic area , number subject dual infection hepatitis C B substantial [ Chen et al , 1990 ; Tsai et al , 1994 ; Liaw 1995 ; Pramoolsinsap et al , 1999 ] . For example , Taiwan , anti-HCV present 11 % patient HBV-related chronic liver disease [ Chen et al 1990 ; Liaw 1995 ] , HBsAg positive rate 12 % anti-HCV-positive patient [ Tsai et al , 1994 ] . In Italy , prevalence anti-HCV positivity high 40 % patient chronic active hepatitis B city [ Sagnelli et al , 1997 ] . Such co-infected patient rarely encounter developed country , except intravenous drug user , hemophiliac receive hemodialysis . Alarmingly , HCV- HBV- coinfected patient show carry great risk ( 1.5~5 fold ) develop LC HCC HCV HBV infection [ Liaw 1995 ; Donato et al , 1998 ; Yang et al , 2002 ; Sun et al , 2003 ] . Therefore , HBV HCV dually infect patient also need active treatment . Unfortunately , current therapeutic target ongoing protocol clinical trial recruit patient HCV infection invariably exclude co-infected HBV . Thus , warrant address important issue effective treatment hepatitis C B dually infect patient desperately need . Sporadic study show IFN alone effective clear HCV HBV patient dually infect hepatitis B C [ Liaw 1995 ; Liaw et al , 1997 ; Weltman et al , 1995 ; Mazzella et al , 1999 ; Guptan et al , 1999 ] . A recent study report dose augmentation IFN 9 MU thrice weekly 6 month could clear HCV 31 % patient [ Villa et al , 2001 ] . Apparently , efficacy still adequate . Because combine IFN RBV show yield much good result treatment chronic hepatitis C IFN alone [ Poynard et al , 1995 ; Davis et al , 1998 ; Reichard et al , 1998 ; McHutchison et al , 1998 ; Lai et al , 1996 ; Liaw et al , 1997 ; Schalm et al , 1999 ] , combination therapy might also effective treat dual hepatitis B C patient . To test , conduct pilot study use conventional IFN alfa plus ribavirin treat 24 patient coinfected HCV HBV . The 24-week combination regimen IFN ribavirin clear HCV 43 % ( 9/21 ) patient dually infect hepatitis B C. The result comparable patient monoinfected chronic hepatitis C. Normalization serum ALT obtain 38 % patient 24 week end treatment . In addition , find although end-of-treatment clearance rate HCV RNA comparable patient infect genotype 1b genotype 2a 2b , clearance HCV RNA sustain much less commonly infect HCV genotype 1b ( 21 % vs. 86 % , P &lt; 0.05 ) . Actually , two recent study southern Taiwan also demonstrate efficacy combination therapy use interferon plus ribavirin clearance serum HCV RNA comparable HBV HCV coinfected patient versus HCV monoinfected patient [ Wang et al. , 2003 ; Yu et al. , 2003 ] . Based finding , suggest comparable efficacy combination therapy use interferon plus ribavirin clearance serum HCV RNA achieve patient HBV HCV coinfected patient versus HCV monoinfected patient . Nevertheless , effective regimen still need dually infected patient , particularly HCV genotype 1 . In pilot study , treat 24 patient coinfected HCV HBV single group . The majority patient detectable hepatitis C viremia , anti-HBe positive low serum HBV titer . Therefore , hepatitic activity likely due HCV HBV . Nevertheless , patient HBeAg positive high serum HBV titer ( &gt; 105 copies/mL ) low undetectable serum HCV RNA . In , hepatitis likely due active hepatitis B . Importantly ; none dually infected patient predominantly active hepatitis B biochemical HCV virologic response end combination therapy 24 week post-treatment follow-up . These two group patient may need different anti-viral regimen accord major offend virus liver . To treat dual hepatitis C B patient dominantly active hepatitis C , may use IFN ( conventional pegylated form ) RBV , treatment schedule may extend one year enhance efficacy HCV genotype 1 . However , treat dually infected patient dominant HBV infection , treatment strategy may different . Our pilot study indicate HCV- HBV-coinfected patient predominantly active hepatitis C predominantly active hepatitis B may need different anti-viral regimen . Since majority coinfected patient hepatitis activity likely due HCV HBV , optimal therapeutic regimen HCV- HBV-coinfected patient predominantly active hepatitis C first investigate . The combination therapy use pegylated IFNs PEG-IFN alfa-2a show superior efficacy use conventional IFN treatment monoinfected chronic hepatitis C. This new combination therapy might also enhance treatment efficacy HCV- HBV- coinfected patient . We therefore propose initiate trial compare efficacy pegylated IFN plus RBV dual chronic hepatitis B C vs. chronic hepatitis C , HCV genotype 1 2/3 patient . The efficacy use 24-week combination therapy sustain clearance serum HCV RNA equivalent use 48-week combination therapy patient HCV genotype non-1 [ Hadziyannis et al , EASL 2002 ] . A 48-week course pegylated IFN RBV combination therapy , contrast , show yield well efficacy sustained clearance serum HCV RNA patient HCV genotype 1 24-week combination therapy western country [ Hadziyannis et al , EASL 2002 ; Poynard et al , 1998 ] . The primary objective current proposal investigate compare efficacy combination therapy use pegylated IFN plus RBV clearance serum HCV RNA dually infect patient dominant HCV infection HCV monoinfected patient . Therefore , proposal , treatment duration 24 week HCV genotype 2/3 patient dual chronic hepatitis C B patient monoinfected HCV , 48 week HCV genotype 1 patient dual chronic hepatitis C B patient monoinfected HCV .</detailed_description>
