	<brief_summary>1 . This phase II study radiotherapy patient locally advanced HCC . 2 . Patients whose tumor ( ) suitable local treatment , surgery , trans-arterial chemoembolization ( TAE ) , ethanol injection , radiofrequency ablation . enrol . 3 . Radical radiotherapy start pre-treatment evaluation . The total dose RT 50Gy 25 fraction local tumor ( ) . 4 . Dynamic contrast enhance MRI serum sample do follow time point assess change tumor perfusion : ( 1 ) start thalidomide treatment ; ( 2 ) 2weeks radiotherapy begin ; ( 3 ) 1 month radiotherapy complete . DCEMRI do every 3 month disease progression . 5 . The study design evaluate response rate tolerability radical radiotherapy locally advance HCC . The sample size determine expect incidence grade 4 toxicity response rate radiotherapy locally advance HCC . Since grade 4 toxicity radiotherapy alone 10 % , response rate 60 % need least 12 patient evaluate treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Radiotherapy Locally Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one common malignancy Asian country . Surgical resection potentially form curative treatment . However , less 20 % patient surgical candidate diagnosis . Nonsurgical treatment option include transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , percutaneous acetic acid ethanol injection therapy radio-frequency ablation . They sometimes unsatisfactory , especially patient portal vein thrombosis large infiltrative hepatic tumor . Repeated treatment often necessary . Radiotherapy ( RT ) treatment HCC attempt 4 decade . Early trial adopt whole liver irradiation use inadequate radiation dose . Because unsatisfactory result obtain low-dose whole liver irradiation , RT long consider treatment HCC . Recently , local , whole , liver RT attempt several investigator , show high dos radiation safely deliver portion liver alone combination nonsurgical modality . Their result suggest local RT effective component treatment regimen HCC . Development surrogate marker monitor response HCC radiotherapy important follow reason . First , response evaluate conventional imaging study usually slow may unreliable . The maximal response radiotherapy often achieve 6 month completion radiotherapy . The slow response radiotherapy make difficult modify ineffective treatment regimen timely fashion HCC , especially patient low serum a-fetal protein ( AFP ) . Second , intra-hepatic recurrence outside RT field common cause RT treatment failure . Nearly half patient recur RT lesion outside RT field . Inflammation normal liver damage cause RT may deleterious effect tumor control release cytokine angiogenic factor . Therefore , biological consequence RT tumor non-tumor liver parenchyma shall carefully evaluate . Dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( DCEMRI ) may assess hepatic perfusion parameter correlate severity cirrhosis portal hypertension . In cervical cancer , DCEMRI enable u evaluate microcirculation tumor well blood perfusion normal parenchyma . Malignancy , stage prognosis correlate enhancement parameter cervical , breast cancers.Several study show successful therapy also result change DCEMRI parameter , may prove accurate early indication response . De Vries et al report , rectal carcinoma patient receive preoperative radiotherapy , perfusion index show significant increase 1st 2nd week treatment . High perfusion index value correlate great lymph node down-staging . Moffat et al also report increased apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) 3 week initiation RT brain cancer patient well local response . Circulating angiogenic factor show provide important prognostic information variety cancer ( 21 ) . Elevated serum level VEGF bFGF associate increased invasiveness HCC . Placental growth factor ( PlGF ) , homolog VEGF , show synergistic effect VEGF pathologic angiogenesis , angiogenesis induce cancer ischemia , prognostic value human cancer remain unclear . We would like correlate functional image study blood flow serum cytokine radiotherapy treatment outcome hepatocellular carcinoma patient .</detailed_description>
