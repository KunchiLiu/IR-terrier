	<brief_summary>Cervical cancer frequent neoplasm woman Taiwan world . It influence 2,700 woman 1,000 woman die cervical cancer year Taiwan . Human papillomaviruses ( HPV ) consistently implicate cause cervical cancer especially high-risk type strongly associate cervical cancer . In recent year , compel evidence infection human papillomavirus ( HPV ) major etiologic factor development cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) cervical carcinoma . As virus-induced disease , adequate immune response likely play key role clearance HPV infection HPV-related lesion . This assumption bear epidemiological study animal model . Immune-compromised patient HIV-infected woman , organ transplant recipient , patient suffer forms malignancy , high risk develop CIN lesion invasive cervical cancer . Moreover , several study establish existence natural HPV E7-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) immunity human . Only minority woman infect oncogenic HPV type develop CIN cervical cancer . Indeed , majority CIN lesion progress even regress normal cytology , indicate factor inadequate immune function necessary development progressive CIN lesion cervical carcinoma . Consequently , HLA class I II phenotype may correlate effective immune response HPV-associated cervical lesion . Differences recognition foreign antigen , contribute allele HLA class I II locus , might propose affect risk develop cervical cancer . In present proposal , investigator would like examine HLA class I II association among Taiwanese woman cervical neoplasia . The purpose proposal : 1. address relationship HLA class I II haplotype , HPV infection , cervical cancer ; 2. elucidate immunologic response HPV type 16 different HLA class I II haplotype . It help investigator identify population HLA genotypes susceptible HPV infection progress invasive cervical cancer . The result research useful prevention screen cervical cancer future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . To survey incidence HPV infection CIN cervical cancer patient . Using epidemiologic data drawn wide range country population group , investigator find evidence HPV 90 % 95 % cervical cancer . The incidence HPV cervical cancer 79 % report . Besides , 91 % high-grade CIN case 50 % low-grade CIN case could attribute HPV infection Taiwanese woman . Because report Taiwanese woman publish around 10 year ago , important survey update incidence HPV CIN cervical cancer patient Taiwanese woman . We survey incidence HPV infection 500 cervical cancer patient , 100 patient CIN 100 normal population patient . 2 . To survey human leukocyte antigen haplotype CIN cervical cancer patient . HLA class I II allele report associate nasopharyngeal carcinoma Taiwan . Besides , human leukocyte antigen class I II allele might interplay response interferon-alpha treatment Taiwanese patient chronic hepatitis C virus infection . We detect HLA class I II haplotype first correlate CIN cervical cancer patient . 3 . To identify correlation HLA class I II haplotype HPV infection CIN cervical cancer . We survey correlation HLA class I II genotype HPV CIN cervical cancer patient . We identify HLA class I II haplotype positive negative correlation HPV infection , CIN cervical cancer . Then would determine specific HLA antigens important determine risk HPV infection , CIN cervical cancer . 4 . To elucidate immunologic response HPV type 16 HLA2 different II haplotype role immunogenetics carcinogenesis cervical cancer . HPV type 16 identify high incidence malignant HPV genotype cervical cancer . Our laboratory set immunologic assay evaluate immune response HPV type 16 . We survey immune response HPV type 16 HLA class I II haplotype positive negative correlation HPV infection cervical cancer . We would identify population HLA genotype susceptible HPV infection invasive cervical cancer elucidate role immunogenetics HPV infection carcinogenesis cervical cancer .</detailed_description>
