	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemoradiation Versus Wide Pelvic Lymphadenectomy Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project continuation previous study ( NTUH92-S044 ) focus comparison advantage disadvantage follow two treatment modality : ( 1 ) preoperative neoadjuvant therapy ( CCRT ) follow conventional surgery ; ( 2 ) Japanese-style wide pelvic lymphadenectomy , treatment potentially operable locally advanced rectal cancer . It well-known keypoint surgical treatment rectal cancer achieve balance ‘ radical resection tumor ’ ‘ functional preservation pelvic organ ’ . Primary adenocarcinoma rectum generally characterize localize comparatively slow-growing , compare fast-growing tumor gastrointestinal malignancy . Thus , extend systemic pelvic lymphadenectomy consider best choice cure . However , major difference concept Western Oriental colorectal surgeon regard appropriate extent lymphadenectomy treatment rectal cancer lie peritoneal reflection . Theoretically , two major pathway lymphatic drainage lower rectal cancer : one upward root inferior mesenteric artery ( IMA ) ; along middle hemorrhoidal artery obturator fossa . Because American people tend fatty pelvic lymphadenectomy difficult perform , rectal cancer patient receive conventional limited resection combine aggressive chemotherapy pelvic irradiation . In contrast , Oriental people thinner pelvic lymphadenectomy easier perform , important , Japanese surgeon meticulous cancer surgery , extend pelvic lymphadenectomy become routine procedure advance low rectal cancer Japan . However , extend pelvic lymphadenectomy inevitably cause autonomic nerve damage , thereafter result disturbance micturition sexual function . To overcome genitourinary complication , Japanese surgeon develop autonomic nerve-sparing surgery . Generally speak , pelvic autonomic nerve consist sympathetic signal via paired hypogastric nerve pair sacral splanchnic nerve , parasympathetic signal via pelvic splanchnic nerve . The sympathetic parasympathetic fiber intermingle form pelvic plexus , locate lateral side lateral ligament . Pelvic plexus send composite autonomic signal innervate distal rectum genitourinary organ . Thus , injury autonomic nerve reflect functional disorder anorectum genitourinary organ . Based neurophysiology , well know sympathetic nerve control ejaculatory function bladder neck closure . In contrast , parasympathetic nerve control penile erection bladder wall contraction . Because difference cultural background patient train background physician Western Oriental Countries , Western people believe efficacy wide pelvic lymphadenectomy . In Oriental country , due shortage standardize facility , treatment protocol , manpower , concurrent preoperative chemoradiation therapy ( CCRT ) American style currently widely accept . Therefore , advantage disadvantage two treatment modality advance rectal cancer need clarify . In project , plan randomly assign patient two group : ( 1 ) concurrent preoperative chemoradiation therapy ( CCRT ) + conventional surgery group ; ( 2 ) wide pelvic lymphadenectomy group . Thereafter , plan evaluate : ( 1 ) anorectal function anorectal manometry colonic transit time use radioopaque marker ; ( 2 ) micturition function use urodynamic study ; ( 3 ) penile erection RigiScan ; ( 4 ) ejaculatory function clinical interview patient . Moreover , various clinicopathologic factor , include depth tumor invasion status lymph node invasion , record detail accord guideline recommend Japanese Society Coloproctology . Furthermore , evaluate oncological result patient . There 2 characteristic project : ( 1 ) This randomize , prospective study conduct literature ; ( 2 ) The functional evaluation conduct objective way different report series base subjective patient interview . During conduction precious project ( NTU 92-S044 ) , find response rate locally advance rectal cancer CCRT satisfactory . The response rate even increase addition oxaliplatin traditional regimen 5-Fu plus leucovorin . However , significance patient 2 allocated group patient term genitourinary dysfunction . These preliminary data need testified accrual patient long time follow-up . Therefore , mandatory u perform project . We believe study provide new balance point ‘ radical resection ’ ‘ functional preservation ’ advance rectal cancer patient .</detailed_description>
