	<brief_title>Effect Sling Suspension Exercises Proprioception Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapeutic exercise important patient knee osteoarthritis . Few study report effect therapeutic exercise proprioception patient . The purpose study investigate train-ing effect sling suspension exercise , proprioception-training tool , patient knee osteoarthritis , build model proprioception training . Twelve subject recruit study . The inclusion criterion age 50 70 , gender , diagnose knee osteoarthritis , grade 2 3 Kellgren ’ scale . After consent subject receive baseline measurement include active joint reposition test , functional ambulate test self-evaluating Western Ontario &amp; McMaster Universities Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) . Then randomly assign train group reference group . Seven subject train group receive treatment heat , interferential current ( IFC ) , sling suspension exercise sling suspension exercise . Five subject reference group receive treatment heat IFC intervention . The training session sling suspension exercise 3 time per week , last for8 week . After 8-week training , group give post-test completely pre-test . Mann-Whitney U Test use test difference group , Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test use test pre-post difference group . The result show difference group measurement pre-test . After 8 week , show significant difference joint reposi-tion test ( p &lt; .05 ) difference functional ambulate test WOMAC index ( p &gt; .05 ) 2 group . In train group , mea-surements get significant improvement ( p &lt; .05 ) except one functional ambulating test . However , reference group show significant improvement pain physical function subscales WOMAC ( p &lt; .05 ) . This study conclude sling suspension exercise design patient knee osteoarthritis improve proprioception knee joint . The con-tent concept sling suspension exercise study might refer-ence proprioception training patient knee osteoarthritis . Increasing case number elongate duration intervention suggest study .</detailed_description>
