	<detailed_description>HPV Cervical Cancers : Human papillomaviruses ( HPV ) small , nonenveloped DNA virus induce epithelial tumor skin mucosa . The majority tumor benign , show limited growth usually regress spontaneously . However , number human papillomaviruses induce tumor may eventually progress carcinoma . The genital HPV type 16 18 , less frequently , type 31 , 33 , 35 , 45 , 51 56 , implicate etiology cervical anogenital cancer . Approximately 500,000 woman worldwide develop cervical cancer yearly second lead cause death cancer woman . In developed country , cancer cervix rank behind cancer breast , lung , uterus , ovaries account 7 % female cancer . In United States , 4,800 death annually cervical cancer . The evidence link HPVs anogenital cancer come epidemiologic laboratory study . More 90 % cervical cancer precursor , so-called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) , contain human papillomavirus ( HPV ) DNA sequence . The HPV type find cancer cell transform activity vitro study viral transform protein , E6 E7 , consistently express cervical cancer cell line HPV-associated cancer patient . In HPV-associated malignant transformation , viral DNA may integrate cellular DNA integration often result deletion large sector viral genome . Late gene ( L1 L2 ) early gene ( E1 E2 ) usually lose , leave E6 E7 open reading frame frequently find carcinoma . Expression E6 E7 likely overcome regulation cell proliferation normally mediate protein like p53 Rb , allow uncontrolled growth provide potential malignant transformation . HPV Oncogenic Proteins , E6 E7 , Ideal Targets Development Antigen-Specific Immunotherapies Vaccines HPV-Associated Cervical Malignancies : E6 E7 represent ideal target development antigen-specific immunotherapy vaccine HPV-associated malignancy . First , 90 % cervical cancer associate HPVs , particularly type 16 , E6 E7 consistently express cervical cancer . Second , tumor specific antigens derive normal protein mutate protein , E6 E7 completely foreign viral protein , potentially may harbor antigenic peptides/epitopes mutant protein ( i.e . p53 ) reactivate embryonic protein ( i.e . MAGE-1 ) . Third , since E6 E7 require induction maintenance malignant phenotype cancer cell , cell cervical cancer evade immune response antigen loss . Without functional E6 E7 , cell would cease tumorigenic . Therefore , E6 E7 proteins represent ideal target develop antigen-specific immunotherapy vaccine cervical cancer . Various form vaccine , vector-based vaccine , tumor-based vaccine , DNA base vaccine protein/peptide-based vaccine describe experimental system target HPV-16 E6 and/or E7 protein . For example , Meneguzzi et al . report inoculation rat vaccinia recombinant express HPV-16 E6 E7 retard prevented tumor development 25-47 % rat challenge tumorigenic rat cell line co-transfected HPV-16 activate ra . In addition , Chen et al . demonstrate immunization mouse syngeneic non-tumorigenic cell transfected HPV-16 E7 gene confers protection transplant HPV-16 E7 positive syngeneic tumor cell . Feltkamp et al . identify CTL epitope HPV-16 E7 use H-2Kb H-2Db MHC class I-peptide-binding study . Immunization peptide render mouse resistant challenge HPV-16 transform tumor cell . Furthermore , chimeric papillomavirus-like particle ( CVLPs ) consist HPV-16 L1-E7 ( Nieland et al. , personal communication ) HPV-16 L1/L2-E7 ( Greenstone et al. , personal communication ) chimeric protein use therapeutic vaccine HPV-16 E7 express tumor murine model . More recently , phase I/II clinical trial perform eight patient late stage cervical cancer use live recombinant vaccinia virus express E6 E7 proteins HPV 16 18 ( TA-HPV ) . In study , significant clinical side-effects environmental contamination live TA-HPV observe . Importance Cell Mediated Immune Responses Controlling HPV Infections HPV-Associated Neoplasms : Several line evidence suggest cell mediate immune response important control HPV infection HPV-associated neoplasm . First , prevalence HPV-related disease ( infection neoplasms ) increase transplant recipient human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infect patient , know impaired cell mediate immunity . Second , animal study demonstrate immunized animal protect papillomavirus infection development neoplasia . Immunization also facilitate regression exist lesion . Third , infiltrate CD4+ ( T helper cell ) CD8+ ( cytotoxic/suppressor T cell ) T cell observe spontaneously regress wart fourth , warts patient immunosuppressive therapy often disappear treatment discontinue . Cellular Immune Responses HPV : The understanding T-cell mediate immunity HPV infection facilitate identification MHC class I class II epitopes HPV protein . Several group attempt map murine human T helper ( Th ) cell epitopes HPV protein . Several group also try map murine well human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) epitopes HPV protein . Kast et al . identify several high affinity bind peptide HPV-16 E6 E7 proteins human HLA-A allele . Furthermore , HPV-specific CTLs recognize HPV E6 E7 proteins demonstrated peripheral blood cervical cancer patient , healthy donor patient CIN lesion [ Nakagawa , 1997 # 562 ] . Furthermore , infiltration cervical cancer tissue HPV-specific CTLs recently describe . Cell-mediated immune response HPV-infected lesion demonstrate vivo skin test , vitro CTL assay vitro lymphoproliferative response . For instance , Hopfl et al . use bacterially-expressed HPV-16 protein skin test patient CIN lesion find specific skin response virion protein L1 E4 protein . In patient CIN lesion , HPV-specific CTLs identify PBMC cervical tissue . The vitro lymphoproliferative response patient CIN lesion actively investigate . For example , de Gruijl et al . report T cell proliferative response HPV-16 E7 oncogenic protein prominent CIN patient persistent HPV infection . However , Kadish et al . report lymphoproliferative response specific HPV-16 E6 E7 peptide appear associated clearance HPV infection regression CIN lesion . Importance Helper T Cell Functions Generating Effective Antitumor Responses : Increasing evidence suggest inadequate antitumor response result failure helper arm immune response . The event lead activation CTL tightly regulate order protect development inappropriate immune responses self antigens exaggerate response foreign antigen . This regulation mediate lymphokine produce CD4+ T helper cell . CD4+ T helper cell critical generation potent antitumor immune response . CD4+ T cell show instrumental generate immune response several solid malignancy murine [ Fearon , 1990 # 833 ; Golumbek , 1991 # 834 ] human population [ Topalian , 1994 # 396 ; Topalian , 1994 # 397 ] . Several mouse tumor transfected syngeneic MHC class II gene become effective vaccine subsequent challenge wild type class II negative tumor [ Ostrand-Rosenberg , 1990 # 177 ; James , 1991 # 272 ; Chen , 1993 # 213 ] In addition , crucial memory cell T cell arm immune system , CD4+ cell may able provide long term immunity specific antigens [ Tew , 1990 # 624 ; Sprent , 1994 # 625 ] . Role Cytokines Cell-Mediated Immunity : Cell mediate immunity regulate cytokine secrete T helper cell . In general , T helper cell classify Th1 and/or Th2 cell base different type cytokine secrete . Th1 cell secrete interleukin ( IL ) 2 interferon gamma ( IFN-gamma ) . Th2 cell produce IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-10 IL-13 . The Th1 lymphocytes important effector cell inflammatory reaction associate vigorous delay-type hypersensitivity low antibody production , occur contact dermatitis viral intracellular bacterial infection ( review , see [ Mosmann , 1989 # 168 ; Romagnani , 1992 # 130 ] ) . The functional phenotype Th2 cell may account persistent production certain antibody isotypes , particularly IgG1 IgE , eosinophilia observed human helminthic infection allergic disorder . Lymphocyte mediate protection viral infection well control tumor think mediate Th1 cytokine response impair Th2 cytokine response . The IL-2 IFN-gamma produce Th1 response likely major component contributes development cell mediate immunity HPV infection HPV-associated neoplasm . Chimeric E7-specific vaccine control HPV16 E7-expressing tumor model . By cooperate Prof. TC Wu Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes , successfully develop several chimeric DNA , RNA , virus-vector vaccine prevent treat HPV16 E7-expressing tumor animal model . We find E7-chimeric DNA vaccine capable prevent treat growth murine model tumor express E7 . These positive result preclinical murine model encourage u focus development cancer vaccine immunotherapy apply vaccine human subject . However , important set various E7-specific immunologic assay human being evaluate effect cancer vaccine immunotherapy future clinical trial . So would like provide proposal address development HPV 16 E7-specific immunologic assay human being . There several aim project : 1. develop utilize assay measure CTLs HPV 16 E7 protein , 2. develop utilize assay measure T helper ( Th ) responses HPV 16 E7 antigen .</detailed_description>
