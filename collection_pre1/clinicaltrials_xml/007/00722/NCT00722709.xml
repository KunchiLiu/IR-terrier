	<detailed_description>Scientific Background : Postoperative fatigue ( POF ) common phenomenon follow abdominal surgery currently investigation department surgery , Middlemore hospital , Auckland . POF patient undergo major abdominal procedure common . It report 92 % patient undergone abdominal surgery report increase fatigue report immediately procedure , drop 10 % 3 month . POF comprise unpleasant symptom impact patient 's quality life . 1 . It create difficulty perform activity daily live . 2 . The symptom POF include tiredness , lack energy sense debilitate muscle weakness . 3 . POF think associate poor physical , psychological functional outcome . 4 . The aetiology POF think multi-factorial . Biological , psychological social factor contribute . The biological aspect POF divide physiological stress response trauma surgery , postoperative nutritional deficit loss previous cardiovascular fitness subsequently surgery . Various method investigate last two decade address `` dampen '' physiological response order enhance postoperative recovery . There two possible way communication periphery brain . One hormonal route neural route . The late route project via paracrine action local cytokine afferent nerve ending 5 . In abdominal cavity , two type afferent ending 6 . These vagal afferent spinal afferent . Vagal spinal afferent fibre transmit sensory information GI tract CNS . Afferents vagus nerve conduct neuronal message intra-peritoneal cavity CNS . Vagal afferent cell body nodose ganglia enter via brainstem . In comparison cell body spinal afferent locate dorsal root ganglion project dorsal horn cord . They follow path sympathetic parasympathetic efferent gut wall . Vagal afferent either intramuscular intraganglionic . Spinal afferent hand locate serosa , mesenteric attachment submucosa tract . The surgical stress response produce alteration haemodynamic , metabolic immune response patient 7 . The biochemical cytokine response surgical trauma well understood summarise well Ni Choileain . There elements immune stimulation result cascade cytokine activation follow surgery . These cytokine include tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) interleukin 1B ( IL-1B ) . These stimulate production release cytokine include interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) . IL-6 result production C-reactive protein ( CRP ) acute phase proteins hepatic component response . Therapeutic strategy aim restore physiological imbalance associate surgery . In rat sub diaphragmatic vagotomy prevent effect intraperitoneal IL-1 administration prevent increase body temperature increase secrete hypothalamic norepinephrine ( NE ) , markedly attenuate increase plasma ACTH corticosterone 8 . This thought reduce `` sickness response '' intraperitoneal cytokine administration . Similarly , administration localise partial body exposure irradiation vagotomised rat result decreased hypothalamic , thalamic , hippocampal cortical IL-6 , IL-1b TNF-a compare non-vagotomised rat 9 . It therefore think vagus play major role surgical stress response although important point vagus think solely responsible activation hypothalamic activity 10 . A pro-inflammatory cytokine pathway abdominal surgery , direct action cytokine vagus nerve major vehicle response , therefore , feasible explanation contribute POF . In clinical context , recent development elective large bowel surgery include use Fast Track ( FT ) Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) protocols . The use protocols generally say affect metabolic , neural organ activity order reduce morbidity , increase recovery time result short hospital stay . There numerous element protocol , give multiple contributor POF , already discuss . In brief , intervention include extensive preoperative counseling preparation psychologically , preoperative fasting , carbohydrate loading , use epidural anaesthesia , avoidance peri-operative fluid load , early removal catheter , drain early mobilisation physiotherapist . 11 . Other intervention , pre-operative steroid administration , currently trialed part ERAS surgical protocol Manukau Surgery Centre ( MSC ) , Middlemore Hospital , Auckland . The purpose enhance recovery decrease cascade pro-inflammatory post surgical response use immunosuppressive property agent . As discuss earlier , pro-inflammatory response hypothesise contribute POF . Local anaesthetic ( LA ) agent , apply sufficient concentration site action , prevent conduction electrical impulse membrane nerve muscle12 . In order obtain clear picture fundamental blocking mechanism , knowledge channel-binding kinetics drug necessary . The application LA agent intraperitoneal cavity investigate several trial decrease post operative pain enhance recovery 13-18 . Unfortunately study look application local anaesthesia open procedure compare laparoscopic gastrointestinal procedure . It therefore area trial need . It unreasonable application local anaesthesia intraperitoneal cavity play role ERAS protocol . In order reduce postoperative pain reduce intra-abdominal CNS signal transmission produce transient `` chemical affarenectomy '' . As part already establish ERAS protocol Manukau Surgical Centre ( MSC ) , aim look effect instillation local anaesthesia intra-peritoneal cavity immediately open abdominal cavity propose ongoing LA infusion intraperitoneal catheter external pump postoperatively . Objectives : 1 . To involved run already establish ERAS program Manukau Surgical Centre ( MSC ) . 2 . Conduct randomise double blind control trial investigate effect intra-peritoneal local anaesthesia application postoperative pain POF patient ERAS protocol . Methods Outcomes : There already establish ERAS perioperative care plan MSC . Patients usually recruit surgical outpatient clinic Manukau Super Clinic . Patients undergoing colonic operation recruit ERAS program supervision primary consultant colorectal surgeon . My aim involve data gather clinical aspect maintain protocol . Summary ERAS perioperative care plan MSC conduct Zargar et al . ( Table 1 ) - Pre-Operative Information counsel - Carbohydrate Loading - Avoidance Mechanical Bowel Preparation - Continuous Bupivacaine thoracic epidural analgesia - Limited IV fluid therapy ( ERAS anaesthetic protocol ) - Avoidance prophylactic nasogastric tube - Early Post operative oral intake - Dietary Supplementation - Avoidance opioids - Early mobilisation accord mobilisation protocol - Discharge Criteria Research Design : Randomised double blinded clinical trial investigate effect wash infuse intraperitoneal cavity local anaesthesia postoperative pain fatigue score patient undergo open colonic procedure . Ethics : Ethics approval project obtain . Sample size : Using data previous study measure post-operative fatigue follow colonic surgery , order detect reduction post-operative fatigue 30 % day 7 post-operatively alpha 0.05 power 0.8 , 21 patient require group , aim 30 patient arm anticipate possible drop out . Brief Method : Patients randomise computer generate random number opaque envelope method . In treatment arm patient receive 10mls 0.75 % ropivacaine dilute 50mls 0.9 % saline soon creation laparotomy placebo arm , receive 50mls 0.9 % normal saline similar fashion . One theatre staff nurse involved patient care give blind envelop prepare lidocaine saline mixture theatre drug room . The mixture unlabelled appear similar color . These give surgeon procedure . All member staff involve patient care include anaesthetist blind solution administer . The theatre staff nurse prepare small infusion pump . The mixture use pump pre-mixed one clinical pharmacist Middlemore hospital involve patient care . The staff nurse un-blinded content mixture . The nurse prepare pump load either anaesthetic saline solution . At closure , two small 2mm catheter place peritoneal cavity site operation infuse local anaesthetic . This penetrate skin closure complete . This attach small infusion pump ( On-Q pain buster ) . This pump contain either 270mls 0.2 % ropivacaine 270mls 0.9 % saline . All member involve patient care include surgical , anaesthetic nursing team blind content pump . The pump activate set rate 4mls/hr immediately patient post anaesthesia recovery room . The pump run continuously . The patient continue recovery ward per ERAS protocol . After 68 hrs pump stop catheter remove similar fashion routine drain removal . Endpoints : - Assessment postoperative pain use Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 1 hour , 2 hour , 4 hour , 6 hour , 8 hour , day 1 , day 2 day 3 post operatively . - Forced expiratory volume use peak flow meter immediately pre-operatively anaesthesia room 1 hour , 2 hour , 4 hour , 8 hour , day 1 , day 2 day 3 postoperatively ( best 3 attempt measurement use ) - Fatigue assessment do use Identity Consequence Fatigue Scale ( ICFS ) pre-operatively day 1 , 2 3 , 7 , 30 60 postoperatively respectively . - Serum Glucose , cytokines local anaesthetic level 8 , 20 , 48 , 72 hour post op . - CRP , Albumin 20 , 48 72 hour post op .
