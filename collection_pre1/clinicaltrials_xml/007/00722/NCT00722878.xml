	<brief_summary>Primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) , also know Kartagener syndrome , genetic disorder cilium , microscopic hair-like cell . Cilia work keep respiratory system clean move mucus contains debris large airway , cough . People PCD cilia move properly therefore effective clean respiratory system . This study determine PCD start change time , specifically term well lung work , germ grow lung secretion , lung look compute tomography ( CT ) scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PCD , Kartagener syndrome , genetic disorder cause hair-like cell call cilium move improperly , case , . Cilia need help clear respiratory system pollutant . When work properly , move debris-filled mucus large airway , allow debris cough body . When cilia work properly , body rid debris leave vulnerable serious infection sinus , ear , lung . Over time , repeat infection lead scar permanent obstruction body area . This study determine PCD start change time , specifically term well lung work , germ grow lung secretion , lung look CT scan . This research may lead good understand PCD thereby help doctor improve clinical management disease . Children study attend six study visit 5 year . At first visit , parent review child 's medical cough history doctor . Also visit , child undergo physical exam include measure temperature , blood pressure , heart rate , respiration rate , oxygen saturation level . Additional procedure include collection respiratory mucus sample throat culture , measurement nasal nitric oxide , collection blood urine specimen banking , CT scan , lung function test . Children young 3 year age undergo scan lung function test sedation . Children old 3 year age receive sedation . CT scan perform initial visit visit 3 5 child old 3 . For child young 3 year , chest CT scan perform initial visit visit 4 6 . Lung function test blood urine collection may repeat remain yearly visit . Between yearly visit , parent track calendar child 's use oral , inhaled , intravenous antibiotic .</detailed_description>
