	<brief_summary>Aortic coarctation relatively common cardiovascular condition high associate mortality treat . Even successful repair , however , close follow need late complication result significant cardiovascular morbidity . MRI , ability provide anatomic hemodynamic information , become image option choice post-intervention surveillance . Time-resolved , three-dimensional phase contrast magnetic resonance velocity ( 4D Flow ) profile enables acquisition multidirectional blood velocity data . The technique well suited evaluation blood flow pattern thoracic aorta . By compare aortic flow pattern patient status post coarctation repair healthy volunteer use 4D Flow , study intend characterize abnormal flow pattern patient eventual goal well understanding predict late complication preemptive intervention may take . Given potential use 4D Flow evaluation type vascular pathology aorta vascular region , hope investigate use technique limited basis broad population adult patient . Other research group success evaluate peripheral stenosis , well intracardiac intracranial blood flow pattern 4D Flow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients : primarily status post intervention repair aortic coarctation undergo routine MRI follow , also adult patient vascular pathology undergo routine MRI evaluation , may good candidate 4D Flow blood flow analysis .
