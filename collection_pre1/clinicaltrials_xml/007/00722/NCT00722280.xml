	<brief_summary>Overall Goal To establish hand transplantation safe effective reconstructive strategy treatment upper extremity amputation . Specific Aim To reduce risk rejection enable allograft survival minimize requirement long term high dose immunosuppression . For purpose , propose utilize `` Pittsburgh Protocol '' , immunomodulatory strategy implement solid organ transplant UPMC . Early result live related liver kidney patient confirm protocol provide mean allow graft survival minimization maintenance immunosuppression even allow wean patient long-term immunosuppression.We hypothesize similar protocol enable graft survival highly immunogenic composite tissue allograft like hand transplant reduce number , dose and/or frequency immunosuppressive drug associate serious adverse effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Suitable candidate identify via patient information brochure via advertisement direct upper limb amputee . For purpose , web-page construct free access interested individual . This website accessible standard search engine . Interested potential subject instruct contact investigator appointment . At time appointment , candidate first request complete screen consent form ( SCF ) undergo evaluation/medical screening procedure . The SCF include write consent obtain PHI candidate . When candidate visit UPMC undergo consultation PI perform thorough clinical assessment explain detail treatment option , risk benefit procedure . Candidates request complete screen consent stage . Appropriate subject undergo medical screening procedure include number examination investigation determine candidacy hand transplantation . Prospective recipient select base result screen procedure invite review sign full informed consent form prior wait-listed procedure . The screening test include : History physical exam , include height weight Urine pregnancy test female subject childbearing potential Complete blood count , differential , reticulocyte count , platelet count ABO type Liver function test include SGPT SGOT , serum bilirubin ( total direct ) , total protein , albumin , alkaline phosphatase GGT , PT , PTT INR Serum electrolytes renal function panel include follow : sodium , potassium , chloride , carbon dioxide , calcium , phosphorus , magnesium , glucose , creatinine BUN Urinalysis creatinine clearance test determine GFR Infectious disease study : HIV antigen , HTLV I-II antibody , antibody HIV 1 2 , hepatitis C virus , syphilis , hepatitis B core antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen titer require Infectious disease titer : CMV , EBV , HSV , toxoplasmosis VZV ( IgG IgM indicate ) Pulmonary function test , include DLCO2 Chest X-ray EKG MUGA scan echocardiogram determination cardiac ejection fraction Sinus X-ray ( clinically indicate ) CT scan ( CT Angiography ) /MRI study ( Functional MRI , Skeletal MRIs hand/hips ) indicate medical history physical examination Ophthalmologic examination Dental consult Psychiatric evaluation</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Donor Selection Criteria Brain dead donor meet criterion Determination Death select hand transplant team conjunction CORE ( Center Organ Recovery Education ) , organ procurement agency ( OPO ) Pittsburgh cover Pennsylvania , New York West Virginia . The mandatory requirement family consent limb donation , stable donor ( require excessive vasopressor maintain blood pressure ) , age 18 55 year , limb match size recipient , blood type recipient , negative crossmatch , importantly accurately matched gender , skin tone race ( may relative requirement depend recipient consent ) . Recipient Selection Criteria Recipients select population subject upper limb loss . Recipients may male female race , color ethnicity . 1 . Age ( &gt; 18 year &lt; 60 year ) : Recipients &lt; 18 year age exclude due limitation give full inform consent potentially increase risk lymphoproliferative disorder young population . Once hand transplantation particular strategy minimize immunosuppression proven efficacious safe , restriction regard recipient age may relax . 2 . No serious coexist medical ( coronary artery disease , diabetes ) psychosocial problem ( include alcoholism , drug abuse ) . 3 . Must negative malignancy ( 10 year ) HIV ( transplant ) . 4 . Negative crossmatch donor . 5 . Negative pregnancy test female recipient child bear potential consent use reliable contraception least one year follow transplantation . 6 . Consent cell collection , storage , bone marrow infusion part treatment regime . 7 . Amputation may recent ( acute injury ) remote ( patient may undergo rehabilitation prosthesis ) . 1 . Conditions may impact immunomodulatory protocol : These include disease like HIV malignancy could expose recipient unacceptable risk immunosuppressive treatment . Sensitized recipient high level preform antibody also risk . 2 . Conditions may impact success surgical procedure increase risk postoperative complication : These include inherited coagulopathies like Hemophilia , VonWillebrand 's disease , Protein C S deficiency , Thrombocythemias , Thallassemias , Sickle Cell disease etc . Mixed connective tissue disease collagen disease result poor wound heal surgery , 3 . Conditions may impact functional outcome : Lipopolysaccharidoses amyloidosis condition may impact nerve regeneration impair outcome . Also , rare disorder bone heal like osteopetrosis may also cause exclusion .</criteria>
