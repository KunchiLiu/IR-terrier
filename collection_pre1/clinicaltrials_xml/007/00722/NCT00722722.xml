	<brief_summary>Patients plan kidney transplantation sensitize donor high level donor specific alloantibody . High level donor specific antibody put kidney transplant recipient risk rejection early transplant . This study try determine drug bortezomib ( Velcade ™ ) reduce donor specific alloantibody level permit kidney transplantation without high risk rejection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Velcade ( TM ) Antibody Secreting Cells Sensitized Renal Allograft Candidates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design assess impact vivo treatment bortezomib anti-human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) production normal antibody secrete cell ( ASC ) sensitize renal allograft candidate . The design involve treatment subject bortezomib use one three dose regimen ( 4 dos , 16 dos 32 dos bortezomib ) . Using novel assay , anti-HLA production determine measure bone marrow derive ASC baseline ( prior therapy ) treatment ( day 14 , 3 day last bortezomib dose ) . Paired data use patient serve control . Finally , safety bortezomib evaluate monitoring total serum antibody level incidence side effect ( primarily neuropathy ) 1 month , final follow-up point .</detailed_description>
