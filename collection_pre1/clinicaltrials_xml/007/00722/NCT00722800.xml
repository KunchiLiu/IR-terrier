	<brief_summary>The purpose study find take birth control pill , YAZ , safe effective treat hidradenitis suppurativa . Hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS ) chronic ( long lasting ) skin disorder mostly affect armpit groin area . It appear blackheads one red , tender bump may enlarge , break open , drain pu . Scarring may result several attack disease . The exact cause HS n't know . However , believe plug hair follicle bacterial infection occur acne also occur HS . Many medication use treat acne also use HS . However , none medication consistently effective . YAZ combination birth control pill . Nearly birth control pill make combination estrogen progestin hormone . YAZ contain ethinyl estradiol ( estrogen ) drospirenone ( progestin ) . People develop acne sebaceous gland over-stimulated male sex hormone ( androgen ) . Sebaceous gland secrete oily substance hair follicle lubricate hair skin . The progestin YAZ actually block male sex hormone ( androgen ) cause acne . Hormones seem play role HS condition occur puberty . It affect woman men HS often get bad around time woman menstrual period . YAZ approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat moderate acne woman desire oral contraceptive birth control . This study use placebo . A placebo look like study drug contains active drug . We use placebos research study learn effect see research subject truly study drug reason .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Examine Safety Efficacy Drospirenone Ethinyl Estradiol ( YAZ ) Versus Placebo In HS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hidradenitis suppurativa chronic suppurative scar disease primarily affect axillae inguinal perineal area . The apocrine gland primary target . It characterize firm , tender red nodule soon become fluctuant painful . Rupture lesion , suppuration , formation sinus tract scar may occur . The exact etiology HS remain obscure . Proposed etiologic factor include follicular occlusion bacterial infection , genetics , host defense defect , hormone , cigarette smoking , irritant . Hormones seem play role , condition occur puberty , affect woman men , often flare perimenstrual period . Treating hidradenitis remain challenge . Although many patient benefit long-term treatment systemic antibiotic ( eg , tetracycline , minocycline , clindamycin , erythromycin combination metronidazole ) , publish evidence suggest long-term use antibiotic alters natural course HS . Oral isotretinoin use , effective case . Some patient beneficial response biological agent , especially anti-TNF alpha biologicals infliximab . Oral contraceptive contain norgestrel cyproterone acetate , alone combination supplemental cyproterone acetate , spironolactone dexamethasone ( block adrenal androgen production ) , show reduce frequency severity attack woman . YAZ oral contraceptive FDA approve acne vulgaris . Unlike progestin , drospirenone unique antimineralocorticoid ( mild diuretic effect ) antiandrogenic property . The antiandrogenic property drospirenone mean block male sex hormone cause acne . It hop YAZ offer patient hidradenitis suppurativa safe effective therapeutic option . Subjects assign treatment group upon randomization . Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals personnel , investigator , subject study nurse/coordinators blind study product treatment assignment . The study duration 24 week visit screen , baseline ( week 0 ) , week 6 , week 12 , week 18 , week 24 . Lesion count ( total , inflammatory , non-inflammatory ) ISGA , photography perform every visit . A physical examination do baseline Week 24 . Safety assess reported adverse event ( AEs ) .</detailed_description>
