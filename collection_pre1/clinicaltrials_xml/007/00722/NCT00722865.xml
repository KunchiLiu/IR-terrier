	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine effectiveness safety Avastin combine standard chemotherapy Hodgkin lymphoma . Avastin work differently standard chemotherapy drug . It type protein call antibody bind substance call VEGF ( Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ) . VEGF stimulate growth blood vessel fee tumor encourage tumor cell growth . VEGF produce excess Hodgkin lymphoma cell , associate poor outcome patient Hodgkin lymphoma . When activity VEGF interrupt multiple cancer type , blood vessel around tumor cell die result less nutrient delivery death tumor . Blocking VEGF also show improve delivery chemotherapy cancer cell , make standard chemotherapy work well . This trial use Avastin combination standard chemotherapy goal improve cure rate chemotherapy alone .</brief_summary>
