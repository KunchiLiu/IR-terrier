	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether pralatrexate , give vitamin B12 folic acid , effective treatment advance metastatic bladder cancer . The study also investigate safety pralatrexate vitamin B12 folic acid patient population . Additionally , study include collection blood sample investigate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pralatrexate patient population ( PK activity drug body period time , include drug absorb , distribute body , localized tissue , excrete body ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm transitional cell carcinoma urinary bladder . Fine needle aspirate accept . Relapsed progressed treatment platinum and/or methotrexatebased systemic chemotherapy regimen . No 1 prior regimen permit recurrent/metastatic disease . Patients chemotherapyfree interval ≥ 12 month last dose recent prior chemotherapy neoadjuvant/adjuvant set ≥ 6month chemotherapyfree interval recurrent/metastatic setting . Patient recover toxic effect prior therapy . Previous intravesical therapy allow . Prior surgical resection allow , long patient recover . Measurable disease outside previously irradiate region , per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . At least 18 year age . Adequate blood , liver , kidney function define laboratory result . Patient receive 1.01.25 mg oral folic acid daily least 7 day enrollment &amp; 1 mg intramuscular vitamin B12 within 10 week enrollment . Women childbearing potential negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior enrollment agree use medically acceptable effective birth control enrollment least 30 day last dose pralatrexate . Men surgically sterile whose partner childbearing potential must use medically safe effective birth control start pralatrexate least 90 day last dose pralatrexate . Accessible repeat dose follow . Give write informed consent . Active concurrent primary malignancy prior malignancy occur within 5 year ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ carcinoma cervix , occult , indolent carcinoma prostate ) . If history prior malignancy exception list , patient must disease free ≥ 5 year . Patients prior malignancy &lt; 5 year study entry may still enrol receive treatment result complete resolution cancer currently clinical , radiologic , laboratory evidence active recurrent disease . In case single extrapelvic metastatic site , irrespective patient history previous malignancy , biopsy proof metastatic diseased organ necessary . More 1 previous regimen recurrent/metastatic disease . Evidence clinically significant active thirdspace phenomenon Use investigational drug , biologics , device within 28 day prior study enrollment . Previous exposure antifolates , include pralatrexate . Previous methotrexate allow , part MVAC MCV regimen . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Congestive Heart Failure Class III/IV accord New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Functional Classification . Uncontrolled hypertension . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive diagnosis CD4 count &lt; 100 mm3 detectable viral load within past 3 month , receive combination antiretroviral therapy . Central nervous system metastatic disease . Major surgery within 2 week study enrollment . Radiation therapy ( RT ) within 4 week ( within 3 month RT pelvis ) prior study enrollment . Active infection serious underlie medical condition , would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment . Dementia significantly alter mental status would prohibit understanding give informed consent limit study compliance .</criteria>
