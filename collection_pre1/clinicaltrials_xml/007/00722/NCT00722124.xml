After steady decline last 50 year , prevalence tobacco use United States reach plateau approximately 21 % . Currently available treatment among adult efficacious tobacco user . New pharmacologic agent thus need continually develop test . The release dopamine nucleus accumbens one key component pleasurable reward effect nicotine . Drugs increase monoamine neurotransmitter availability ( particularly dopamine norepinephrine ) likely increase reward function thus ameliorate withdrawal symptom . S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine ( SAMe ) , primary methyl donor central nervous system ( CNS ) , donate methyl group towards presynaptic synthesis CNS monoamine neurotransmitter . By facilitate synthesis dopamine norepinephrine brain , SAMe likely ameliorate symptom nicotine withdrawal , thus improve tobacco abstinence rate smoker try stop smoking . SAMe well tolerate available over-the-counter . To date , prospective clinical trial evaluate efficacy SAMe treatment tobacco dependence publish . We propose evaluate efficacy SAMe increase smoke abstinence decrease nicotine withdrawal symptom randomize , blind , placebo-controlled , three-arm , parallel-group , dose-ranging phase II clinical trial . Participants ( N=120 ) randomly assign one three group , receive 8-week course SAMe 800-mg per day , 1600-mg per day , match placebo .
