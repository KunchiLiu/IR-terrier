	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use fulvestrant may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Giving sorafenib together fulvestrant may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give sorafenib together fulvestrant work treat patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer respond aromatase inhibitor therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Fulvestrant Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer That Did Not Respond Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To investigate clinical activity sorafenib tosylate fulvestrant , determine 4-month progression-free survival rate , patient hormone receptor-positive locally advanced metastatic breast cancer progress prior treatment aromatase inhibitor . Secondary - To determine objective response rate patient treat regimen . - To determine median time progression patient treat regimen . - To determine progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - To determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - To establish safety tolerability profile regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-28 . Patients also receive fulvestrant intramuscularly day 1 15 course 1 day 1 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28-56 day .</detailed_description>
