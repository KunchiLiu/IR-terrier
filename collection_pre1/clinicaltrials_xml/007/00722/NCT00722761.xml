	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Of Drospirenone Ethinyl Estradiol v Placebo Treatment Truncal Acne</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acne common skin disease affect 85-100 % population . Although often appear puberty , may persist third decade life even later . It characterize variety lesion consist non-inflammatory lesion know comedo , inflammatory lesion papule , pustule , nodule cyst . It commonly occur face , chest , back . Although noticeable facial acne , truncal acne may also affect person 's self esteem body image reduce one 's participation sport need undress share locker room . Most acne study focus facial acne ignore treatment outcomes chest back . The pathogenesis acne multifactorial , develop sebaceous gland . These factor include intrafollicular hypercornification , induce follicular obstruction result comedone formation , excess sebum production , Propionibacterium acnes activity inflammation . Hormone therapy , oral contraceptive antiandrogens ( e.g . spironolactone ) counteract effect androgens sebaceous gland . It ten year since estrogen-containing oral contraceptive ( OCs ) first obtain FDA approval use acne . Since , several randomize control trial corroborate efficacy safety grow indication woman child bear age . Studies show hormonal therapy effective treat moderate acne vulgaris woman know contraindication OC therapy . YAZ oral contraceptive FDA approve acne vulgaris . Unlike progestin , drospirenone unique antimineralocorticoid ( mild diuretic effect ) antiandrogenic property . The antiandrogenic property drospirenone mean block male sex hormone cause acne . In two multicenter , double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study , 889 subject , age 14 45 year , moderate acne receive YAZ placebo six 28 day cycle . The primary efficacy endpoint percent change inflammatory lesion , non-inflammatory lesion , total lesion , percentage subject `` clear '' `` almost clear '' rating Investigator 's Static Global Assessment ( ISGA ) scale day 15 cycle 6 . Subjects assign treatment group upon randomization . Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals personnel , investigator , subject study nurse/coordinators blind study product treatment assignment . The study duration 24 week visit screen , baseline ( week 0 ) , week 6 , week 12 , week 18 , week 24 . Lesion count ( total , inflammatory , non-inflammatory ) ISGA , photography perform every visit . A physical examination do baseline Week 24 . Safety assess reported adverse event ( AEs ) .</detailed_description>
