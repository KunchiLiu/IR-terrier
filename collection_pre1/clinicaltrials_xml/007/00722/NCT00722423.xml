	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized control trial compare two different clinic model patient hepatitis C. These patient commonly mental health problem barrier receive HCV treatment . Patients give informed consent randomize usual care HCV clinic vs. HCV clinic addition on-site mental health practitioner address psychiatric substance use issue goal enable patient undergo effective antiviral therapy . The major outcome study number patient group `` cure '' antiviral therapy . Patients group receive current standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Integrated Care Model Improving Hepatitis C Virus Patient Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Impact Veterans : Treatments available often eliminate hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infect veteran , result increased life expectancy quality life . However , many veteran get treat fail treatment variety factor . Using new protocol-based model care center around integrate psychiatric care case management VA HCV clinic , may possible increase treatment rate , improve rate sustain viral response ( SVR ) , improve health outcome veterans hepatitis C. Background : The prevalence hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection among VA patient 3x high general population . VA patient HCV characteristic link increase risk progression cirrhosis , male sex , high body mass index , tobacco marijuana use , history heavy alcohol use . Antiviral treatment evidence-based treatment show eradicate HCV virus reduce progression liver fibrosis . However , recent VA data indicate 14 % HCV-infected VA patient ever receive antiviral therapy . Barriers receive antiviral treatment include factor pre-existing psychiatric illness , ongoing substance abuse , medical co-morbidity . Patients psychiatric substance use history benefit integrated care approach HCV care , rigorous study design require demonstrate effectiveness . Primary Objective : To determine effectiveness protocol-based integrate care model increase treatment rate number patient successful antiviral treatment measure increase percentage new HCV patient achieve sustained virologic response ( SVR ) . We hypothesize model increase proportion patient fully evaluate treatment , initiate treatment , complete treatment compare patient receive usual care . Secondary Objectives : Assess effect integrate care model patient involvement care ( appointment attendance ) PROs ( substance abuse , depression , anxiety ) . We hypothesize veteran manage integrate care model well attendance HCV clinic appointment , improve rate drug alcohol abstinence , few psychological symptom . Project Methods : The intervention integrate clinical care model develop initially study Minneapolis VA HCV Clinic . The preliminary study find integrate care result high treatment rate , high SVRs , reduce substance use , improved psychological functioning . Thus , use rigorous randomize design study effectiveness intervention 3 major VA medical center . All clinic patient screen depression , anxiety , PTSD , recent SUDs patient screen positive 1 measure ask participate . Preliminary data suggest 85 % HCV clinic patient screen positive least one measure . Eligible patient randomize either usual integrate care site . The integrate care intervention follow manualized protocol consist series brief intervention tailor patient ' main barrier treatment along case management approach integrate care mental health provider actively track patient progress evaluation treatment process . The integrate care mental health provider clinical nurse specialist , psychologist , license clinical social worker experience training provision psychiatric SUD intervention . They receive additional training integrate care protocol . Data collect baseline , pre-treatment , post-treatment interval . Clinical data obtain VA medical record study coordinator site . PROs assess use validated measure . Data analyze use hierarchical linear modeling ( HLM ) technique .</detailed_description>
