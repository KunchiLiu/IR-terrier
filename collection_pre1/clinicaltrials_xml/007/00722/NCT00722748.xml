	<detailed_description>The completion human genome project within final month previous millennium , landmark scientific accomplishment . This achievement herald importance human molecular genetics play come century medicine . In short , one expect dissect phenotypic aspect disease culprit mutation/variation gene collection gene , modify augment present diagnostic ability lead new therapeutic intervention target base discovery . The broad application human genetics progress study rare mendelian trait complete penetrance compile last 3-4 decade large number `` common '' diseases multi-gene etiology variable penetrance non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus hypertension . Cardiology probably stay forefront transformation , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain major source morbidity mortality develop country , fast reach status underdeveloped country . Furthermore , track record rapid adaptation new technology research field cardiology , would give impetus transition . In midst dynamic current , proposal put forward research plan initiate genetic databank , henceforth refer The Genebank Scripps Clinic Registry . This database usher genomic research Scripps strive stay forefront cardiovascular research new century . The objective study , obtain blood sample order define gene various cardiovascular condition . The blood sample go DNA analysis note 1 million SNP 's per individual .</detailed_description>
