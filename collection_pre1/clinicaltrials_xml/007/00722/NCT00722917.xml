	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety TAK-379 Adult Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes metabolic disease reach epidemic proportion . The global incidence disease estimate increase 120 million individual 200 million year 2010 . In type 2 diabetes , multiple metabolic defect contribute hyperglycemia . These include insulin resistance , inadequate insulin secretion , excessive hepatic glucose production . Nine class antihyperglycemic agent currently approve treatment type 2 diabetes ( insulin , sulfonylurea , biguanides , alpha-glycosidase inhibitor , thiazolidinediones , glinides , glucagon-like peptide analogue , amylin analogue , dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor ) . Each class act unique mechanism 1 metabolic defect . Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited develop TAK-379 , non-thiazolidinedione partial proliferator-activated receptor agonist treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus . Study participation anticipate approximately 4.5 month .</detailed_description>
