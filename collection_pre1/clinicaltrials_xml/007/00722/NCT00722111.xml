	<brief_title>Exercise Swallowing Problems After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Swallowing problem affect many 40 % adult age 60 . Serious consequence suffer numerous patient neuromuscular deficit secondary stroke . Patients dysphagia subsequent stroke face risk death pneumonia , perhaps serious sequela dysphagia , malnutrition dehydration also dire secondary consequence . If stroke patient survive , require long hospital stay nurse home placement diminish rehabilitation potential . Despite devastate influence dysphagia secondary stroke health , evidence support effect specific intervention swallow outcome population sparse . Neural plasticity mechanism damage brain relearns `` lose behavior '' response rehabilitation . A goal proposal implement several principle exercise neural plasticity ( specificity , repetition , intensity ) clinically justifiable manner may use guide clinical research ultimately practice . To end , determine neuromuscular change affect swallow outcome response 3 unique 8-week exercise intervention compare sham hand ( control ) exercise group . The main hypothesis 8 week intense progressive rehabilitation exercise feedback - either lingual press ( high-intensity , oral , non-swallowing ) effortful swallowing ( high-intensity swallowing ) - stroke patient dysphagia show swallow improvement ( define improve score Penetration/Aspiration Scale and/or Residue Scale absence worsen average score ) great extent subject perform natural swallowing ( low-intensity swallowing ) exercise sham ( control ) exercise group . This hypothesis test 3 discrete objective : Objective 1 : Compare outcomes four different 8-week exercise intervention among dysphagic stroke patient ; Objective 2 : Characterize bolus flow , swallow biomechanics , lingual anatomy swallow function stroke patient initial calculation multi-dimensional swallowing profile pre-intervention comparison profile post-intervention ; Objective 3 : Determine appropriate dose treatment 4 8 week study subject . We randomize 200 men woman post-stroke 4 treatment group ( 50 subject per group ) . Subjects randomized one four group , identify treatment outcome . The exercise intervention include ( ) lingual press ( high-intensity , oral , non-swallowing ) ( b ) effortful swallow ( high-intensity swallowing ) ; ( c ) natural swallowing ( low intensity swallowing ) , compare ( ) non-oral sham ( control ) exercise . All exercise involve 2 set 10 repetition perform 3 time day 3 non-consecutive day per week . For Objectives 1 2 baseline , week 4 , week 8 , subject complete simultaneous videofluoroscopic lingual pressure measure calculate measure bolus flow swallowing biomechanics , comprise 1 ) direction ( average Penetration/Aspiration Scale Score ) , completeness ( average Residue Scale Score ) , duration msec ; 2 ) isometric swallow pressure ; 3 ) duration extent hyolaryngeal excursion open upper esophageal sphincter . At 3 timepoints , subject also complete magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure stroke lesion volume , lingual volume , lingual tissue differentiation well complete swallowing-specific quality life dietary questionnaire . For Objective 3 , subject complete measure baseline week 4 8 determine benefit make course exercise . Knowledge dose response allow accurate prescription clinical program . The Dept . Veterans Affairs designate `` age '' impact health high research priority . As age veteran population grows , dysphagia deleterious health consequence include pneumonia and/or malnutrition increase public health burden . In fact , VHA Directive 2006-32 recently issue ( May 17 , 2006 ) define standard procedure assessment treatment patient dysphagia . Appropriate diagnosis treatment dysphagia low-cost , non-invasive efficacious exercise program may reduce health care cost , also lead improvement patient health quality life . For patient post-stroke , implication enormous life-threatening incidence aspiration reduce prevent .</detailed_description>
