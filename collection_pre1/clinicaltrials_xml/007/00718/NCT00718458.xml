	<brief_summary>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) progressive neuromuscular condition characterize weakness , muscle wasting , fasciculation increase reflex . Depending site onset , individual ALS progressively lose control skeletal muscle ; bulbar extremity . As symptom worsen spread , muscle atrophy become apparent upper motor neuron symptom spasticity complicate gait ( low limb involvement ) manual dexterity ( upper limb involvement ) . The patient progress state profound disability great difficulty communicate ; may even entirely `` lock '' body . The capacity simple communication could greatly improve quality life . New technology give people disability alternate communication control option . One instrument EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface ( BCI ) provide communication control function lose muscle control . By record electroencephalographic ( EEG ) signal brain wave scalp decode , Wadsworth BCI allow people make selection computer screen [ ] In study investigate feasibility use EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface technology communication solution individual ALS . The specific question address : Can individual ALS use BCI communication present extreme loss neuromuscular control severe communication impairment ? The goal project determine whether device practical realistic mean individual ALS communicate . The study intend evaluate complexity system degree participant able communicate . Trials consist ask subject follow series simple instruction complete certain task use BCI . This study design require individual live Philadelphia region .
