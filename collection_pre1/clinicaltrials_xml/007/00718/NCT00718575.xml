	<brief_summary>Standard liver retrieval procedure transplantation decease donor inevitably result `` reperfusion injury '' liver tissue . The purpose research study find whether treatment liver `` precondition '' protocol removal donor help reduce injury . The `` preconditioning '' treatment test two component . Firstly , solution glucose+insulin infuse secondly , blood flow liver stop briefly ( 10 minute ) resume . Both strategy , individually , show reduce liver tissue injury human study . We hypothesize combine strategy clinical benefit patient improve liver function follow transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Liver transplantation chance cure patient end-stage liver disease . Unfortunately , standard organ preservation result ischemic-reperfusion injury ( IRI ) time graft implantation . Novel strategy propose decrease reperfusion injury improve graft function . This study first combine strategy randomize , prospective trial . The intervention occur retrieval surgery prior cold preservation . Briefly , glucose insulin solution infuse via mesenteric vein control rate . Immediately prior cross-clamping , blood supply liver restrict 10 minute resume 10 minute begin cold preservation . All remain surgical procedure , include recipient surgery , perform standard technique . The liver recipient directly receive intervention study .</detailed_description>
