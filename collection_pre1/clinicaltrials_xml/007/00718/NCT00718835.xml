	<detailed_description>The prevalence cigarette smoking among patient receive opioid agonist treatment , methadone buprenorphine maintenance , three-fold general population associate increased morbidity mortality . Despite statistic , little know effectively help opioid-maintained patient quit smoke . We believe treatment successfully promote smoke cessation patient would offer exciting potential dissemination . First , treatment modality uniquely situate offer ideal set implement smoking-cessation intervention . Many patient achieve significant period stability drug abstinence remain engaged treatment long periods time , promote frequent prolonged clinical contact enable success smoke cessation . Second , opioid treatment program often adhere uniform set state federal regulation , could support dissemination effective intervention throughout clinic across country . Therefore , overarch goal Behavior Therapy Development project systematically develop voucher-based contingency-management ( CM ) intervention promote initial longer-term abstinence cigarette smoking patient receive methadone buprenorphine treatment opioid abuse . Our first aim develop CM treatment promote initial smoking abstinence patient use intensive brief 2-week intervention ( Study 1 ) . Our second aim integrate procedure establish initial abstinence design maintain abstinence overarch goal promote smoke cessation sustain incentive program discontinue ( Study 2 ) .</detailed_description>
