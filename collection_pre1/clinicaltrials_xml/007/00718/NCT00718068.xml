	<brief_title>Safety Continuous Potassium Chloride Infusion Critical Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use potassium supplementation commonplace critical care environment . Patients often abnormal serum potassium level due active disease process . Conditions acute renal failure metabolic acidosis precipitate hyperkalaemia , ileus insensible loss cause hypokalaemia . Both hypo- hyperkalaemia cause life-threatening arrythmias prudent rectify aberrant level . The standard treatment hypokalaemia intensive care unit intravenous administration potassium chloride . This give either dilute solution maintenance intravenous fluid therapy , concentrated solution intermittent infusion . Alternatively potassium give concentrated solution continuous infusion . All technique require regular monitoring patient 's serum potassium level appropriate alteration administration regime . From theoretical standpoint would make sense give potassium continuous infusion allow slow steady correction hypokalaemia . A continuous infusion prevent rapid fluctuation serum level could cause intermittent infusion , may precipitate arrhythmia . However continuous infusion require vigilant monitoring ensure hyperkalaemia occur must give central vein avoid risk phlebitis . The use intermittent infusion use safely critical care set physician guidance . A retrospective review report outcomes administration 495 infusion set 190 individual . While identified 2 instance post-infusion hyperkalaemia , neither associated adverse sequela . Analysis show correlation serum potassium increase post-infusion serum creatinine , thus advocate use therapy patient renal failure . In light valuable safety data , proceed prospective cohort study involve 40 patient Intensive Care Unit . Again outcomes favourable mean increase 0.48mmol/L administration 20mmol 100ml saline 1 hour . They report instance hyperkalaemia , data suggest decreased instance ectopic beat versus control patient . The use variable dose regime dictate serum potassium concentration also assess . In prospective cohort study 20 , 30 40mmol administer 1 hour 48 patient base initial measured potassium level . They report 2 instance hyperkalaemia neither patient experience complication . Usefully find patient oliguric renal failure ( creatinine 283 ± 127 micromol/L ) great mean increase potassium level infusion patient normal creatinine clearance . Two method suggest . The first , assessed paediatric intensive care unit , administer potassium rate 0.25mmol/kg/hr patient serum potassium &lt; 3.5mmol/L ECG abnormality . The infusion continue ECG abnormality correct . Serum potassium n't measure complete infusion , although mean increase 0.75mmol/L , method expose patient risk unmonitored hyperkalaemia . The involves use feedback system computer-algorithm drive protocol . This method develop full production model due lack cost-effectiveness . We unable find trial assess efficacy safety continuous potassium infusion critical care population , felt time rectify . Critically ill patient often hypokalaemic due insensible loss , inadequate supplementation prior admission , use diuretic beta-agonists . At time often acute and/or chronic renal failure may metabolic acidosis hamper normal potassium sequestration excretion . Thus risk rapidly develop life-threatening hyperkalaemia supplementation carefully titrate serial monitoring . Continuous infusion administer due vigilance allow correction hypokalaemia safe precise manner . Our department use supplement potassium intermittent infusion , internal discussion successfully implement continuous infusion protocol . We propose continuous infusion administer accredited nurse physician direction safely deliver potassium correct abnormal level .</detailed_description>
