	<detailed_description>This three-year study . In first year , conduct pilot study test feasibility implement integrated model frailty , osteoporosis , depression , outcomes . Another objective determine optimal sample size next level intervention year 2 3 ( 2009 study ) . Subjects community-dwelling Taiwanese elder ( 65-79 year age ) living Toufen Town Miaoli County , Taiwan . Subjects first screen telephone interview Chinese Canadian Study Health Aging _Clinical Frailty Scale ( CCSHA_CFS ) . Eligible subject invite community hospital screen Health Study Phenotypic Classification Frailty ( CHS_PCF ) . Subjects score ≥ 1 CHS_PCF enrol . With 2 2 factorial design , subject first randomize exercise/nutrition integrate care ( ENIC ) group usual care ( UC ) group education . Within group , subject randomize problem solve therapy ( PST ) usual care ( UC ) group education study care manager pre-specified protocol . UC group subject receive study educational booklet telephone follow compliance booklet reading suggest diet exercise program . Besides booklet , ENIC group subject receive structured exercise 3 times/week nutrition consultation need hospital 3 month PST group subject receive 6 session PST hospital 3 month . Subjects follow 3 , 6 12 month . Primary outcome improvement CHS_PCF least one category ( pre-frail robust , frail pre-frail robust ) baseline analysis . Secondary outcome include physical function performance , cognition , depression , quality life , healthcare resource utilization bone-mineral density ( BMD ) . Intention-to-treat analysis apply . The pilot study enrol 117 subject , analysis preliminary result , study protocol second third year ( 2009 study ) modify follow : 1 . The study conduct one urban ( Wanhua ) one rural ( Toufen ) site roughly 150 participant site . 2 . Convenient sample refer participant physician ' clinic instead population base sample year 1 use decrease administration cost . 3 . Telephone base first stage screen instrument modify validated face face interview . 4 . Longer intervention period ( 6-months ) year 1 . 5 . Interventions provide ENIC PSTIC group combine single integrate care ( IC ) group . Interventions IC group UC group minor change , describe . UC group : Inform subject result frailty , osteoporosis depression assessment . The study educational booklet CD-ROM frailty , depression , osteoporosis , healthy diet , exercise protocol , self-coping strategy give participant . One 2-hour educational session provide participant go booklet demonstration study exercise protocol . Subjects encourage balanced nutrition regular exercise home follow study protocol . Subjects contact bimonthly check much read watch study material , well comply suggest diet exercise protocol . However , subject ' discretion discus primary care physician regard clinical intervention . IC group : Subjects receive intervention provide UC group . Furthermore , subject take exercise/rehabilitation course participate hospital twice week 24 week 6 session problem solve treatment ( PST ) . If subject improve 5 indicator ( CHSPCF ) , comprehensive geriatric assessment ( CGAs ) apply identify potential modifiable factor frailty individualized management .
