	<brief_summary>Background : Recent data indicate home nocturnal hemodialysis ( 8 hour hemodialysis home 5-6 night per week ) may substantial cardiovascular benefit , include regression leave ventricular ( LV ) hypertrophy , improve LV ejection fraction blood pressure control . Nevertheless , dialysis modality feasible highly-selected minority ESRD patient , self-manage dialysis treatment home . In-centre nocturnal hemodialysis ( INHD ) , administer 7-8 hour hemodialysis hospital 3 night per week , represent appeal practical alternative . As novel form therapy , definitive study examine cardiovascular impact INHD date . Objective : To determine effect INHD LV mass , global regional systolic diastolic function , cardiovascular biomarkers patient ESRD . Hypothesis : Conversion conventional hemodialysis INHD associate favourable change cardiac structure function patient ESRD . Rationale Using Cardiac MRI : Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) emerge new gold standard measure LV mass , volume , global regional myocardial function . Its accuracy precision make image modality choice study small number patient currently undergo await INHD . Study Design Population : This prospective cohort study adult ESRD patient currently receive conventional in-centre hemodialysis convert INHD . Patients manage per standard clinical practice ( e.g . blood pressure , anemia management ) establish INHD program , therapeutic intervention perform part study . All eligible patient undergo two serial CMR examination : within 2 week prior conversion 52 week follow conversion INHD . We also plan recruit population control patient elect remain conventional HD . These individual ask undergo set investigation baseline 12 month thereafter . Outcome : The primary endpoint temporal change LV mass size , global regional diastolic systolic function 52 week conversion INHD , measure cardiac MRI . Secondary endpoint include change myocardial tissue characteristic , blood pressure , mineral metabolic parameter , anemia control , serum troponin , norepinephrine , brain natriuretic peptide , marker inflammation quality life . Significance : The provision enhance dialysis regimen emerge promising avenue modify dismal cardiovascular outcome patient receive chronic hemodialysis . INHD represent mean administer therapy broad spectrum dialysis patient home therapy would feasible . The propose study first precisely define cardiac impact INHD use CMR . The finding may justify large randomize controlled trial evaluate clinical outcome . If INHD proven effective , major impact management outcome many patient ESRD Canada .</brief_summary>
