	<brief_title>Correlation Clinical Behaviour Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC ) After Debulking Nephrectomy With Tumor Gene Expression Nephrectomy Specimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) tumor clinically apparent immunologic phenomenon , response immunotherapy ( interferon , interleukin-2 , immune cellular therapy etc ) , spontaneous regression , sometimes indolent behaviour . Nephrectomy influence prognosis advance RCC patient show 2 randomised trial , could immune basis . We previously report variability clinical behaviour advance RCC patient receive systemic treatment debulking nephrectomy ( Debulking Nephrectomy Followed By A `` Watch And Wait '' Approach In Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma .Wong A , et al . Urol Oncol , press ) . The clinical significance include avoidance toxic systemic therapy nephrectomy , possibility use non-toxic vaccine approach metastatic patient cytoreductive nephrectomy . In research proposal would like analyse immune relate gene expression profile nephrectomy tumor sample correlate clinical course patient nephrectomy . This exploratory retrospective study 15 patient debulking nephrectomy advanced RCC do , receive adjuvant treatment , clinical course monitor nephrectomy . We first carry feasibility study isolate RNA 3 FFPE ( formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded ) sample use commercially available RNA isolation kit determine quality compatible quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) microarray study . Upon successful feasibility study , analysis extend 15 patient . RNA isolate FFPE sample gene expression profile evaluate qPCR and/or microarray . Emphasis place expression profile immune-related gene . Finally , transcriptome analysis result extend protein cell level use immunohistochemistry assay .</detailed_description>
