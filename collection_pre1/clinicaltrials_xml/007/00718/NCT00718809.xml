	<brief_title>Saracatinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Thymoma Thymic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient relapse refractory thymoma thymic carcinoma treat AZD0530 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity AZD0530 patient . II . To evaluate progression-free survival patient . III . To evaluate overall survival patient . IV . To evaluate disease control rate , define complete response , partial response , stable disease , patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral saracatinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
