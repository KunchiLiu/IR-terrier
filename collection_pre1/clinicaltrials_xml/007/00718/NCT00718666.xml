	<brief_title>The Long-term Antibody Persistence GSK Biologicals ' Meningococcal Vaccine GSK134612 Healthy Toddlers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK Biologicals develop meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( GSK134612 ) . This candidate vaccine show well tolerate immunogenic toddler . The purpose study evaluate antibody persistence approximately 1 year , 3 year 5 year post-administration one dose two dos GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Biologicals ' meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 give healthy toddler 9-12 month age . To evaluate , safety immunogenicity booster dose GSK134612 administer eligible subject 5 year primary vaccination . To evaluate safety immunogenicity new group subject age 5-6 year ( naive control group ) receive single dose vaccine GSK134612 .</detailed_description>
