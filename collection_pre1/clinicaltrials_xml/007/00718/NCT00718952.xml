	<brief_title>The Efficacy Safety Vardenafil Treatment Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , define mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mmHg pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≤15 mmHg measure cardiac catheterization , disorder may occur either set variety underlie medical condition disease uniquely affect pulmonary circulation . Irrespective etiology , PAH serious often progressive disorder result right ventricular dysfunction impairment activity tolerance , may lead right-heart failure death . The pathogenesis PAH complex incompletely understood , include genetic environmental factor alter vascular structure function . In recent year , several new drug develop treatment pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , include continuous intravenous epoprostenol , inhale iloprost , subcutaneous trepostinil , oral bosentan , oral beraprost . In addition , increase evidence therapeutic effectiveness phosphodiesterase-5 ( PDE-5 ) inhibitor sildenafil PAH . Phosphodiesterases superfamily enzymes inactivate cyclic adenosine monophosphate cyclic guanosine monophosphate , second messenger prostacyclin nitric oxide ( NO ) .The phosphodiesterases different tissue distribution substrate affinity . Interestingly , PDE-5 abundantly express lung tissue , thus offer target molecule PAH treatment concept . The three commercially available PDE-5 inhibitor ( sildenafil , vardenafil , tadalafil ) currently approve treatment erectile dysfunction . These inhibitor receive attention activity pulmonary vasculature . Sildenafil prove improve exercise capacity pulmonary hemodynamics PAH patient , however , report regard use vardenafil tadalafil pulmonary vasculature . Although sildenafil , vardenafil , tadalafil act enzyme , drug exhibit different pharmacokinetics selectivity , therefore may equally efficacious pulmonary vascular bed . As vardenafil 20-fold great potency sildenafil inhibit purified PDE-5 , assume show favorable clinical side-effect profile treat PAH . This prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , pilot study evaluate efficacy safety vardenafil treatment pulmonary arterial hypertension .</detailed_description>
