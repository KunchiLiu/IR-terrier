	<brief_summary>Up 120 patient chronic hepatitis C enrol study viral kinetics liver gene expression combination therapy peginterferon ribavirin . Adult patient chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection compensate liver disease receive interferon past randomized one four group . Groups A C undergo liver biopsy start peginterferon therapy Groups B D undergo biopsy 6 hour initial dose peginterferon . Furthermore , Groups C D receive run-in period 4 week ribavirin therapy start peginterferon . All patient receive standard recommend dos peginterferon alfa 2a ( 180 mcg sc weekly ) ribavirin ( 1000 1200 mg daily genotype 1 , 4-6 800 mg daily genotype 2 3 ) 48 week ( 24 week genotype 2 3 ) . All patient Groups C D , irrespective genotype , pretreated ribavirin dose 1000 1200 mg , depend patient body-weight . After initial peginterferon injection , patient blood take symptom record 6 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour weekly thereafter four week assess viral kinetic response . Liver biopsy tissue take 6 hour initial dose peginterferon assess standard light microscopy also subject RNA extraction microarray analysis mRNA expression . Patients monitor carefully therapy test regularly HCV RNA level . Therapy give 48 week , discontinue early patient genotype 1 infection HCV RNA level decline least 2 log IU/ml week 12 ( lack early virological response ) decline undetectable level week 24 ( lack HCV RNA clearance ) . Patients genotype treat full course therapy regardless early response . After complete therapy , patient follow 4 8 week interval undergo repeat medical evaluation liver biopsy 24 week stop therapy . The primary clinical criterion success therapy sustain virological response , mark absence HCV RNA serum least 24 week stop . The focus study , however , viral kinetics compare patient pretreated ribavirin ( Groups C D ) ( Groups A B ) well gene expression study assess effect peginterferon intrahepatic mRNA profile compare Group A B effect ribavirin compare Group A Group C Group B Group D. Results also compare different HCV genotype . These study aim assess mechanisms action peginterferon ribavirin HCV evaluate basis lack virologic response combination therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 18 year , male female Presence HCV RNA ( without antiHCV ) serum level least 10,000 IU/ml . Willingness undergo liver biopsy 6 hour initial injection peginterferon . Written informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Previous adequate treatment form type I interferon ( standard alpha interferon , peginterferon , beta interferon ) . Adequate treatment consider least 12 week therapy . Other antiviral therapy within last 6 month . If cirrhosis present , decompensated liver disease , mark bilirubin great 4 mg percent , albumin less 3.0 gm percent , prothrombin time great 2 sec prolong , history bleed esophageal varix , ascites hepatic encephalopathy . Serum ALT AST level great 1000 micro/L ( great 25 time ULN ) . Such patient enrol may follow three consecutive determination level . Pregnancy current breastfeeding . In woman child bear potential spouse woman , inability practice adequate contraception , define vasectomy men , tubal ligation woman , use condom spermicide , birth control pill , intrauterine device 6 month end treatment ribavirin give potential teratogenicity . Significant systemic major illness include congestive heart failure , organ transplantation , serious psychiatric disease depression , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , angina pectoris . Preexisting anemia ( hematocrit le 33 percent ) know history hemolytic anemia . In patient Groups C D , liver biopsy perform hemoglobin level fall 11 g/dl ribavirin monotherapy . Epopoetin alfa darbopoietin alfa therapy available achieve adequate hematocrit clinically indicate patient group . Immunosuppressive therapy either corticosteroid ( 5 mg prednisone daily chronic basis ) major immunosuppressive agent ( azathioprine 6mercaptopurine ) . Patients receive shortcourse corticosteroid acute allergic reaction asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation ( less 2 week therapy ) eligible study 4 week therapy . Evidence another form liver disease addition viral hepatitis ( example autoimmune liver disease , Wilson 's disease , alcoholic liver disease , hemochromatosis , alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency ) . Patients concomitant nonalcoholic steatohepatitis form chronic liver disease exclude study . Evidence coronary artery disease cerebral vascular disease , include abnormality exercise stress test patient define risk factor screen evidence underlie coronary artery disease . Active substance abuse , alcohol , inhale injection drug within previous year . Evidence hepatocellular carcinoma ; either alphafetoprotein ( AFP ) level great 200 ng/ml ( normal less 9 ng/ml ) and/or ultrasound ( image study ) demonstrate mass suggestive liver cancer . Clinical gout . Active , serious autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosis , ulcerative colitis , Crohn disease rheumatoid arthritis opinion investigator might exacerbate therapy alpha interferon . These exclusion criterion consider standard relative contraindication peginterferon ribavirin therapy .</criteria>
