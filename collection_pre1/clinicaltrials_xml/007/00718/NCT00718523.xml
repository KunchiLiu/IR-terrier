	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed optimally debulked ( &lt; 1 cm ) FIGO stage III stage IV ( positive pleural cytology ) ovarian epithelial ( include fallopian tube primary peritoneal ) carcinoma . Patients undergone surgical debulking , surgeon experience management ovarian cancer , aim maximal surgical cytoreduction . All patient must optimally debulked defined residual tumor great 1 cm post surgical setting . Patients stage IV disease eligible positive pleural cytology extra peritoneal disease . Paraffin block ( 10 20 unstained slide ) fresh frozen surgical/biopsy specimen primary tumor require baseline . No prior systemic treatment primary disease treatment set . Female ≥ 18 year age legal age . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 . Adequate organ bone marrow function Non diabetic patient Type 1 2 Diabetic Patients : • Diabetes must control HgbA1c &lt; 8 % fast blood glucose level &lt; 160 mg/dL . Patient must willing able comply schedule visit , study procedure . Informed consent obtain . Patients able commence systemic therapy within 6 week cytoreductive surgery . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week . Adequate coagulation parameter ( within 14 day prior randomization ) , International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ≤1.5 ; Activated Prothrombin Time ( APTT ) ≤ 1.5 x ULN Nonepithelial ovarian cancer , include malignant mixed Mullerian tumor . Borderline tumor ( tumor low malignant potential ) . Planned intraperitoneal cytotoxic chemotherapy . Prior systemic anticancer therapy ovarian cancer . Any previous radiotherapy abdomen pelvis . Patients synchronous primary endometrial carcinoma , past history primary endometrial carcinoma , exclude unless ALL follow criterion describe endometrial carcinoma meet : Stage ≤ Ib , superficial myometrial invasion , lymphovascular invasion , poorly differentiate ( i.e. , Grade 3 papillary serous clear cell ) . Diagnosis second malignancy within last 5 year , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ carcinoma cervix uteri curatively treated DCIS/LCIS , nonmelanoma situ melanoma skin cancer . Prior treatment humanize monoclonal antibody anticancer therapeutic . Prior treatment investigational treatment target IGF axis include , limited , CP 751,871 , IMA12 , RO4858696 . Previous exposure AMG 479 . Anticipation need major surgical procedure radiation therapy study . History hypersensitivity recombinant protein . Treatment radiotherapy , surgery , investigational agent within 4 week randomization . Any follow within 6 month prior study enrollment : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina pectoris , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , NYHA class III IV congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , grade &gt; 2 peripheral neuropathy , pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis , thromboembolic event . History brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis . Patient childbearing potential pregnant ( eg , positive human chorionic gonadotropin test ) breast feeding . Patient childbearing potential willing use adequate contraceptive precaution . Known active infection , antiretroviral therapy HIV disease . Known positive test chronic hepatitis B C infection . Any underlying physical mental condition render patient unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study . Refusal inability give inform consent participate study . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , significant laboratory abnormality require investigation may cause undue risk patient 's safety , inhibit protocol participation , interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study</criteria>
