	<brief_title>Overall Survival Inoperable Gastric/GastroOesophageal Cancer Subjects Treating With LMWH + Chemotherapy ( CT ) v Standard CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In GASTRANOX study , patient inoperable ( locally advance ) metastatic newly diagnose gastric gastro oesophageal cancer . These patient carry definite thrombosis risk . Patients schedule least 6 month palliative chemotherapy . During period symptomatic thromboembolism common currently routine prophylaxis provide . The dose Enoxaparin evaluate study 1mg/kg . This represent half full treatment dose . For average weight individual represent 60 70 mg day Enoxaparin . The prophylactic dose high-risk surgical patient United States 60mg total daily dose Enoxaparin per day . This high-risk dose show safe effective prevent thromboembolic disease high-risk population undergo major elective orthopaedic surgery . An alternative high-risk dose 40mg give day . This dose also effective safe . Thus dose provide GASTRANOX study markedly different high-risk dos already routine clinical practice either North America ( 30mg twice day - 60mg total daily dose ) 40mg day Europe . It also half full treatment dose show effective safe treatment venous thromboembolism . Since cancer patient recognise bleed risk felt inappropriate provide full treatment dose Enoxaparin . Thus half full treatment dos provide . On hand biological effect low molecular weight heparin cancer suggest high dos give enhance potential survival benefit . The study intend evaluate safety efficacy study drug compare best normal practice . The standard methodology comparison conduct randomize , comparative study . Multi-centre : It anticipate single centre unable recruit sufficient subject , 1 year , conduct assessment therefore multiple centre recruit conduct study . Open Label : All patient receive standard care site . It would feasible expect placebo parenteral administration six month . All VTE event adjudicate . Mortality objective end-point . Standard treatment control : subject treat accord best practice half also receive study treatment . Parallel-group : due nature condition practical design .</detailed_description>
