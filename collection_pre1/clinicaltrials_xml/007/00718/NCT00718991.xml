	<brief_summary>This investigation design assess immediate long-term angiographic patency outcome excimer laser recanalisation follow PTA treatment long ( &gt; 50 mm ) infrapopliteal lesion patient critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) The Spectranetics Turbo elite™ excimer laser catheter percutaneous intravascular device construct multiple optical fiber around guidewire lumen . The laser catheter transmit ultraviolet energy Spectranetics CVX-300® Excimer Laser System obstruction artery . The ultraviolet energy deliver tip laser catheter photo-ablate fibrous , calcific atheromatous lesion , thus recanalizing diseased vessel .</brief_summary>
