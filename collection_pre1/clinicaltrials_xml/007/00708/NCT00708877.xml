	<brief_summary>Today , available therapy hilar cholangiocarcinomas ( CCA ) satisfactory . Although tumor rare , study important high death rate afflict patient , rival pancreatic cancer . Surgical resection offer current hope long-term survival , average 20 % major series1 . The reality majority patient , CCA diagnosis despair . Although surgery offer hope cure , one major limit factor achieve long-term survival follow surgical resection CCA technical ability achieve negative resection margin . The presence malignant cell surgical margin follow resection major prognostic factor predict recurrence death . Theoretically , likelihood achieve negative margin increase total hepatectomy orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) . Previous experience OLT perform isolation hilar CCA 's discourage dismal survival rate . However , recent report demonstrate long-term survival occur carefully select patient combine benefit radiotherapy , chemosensitization , OLT . With strategy , patient survival rate 92 % , 82 % , 82 % 1 , 3 , 5 year transplantation achieve . It clear preliminary result confirm center , clear selection criterion optimally use treatment strategy . Our hypothesis select patient undergo liver transplantation CCA context multi-modality neoadjuvant therapy exhibit survival equivalent establish indication liver transplantation previously demonstrate . We also attempt extend previously publish criterion liver transplantation set CCA offer protocol patient evidence intrahepatic disease regional nodal disease . Patients undergo transplantation CCA follow longitudinally entire post-transplant course compare matched cohort liver transplant recipient regard post-transplant survival , survival wait list , well complication pre-and post-transplantation . Explanted liver examine presence residual tumor . Data collect rate regional lymph node metastasis , invasion adjacent organ tissue , rate peritoneal metastasis . The rate tumor recurrence , site , time recurrence also assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Specific Aim # 1 : Determine whether result obtain select patient American Joint Commission Cancer ( AJCC ) Staging System Stage I II CCA transferable select patient T3 N1 disease . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine whether success achieve publish protocol currently use directly transferable University Utah 's liver transplant program . Liver Transplant Protocol : The surgical protocol initially offer liver transplant candidate de novo hilar CCA CCA arise set PSC . Diagnosis CCA establish intraluminal brush cytology , intraluminal biopsy , carcinoma antigen ( CA ) 19.9 level great 100 ng / mL set radiographic malignant stricture . Biliary aneuploidy demonstrate DIA FISH consider equivalent cytology . All patient CCA evaluate liver transplant team include experienced hepatobiliary liver transplant surgeon . Patients present weekly liver transplant selection conference ass candidacy well weekly GI Multidisciplinary Tumor Conference Huntsman Cancer Institute . Clinical stag prior neoadjuvant therapy include chest abdominal compute tomography , liver ultrasound , bone scan . Patients also undergo endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration suspicious lymph node . Exclusion criterion include previous chemotherapy radiotherapy , uncontrolled infection , previous malignance non-melanoma skin cancer situ cervical cancer within last five year , medical condition preclude transplantation , metastatic disease ( include N2 disease ) , patient hilar tumor extend cystic duct . All patient undergo stag laparoscopy rule presence peritoneal disease follow stag laparotomy . Patients extrahepatic metastasis , local spread disease adjacent organ , N2 nodal disease ( metastasis peripancreatic , periduodenal , periportal , celiac , superior mesenteric , / posterior pancreaticoduodenal node ) exclude patient extension tumor main portal vein . Patients N1 disease ( metastasis lymph node within hepatoduodenal ligament ) remain eligible protocol . Tumor size include exclusion criterion . Patients evidence disease progression beyond study criterion eligible continue liver transplantation .</detailed_description>
