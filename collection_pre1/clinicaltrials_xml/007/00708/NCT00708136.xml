	<brief_summary>The propose project Randomized Controlled study design . Seniors ( age &gt; 65 ) willing participate study shortly interview assess eligibility accord inclusion-exclusion criterion . The first 60 subject upon question judge meet follow inclusion criterion : 1. able stand independently 90 second 2. able walk 10 meter ( cane necessary ) 3. able understand verbal instruction . The exclusion criterion : 1 . Serious visual impairment 2 . Inability ambulate independently ( cane acceptable , walker ) . 3 . Severely impaired cognitive status ( score less 24 Mini Mental State Examination ) . 4 . Persons impaired communication capability . The whole project conduct period 24 month . The propose study randomize experimental intervention/ control group design . A total 60 elderly volunteer subject randomly assign two group , exercise group ( 30 ) control group ( 30 ) . Twelve train period perform 8 subject participate training period ( 4 exercise group ) . The exercise group meet 24 occasion period 12 week ( 2 times/week ) . Gait balance function test group well establish measure technique train period . The measure technique 1 . Medical background variable . 2 . Berg Balance Scale . 3 . Late life Function Disability Instrument . 4 . Get go test - stand walk 3 meter turn around walk back chair . 5 . Fall Efficacy Scale 6 . Fall incidence fall severity . 7 . 6-minute walk test . The control group perform specific balance training 12 week period . These individual control participate separate exercise program training period . The water training intervention perform different level level reflect different increase demand postural control system . The water exercise also include perturbation exercise trigger specific reflex-like balance response . On level instructor instantly modify exercise less challenging participant .</brief_summary>
