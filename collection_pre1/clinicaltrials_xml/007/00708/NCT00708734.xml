	<brief_title>Exercise Intervention Reduce Postural Instability Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Impaired gait balance ( refer impaired postural stability ) one significant cause consequence fall . Persons osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee represent one large patient population impair postural stability . Specifically , knee OA show reduce walk speed , shorten stride length prolong stance phase gait cycle . Patients knee OA also less range motion hip , knee ankle joint . Functional Exercise Training ( FET ) show improve gait balance , decrease fall associate fall-related injury general elderly population . While traditional exercise program well-tolerated person knee OA ( due pain ) , interested whether tailored FET intervention would effective patient population . Immediate Objectives : O1 : Characterize etiology mechanism postural instability person knee OA ; O2 : Refine clinical protocol FET veterans knee OA ; O3 : Refine sampling plan ; O4 : Refine data collection protocol . This 1-year feasibility study use prospective cohort design , include data collection baseline three point post intervention ( 10 week { end intervention } , 15 week , 20 week ) . Subjects knee osteoarthritis enrol . Inclusion Criteria : Age 60 older ; Corrected vision worse 20/50 ; Ability ambulate household distance without assistive device - minimum functional status ambulation primary mode mobility ; presence knee OA base clinical radiological criterion . Sample size : 36 subject . Intervention : Participants attend FET class twice weekly 10 week . Our primary outcome composite measure postural stability ( gait balance ) OA symptoms/physical disability . Secondary outcome measure include fall self-efficacy quality life . We also collect case history postural instability fall well data key mediating variable , include level participation ( dose intervention ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , analgesic use , tolerance intervention , number joint affect OA . Measurement tool : Balance measure Sensory Organization Test Limits Stability test use Neurocom Smart Balance Master Berg Balance Test ; Gait measure multiple kinetic kinematic variable use VICON 3-D Motion Analysis System ; OA symptoms/physical disability measure use Western Ontario McMaster University Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) Osteoarthritis Index ; Fall self-efficacy Modified Fall Self Efficacy Scale ; Quality life Short Form 36v ( SF-36v ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 50 older . Corrected vision bad 20/50 . Ability ambulate household distance without assistive device minimum functional status ambulation primary mode mobility . Presence knee OA base clinical radiological criterion . Cognitive impairment Mini Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) score &lt; 24 ; Scores 24 indicate cognitive impairment , limit ability participate group and/or remember instruction . Metastatic cancer , since limit ability fully participate group and/or complete intervention due limited life expectancy change functional status . Central peripheral neurological dysfunction e.g . diagnosis hemiparesis , cerebellar dysfunction , Parkinson 's disease , peripheral neuropathy without foot drop , determine medical record review physical exam ; Severe Peripheral Vascular Disease claudication Spinal Stenosis pseudoclaudication/chronic low back pain ; These impairment would impair gait balance , would jeopardize safety intervention and/or confound effect intervention . Lower extremity amputation , foot deformity ; Mobility limitation due alter low extremity skin integrity/ulcer , weightbearing would contraindicate ( foot ulcer ) , since would affect gait balance measure . Use medication know impair balance , e.g . antipsychotic , benzodiazepine , antiepileptic , etc . would affect gait balance measure . Severe arthritis limit basic activity daily live ( ADL ) offer pending joint replacement , since unlikely nonpharmacological intervention would effective . Total knee replacement one side , since gait balance change due total knee replacement would confound effect intervention . Current involvement physical therapy , since would confound result . Medically unstable upon exam , i.e . poorly control blood pressure blood sugar , unstable coronary artery disease , since group participation may compromise medical status . Morbid obesity ( BMI &gt; 40 ) due potential change gait variable ( speed , cadence , stride length ) . Weight 300 pound ( due limitation Neurocom force plate ) .</criteria>
