	<brief_summary>The potentially damaging effect free O2 radical culture embryo may reduce add scavenger culture medium reduce incubator O2 level . However , lower O2 culture environment expensive , troublesome may justifiable . The objective study evaluate effect lower incubator O2 tension live birth rate predominately day-5 embryo transfer program . The hypothesis study lower ( physiological ) oxygen concentration embryo culture incubator increase live birth rate vitro fertilization patient . 230 first-cycle woman undergo routine IVF ICSI ejaculate sperm randomized prospective clinical trial stratify patient age physician . Embryos patient randomly assign culture either 21 % O2 ( atmospheric ) 5 % O2 ( reduce ) environment . Clinical endpoint monitor rate implantation , clinical pregnancy , live birth blastocyst cryopreservation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study determine physiological oxygen concentration ( 5 % ) improve clinical outcome compare industry standard 21 % . Background : For embryo grow incubator , atmospheric gas concentration close possible see oviduct uterus . Currently , atmospheric ( non-physiological , 21 % ) oxygen concentration use incubator culture embryos infertility patient Presbyterian ARTS laboratory . Literature suggest culture animal embryo reduce oxygen environment significantly improve embryo quality clinical outcome . Both 5 % atmospheric oxygen concentration routinely use embryo culture human IVF laboratory , however , commercial human IVF facility invest oxygen control expensive maintain labor intensive implement . The goal use low oxygen concentration future clinical improvement justifies expense increase labor associate low oxygen culture . Project Summary : Study design : The study conduct prospective , randomized way . Two treatment group consider : 1 ) exist atmospheric oxygen concentration embryo incubator 2 ) low 5 % oxygen concentration embryo culture incubator . To allow well-documented decline pregnancy rate increase age , patient stratify within 4 age group 3 physician within treatment . The age group : donor egg ; &lt; 35 year ; 35 37 year ; 38 40 year determine day egg retrieval . Endpoints Measured : The endpoint measure embryo cryopreservation-biochemical pregnancy- , clinical pregnancy- , ongoing pregnancy- , live birth- embryo implantation rate . Number Patients Study : To detect difference 10 % pregnancy rate , 150 patient include treatment group . With current patient volume , take less one year complete study . Differences implantation rate may detect early ( embryos transfer patient enrol ) . Should significance difference pregnancy rate become evident full number patient enrol , study may terminate . Study Location : The study conduct ARTS facility Presbyterian Hospital Plano . Criteria Inclusion Subjects : All patient undergo first IVF cycle donor oocyte cycle eligible participate laboratory comparison . The egg may fertilize conventional IVF methodology use intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) . When perform ICSI , ejaculate sperm must use . Patients use egg must 40 year age young day egg retrieval . The Presbyterian Hospital ARTS Program perform ~900 egg retrieval 2000 . Of , ~500 would meet inclusion criterion study . Criteria Exclusion Subjects : To reduce tremendous patient variability see infertile patient population , first cycle patient 40 year age young day egg retrieval participate . Sources Research Material : Patients enrol study regular patient pool present Presbyterian ARTS Program treatment infertility . Data collect specifically research purpose . Data use collected ARTS patient , regardless participation study . Recruitment Subjects : Subjects study recruit regular patient pool present ARTS Program treatment infertility . Patients meet inclusion criterion study identify prospectively . Information study include routine , biweekly , group laboratory nurse orientation session . Potential Risks : Patients consent comparison allow embryo culture either standard atmospheric oxygen concentration reduce , physiological oxygen concentration . Atmospheric ( 21 % ) oxygen concentration current standard program . Both method consider industry standard . To best knowledge report animal literature , low oxygen culture well rather bad condition propose study . No culture condition culture medium compositions/ingredients apply comparison experimental . However , atmospheric oxygen concentration lower ( 5 % ) oxygen concentration compare control , randomized way suggest comparison , ARTS Program guarantee pregnancy outcome equivalent treatment group . Therefore , randomize , patient may include group low success rate . Special Precautions : If become clear early study either one treatment superior , study discontinue best condition implement future patient .</detailed_description>
