	<brief_summary>Background : The small bowel black box gastrointestinal ( GI ) endoscopy , recently , small bowel accessible conventional endoscope . Double-balloon enteroscopy ( DBE ) endoscopic procedure visualize entire small bowel . The method first describe Yamamoto colleague 2001 . Both endoscopic diagnosis treatment easily perform use DBE . The first large series , recently publish , demonstrate DBE feasible visualize large part small bowel . Although DBE widely use routinely examine small intestine issue may limit use . The preparation handle DBE-endoscope often interpret complex ( attach balloon tip endoscope , inflating/deflating two balloon system ) . Recently , novel balloon enteroscope system develop use single balloon ( single balloon enteroscope , SBE ) . SBE design facilitate diagnosis treatment small bowel . The endoscopist need manipulate one single balloon ; thereby , time complexity preparation system examination may reduce . However , new SBE system may less efficient deep intubation small bowel may cause adverse effect due hook endoscope straighten endoscope . Study Aim : The primary aim present study compare new SBE system standard DBE system respect completeness visualisation insertion depth small bowel , well complication procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : The study design multicenter randomize controlled trial . The participate center Rikshospitalet University Hospital ( Dept . Gastroenterology ) , Oslo , Norway , University Hospital Muenster ( Dept . Medicine B ) , Muenster , Germany Erasmus Medical Center , Rotterdam , The Netherlands . Randomization : Randomization SBE DBE perform basis individual participant . Equally large group randomize use block randomization ( block six patient ) participate center . Randomization ( use SPSS statistical software package ) perform independent researcher , part endoscopy team . Double-balloon procedure : DBE perform use DBE T-type endoscope system ( Fujinon Inc , Japan ) , described literature . The DBE endoscope consist 200-cm long video endoscope outer diameter 8.5 mm flexible overtube length 145 cm outer diameter 12 mm . Latex balloon attach endoscope overtube . These balloon inflate deflated insertion , describe elsewhere detail . Single-balloon procedure : SBE perform use SBE endoscope system ( SIF-Q180 , Olympus Optical Co. , Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) . The SBE endoscope consist 200-cm long video endoscope outer diameter 9.2 mm flexible overtube length 140 cm outer diameter 13.2 mm . One single balloon attach tip overtube . The insertion process follow method use DBE , instead inflation endoscope balloon , tip endoscope angulate straighten . Ethics : The regional ethic committee participate center ask approval study protocol . Power analysis : The present study non-inferiority study , aim show equality two endoscope system regard main endpoint . A pilot study include 20 patient group perform since data present literature respect main endpoint . The difference percentage complete visualization two group use power-driving endpoint . The result pilot study use power calculation study apply inferiority-thesis . P-values &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Ad addendum : The manufacturer one instrument present trial ( Olympus ) approach investigator late January 2009 possible risk increase adverse event Olympus endoscope . The company aware detail regard nature event magnitude potential risk , warn solely base unpublished rumor GI community . To prevent participant present trial harm , investigator decide perform interim analysis include patient include trial February 1 , 2009 , rule possible adverse event poor performance one involve treatment arm . No stopping rule apply interim analysis .</detailed_description>
