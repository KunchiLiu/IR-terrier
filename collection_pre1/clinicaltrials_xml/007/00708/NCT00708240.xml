	<brief_summary>Although research suggest patient obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) exhibit specific deficit high cognitive process , still unknown deficit relate clinical symptom disorder , response treatment . There two aim propose research . The first examine high cognitive process brain activity affect OCD . The second aim investigate effect specific psychotropic medication ( escitalopram ) high cognitive process brain activity OCD . We investigate 40 youth OCD ( recruit specialize clinic ) differ 40 healthy youth ( recruited local community ) select cognitive test brain imaging paradigm , well explore treatment medication correct reverse observed difference . The final goal research learn mechanism action available treatment , order refine improve short- long-term therapeutic strategy highly debilitate often lifelong disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale . Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) often childhood onset , characterize recurrent obsession compulsion perceive irrational cause significant interference daily function . Neuropsychological and/or neuroimaging investigation consistently implicate pathway involve ventral prefrontal cortical region pathophysiology disorder . In absence attention memory loss , OCD patient perform poorly control task require inhibition automatic response . Dysfunction frontal-striatal-thalamic circuit OCD may mediate abnormality glutamatergic-serotonin neurotransmission , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) unique class psychotropic medication demonstrate efficacy youth ( adult ) disorder . Objectives hypothesis . The first objective study examine executive function , metacognition performance , regional brain activation differ adolescent OCD compare healthy control . Three specific hypothesis test : ( 1 ) adolescent OCD , executive function related frontal cortex impair compare healthy control ; ( 2 ) metacognition performance OCD group lower control group ; ( 3 ) use fMRI , OCD group 's frontal lobe activation task test response inhibition work memory , high control group . The second objective investigate treatment SSRI escitalopram affect executive function , metacognition performance , regional brain activation adolescent OCD . After pharmacotherapy , three specific hypothesis test : ( 1 ) significant improvement baseline OCD group 's frontal executive function metacognition performance ; ( 2 ) difference executive function metacognition performance OCD control group longer significant ; ( 3 ) repeat fMRI procedure , OCD group 's frontal lobe activation show significant decrease baseline . The third objective explore , within patient group , relationship degree clinical change , magnitude pre-post-treatment change neurocognitive performance , regional brain activation . The hypothesis great clinical improvement associate great change select neurocognitive neurofunctional measure . Method . Forty subject , age 13-19 year , primary DSM-IV diagnosis OCD , 40 sex- , age-matched healthy control , recruit Ottawa mental health center community . The study use pre- post-treatment design , include three phase . Phase I : Pre-treatment , OCD subject compare control clinical , neurocognitive , functional brain activation measure . Phase II : The OCD subject receive open treatment escitalopram ( 5 mg 20 mg/day ) 16 week . Phase III : The clinical , neurocognitive , functional brain activation measure repeat OCD subject complete 16 week escitalopram pharmacotherapy , neurocognitive measure control participant 16 week . The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test , Stroop Test , Working Memory Task use assess frontal executive function . The Feeling-of-knowing task Metacognition Questionnaire measure metacognition performance . To investigate regional brain activation ( participant age 15-19 year ) , two functional neuroimaging paradigm use , Go/NoGo n-Back task , regional brain activation measure use fMRI technology . In patient , clinical severity change treatment assess use Children 's Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale , Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory , State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Children , Children Depression Inventory . Statistical method include repeat measure MANOVAS , t-tests , correlational analysis .</detailed_description>
