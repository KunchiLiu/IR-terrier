	<brief_summary>Patients must breast cancer treat Huntsman Cancer Institute eligible trial . OBJECTIVES : To use quantitative FDG-PET , functional MRI ( fMRI ) co-registered anatomic MRI image well understand cognitive disorder know `` chemobrain '' effect 16 -50 % individual receive long-term adjuvant chemotherapy [ Tannock 2004 , Matsuda 2005 ] . The study exploratory obtain proof feasibility pilot data support eventual submission NIH . Neuropsychological Testing A battery test use assess subjective complaint cognitive impairment symptomatic patient cohort . Similarly battery test use assure non-symptomatic patient control group age-matched normal control exhibit cognitive impairment . The following set clinical test perform assess degree cognitive impairment subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , 3 group 8 woman , age 18 65 , participate study . The `` affected patient group '' woman complaint memory dysfunction receive adjuvant chemotherapy ( one anticancer drug use combination surgery ) , treatment breast cancer . These patient treat Huntsman Cancer Institute/Hospital . The second `` patient control group '' age-matched ( age ) woman breast cancer undergone similar chemotherapy complaint memory problem . The non-patient group age-matched ( age ) woman undergone type chemotherapy . These individual recruit friend female family member two breast cancer group . All individual assess dementia ( intellectual deterioration ) brain problem use kind neuropsychological testing . All subject age-matched close possible , eliminate age related effect . Subjects right-handed , primarily-English speaker normal hearing . The purpose study use modern image technique well understand chemobrain . These image technique include FDG-PET ( FDG abbreviation radiopharmaceutical fluorodeoxyglucose PET Positron Emission Tomography ) functional MRI ( fMRI ) ) . They use look metabolism ( chemical activity ) specific area brain entire brain overall . By use FDG-PET doctor see brain activates . By use fMRI doctor see brain work challenge certain mental task make concentrate remember . FDG-PET fMRI might provide important information brain may connect chemotherapy . This study important first step understand problem chemobrain . The imaging evaluation make possible explore change brain function may responsible chemobrain hopefully make possible predict people may affect problem . Many people undergo chemotherapy particularly adjuvant chemotherapy complain cognitive dysfunction many year . This cognitive decline effect 16 -50 % individual receive long-term adjuvant chemotherapy [ Tannock 2004 , Matsuda 2005 ] .Cancer survivor frequently refer cognitive dysfunction `` chemobrain '' `` chemofog . '' The majority individual affect woman undergone adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer . The table summary many study perform assess cognition chemobrain . Women experience chemobrain typically complain inability concentrate , memory dysfunction , word finding difficulty , difficulty learning , slow processing ability , often difficulty write speak . A particularly disturbing complaint many individual inability multitask . Only recently , researcher begin study impact chemotherapy cognitive functioning . This difficult area study however . Part problem assess chemobrain use scientific principal sort problem due chemotherapy due serious illness like cancer result physical debilitation , depression , sleep disruption , hormone shift , fatigue -- affect cognitive functioning . There number theory chemobrain may occur . One type chemotherapy cross blood/brain barrier cause neurotoxicity . Another cognitive problem create certain free radical , toxic element many type chemotherapy produce [ Joshi 2005 ] . Another theory people genetic background make susceptible effect chemotherapy . Most likely single etiologic factor multifactorial process combine predispose certain individual develop chemobrain . Chemotherapy n't cancer treatment may cause cognitive disturbance memory complaint . Other cancer treatment implicate cause complaint cognitive dysfunction include hormone therapy , immunotherapy , radiation therapy . Hormone therapy common woman treat conventional chemotherapy . It entirely clear woman undergo hormone therapy alters amount systemic estrogen experience memory problem . Some study link memory amount estrogen brain . Other study n't find link .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Prescreening conducted ensure subject good neurologic health history seizures neurological disorder , ferromagnetic implant clip body . Subjects righthanded exclusiveEnglish speaker normal hearing . Exclusion criterion : If subject find profound severe depression Neuropsychological Cognitive Testing session may exclude image portion study . This justified imaging session would valid biologic correlate depression rather chemobrain would image . Subjects find profound severe depression notify appropriate referral make get necessary medical care treat depression . Three cohort 8 woman age 65 recruit exploratory pilot study . The `` affected patient cohort '' woman complaint cognitive memory dysfunction receive adjuvant chemotherapy treatment breast cancer . These patient treat Huntsman Cancer Hospital patient Dr Saundra Buys Dr John Ward . The second `` patient control cohort '' agematched woman breast cancer undergone similar adjuvant chemotherapy amount time complaint memory dysfunction . Again primarily patient Drs . Buys Ward . The nonpatient cohort agematched woman undergone type chemotherapy . These individual recruit friend female family member two breast cancer cohort . All individual assess dementia cognitive impairment use battery dementia cognitive/neuropsychological testing . All subject agematched close possible eliminate age relate cognitive effect . Subjects righthanded exclusiveEnglish speaker normal hearing . Prescreening conducted ensure subject good neurologic health history seizures neurological disorder , ferromagnetic implant clip body . Up 40 subject may enrol ensure 24 evaluable subject .</criteria>
