	<brief_summary>This mono-center randomized control trial performed Center Medical Research ( ZMF ) Medical University Graz compose one screen visit ( V1 ) two study visit ( V2 V3 ) . In visit V1 , complete medical examination perform blood sample withdraw check overall condition healthy volunteer . Those accomplish necessary condition enrol trial receive either saline lipid-heparin solution randomize , cross-over design visit V2 V3 . Volunteers arrive ZMF overnight fast , two venous catheter place forearm vein . One venous catheter use continuous infusion lipid-heparin solution ( Intralipid 20 % , 40 ml/h , Fresenius Kabi plus Heparin 250U/h , IMMUNO Baxter AG ) saline , Inulin ( Inutest 25 % , Fresenius Kabi ) . The second venous catheter use blood sampling ( arterialize venous blood ) . Subsequently , two open flow microperfusion ( OFM ) macro-perforated catheter insert subcutaneous tissue abdominal wall continuous sample interstitial fluid . Study visit last 28 hour continuous sample , four additional hour observation infusion discontinuation , visit V2 V3 . Concentrations different cytokine , non-esterified fatty-acids , insulin , glucose , triglyceride inulin retrospectively quantify frozen sample . The primary hypothesis cytokine concentration subcutaneous tissue and/or circulation modify lipid-heparin infusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . General Subjects select participate protocol study visit 1 accord inclusion exclusion criterion . Subsequently randomly assign receive continuously intravenous infusion 0.9 % saline lipid-heparin solution ( Intralipid 20 % , 40 ml/h , Fresenius Kabi plus Heparin 250U/h , IMMUNO Baxter AG ) 28 hour study visit V2 V3 . For study visit 3 , subject first receive 0.9 % saline previous visit , receive intravenously Intralipid 20 % vice versa . 2 . Visit Procedures 2.1 . Screening Day ( Visit 1 ) Volunteers receive overall information study sign write informed consent . Every subject receive assignment number accord inclusion sequence . Physical examination blood withdrawal shall perform data record Case Report Form ( CRF ) follow : - Inclusion/exclusion criterion - Demographic data , medical history concomitant medication - Physical examination - Vital sign - Body weight height , Body mass index ( BMI ) , waist hip circumference waist-to-hip ratio - Blood blood count , hematocrit , hemoglobin , C-reactive protein , free fatty acid , cholesterol , triglyceride , sodium , potassium , calcium - Pregnancy test female subject childbearing potential . 2.2 . Study day ( Visit 2 3 ) During study visit subject shall arrive 7:00 AM ZMF ( Center Medical Research , Medical University Graz ) overnight fast period 12 hour . A pregnancy test female subject childbearing potential perform morning study day . Two short polyethylene catheter insert antecubital vein arm . A first venous cannula exclusively use blood sample arm place thermo regulate box ( Hot-Box ) maintain warmed temperature 50°C whole study period . The second venous cannula use infusion saline lipid-heparin solution inulin . At 8:00 AM , infusion saline Intralipid solution start . At time point continuous infusion inulin via syringe infusion pump start 50mg/Kg bolus maintain continuous rate 0.250 x Creatinin Clearance mg/min , end study period . At 11:00 AM , OFM catheter insert periumbilical area subject . To prevent important delay sample subcutaneous tissue , afferent loop catheter previously fill perfusate solution . Eight milliliter sterile isotonic solution ( ELO MEL isoton , Fresenius Kabi , Austria ) commonly use intravenous infusion add 2.0ml autologous serum previously withdraw volunteer prepare straight sterile condition use perfusate solution OFM catheter . Peristaltic pump start run 12:00 AM infuse perfusate solution perfusion rate ( push-pull mode ) 1µl/min 12:00 AM follow day . Effluent sample subcutaneous tissue collect regular time-intervals venous blood sampling perform parallel . The subject maintain fast condition whole study period . They shall stay research center facility four-hours observation period study procedure finish . At time receive complete meal additional blood sample withdraw access blood glucose aPTT ( activate partial tromboplastin time ) . Normal value ensure volunteer allow leave . 3 . Measurements 3.1 . Cytokines Cytokine concentration measure effluent serum sample use multiplexed flow cytometric bead-based ELISA assay ( LUMINEX®100s System , Luminex Corporation , Texas , USA ) . The following substrate access method : - C-reactive protein - Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) - Interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ) - CCL2/MCP-1 - Serpin E1/PAI-1 - Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) - Adiponectin 3.2 . Insulin Insulin concentration effluent plasma sample measure Joanneum Research Laboratory use solid-phase two-site ELISA ( Mercodia , Uppsala , Sweden ) . 3.3 . Inulin Inulin measure Joanneum Research Laboratory , use fully enzymatic method . 3.4 . Glucose Glucose concentration arterialize blood sample measure duplicate use two Beckman Glucose Analyzer 2 ( Beckman Instruments Inc. , Fullerton , CA ) . 3.5 . Non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFA ) NEFA concentration measure plasma use colorimetric enzymatic method .</detailed_description>
