	<brief_title>In Situ Caries Fluoride Toothpastes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topical fluoride proven clinically effective prevention dental caries . It generally agree anti-caries effect fluoride ( F ) mainly decrease rate enamel demineralization enhance rate enamel remineralization . An in-situ Surface Micro-hardness ( SMH ) test widely use evaluate enamel demineralization remineralization caries process . The aim study evaluate efficacy toothpaste formulation contain fluoride different source [ sodium fluoride ( NaF ) sodium monofluorophosphate ( NaMFP ) ] use situ caries model .</detailed_description>
