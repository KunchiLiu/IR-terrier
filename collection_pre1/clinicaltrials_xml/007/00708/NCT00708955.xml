Objectives : The primary objective protocol provide reservoir patient enrollment new research protocol throughout NEI laboratory . Evaluating treat participant allow NEI specialist maintain expertise gain additional knowledge course various eye disorder . The information obtain allow evaluation standard treatment study eye disease . This understanding may lead idea future protocol . In case , blood biologic sample ( include tear fluid , urine , saliva , hair , stool cheek swab ) obtain future laboratory study . Study Population : The number participant enrol logical upper limit , set 5,000 patient ocular disease unaffected first-degree relative . Design : This observational natural history study multiple ocular disease progression physiology . Outcome Measures : No formal outcome measure ; however clinical assessment enrol participant use measure response standard treatment . In addition , DNA sample obtain may use identify verify causative mutation , may help establish pathogenic mechanism genotype-phenotype correlation .</detailed_description>
