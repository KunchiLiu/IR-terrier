	<brief_summary>To evaluate procedural , short long term clinical outcome TAXUS stent compare Cypher stent coronary artery ≥ 2.5 ≤ 3.75 mm reference vessel diameter lesion ≤ 46 mm ( visual observation ) routine clinical setting Japan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Japan-Drug Eluting Stents Evaluation ; Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In day , meta-analyses conduct large scale small scale study , conclusion yet state one stent , either Cypher stent TAXUS stent , superior . In specific disease condition diabetic patient , report Paclitaxel ( TAXUS stent ) suitable Sirolimus ( Cypher stent ) , due difference action mechanism drug . Since TAXUS stent recently approve Japan , decide conduct randomize multi-center comparative study compare Cypher stent TAXUS stent regard clinical endpoint ( target vessel failure 8 month ) . The study power show equivalence 2 stent patient , show superiority TAXUS stent diabetic patient population . In addition , select patient , quantitative coronary angiography , intravascular ultrasound , optical coherence tomography , angioscopy perform examine difference two stent closely .</detailed_description>
