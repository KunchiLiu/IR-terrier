	<brief_summary>This study involve treatment boceprevir placebo combination pegylated interferon alfa-2b ( PegIntron , PEG2b ) + Ribavirin ( RBV ) ( weight-based dosing [ WBD ] ) adult subject chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) genotype 1 demonstrated interferon responsiveness ( decrease hepatitis C virus RNA [ HCV-RNA ] viral load &gt; =2 log10 Week 12 undetectable HCV-RNA end treatment ) fail achieve sustain virologic response ( SVR ) prior treatment combination therapy peginterferon alpha RBV . This trial include three arm , one control arm ( PEG2b + RBV 48 week ) two experimental arm ( PEG2b + RBV + boceprevir ) . One experimental arm , Arm 3 , consist treatment three drug 44 week lead-in . The experimental arm , Arm 2 , consist three drug 32 week lead-in . Participants Arm 2 undetectable HCV-RNA Treatment Week 8 complete treatment point . Those undetectable HCV-RNA Treatment Week 8 receive additional 12 week PEG2b + RBV + boceprevir placebo . It hypothesize addition third active anti-HCV drug may lead rapid viral response therapy two drug , therefore , addition boceprevir PEG2b plus RBV therapy 4-week lead-in period may allow increase rate SVR shorter treatment duration ( population ) treatment peginterferon plus RBV alone .</brief_summary>
