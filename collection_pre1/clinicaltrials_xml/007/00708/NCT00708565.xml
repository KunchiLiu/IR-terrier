	<brief_title>Effects Iloprost Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction Exercise Capacity High Altitude</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three major pathway addition oxygen modulate pulmonary vascular tone : 1 ) nitric oxide , 2 ) endothelin , 3 ) prostacyclin . Considerable animal data support role prostacyclin pathway modulate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction . In human , prostacyclin analog important therapeutic agent treatment pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . Despite animal data human data PAH little information use iloprost relieve hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction healthy human . Inhaled iloprost ideal agent study prostacyclin pathway due short duration action ( 30-90 min ) elimination half-life 20-30 min . Individuals already participate Nepal Medex 2008 trip invite participate research . Participants healthy active female male , 18-80 year age , without know pregnancy liver disease , readily measurable tricuspid regurgitant velocity Doppler echocardiography . If possible , attempt identify cohort HAPE susceptible patient . Participants undergo evaluation sea level ( baseline ) high altitude . Baseline ( low altitude ) test perform Bangor , North Wales , UK , include evaluation pulmonary artery systolic pressure , cardiac output , oxygen saturation rest submaximal exercise inhalation iloprost . This strategy repeat altitude approximately 5000 meter Dhaulagiri region Nepal .</detailed_description>
