	<brief_title>Evaluation Plaque Fluid Fluoride Retention From Fluoride Toothpastes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topical fluoride wide variety delivery system prove clinically effective prevention dental caries . It generally agree fluoride anti-caries effect mainly decrease rate enamel demineralization enhance rate enamel remineralization . There general consensus level fluoride plaque fluid , may directly relate anti caries effect fluoride . Also , fluoride level oral fluid decrease rapidly topical fluoride application , mainly due dilute wash effect saliva follow periodic swallowing . To evaluate fluoride content , plaque sample collect interproximal surface posterior teeth participant use standardized approach . Plaque fluid fluoride calculate use micro analytical method comparison standard fluoride curve construct day analysis .</detailed_description>
