	<brief_title>Hexaminolevulinate ( HAL ) Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ( CIN ) Grade 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN1 ) cause persistent HPV infection may worse case develop cancer . In case virus infection lesion ( CIN1 ) regress spontaneously , must follow gynecological examination ensure normalization . If persistent disease worsen precancerous lesion ( CIN2-3 ) , usual treatment surgery , one remove tissue cervix CIN lesion . In research study evaluate new non-surgical treatment CIN1 use hexaminolevulinate ( HAL ) photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . HAL PDT combination medication specific type light activate drug . HAL PDT selectively remove CIN lesion preserve normal tissue , thus may alternative frequent gynecological consultation local surgery may undesirable side effect .</detailed_description>
