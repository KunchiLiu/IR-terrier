	<brief_title>Safety Study Clinical Immune Effects Phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE-4 ) Inhibitor Cutaneous Lupus Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Discoid cutaneous lupus common cutaneous manifestation lupus erythematosus , chronic , immune mediate disease unknown etiology . The immune process underlie cutaneous lupus remain largely unexplored , recent evidence suggest role dendritic cell ( DCs ) , type 1 interferon ( IFN ) Th1-type immune process . Treatment cutaneous lupus remain limited primarily anti-malarials , thalidomide effective secondary agent . However , side effect associate treatment potentially problematic chronic use . Phosphodiesterases ( PDE ) critical enzyme degrade cAMP . In particular , PDE type 4 ( PDE4 ) activity find inflammatory immune cell , include DCs . The immune modulator CC-10004 PDE4 inhibitor demonstrate low toxicity phase I II clinical study potential efficacy cutaneous lupus . CC-10004 well-tolerated , selective PDE4 inhibitor demonstrate inhibitory effect Th1-type cytokine inflammatory mediator development treatment inflammatory immune mediate condition . Prior study include pilot trial psoriasis exercise-induced asthma , result suggest clinical efficacy former study . This open label , pilot study 16 week duration explore clinical immune-modulating effect CC-10004 10 cutaneous discoid lupus patient . Patients meet study criterion receive drug 12 week , follow 4-week washout period . Study visit time point include week 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 16 , measure outcomes clinical , immunological safety parameter . To investigate early immunological change occur response treatment , also perform skin punch biopsy lesional site week 0 week 4 immunohistochemical molecular analysis .</detailed_description>
