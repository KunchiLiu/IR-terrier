	<brief_summary>Study Dose Rationale The safety profile clofarabine appear acceptable within target population study date clinical study summarize Section 2.3. clofarabine demonstrate anti-cancer activity inhibition DNA synthesis repair , induction apoptosis , possibly mechanism . The effect clofarabine DNA methylation determine . Numerous response observe treatment clofarabine heavily pre-treated relapsed/refractory patient ALL AML . Recently 2 small study conduct M.D . Anderson Cancer Center look use clofarabine treatment MDS.31 The first study randomize patient Bayesian fashion 15 vs. 30 mg/m2 give IV daily 5 day every 4 8 week . In 15 mg/m2 arm 3 7 patient complete remission accord International Working Group ( IWG ) 32 criterion response . In 30 mg/m2 arm , 2 6 patient complete remission 1 patient hematologic improvement accord IWG criterion . In second study , patient treat oral clofarabine dose 40 mg/m2 daily 5 day every 4 8 week . Two 7 patient hematologic improvement accord IWG criterion . The main toxicity trial prolong myelosuppression liver function abnormality . Preclinical animal model show increased clofarabine activity multiple different tumor repetitive daily dose prolonged period time.33 The use oral therapy advantageous treatment chronic malignancy MDS . Furthermore , base pre-clinical data mention daily repetitive dosing protracted period may provide increase efficacy . Since MDS patient elderly may tolerate aggressive therapy , schedule administration low dose oral clofarabine protract period may provide advantage increase efficacy without severe toxicity . The safety protract daily dosage oral clofarabine human determine . The dose scheme study therefore include dose escalate phase I component follow phase II component . The start dose 5 mg ( fix dose ) orally daily 10 day . This dose escalate cohort 3 patient tolerate maximal dose 15 mg ( fix dose ) orally 10 consecutive day . Note latter dose patient receive total 150 mg clofarabine per cycle , far low MD Anderson study oral clofarabine MDS whereby patient receive 200 mg/m2 per cycle . OBJECTIVES : Study Overview The purpose study determine efficacy toxicity Clofarabine administer orally low daily dose treatment myelodysplastic syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1 . Phase I : To determine MTD within plan dose range patient population ass toxicity oral clofarabine 2 . Phase II : To estimate overall response rate ( complete , partial hematologic improvement modify IWG criterion ) response low dose daily oral clofarabine patient high risk myelodysplastic syndrome chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( dysplastic type ) . Secondary Objectives 1 . To evaluate toxicity low dose daily oral clofarabine patient population . 2 . To determine time progression acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) MDS patient treat low dose daily oral clofarabine . 3 . To determine duration response , overall survival ( OS ) progression free survival ( PFS ) MDS patient treat low dose daily oral clofarabine . 4 . To determine effect low dose daily oral clofarabine global methylation patient MDS . 5 . To determine effect low dose daily oral clofarabine miRNA mRNA expression pattern patient MDS . Treatment Patients take Clofarabine mouth daily 10 day follow 18 day Clofarabine . This 28 day period time call one treatment cycle . After complete three cycle treatment bone marrow blood test do find MDS CMML respond treatment . If test show MDS CMML respond treatment continue take dose Clofarabine 3 cycle . If test show MDS CMML respond treatment dose Clofarabine increase continue schedule ( 10 day , 18 day ) 3 cycle . After 6 cycle patient bone marrow blood test do find MDS CMML respond treatment . If test show MDS CMML respond treatment dose Clofarabine increase continue schedule ( 10 day , 18 day ) 6 cycle . 5-3-11 Update : The phase I portion study close accrual . Based Phase I experience significant cytopenia observe 10 day consecutive oral clofarabine administration , Phase II dose determine 1 mg per day 7 consecutive day give 28 day cycle . The Phase II portion trial enroll 20 patient . Patients evaluate weekly basis toxicity . At completion cycle 3 within 1 week start cycle 4 , patient receive bone marrow aspirate biopsy addition complete blood count order evaluate response accord IWG criterion . Patients evidence response therapy stable disease continue dose schedule oral clofarabine . Bone marrow evaluation response obtain completion 6 12 cycle . If patient continue treatment cycle 12 bone marrow evaluation do discretion investigator . Treatment continue dose schedule indefinitely either disease progression , development unacceptable toxicity patient decides go study . Follow-up For protocol , patient , include discontinue protocol therapy early , follow response progression survival 5 year date registration . All patient must also follow completion protocol therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A bone marrow biopsy confirm diagnosis MDS CMML ( dysplastic subtype ) accord WHO criteria within 2 week registration . 1 . Patients must International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) , see Appendix D , score INT1 high study entry.35 Patients IPSS score INT1 5q deletion fail Lenalidomide therapy 5 % blast bone marrow platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm3 absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500/mm3 require therapy ( e.g . transfusion dependent ) . Patients CMML must WBC &lt; 12,000/mm3 document within 4 week prior study entry ( two set count 2 week apart take ) . 2 . Patients MDS fail relapse treatment one regimen hypomethylating agent ( 5Azacytidine Decitabine ) 2 prior therapy include 1 hypomethylating agent ... Patients CMML ( dysplastic subtype ) may enrol even receive prior therapy . 3 . Untreated patient ineligible unwilling undergo hypomethylating agent therapy enrol 4 . Age ≥ 18 year . 5 . Patients must ECOG performance status 0 2 . 6 . Provide sign write informed consent . 7 .
