	<brief_title>Efficacy Pioglitazone Bone Metabolism Postmenopausal Women With Impaired Fasting Glucose .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization estimate 30 % woman age 50 year ( postmenopausal ) osteoporosis accord definition Bone Mineral Density site 2.5 standard deviation mean young healthy adult woman . A know risk factor development osteoporosis fracture diabetes mellitus , correlation duration disease poor glycemic control . Pioglitazone thiazolidinedione develop Takeda Pharmaceuticals treatment type 2 diabetes . Preclinical study date bone effect thiazolidinediones clearly identify mechanism bone loss . While evidence increase bone fracture postmenopausal diabetic female treat thiazolidinedione , mechanism know . Initial study thiazolidinediones human focus short term exposure ( 12 14 week ) non-diabetic female . These study show acute change circulate bone marker bone density , question may represent bone metabolism state abnormal glucose metabolism . Impaired glucose tolerance identify risk factor develop type 2 diabetes , also high risk know complication diabetes . Examination effect thiazolidinediones bone metabolism IGT patient provide data patient abnormal glucose tolerance , without potential confounding effect oral hypoglycemic medication treat type 2 diabetes . The primary objective study evaluate effect pioglitazone bone mass metabolism postmenopausal woman impair fast glucose impair glucose tolerance . Total participation time study approximately 1 year six month .</detailed_description>
