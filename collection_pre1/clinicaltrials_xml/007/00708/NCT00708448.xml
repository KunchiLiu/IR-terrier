	<brief_summary>This exploratory clinical study design obtain pre-therapeutic imaging assessment use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image 21 patient Stage IIIB/IV recurrent non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) early post therapy assessment baseline various early time point ( 2 week 7 patient , 4 week 7 patient , 6 week 7 patient ) institution erlotinib ( anti-EGFR ) ( Tarceva ) bevacizumab ( anti-VEGF ) ( Avastin ) first-line treatment Stage IIIB/IV recurrent non-squamous NSCLC . The propose PET image blood derive biomarkers trial companion study approve therapeutic trial ( IRB # 24377 ) . The therapeutic trial erlotinib ( Tarceva ) bevacizumab ( Avastin ) first-line treatment Stage IIIB/IV recurrent lung cancer drug cost exceed $ 150,000 per patient/year ( study drug budget exceed $ 5 million ) fund study HCI HICCP , statewide trial network . The propose imaging study fund University Utah Synergy Grant Program . The clinical imaging biomarkers include assessment tumor metabolism [ Banrasch 1986 , Frauwirth 2002 , Garber 2006 , Kelloff 2005 , Pauwels 1998 , Semenza 2001 , Smith 1999 , Smith 2000 , Sokoloff 1977 , Warburg 1956 , Weber 1977A , Weber ] ( dynamic FDG-PET ) ; tumor proliferation [ Rasey 2002 , Shields 2001 , Shields 1998 , Vesselle 2002 , Schwartz 2003 ] ( dynamic FLT-PET ) ; tumor blood flow perfusion ( H215O-PET ) [ Lodge 2000 ] ; tumor blood volume distribution ( H215O -PET ) [ Lodge 2000 ] patient baseline patient one post therapy time point ( 2 week , 4 week , 6 week ) . The investigator hypothesize use set image derived biomarkers biomarkers blood predict response , either prior early time point would normally determine standard image technique , patient lung cancer receiving combine bevacizumab erlotinib .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Non- small cell lung cancer common cause cancer mortality United States [ Jermal , 2007 ] . Surgery curative patient stage I II disease chemoradiation curative intent administer select patient stage III disease set adequate performance status , minimal comorbid disease absence weight loss . Adjuvant therapy improve survival , relapse rate high may approach 80 % subset patient presume `` curable disease '' . Consequently , 85 % patient diagnose NSCLC ultimately die uncontrolled systemic disease . Systemic chemotherapy treatment metastatic disease , offer palliative benefit , improve survival , substantial side effect , curative . Improved systemic therapy great therapeutic index due great efficacy few side effect sorely need . Bevacizumab and/or erlotinib demonstrate feature . Therapeutic Drugs ( Erlotinib Bevacizumab ) The therapeutic trial , molecular image serum biomarker trial compliment , study combination erlotinib bevacizumab first-line treatment patient non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . This first ever study conventional chemotherapy use first-line treatment NSCLC . Both erlotinib , single agent chemotherapy progression [ Shepherd 2005 ] , bevacizumab , combination chemotherapy [ Sandler 2006 ] , approve treatment metastatic NSCLC . This multi-center trial via Huntsman Cancer Institute - Intermountain Cancer Care Program , phase II , single stage , erlotinib ( 150 mg/day ) bevacizumab ( 15 mg/kg IV every 21 day ) patient non-squamous , NSCLC without brain metastasis significant hemoptysis receive conventional chemotherapy treatment systemic relapsed disease . Study treatment continue symptomatic objective progression . Patients progress combination subsequently receive conventional chemotherapy bevacizumab discretion patient treat physician . The study follow Data Safety Monitoring Committee HCI enroll 40 patient . An interim safety analysis schedule 20 patient accrue . For purpose define response follow criterion use target lesion : complete response—the disappearance target lesion ; partial response—at least 30 % decrease sum long diameter target lesion , take reference baseline sum long diameter ; progressive disease—at least 20 % increase sum long diameter target lesion , take reference small sum long diameter record since treatment start appearance one new lesion ; stable disease—neither sufficient shrinkage qualify partial response sufficient increase qualify progressive disease , take reference small sum long diameter since treatment start . The primary exploratory objective study : - Provide reliable validated cadre PET image derive biomarkers serum derive biomarkers yield well understanding : 1 ) early clinical benefit Avastin Tarceva therapy , 2 ) efficacy Avastin Tarceva therapy , 3 ) prognosis long term outcome . - Reveal detailed understanding : ( 1 ) vivo biologic mechanism Avastin Tarceva lung cancer ( 2 ) information particular functional imaging assay genomic biomarker profile see treated patient . - Reveal detailed understanding combination molecular imaging derive biomarkers combination gene expression profiles/biomarkers potentially useful physician decision make explanation efficacy outcomes patient cancer . - Predict patient may benefit combined Avastin Tarceva therapy . - Determine early course treatment whether Avastin Tarceva efficacious whether image derive biomarkers combination blood derive biomarkers use future patient types malignancy predict early response efficacy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All subject must enrol therapeutic trial ( IRB # 24377 ) nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treat combined erlotinib ( Tarceva ) ( 150 mg/day ) bevacizumab ( Avastin ) ( 15mg/kg q 21 day ) first line therapy . 2 . Adults must radiological evidence Stage IIIB/IV recurrent nonsquamous nonsmall cell carcinoma . The Stage IIIB/IV Recurrent lesion must location include large arterial vessel allow determination H215O arterial input function . A previous histological diagnosis NSCLC would require prior institution therapy . Only clinically indicate biopsy and/or surgery determination Stage IIIB/IV recurrent disease do surgery incidental inclusion protocol . 3 . Patients must 18 year old inclusion study . Since experience [ F18 ] FLT child would inappropriate study individual age 18 safety data available . 4 . After entry study , patient expect follow least 2 month part standard care . 5 . All patient , legal guardian , must sign write informed consent HIPAA authorization accordance institutional guideline . 6 . The patient , female , must postmenopausal minimum one year surgically sterile , one follow method birth control minimum one month prior entry study : IUD , oral contraceptive , DepoProvera Norplant . These criterion waive discretion investigator patient 's tumor consider life threaten one month wait require best interest patient . Negative pregnancy test accept . 7 . Pretreatment laboratory test patient receive [ F18 ] FLT must perform within 21 day prior study entry . These must less 4 time upper low limit range respective laboratory test . The patient Stage IIIB/IV recurrent NSCLC therefore many routine laboratory test may within typical normal range . Using factor 4 time upper low value normal range laboratory test assure ability recruit patient maintain safety . In instance value 4X normal range would inappropriate inclusion ( prothrombin time partial thromboplastin time ) value 2.5X use two laboratory test . In instance prothrombin time partial thromboplastin time great 2.5X upper limit normal patient would enrol . The 4X value use laboratory value except prothrombin time partial thromboplastin time 2.5 time upper low limit normal ( Appendix E , [ F18 ] FLT Laboratory Study Results ) . A negative serum pregnancy test require within 2 day prior PET study . 8 . Pretreatment radiological clinical scans/studies ( Gd enhance MRI CT document Stage IIIB/IV recurrent NSCLC ) must perform within 30 day study entry . 1 . Patients receive erlotinib ( Tarceva ) ( 150 mg/day ) bevacizumab ( Avastin ) ( 15mg/kg q 21 day ) part therapeutic trial . Enrollment may occur patient meet enrollment criterion therapeutic trial 2 . Patients know allergic hypersensitivity reaction previously administer radiopharmaceutical . Patients significant drug allergy autoimmune disease may enrol Investigator 's discretion . 3 . Patients pregnant lactate suspect might pregnant . 4 . Adult patient require monitored anesthesia PET scanning . 5 . HIV positive patient due previous toxicity note FLT . 6 . Claustrophobia inability remain stationary within PET scanner 90 minute .</criteria>
