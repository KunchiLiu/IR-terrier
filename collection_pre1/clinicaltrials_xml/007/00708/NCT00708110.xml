	<criteria>Male female &gt; /18 &lt; / 65 year age . A female subject eligible participate nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation , hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method Section 8.1 wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Male subject must agree use one contraception method list Section 8.1 . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication 14 day last dose study drug . CD4+ cell count &gt; / 100 cells/mm3 . Documented HIV1 infection screen plasma HIV1 RNA &gt; / 5000 copies/mL . No current antiretroviral therapy receive 12 week prior first dose . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance The subject positive prestudy drug screen . Drugs screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , PCP . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . In addition , heparin use PK sample , subject history sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia enrol . Prior treatment integrase inhibitor ( &gt; 1 dose ) . Treatment radiation therapy cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent within 30 day study drug administration anticipate need treatment within study . Treatment immunomodulating agent ( systemic corticosteroid , interleukin , interferon ) agent know antiHIV activity ( hydroxyurea foscarnet ) within 30 day study drug administration Treatment vaccine within 30 day prior receive study medication . Use multivitamins antacid within 24 hour prior first dose investigational product . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month screen visit define : average weekly intake &gt; 14 drinks/week men &gt; 7 drinks/week woman . One drink equivalent ( 12 g alcohol ) = 5 ounce ( 150 ml ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 ml ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 ml ) 80 proof distil spirit . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Pregnant female determine positive urine/serum hCG test screen prior dosing . Lactating female . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol . Any condition ( include alcohol drug abuse ) , opinion investigator , could interfere subject 's ability comply dose schedule protocol evaluation might compromise safety subject . An active Center Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) Category C disease [ see Appendix 1 ] , except cutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma require systemic therapy trial . History clinically relevant pancreatitis hepatitis within previous 6 month . Subjects preexist condition interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility , hepatic and/or renal function , could interfere absorption , metabolism , and/or excretion study drug . Has positive screening Hepatitis B surface antigen ; positive screening hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody detectable HCV ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) subsequent test . If hepatitis C antibody positive HCV RNA undetectable , subject may include study . Inadequate renal function Screening , define either serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≤ 50 mL/min . A single repeat serum creatinine allow determine eligibility . Any acute laboratory abnormality screen , opinion investigator , preclude subject 's participation study investigational compound . Any grade 4 laboratory abnormality screen , exception CPK , exclude subject study participation unless investigator provide compel explanation laboratory result ( ) assent sponsor . A single repeat allow eligibility determination . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≥ 3x time upper limit normal . A single repeat ALT and/or AST allow eligibility determination . Exclusion Criteria Screening ECG ( A single repeat allow eligibility determination ) :</criteria>
