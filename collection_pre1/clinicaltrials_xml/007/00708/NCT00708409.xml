	<brief_title>Long-Term Follow-up After Autograft Aortic Valve Procedure ( Ross Operation )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient aortic valve disease require surgical treatment several option available . In instance valve repair , however replacement valve usually necessary . The choice particular aortic valve replacement procedure influence several inter-related factor ( e.g . prosthesis , procedure , patient age , concomitant disease , atrial fibrillation , center ` experience , preference refer cardiologist , attend surgeon patient ) . Often , one type prosthesis seem suitable individual patient , whereby decision particular prosthesis make rather arbitrarily . With current knowledge outcome patient aortic valve replacement different type prosthesis ( pulmonary autograft accord Ross , bioprosthesis , mechanical heart valve ) , specific recommendation give . This especially true autograft , since long-term outcome yet available clinical practice . In 2001 German Ross Registry establish work group . Although Ross procedure expect lifelong solution aortic valve disease , seem appropriate make collaborative effort establish multicenter long term follow-up study examine longitudinal clinical outcome associated procedure , well , attempt resolve identify many technical consideration necessary successful execution procedure . With issue mind , already included 1400 Ross operate patient nine participate center registry fourteen year follow-up . The first release annual report present February 2004 . The main limitation Registry limit maximal time span follow-up keep mind next year follow-up important evaluate Ross procedure possible degeneration aortic valve substitute may occur . Therefore long-term observation require .</detailed_description>
