	<brief_summary>Age relate macular degeneration ( AMD ) multifactorial disease strong genetic component . Most importantly genetic polymorphism gene encode complement factor H ( CFH ) recently identify highly associate increase risk develop AMD . This Tyr402His polymorphism locate chromosome 1q31 implicated play role development disease . Given know impaired regulation choroidal vascular tone present patient AMD , current study seek investigate whether Tyr402His polymorphism associate alter choroidal autoregulation healthy subject . For purpose total 100 healthy volunteer include order test hypothesis impair regulation choroidal blood flow present subject homozygous Tyr402His variant .</brief_summary>
