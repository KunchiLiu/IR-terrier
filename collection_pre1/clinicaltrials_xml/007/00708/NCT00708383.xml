	<brief_summary>Human conception vivo occur complex milieu include protein . It speculate addition protein complex human serum albumin culture medium may improve IVF outcome . Whether expense , labor risk add additional human-derived protein IVF medium warrant question unanswered . Patients , undergo routine IVF ICSI , assign one two treatment group randomize , prospective clinical trial . Embryos culture either medium supplement human serum albumin ( HSA ) solitary protein supplement medium supplement HSA + SSS 2-PN stage time embryo transfer . Clinical endpoint monitor implantation rate , clinical pregnancy rate live birth rate . It expect supplementation commercial embryo culture medium contain HSA complex protein source , SSS , result overall increase implantation , clinical pregnancy , live birth rate . In balance , protein enrichment medium may represent opportunity simultaneously increase live birth rate reduce incidence multiple gestation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose comparison determine best two protein source embryo culture medium future use Presbyterian Assisted Reproductive Technology Services ( ARTS ) Program . Background : For embryo grow incubator , protein source essential embryo culture medium . Currently , HSA ( simple protein ) use sole protein source embryo culture medium Presbyterian ARTS laboratory . Literature suggest add globulin , e.g . SSS ( increase complexity protein source ) culture medium , resultant embryo may better quality increase chance produce pregnancy . HSA and/or SSS routinely use standard protein source commercial human IVF program . Both source proteins FDA approve use human embryo culture medium . The goal switch good protein source ( exist HSA vs. complex SSS ) , without compromise establish pregnancy rate . To responsibly , Presbyterian ARTS Program feel introduce potential improve formulation ( exist culture medium supplement SSS ) compare randomize , prospective way exist culture system ( exist culture medium supplement HSA ) . Project Summary : Study design : The study conduct prospective , randomized way . Two treatment group consider : 1 ) culture medium supplement HSA 2 ) Culture medium supplement SSS . To allow well-documented decline pregnancy rate increase age , patient randomize within 4 age group 7 physician within treatment ( block age physician within treatment ) . The age group : donor egg ; &lt; 35 year ; 35 37 year ; 38 40 year determine day egg retrieval . Endpoints Measured : The endpoint measure embryo cryopreservation-biochemical pregnancy- , clinical pregnancy- , ongoing pregnancy- , live birth- embryo implantation rate . Number Patients Study : To detect difference 10 % pregnancy rate , 150 patient include treatment group . With current patient volume , take less one year complete study . Differences implantation rate may detect early ( embryos transfer patient enrol ) . Should significance difference pregnancy rate become evident full number patient enrol , study may terminate . Study Location : The study conduct simultaneously ARTS facility Presbyterian Hospital Dallas Presbyterian Hospital Plano . Criteria Inclusion Subjects : All patient undergo first IVF cycle donor oocyte cycle eligible participate laboratory comparison . The egg may fertilize conventional IVF methodology use intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) . When perform ICSI , ejaculate sperm must use . Patients use egg must 40 year age young day egg retrieval . The Presbyterian Hospital ARTS Program perform ~900 commercial egg retrieval 2000 . Of , ~500 would meet inclusion criterion study . Criteria Exclusion Subjects : To reduce tremendous patient variability see infertile patient population , first cycle patient 40 year age young day egg retrieval participate . Sources Research Material : Patients enrol study regular patient pool present Presbyterian ARTS Program treatment infertility . Data collect specifically research purpose . Data use collected ARTS patient , regardless participation study . Recruitment Subjects : Subjects study recruit regular patient pool present ARTS Program treatment infertility . Patients meet inclusion criterion study identify prospectively . Information study include routine , biweekly , group laboratory nurse orientation session . Patients meet inclusion criterion study present study consent along regular IVF consent ask consider join study . The attend physician , physician 's nurse , ARTS Scientific Director , attend embryologist ARTS nurse may approach patient . Potential Risks : Patients consent comparison allow embryo culture either standard HSA-supplemented embryo culture medium embryo culture medium supplement SSS . HSA-supplemented culture medium current standard program . SSS-supplemented medium use routinely many commercial IVF-programs cryopreservation embryo Presbyterian ARTS Program . Both HSA SSS FDA approve use human embryo culture medium . Culture condition ingredient apply experimental . The embryo expose procedure substance consider industry standard human IVF laboratory . To best knowledge Presbyterian Hospital ARTS Program , publish literature suggest SSS-supplemented culture medium may better rather bad condition propose study . However , HSA SSS compare control , randomized way suggest comparison , ARTS Program guarantee pregnancy outcome equivalent treatment group ( HSA vs. SSS ) . Therefore , randomize , patient may include group low success rate . Special Precautions : If become clear early study SSS treatment outcome inferior current culture system ( HSA ) place , study discontinue . Procedures Maintain Confidentiality : No additional information collect study patient otherwise collect ARTS patient . Data collect treated way ARTS patient . The ARTS Scientific Director , aid 6 embryologist keep record number patient enrol study , randomization procedure , treatment allocation outcome endpoint measure treatment . Nursing administrative personnel access treatment-specific data . The treatment allocation sheet keep two IVF laboratory . Only embryologists access laboratory . The executed consent form treat like consent pertain IVF cycle file patient 's chart consent section . Copies make patient . Potential Benefits : The patient directly involve study may benefit treatment-group provide high pregnancy rate current standard treatment protocol ( HSA ) . For future ARTS patient , information obtain study may determine good protein source equivalency protein source use culture medium ARTS laboratory allow best possible pregnancy rate . Only program patient volume ability examine control manner . Risk/Benefit Assessment : The protein compare FDA approve use human embryo culture medium . Furthermore , industry-standard culture condition methodology use throughout study period . Literature suggest embryo quality pregnancy outcome improve rather deteriorate increase complexity protein source . The Presbyterian ARTS Program perceive risk minimal . This responsible way introduce new variable potential benefit ARTS IVF laboratory without risk establish , successful embryo culture protocol . By constantly seek way improve pregnancy rate patient , Presbyterian ARTS Program run risk become stagnant , outdated IVF program . The ability compare variable ( protein source ) randomize , prospective way invaluable ARTS community general . The researcher guarantee outcome treatment group equivalent . Therefore , possible patient may include treatment group low success rate .</detailed_description>
