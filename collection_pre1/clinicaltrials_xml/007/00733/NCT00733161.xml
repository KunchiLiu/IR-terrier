	<brief_title>Effect Passive Exercise Systemic Endothelial Function Elderly Patients With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endothelial function know impaired patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) impair endothelial function report associate increased mortality risk subject . Although systemic exercise training demonstrate improve endothelial dysfunction patient CHF , elderly patient severely impaired exercise capacity could engage usual exercise training use ordinal ergometer . Those patient able join stretch light resistance training . On hand , passive pedal use strength ergometer report useful patient severely impaired exercise capacity , safety efficacy passive pedal endothelial function old patient CHF previously report .</detailed_description>
