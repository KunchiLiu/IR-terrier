	<brief_summary>The primary objective investigation compare precision long leg alignment achieve two type procedure . The secondary objective investigation : Compare accuracy long leg alignment achieve two type procedure . Compare number optimal implantation achieve two type procedure . Compare clinical performance knee replacement subject undergone one two type procedure . Compare functional outcome achieve subject undergone one two type procedure . Compare interface radiographic appearance 5 year post-operatively two type procedure . Compare accuracy precision long leg alignment achieve two type procedure 5 year post-operatively , i.e. , final follow-up also change accuracy precision final follow-up baseline . Compare Adverse Events experience subject undergone two type procedure .</brief_summary>
