	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle ( Nab-paclitaxel ) formulation together bevacizumab follow bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride work treat patient metastatic breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , prevent cancer growth block ability cancer cell grow spread . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . This trial evaluate maintenance treatment erlotinib bevacizumab Nab-paclitaxel bevacizumab may control cancer growth biologic therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation Bevacizumab Followed By Bevacizumab Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Progression free survival . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Response rate . II . Overall survival . III . Safety toxicity . IV . Exploratory biomarkers assess potential predictor response treatment include : expression epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) secrete protein acidic rich cysteine ( SPARC ) primary tumor change level circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients achieve complete response , partial response , stable disease completion induction therapy receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every 14 21 day erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow per physician discretion .</detailed_description>
