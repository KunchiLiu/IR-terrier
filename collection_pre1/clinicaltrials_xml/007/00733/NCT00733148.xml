	<brief_summary>The EU fund project CLINICIP ( Closed Loop Insulin Infusion Critically Ill Patients ) aim develop low-risk monitoring control device allow maintain metabolic control intensive care unit . A system develop comprise three subsystem : body interface delivery biofluids , biosensors determination glucose concentration biofluids adaptive control algorithm generate advice thus represent decision support system respect insulin infusion rate establish glycaemic control critically ill patient . Within close loop system , intensified insulin treatment make use calculation lead external regulation glucose . It aim study evaluate correlation arterial blood glucose concentration interstitial fluid glucose concentration post surgery patient Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . Interstitial fluid glucose concentration base microdialysis subcutaneous adipose tissue calculate use ionic reference technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial include screen visit ( V1 ) monitoring visit ( V2 ) follow-up assessment . Visit 1 performed performance surgery obtain informed consent ass patient eligibility . At Visit 2 monitoring visit surgery ) arterial blood glucose value monitor subcutaneous sample ISF microdialysis glucose determination perform . Visit 2 last admittance ICU 48 hour . In follow-up assessment , two week end visit 2 , clinical relevant data two week period visit 2 collect .</detailed_description>
