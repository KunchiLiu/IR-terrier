	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Intravenous 131I-TM601 Adult Patients With Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , Phase 1/2 study evaluate use multiple intravenous dos 131I-TM601 adult patient progressive and/or recurrent malignant melanoma ( Stage IIIc IV ) measurable disease fail first line/standard therapy . The study conduct 2 phase . During first , Dose Escalation Phase , eligible patient wil assign group 3-6 ( depend upon treatment response see dose ) dose cohort 2-5 weekly IV dose 131I-TM601 . Escalation next high dose Dose Escalation Phase dependent upon demonstrate tolerance previous dose group . In second , Efficacy Phase , patient treat Maximum Tolerated Dose determine Dose Escalation Phase . Prior initiate treatment , patient administer single image dose 131I-TM601 , IV , Imaging Dose evaluate tumor uptake . Only patient demonstrate tumor uptake remain study . Patients study phase safety parameter evaluate continuously throughout study . Clinical response 131I-TM601 assessed study patient 28 day follow final study dose , 2-month interval , start 3 month follow first study dose ( first year follow-up ) , finally 3-month interval thereafter disease progression .</detailed_description>
