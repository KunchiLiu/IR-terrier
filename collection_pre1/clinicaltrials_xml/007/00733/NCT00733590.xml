	<brief_summary>The overall hypothesis study subtle interaction structural ( substrate ) functional ( trigger ) abnormalities heart , genetically-determined , used identify patient high risk sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) . Such information may use good define patient likely benefit replacement internal defibrillator ( ICD ) . The prospective , observational study enroll , categorize follow patient receive ICD pulse generator replacement primary prevention SCD ( PROSe-ICD ) establish : 1. gain well understanding biological mechanism predispose SCD 2. develop readily determine clinical , electrocardiographic , genetic blood protein marker identify patient increase risk die suddenly</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Observational Study ICD Sudden Cardiac Death Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROSe-ICD multicenter prospective cohort study patient undergo ICD implantation primary prevention SCD , design compare patient sustain SCD ( measure appropriate ICD fire rapid VT VF ) . The cohort observational study consist patient cardiomyopathy ICD implant primary SCD prevention accord recent trial ( MADIT II , SCD-HeFT , DEFINITE ) practice guideline . Patients follow longitudinally clinical , ECG , genomic proteomic marker index event . The primary outcome variable appropriate adjudicate ICD fire rapid ventricular tachycardia fibrillation . The study standardize initial therapeutic ICD setting , reflect current standard care rather intervention , definition study cohort consist patient without history malignant arrhythmia , ICD function simply defibrillator rather complex device employ anti-tachycardia pacing tiered therapy . In order facilitate identification rhythm prompt ICD therapy , program include far field ventricular electrogram storage . For patient firing ( appropriate ) , subsequent clinical care ( include drug device prescription ) manage independently clinical attend electrophysiologist/cardiologist accord local standard care , unaffected study protocol . For safety reason , clinically-significant data ( symptomatic complaint document episode ventricular arrhythmia ) obtain study promptly communicate clinical attend physician telephone writing . After informed consent , patient undergo initial history examination conduct attending electrophysiologist . Thereafter , patient generally see ICD nurse every 3 month evaluate purpose study every six month . The physician and/or nurse record variables show Table D1 paper form directly REDCap , web-based entry form . At routine clinic visit ( Q 3 month interval ) ICD interrogate episode ventricular tachycardia last &gt; 10 beat cycle length &lt; 400 m , ventricular fibrillation , anti-tachycardia pacing ICD therapy record . If ventricular arrhythmia detect blood drawn digital ECG perform described 6 month follow visit . Further evaluation treatment arrhythmia manage independently clinical attend physician , notify arrhythmia telephone , write confirmation documentation . At alternate visit ( every 6 month ) patient evaluate attend electrophysiologist , 60cc blood sample obtain , 5-minute digital ECG , additional laboratory diagnostic testing perform clinically indicate . Data clinical event ( admission MI/ACS , admission CHF , diagnostic angiography , revascularization , ICD device revision ) collect medical record review . Patients follow minimum ten year death , cardiac transplantation ventricular assist device implantation . A patient experience appropriate ICD firing consider meet primary endpoint study continue follow , particularly development adverse event . A clinical event committee comprise three experienced electrophysiologists , investigator study Hopkins Reynolds Center , adjudicate whether ICD firing appropriate whether episode VT/VF relate ischemia , base report device interrogation clinical documentation.The event committee also adjudicate death study cardiac non-cardiac sudden non-sudden review medical record , record interview family friends ICD interrogation . Death within one hour symptom onset and/or VT/VF ICD interrogation correct device consider SCD . All death adjudicate non-sudden include terminal hospice chronic care patient whose ICD program .</detailed_description>
