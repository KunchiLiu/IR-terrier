	<brief_summary>Changes chelation treatment transfusion practice , past two decade , dramatically improve prognosis thalassemia major patients.Deferiprone ( DFP ) compare deferoxamine ( DFO ) , use different schedule treatment , majority 13 clinical trial publish 1990 2008.No statistically significant difference show two intervention , , 18 month treatment.Three randomise trial compare sequential DFP-DFO treatment versus DFO alone report controversial result could due small sample size short treatment duration . In fact , trial treatment duration longer 18 months15 , report mortality , adverse event , serum ferritin concentration , well cost far publish . This long-term sequential DFP-DFO treatment versus DFP alone treatment trial conduct assess impact chelation treatment serum ferritin concentration , mortality , adverse event , cost thalassemia major patient .</brief_summary>
