	<brief_summary>There many different treatment doctor recommend patient IC/PBS . Only research study do evaluate treatment give patient . Treatment choice two type : drug therapy non-drug therapy . The two treatment use study non-drug therapy type . One treatment use study call Myofascial Tissue Manipulation . This kind physical therapy design work specific muscle tissue layer particular part body . In study , treatment focus area around pelvis pelvic floor . The treatment involve physical therapist 's use hand finger target specific muscle tissue locate within pelvis , rectum , and/or vagina ( pelvic floor ) well muscle layer tissue abdomen leg . The treatment use study Global Therapeutic Massage . This treatment involve physical therapist 's use classic Western body massage technique muscle arm , leg , hand , neck , shoulder , back , stomach , buttock , foot create overall feeling well . The purpose research study find Pelvic Physical Therapy safe effective treating symptom woman interstitial cystitis compare full body therapeutic massage . This study also measure lasting effect treatment 3 month last study treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Urologic Pelvic Pain Syndromes ( UPPS ) characterize pelvic pain concurrent urinary symptom . Broadly , UPPS comprise Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome ( IC/PBS ) men woman , Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome ( CP/CPPS ) men , although focus protocol exclusively woman IC/PBS . Interstitial Cystitis ( IC ) debilitate bladder disorder characterize urinary urgency , frequency , pain . The presentation symptoms quite variable among patient , suggest IC multi-factorial syndrome several propose etiology , may interrelated.1 Painful Bladder Syndrome ( PBS ) , define International Continence Society , `` complaint suprapubic pain related bladder filling , accompany symptom , increase daytime night-time frequency , absence proven urinary infection obvious pathology . 2 '' PBS clinical description disease base patient 's symptom depend urodynamic cystoscopic finding . These symptom may relate interstitial cystitis , although diagnostic criterion still lack entity , relationship PBS interstitial cystitis clear . For clarity compliance current nomenclature , protocol use term IC/PBS . As many chronic pain disorder , IC/PBS poorly understand , poorly characterize , treatment mostly empirical unsatisfactory . Several propose etiologic theory include ( 1 ) increase bladder epithelial permeability , ( 2 ) activation bladder mast cell , ( 3 ) allergic autoimmune process , ( 4 ) toxic substance ( ) urine , ( 5 ) occult infection , ( 6 ) neuropathic change , ( 7 ) neurogenic inflammation . However , none mechanism conclusively show responsible IC/PBS . Estimates prevalence syndrome vary widely . In 1990 interstitial cystitis ( IC ) think affect many 500,000 U.S. citizen , 25 % patient age 25.3 More recently however , use expand definition PBS exceed 10 million.4 Quality life IC/PBS bad end stage renal disease.5 The recent pilot study manual physical therapy Urologic Pelvic Pain demonstrate feasibility recruitment , promise benefit myofascial tissue manipulation ( MTM ) ( ref manuscript # 1 ) . In pilot study , 47 participant recruit six center prior expertise MTM . Of 47 participant , 24 female IC/PBS , 23 male -- 2 IC/PBS 21 CP/CPPS . Motivated promising finding pilot study , protocol aim investigate whether initial result generalizable expanded phase 3 clinical trial , include therapist center . However , due gender-specific finding pilot study , limited resource available , protocol focus replicate initial pilot study exclusively woman IC/PBS . Although pain IC/PBS poorly understood , almost clinician agree almost always chronic tension tenderness pelvic floor musculature present UPPS patients,8-10 possible myofascial abnormality contribute significantly pain IC/PBS . For example , Hetrick et al11 compare surface EMG signal men CPPS men without chronic pain , find great EMG instability men CPPS , along increase baseline tonicity , instability lower voluntary endurance contraction amplitude . Whether musculoskeletal abnormality abdominal wall pelvic floor musculature find IC/PBS sufferer represent primary secondary phenomenon remain unknown . It possible pelvic visceral pain lead chronic contraction regional skeletal musculature , lead overuse injury pain . It also possible primary pelvic myofascial problem lead painful weakened pelvic floor musculature , also function poorly inhibit urgency associate bladder filling . Our prior study manual physical therapy suggest benefit MTM GTM . Translation office practice research set apparently successful center participate first trial . We propose expand number treat therapist include 11 study center , order determine whether result first trial generalize , least research setting . However , due gender-specific finding , expand replication study focus exclusively woman IC/PBS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant sign dated appropriate Informed Consent document . Female participant â‰¥ 18 year age . Currently use approve method birth control , surgically sterile , nonchild bearing age menstrual period past year . Participant clinical diagnosis IC/PBS opinion investigator . Participant IC/PBS report bladder pain/discomfort score 3 great 010 Likert scale previous four week . This bladder pain/discomfort criterion must meet two baseline screen visit report participant . Participant IC/PBS report symptom score abnormal urinary frequency 3 great 010 Likert scale previous four week . This frequency criterion must meet two baseline screen visit , report participant . Participant symptoms discomfort pain pelvic region least three ( 3 ) month period within last six ( 6 ) month . Current symptoms present le 3 year . If similar symptom present past , must completely resolve least one year prior onset current symptom . Participant previously undergo least one course therapy ( physical therapy ) symptom . Presence tenderness/pain palpation find physician one pelvic floor musculature domains first baseline screen visit physical examination confirm physical therapist screen visit 2 . Presence tenderness/pain define mild , moderate severe find physician visit 1 physical therapist visit 2 . The pelvic floor musculature domain define : anterior posterior levator muscle , obturator internus muscle urogenital diaphragm ( bulbospongiosus , superficial transverse perinei , ischiocavernosus , central tendon/perineal body ) . The assessment tenderness/pain Visits 1 2 need identical severity location order participant eligible . Participant relevant , painful scar low abdominal wall , opinion study physician physical therapist , unlikely respond physical therapy without adjuvant therapy injection /needling . A positive urine culture ( define &gt; 100,000 CFU/ml ) exclusionary . A negative urine culture within 1 month study enrollment acceptable . Participant unable tolerate insertion one two vaginal examine finger ( e.g . vulvar allodynia ) , one rectal examining finger . Participant prior course physical therapy include manual therapy connective tissue manipulation physical therapist symptom . Prior treatment therapist biofeedback , electrical stimulation , pelvic floor exercise exclusionary . Participant relevant neurologic disorder affect bladder and/or neuromuscular function opinion investigator . Participant active urethral ureteral calculus , urethral diverticulum . Participant history pelvic radiation therapy , tuberculous cystitis , bladder cancer , carcinoma situ , urethral cancer . Participant has/reports severe debilitate urgent concurrent medical condition . Participant potentially significant pelvic pathology abnormality examination prior imaging , include prolapse beyond hymenal ring , pelvic mass , etc . could cause contribute clinical symptom require treatment . Participant unlikely compliant due unmanaged medical psychological condition , include neurological , psychological speech /language problem interfere ability complete study . Participant imminent change residence social factor could compromise compliance protocol . Pregnancy refusal medically approved/reliable birth control woman childbearing potential .
