	<brief_summary>Current antipsychotic limited effect two core symptom schizophrenia , negative symptom cognitive deficit . Minocycline second-generation tetracycline beneficial effect various neurological disorder . Recent finding animal model human case-reports suggest potential treatment symptom schizophrenia . The current study aim examine efficacy minocycline add-on treatment alleviate negative cognitive symptom early-phase schizophrenia . The study utilize longitudinal double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled design patient follow six-months . Early-phase schizophrenia patient recruit randomly allocate minocycline placebo treatment ( 2:1 ratio ; 200 mg/day ) . The primary outcome measure Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) assessment executive function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia disorder characterize disturbance perception , think , volition , socialization , psychomotor behavior sense self . Although patient suffer schizophrenia start point relative normalcy subtle impairment , follow formal onset patient experience , degree , clinical deterioration . This deterioration manifest development increase severity persistence psychotic negative symptom , cognitive impairment , diminish social functional capacity . The underlying cause clinical deterioration know , generally attribute progression illness associate period active positive symptom . The deterioration occur primarily early stage illness generally confine first 5 year onset . It also progress linear fashion . Rather , period , patient stabilize level persistent symptom impair social vocational function . Despite heterogeneity symptom among patient variability within patient across episode , two distinct pattern discern long-term catamnestic study schizophrenia patient . First , negative symptom tend less common severe early stage illness increase prevalence severity later stage . In early stage positive symptom likely dominate clinical picture . Second , within constellation positive symptom , form systematized delusion hallucination common early stage illness , whereas think disorganization , inappropriate affect , motor symptom common later stag illness . Both MRI MRS offer evidence , consistent neurodegenerative pathologic process schizophrenia occur primarily exclusively early stage illness . Recent MRI study first-episode childhood-onset schizophrenia sample use rigorous standardize method find cortical gray matter ventricular system volume change . The finding volume reduction cortical gray matter increase ventricular system volume describe consistent process cause pathomorphologic progression neurodegeneration Investigators consider role molecular mechanism neuropathology schizophrenia . In context , proponent neurodegenerative theory suggest absence gliosis evidence cell degeneration could due fact pathophysiology involve grade apoptosis rather fulminant necrotic process . Apoptosis evanescent difficult detect histopathologically process unfolds . Studies show various neurochemical event synapse induce apoptosis . Such triggering action include excessive glutamate stimulation , calcium influx reactive oxygen specie induce caspase activation dendrite . Local activation caspase initiate apoptotic cascade spread cell body remain localized produce neurodegenerative synapse loss synaptic remodeling . The reduced size increase density neuron , absence decrease number neuron glia decreased cortical thickness , indicate cell process synaptic connection reduce schizophrenia . This consistent report decrease concentration synaptic protein ( e.g. , synaptophysin ) . These cell process synapsis could lose consequence neurochemically mediate ( dopamine and/or glutamate ) synaptic apoptosis would compromise cell function alter brain morphology without , however , produce serious cell injury ( thus induce glial reaction ) . Although author suggest pharmacologic treatment suppresses symptoms schizophrenia alter course illness potential progression , others suggest antipsychotic drug fact ameliorate pathophysiologic process cause psychotic symptom lead clinical deterioration . Moreover , maintenance treatment study demonstrate prophylactic effect antipsychotic drug prevent relapse ; treatment , , may responsible mitigate course illness produce favorable outcome . Three line evidence suggest novel neurotransmitter Nitric Oxide ( NO ) play central role pathophysiology schizophrenia . First , schizophrenia-like syndrome induced human phencyclidine ( PCP ) , drug mark psychomimetic property . Recent study indicate behavioral biochemical effect PCP rat block Nitric Oxid synthase ( NOS ) inhibitor , suggest NO play important role pharmacological effect PCP . Second , Postmortem brain tissue obtain autopsy schizophrenia control demonstrate increase NOS cerebellum brainstem schizophrenic patient . Third , NO play role learn memory , severly impaired schizophrenia . Minocycline second-generation tetracycline use human , effectively cross blood-brain barrier . Minocycline commonly use human , beneficial ant-imicrobial anti-inflammatory property . In addition , remarkable neuroprotective quality animal model cerebral ischemia , traumatic brain injury , Huntington 's Parkinson 's disease . The neuroprotective effect Minocycline associate mark inhibition inducible NO synthase ( iNOS ) , caspase 1 caspase 3 expression , p38 mitogen activate protein kinase ( MAPK ) . Recently , find Minocycline also inhibit cytochrome c release delay progression amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse . Because Minocycline may inhibit member caspase family , MAP kinase pathway NOS ( play central role neuroprotective effect Minocycline different model brain-disease ) , would like test neuroprotective effect Minocycline early development ( i.e.- first psychotic episode ) schizophrenia . The safety record Minocycline ability penetrate blood-brain barrier well know . Therefore , drug find neuroprotective effect schizophrenia may novel therapy .</detailed_description>
