	<detailed_description>This single-blind study evaluate safety efficacy Vyvanse™ provide pilot data two area : ( 1 ) use Near-Infrared Spectroscopy detect medication effect child ADHD ; ( 2 ) influence Vyvanse ™ read fluency comprehension period approximately 6 week . Subjects age 6 12 beginning study . The study consist period detail : Screening Washout . Subjects screen four week prior baseline . The washout period 3 day ADHD stimulant medication ( half life around 3-5 hour washout least 5 half-lives duration ) . Other medication discuss visit . The Screening Visit occur UCI Child Development Center allow determination appropriateness subject 's inclusion study . The Principal Investigator his/her designee must obtain write sign dated consent subject participate study subject 's parent ( ) /legally authorize representative assent must give subject , prior study relate procedure perform . This visit expect last 3-4 hour may take place across one day . The following procedure conduct Screening Visit : - Informed Consent/Assent obtain - Psychiatric evaluation utilize Kiddie-Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia-Present Lifetime Version ( K-SADS-PL ) accord DSM-IV-TR™ criterion - Inclusion/Exclusion criterion confirm - Demographics collect - Medical Medication History - Physical Examination include height ( use calibrate stadiometer ) , weight ( use calibrate scale ) - Sitting Vital Signs 5 minute rest ( oral tympanic temperature , pulse , blood pressure , respiratory rate ) - 12-Lead ECG 5 minute rest - Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test 2 ( KBIT2 ) : use ass verbal non-verbal cognitive ability . - Concomitant Medications review - Adverse Events review In addition , subject ask give small blood sample , safety screening purpose , laboratory procedure ( approximately 2 teaspoon ) .The follow lab procedure perform : - Hematology complete blood count ( CBC ) - Serum Chemistry - Urinalysis microscopic examination ( protein and/or blood detected urinalysis ) - Serum Pregnancy Test FOCP - A negative serum pregnancy test must document inclusion study - Urine drug test Baseline Procedures . After Screening washout procedure complete , subject return site Baseline Visit , last approximately 5-6 hour . Subjects provide one-week supply VyvanseTM 30mg/day . Subjects begin treatment morning baseline visit continue dose next week . The first dose medication administer site subsequent dose give subject 's parent ( ) /legally authorize representative require administer study drug subject upon awaken . During visit subject perform Attention Task NIRS recording also give Gray 's Oral Reading Test medication administer . After medication administer subject stay site second NIRS measurement take second time . They provide food activity wait period . The following procedure conduct Baseline Visit : - Confirmation continue eligibility ( i.e. , respect inclusion/exclusion criterion medication history ) - Sitting Vital Signs ( oral tympanic temperature , pulse , blood pressure respiratory rate ) - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent : Investigator Administered Scored ( ADHDRS-IV-Parent : Inv ) : The primary efficacy measure , use assess 18 symptom ADHD . - Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale ( CGI-S ) : This measure use assess severity subject 's symptom . - Concomitant Medications review subject . - Adverse Events - Medication administer on-site - Near Infrared Spectroscopy Attention Task perform twice , medication 3-4 hour first exposure medication . - Administer Gray Oral Reading Test-4 ( GORT-4 ) , use test oral reading rate , accuracy , fluency , comprehension , exposure medication . - Distribute Open-Label Study Drug - A one-week supply VyvanseTM 30mg capsule dispense , include dose administer site . Dose Optimization . During dose optimization period , subject visit office per week study doctor determine subject tolerate study medication she/he see benefit . These visit last approximately 45 minute . The Investigator review AEs , ADHD-RS-IV , CGI-I score , use clinical judgment ensure subject titrate acceptable dose VyvanseTM evaluation . The following procedure conduct dose optimization visit : - Sitting Vital Signs ( oral tympanic temperature , pulse , blood pressure respiratory rate ) - Subject Weight ( use calibrate scale ) - Investigator Dose Assessment - ADHD-RS-IV - Clinical Global Impressions Improvement Scale ( CGI-I ) . - Study Drug Accountability Compliance Assessment Performed - Distribute Open-Label Study Drug - Concomitant Medications - Adverse Events Dose Optimized NIRS GORT Testing This visit similar baseline visit . Subjects arrive early morning medication administer on-site . They remain site next 4 hour dose peak effect administer GORT NIRS . The following procedure happen visit : - Sitting Vital Signs 5 minute rest ( oral tympanic temperature , pulse , blood pressure respiratory rate ) - Subject weight ( use calibrate scale ) - An electrocardiogram perform . - Serum Pregnancy Test FOCP - A negative serum pregnancy test must document end study . - ADHD-RS-IV - CGI-I - Study Drug Accountability Compliance Assessment Performed - Concomitant Medications - Adverse Events - Medication administer on-site - Near Infrared Spectroscopy Attention Task perform . - Administer Gray 's Oral Reading Test . - Physical examination include height ( use calibrate stadiometer ) - 12 Lead ECG 30-day Follow-up Phone Call</detailed_description>
