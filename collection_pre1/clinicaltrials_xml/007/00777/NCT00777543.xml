	<brief_title>Increasing Ferulic Acid Bioavailability Bran</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Whole grain consumption associate low risk develop metabolic syndrome , cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes type cancer . Whole grain good source antioxidant compound ferulic acid , consider major antioxidant . Ferulic acid also major phenolic compound wheat grain , mainly locate bran , precisely cell wall aleurone layer overall bran layer . Most ferulic acid covalently bound indigestible cell wall polysaccharide , limit bioavailability ferulic acid cereal product merely form free ferulic acid . Processing possibility development cereal product might use optimize bioavailability ferulic acid human possible health effect wholegrain product . An innovative processing bread making develop . The processing consist pretreatments bran enzymatic mixture yeast fermentation incorporation dough . The impact vitro assess bioavailability ferulic acid 5-fold increase normal bran enrich wholegrain bread gastrointestinal model . Therefore study compare kinetics total bioavailability ferulic acid wholegrain bread enrich native pretreated bran . Furthermore , colonic metabolism ferulic acid overall major colonic metabolite short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) study . Finally , total antioxidant capacity ex vivo inflammatory response investigate order determine effect pretreatment immunomodulatory property bran . Objective : The aim present study investigate effect pretreatment bran improve bioavailability ferulic acid . As secondary endpoint investigate change plasmatic antioxidant capacity , anti-inflammatory effect , colonic metabolite ferulic acid short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) . Study design : Blind , cross-over , randomise design . Wash-out period one week . Three day low antioxidant diet . Standardised meal low phenolic antioxidant compound consume even trial . Study population : Healthy male volunteer , &gt; 18 yr old , BMI 20 30 . Intervention : Consumption 300 g wholegrain enrich native pretreated bran . Main study parameters/endpoints : Ferulic acid phenolic acid ( sinapic acid , p-coumaric acid ) , total antioxidant capacity , anti-inflammatory effect , colonic metabolite derive ferulic acid SCFA . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Each volunteer participate study two separate occasion ( test take approximately 24 hour ) . Blood drawn different time point via catheter ( total 156 ml per test-day ) 24-hour urine sample collect . Participants ask consume standardise meal even two test-days even intervention day . Volunteers instruct consume wholegrain bran containing product , nut seed , antioxidant supplement beverage high phenolic compound phenolic rich food 3 day three trial . Subjects ask record food intake 3 day trial . All ingredient use bread bake safe human consumption . The bread consume begin test . The volunteer benefit study . The major risk study amount blood take volunteer risk limit .</detailed_description>
