	<brief_summary>Oxytocin cardio vascular effect hypotension , tachycardia possibly coronary spasm . The uterotonic effect drug use cesarean section , minimize blood loss.ECG change suggestive cardiac ischemia ( ST depression ) show previous study patient undergo cesarean section regional anaesthesia . The effect oxytocin outcome investigated extent . In current study , test hypothesis difference occurrence ECG change ( ST segment depression ) two dos oxytocin . Participants randomize receive either 5 10 unit oxytocin double blinded fashion . Main outcome measure occurrence significant ST depression ECG . Secondary outcome measure mean arterial pressure , heart rate , blood loss , symptoms chest pain , shortness breath feeling heaviness chest .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All healthy term participant schedule undergo elective caesarean section spinal anaesthesia Department Obstetrics Gynecology , University Hospital , Uppsala Sweden &gt; 18 year old , candidate inclusion study . . The study approve regional ethic committee inform write consent obtain participant . ECGs record continuous ambulatory ECG ( Holter ) monitoring ( GE Medical system SEER/MARS , UK ) peroperative period utilize lead V3 , V5 avF . As secondary outcome , symptom chest pain , shortness breath feeling heaviness chest , Troponin I level 12 hour postoperatively , record . Also , secondary outcome , difference blood pressure , heart rate , blood loss measure . Before induction anaesthesia , patient receive 1000 mL lactate Ringer 's solution intravenously . Thereafter additional 500-1000 mL lactate Ringer 's solution 500 mL Hydroxyethyl starch infuse consider needed anaesthesiologist . Spinal anaesthesia establish sit position lumbal interspace L2/L3 L3/L4 . Non invasive blood pressure ( systolic , diastolic mean arterial pressure , MAP ) heart rate monitor every 2 minute , throughout surgery . Oxytocin give intravenous bolus dose immediately clamp umbilical cord . Blood loss operation estimate record . During surgery , spontaneous complaint patient symptoms chest pain , shortness breath feeling heaviness chest , record well duration symptom . Episodes chest pain assess visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Troponin I , marker ischemic myocardial damage , sample 12 hour postoperatively . The incidence ECG change relate different dos intravenous bolus dos oxytocin ( 5 10 unit ) caesarean section unknown . In pilot study precede present study , 5 unit oxytocin administrate incidence ECG change 15 % . With assumption ECG change could occur 50 % subject receive 10 unit oxytocin base 0.8 power detect significant difference ( P = 0.05 , two-sided ) , 25 patient require study group . An interim analysis perform inclusion 50 patient reveal ECG-changes occur 8 24 % respectively two group 5 10 unit oxytocin . An additional 50 patient allocated second interim analysis plan . A computer-generated randomisation list block four drawn statistician give pharmacy department perform randomisation . The procedure ensure allocation concealment . All participant , health care provider , investigator person ( cardiologist ) blind treatment assignment duration study . The Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Windows , version 15.0 , use ( SPSS , Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . To compare group distribution chi-squared test Fisher 's exact test apply Mann-Whitney U-test t-test continuous variable . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider indicate significant difference</detailed_description>
