	<brief_summary>Participants 60 old without Parkinson 's disease mild cognitive decline randomize either standard high carbohydrate diet carbohydrate-restricted ketogenic diet 8 week . The main hypothesis nutritional ketosis improve memory functioning . Pre post-memory testing perform . Subjects also provide blood sample subset subject receive magnetic resonance brain imaging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity metabolic disturbance recognize important risk disorder cardiovascular disease , stroke , cancer . However , condition also contribute age-related cognitive decline dementia . In particular , insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia promote neurocognitive dysfunction neurodegenerative change extend pre-clinical phase Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The prevalence metabolic disturbance dementia increase dramatically , absence effective treatment , preventive approach essential address ominous public health concern represent Alzheimer 's disease form dementia . Dietary intervention promise under-investigated preventive option . Regimens involve restrict carbohydrate consumption design induce ketone metabolism show improve metabolic parameter . In addition , ketone metabolism associate host benefit neural function , among enhanced mitochondrial energy production reduction neuropathological factor . Ketone feed study demonstrate acute functional improvement older adult neurocognitive decline . This research design ass efficacy strict carbohydrate restriction correct hyperinsulinemia improve neurocognitive function old adult early memory decline . Recently , show relatively brief intervention involve low carbohydrate , ketogenic diet improve memory subject Mild Cognitive Impairment . We would like extend initial finding add new study arm involve old adult subject Parkinson 's disease Mild Cognitive Impairment . We also increase intervention period six week eight week . Aim 1 : To evaluate effect adaptation ketosis cognitive function old adult Age-Associated Memory Impairment ( AAMI ) Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . Hypothesis 1 . Subjects AAMI MCI show improved working memory long-term memory ability practice low carbohydrate , ketogenic diet six week relative comparison subject maintain typical , high carbohydrate , nonketogenic diet . Aim 2 : To assess effect ketone metabolism memory motor function subject Parkinson 's disease Mild Cognitive Impairment eight ( 8 ) week dietary intervention . Hypothesis 2 . Subjects Parkinson 's disease MCI show improve working memory long-term memory function practice low carbohydrate , ketogenic diet eight week relative comparison subject consume typical , high carbohydrate nonketogenic diet . Hypothesis 3 . Subjects Parkinson 's disease MCI show improve motor function practice low carbohydrate , ketogenic diet eight week relative comparison subject consume typical , high carbohydrate nonketogenic diet . We also evaluate change mood , ketone body level , serum lipid , inflammatory marker , fast glucose insulin assess relationship factor primary outcome measure . We obtain diet record intervention ass adherence protocol .</detailed_description>
