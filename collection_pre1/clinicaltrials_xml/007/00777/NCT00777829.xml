	<detailed_description>Research provide evidence strong , specific connection sleep memory . This research show sleep necessary certain type memory form , certain sleep stage lead specific type learn memory consolidation , naps effective night-time sleep learn memory process . Current evidence also indicate different type memory different type operate develop independently . In study , three different memory type examine : perceptual , motor , declarative memory . Perceptual memory measure ability recognize discrete stimulus ; motor memory measure ability perform specific , coordinated task ; declarative memory measure ability recite memorize information . Different stag sleep cycle correlate improvement memory process . For instance , improvement perceptual memory task dependent rapid eye motion ( REM ) sleep ; motor learning related sleep stage 2 ; declarative memory consolidation relate short wave sleep ( SWS ) , include sleep stage 3 4 . New drug target specific sleep stage increase amount time people spend stage sleep . For example , new prescription drug zolpidem increase time spend stage 2 sleep , drug sodium oxybate increase time spend SWS . Compared sleep impact either zolpidem sodium oxybate , normal sleep proportionally time spent REM . This study use medication , lack , manipulate much time spend REM , stage 2 , SWS . The study examine whether percentage sleep spent different stage affect learn process associate stage . Participation study last 6 week . At outset , participant undergo 2-hour screening visit include medical history , physical examination , routine lab test , urine test drug pregnancy , electrocardiogram , clinical interview mental health . Participants also ask complete series questionnaire subjective sleep quality , sleep quantity , daytime sleepiness . Participants complete five study visit , begin 1 week screening separate 5 10 day allow drug wash-out recovery effect previous visit . Each study visit involve overnight stay sleep lab . Participants arrive 8 PM , go bed 10 PM , awaken 5 AM . Between 6 8 AM , undergo three different test , correspond different type learn memory process : perceptual , motor , declarative . The test include recognize target image , type specific finger sequence keyboard , verbally recall list word . Participants receive one study drug placebo 8:30 AM allow take 90-minute nap 9 11 AM . They receive different drug , different dosage , placebo study visit . Between 4 6 PM , retested previous three test . While sleep , participant outfit sensor monitor muscle activity , eye movement , brain wave , heart lung functioning , and—on first night—breathing . For entire duration study , participant wear actigraph , wristwatch-like device monitor sleep cycle . Participants also require maintain regular sleep schedule , go sleep wake 2-hour window day . They also report sleep schedule caffeine , alcohol , drug use daily sleep diary . Caffeine , alcohol , drug use prohibit start noon day prior study visit .</detailed_description>
