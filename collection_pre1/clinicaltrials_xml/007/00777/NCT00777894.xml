	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess feasibility safety radiotherapy ( RT ) patient hepatocellular carcinoma . ( Phase I ) - To assess safety efficacy RT patient . ( Phase II ) - To generate reproducible peptide pattern serum proteome specific serum sub proteomes patient . - To assess change proteome sub proteome pattern RT patient . - To detect peptide discriminate RT patient . - To identify discriminate peptide patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients undergo radiotherapy ( RT ) daily , five day week , 6 week . Intensity-modulated , 3-dimensional conformal , fractionate stereotactic RT may use . After completion study therapy , patient phase I portion follow 1 year patient phase II portion follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
