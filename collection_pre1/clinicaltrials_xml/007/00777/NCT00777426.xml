	<brief_summary>A total 60 participant enrol . They 3 group 1 . ARV-naïve , HIV-positive ≥ 20 year age HAD ( n=25 ) intend start ARV 2 . ARV-naïve , HIV-positive ≥ 20 year age without HAD ( n=25 ) , intend start ARV 3 . HIV-negative ≥ 20 year age ( n=10 ) . The protocol team work primary care physician ensure subject receive standard HIV ARV care ; however , initiation ARV requirement study ARV provide study . Participant accrual include 10-15 participant per year . HIV-positive subject tentatively enrol HAD vs. non-HAD group enrol neurologist subsequently confirm group consensus conference hold every 6 month study neurologist . In case disagreement , case re-assigned consensus conference determination recruitment continue . An external validation consensus conference conduct well every 6-12 month monitor correct assignment level impairment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIV-1 Specific Immune Responses Thai Individuals With HIV Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This application focus role cellular immune response HIV dementia ( HAD ) versus non-HAD individual cognitively characterize cohort follow one year . Increasing evidence link strong CD4+ T helper function robust CD8+ CTL response . HIV-1-infected individual able maintain strong HIV-1 specific T cell response well clinical outcome rarely develop neurological sign symptom . Monocyte/macrophage ( M/M ) infiltration white matter brain hallmark HAD ; however , mechanism M/M recruit brain clearly understood . We hypothesize loss specific HIV-1 T cell response result activation/dysregulation M/M lead accumulation brain . To test hypothesis characterize Thai HIV-1-infected individual follow : 25 HAD individual , 25 CD4- , education- , gender- , age-matched non-HAD individual 10 HIV negative control . We : 1 ) define CD4+ CD8+ T cell function evaluate HIV-1 specific response HAD vs. non-HAD group ; 2 ) simultaneously correlate response M/M subpopulation cell number , percentage , immune function ; 3 ) correlate response HIV-1 proviral load autologous viral sequence ( viral escape sequence HIV quasispecies ) ; 4 ) evaluate impact ARV dementia relate change immunological response . Since little known interaction CD4+ T helper response , CTL function , level M/M subpopulation activation neuropathogenesis HAD , innovative study elucidate role HIV-1 specific immune response HAD provide new insight HIV-1 neuropathogenesis relationship peripheral immune response , potentially open excite new area investigation .</detailed_description>
