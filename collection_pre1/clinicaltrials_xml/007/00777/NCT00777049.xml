	<brief_title>Study Panobinostat Monotherapy Women With HER2-negative Locally Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , open label , multi-centre , two-arm , two-stage design , international study oral panobinostat woman HER2-negative locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer . In first stage trial , 21 evaluable patient HR+ ( ER+ and/or PgR+ ) , HER2-negative , treat ( Arm I ) ; le 3 response observe , arm would stop treatment patient population would declare ineffective . In arm , 27 evaluable patient HR- ( ER- PgR- ) , HER2-negative , treat ( Arm II ) ; le 2 response observe , arm would stop treatment patient population would declare ineffective . Given protocol condition , study stop Arm II due low recruitment insufficient data available draw conclusion regard efficacy arm . It also note one response observe group.. In Arm I , among 25 evaluable patient , study achieve require number tumor response allow enrolment continue . As protocol amend stop enrolment remove analysis initially plan secondary objective ( Progression Free Survival Overall Survival ) consider small study sample size . The patient already include give option continue study reach plan end-of-study visit .</detailed_description>
