	<brief_title>Phase I/II Pilot Study Mixed Chimerism Treat Hemoglobinopathies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) emerge therapeutic alternative patient sickle cell disease . Conventional HSCT therapy limit extremely high-risk hemoglobinopathy patient . Those patient may difficult identify end-organ damage develops . Also , conventional HSCT available minority candidate Histocompatibility Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) identical sibling donate bone marrow mobilize peripheral blood stem cell . This study propose two important improvement conventional HSCT : - Donor peripheral blood bone marrow process via new technology , deplete mature immune cell enrich hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) graft facilitate cell ( FC ) . - A reduced intensity recipient condition regimen use promote mixed allogeneic chimerism , oppose full donor chimerism , follow HSCT . These two element may significantly improve benefit : risk ratio HSCT patient hemoglobinopathy . Stem cell transplantation may become feasible option patient HLA-identical sibling donate stem cell . Also , transplantation may offer patient early disease progression , end-organ damage occurs .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The following criterion establish identify subject sickle cell disease ( SCD ) high predict morbidity risk early mortality . Subjects S/S disease , S/C disease , Hemoglobin H disease , Alpha Thalassemia Major , Thalassemia Major ( also know Cooley 's anemia ) S/B* thalassemia one follow medical complication eligible : History impaired neurological function and/or finding Magnetic Resonance Image ( MRI ) /Magnetic Resonance Angiogram ( MRA ) associate sickle cell disease More 1 episode acute chest syndrome stage I II pulmonary disease Osteonecrosis involve ≥ 2 joint Sickle cell nephropathy evidence glomerular filtration rate 30 % 50 % predict normal Alloimmunization sufficient interfere efficacy chronic transfusion therapy Chronic recurrent priapism Major visual impairment one eye bilateral proliferative retinopathy Persistent disable pain ( ≥ 2 episode per year ) despite trial chronic transfusion and/or hydroxyurea recommend dos least 6 month duration Additional General Criteria : Subjects must also meet follow general inclusion criterion : Subjects must relate donor ( identical mismatch 1 , 2 3 HLA A , HLAB HLADR locus ) . Subjects must adequate cardiopulmonary function document leave ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50 % ( within normal limit per Institutional criterion ) leave ventricular shorten fraction Within normal limit ( WNL ) per Institutional criterion , without inotropic support . If Ejection fraction 4050 % , patient may consider participation clear Cardiologist . Subjects must adequate pulmonary function document Diffusing capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) Forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) 50 % predict age size . If DLCO FEV1 4050 % , patient may consider participation clear Pulmonologist . Subjects must adequate hepatic function demonstrate serum albumin ≥ 3.0 mg/dL , serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal . Subjects must adequate renal function demonstrate serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL . If serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL , creatinine clearance test must do result 50 % normal . Subjects legal guardian must give write informed consent , subject must assent age intellectually appropriate . There age limit protocol . Uncontrolled infection severe concomitant disease , judgment Principal Investigator , could tolerate transplantation . Severe impairment functional performance evidence Karnofsky ( patient ≥16 year old ) Lansky ( child &lt; 16 year old ) score &lt; 70 % Stage III IV sickle cell pulmonary disease Renal insufficiency ( GFR &lt; 25 % predict normal age ) Subjects positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody test result Subjects pregnant , indicate positive serum human chorionic gonadotrophin ( HCG ) test Subjects childbearing potential practicing adequate contraception define investigator site Subjects must previous radiation therapy would preclude total body irradiation ( determine radiation oncologist ) .</criteria>
