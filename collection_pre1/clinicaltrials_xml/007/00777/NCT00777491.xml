	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , cisplatin , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study two different chemotherapy radiation therapy regimen see work treat patient stage II stage III bladder cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate rate distant metastasis 3 year patient undergone transurethral resection bladder tumor stage II III muscle-invasive bladder cancer treat chemoradiotherapy comprise fluorouracil , cisplatin , radiotherapy v gemcitabine hydrochloride radiotherapy follow selective bladder preservation adjuvant chemotherapy comprise gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin . Secondary - To estimate treatment completion rate patient . - To estimate acute late grade toxicity ( ≥ grade 3 genitourinary , gastrointestinal , hematologic toxicity ) regimens patient . - To estimate efficacy regimen , term achieve complete response primary tumor , patient . - To estimate efficacy regimen , term preserve native , tumor-free bladder 5 year completion therapy , patient . - To estimate value tumor histopathologic , molecular genetic , DNA content , metabolomic , proteomic parameter possible significant prognostic factor initial tumor response recurrence-free survival . - To analyze American Urological Association ( AUA ) Symptom score baseline 3 year patient arm . - To find potentially predictive biomarkers cystectomy-free survival . - To find potentially predictive biomarkers acute late toxicity . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord tumor stage ( T2 vs T3-4a ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Induction therapy ( week 1-4 ) : - Arm I : Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously 72 hour day 1-3 15-17 cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy twice daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-17 . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 , 22 , 25 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 . All patient undergo evaluation response 3-4 week completion induction therapy . Patients pT1 bad tumor response undergo radical cystectomy within 3-8 week response evaluation . Patients pT0 , Ta , Tis tumor response ( site distant original tumor ) proceed consolidation therapy within 7-14 day response evaluation . - Consolidation therapy ( week 8-10 ) : - Arm I : Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously 72 hour day 1-3 8-10 cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy twice daily day 1-5 8-10 . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15 , 16 . Patients proceed adjuvant therapy 12 week completion consolidation therapy OR 8-12 week radical cystectomy . - Adjuvant therapy ( week 21-33 17-29 ) : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30-60 minute day 1 8 cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day total 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
