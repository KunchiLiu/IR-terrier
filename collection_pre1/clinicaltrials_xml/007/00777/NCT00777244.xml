	<brief_summary>Study Rationale Adrenocortical carcinoma ( ACC ) rare disease high risk relapse radical surgery . The efficacy adjuvant mitotane treatment suggest retrospective multicenter international study show postoperative mitotane treatment associate significant reduction risk relapse death . However , promise result need confirmation randomize prospective study . Caution adopt particularly patient low risk disease relapse , benefit therapy weight side effect . Even adjuvant treatment seem justified patient high risk relapse , randomise prospective study need assess whether treatment efficacious patient low-intermediate risk . The purpose present study determine whether adjuvant mitotane treatment effective prolonging disease free survival patient adrenocortical carcinoma low-intermediate risk progression underwent radical resection</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endpoints Primary : To compare DFS ( Disease Free Survival ) , define time date randomization documentation follow failure ( whichever occurs first ) : -local distant recurrence disease ; -death cause completion follow-up . Secondary : To compare OS ( Overall Survival ) , define time interval date randomization date death cause last known alive date ; 路 To compare quality life measure EORTC-QLQ-C30路 To compare toxicity , grade accord NCI-CTG criterion ; 路 To compare DFS OS patient achieve serum mitotane concentration &gt; 14 mg/L ; 路 To compare DFS OS 2 arm patient subgroup stratify accord : type hormone secretion , stage disease , histopathologic characteristic .</detailed_description>
