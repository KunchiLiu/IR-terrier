	<detailed_description>Until , trial common stop therapy progressive disease occur ; RECIST criterion use , progressive disease define &gt; 20 % increase sum long diameter lesion , occurence new lesion . However , angiogenesis inhibitor rather cytostatic cytotoxic effect compare chemotherapeutics , result less frequently reduction tumor volume see . Often centre lesion necrosis show . Sometimes accompanied edema ; even tumor volume increase result without real progression case . Recently , clinic , find number patient , treat oral angiogenesis inhibitor , remarkable quicken progressive disease complaint stop treatment . Reintroduction another type angiogenesis inhibitor subsequently lead new stabilization . The causality phenomenon unknown . Perhaps inhibitory effect angiogenesis fully exhaust moment progressive disease CT observe . An alternative explanation contra reaction longterm angiogenetic inhibition upregulation proangiogenic factor subsequent vascular expansion edema . This study mean gain insight information optimal treatment policy progressive disease find patient treated oral angiogenesis inhibitor . Because increase patient treated product , trial daily clinical practice , important investigate .</detailed_description>
