	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine well combination chemotherapy drug work bevacizumab eliminate primary tumor breast prior surgery ( pathological complete response pCR breast ) . Bevacizumab drug work block new blood vessel formation tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy bevacizumab surgery may allow less amount breast tissue remove . To able predict future patient likely get pCR drug combination , specialized test tumor tissue perform .</brief_summary>
