	<brief_title>ED Residents MBP During CVC Placement : Sim Lab Based Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central line associate bloodstream infection ( CL-ABI ) important preventable cause nosocomial infection responsible considerable morbidity mortality . It estimate 5 26 % patient experience infectious complication central venous catheter [ 1 ] . In United States , estimate nearly 50,000 patient develop central line associate bloodstream infection ICUs annually , rate approximately 5 infection per 1000 catheter day [ 2 ] many 15,000 death annually . Central line associate bloodstream infection also associate increase hospital ICU length stay ICU ( 2 ) . Estimates cost CL-ABI hospital range $ 25,000 $ 65,000 per patient [ 3 , 4 ] . The Centers Disease Control publish guideline prevention CL-ABI represent collaborative effort multidisciplinary coalition professional organization provide evidence base recommendation prevent catheter relate infection [ 5 ] . The intervention emphasize five distinct practice , include : education training healthcare provider place care catheter , utilize maximum sterile barrier precaution catheter placement , skin preparation use 2 % chlorhexidine , avoid routine replacement central line strategy reduce infection , use antiseptic antibiotic coat line event infection rate remain high despite adherence measure [ 5 ] . Several study demonstrate impressive reduction CL-ABI application strategy , range 18 100 % reduction realize significant reduction mortality cost [ 2 ] . The simple introduction maximum sterile barrier precaution insert central line observe dramatically reduce infection rate decade [ 6 ] . However , CDC 's guideline , despite seem simplicity , find frequently insufficiently apply , whether ignorance omission [ 2 ] . In past 12 month total 24 documented central venous line ( CVL ) infection SLRHC cumulative rate infection 3.8 per 1000 central line day . These infection rate figure benchmark experience . For SLRHC cost incur past 12 month estimate $ 1,080,000 . Training education healthcare personnel utilization maximum sterile precaution two important area . Residents still frequently learn central line placement technique `` see one , one , teach one '' method , definition allows multitude technique practice . While teach theoretically include utilization maximal sterile precaution central line placement , focus teaching , resident ' anxiety , often focused proper placement line , sterile technique use place . In emergency medicine , resident also frequently learn procedure emergent environment- attention maximum sterile precaution may less ideal . Guzzo et al find particular mentor trainee perform CVC placement emergent non-emergent situation significantly less likely consistently utilize maximum sterile precaution [ 8 ] . Furthermore , study video-based training sterile technique CVC insertion trauma resuscitation unit evaluate non-emergent CVC placement , total 5 case central- catheter- relate bacteremia report 68 patient , even video base training , 26 % resident continue infraction compliance sterile precaution [ 9 ] . Medical simulator allow resident practice skill realistic interactive environment minimizes risk patient . Studies find simulation effective mean teach skill diverse ACLS airway management laparoscopic surgical skill [ 10,11,12 ] . Additionally , use audio-visual equipment medical simulator record resident 's performance give valuable firsthand feedback otherwise available , allow resident visualize misstep [ 13 ] . This hypothesize particular value proper acquisition physical skill maximum sterile precaution . Furthermore , Society Academic Medicine recently publish consensus paper outline research agenda use simulation Emergency Medicine identify procedural training priority area note `` incompletely tested assessment method range procedural skill require emergency physician [ 14 ] . '' The paper go state : `` Competency '' must define precisely every procedure . Each step must identify , proper sequence step must establish . Objective checklist expert score system must create , train assessment methodology must validate . [ 14 ] With mind , Department Emergency Medicine recently approve training policy aseptic technique central venous access placement ( see attach copy ) . All EM resident train MBP technique Sim Lab . Training include baseline assessment resident skill maintain maximum sterile precaution use standardized score tool , videotape training , short exam , individual simulate debrief performance correct MBP follow assessment training need . We plan collect data prospectively EM resident undergo evaluation training maximum barrier precaution CVC placement . Data review analyzed future research publication</detailed_description>
