	<brief_title>Assessment Safety Pharmacokinetics Low Dose Methotrexate Healthy Adult Male Kenyan Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Currently control malaria rest use chemotherapy . However , development resistance common use drug represent major public concern . Thus , investigator need develop new cheap drug . The investigator discover old drug methotrexate ( MTX ) , use treatment cancer rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , active malaria parasite , include resistant existing antimalarial . In treatment RA , MTX use weekly low dose several year . At dose , MTX safe well tolerate human child . This low dose MTX also kill malaria parasite human . Thus , want study MTX antimalarial . As part study , investigator need establish whether dose investigator want , 5 mg per day 5 day , drug safe well tolerate 25 Kenyan adult volunteer . This result study inform u use MTX treatment malaria child . What question investigator try answer ? The investigator try assess safety 5mg dose per day 5 Where study take place , many people involve select ? The study take place KEMRI , Centre Clinical Research , Nairobi . The study involve 25 healthy adult . What study involve take part ? Healthy adult male invite join study . A small blood sample collect arm ass body respond , state blood , liver kidney function administration drug . This sample also use rule presence infection HIV Hepatitis . Study patient give MTX every day 5 day . During day Hospitalization patient assess physical examination , test check liver function day 1 5 . Patients follow minimum 42 day see clinic day 7 , 14 , 28 42 . The state blood , liver kidney do start treatment day 28 . Patients also require undergo sample assess level drug blood different time start treatment . What benefit risks/costs study involve Study subject receive full medical consultation treatment through-out study period . Long term benefit could addition MTX list antimalaria drug available treatment non serious malaria . During follow period opportunity health follow closely dedicate team clinician . MTX use extensively low dose treatment RA . The drug safe well tolerate human child . However , use chronic basis , adverse reaction far report , mostly gastrointestinal upset associate nausea vomit . The risk sign occur small since use drug 5 day . How study benefit society ? This study may help development MTX cheap , safe easy use drug treatment malaria add already available list drug .</detailed_description>
