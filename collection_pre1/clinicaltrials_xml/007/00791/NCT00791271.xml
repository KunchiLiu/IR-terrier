	<brief_summary>The goal first phase clinical research study find high tolerable dose decitabine peginterferon alfa-2b give combination patient melanoma . The safety drug combination also study . The goal second phase learn decitabine peginterferon alfa-2b combine help control melanoma , find dos effective and/or well tolerate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Parallel Phase I/II Trial Decitabine Peg-Interferon Melanoma : Phase I Portion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Decitabine design damage DNA cell , may cause cancer cell die . Peginterferon alfa-2b design strengthen immune system , may decrease tumor growth . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 6 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 44 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose decitabine peginterferon alfa-2b receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level study drug combination . Each new group receive high dose level group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose study drug combination find . If enrol Phase II portion , dose decitabine peginterferon alfa-2b receive depend join study , well research data Phase I portion . You randomly assign ( roll dice ) receive one dose level ( may 1 6 dose level , depend available data Phase I portion ) find Phase I portion least side effect possibly effective . This mean equal chance assign dose level use time . As study go , research data suggest one dose level may well tolerate others , new participant enrol Phase II portion would likely assign possibly well dose level . No matter phase enrol , dose study drug may lower tolerate study drug combination well . Study Drug Administration : A `` cycle '' study 28 day . Decitabine give vein , 1 hour , Days 1-5 cycle . Peginterferon alfa-2b give injection skin , week ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 21 ) . You give peginterferon alfa-2b nursing supervision day receive decitabine . On Day 6 cycle , either receive Neulasta ( pegfilgrastim ) Neupogen ( filgrastim ) . Pegfilgrastim filgrastim inject skin . If receive pegfilgrastim , inject Day 6 cycle . If receive filgrastim , inject 1 time day many day doctor decides need raise white blood cell count . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle , follow procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask medication treatment may currently receive side effect may experience . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . These test list repeated additional visit research nurse Week 3 Cycles 1 2 . If experience severe side effect Cycles 1 2 , extra Week 3 visit research nurse longer necessary later cycle . They may , however , start need . At end Cycle 3 , every odd cycle ( Cycles 5 , 7 , 9 , ) , scan perform ( CT MRI ) check status disease . Length Study Participation : You may remain study long benefitting . If disease get bad intolerable side effect occur , take study early . End-of-Study Visit : Once go study reason , end-of-study visit procedure perform Day 1 study visit . You may also scan performed ( CT MRI ) check status disease one perform last 4 week . Long-Term Follow-Up : Every 3 month 2 year , researcher call see . This investigational study . Decitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Peginterferon alfa-2b FDA approve commercially available treatment hepatitis C. Their use together study treatment melanoma consider experimental . At time , combination use research . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
