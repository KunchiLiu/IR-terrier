	<brief_summary>The objective pilot study estimate procedure biological sample routinely obtain site suspect infection could guide early realization TEP FDG couple scanner X , patient hospitalize ICU severe sepsis unspecified etiology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation MorphoTEP With FDG Among Patients Severe Sepsis Unspecified Etiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis constitutes lead cause mortality ICU , particular microbial documentation lack half case . Tomography emission positons , use property activate macrophage leucocyte collect 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose may prove useful identify site ( ) infection guide sample . Thirty patient include 12 month . Within 24 hour admission , patient present severe sepsis still unknown etiology benefit realization morphoTEP , include examination MtOe FDG , associate conventional scanner X . Suspected infect site subject sample possible . These sample send microbial culture , histology TREM-1 expression ( membrane-bound soluble form ) appropriate . The main judgement criterion percentage MtOe exams prove useful diagnosis and/or associate therapeutic modification . This pilot study make possible evaluate interest early realization TEP/scanner X examination among severe sepsis patient unknown origin .</detailed_description>
