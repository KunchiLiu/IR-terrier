Physical activity select target behavior : 1. high percentage young adult cancer survivor sedentary lifestyle 2. research show cancer survivor increase physical activity experience improve cardiopulmonary function , reduce fatigue , enhance mood superior cancer outcome . The intervention base previously develop , theoretically-grounded , tailored Internet intervention sedentary adult . This previously develop intervention use component Transtheoretical Model Social Cognitive Theory promote physical activity ; example , participant complete monthly questionnaire online receive tailored feedback report address self-efficacy , decisional balance process change . The intervention website also include feature tip exercise care young child local physical activity resource . Two key enhancement add intervention website order target young adult cancer survivor populationâ€” 1. information pertinent cancer survivor initiate exercise program 2. peer-to-peer support component . Once enhancements added , 10 young adult cancer survivor evaluate intervention provide qualitative feedback . Additional revision make intervention , need , base feedback . The intervention pilot test sample 40 young adult cancer survivor . Participants randomly assign intervention group ( receive 12 week access intervention website ) comparison group ( receive information three cancer-specific Internet site ) . Data intervention feasibility acceptability collect along preliminary data intervention effect ( i.e. , physical activity level , mood , fatigue ) . The latter use effect size estimate design future efficacy trial .</detailed_description>
