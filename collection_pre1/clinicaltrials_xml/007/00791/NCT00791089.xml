	<detailed_description>AF prevalent arrhythmia , affect &gt; 2 million Americans . Antiarrhythmic drug therapy often ineffective eliminate recurrent episode AF . In recent year radiofrequency catheter ablation emerge highly effective treatment strategy patient paroxysmal chronic AF.6 , 7 However , AF may recur within day week successful ablation procedure 50 % patient , probably inflammatory response thermal injury cause radiofrequency energy application . These early recurrence AF ablation necessarily predict long-term clinical outcome 30-50 % patient develop early recurrence ultimately remain sinus rhythm without need additional ablation.8 However , early recurrence AF may associate significant morbidity due trouble symptom rapid ventricular rate , multiple hospital visit cardioversions , need antiarrhythmic drug therapy prolongation duration anticoagulant therapy . It also possible early recurrence AF ablation avoid , probability remain sinus rhythm long-term follow-up may higher , maintenance sinus rhythm early-on may facilitate reverse leave atrial remodeling . A similar phenomenon may occur post-operative AF , develop ~30 % patient undergo cardiac surgery . Post-operative AF often transient usually resolve within 3 month surgery . Perioperative treatment omega-3 fatty acid report decrease incidence postoperative AF coronary artery by-pass surgery.4 Because pathogenetic factor play role postoperative AF early recurrence AF radiofrequency catheter ablation may similar , plausible treatment omega-3 fatty acid ablation associate reduction incidence early recurrence AF .</detailed_description>
