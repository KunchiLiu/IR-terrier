	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Using Nelfinavir With Chemoradiation Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 trial HIV protease inhibitor ( HPI ) Nelfinavir ( NFV ) combination radiotherapy chemotherapy patient locally advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) consider candidate pre-operative treatment . This study conduct accord US international standard Good Clinical Practice ( FDA Title 21 part 312 International Conference Harmonization guideline ) , applicable government regulation Institutional research policy procedures . The endpoint determine safety NFV chemoradiation , gather preliminary data response , tissue specimen correlative molecular study . Unacceptable toxicity unlikely prior study determine dose 1250 mg twice day relatively safe HIV patient receive radiation therapy . NFV start one week prior chemo-radiotherapy continue duration chemoradiation ( approximately 6 1/2 week ) . Standard radiotherapy ( minimum total dose 5040 cGy ) combine ( cisplatin/etoposide ) chemotherapy base SWOG 8805 deliver combination NFV . The thoracic surgery attend physician determine feasibility resection . If patient resectable disease , attend thoracic surgeon perform thoracotomy anatomical resection . If patient unresectable disease , subject follow 30 day post NFV administration . After initial 30 day post-NFV , subject follow long-term outcome ( disease response overall survival ) . Adjuvant therapy may continue off-study discretion manage oncology personnel . Tumors obtain time surgical resection assess pathological response . Tumor tissue take pre-treatment assessed marker may predict response Akt , VEGF , EGFR .</detailed_description>
