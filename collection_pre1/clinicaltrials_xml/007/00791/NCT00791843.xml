	<brief_summary>PP1- The purpose study determine whether give hormone produce everyone call growth hormone release hormone ( GHRH ) improve heart function individual congestive heart failure . You must 50 year old old , diagnosis congestive heart failure , high likelihood lower normal growth hormone effect . GHRH approve US FDA treatment child growth hormone deficiency GHRH stimulate Growth Hormone ( GH ) . Its use treatment congestive heart failure adult investigational . Growth hormone release hormone hormone produce brain . We use synthetic hormone make laboratory . It identical hormone brain . Many old people , due age low level growth hormone . The aim study find whether restore growth hormone level level find young individual maintain level 12 week help strengthen heard muscle older person congestive heart failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PP1- The overall purpose study evaluate effect Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone ( GHRH ) cardiac structure function subject age 50 year old diagnosis congestive heart failure single blind ( subject ) randomize treatment/placebo study design . They receive 12 week drug placebo , 6 week washout , 12 week placebo drug- whichever n't receive first 12 week . The hypothesis : 1 ) normal age associated evidence decline somatotrophic activity exemplify IGF-1 level ; 2 ) GHRH raise level Growth hormone IGF-1 elderly individual dose dependent fashion minimal deleterious side effect ; 3 ) GHRH produce measurable increment myocardial performance structure demonstrate growth peripheral musculature ; 4 ) combination benefit result good quality life due improvement overall cardiac function .</detailed_description>
