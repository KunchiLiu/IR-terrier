	<brief_summary>Objective : This study aim determine effectiveness efficiency national accreditation improvement programme general practice , focus patient establish cardiovascular disease . Design : Cluster randomise trial block design . All practice start accreditation procedure.Intervention group practice request focus improvement plan first year cardiovascular disease . Control group practice request focus improvement plan first year domain . Measurements baseline base standard audit accreditation procedure . Follow-up measurement do 12 month approval improvement plan . Participants : Primary care physicians The Netherlands . Interventions implement : improvement plan concern cardiovascular risk management , describe recently update national multidisciplinary evidence-based NHG / CBO guideline , consider patient establish cardiovascular disease . Implementation strategy : The national programme accreditation improvement general practice . This procedure consist package activity , include audit , feedback , improvement plan , follow-up . Outcome measure : Primary outcome percentages patient CVD acceptable systolic blood pressure cholesterol level ( quantified accord indicator accreditation ) use aspirin alternative . Secondary measure include clinical organisational indicator quality cardiovascular care , percentages patient cardiovascular disease whose risk factor assess receive specific medication . Economic evaluation : Incremental cost effectiveness ratio 's determined implementation strategy compare implementation . The analysis take societal perspective time horizon observe period well hypothetical 10 year period ( use model ) . Uncertainty related estimation examine sensitivity analyse bootstrapping . The long term economic evaluation base Markov modelling .</brief_summary>
