	<brief_title>Effects LY2189265 Glycemic Control Participants With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants trial randomize one LY2189265 dose ( 4 dos plan , range 0.1-1.5 milligram [ mg ] ) placebo . The main purpose assess dose-dependent effect new compound blood glucose period 12 week . Therefore , glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) choose primary efficacy measure . Several attribute glycemic control endocrine function pancreas assess secondary objective . These secondary objective use compare effect experimental compound placebo . Since LY2189265 early phase development , comprehensive safety assessment plan learn possible side-effects establish benefit/risk profile individual dos drug . The trial organize four phase : screening , lead-in period establish baseline status participant group , treatment period participant randomize 1 5 group ( 4 receive one LY2189265 dose , 1 group receive placebo ) , safety follow . Maximum 9 study visit plan . Study drug ( LY2189265 placebo ) administer weekly via subcutaneous ( SC ) injection . Rescue intervention allow randomization participant whose hyperglycemia reach pre-defined unacceptable high value . Participants rescue therapy remain study continue receive study drug . Participants receive rescue therapy include analysis population , measurement obtain prior begin rescue therapy include specify efficacy analysis . A 3-mg LY2189265 dose discontinue replace 1.5 mg dose base dose find Study H9X-MC-GBCF ; NCT00734474 . Except noted , data summary 3 discontinue 3-mg LY2189265 participant ( n=3 ) include due small number participant short treatment duration .</detailed_description>
