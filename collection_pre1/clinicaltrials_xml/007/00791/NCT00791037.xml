	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety infuse escalate dos HER2 specific T cell patient advance HER2+ breast cancer use ex vivo expand autologous T cell . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate extent HER2 specific T cell immunity boost generated individual infusion HER2 specific T cell . II . To evaluate long T cell immune augmentation persist vivo adoptive transfer HER2 specific T cell subsequent booster immunization . III . To determine development cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+ CD8+ epitope spread adoptive transfer HER2 specific T cell . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate potential anti-tumor effect HER2 specific T cell patient advance HER2+ breast cancer . II . To determine whether indium-labeled HER-2 specific T-cells traffic sit metastatic disease adoptively transfer use SPECT SPECT-CT imaging . III . To assess whether adoptively transfer HER-2 specific T-cells induce acute inflammation metastatic site disease assess development tumor inflammation second third infusion cell use PET-CT imaging . OUTLINE : This phase I/II , dose-escalation study ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific autologous T cell . Patients receive HER2/neu peptide vaccine admix sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) intradermally ( ID ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Beginning 2 week later , patient undergo leukapheresis isolate collect peripheral blood mononuclear cell T-cell expansion . Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day -1 autologous ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cell IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 7-10 day three treatment . Patients receive booster HER2/neu peptide vaccine 1 month final T-cell infusion , follow 2 additional booster vaccine 2-month interval . While study , patient may continue standard-of-care ( non-research ) treatment trastuzumab and/or lapatinib IV weekly every 3 week , except 7 day cyclophosphamide dose , treatment 1 treatment 2 least 7 day receive second T cell vaccine . ( Trastuzumab lapatinib require provide study ) . Before third T cell treatment HER2 specific T-cells label small sample patient 's T-cells indium-111 . Prior final infusion T-cells , patient FDG PET-CT perform . This scan repeat 48 hour T-cell infusion . In addition , patient would undergo SPECT SPECT-CT image 4 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour ( +/- 3 hour ) label cell infuse . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month follow year , twice year thereafter . This consist blood collection contact patient physician .</detailed_description>
