	<brief_summary>This study design determine long-term safety tolerability Fx-1006A well effect Fx-1006A clinical outcome patient ATTR-PN . All patient enroll extension study receive once-daily oral 20 mg Fx-1006A 12 month ; therefore , patient randomize placebo Study Fx-005 cross active drug ( Fx-1006A 20 mg ) study . However , patient family well clinical Investigators clinical site staff remain blinded original Fx-005 treatment assignment . It intend interruption study medication administration two study . The majority safety clinical outcome assessment identical evaluate Study Fx-005 . Additional assessment open-label extension study include 24-hour Holter monitoring skin biopsy IENF ; patient require provide write informed consent participate open-label extension study prior additional procedure perform . The value obtain procedure evaluation conduct Month 18 visit Study Fx-005 use Baseline value open-label extension study . The Baseline assessment IENF Holter monitoring may conduct either day Month 18 visit day Study Fx-005 , prior first Fx-1006A dose open-label extension study . Clinic Visits conduct Week 6 ( ± 2 day ) , Month 3 ( ± 1 week ) , Month 6 ( ± 2 week ) , Month 12 ( ± 2 week ) . Monthly telephone contact ( ± 1 week schedule date ) make month investigative site visit schedule ( Months 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ) assessment adverse event concomitant medication . Neurological evaluation NIS-LL perform Months 6 12 . The NIS-LL assess utilizing average two successive NIS-LL clinical assessment score obtain least 24 hour apart within one week period study visit . A dedicated neurologist require perform NIS-LL score across time-points individual patient enrol study . Quality life utilize Norfolk QOL-DN assess Months 6 12 ( base total score well five individual domain questionnaire ) . QST ( utilize CASE IV ) , NCS , HRDB , mBMI , echocardiography conducted Months 6 12 . Holter monitoring conduct Baseline Months 6 12 . Biopsies IENF obtain Baseline . Assessments troponin I NT-pro-BNP level make study visit . Blood sample pharmacokinetic assessment ( Fx-1006A concentration well calculate steady-state parameter ) pharmacodynamic assessment ( TTR stabilization ) collect Week 6 Months 6 12 . Safety tolerability assess throughout study . Vital sign , 12-lead ECG , blood urine sample clinical laboratory test ( serum chemistry , hematology , coagulation panel , urinalysis , urine pregnancy test ) , adverse event , concomitant medication assess study visit . Eye examination ( include fundal photography ) conduct Months 6 12 . Abbreviated physical examination conduct Week 6 , Months 3 6 , complete physical examination conduct Month 12 . All patient contact telephone 30 day ( ± 1 week ) last dose study medication assessment adverse event concomitant medication . Patients complete Month 12 visit open-label study may allow continue receive Fx-1006A compassionate use program . Patients discontinue study time enrollment ( i.e. , early termination ) final safety assessment perform time discontinuation . Any patient discontinue Month 6 visit safety clinical outcome assessment schedule Month 12 visit perform .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male nonpregnant female patient meet follow criterion eligible enrollment study : Patient complete Month 18 visit Study Fx005 . If female , patient postmenopausal , surgically sterilize , willing use acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide ) throughout study . ( A condom alone consider acceptable method birth control . ) If male female partner childbearing potential , willing use acceptable method birth control duration study . For female male , acceptable birth control must use least 3 month last dose study medication . Patient , opinion investigator , willing able comply study medication regimen study requirement . Patient agree participate another investigational drug device study participate openlabel extension study . Patients meet exclusion criterion enrol study : Chronic use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , define great 34 times/month ( ibuprofen nimesulide permit ) . If female , patient pregnant breast feeding .
