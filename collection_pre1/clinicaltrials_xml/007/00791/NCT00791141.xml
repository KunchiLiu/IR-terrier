	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label , uncontrolled phase II trial evaluate safety efficacy post-operative chemoradiation combination cetuximab squamous cell carcinoma head neck .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Cetuximab Chemoradiation Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced squamous cell carcinoma head neck still poor prognosis loco-regional recurrence frequently occur . Efforts make improve response rate survival different therapeutic regimen include concurrent chemo-radiotherapy sequential chemo-radiotherapy develop . To increase outcome patient locally advance SCCHN effective new treatment minimal toxicity need . Molecular target agent , demonstrate overlap toxicity commonly use chemotherapy agent , therefore investigate . The EGFR widely express high level SSCHN associate poor prognosis . Cetuximab already investigate combination radiotherapy chemotherapy patient head neck cancer . The immunoradiotherapy well tolerated side effect relate high dose irradiation . The common side effect mucositis dysphagia . Additionally , skin reaction appear sometimes frequently cetuximab administration . Grade 3 4 infusion reaction observe 3 % patient treat cetuximab . Based current promising result RCT patient locally advanced head neck cancer clinical result EGFR-antibodies plus RT , present study primarily design define acute grade 3/4 toxicity . We expect show effective result reduce risk distant metastasis , administration additional six month adjuvant cetuximab treatment , patient recurrent SCCHN .</detailed_description>
