	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib pemetrexed may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Sorafenib may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving sorafenib together pemetrexed cisplatin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose sorafenib give together pemetrexed cisplatin treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose sorafenib tosylate give combination pemetrexed disodium cisplatin patient advance non-squamous cell solid tumor malignancy include , limited , breast , lung , colon , pancreatic , prostate , head neck cancer sarcoma . Secondary - To characterize quantitative qualitative toxicity regimen patient . - To obtain preliminary information antitumor activity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study sorafenib tosylate . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate daily day 1-21 cisplatin IV 1-2 hour pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 8 week disease progression , every 3 month 6 month .</detailed_description>

Mesothelioma patient may enrol prior therapy requirement since cisplatin pemetrexed combination current standard care 1st line therapy . At least 21 day must pass previous systemic therapy ( least 6 week prior bevacizumab ) patient must recover toxic effect previous treatment prior study enrollment . Prior treatment cisplatin and/or pemetrexed allow , least 3 month must pass since last dose . Prior treatment sorafenib allow . Prior radiation therapy allow except whole pelvis . At least 14 day last radiation therapy treatment must recover acute toxic effect prior study enrollment . Measurable nonmeasurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance status 0 2 18 year age old Adequate organ function within 7 day study enrollment include follow : Adequate bone marrow reserve : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L ; platelet ≥100 x 10^9/L ; hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Hepatic : bilirubin ≤1.5 time upper limit normal ( × ULN ) ; alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3.0 × ULN ( ALP , AST , ALT ≤ 5× ULN acceptable liver tumor involvement ) Renal : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 45 . The creatinine clearance determine CockcroftGault formula : Males : cr cl ( mL ) /min ) = weight ( kg ) x ( 140age ) divide 72 x serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) Females : cr cl ( mL ) /min ) = weight ( kg ) x ( 140age ) x 0.85 divide 72 x serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) Coagulation : INR &lt; 1.5 PT/PTT within normal limit Patients receive anticoagulation treatment agent warfarin heparin may allow participate . For patient warfarin , INR measure prior initiation sorafenib monitor least weekly , define local standard care , INR stable .
