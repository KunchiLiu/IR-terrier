	<brief_title>Preventing Recurrence Thromboembolic Events Through Coordinated Treatment District Columbia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite significant advance prevention treatment cerebrovascular disease last decade , stroke remain third lead cause death lead cause adult disability United States . For population experience cerebrovascular event , risk future stroke greatly increase . The initiation effective secondary prevention strategy effective implement early ( disable stroke occurs ) , monitor frequently , maintain long-term cerebrovascular event . The Preventing Recurrence Thromboembolic Events Coordinated Treatment District Columbia ( PROTECT DC ) intervention use stroke navigator help people suffer stroke implement secondary prevention strategy . Stroke navigator lay person train provide education secondary prevention behavior , trained navigate health human service system . The goal help individual stroke obtain necessary service program engage secondary prevention behavior , ultimately , prevent recurrence stroke .</detailed_description>
