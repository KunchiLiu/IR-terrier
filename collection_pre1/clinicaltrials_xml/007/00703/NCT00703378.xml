	<brief_summary>Primary Objective 1 . To develop pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic ( PD ) model optimisation docetaxel dose Secondary Objectives 1 . To establish exposure-toxicity ( neutropenia ) relationship docetaxel 2 . To determine exposure breakpoint docetaxel toxicity base neutropenia PD model 3 . To identify demographic , pathophysiological and/or phenotypic covariates predict docetaxel clearance 4 . To prospectively validate PK-PD model optimisation docetaxel dosage determination PK variability toxicity</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Target Dosing Docetaxel Through Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Optimisation First Chemotherapeutic Cycle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Poor tolerance standard docetaxel dosage regimen use single agent Asians clearly demonstrate group 2 separate study . Neutropenia emerge prominent manifestation chemotherapy toxicity [ 12 , 20 ] . While attribute low docetaxel CL derive Asian patient , optimal dosage regimen take account extensive genetic polymorphism associate CYP3A4 yet establish . The use ketoconazole potent CYP3A4 modulator reduce pharmacokinetic variability docetaxel show &gt; 2-fold reduction docetaxel dosage , inter-individual variability CL significantly reduce . There also poor correlation docetaxel CL midazolam phenotyping CYP3A4 addition ketoconazole regimen [ 23 ] . Since use additional modulator fail achieve desire reduction pharmacokinetic variability , idea use low-dose docetaxel predict pharmacokinetic parameter appear feasible , safe appeal approach . The acute toxicity docetaxel , neutropenia , stomatitis , neurological toxicity fluid retention frequently associate 3 weekly weekly dosing schedule . This study design less toxic weekly schedule use PK/PD correlation . This information would utilize derive optimal dosage 3 weekly regimen follow since cumulative myelosuppression observe previous weekly docetaxel metastatic breast cancer [ 31 ] . Currently patient impair liver function manifest elevated baseline ALT/AST 1.5 institutional limit normal treat recommend dose docetaxel impaired clearance docetaxel . Theoretically , patient may benefit docetaxel treatment , dose need individualize base hepatic drug clearance avoid toxicity . To determine clinical usefulness strategy predict docetaxel clearance individualise dose base clearance PD model , patient certain extent liver dysfunction include study . They divide 3 group accord level AST/ALT SAP , total bilirubin , initial weekly dos well q3weekly dose low recommended dos patient normal liver function . Previous investigator report feasibility use erythromycin breath test vivo probe CYP3A activity docetaxel clearance patient liver dysfunction ( Baker SD et al Evaluation CYP3A activity predictor covariate docetaxel clearance Proceedings ASCO 2004 ; 128 : 2006abs ) . 2.4 Hypothesis The hypothesis study PK/PD guide dose docetaxel reduce variability docetaxel PK achieve maximum exposure desire within acceptable limit toxicity . At juncture , novel approach oncology fully exploit potential use low-dose docetaxel probe drug individualise optimise dosage subsequent chemotherapy treatment without use agent modulate predict drug metabolism clearance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm malignancy metastatic unresectable docetaxel indicate . 2 . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . 3 . With exception alopecia , fatigue , nausea asthenia , patient must resolution acute toxic effect prior surgery ' radiotherapy chemotherapy National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 ( see Appendix A ) grade &lt; 1 . 4 . Patients must ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % , see Appendix B ) . 5 . Patients must life expectancy great 3 month . 6 . Patients must normal renal marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/μl absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/μl platelets ≥100,000/μl haemoglobin ≥7g/dL creatinine ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal 7 . Patients abnormal liver function test ( AST/ALT ≤ 10 x institutional upper limit normal ; SAP &lt; 5x ULN ; total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN ) eligible enrolment . 8 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7days prior study enrollment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 3 . Patients rapidly progressive intracranial spinal metastatic disease ( include patient require corticosteroid CNS disease ) . 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition docetaxel agent use study . 5 . Patients prior medication know metabolized induce/inhibit CYP3A4 within 1 week ( see appendix C ) . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Pregnant woman exclude study docetaxel embryotoxic/fetotoxic potential abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother docetaxel , breastfeed discontinue mother treated docetaxel . These potential risk may also apply agent use study .</criteria>
