	<brief_summary>Severe disease human due bird influenza virus ( H5N1 ) lead concern virus may result widespread outbreak bird flu . The purpose study evaluate dose dose schedule 2 different type H5N1 vaccine . Participants randomly assign 1 9 possible vaccine group . All participant receive 2 dos Clade 1 , Clade 2 , combination Clade 1 2 Day 0 . All participant receive second dose vaccine different vaccine type study day 7 , 14 , 28 180 . Study participant include 500 healthy adult subject , age 18-49 year old , history prior H5 flu exposure vaccination . Study procedure may include medical history , physical exam , blood sampling . Subject participation may last 372 day . Several DMID study recently evaluate H5N1 vaccine healthy adult , 04-063 , 05-0090 , 05-0015 , 05-0043 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe disease human due avian influenza virus H5N1 subtype raise concern regard potential emergence virus pandemic form . Results early study suggest previous prim significantly affect response subsequent booster dos , even booster dos represent antigenic variant . Both length time prim revaccination , well antigenic relatedness prim revaccination antigen , may impact response . These issue could important impact pre-vaccination strategy prior emergence pandemic . This study evaluate immunogenicity different H5 variant . In study , `` different '' define clade 1 follow clade 1 , clade 1 follow clade 2 , clade 2 follow clade 2 , combination clade 1 &amp; 2 follow combination clade 1 &amp; 2 . In addition , study evaluate effect interval dose subsequent response , `` ultra-short '' interval define 7 14 day , `` short '' interval define 28 day `` long '' interval define 180 day . The study evaluate whether use long duration dose cross-clade prim result enhance immunogenicity . Primary objective : evaluate dose schedule unadjuvanted inactivated subvirion H5N1 vaccine belong different clade H5-naïve , healthy adult ; determine boost subject give inactivated influenza rg A/Vietnam/1203/04 vaccine heterologous antigen inactivate influenza rg A/Indonesia/05/05 result broader high immune response compare boost homologous antigen ; evaluate immune response 2 dos H5 vaccine give time &lt; 1 month apart . Secondary objective : determine safety 2 dos inactivate H5 vaccine healthy adult give different schedule antigen combination ; obtain additional information regard antibody response single dose ultra-short immunization schedule ; evaluate effect antibody level receive antigenic variant prim virus give booster simultaneously . The study conduct randomize , prospective control , multi-center trial . Approximately 500 healthy adult subject , age 18-49 , history prior H5 influenza exposure vaccination enrol . Subjects randomize receive varying schedule , ( 2 dos separate 7 , 14 , 28 180 day ) , clade unadjuvanted inactivated subvirion H5N1 vaccine .</detailed_description>
