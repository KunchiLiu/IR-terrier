	<brief_title>Waukesha Smiles : Dental Outreach Low-income Waukesha Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A. HYPOTHESIS / SPECIFIC AIMS : The purpose Waukesha Smiles : Dental Outreach Low-income Children improve oral health habit increase access primary preventive dental care low-income child city Waukesha . The typical form dental decay see child , also call dental `` caries , '' result transmissible infectious disease process enable poor oral hygiene dietary choices.1-5 When unchecked , process lead pain tooth loss , turn lead disfigurement , self-esteem problem , impaired nutrition , even systemic disease.3 , 6 Access basic dental care good oral health habit reduce preventable dental disease associate outcomes.7 However , poor oral health habit prevalent among child low socioeconomic strata.7-9 And limited access primary/preventive dental care common low income and/or minority child , represent major health risk specific populations.9 , 10 Self-pay care major barrier low-income families.9 , 10 Children Title 19-related dental insurance ( Medicaid ) also face similar barrier limit provider acceptance program : due low level reimbursement many dentist Waukesha area limit number Title-19 patient practice , accept insurance all.10 , 11 Furthermore , adequate access dental care alone sufficient assure oral health : regular dental visit compensate poor oral health habit . The Waukesha County Dental Clinic ( WCDC ) open January 2008 mission serve low-income uninsured underinsured county resident . This new clinic serve critical function community . However , despite increased access care Waukesha County Dental Clinic provide , expect many eligible low-income Waukesha child still receive need dental care variety reason . These include : lack awareness clinic ; persistent concern financial burden ; lack understanding benefit routine dental care ; logistical barrier ; language cultural barrier . Moreover , expect basic oral health habit could improve Waukesha child , need anything preventive dental care would diminish . We hypothesize Educational Intervention , consist brief monthly classroom presentation oral health plus monthly distribution new toothbrush tooth paste , lead improve oral health outcome among low-income 3rd grade student compare Referral Intervention wherein child receive detailed referral assistance find dentist oral health screen exam . Our primary outcome rate untreated dental caries , proportion child need early urgent dental care . B. DESIGN/ METHODS : Aim/Objective 1 : Assemble cohesive study team , include parent advisory board bilingual study staff oral health outreach intervention . Aim/Objective 2 : Develop prepare Educational Referral Interventions Aim/Objective 3 : Conduct intervention two phase , use cross-over approach child study receive intervention . Aim/Objective 4 : Evaluate , sustain , disseminate partnership child oral health improvement . Waukesha Smiles compare two different school-based strategy improve oral health among 400 3rd grade child 9 different elementary school city Waukesha high proportion low-income student . All student receive screen oral health exam begin end intervention ; parent provide exam result recommendation care . Intervention group divide school , child school receive intervention ( close 200 child per group feasible ) . However , maximize community benefit project allay concern participation research , use crossover design school swap intervention first 12 month ( Phase I ) . Thus Intervention Phase II provide intervention duration opposite school , pre- post-intervention oral screening exam . INTERVENTION PHASE I , First Cohort : Participants Referral Intervention arm receive specific referral dental care indicate baseline exam ; detail information Waukesha County Dental Clinic ( WCDC ) , new clinic opening serve uninsured low-income county resident ; reminder active follow-up study staff assist child parent overcome barrier access recommend care . INTERVENTION PHASE I , Second Cohort : The Educational Intervention arm consist monthly classroom visit dental education team ( dental hygienist plus assistant ) provide brief oral health education module , distribute new toothbrush new tube toothpaste month . On first visit , participant give timer promote proper brush duration . In INTERVENTION PHASE II , first second cohort swap intervention , allow child study receive intervention . C. VARIABLES ( predictor / outcome ; stop rule / endpoint ) D. STATISTICS : We use McNemar 's test basic statistical test method determine result pre- post-intervention oral health assessment exams significantly different term prevalence primary outcome : untreated caries need early/urgent dental care . Because group randomize , order directly compare difference outcomes intervention ( Referral vs. Education ) construct logistic regression model allow adjustment multiple baseline difference group ; variable model include school attend , low-income status , parental education level . Using descriptive statistic also analyze ( ) parental survey change oral health knowledge/attitude/behavior , change perceive barrier dental care , ( b ) rate follow-through recommend dental care , ( c ) rate Emergency Department visit two local hospital pediatric dental problem patient zip code lie school ' catchment area . We seek track Emergency visit patient name . Family Medicine resident ' experience project evaluate rotation . Lastly , feedback give study team , community partner , investigator , seek determine feasibility sustain one intervention Waukesha school , determine best disseminate result others . E. RISKS : We believe risk study relatively minimal , include : 1. possible embarrassment child due identification dental need oral health assessment 2. unable receive recommend dental care despite assistance referral , availability new clinic catering low-income Medicaid patient , etc . 3. transmission infection oral health assessment 4. breech confidentiality F. BENEFITS : This project expand sustain success 2004 HWPP plan grant ( `` Creating Community-Academic Partnership Improve Oral Health Waukesha County '' ) . This ongoing partnership lead development Waukesha County Dental Clinic address unmet oral health need . This success evidence productive work relationship long-term commitment financial professional resource partner accord particular strength . This productive partnership continue meet least biweekly project , demonstrate commitment ability attain element Community-Academic Partnership Model realistic assessment needs/barriers , ability garner broad support , share passion improve oral health , create attain measurable goal , mutual trust , share resource . We measure impact project several key outcome . At end intervention period , analyze interval difference oral health screen exam result study arm ; specific attention pay difference group rate untreated caries , appearance new interval lesion , regression early lesion . We measure proportion child require early urgent dental care . We also track outcome referral WCDC , pediatric Emergency Department visit acute dental problem local hospital use zip code method . To maximize health impact project , develop how-to manual resource guide best practice allow Wisconsin community take program `` shelf . '' In addition , family medicine resident take lesson learn back underserved area tend practice .</detailed_description>
