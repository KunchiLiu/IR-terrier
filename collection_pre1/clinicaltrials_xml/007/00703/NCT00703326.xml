	<brief_summary>The objective study compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) drug combination ramucirumab plus docetaxel placebo plus docetaxel previously untreated participant human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative , unresectable , locally-recurrent metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Study Docetaxel + Ramucirumab Placebo Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Female participant least 18 year age histologically cytologically confirm , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative breast adenocarcinoma metastatic locally-recurrent inoperable curative intent randomize . Participants may receive chemotherapy metastatic locally-recurrent , inoperable breast cancer . It anticipate 1113 participant randomize 371 participant docetaxel plus placebo arm 742 participant docetaxel plus ramucirumab ( IMC-1121B ) arm . There approximately 250 center North South America , Europe , Asia , Middle East , Africa , Australia , New Zealand . On Day 1 21-day cycle , participant receive docetaxel 75 mg/m² one-hour I.V . infusion follow either ramucirumab ( IMC-1121B ) 10 mg/kg placebo 10 mg/kg one-hour I.V . infusion . Each cycle repeat every 21 day . Treatment continue evidence progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal criterion meet . Participants discontinue study treatment either ramucirumab ( IMC-1121B ) placebo may continue receive docetaxel .</detailed_description>
