	<brief_title>A Safety Effectiveness Study Telaprevir Chronic , Genotype 1 , Hepatitis C Patients That Failed Previous Standard Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled Phase III trial telaprevir patient chronic Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) , genotype 1 , infection fail prior treatment standard treatment . Standard treatment define treatment Peg-INF RBV . The trial design compare efficacy , safety , tolerability 2 regimen telaprevir ( without delay start ) combine standard treatment versus standard treatment alone . The trial consist screen period approximately 4 week , 48-week treatment period , 24-week follow-up period . Patients eligible enroll trial ( 1 ) undetectable HCV Ribonucleic Acid ( RNA ) level end prior course standard treatment achieve response ( viral relapsers ) , ( 2 ) never undetectable HCV RNA level end prior course standard treatment ( non-responders ) . Approximately 650 patient ( 350 prior relapsers 300 prior non-responders ) randomize 2:2:1 ratio one 3 treatment group : Treatment group A receive telaprevir standard treatment 12 week ; follow placebo standard treatment 4 week ; follow standard treatment 32 week . Treatment group B receive placebo standard treatment 4 week ; follow telaprevir standard treatment 12 week ; follow standard treatment 32 week . Treatment group C receive placebo standard treatment 16 week ; follow standard treatment 32 week . In telaprevir regimen ( A B ) , patient receive 12 week 750 mg telaprevir every 8 hour along 48 week standard treatment . Telaprevir placebo give mouth dose 750 mg every 8 hour 16 week . Peg-INF give injection skin dose 180 mcg every week 48 week . RBV give mouth dose either 1000 1200 mg ( depend body weight ) two time per day 48 week .</detailed_description>
