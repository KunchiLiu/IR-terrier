	<brief_summary>The study aim show candidate malaria vaccine GMZ2 safe already publicly use vaccine rabies . 30 Gabonese child age 1-5 year enrol randomly allocate receive either malaria vaccine rabies vaccine without investigator participant know receive . They receive 3 dos one month interval , follow one year evaluate safety parameter . 30 100µg dos candidate malaria vaccine GMZ 2 evaluate safety . This second time candidate malaria vaccine GMZ 2 test Africa , first time Gabonese adult product find safe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background . GMZ2 recombinant hybrid Glutamate Rich Protein ( GLURP ) Merozoite Surface Protein 3 ( MSP 3 ) .This product develop State Serum Institute/EMVI Denmark Batch release Henogen Belgium . The phase Ia trial malaria naive volunteer do Germany , Tuebingen University . This phase Ia trial establish safety vaccine also assist select best dosage ( 10 , 30 100 µg ) . The dosage best safety immunogenicity profile test phase Ib trial Gabon , include phase Ib trial child . Objectives : Primary objective : To evaluate safety reactogenicity three dose 30 100µg GMZ2 , adsorb aluminium hydroxide , comparison three dos control vaccine ( rabies ) , healthy Gabonese child age 1-5 year . Secondary objective : To assess humoral immune response vaccine antigens GMZ2 , GLURP MSP3 measure total IgG concentration IgG isotypes GMZ2 ELISA . To assess B-cell memory memory B-cell ELISPOT . Exploratory Objectives : To assess functionality immune response measure Growth Inhibition P. falciparum presence absence Monocytes , measure recognition native antigen P. falciparum IFA . Study Design : Phase Ib double-blind , randomise , control trial three group one study site ; rabies vaccine,30µg 100 µg GMZ 2 vaccine .</detailed_description>
