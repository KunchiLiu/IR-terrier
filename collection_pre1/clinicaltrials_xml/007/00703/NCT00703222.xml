This protocol carry Phase I/IIa study evaluate safety toxicity add previously unstudied , unmodified , irradiated neuroblastoma cell line ( SKNLP ) study , safe dose gene modify , IL-2/Lptn secrete neuroblastoma cell line SJNB-JF-IL2/Lptn give vaccine patient diagnose high risk neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Of Immunization With Lymphotactin And Interleukin 2 Gene Modified Neuroblastoma Tumor Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TREATMENT PLAN : Standard Chemotherapy Neuroblastoma : Standard therapy neuroblastoma give 3 phase : induction , consolidation , maintenance . For enrollment vaccine study patient physician must anticipate therapy include consolidation high dose chemotherapy stem cell rescue . They eligible enrollment phase I phase II trial vaccination gene modify unmodified , allogeneic neuroblastoma cell line . Patients receive Induction , Consolidation , Maintenance therapy per institutional standard . A general description therapy follow : - Induction : Induction consist multiple cycle induction chemotherapy harvest autologous stem cell immediately follow particular cycle chemotherapy per institutional standard . Local control tumor radiation therapy and/or surgery occur follow cycle induction chemotherapy immediately prior consolidation therapy . - Consolidation : Consolidation must consist high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell rescue ( HDT/SCR ) . - Maintenance : Starting day +90 HDT/SCR , patient treat Isotretinoin ( Cis-Retinoic Acid , CRA ) . VACCINE DOSING : Vaccine component SJNB-JF-IL2 SJNB-JF-Lptn dose 1x10e7 cells/m2 . This give conjunction escalate dose SKNLP vaccine phase I portion study . In phase II portion study , dose SJNB-JF-IL2 SJNB-JF-Lptn give conjunction high dose SKNLP determine phase I portion . Vaccination administer inpatient outpatient basis . Patient notify dose vaccine cell receive enrol study . Phase I Dose Escalation Component : While investigator suspect addition second irradiate , unmodified neuroblastoma tumor cell line previously test SJNB-JF gene modify cell line affect safety profile vaccine , SKNLP test previously vaccine study , investigator perform abbreviate dose escalation study combine vaccine ass safety . The investigator know vaccine give patient whose neuroblastoma return safe . The vaccine give patient treated virus make cytokine . The investigator never use 2nd cell group patient . Because , investigator plan treat 3 6 patient low dose cell see add second cell line safe give . - Dose Level 1 ( 3-6 patient ) 1x10e6 cells/m2/vaccination dose SKNLP Unmodified Neuroblastoma Cell Line Vaccine Component - Dose Level 2 ( 3-6 patient ) 1x10e7 cells/m2/vaccination dose SKNLP Unmodified Neuroblastoma Cell Line Vaccine Component - SJNB-JF-IL2 SJNB-JF-Lptn cell dose 1x10e7 cells/m2/vaccination Duration Therapy : In absence treatment delay due adverse event , treatment may continue immunization per treatment plan 12 vaccination one follow criterion applies : - Disease progression - Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment - Unacceptable adverse event ( ) include limited grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity accord CTCAE v3.0 . Grade 3 rigors/chills tolerate 48-72 hour attribute vaccination . - Patient decide withdraw study - General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgement investigator .</detailed_description>
