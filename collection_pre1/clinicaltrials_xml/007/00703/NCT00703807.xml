	<brief_summary>Endometrial cancer common malignancy female reproductive tract . The majority patient endometrial cancer diagnose early stage cure surgery without adjuvant radiotherapy . However , significant number patient present metastatic disease outside pelvis develop recurrent disease primary therapy . mTOR inhibitor show promising agent reduce tumor growth vitro vivo , several solid cancer . Inhibitors mTOR primarily cytostatic cancer cell ; combination therapy cytotoxic chemotherapeutics biologic agent may prove advantageous use drug . mTOR inhibition rapamycin analogue demonstrate vitro antiproliferative activity endometrial AN3 CA HEC-1-A tumor cell , inhibition proliferation find concentration dependent . Topotecan active agent treatment advance recurrent endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologicallyconfirmed advanced recurrent endometrial cancer Patients must refractory standard therapy curative standard therapy exist , consider . Metastatic disease , present , progress require palliative treatment within 4 week enrollment base clinical assessment investigator . Development new lesion increase preexist lesion bone scintigraphy , CT , MRI physical examination . Patients sole criterion progression increase biochemical marker , e.g. , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , increase symptom , eligible . Age ≥ 18 year WHO performance status ≤ 2 Adequate bone marrow function show : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L , Hb &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN INR &lt; 1.3 ( &lt; 3 anticoagulant ) ALT AST ≤ 2.5x ULN ( ≤ 5x ULN patient liver metastasis ) Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x mg/dL Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Signed informed consent Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy , etc . ) Patients , major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) patient may require major surgery course study Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent , except corticosteroid daily dosage equivalent prednisone ≤ 20 mg . However , patient receive corticosteroid must stable dosage regimen minimum 4 week prior first treatment RAD001 . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastases Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease severely impaired lung function uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 x ULN active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis A known history HIV seropositivity Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Patients active , bleed diathesis Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . If barrier contraceptive use , must continue throughout trial sex . Hormonal contraceptives acceptable sole method contraception . ( Women childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration RAD001 ) Patients receive prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Patients know hypersensitivity RAD001 ( everolimus ) rapamycins ( sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients History noncompliance medical regimen Patients unwilling unable comply protocol</criteria>
