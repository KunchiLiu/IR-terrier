	<detailed_description>The polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) affect approximately 6-10 % woman childbearing age , i.e. , 3.5-5.5 million woman United States . PCOS common endocrine disturbance young woman major cause ( 75 % ) anovulatory infertility United States . We hypothesize woman polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) G/G genotype single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) _ rs8111699 STK11 exhibit significantly great response metformin , term ovulation , compare woman either C/G C/C genotype . Specifically , anticipate frequency ovulation ( defined number ovulations/9 months/subject ) least 2-fold high woman G/G STK11 genotype compare woman either C/G C/C genotype . To test hypothesis , obtain DNA STK11 genotyping 36 woman PCOS treat metformin carefully monitor ovulation 9 month . STK11 genotype status determine , ovulation rate G/G , G/C C/C genotype group compare one another . Our goal identify gene predict modify response commonly prescribe medication allow physician well choose among exist therapy individualize treatment . While metformin show increase ovulatory frequency PCOS widely use clinical practice treat infertility , substantial number woman either respond slow respond metformin treatment . Knowing specific STK11 genotype predicts effect metformin ovulation would facilitate efficient effective treatment infertility PCOS .</detailed_description>
