	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine immune modify drug ( Ontak ) alone part vaccine therapy produce remission patient advanced ovarian cancer . This research do want find new therapy treatment relapse refractory ( resistant ordinary treatment ) ovarian cancer . The use ONTAK vaccine therapy research . A new experimental approach treat refractory relapse ovarian cancer involve use patient immune system kill cancer cell . These immune cell call monocyte harvest blood . The process Leukapheresis collect monocyte call Dendritic Cells . This usually 3 hour process do comfort hospital bed apheresis lab , similar give blood donation . Approximately 300cc 's collected process , equivalent 10 ounce blood . Once dendritic cell collect - special laboratory grows process vaccine use patient 's tumor cell . This preparation give back patient hopefully stimulate immune system kill cancer cell . This type treatment consider biological research . This study also involve drug call ONTAK , make use certain protein diphtheria toxin interleukin-2 ( chemotherapy drug ) . This drug act immune suppress cell normally present body make vaccine therapy possibly less effective . Ontak help set immune system boost vaccine injection . The use Ontak follow vaccine stimulate tumor kill immune cell do ovarian cancer research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients advance ovarian carcinoma fail initial curative chemotherapy attempt evaluate time relapse tumor debulking surgery prior initiation salvage chemotherapy . If appropriate , sample collect tumor lysate preparation vaccination per exist Loyola protocol . Lysates may also produce collection malignant effusion perform palliation symptom . Patients receive palliative chemotherapy maximum tumor cytoreduction . Patients sufficient tumor cell collect DC-based vaccine production undergo leukapheresis DC cell production . Once complete , patient randomly assign one two treatment group : Cohort ( Group ) 1 - Administration single dose Ontak 18 μg/kg follow DC vaccination 1 x 106 tumor lysate KLH-loaded immature DCs inguinal node identify ultrasound guidance total three injection two week interval ; Cohort ( Group ) 2 - Identical DC vaccination Group 1 without Ontak pre-treatment . Patients collection tumor cell lysate preparation possible assign Cohort ( Group ) 3 , administration Ontak dose without vaccination . In pilot study plan treat 12 patient group two-year period time . Therapy begin four week chemotherapy completion , give achieve maximum cytoreduction prior protocol therapy initiation</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologic cytologic diagnosis epithelial ovarian cancer Patients eligible fail enter complete remission induction therapy relapse period remission eligible otherwise curative therapy Patients must receive antineoplastic chemotherapy immunotherapy four week precede tumor excision ; six week nitrosoureas mitomycinC Patients must receive irradiation four week prior removal tumor previously irradiate tumor deposit may use tumor lysate development dendritic cell vaccine Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use Ontak combination dendritic cell vaccination patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study may eligible future pediatric phase 2 combination trial Life expectancy great three month Karnofsky performance status must &gt; 70 % ; ( see appendix A ) Patients must adequate baseline hematopoetic function define . The following lab must draw within four week tumor harvest and/or receive dose Ontak total white blood cell count &gt; 2,500/mm3 absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mm3 absolute lymphocyte count &gt; 500/mm3 platelet count &gt; 80,000/mm3 Patients must adequate baseline organ function define . The following lab must draw within four week tumor harvest and/or receive dose Ontak : total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dl prothrombin time ( INR ) ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal albumin &gt; 3.0 mg/dl If patient recent surgery , must fully recover effect surgery . The effect Ontak develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Additional eligibility requirement vaccine therapy initiation : Patients eligible tumor collection vaccine strategy , select receive ONTAK alone ( group 3 ) tumor available enroll ay time fulfill Eligibility Criteria . Prevaccination goal establish Minimal Residual Disease state ( MRD maximum tumor diameter residual disease ≤ 1cm ) . This achieve surgery and/or salvage chemotherapy . Ontak administration and/or vaccine therapy commence least 4 week completion last day aforementioned therapy Patients randomize group 1 2 must tumor available preparation tumor lysate vaccine Women member race ethnic group eligible trial Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients receive prior antitumor vaccine ineligible History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition monocolonal antibody Murine source Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , active bleeding , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled bronchospasm , hypertension , hyperglycemia , hypercalcemia ; psychiatric illness/social situation opinion investigator would compromise patient 's ability tolerate treatment affect compliance Pregnant lactate woman exclude study . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant , breastfeed discontinue mother treated Ontak . These potential risk may also apply agent use study Patients HIV infection , AIDS , hepatitis B surface antigen positivity , exclude trial . Patients combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy History corticosteroid use four week precede entry onto clinical trial , requirement ongoing corticosteroid use study period Patients expect require therapeutic anticoagulation trial period Patients know brain metastasis</criteria>
