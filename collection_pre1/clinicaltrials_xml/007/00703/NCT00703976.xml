	<brief_title>Radiation , Cetuximab Pemetrexed With Without Bevacizumab Locally Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Patients squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( HNSCC ) increasingly treat primary chemoradiotherapy . The incorporation novel target therapy chemoradiotherapy major interest since may potentially improve efficacy without significantly increase toxicity . Radiation cetuximab , chimeric anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody , emerge standard non-surgical therapy stage III/IV HNSCC . Bevacizumab , anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody currently investigate HNSCC promising result . A phase II study investigate combination pemetrexed bevacizumab recurrent metastatic HNSCC currently ongoing institution encourage result ( UPCI # 05-002 ) . In addition , complete phase I trial radiation , cetuximab plus pemetrexed ( UPCI # 05-005 ) . Pemetrexed dose escalate successive cohort patient 3 dose level : start dose level ( 0 ) 350 mg/m2 , dose level ( -1 ) 200 mg/m2 , dose level ( +1 ) 500 mg/m2 . Currently three patient treat dose level +1 ( pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 ) pemetrexed dose study . No dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) observe dose level , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination regimen previously non-irradiated patient . Specific aim To evaluate progression-free survival 2 year ( primary endpoint ) , locoregional distant disease-free survival , overall survival , toxicity quality life combination radiation , cetuximab pemetrexed without bevacizumab patient locally advanced HNSCC . Also , plan collect tumor tissue previous diagnostic procedure baseline blood specimen future correlative study . Subject population We enroll patient previously untreated stage III/IV squamous cell carcinoma undifferentiated carcinoma head neck ( except nasopharynx unknown primary ) . Patients active bleed due HNSCC history persistent bleed due HNSCC require major intervention ( surgery embolization ) control . Please see section 3 detailed eligibility criterion . Treatment plan Patients randomize two arm . In arm A , patient treat radiation 2Gy/day 7 week total 70 Gy , cetuximab 250mg/m2 weekly radiation , load dose 400mg/m2 one week prior start radiation , pemetrexed 500mg/m2 every 21 day 3 cycle . In arm B , patient treat regimen addition bevacizumab 15mg/kg every 21 day 3 cycle ( see section 5 detailed treatment plan dose modification ) . Statistical design sample size Phase II , randomize , multi-center study progression-free survival 2 year primary endpoint . The historical control 2-year progression-free survival 46 % radiation plus cetuximab alone . We assume 2 year progression free survival 64 % ( 40 % relative improvement progression-free survival historical control ) worthy test . We require 40 evaluable patient per arm total 80 patient . Alpha = 0.1 , beta = 0.1 ; test one-tailed .</detailed_description>
