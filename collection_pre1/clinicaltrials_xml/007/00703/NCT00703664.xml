	<brief_title>Bortezomib Vorinostat Treating Patients With Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma Recurrent and/or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate response rate mantle cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma bortezomib vorinostat combination therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety tolerability study regimen . II . Observe progression-free survival response duration . III . Observe relationship pretreatment lymphoma cell nuclear v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A ( relA ) response . OUTLINE : Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-5 8-12 . Patients also receive bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
