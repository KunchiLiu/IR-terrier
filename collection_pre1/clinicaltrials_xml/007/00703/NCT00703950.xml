	<brief_title>Sucking Pattern Preterm Infants Using Cup Bottle Before Breastfeeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breastfeeding well method promote adequate growth development preterm infant . However , sometimes preterm infant need supplement mother milk formula use another method . The cup bottle use neonatal unit , however still evidence determine best feed method , must safe , efficient jeopardize breast feeding . The aim study evaluate effect use bottle cup breast sucking pattern . The intervention use bottle cup feed preterm infant supplement breastfeed randomization . Nowadays , bottle feed conventional method wish compare suck pattern use bottle cup . As secondary endpoint , weight gain , day life begin full oral feeding , length hospital stay breast feed rate observe . In order achieve aim , blind randomized clinical trial do 96 low birth weight infant , group randomly select breast fed get supplementary food use cup another get supplementary food use bottle . The trial 's inclusion criterion : birth weight &lt; 1500 g ( low birth weight infant ) , gestational age 26 32 full week , absence congenital anomaly face , head neck , without severe asphyxia ( Apgar &lt; 5 5th minute ) , negative test AIDS , absence pulmonary chronic disease , mother willing breastfeed . Exclusion criterion : intraventricular hemorrhage ( degree III IV ) , necrotizing enterocolitis , infection begin trial . Once newborns trial clinically stable ( normal blood pressure without need oxygen ) volume intake least 100 ml/Kg/day milk orogastric tube , receive oral-motor stimulation stimulation program previously publish ( 2002 ) . Once newborn meet criteria begin oral feeding , instrumental assessment non-nutritive suck nutritive sucking carry . Intra-oral pressure assess non-nutritive suck use pressure monitoring device gloved finger : intra-oral negative pressure register use pressure transducer insert catheter tip gloved little finger . This catheter connect second pressure transducer . Simultaneously , breathe ( respiratory flow ) measure use pneumotachograph couple nasal Prong . Two minute suck collected moment newborn respond search reflex grab finger . During nutritive suck assessment , respiration ( respiratory flow ) measure use pneumotachograph couple nasal Prong . At time intra-oral sucking pressure record pressure transducer connect catheter locate mother 's breast . Nutritive suck take place first 5 minute breastfeed . After first assessment conclude , newborn randomly assign either group use cup bottle supplementary feeding use randomized block design . Assessments repeat discharge hospital . The study take place Fernandes Figueira Institute approve Institutional Review Board .</detailed_description>
