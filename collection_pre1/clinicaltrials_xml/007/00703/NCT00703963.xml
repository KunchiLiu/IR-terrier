	<brief_summary>Patients receive mechanical heart valve replace diseased heart valve must take anticoagulation medicine rest life , monitor level anticoagulation . Until recently , test level anticoagulation perform medical laboratory hospital . The purpose study see patient test level anticoagulation home call doctor result well control anticoagulation compare patient whose anticoagulation check physician .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improved Time Therapeutic Range With Patient Self-Testing Their INR Compared Usual Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prosthetic replacement diseased heart valve routine procedure , mechanical heart valves excellent hemodynamic performance durability . However , mechanical valve thrombogenic , necessitate lifelong anticoagulation . Hazards anticoagulation include bleed excessive thromboembolism intensity anticoagulation recommend level . Monitoring level anticoagulation accomplish analyze International Normalized Ratio . Until recently , perform medical laboratory hospital , recent literature suggest patient self-testing oral anticoagulation improve patient compliance , medical outcome , quality life . The objective study evaluate time therapeutic range patient self-test INR compare patient receive usual care . Additionally , evaluate educational component corollaries self-testing . Two hundred consecutively enrol adult , undergone implantation mechanical heart valve , randomize either self-testing usual care . Those randomized self-testing group undergo self-testing instruction prior hospital dismissal . For three month hospital discharge , subject record INR result obtain self-testing prescribed primary physician . They submit record INR result complete survey .</detailed_description>
