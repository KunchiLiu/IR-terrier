	<brief_title>Study Role Decompression Lower Extremity Nerves Treatment Patients With Symptomatic Diabetic Neuropathy With Chronic Nerve Compression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dr. Shai Rozen , work physician Internal Medicine , Neurology , Physical Medicine Rehabilitation conduct clinical study patient painful diabetic neuropathy . Specifically , regard efficacy peripheral nerve decompression low extremity select group patient may superimpose nerve compression addition diabetic neuropathy . Initial data support success rate around 80 % term significant alleviation pain restoration least protective sensation long term follow ups suggest decrease prevalence infection , ulceration , amputation . Potential candidate study patient symptomatic painful diabetic neuropathy respond medical treatment ( glucose control , pain medication ) continue severe pain . It think today one third patient diabetic neuropathy may superimpose nerve compression nerve leg , word nerve may press surround tissue . This nerve compression might contribute pain , often loss sensation bottom foot . The principle similar carpal tunnel syndrome pressure nerve wrist . Carpal tunnel syndrome see 14-30 % patient diabetes compare 2 % general population . This study involve one year close care follow-up . As part study , regular evaluation foot care specialist Physical Medicine Rehabilitation , receive glucose management tip Diabetic Nurse Educator , also specialize , non-invasive test Neurology department . The care would receive part study highly exceptional due various department involve dedication research . Initial data support success rate around 80 % term significant alleviation pain restoration least protective sensation long term follow ups suggest decrease prevalence infection , ulceration , amputation . Potential candidate study patient symptomatic painful diabetic neuropathy respond medical treatment ( glucose control , pain medication ) least one year continue severe pain . Dr. Shai Rozen principal investigator study , Julia Kalayanamit clinical coordinator . We happy speak would like information study , include appointment , schedule visit activity .</detailed_description>
