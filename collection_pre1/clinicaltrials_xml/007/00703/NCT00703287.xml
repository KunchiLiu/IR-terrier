This include newly diagnose patient choose botulinum toxin injection OR patient receive botulinum toxin ( either patient preference previous lack effect ) provide plan remain botulinum toxin one year duration trial . There probably patient feel justified include treatment offer presently unknown whether physiotherapy require botulinum toxin weaken muscle order effect . Anecdotal report suggest effective even without botulinum toxin . However , small number receive botulinum toxin analyse separate subgroup initially check whether response significantly different receive botulinum toxin . Patients follow criterion exclude : 1 . Secondary cervical dystonia ( e.g . acute onset follow trauma secondary drug ) 2 . A fixed cervical dystonia may imply psychogenic component . 3 . Radicular myelopathic feature cervical manipulation may dangerous . 4 . Patients know fused cervical vertebra previous xrays 5 . Previous use Bleton technique . 6 . Deep brain stimulation cervical dystonia . 7 . Dementia . 8 . Unable comply visit physiotherapy assessment .</criteria>
