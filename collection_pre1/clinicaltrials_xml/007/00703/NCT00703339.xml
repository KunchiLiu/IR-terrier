	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish single-dose tolerability inhale treprostinil sodium idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) patient pulmonary hypertension , explore acute hemodynamic effect range tolerable dos . The safety pharmacodynamic information obtain study inform design conduct future study inhale treprostinil sodium population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Inhaled Treprostinil Sodium Treatment Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multi-center , open-label , four-cohort study subject pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) associate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) . Each cohort four subject receive single dose inhale treprostinil sodium . Cohorts enrol sequentially , start low dose 18 mcg . Each cohort escalate 18 mcg increment , result four cohort 18 , 36 , 54 , 72 mcg dos . Decisions escalate next dose cohort base upon data previous complete low dose cohort four subject . Approximately 16 subject expect receive study drug , approximately four center United States expertise IPF participate study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>35 80 year age Male female Diagnosis IPF 1 . Investigator diagnosis base history , physical examination , HRCT , pulmonary function test 2 . Clinical symptom IPF least three month prior Visit 1 3 . High Resolution CT scan show definite probable IPF ( time past ) . Bibasilar reticular abnormality minimal ground glass opacity HRCT scan must also present ( time past ) 4 . Surgical lung biopsy show usual interstitial pneumonia , transbronchial lung biopsy diagnostic alternative condition . For patient young 50 year , surgical lung biopsy require ( time past ) 5 . FVC ≥ 30 % &lt; 70 % predict value within three month prior Visit 1 6 . DLCO ≥ 15 % &lt; 70 % predict value within three month prior Visit 1 . Diagnosis PH 1 . Previously document radiographic echocardiographic finding suggestive pulmonary hypertension 2 . Prior right heart catheterization diagnostic precapillary pulmonary hypertension . [ The presence precapillary pulmonary hypertension verify right heart catheterization Study Visit 3 , enrollment administration study drug ] . No change concomitant medication prescribe treat PAH IPF 30 day Visit 1 Females childbearing potential may participate currently pregnant lactate either one following : 1 . Surgically sterile 2 . At least 1 year postmenopausal 3 . Practicing acceptable method birth control least 30 prior Visit 1 plan continue method duration participation study . An echocardiogram perform Visit 2 . Only subject Visit 2 echocardiographic finding strongly suggest presence pulmonary hypertension , proceed Visit 3 . Acceptable finding include follow : 1 . TR velocity great 3.5 m/sec 2 . TR velocity great 3.0 m/sec right ventricular enlargement dysfunction A right heart catheterization perform Visit 3 . Only subject Visit 3 right heart catheterization finding establish presence pulmonary hypertension proceed enrollment study drug administration . Acceptable finding must include following : 1. mean PA pressure equal great 25 mm HG 2. pulmonary capillary wedge pressure equal le 15 mm Hg 3. pulmonary vascular resistance great 3 mmHg/min A subject eligible inclusion study ANY follow criterion apply : History know suspect pulmonary embolism deep venous thrombosis Clinical evidence leftsided heart disease Presence atrial fibrillation ( determine 12 lead ECG Visit 1 2 ) Other medical condition drug exposure know associated pulmonary fibrosis ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , scleroderma , etc . ) pulmonary arterial hypertension ( e.g. , connective tissue disease , congenital heart disease , portal hypertension , HIV infection , drug toxin , etc . ) Upper low respiratory infection within 30 day prior Visit 1 Hospitalization respiratory illness within 30 day prior Visit 1 Diagnosis clinically significant illness , opinion investigator , might put subject risk harm participation study might adversely effect interpretation study data . ( e.g. , significant liver kidney disease , etc . ) History recurrent symptom might , opinion investigator , adversely effect interpretation study data ( e.g. , severe headache , diarrhea , jaw pain , syncope , nausea , vomit , etc . ) Current treatment medication approve US FDA treat pulmonary hypertension ( e.g. , epoprostenol ( Flolan ) , treprostinil ( Remodulin ) , iloprost ( Ventavis ) , bosentan ( Tracleer ) , ambrisentan ( Letairis ) , sildenafil ( Revatio ) , etc. , ) , tadalafil ( Cialis ) Current treatment anticoagulant A reactive screen hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibody , HIV antibody test Visit 1 . Use inhaled tobacco product significant history drug abuse within 90 day prior Visit 1 The subject echocardiogram perform Visit 2 demonstrate finding indicative leave ventricular valvular disease . Findings consider evidence leave ventricular valvular disease , therefore exclude subject proceed Visit 3 follow : 1 . LVEF &lt; 55 % 2 . Moderate Severe mitral regurgitation aortic regurgitation 3 . Any mitral stenosis aortic stenosis 4 . Grade 2 3 diastolic dysfunction Doppler Use investigational drug , participation investigational study within 30 day prior Visit 1 .</criteria>
