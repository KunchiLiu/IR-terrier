	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Sorafenib ( Nexavar ) Combination With Gemcitabine Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , also know primary liver cancer , fifth common cancer world . It responsible 90 percent primary malignant liver tumor observe adult disproportionately affect men , three time many men develop disease woman . Common symptoms patient affected HCC include abdominal pain , weight loss , weakness , fullness anorexia , abdominal swelling , jaundice vomit . Multiple clinical stag system hepatic tumor use American Joint Committee Cancer TNM system ( stage 0 , A , B , C , D ) etc . However , stag system still evolve attempt improve classification prognosis prediction HCC , agreement best staging recommend world-wide . For advanced HCC , sorafenib likely become new standard care . Combinational therapy sorafenib potential improve therapeutic option patient suffer advanced HCC . Gemcitabine classical chemotherapeutic substance modest anti-cancer activity HCC . However , anti-cancer activity seem improve combined anti-cancer drug include drug interfere VEGF pathway . Both substance , sorafenib gemcitabine , favorable safety profile minimal overlap side effect . Further mode action sorafenib gemcitabine likely result synergistic anti-tumor effect . An open label , single arm , multicenter phase II study design determine progression free survival patient advanced stage HCC treat sorafenib combination gemcitabine . Patients receive 6 cycle gemcitabine ( IV 1000 mg/m2 day 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle ) combination sorafenib ( 400 mg po bid daily ) follow sorafenib ( 400 mg po bid daily ) maintenance disease progression .</detailed_description>
