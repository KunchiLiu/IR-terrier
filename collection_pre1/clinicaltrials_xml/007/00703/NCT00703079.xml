	<brief_summary>To investigate 60 month impact surgery somatostatin analogue ( SSA ) glucose metabolism acromegaly analyze data 100 patient acromegaly accord different treatment ( group A=with SSA ; group B= SSA follow surgery ; group C= surgery ; group D= surgery follow SSA ) . At diagnosis 6-12 60 month analyze primary outcome measure change fast glucose secondary outcome measure change glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) insulin level , HOMA-R HOMA-β , represent insulin resistance β-cell function , respectively . We enrol 100 patient expect half IGT diabetes mellitus . We expect change accord different treatment 60 month SSA-treated patient might experience deterioration glucose tolerance 6-12 month . We intend look predictor deterioration glucose tolerance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Somatostatin Analogs v . Surgery Glucose Metabolism Acromegaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) overt diabetes mellitus frequently associate acromegaly . Patients acromegaly insulin resistant liver periphery , display hyperinsulinemia increase glucose turn-over basal post-absorptive state . The prevalence diabetes mellitus IGT acromegaly unknown report range 19-56 % 16-46 % different series . The increased cardiovascular morbidity mortality associate acromegaly may party consequence increase insulin resistance frequently accompany GH excess . Glucose tolerance may worsen patient treated somatostatin analogue ( SSA ) , insulin secretion , i.e . β-cell function , also suppress . SSA induce control GH IGF-I excess approximately 60 % patient 12 month treatment significant difference apply unsuccessful surgery first-line newly diagnose patient control GH IGF-I level occur even high prevalence longer period treatment . The inhibitory effect SSA pancreatic insulin secretion might , however , complicate overall effect treatment glucose tolerance . We recently demonstrate 12 month first-line treatment SSA surgery produce similar improvement LV hypertrophy diastolic fill systolic function increase evidently SSA-treated patient , total/HDL-cholesterol ratio significantly reduce SSA-treated patient fast glucose level significantly reduce surgery-treated patient . A normal pituitary function find 46.4 % SSA-treated 36.4 % surgery-treated patient , result unchanged former slightly reduce latter . Both direct effect SSA preserve pituitary function might explain result . Longitudinal data glucose tolerance patient acromegaly without diabetes treat long-term SSA surgery still limit . In order investigate whether SSA negatively impact glucose tolerance acromegaly , analyze data collect prospectively 10 year period . We compare result glucose tolerance diagnosis 6-12 month 60 month treatment SSA surgery . Patients group accord treatment ( SSA , surgery , SSA follow surgery SSA follow surgery SSA ) order establish effect glucose tolerance mediate disease control type treatment .</detailed_description>
