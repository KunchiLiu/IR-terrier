	<brief_summary>The aim study determine effect balance training intervention change hyper-reactivity unloading reaction , ankle joint laxity , ankle joint proprioception evertor muscle weakness individual functional ankle instability ( FAI ) use quantitative biomechanical neuromuscular measurement . We hypothesize experimental FAI group demonstrate significant decline unload reaction follow balance train FAI control group show significant decline unload reaction without train . We hypothesize experimental FAI group demonstrate significant improvement FAI score balance training measure Ankle Instability questionnaire . Following balance training , significant correlation change FAI score change unload reaction experimental group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Balance Training Unloading Reaction Individuals With Functional Ankle Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conflicting result report regard effect ankle sprain proprioceptive sensation ankle , peroneal muscle strength ankle joint laxity past research study relate FAI . In spite controversy regard etiological factor FAI , balance training widely use sport medicine clinic treat FAI . Most study focus identification postural control deficits patient FAI rather try understand mechanism balance train etiological factor FAI . Hyper-reactivity ankle joint FAI may important factor ankle `` give way '' episode . Patients may develop injury-induced hyper-reactivity unload reaction adaptation physical condition ankle joint injury . Clinical study perform selective nerve block along electrophysiology study perform animal lead generally accept conclusion enhance pain induced peripheral nerve injury associate increase spontaneous evoked discharge injure and/or adjacent uninjured nerve . Persistent primary afferent input believe cause state central ( i.e . `` spinal '' ) sensitization enhance response sensory input i.e . hyper-reactivity . The ankle `` give way '' complex phenomenon mechanical neuromuscular factor combination mechanical neuromuscular factor may fault include ankle hyper-reactivity , joint laxity , proprioceptive deficit , muscle weakness . The purpose study examine effect balance training intervention various etiological factor FAI develop objective measurement physiological feature relate FAI . The study help u understand mechanism balance training FAI help u determine scope limitation balance training FAI subject clinical setting evaluate treatment efficacy .</detailed_description>
