	<brief_summary>The purpose CSF repository collect sample spinal fluid control patient neurologic disorder include exclusively ALS , Dementia , CRPS , neuropathy , neuromuscular disease . This CSF repository allow use CSF biochemical study various neurologic disease . It would also provide supply necessary normal disease control patient . CSF would obtain patient undergoing spinal tap reason include diagnosis , treatment , participation clinical trial . We propose collect additional &lt; 3 ml CSF lumbar puncture already perform diagnostic therapeutic reason , order store laboratory use future research study . No lumbar puncture initiate specifically protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebrospinal Fluid Repository</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific procedure unique protocol collection additional 3ml less cerebrospinal fluid lumbar puncture already perform collection clinical information patient medical record . Lumbar puncture may either research procedure standard care procedure , depend upon reason initiating puncture . We aliquot additional fluid separate storage container maintain laboratory Dr. Heiman-Patterson -70 degree . Clinical information include age , medical neurological history , laboratory data , pathologic information indicate abstracted patient chart . All specimen correspond clinical information label identification number sort diagnosis . There patient identifying information keep specimen . The CSF sample may use study perform researcher Drexel University College Medicine share collaborator . The CSF sample provide used project approval IRB , subject notified time use study . If CSF sample still available , consent withdrawn time write letter Dr. Heiman-Patterson request withdrawal sample . Researchers request control disease specific sample use various research study . There DNA study .</detailed_description>
