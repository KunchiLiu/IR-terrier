	<brief_summary>This study propose examine effect TMG therapy upon cellular element within central ( bone marrow ) peripheral ( lymph node ) lymphoid compartment human . Briefly , bone marrow aspirate lymph node obtain time transplant , renal transplant recipient receive TMG induction therapy . For comparative purpose , peripheral blood sample also obtain . Lymphocytes compartment assessed CD antigen expression , apoptosis , cytokine production follow memory immune response , functional assay assess potential regulatory T-cell ( Treg ) activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thymoglobulin : Presence Affect Central Lymphatic Compartment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin use increase frequency induce immunosuppression organ transplant recipient . Induction therapy use majority person receive kidney transplant . In 2004 , 72 % patient receive kidney transplant also receive induction therapy . This number 46 % reported 1995 . Anti-Thymocyte Globulin commonly use agent induction therapy . It use 37 % kidney recipient 2004 , use appear increase year year . A prominent example class drug Thymoglobulin ( TMG ) , purify , pasteurize gamma immune globulin , obtain immunization rabbit human thymocytes . The result preparation contain polyclonal antibody direct multiple T-cell marker , include CD antigen , HLA , home receptor . Although mechanism action immunosuppressive effect TMG fully elucidate , evidence complement-dependent cell lysis depletion , cell-surface antigen modulation , block adhesion molecule , partial T-cell activation/anergy may play potential role . Many effect TMG evident peripheral blood compartment , include rapid decline circulate T-cells . Non-human primate study demonstrate TMG treatment lead depletion T-cells via apoptosis peripheral lymphoid tissue ( spleen lymph node ) , study conduct assess effect TMG bone marrow , study examine peripheral lymphoid tissue human receive TMG therapy .</detailed_description>
