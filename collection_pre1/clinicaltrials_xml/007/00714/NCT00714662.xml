	<brief_title>High Flux Hemodialysis Thrice Versus Once</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct HD center NTUH . Patients undergo chronic HD least 6 month evaluate eligibility . Patients previous adverse reaction FX series dialyzer include study . Detailed demographic physical characteristic participant record , include age , gender , underlie disease , blood pressure , intradialytic complication , well indices nutrition , inflammation , dialysis adequacy . Eligible patient first undergo 4-week run-in HD conventional-flux dialyzer twice weekly plus high-flux dialyzer weekly ( i.e. , basic formula ) , follow random allocation two separate group . Patients group A continue HD basic formula , group B receive HD use high-flux membrane thrice weekly . Three month later , participant put back HD basic formula 1 month ( wash-out period ) . Group A patient switch receive HD high-flux membrane thrice weekly , group B patient change undergo HD basic formula another 3 month . Laboratory test include monthly biochemistry hemogram , plus blood urine specimens take 4 occasion study ( baseline , end first 3 month , end wash-out , end second 3 month ) investigate selective marker index nutrition , inflammation , dialysis adequacy .</detailed_description>
