	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Prolonged Release OROS Methylphenidate Adults With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate efficacy 2 fix dosage Prolonged Release ( PR ) OROS methylphenidate ( 54 72 mg/day ) compare placebo adult patient attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . The primary efficacy criterion change sum inattention hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale score investigator-rated Conners ' Adult ADHD Rating Scale ( CAARS ) , start treatment end double-blind treatment . Hypothesis primary objective state either PR OROS methylphenidate dose effective placebo 13 week treatment adult patient ADHD . This multicentre , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel group , dose-response study . Patients randomize one 3 treatment group receive oral dosage PR OROS methylphenidate 54 72 mg , placebo daily . The study include treatment period 13 week . Patients titrate start dose 36 mg/day 7 day , 54 72 mg/day Day 8 , treatment administer 12 week . The study include screen period 2 week , current therapy , allow study taper discontinue ( exception fluoxetine MAO ( monoamine oxidase ) inhibitor maximum screening period 4 week allow ) . A post-study visit collection additional efficacy safety data schedule one week patient 's final dose study drug . Adults diagnosis ADHD accord DSM-IV criterion symptom age 7 year continue meet criteria time assessment enrol study . ADHD diagnose symptom well account another psychiatric disorder ( e.g . mood disorder , anxiety disorder , psychotic disorder , personality disorder ) . The patient ( possible , informant ) must also describe chronic course ADHD symptomatology childhood adulthood . The description chronic course patient-based previous document diagnosis and/or treatment require . Approximately 300 patient ( 100 randomize treatment group ) participate study . The primary efficacy criterion change sum inattention hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale score investigator-rated CAARS baseline end treatment ( end 13 week last post-baseline assessment ) . This variable compare dosage group placebo use ANCOVA model . Other end point include change baseline end treatment CAARS subscales assessment clinical global impression - global change subscale ( CGI-C ) . Onset therapeutic effect responder rate also determine . In addition , morning / evening ( 8 pm ) CAARS-S : S assessment perform baseline Days 34 , 35 , 90 91 . Safety evaluation include monitor adverse event ( AEs ) , clinical laboratory test ( hematology ; biochemistry ) , pregnancy testing , vital sign ( supine stand blood pressure , pulse ) weight , ECG . Patients randomize receive PR OROS methylphenidate 54 72 mg , placebo daily . Study drug administer daily morning 13 week . Since food effect methylphenidate , drug administration feed fasted condition . Patients start dosage 36 mg. At Week 2 , patient receive 54 72 mg PR OROS methylphenidate 12 week .</detailed_description>
