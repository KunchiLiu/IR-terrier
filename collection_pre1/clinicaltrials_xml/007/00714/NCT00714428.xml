	<brief_summary>Objectives : The ultimate goal research program promote seamless , comprehensive care Operation Enduring Freedom/ Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OEF/OIF ) veteran . The purpose study develop psychometrically sound tool measure health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) applicable wound warrior TBI ( deployment-related TBI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Quality Life Tool TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific short-term objective study include : O1 : Identify parsimonious set domain capture HRQOL deployment-related TBI . O2 : Construct refine clinically-relevant HRQOL life item bank deployment-related TBI , order supplement TBI-QOL generic Neuro-QOL bank extend TBI/Neuro-QOL project address unique issue face wound warrior TBI . O3 : Utilize Item Response Theory methodology refine calibrate target generic item bank use deployment-related TBI . O4 : Develop short form , refine item set develop algorithms future development computerize adaptive test . Research Design : The propose three-year prospective study employ mixed method research design three stage . Combining qualitative quantitative method maximize ability study team design validate clinically sensitive HRQOL measure wound warrior deployment-related TBI . Furthermore , approach consistent FDA 's draft guidance patient report outcome ( PRO ) measure development . Phase 1 : Qualitative data obtain focus group veteran VA provider use ( ) evaluate generic Neuro-QOL domain item relevance appropriateness use deployment-related TBI ( b ) identify new HRQOL domains item specific deployment-related TBI . [ Objective # 1 ] Phase 2 : The generic specific item bank field test large sample veteran deployment-related TBI recruit 4 VA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers ( PRCs ) . [ Objective # 2 ] Phase 3 : Psychometric analysis , include item response theory ( IRT ) field test data complete . The psychometric property scale evaluate empirically . A short form develop , refine item set develop algorithms future development computerize adaptive test ( CAT ) . [ Objectives # 3 &amp; 4 ]</detailed_description>
