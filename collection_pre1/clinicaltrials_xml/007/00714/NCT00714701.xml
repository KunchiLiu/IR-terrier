	<brief_title>Screening Early Pancreatic Neoplasia ( Cancer Pancreas Screening CAPS4 Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer deadly disease hope improvement survival early detection . Certain genetic syndrome associate high risk pancreatic cancer screen pancreatic cancer become relatively new strategy familial pancreatic cancer . . Our pancreatic cancer research group Johns Hopkins others show screen EUS and/or abdominal imaging test CT/MRI detect relatively high number significant pancreatic neoplasm ( 7-18 % ) asymptomatic high risk individual inherit predisposition pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma This clinical , early detection translational study directly influence patient care . This long term study follow successful completion single center Cancer Pancreas ( CAPS ) 1 CAPS 2 study Johns Hopkins , ongoing CAPS 3 multicenter study . GENERAL AIM : This study aim evaluate diagnostic yield , quality life , clinical outcome clinical screen surveillance program individual at-risk pancreatic cancer validate candidate panel biomarkers early detection pancreatic neoplasia . The 3 specific group screen followed individual familial pancreatic cancer kindred ( 2 affect relative estimate risk 16-57 time control ) , patient familial Peutz-Jeghers syndrome , patient know BRCA-2 , BRCA-1 , PALB2 , PRSS p16 germline mutation .</detailed_description>
