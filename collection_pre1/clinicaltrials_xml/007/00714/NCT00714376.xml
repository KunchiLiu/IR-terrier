	<brief_title>Phase II Study Docetaxel Clinically Asymptomatic High Risk Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients high-risk prostate cancer high probability PSA failure radical prostatectomy . However , half patient remain free PSA recurrence 10 year . To contrary , patient early PSA recurrence double time le 10 month mortality rate approach 50 % 10 year despite hormone therapy . Although androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) remain standard treatment patient early rapidly rise PSA prostatectomy , treatment curative long term patient . The recent demonstration activity Taxotere ( docetaxel ) high proportion patient advance metastatic disease stimulate great interest use earlier stage disease . Recent study perform animal model prostate cancer suggest response rate prostate cancer cell docetaxel-induced cell death significantly enhance androgen stimulation AR-positive , androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell ( i.e . ADT ) . Therefore , protocol proposes assess response rate primary Taxotere chemotherapy patient early rapid PSA rise prostatectomy high risk disease .</detailed_description>
