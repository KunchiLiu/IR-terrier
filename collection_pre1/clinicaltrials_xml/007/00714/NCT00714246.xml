	<brief_summary>This phase I/II study . The phase I portion study determine maximum tolerate dose bortezomib administer combination carboplatin &amp; docetaxel determine efficacy combination patient advance NSCLC . Phase II determine time progression overall survival determine change serum proteomics pattern &amp; combination therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib ( PS-341 ) Combination With Carboplatin Docetaxel Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A chemotherapy efficacy plateau ' reach treatment patient advance metastatic non-small cell lung cancer . Platinum-based two-drug combination consider current standard care treatment advance NSCLC . There need develop novel regimen improve outcome patient advance NSCLC . The combination carboplatin docetaxel effective therapy advance NSCLC . This combination result improve survival quality life patient advance NSCLC . Docetaxel exhibit preclinical synergy bortezomib . Hence plan perform phase I/II study define maximum tolerate dose bortezomib administer combination docetaxel carboplatin subsequently evaluate efficacy regimen patient advance NSCLC .</detailed_description>
