	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , hydroxychloroquine temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose hydroxychloroquine give together temozolomide treat patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxychloroquine Temozolomide Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) administer combination temozolomide ( TMZ ) patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor . Secondary - To determine toxicity toxicity rate HCQ administer MTD combination TMZ patient . Tertiary - To construct population pharmacokinetic ( PK ) model use limited sample whole blood determine drug exposure HCQ HCQ metabolites patient . - To measure change autophagic vesicle accumulation immunoblotting autophagy marker LC3 protein lysates prepared peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) collect patient treat HCQ TMZ . - To measure change median number autophagic vesicle electron microscopy PBMC collect patient treat HCQ TMZ . - To assess tumor change LC3 caspase 3 cleavage western blotting . - To assess tumor cell death characteristic immunohistochemical method ( Ki67 , TUNEL staining , cleave caspase 3 ) . - To evaluate autophagy electron microscopy . - To define association change LC3 level baseline PBMC HCQ exposure . - To measure level HMGB1 serum patient treat HCQ TMZ . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) . Patients receive oral HCQ alone twice daily 14 day . Patients receive oral HCQ twice daily day 1-28 oral temozolomide daily day 1-7 15-21 . Treatment HCQ temozolomide repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic correlative study . Autophagic vesicles blood sample quantify immunoblotting autophagy protein LC3 electron microscopy . Pharmacokinetics analyze high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry . Patients tumor amenable biopsy also undergo serial biopsy . Tumor tissue sample assess tumor cell apoptosis proliferation use Ki67 TUNEL stain number autophagic vesicle nuclear change characteristic apoptotic , autophagic , necrotic cell death western blot electron microscopy . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
