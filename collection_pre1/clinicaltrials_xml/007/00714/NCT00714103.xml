	<brief_title>8-Chloro-Adenosine Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>8-Chloro-adenosine new drug similar drug already approve FDA treatment CLL type cancer . 8-Chloro-adenosine belongs class chemotherapy drug call purine analogue work treat cancer ability interfere cancer cell metabolism , cause cell death . If eligible , receive 8-chloro-adenosine infusion vein day five day row . Each infusion take 1 hour . This 5-day treatment repeat every 4 week ( ± 3 day ) ( 1 course ) . This dose escalation study . Patients treat study treat group 3 . The first group receive low dose drug . If type , number , severity side effect experience acceptable , next group 3 patient receive next high dose drug . The dose drug increase new group high safe dose find . For first course , blood test ( 1 tablespoon ) Day 3 Day 5 treatment monitor safety . After , weekly ( ± 3 day ) evaluation routine blood test ( 1 tablespoon ) clinic University Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ( UTMDACC ) . During evaluation , also physical exam ask side effect may experience . You evaluate improvement CLL . If disease stable respond treatment , may continue treatment . If disease improves point doctor feel complete remission , request bone marrow biopsy confirm complete remission . If disease worsen appear treatment help , stop treatment 8-chloro-adenosine may begin treatment direction treat doctor . If unacceptable side effect , may take treatment . If stop treatment , evaluate clinic routine blood test ( 1 tablespoon ) week first month , twice month next 2 month , month . During evaluation , physical exam ask side effect may experience . If begin treatment , schedule follow-up end . This investigational study . 8-Chloro-adenosine approved FDA commercially available . A total 28 patient take part study . All enrol treat MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
