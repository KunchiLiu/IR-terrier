	<detailed_description>MPX111381 multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , flexible-dose evaluation GSK1838262 1200 mg/day , 1800 mg/day , 2400 mg/day 3000 mg/day compare placebo prophylactic treatment migraine headache . Subjects 18 year age must experience least three migraine headache attack ( without aura accord 2004 International Headache Society [ IHS ] criteria 1.1 1.2.1 ) per month 3 month prior screen least four migraine headache day less 15 total headache day ( migraine non-migraine ) per month 3 month prior screen must maintain requirement throughout last 4 week baseline period . Approximately 528 subject approximately 53 center North America randomize 2:1:2:2:1 ratio follow treatment group : placebo , GSK1838262 1200 mg/day , 1800 mg/day , 2400 mg/day 3000 mg/day . Investigational product administer twice daily ( morning evening ) food ( e.g. , meal snack ) . The study consist six study period total study duration 30 week : Screening ( 2 week ) , baseline ( include randomization , 6 week ) , flexible titration ( 5 week ) , maintenance ( 12 week ) , taper ( 3 week ) post-treatment ( 2 week ) . The flexible titration administration investigational product design allow subject reach target dose maintenance treatment , unable reach target dose , achieve maximum tolerate dose maintenance treatment . Subjects opportunity undergo single dose ( 600 mg/day ) downward adjustment flexible titration period intolerability current dose occurs . Subsequently , single dose downward adjustment occur , dose adjustment study ( upward downward ) permit .</detailed_description>
