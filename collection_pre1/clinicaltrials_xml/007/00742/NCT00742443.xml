	<brief_title>Juvista Scar Revision Surgery Disfiguring Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year , one hundred million people undergo elective emergency surgery leave scar . Of , half million patient undergo scar revision surgery . These type scar usually disfigure , aesthetically unpleasant cause complication severe itching , tenderness , pain , depression disruption daily activity lead diminish quality life . There clinical need treatment reduce scar , current therapy often ineffective inadequate . Results previous clinical trial show Juvista effective improving scar young elderly male female . Juvista-treated wound appear heal scar similar surround skin , narrow paler faster fade redness compare placebo standard care alone . This study confirm effectiveness Juvista ( avotermin ) improvement scar appearance apply wound margin patient follow scar revision surgery disfigure scar . The study double blind , within patient , placebo control , randomise trial male female patient . Patients ask attend 10 study visit follow post-surgery 12 month . The potential benefit patient take part trial scar revise plastic surgeon . This procedure leave subject less noticeable scar . The exist scar surgically remove result wound divide two segment equal length . In patient , one segment receive treatment Juvista administer intradermal injection , placebo .
