	<brief_title>A European Study Medical Management Versus TAG Device + Medical Management Acute Uncomplicated Type B Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dissection aorta medical emergency require immediate surgery . Type B dissection typically treat surgery endoluminal therapy complication uncontrollable pain , organ ischemia , aortic rupture present . However , treatment patient uncomplicated , acute type B dissection controversial . Best medical therapy ( BMT ) standard care case since surgical repair offer additional survival advantage . However , Endoluminal stent graft therapy GORE TAG Thoracic Endoprosthesis ( GORE TAG device ) may offer distinct advantage adjunct medical therapy uncomplicated acute type B dissection . The goal endoluminal stent graft cover primary entry tear dissection isolate false lumen blood flow induce aortic remodeling .</detailed_description>
