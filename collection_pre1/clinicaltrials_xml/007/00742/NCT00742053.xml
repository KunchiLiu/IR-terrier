	<brief_title>Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Guided Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter ( PICC ) Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PICC line placement common procedure , make difficult need ensure catheter tip placement acceptable location , typically superior vena cava ( SVC ) , ideally junction SVC right atrium . Tip location determine present chest X-ray , performed procedure . If tip location incorrect , additional procedure and/or X-rays need proper placement ensure . Use electrode place inside catheter insertion report provide identifiable change p-wave sufficient guide placement . This study design collect ECG catheter depth information routine PICC placement procedure , correlate ECG change tip location determine contrast enhance fluoroscopy .</detailed_description>
