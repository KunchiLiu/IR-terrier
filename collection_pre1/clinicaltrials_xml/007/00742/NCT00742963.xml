	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Study TH-302 Combination With Doxorubicin Treat Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A broad range tumor show contain significant number hypoxic cell hypoxia show associated poor prognosis increase resistance chemotherapy radiotherapy ( Brizel 1997 , Vaupel 2007 , Shannon 2003 ) . It likely agent could effectively target hypoxic region tumor would improve efficacy combine standard chemotherapy radiotherapy . TH-302 activate low oxygen concentration bioreductive prodrugs ( Duan 2008 ) tirapazamine , hypoxic cytotoxin extensively study preclinical clinical study . This result improve therapeutic ratio ( tumor v normal tissue toxicity ) compare bioreductive agent . Because TH-302 expect minimally toxic aerobic cancer cell , optimal efficacy would expect TH-302 combined treatment effective aerobic condition radiotherapy cytotoxic chemotherapy . Preclinical data show least additive efficacy TH-302 combine chemotherapy . In order minimize risk additive toxicity , TH-302 evaluate combination alkylating agent . The study enroll subject advance soft tissue sarcoma . These tumor evidence support presence hypoxia base pO2 histography , F-MISO gene expression profile ( Vaupel 2007 , Francis 2007 , Rajendran 2003 ) .</detailed_description>
