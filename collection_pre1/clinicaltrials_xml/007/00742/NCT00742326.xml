	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness pioglitazone reduce liver fat content patient HIV hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . Fatty liver accompany insulin resistance patient HIV HCV co-infections associate inflammatory change , liver fibrosis poorer response HCV treatment . Pioglitazone drug help reduce body 's resistance insulin . It approve Food Drug Administration treat diabetes . Patients HIV HCV co-infections hepatic steatosis ( fatty liver ) may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) liver measure liver fat , need , liver biopsy confirm diagnosis liver steatosis . - Participants randomly assign take either pioglitazone therapy placebo 48 week . This follow second 48-week treatment period participant take pioglitazone . - There approximately 12 visit 96 week study . Participants receive physical assessment , blood urine test visit . In addition , periodic assessment dietary habit , body composition , oral glucose tolerance test , health relate quality life questionnaire complete . - A repeat MRI liver perform 48 week end study evaluate potential change liver fat inflammation . In addition , follow-up liver biopsy 48 week optional liver biopsy 96 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Treat Fatty Liver Patients With HIV Hepatitis C Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following introduction effective antiretroviral therapy HIV , management co-morbidities hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) take increase significance care health maintenance chronically infected patient . HCV co-infection common HIV , estimate prevalence 30 percent among HIV-infected adult US . Further , report prevalence hepatic steatosis HIV/HCV co-infection 40-67 percent . In recent year , significance hepatic steatosis accompany insulin resistance HCV gain increase recognition . For example , steatosis associate increased rate necro-inflammatory change fibrosis HIV/HCV co-infected patient . Furthermore , study show , among non-HIV infected HCV patient , presence steatosis and/or insulin resistance associate poor response HCV therapy . These observation lead research interest treat hepatic steatosis HCV , particularly context pegylated interferon ribavirin therapy . Administration thiazolidinedione , pioglitazone , lead significant reduction hepatic steatosis , inflammation case fibrosis patient non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . Therefore , potential benefit pioglitazone therapy set HIV/HCV co-infection hepatic steatosis determine . The propose study 48-week , double-blind , randomized placebo-controlled trial pioglitazone ( 45 mg/day ) 50 HIV/HCV-infected men woman . After 48-week randomized portion trial , participant enter 48-week open treatment extension arm irrespective original randomization . It anticipate 100 subject need screen identify sufficient number eligible participant enroll study . The primary outcome variable interest trial change hepatic fat content measure magnetic resonance ( MR ) spectroscopy . Important secondary outcome histologic improvement liver biopsy perform baseline 48 week , well improvement transaminase level insulin resistance . The open treatment extension allow participant opportunity receive active study medication allow potential benefit additional pioglitazone therapy assess . In way , important information efficacy pioglitazone treat hepatic steatosis improve metabolic profile HIV/HCV co-infected patient obtain .</detailed_description>
