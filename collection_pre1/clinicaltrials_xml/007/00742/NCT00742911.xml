	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES : Primary Objectives â€¢ Determine safety toxicity profile co-administration disulfiram copper gluconate treatment refractory malignancy metastasize liver . Secondary Objectives - Determine disulfiram copper gluconate induce measurable response treatment hepatic metastasis solid tumor . - Qualitative assessment induction S-glutathionylation proteins circulate leukocyte patient treat disulfiram copper gluconate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Disulfiram Copper Gluconate Treatment Refractory Solid Tumors Involving Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We perform experimental study demonstrate anti-cancer efficacy old alcoholism treatment drug , disulfiram , combine supplementation certain metal ion . Together , disulfiram metal ion induce S-glutathionylation critical cancer cell protein , inhibit activity , reduce tumor growth induce tumor cell apoptosis . The active metal ion pair disulfiram appear divalent metal ion copper . The purpose study determine safety co-administrating thiocarbamate molecule disulfiram together copper gluconate patient stage IV cancer metastatic liver . Other investigator study effect disulfiram alone administer patient metastatic melanoma , observe clinical benefit disulfiram administer without metal ion supplement ( Dr. Patrick J . Farmer , University California Irvine , personal communication ) . We therefore propose optimum approach use disulfiram antineoplastic agent co-administer metal ion supplement . While number metal ion enhance antineoplastic activity disulfiram , include Zn2+ , find Cu2+ active . This observation confirm others , show Cu2+ supplementation growth medium increase pro-apoptotic ( Cen 2004 ) proteosomal-inhibitory ( Chen 2006 ) activity disulfiram . Compared surround normal tissue , many cancer cell contain highly elevate level copper ( Habib 1980 ; Rizk 1984 ; Turecky 1984 ; Diez 1989 ; Huang 1999 ; Kuo 2002 ; Nayak 2003 ) . However , typical Western diet provide 1 mg copper daily , less even low limit 1.5 3.0 mg estimate safe adequate daily dietary intake ( ESADDI ) copper ( Kelvay 1998 ; Failla 1999 ; Ma 2000 ; Pang 2001 ; Davis 2003 ) . Therefore , dietary copper supplementation likely necessary disulfiram maximally effective antineoplastic drug . We project optimal dose copper supplementation pair disulfiram 8 mg elemental copper day , upper level recommend daily copper ( Institute Medicine 2002 ) , administer copper gluconate , substance generally regard safe ( GRAS ) ( Code Federal Regulation 2004 ) . This amount would provide eight-fold high intake copper American adult consume daily . Large amount ingest copper could result hepatic failure hemolysis similar see Wilson 's disease , rare genetic syndrome hyperabsorption copper . However , 8 mg elemental copper previously administer human untoward effect ( Pratt 1985 ; Olivares 1996 ; Rosado 2003 ; Mendez 2004 ; Araya 2005 ) , one study even 20 mg daily copper supplementation well-tolerated ( Araya 2004 ) . Although copper intake homeostatically regulate , reduce gastrointestinal absorption high intake ( Turnland 2005 ) , chronic ingestion much 60 mg elemental copper daily likely toxic normal individual ( O'Donohue 1993 ) . In combine copper gluconate disulfiram antineoplastic strategy , would propose administer two fashion similar use treatment patient metastatic ocular melanoma , experience diarrhea zinc gluconate disulfiram give different time day ( Figure 6.10 ) . Copper gluconate contain 8 mg elemental copper would give morning half hour breakfast , disulfiram would consume even meal . The rationale separate administration two agent time avoid produce gastrointestinal toxicity mucositis complexation copper disulfiram gut . Administered separately , believe disulfiram Cu2+ complex vivo , form bi ( diethyldi-thiocarbamato ) -copper ( II ) complex ( Johansson 1992 ) provide enhance antineoplastic activity . It also possible metabolite disulfiram important activity ( Loo 2004 ) might also enhance supplementation copper . Administered orally , disulfiram Cu2+ likely achieve high hepatic concentration distribution body tissue . This might suggest utility disulfiram Cu2+ treat primary hepatic tumor hepatomas , secondary hepatic metastasis common malignancy colonic adenocarcinoma . The possibility selective hepatic antineoplastic activity support experience patient suffer metastatic ocular melanoma ( Figure 6.10 ) . Subjects study include advanced cancer metastatic liver currently receive eligible therapeutic approach . When prescribe clinically alcohol aversion , disulfiram indicate dos range 125 mg 500 mg orally day . For safety reason , initiate disulfiram use fix dose 250 mg per day , give even meal . We begin dose copper gluconate ( 2 mg elemental copper ) give daily morning breakfast meal . These dose time choose separate time administration copper gluconate disulfiram within gastrointestinal lumen simultaneously , thereby prevent development diarrhea side effect mucositis intraluminal formation metal-thiocarbamate complex . Copper gluconate dos increase cohort 3 6 patient detailed long dose limit toxicity observe . The maximum dose copper gluconate administer equivalent 8 mg elemental copper reason outline . Subjects maintain regimen follow duration protocol long show toxicity disease progression , periodic measurement end-points outline later . Major emphasis place follow ALT AST index safety serial abdominal imaging determine anatomic burden hepatic metastasis . During protocol four week thereafter , subject warn ingestion ethanol exposure alcohol-containing medication consumer product . We propose gradually escalate dose scheme anticipation likely toxicity combine ingestion disulfiram copper supplement : hepatotoxicity . After gastrointestinal absorption , agent likely concentrate first liver . Therefore , great risk likely increase hepatic transaminase . From experience combine administration disulfiram zinc supplement patient ( Brar 2004 ) believe separate time copper gluconate ( morning breakfast meal ) disulfiram ( even meal ) ingest prevent bothersome diarrhea symptom mucositis result metal-thiocarbamate complexation within bowel lumen . We anticipate careful warn ingestion ethanol-containing beverage exposure alcohol-containing consumer product avert risk inadvertent disulfiram ethanol reaction .</detailed_description>
