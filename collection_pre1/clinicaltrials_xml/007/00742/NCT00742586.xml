	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify 15 patient autonomic failure obtain blood sample RNA participant 15 control subject within age range . The stabilized blood sample , along limited data set , ship Western Michigan University actual laboratory analysis ( separate study ) sample take place . Unique genetic inscription , call gene expression signature , currently identify many disease , include neurological disease . The secondary goal study support research do WMU try look MSA-specific sign present whole blood sample MSA patient late-stages disease . This pilot study long term goal ( additional study ) MSA-specific gene expression signature development diagnostic test disease use future . Other patient group autonomic failure , characterize significant drop blood pressure standing , also include study , look similar genetic inscription . This pilot study expect last 2 year . The investigator WMU need de-identified health Information subject , include age diagnosis , age ( sample drawn ) list medication</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients one follow autonomic problem recruit participate study : multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) , pure autonomic failure ( PAF ) Parkinson 's Plus . The study consist draw 15 ml whole blood RNA . The blood drawn special collection tube stabilize RNA material blood . The sample freeze ship WMU analysis . The patient also ask provide current list medication , age age first diagnose neurologic autonomic disorder . This information de-identified sent investigator WMU limit data set .</detailed_description>
