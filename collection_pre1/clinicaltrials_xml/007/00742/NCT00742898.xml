	<brief_title>Evaluation Opt-Out Rapid HIV Testing Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimate 40,000 new HIV infection occur annually United States . Although significant effort devote improve identification patient undiagnosed HIV infection , rate change little last decade new infection appear increase non-traditional risk group , include racial ethnic minority . Most person infect HIV still get test late disease course , primarily due long asymptomatic period relatively poor access routine medical care . Over 100 million people visit emergency department ( EDs ) annually , ED commonly serve patient 's source medical care , thus potential opportunity receive HIV counseling , test , referral ( CTR ) . Also , patient likely use ED source care often HIV epidemic spreading . The primary objective propose research demonstrate clinical effectiveness , clinical efficiency , cost effectiveness , patient-staff satisfaction perform routine voluntary opt-out rapid HIV CTR high-volume urban ED , compare target rapid HIV CTR program setting . The primary hypothesis propose investigation opt-out rapid HIV CTR associate high rate overall testing , identification patient infected HIV , identification patient infect HIV earlier disease course , successful linkage medical preventative care patient test positive HIV infection . The secondary hypothesis opt-out rapid HIV CTR : ( 1 ) associate increase ED process care , define patient wait time , length stay , proportion patient leave complete evaluation , overcrowd index ; ( 2 ) cost-effective . The tertiary hypothesis opt-out rapid HIV CTR associate high level patient ED staff satisfaction . To address hypothesis , perform prospective quasi-experimental equivalent time-samples clinical trial consecutive patient present ED interventional period offer opt-out rapid HIV CTR part visit , control period , patient target physician rapid HIV CTR use previously develop validate CTR model . The result obtain study improve understand best identify patient HIV infection ED , whether opt-out rapid HIV CTR effective mean achieve CDC 's goal identify asymptomatic HIV-infected patient earlier disease course .</detailed_description>
