	<brief_summary>Genomic imprinting , refer epigenetic mark result monoallelic gene expression , play critical role development . Recently , various imprint disease report animal ( Large Offspring syndrome ( LOS ) ) human ( Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ( BWS ) Angelman syndrome ( AS ) ) bear ART . In case , imprint defect involve ( loss methylation ICR2 BWS , SNRPN AS IGF2R DMR2 LOS ) . These data suggest ART procedure may impair establishment maintenance ( follow fertilization ) methylation mark maternally imprint locus . In view data , aim study determine child bear follow ART exhibit increase risk imprinting defect . If answer yes , second objective identify problematic step ART procedure thus suppress modify step .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methodology : assessment methylation status 9 different imprint locus ( use Southern blot methyl-specific quantitative PCR ) 3 group patient : 150 child naturally conceive , 150 child conceive ovarian stimulation vivo fertilization , 150 child conceive ovarian stimulation VITRO fertilization . These analysis perform cord blood . Fragments placental tissue also collect analysis . Patients select maternity hospital associate ART department ( ANTOINE BECLERE HOSPITAL , Cochin HOSPITAL , Saint-Vincent de Paul HOSPITAL , Jean VERDIER HOSPITAL , Tenon HOSPITAL Dijon Hospital ) . This work also unique opportunity establish DNA , RNA tissue collection allow investigation regard epigenetic modification DNA methylation , imprint locus , also genomic region regulate epigenetic modification .</detailed_description>
