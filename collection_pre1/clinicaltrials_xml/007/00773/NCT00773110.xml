	<brief_title>Study Albumin Reduce Inflammation Following Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The host response infection form tissue injury term systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) . SIRS see association wide variety non-infective insult , include major trauma surgical procedure , include necessitate cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . In population incidence SIRS high , afflict 70 % patient . This may manifest increase vasopressor requirement , refractory hypotension , multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) liver , renal , myocardial , neurological problem . MODS associate significant mortality rate around 30-45 % . Survivors require prolong costly intensive care , thereby represent considerable burden healthcare service . Survivors often suffer considerable morbidity significantly impair health relate quality life . Despite intense investigation anti-inflammatory therapy SIRS sequela , case patient largely supportive whilst underlie trigger ( infection ) process treat . Indeed , therapy drotrecogin alfa ( activate ) demonstrate reduced mortality randomise study investigate patient severe SIRS consequent infection ( i.e . severe sepsis ) contra-indicated undergone surgery . Haemolysis common feature surgery require CPB may potentiate development SIRS organ injury release heme/iron . Furthermore , haemolysis CPB may lead depletion important mechanism scavenge free heme/hemoglobin circulation . Albumin , abundant plasma protein , specific non-specific heme iron binding site use circumstance standard scavenger overwhelm . However , albumin also deplete follow CPB . It therefore hypothesise prim CPB circuit albumin heme/iron scavenge capability plasma maintain follow surgery systemic inflammatory response attenuate .</detailed_description>
