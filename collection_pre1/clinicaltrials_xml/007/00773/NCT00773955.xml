	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid work treat patient recurrent extensive-stage small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>R- ( - ) -Gossypol Acetic Acid Treating Patients With Recurrent Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate R- ( - ) -gossypol patient recurrent chemotherapy-sensitive extensive stage small cell lung cancer . II . To determine time disease progression . III . To determine overall survival . IV . To assess toxicity associate drug . V. To explore whether intratumoral Bcl-2 family member expression correlate sensitivity target R- ( - ) -gossypol . VI . To explore whether administration R- ( - ) -gossypol cause specific induction intrinsic apoptotic pathway . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral R- ( - ) -gossypol daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood collect periodically treatment pharmacodynamic analysis . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell analyze via protein isolation western blot Bcl-2 , cytoplasmic release cytochrome c , caspase activation . Available tumor tissue block assess immunohistochemistry . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
