	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine improve treatment patient cervical dystonia help standard Botox injection . This study patient cervical dystonia benefit treatment Botox use conventional `` single lead electromyographic ( EMG ) technique '' injection . The study aim see patient may significantly benefit Botox injected muscle choose multi-channel EMG mapping study neck prior Botox injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The common type primary late-onset dystonia cervical dystonia . Botulinum toxin A ( BTX-A ) injection safe effective treatment cervical dystonia majority patient , however , significant minority patient ( 15 25 % ) suboptimal response Botulinum toxin therapy . It unclear patient respond maximally neurotoxin therapy . Studies use needle electromyographic `` mapping '' evaluation cervical dystonia reveal clinical examination alone insufficient determine muscle contribute dystonic movement . When compare needle electromyography ( EMG ) `` map study '' , experience movement disorder specialist correctly identify 59 % active muscle believe 25 % muscle upon EMG evaluation find quiescent , involve dystonia . The selection incorrect muscle injection Botulinum toxin may explain patient sub-optimal response . This study seek measure outcomes muscle involve dystonia identify use `` mapping '' via 8-12 channel EMG . In proposed study , involved/active dystonic muscle correctly identify simultaneous 8-12 channel mapping result informed injection strategy , may improve response Botulinum toxin A treatment compare single lead EMG base injection . This study change routine clinical care add step study muscle neck simultaneous EMG mapping allow objective injection strategy .</detailed_description>
