	<brief_summary>Background : Between 2000 2006 , 433 patient overexpose ( 8 % 10 % ) course conformal radiotherapy prostate adenocarcinoma Jean MONNET hospital , Epinal , France . Among , twenty four patient receive additional mean dose 20 % , due inappropriate use treatment planning system . Severe adverse event ( proctitis , cystitis , tissue necrosis ) occur among overexposed patient . We propose develop several research program order increase scientific knowledge iatrogenic effect related overexposure ionize radiation , study relationship dosimetric , clinical , biologic genetic characteristic . Aim study : To correlate received dos , volume irradiate normal tissue , event , biologic , phenotypic genetic data . Primary study endpoint : Incidence severity adverse event relate radiotherapy ( accord SOMA - LENT CTCAE scale ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patients Overexposed Prostate Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary study endpoint : - Correlation adverse event radiation dose biologic , phenotypic genetic data . - Evaluation T-lymphocyte apoptosis predict radiation-induced late toxicity - Gene association risk adverse event relate radiotherapy - Levels circulate microparticles bystander effect irradiation Inclusion criterion : Consecutive patient treated prostate adenocarcinoma radiation department Jean MONNET Hospital 2000 2006 . Potential . Better identification patient high risk adverse event related radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
