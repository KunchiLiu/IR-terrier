	<brief_summary>Nodal stag key-step pre-treatment assessment gynecological cancer . In recent year , lymphatic mapping sentinel lymphadenectomy ( LM/SL ) minimally invasive pelvic lymph node stag successfully evaluate woman early stage vulvar cancer , cervical cancer , endometrial cancer . Such technique may offer several valuable advantage : ) readily applicable clinical routine use safe , inexpensive , reproducible protocol ; b ) may help avoid cost morbidity unnecessary lymphadenectomy majority case uninvolved sentinel lymph node ; c ) potential guide surgeon nodal region routinely dissect ( i.e . pre-sacral , para-aortic node ) identify micro-metastases would ignore otherwise ; ) also offer basis sophisticated pathological analysis detect sub-microscopic nodal metastases use either immunohistochemical molecular biological technique . So far , within abdomen pelvis , LM/SL technique alone often blinded accurate localization SLNs . The integration compute tomography ( CT ) single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) device single gantry ( SPECT/CT ) allow significant gain term diagnostic accuracy anatomic precision ; clinical example include malignant melanoma , head neck cancer , breast cancer , bladder cancer . In seminal series 26 patient cervical cancer ( Zhang et al. , 2006 ) , SPECT/CT recently find superior conventional planar image detection SLN accurate localization . A recent study ( Kushner al. , 2007 ) also highlight technical feasibility clinical added-value low-dose SPECT/CT series 20 patient early stage cervical cancer ( IA2-IIA ) underwent LM/SL . In light encourage data literature preliminary clinical experience , hypothesize use LM/SL plus SPECT/CT may clinical interest patient gynecological cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This clinical trial aim assess utility minimally invasive surgery preoperatively guide new nuclear medicine imaging procedure call SPECT/CT . In patient suffer early stage gynecological cancer clinical evidence lymph node involvement , theoretically reason perform systematically aggressive lymphadenectomy demonstrate type lymphophilic cancer malignant melanoma , breast cancer , head neck cancer . We plan follow well know safe procedure Nuclear Medicine call lymphatic mapping sentinel lymphadenectomy ( LM/SL ) . The patient inject gynecologist referee department Nuclear Medicine . These injection consist radioactive tracer routinely use Nuclear Medicine , allow detection first nod drain primary tumor . The so-called sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) may different lymph node anatomically predefined . As well demonstrated cancer , include mention , hypothesize histological status SLN may accurately reflect histological status entire nodal basin . If assumption clinically validate , minimally invasive procedure may avoid cost morbidity unnecessary complete lymph node dissection majority patient uninvolved SLNs . The originality clinical trial also rely upon use new hybrid imaging device call SPECT/CT , allow ability obtain single study functional anatomical information . This critical precisely guide surgeon task . No contrast medium inject study . The radiation exposure remain within limit accept worldwide ; instance , CT dose index ( CTDI ) 3.0 mGy , order yearly natural background radiation exposure ( &lt; 2mSv ) . In clinical trial , patient treat accord standard care currently apply gynecological cancer . Therefore , either hysterectomy vulvectomy follow complete lymph node dissection ( CLND ) . Overall , research protocol carry 1-day protocol include SPECT/CT guide LM/SL CLND .</detailed_description>
