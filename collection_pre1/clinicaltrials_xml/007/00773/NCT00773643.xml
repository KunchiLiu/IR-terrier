	<brief_title>Osteogenic Profiling Tissue From Children With Craniosynostosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The screening procedure include review collection information patient 's medical record , Name , Date Birth , Medical record number , clinical diagnosis classification craniosynostosis , genetic screen syndromic synostosis ( FGFR , TWIST , MSX2 mutation screen ) , clinical examination Cleft -Craniofacial Center . During clinical examination , plastic surgeon determine presence craniosynostosis need surgical intervention . The evaluation surgical repair patient craniosynostosis differ normal , current standard care . In order reconstruct , reshape , expand contour deform craniofacial skeleton , large skin incision subcutaneous dissection necessary allow sufficient exposure procedure . These large incision dissection necessary part reconstruction . During normal course procedure , temporalis muscle , muscle mastication temporal area , subcutaneous adipose visible expose . It plastic surgeon obtain standard exposure excisional biopsy maximum size 2mm X 2mm X 3mm take consented patient . Bone sample collect bone tissue would normally discard reconstructive surgery , additional procedure need collect bone sample . Biopsy sample provide secondary investigator . The muscle adipose biopsy research require procedure . At time surgery one sample tissue take temporalis muscle , subcutaneous adipose , bone . The investigator review result test/procedure part standard care result become part research record . The investigator continue use disclose identifiable medical information keep store tissue sample seven year . After seven year period , identify information remove sample destroy . The muscle adipose tissue biopsy take approximately 10 minute . The sample bone tissue discard result reconstructive surgery , therefore , add time surgical procedure . Subjects notify result study result impact clinical care subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children craniosynostosis undergo surgical calvarial reconstruction age 2 month age 18 year old include study . This surgery standard care sequence treatment craniosynostosis patient . Pediatric plastic surgeon CleftCraniofacial Center Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh UPMC work primarily child part patient population train residency . Children evaluate initially Pittsburgh Cleft Palate Craniofacial Center Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh set accommodate child age family . Approximately twelve twenty child normally treat facility year . All patient ask contribute study . The research study satisfies risk Criterion 3 ( 45 CFR 46.406 ) inclusion child research whereas research involve intervention procedure present great minimal risk involve child hold potential direct individual benefit . Pediatric patient undergoing surgical repair craniosynostosis normally biopsy temporalis muscle adipose tissue scalp ( experimental procedure ) . These biopsy perform plastic surgeon experience surgical repair pediatric patient pose additional likely common risk surgical repair calvaria . Infrequent risk may include slight increase bleed represent drop blood loss . Rare risk , occur less one percent patient , may subject patient injury nerve small area biopsy may result decrease muscle function area . This intervention could provide detailed , basic information regard relationship progenitor cell craniosynostosis . All patient undergo calvarial reconstruction correct craniosynostosis exclude study . Selection base individual 's willingness participate study . A subject also remove research study target muscle , adipose , bone tissue unavailable due necrosis , infection , removal tissue may adversely effect surgical outcome way .</criteria>
