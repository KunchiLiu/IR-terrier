The study group give another validated questionnaire ( King 's Health Questionnaire3 , 5 KHQ ) analyze quality life give urge symptom prior randomization . This quantify use score system associate KHQ . The mentioned questionnaire write three common language population include English , Spanish , French . If translation necessary , language line use .
