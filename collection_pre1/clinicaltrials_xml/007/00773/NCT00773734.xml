	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Apremilast ( CC-10004 ) Subjects With Moderate-to-Severe Plaque-Type Psoriasis ( Core Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study fully explore extent treatment benefit achieve dos apremilast 30 mg mouth ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) treatment duration 6 month . In addition , important determine minimally effective dose apremilast fully elucidate dose response curve patient population . The result study help guide selection dose phase 3 trial . Participants meet eligibility criterion Baseline Visit ( Week 0 ) centrally randomize use permuted-block randomization list , equal allocation four treatment arm : 10 mg , 20 mg 30 mg PO BID apremilast placebo . In effort mitigate dose-dependent adverse effect apremilast ( e.g. , headache gastrointestinal disturbance ) , participant dose titrated 7-day period ( Days 1 through7 ) . Participants receive 10 mg PO BID apremilast identically-appearing placebo Days 1 2 . Participants randomize 10 mg BID dose continue take dose throughout treatment phase study . Those participant randomize 20 mg BID dose dose titrate 20 mg PO BID apremilast identically-appearing placebo Days 3 4 dosing . Participants randomize 20 mg BID dose continue take dose throughout treatment phase study . Those participant randomize 30 mg BID dose dose titrate 30 mg PO BID apremilast identically-appearing placebo Days 5 7 continue take dose throughout treatment phase study . At Week 16 , participant originally randomize placebo arm re-randomized 20 mg BID 30 mg BID apremilast . All participant ( i.e. , continue Apremilast dose regimen , well switch placebo apremilast ) receive drug Week 16 treatment arm blind fashion . In addition , participant transition placebo active medication Week 16 complete dose titration schedule help mitigate potential GI side effect may jeopardize blind treatment arm . At Week 24 ( end core study begin extension study ) , participant give option enroll extension study ( PSOR-005E NCT00953875 ) continue apremilast dosage receive end core study , Weeks 24-52 , total 28 week . Participants elect enter treatment extension study , complete 4-week observational follow-up phase core study . At Week 52 ( end extension study begin long-term extension study ) , participant give option enroll long term extension study ( PSOR-005LTE NCT01130116 ) , 4 additional year . Participants treat apremilast 10 mg BID extension study randomly assign dose titrate either apremilast 20 mg BID 30 mg BID . Participants dose 20mg 30 mg BID extension study continue receive dose long-term extension study . The long-term extension study anticipate complete May 2016 .</detailed_description>
