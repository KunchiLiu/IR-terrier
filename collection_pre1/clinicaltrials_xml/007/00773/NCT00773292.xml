	<brief_summary>HAM/TSP chronic disease spinal cord , cause virus call HTLV−I . Worldwide approximately 20 million person infected.Infection HTLV−I lifelong , 3 % infected person develop chronic debilitating disease , half become wheelchair dependent . We , others , show strong persistent immune response HTLV−I carrier patient HAM/TSP , fail clear virus . However , carrier low burden virus blood low risk develop disease . The immune response carrier seem well able kill infect cell . A less efficient response associate higher viral burden drive immune response resultant release chemical immune cell inadvertently cause harm , especially cell spinal cord . Our understanding HAM/TSP suggest target immune response improve health patient especially disease diagnosed early . To identify best type treatment plan series study drug target immune response different way . Each used inflammatory condition never study HAM/TSP . We aim study extent duration clinical response associate different effect therapy immune response number HTLV−I infect cell blood . This turn improve knowledge understand disease lead good therapy . This application relation first study − explore therapeutic benefit ciclosporin patient HAM/TSP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proof concept , open , observational study Ciclosporin treatment HTLV−I−associated myelopathy patient less 2 year disease new evidence progression . After two baseline assessment patient commence ciclosporin weight dependent dose ( 2.5 − 5mg/kg/day ) dose adjust accord plasma drug concentration . Participants monitor 11 occasion per schedule every 2 − 8 week ( less frequent time ) self−administered questionnaire relate quality life spasticity , regular assessment pain , time walk , spasticity , bladder bowel function blood test ensure safety therapy . Blood sample also collect , time point , investigation immune response HTLV−I quantity activity virus . At 5 key time point participant undergo detailed neurological examination , spinal cord image MRI , ( 12 week ) completion study fluid bathe brain ( CSF ) examine 12 week therapy . Therapy plan 12 month 6 month follow−up therapy continue discontinue accord clinical response .</detailed_description>
