	<criteria>Patients clinically significant* anastomotic leakage intend curative rectal resection ( LAR ) rectal cancer primary anastomosis . Patients whose operation include ileostomy must surgery create stoma within two day begin vacuum therapy randomization . Anastomotic leakage must diagnose within 21 day primary operation . Patients without preoperative radiation therapy may participate . Groups form accordingly , patient preoperative radiation therapy heal slowly . Patients anastomotic leakage ( diagnosed endoscopic radiology technique ) clinical sign symptom indicate health impairment ( fever , pain , elevate creatinine level ) .
