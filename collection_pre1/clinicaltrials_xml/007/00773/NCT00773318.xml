	<brief_summary>Nodal stag key-step pre-treatment assessment prostate cancer . In patient low probability nodal metastasis , bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy controversial . The large majority ( &gt; 80 % ) free nodal disease obturator external iliac station . On hand , skip metastasis locate outside standard lymphadenectomy may miss , particularly proximal nodal station ( i.e . common iliac node pre-sacral node ) . In prostate cancer , grow data indicate potential utility LM/SL , particularly patient low pre-test probability nodal disease . However , data report feasibility utility SPECT/CT follow LM/SL . In pilot study include 11 patient prostate cancer , Kizu colleague use software image fusion separate SPECT CT study . These author conclude utility image fusion localize anatomically SLNs . They also suggest use hardware fusion single gantry SPECT/CT device accurate detection SLNs . Accordingly , Corvin colleague recently report suitability sentinel node detection series 28 patient prostate cancer ; study , integrate single slice SPECT/CT device use localize SLNs . In light encourage data literature preliminary clinical experience , hypothesize use integrate SPECT/low-dose multislice CT guide LM/SL may clinical interest patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SPECT-CT Guided Lymphatic Mapping Sentinel Lymphadenectomy ( LM/SL ) Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multidisciplinary team ( urologist , oncologist , radiologist , pathologist , nuclear medicine ) ass technical feasibility LM/SL SPECT/CT well clinical potential stag regional lymph node 30 consecutive patient AJCC stage I-II-III prostate cancer schedule prostatectomy pelvic lymph node dissection accord standard care . This 2-day protocol single isotopic tracer ( Tc99m-cysteine rhenium colloid , 10-15 nm ) . The tracer injection perform trans-rectal ultra-sound guidance ( 1 inj/lobe , 74MBq , 0.2 cc ) . The first day injection day ( D0 ) , early imaging session planar acquisition ( anterior posterior view ) perform within 30 min post-tracer injection . A delayed imaging session planar SPECT/CT acquisition also perform 1 3 hour tracer injection . The SPECT/CT device use research protocol Infinia Hawkeye 4-slice GE Healthcare . This hybrid camera incorporate low-dose CT 2.5 mA current ( eff.dose &lt; 2mSv ) dual-head gamma camera . SPECT/CT data analyse Xeleris 2.05v ( Volumetrix Hawkeye Oncology ) . The second day ( D+1 post-tracer injection ) , prostate cancer patient undergo radical prostatectomy complete pelvic lymph node dissection ( CLND ) . Sentinel lymph node ( SLNs ) detect intra-operatively use gamma probe ( Navigator , Tyco Healthcare ) . In single tracer study , SLNs define hot node include hot node hot node ≥ 10 % hottest node . In SPECT/CT protocol , additional non-radioactive node eventually detect CT component suspicious tumor involvement ( lymphadenopathy &gt; 1cm ) also remove , especially lymph node locate unpredictable lymphatic basin . Surgery perform surgeon . SLNs non-SLNs analyzed pathologist . For SLNs , Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin staining ( H-E ) firstly perform . If negative , 3 H-E stain level perform immuno-peroxidase stain Cytokeratins AE1/AE3 , PSA , PAP . Non-SLNs analyze accord routine protocol 3 H-E stained level . The SLN feature note : number , anatomical localization vivo , count rate ex vivo . The pathological characteristic metastatic SLNs non-SLNs precisely record : size , involvement ( micro-metastases ≤ 2mm ; macro-metastases ; isolate tumor cell ) , % node involve ( small &lt; 25 % ; moderate = 25-75 % ; massive &gt; 75 % ) .</detailed_description>
