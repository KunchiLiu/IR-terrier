	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluating Characteristic Closure Patterns Normal Velopharyngeal Portal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Televex videofluoroscopy utilizes real-time , x-ray imaging visualize velopharyngeal port multiple view plane . The view generally utilized include lateral , base frontal . This technique require subject provide specific speech pattern , present speech pathologist , radiologist obtains adequate view velopharyngeal ( VP ) port . Each procedure take 3 5 minute . Fluoroscopic image provide speech task swallow limit radiation exposure . 1 ) The radiologist begin take lateral view speaking , allow view velum posterior pharyngeal wall speech production , well evaluation cranial base angle , size location adenoid tissue , velar length , velar thickness velar stretch . 2 ) The speech pathologist give subject barium sulfate contrast , approximately 2 4 oz , swallow , allow well structure delineation , well confirmation presence palatal fistula barium pass palate swallowing . 3 ) The speech pathologist place subject supine position barium sulfate instill nasal passage bilaterally via syringe , approximately 5 ml . approximately 2 . 5 ml nostril . This allow nasopharyngeal coat structure . 4 ) The speech pathologist place subject prone table position sphinx position head neck extend forearm palm flat fluoroscopic table . The head , shoulder neck position find base view velopharyngeal port . This view afford ability obtain velopharyngeal closure pattern size velopharyngeal defect similar nasopharyngoscopy . 5 ) The next view obtain radiologist frontal anterior-posterior . This obtained head/neck extend allow evaluation degree lateral pharyngeal wall motion . 6 ) The final view obtain radiologist repeat initial lateral view time nasopharyngeal coat place . This beneficial confirming VPI presence small VP gap . During coated lateral view blow barium VP port observe . Additionally barium dissipate velopharyngeal closure indicative anatomic VPI . This do radiology department take approximately 3 minute 5 minute .</detailed_description>
