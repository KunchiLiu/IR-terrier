	<brief_summary>The identification characterization individual vary response exercise-induced weight loss important . Weight loss response exercise variable remain unknown succeed , , importantly improve weight loss efficacy . This study examine change behavioural , metabolic , physiological biochemical variable response 12 week supervise exercise programme evaluate association weight loss overweight obese sedentary individual . Our hypothesis change plasma level appetite relate hormone undermine inter individual variation weight loss response exercise . This study improve understanding variability exercise-induced weight loss allow individually tailored appropriate strategy weight management programme .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose - To identify predictor weight loss overweigh/obese volunteer follow 12 week supervise exercise programme , characterise variability weight loss response . Method - Longitudinal study aim identify predictor weight loss response 12-week exercise programme healthy overweight/obese volunteer . Subjective objective measure appetite , cardiovascular fitness , anthropometry , body composition , rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) , fat carbohydrate oxidation fast state measure baseline , participant enroll study exercise intervention . The preload/test-meal paradigm ( use high low-energy preload : HEP v LEP ) use assess short-term appetite control exercise intervention follow randomize single-blinded crossover design . Moreover , long-term effect exercise cytokine plasma level fast postprandial level appetite relate hormones/metabolites also assess baseline end study . Participants act control throughout study .</detailed_description>
