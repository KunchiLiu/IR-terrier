	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , carmustine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together carmustine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together carmustine work treat patient relapsed progressive high-grade glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Carmustine Treating Patients With Relapsed Progressive High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine 6-month progression-free survival patient relapse progressive high-grade glioma treat bevacizumab carmustine . Secondary - To evaluate radiographic response regimen measure MRI PET scan image fusion . - To utilize novel brain image differentiate radiographic response due tumor shrinkage radiographic response due decrease vasogenic edema . - To evaluate safety toxicity regimen patient . - To evaluate overall survival patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV day -7 , 8 , 22 , 36 , 50 course 1 day 8 , 22 , 36 , 50 subsequent course . Patients also receive carmustine IV 4 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 56 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
