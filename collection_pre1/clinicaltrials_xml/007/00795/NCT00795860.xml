	<brief_summary>Clearly effect diet exercise beneficial obese person , underlie mechanisms improvement metabolic health completely clear . Although mount evidence suggest alteration lipid metabolism person abdominal obesity associate several medical complication , include diabetes , little known factor responsible effect . The project application design examine addition endurance exercise train weight-loss program alters whole-body fatty acid availability , uptake , oxidation well expression cellular factor regulate process . In addition , evaluate whether alteration associated improvement insulin sensitivity . In end , experiment provide insight cellular whole-body adaptation fatty acid metabolism response weight-loss exercise training may lead enhancement insulin sensitivity . Identifying relationship gene expression , whole-body fatty acid metabolism clinical outcome measurement , insulin sensitivity , may lead improvement therapeutic and/or preventative approach obesity co-morbidities .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite robust finding emphasize importance weight-loss exercise prevention management insulin resistance Type 2 diabetes , mechanism responsible improvement metabolic health completely understood . Mounting evidence suggest abnormality fatty acid metabolism person abdominal obesity associate insulin resistance . Alterations fatty acid mobilization oxidation may primary adaptation responsible improvement metabolic health weight-loss endurance exercise training . We hypothesize disparity muscle fatty acid uptake oxidation regulate expression gene protein participate intracellular transport , trafficking , metabolism fatty acid . We believe alteration expression factor response weight-loss endurance exercise training underlie change non-oxidative disposal fatty acid , thereby improve insulin sensitivity . We determine effect weight-loss exercise training whole-body fatty acid mobilization oxidation expression factor regulate process skeletal muscle . In addition , evaluate alteration associate improvement insulin sensitivity . These study provide insight cellular alteration weight-loss exercise training accompany change whole-body fatty acid metabolism may lead improvement metabolic health .</detailed_description>
