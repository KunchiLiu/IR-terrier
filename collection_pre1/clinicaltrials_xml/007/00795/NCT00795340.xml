	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Cediranib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether cediranib effective placebo give together paclitaxel carboplatin treat patient non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well cediranib work give together paclitaxel carboplatin treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare overall survival patient stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer treat cediranib v placebo administer combination paclitaxel carboplatin . Secondary - To compare progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - To compare objective response rate patient treat regimen . - To estimate time response response duration patient treat regimen . - To evaluate nature , severity , frequency toxicity , include hemorrhage hemoptysis , patient treat regimen . - To compare pharmacokinetics paclitaxel two arm subset enrolled patient - To compare quality life patient treat regimen . - To determine incremental cost effectiveness cost utility ratio regimens . - To correlate expression tissue marker ( diagnosis ) outcomes response exploratory fashion OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify gender , center , disease stage ( IIIB v IV ) , weight loss ( &lt; 5 % vs 5-10 % v unknown ) , prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral cediranib daily day 1-21 paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily day 1-21 paclitaxel carboplatin arm I . Treatment arm repeat every 21 day 4 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , day 1 course , periodically thereafter . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 12 week .</detailed_description>
