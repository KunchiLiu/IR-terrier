	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives To estimate pathological complete response rate follow neoadjuvant radiotherapy concurrent capecitabine oxaliplatin , without cetuximab base KRAS mutation status rectal cancer . Secondary Objectives 1 . To evaluate incidence grade 3-4 toxicity two neoadjuvant regimen 30-day post-operative period . 2 . To estimate clinical tumour response rate sphincter preservation rate two neoadjuvant regimen . 3 . To correlate EGRF gene amplification pathological response rate treat cetuximab . 4 . To estimate pattern failure . 5 . To establish annotated tissue library sample obtain prior therapy follow therapy ( time surgery ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Radiotherapy Rectal Cancer Using Oxaliplatin , Capecitabine With Without Cetuximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims : The primary aim study estimate pathological complete response rate follow neoadjuvant radiotherapy concurrent capecitabine oxaliplatin ( CAPOX ) , without cetuximab base KRAS mutation status rectal cancer . Hypothesis : Cetuximab , monoclonal antibody target EGF receptor , active metastatic colorectal cancer radio-sensitizer . In colorectal cancer , presence KRAS mutation associate absence response cetuximab . We hypothesise addition cetuximab CAPOX concurrent neoadjuvant radiotherapy benefit patient whose tumour KRAS mutation therefore , personalize cetuximab therapy base tumour KRAS mutation status may yield high pathological response . Methods : This study employ standard 2-stage Phase II design evaluate efficacy tolerability two neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimen . The assignment neoadjuvant chemotherapy determine KRAS mutation status tumor . Subjects KRAS mutation receive CAPOX . Subjects KRAS mutation randomize receive CAPOX +/- cetuximab.Definitive surgery schedule 6-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy . Surgical management sphincter preservation approach whenever possible , use total mesorectal excision technique.After operation , pathologic evaluation surgical specimen perform . Significance : In proof-of-concept study , aim demonstrate use enriched patient cohort test hypothesis addition cetuximab yield higher pathological response rate KRAS mutation-negative rectal cancer . This approach potentially identify subset patient may benefit cetuximab spare may benefit unnecessary treatment toxicity cost . Our study help prioritise novel target agent small , faster , less expensive confirmatory phase III trial .</detailed_description>
