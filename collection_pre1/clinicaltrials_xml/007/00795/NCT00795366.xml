	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) among lead cause trauma death disability civilian military population . The damage occur instant trauma modify ; secondary injury occur afterward impediment recovery influence physician . Cerebral ischemia important secondary event determine outcome follow TBI . To minimize ischemic episode patient arrive hospital , treatment aim optimize cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) . The cornerstones treatment include mannitol , reduce intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , catecholamine , phenylephrine ( PE ) , increase mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , agent undesired side effect . Nevertheless , lose potency , alternative . The main objective proposal develop new therapeutic option CPP management TBI patient use arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) . AVP endogenous anti-diuretic hormone . It FDA-approved use diagnosis treatment diabetes insipidus , prevention treatment post-operative abdominal distention , abdominal radiography dispel interfere gas shadow . It use off-label several condition . There minimal information therapeutic potential TBI . The investigator demonstrate AVP fluid resuscitation rapidly restore hemodynamics , CPP , improve acute survival clinically-relevant model TBI . The investigator observe similar short term benefit chest liver trauma . Nevertheless , AVP action could mask short term benefit . The investigator already define risk benefit AVP therapy , relative PE , four different clinically-relevant laboratory model . The investigator plan evaluate new therapy relative current evidence-based guideline CPP management TBI patient . The work hypothesis risk/benefit profile AVP equal , superior , PE equi-effective dos management CPP follow TBI . A corollary high CPP safely tolerate AVP v catecholamine . THE INVESTIGATORS AIM TO : Determine whether AVP safe effective maintain CPP = 60 mm Hg TBI patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vasopressin Versus Catecholamines Cerebral Perfusion Pressure Control Brain Injured Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , control , open-label clinical trial compare vasopressin catecholamine cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) control traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Once neurosurgeon consult patient present TBI , review entry criterion refer study personnel obtain informed consent . After informed consent , subject randomize one 2 group receive either catecholamine discretion attend physician vasopressin ( AVP ) . A 6 hour dose non-study drug permit prior initiation study drug . The amount study drug titrate maintain cerebral perfusion pressure within normal limit . Subjects follow maintain CPP without vasopressor medication . Data collection include amount duration vasopressor therapy result cerebral perfusion pressure time successful weaning vasopressor therapy . All subsequent clinical care discretion attend physician . The standard protocol/procedure discontinuation drug arm study follow : Vasopressors discontinue step-wise fashion , regardless specific agent specific ICU patient population . In patient severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) maintain 60 70 mmHg vasopressor . When intracranial pressure ( ICP ) begin correct ( decrease ) , vasopressor titrate downward slowly maintain CPP . This continue ICP normalized systemic hemodynamics able support normal CPP . At point , vasopressor withdraw completely . This process standard regardless choice vasopressor .</detailed_description>
