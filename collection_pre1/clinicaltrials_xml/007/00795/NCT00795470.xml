	<brief_summary>Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) common infection patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) increase length stay mortality . It know whether antibiotic treatment alter outcomes . Our previous study document wide practice variation exist amongst doctor , include prescribe antibiotic asymptomatic patient . Therefore , merit various way manage infection require study minimize potential over-prescribing antibiotic , practice increase development resistant bacteria . The objective pilot study determine feasibility conduct large definitive study determine effect catheter change and/or systemic antibiotic compare intervention outcomes resource utilization ICU patient UTI . Patients randomize receive treatment , antibiotic alone , urine catheter change alone , catheter change antibiotic . Their clinical outcome assess . Results pilot trial provide information whether feasible conduct large definitive trial . Results definitive study provide guidance clinician manage frequent clinical problem optimize antibiotic usage .</brief_summary>
