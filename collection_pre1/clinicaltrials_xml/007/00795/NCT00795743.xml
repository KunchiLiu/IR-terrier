	<brief_summary>Hypothesis test : placement central venous catheter induce systemic hypercoagulable state . To determine , investigator measure thromboelastography ( TEG ) , PT ( prothrombin time ) , PTT ( partial thromboplastin time ) , Prothrombin Fragment 1.2 , Factor VIII , VonWillebrand 's Factor . In addition , duplex ultrasound perform correlate laboratory coagulation value functional change ( i.e . deep venous thrombosis ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We enroll patient get Central Venous Catheter ( CVC ) place either PICC Insertion Room surgical intensive care unit undergoing emergent central venous catheter placement medically indicate reason . All patient previous central line get catheter exchange guide wire eligible . At Baseline : We intend evaluate patient Deep Vein Thrombosis conduct duplex ultrasound low extremity prior line insertion . We also collect one sample blood baseline within 3 hour insertion . During CVC Insertion : One sample blood collect CVC insertion . Follow Up : The last blood sample collect soon CVC insertion ( approximately 3hrs ) . Blood sample draw available collect . Thus , define `` sample convenience '' . We also conduct another duplex ultrasound extremities CVC insertion evaluation DVT . Data collect duplex ultrasound result , type central line exact insertion site . Should DVT find , attend physician make aware accord clinical protocol . Normally , moment central venous puncture , 5cc blood aspirate waste confirm correct placement needle tip placement guidewire . For intended study , instead waste blood , save 500 microliters coagulation analysis . Immediately catheter inserted guidewire , chest x-ray obtain verify position catheter . At point , port central venous catheter aspirate wasted infusion central venous catheter . For purpose study , save 500 microliters waste blood coagulation analysis . To clarify , second 500 microliters draw newly place central venous catheter port save ( instead draw waste ) . Drawing back port infuse standard practice . This second sample contain small amount saline , , base trial animal lab , saline unlikely effect coagulation analysis . In summary , intend visit patient 3 time approximately 4 hour period purpose collect blood would normally otherwise waste ( total 1500 microliters ) . This do patient undergoing procedure medically indicate reason medical care change , affect , otherwise alter base involvement study . Our purpose simply collect 3 sample blood emergent central venous catheter placement would otherwise waste biohazard container . We use blood assay prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , thromboelastography , Prothrombin Fragment 1.2 , Factor VIII , VonWillebrand 's Factor .</detailed_description>
