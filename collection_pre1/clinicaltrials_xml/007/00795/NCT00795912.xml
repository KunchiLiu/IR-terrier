	<brief_title>A Study Of The Usage Of Statins In A Community Heart Failure Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart Failure ( HF ) remain major public health problem . Despite significant advance pharmacological management condition , high mortality associate heart failure remain concern annual figure range 10 - 15 % mildly symptomatic patient 50 - 60 % patient severe heart failure.1 The major aetiological cause HF ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) . While guideline treatment IHD recommend use lipid lower therapy hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) improve prognosis , recent survey UK show effective therapy under-utilised.2 The reason appear multifactorial include issue related efficacy , safety , potential adverse drug reaction , failure prescribe appropriate medication dose noncompliance therapy.3 Some data large trial statin suggestive benefit . In 4S study 412 patient ( 9.2 % study population ) develop chronic heart failure require treatment , i.e . 228 ( 10.3 % ) placebo group 184 ( 8.3 % ) patient group treat simvastatin ( p &lt; 0.015 ) . However , several question remain , least statin might beneficial set symptomatic heart failure.4 Treatment heart failure target certain extent cause - case majority heart failure patient , cause related ischemic heart disease , perhaps , atherosclerosis . Furthermore , believe non-lipid lowering effect statin , include neoangiogenesis , inhibition proinflammatory cytokine activity , anti-fibrotic effect favorable modulation autonomic nervous system , could play positive role medical management HF.5,6 However , several specific concern , clinician may relation use statin heart failure . The average age community heart failure population generally 70 year observational data Framingham suggest inverse relationship total cholesterol level all-cause mortality old patients.5 There association total cholesterol level le 5.2 mmol/L impair one-year event free survival large group patient heart failure.6 Statins deleterious effect myocardial function thus adverse effect skeletal cardiac muscle due inhibition synthesis mevalonate , precursor ubiquinone.7 Elevated level marker C-reactive protein , TNF alpha inflammatory cytokine associate poor outcome patient HF , exclude clear source infection inflammatory disorder , elevate C-reactive protein correlate NYHA functional class associate high level morbidity.9 Several therapy HF , notably ACE inhibition AII Receptor Blockade show anti-cytokine effects.10 Statins show reduce level circulate inflammatory cytokine IHD . Recent data use atorvastatin suggest significant reduction C-reactive protein level see patient high pre-existing levels.11 Chronic inflammation promote excessive cardiomyocyte loss , cardiac fibroblast proliferation , increase rate extracellular matrix ( ECM ) turnover alter composition ECM result reduced functional performance heart.12-17 Natriuretic peptide show useful marker screen , diagnosis treatment monitor heart failure . New data suggest BNP may important counter-regulatory protein operate natriuretic peptide receptor type-A ( NPRA ) protective response , stretch volume overload myocardium13 also myocardial fibrosis inflammation.18 In summary , clinical practice point view usage statins heart failure population may reflect ongoing debate efficacy , safety potential adverse drug interaction patient population . From mechanistic point view , potential benefit statin heart failure may relate direct improvement ischemia and/or cardiac function may mediate via suppression inflammatory cytokine , alteration myocardial fibrosis may unrelated cholesterol lower effect . This project two phase follow objective : [ Objective 1 ] To evaluate usage statin community heart failure population admit institution . [ Objective 2 ] To study impact statin therapy natriuretic peptide , inflammatory marker marker fibrosis population heart failure normal cholesterol To evaluate objective 2 , prospective , randomize , open-label study mild moderate HF patient approve St Vincent 's University Hospital ethic committee . All recruit patient give informed consent randomize use computer generate protocol atorvastatin therapy [ Intervention group ( I ) ] statin therapy [ Control group ( C ) ] six month period . Additionally , group individual without heart failure prove cardiovascular disease normal cholesterol enrol purpose baseline comparison ( Normal group ) . In randomized study , patient mild moderate HF ( NYHA class II-III ) aetiology document leave ventricular systolic dysfunction ( LVEF &lt; 45 % ) echocardiography within 3 month randomization . These patient clinically stable , optimal HF medical therapy remain unaltered least four week prior recruitment . All normal fasting total cholesterol ( TC &lt; 5.1 mmol/L ) . The following patient exclude study : receiving lipid lower agent ; absolute relative contraindication statin ; know chronic inflammatory condition ; patient medical condition require anti-inflammatory immuno-suppressive therapy . The exclusion criterion apply Normal group . In addition optimal HF therapy , I group ( n=28 ) receive atorvastatin titrate 10-40 mg/day 3 month maintain 40mg/day 3 month . The C group ( n=28 ) receive optimal HF medication . Patients undergo routine clinical examination heart failure unit , include clinical history , physical examination chest X-Ray appearance . Fasting Blood sample take stored subsequent measurement cholesterol , FBC , High Sensitivity CRP , TNF alpha , IL-6 , U &amp; E , TFT , BNP marker collagen turnover . 12-lead ECG Echocardiography perform baseline six month . The Minnesota Living With Heart Failure ( MLWHF ) questionnaire self-administered baseline 6 month . The Normal group underwent phlebotomy baseline enable comparison HF study sample . Routine clinical review heart failure unit carry trial , include clinical examination FBC ( include LFTs ) , U &amp; E assessment side effect . The patient advise attend general practitioner non heart failure relate problem . Comparisons Normal group randomize study patient ( C I group ) baseline make use independent t-test , Mann Whitney chi square test appropriate . Due non normal distribution biochemical marker lipid , Friedman 's ANOVA use test treatment effect study period . Pairwise comparison make use Wilcoxon test . Repeated measure analysis variance ( RM ANOVA ) use test treatment effect quality life ( QOL ) LVEF . To enable statistical control effect age gender , non normal variable log transform RM ANCOVA fit data . Correlations compute use Spearman 's rank order correlation .</detailed_description>
