	<brief_summary>An increase incidence aneuploid pregnancy report woman advance maternal age , high miscarriage rate . Cytogenetic study preimplantation embryos show elevated aneuploidy rate , particularly woman 38 year . For reason , PGS apply patient improve ongoing implantation rate , importantly , decrease risk miscarriage affect offspring . In past two year , several RCT raise question whether PGS benefitial AMA patient . In experience , PGS outcome patient offer high ongoing implantation rate previously publish RCT study , benefit PGS find . In paper , poor technical skill , well unclear patient selection could explain report lack PGS benefit . Therefore , objective present RCT analyze outcome IVF cycle without PGS two age group : - Patients 38-39 year age : 200 cyles per arm reaching embryo transfer perform - Patients 40-44 year age : 120 cycle per arm reaching embryo transfer Sample size calculate accord retrospective experience high difference ongoing implantation rate cycle without PGS patient 40-44 year age . In patient embryo transfer perform day 5 . In PGS group one cell biopsy embryo â‰¥5 cell day-3 chromosome 13 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 21 , 22 , X Y analyze two round . In third round , nuclei undoubtful non-conclusive result analyze use subtelomeric probe .</brief_summary>
