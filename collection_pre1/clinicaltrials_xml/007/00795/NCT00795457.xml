	<brief_summary>This pilot vaccine study adult either WHO grade II astrocytoma , oligoastrocytoma oligodendroglioma . The purpose study test safety efficacy experimental tumor vaccine make peptide Montanide ISA-51 combination study drug Poly-ICLC . Poly-ICLC , manufacture Oncovir , Inc. , already receive generally well tolerated subject earlier study show decrease size brain tumor case . The immunological safety data use decide whether large study clinical efficacy warrant two patient cohort .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must document pathological diagnosis WHO grade II astrocytoma oligoastrocytoma oligodendroglioma ( see also 4th bullet oligodendroglioma ) . HLAA2 positive base flow cytometry . There 2 cohort patient base whether patient receive prior RT . Cohort 1 : patient must undergo surgery biopsy alone ≤16 week prior study entry ( postoperative radiation chemotherapy ) . Cohort 2 : Patients receive surgery biopsy radiation therapy ( RT ) ( include fractionate external beam radiation therapy and/or stereotactic radiosurgery ) , complete ≥6 month prior enrollment , baseline MRI scan ( within 4 week first vaccine ) show stable disease regression . For oligodendroglioma , least one follow three condition meet : 1 ) age ≥ 40 extent resection ; 2 ) age 1839 incomplete resection ( postop MRI show &gt; 1cm residual disease , base maximum dimension residual T2 FLAIR abnormality edge surgical cavity either laterally , anteroposteriorly , superoinferiorly ) 3 ) age 1839 neurosurgeondefined GTR tumor size ≥ 4 cm ( maximum preoperative tumor diameter , base axial and/or coronal T2 FLAIR MR image ) . Participants must ≥ 18 year old safety therapeutic component establish child . All participant must sign informed consent document indicate aware investigational nature study . Participants must Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 ( Appendix I ) . Documented negative serum beta HCG female participant childbearing age . Males female must agree , consent form , use effective birth control method course vaccination . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother peptide base vaccine polyICLC , breastfeed discontinue mother treat study . Participants must free systemic infection Participants adequate organ function measure white blood count ≥ 2500/mm3 ; lymphocyte ≥ 800/mm3 ; platelet ≥ 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL , AST , ALT , GGT , LDH , alkaline phosphatase within 2.5 x upper normal limit , total bilirubin great equal 2.0 mg/dL , serum creatinine within 1.5 X upper limit normal limit . Coagulation test PT PTT within normal limit . Presence cranial spinal leptomeningeal metastatic disease . Prior chemotherapy antiglioma therapy type radiation therapy ( see 3.1.3 ) Concurrent treatment medication include : Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Interferon Allergy desensitization injection Growth factor Interleukins Any investigational therapeutic medication Participants must prior autoimmune disorder require cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy , autoimmune disorder visceral involvement . Participants active autoimmune disorder require therapy also exclude . Mild arthritis require NSAID medication exclusionary . Use immunosuppressives within 4 week prior study entry anticipate use immunosuppressive agent . Dexamethasone , corticosteroid medication , use perioperative period and/or radiotherapy , must taper discontinue least 4 week administration first vaccine . Topical corticosteroid Inhaled steroid acceptable . Participants another cancer diagnosis , except follow diagnosis allow : squamous cell cancer skin without know metastasis basal cell cancer skin without know metastasis carcinoma situ breast ( DCIS LCIS ) carcinoma situ cervix cancer without distant metastasis treat successfully , without evidence recurrence metastasis 5 year Participants know addiction alcohol drug . Because patient immune deficiency expect respond therapy , HIV positive patient exclude study .</criteria>
