	<detailed_description>Version number 1.0 Date 07.05.0808 Study Title A phase-II clinical trial assess clinical impact global strategy utilize early FDG-PET image risk-adapted therapy untreated , advance Hodgkin Lymphoma ( aHL ) . Short study title PET-adapted chemotherapy advance HL Start end date study Start date : July 2008 Patients recruit four calendar year follow least three year . Registration patient All patient newly diagnose Hodgkin 's Lymphoma , present advanced disease ( stage II B-IV B ) register WEB site study whatever treatment plan . Primary outcome measure 3-year progression free survival ( PFS ) . Secondary endpoint 3-year event free survival ( EFS ) register patient whatever treatment assign . Events deaths cause , disease progression , secondary cancer , late serious treatment-related event . - Feasibility program entire population advanced-stage HL patient admit GITIL institution Clinical Phase Phase II Study design A multicentre clinical trial assess clinical impact global strategy utilize early FDG-PET image 2 cycle ABVD risk-adapted , single patient tailor therapy newly diagnose , aHL patient admit GITIL haematological center . Statistical aspect 450 patient could recruit GITIL centre 4 year . Thirty-five percent could expect PET-2 positive 2 ABVD course ( 135 patient ) . Roughly half latter could likely salvage BEACOPPescal . R-BEACOPPescal . therapy . Since 3-y PFS aHL patient treat ABVD 70 % could expect cure , approach , 85 % patient . In order demonstrate benefit strategy conventional ABVD treatment , Simon optimal two-stage design alpha error 0.05 power 90 % , minimum 150 patient need enrol . In order establish advantage R-BEACOPP esc . BEACOPPescal . Approximately 135 patient need arm PET-positive patient . Analysis intention-to-treat . Standard time-to-event statistic test carry , include Kaplan-Meier survival curve , log rank test , Cox proportional hazard model . Chi square test analysis variance adopt univariate analysis mathematical transformation approach normality appropriate . The formal level significance P-values set 0.05 ( two-tailed ) . Interim analysis safety aspects A first interim analysis plan one year study onset order check morbidity mortality program . Because rarity disease , formal statistical boundary establish stop rule . The result interim analysis evaluate Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . The Chairman DSMB advise Steering Committee ( ST ) action take safety reason ( i.e. , premature study closure protocol modification ) . The DSMB also establish communicate ST CRO rule requirement optimize quantity quality information periodically receive monitor adequately safety aspect . Initial treatment 2 cycle ABVD ( cycle repeat every 28 day ) This give full dose schedule , regardless blood count . Growth factor may use discretion investigator routinely advise . PET Reviewing Committee A central panel PET reviewing ( PET-RC ) establish . The member seven nuclear medicine expert . The operational aspect validation PET diagnose manage National Institute Nuclear Physics Turin use already exist function web-site . Upon receipt PET-2 record , along PET baseline study via web , PET-RC member bound send review study Central Data Center ( CDC ) within 5 day data receipt study local PET enter . The image exchange perform uploading record PET-2 ( PET 2 cycle ABVD ) PET-0 ( baseline PET ) .dycom format web site dedicated.Only positive `` minimally positive '' PET scan review . The final judgment review define `` positive '' `` negative '' study supply CDC local GITIL center basis first three reviewed study arrive CDC After 2 cycle , PET negative patient ( Arm B ) continue ABVD ( 4 cycle ) ABVD , every 28 day 4 cycle Patients Arm B positive PET end ABVD treatment . Patients positive PET end ABVD chemotherapy undergo , whenever possible , confirmatory biopsy ; patient prove resistant disease DHAP ( x1 x2 ) give order collect sufficient number CD 34+ cell ; later proceed classical high-dose sequential chemotherapy ( HDS ) : cyclophosphamide 4 gr./m2 , ARA-c 4 gr./m2/day 4 day , VP 16 2 gr./m2 , follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) BEAM condition regimen Consolidation Radiotherapy ( Arm B ) Patients treat traditional ABVD x 6 cycle ( PET-negative arm ) re-evaluated end chemotherapy PET . Patients negative final PET scan randomize undergo consolidation radiotherapy initial bulky lesion ( ) residual disease . Radiotherapy give `` involved field technique , dose 30 Gy . No radiotherapy plan patient residual mass initial bulky lesion . After 2 cycle , PET positive patient ( Arm A ) randomize 4 escalate BEACOPP 4 escalate R-BEACOPP administration 4 cycle . Peripheral Blood Stem Cell ( PBSC ) collect first BEACOPP ( R-BEACOPP ) course After 4 cycle escalate BEACOPP escalate R-BEACOPP patient PET negative continue baseline BEACOPP baseline R-BEACOPP ( 4 cycle ) After 4 cycle escalate BEACOPP escalate R-BEACOPP patient positive PET undergo salvage treatment DHAP ( x 1 x 2 ) follow double autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) , presence suitable HLA-matched stem cell donor , single ASCT ( BEAM ) follow RIC allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . Allogeneic Reduced-Intensity transplant : Thiotepa 5 mg/Kg every 12 hour 2 dos ( day -5 ) ; cyclophosphamide 30 mg/kg ( day -4 -3 ) ; fludarabine 30 mg/ms ( day -4 -3 ) ; allogeneic stem cell transplantation 4 - 8 X 106 CD34+ cells/kg relate donor ( day 0 ) . GVHD prophylaxis : Cyclosporin A ( CSA ) , adjust 200-300 ng/ml blood level , short course methotrexate ( 10 mg/ms day +1 , 8 mg/ms day + 3 +6 ) . CSA administer full dose day +100 , GVHD occur , dose tapered 10 % every week thereafter Treatment duration Approx 10-11 month PET-2+ patient 6 month PET-2 negative patient</detailed_description>
