	<brief_summary>Patients present wound care center management wound evaluate clinically establish wound chronic acute . These patient undergo standard care management wound . If debridement indicate patient , patient ask participate study . Once standard care debridement complete , material debrided wound , instead discard biohazard bag , prepared shipment . The sample ship Center Biofilm Engineering microscopic evaluation conduct material . Conclusion make analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A planktonic concept bacteria present surface chronic wound longer viable . Microscopic study show biofilm present chronic wound yet seem prominent surface acute wound . Biofilm able neutralize host defense commandeer host system , posse impressive array defense virulence factor . Clinically see significant difference heal behavior chronic acute wound . Also , suppression biofilm use multiple simultaneous strategy include debridement , anti-biofilm agent , specific biocides , antibiotic advance technology improve wound heal . This suggest biofilm play important role delay wound healing .</detailed_description>
