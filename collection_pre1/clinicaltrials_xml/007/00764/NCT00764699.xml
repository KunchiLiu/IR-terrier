	<brief_summary>Patients Crohn disease often poor weight gain short stature , yet etiology poor growth well define . Studies chronically ill patient Crohn disease suggest inflammation cause IGF-1 deficiency due inadequate IGF-1 generation . Previous study GH use Crohn patient demonstrate improvement linear growth , weight bone mineralization . However , GH cause glucose intolerance chronically ill child , particularly require treatment corticosteroid . Recently FDA approve recombinant IGF-1 ( rhIGF ) treatment IGF-1 deficient short stature . This medication study Crohn disease . The purpose study test hypothesis poor growth Crohn disease associate abnormal IGF-1 generation lead poor linear growth , decrease weight osteoporosis replacement IGF-1 rhIGF correct growth improve bone density . To test hypothesis recruit 20 patient Crohn disease pediatric gastroenterology practice . Each previously diagnose Crohn disease minimum one year study baseline six month interval one year treatment Increlex .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Increlex® Children With Crohn Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Subjects . We recruit 20 establish Crohn patient gastroenterology ( GI ) referral practice Nationwide Children 's Hospital Columbus , Ohio . Each previously undergone complete diagnostic workup classification disease . Information disease activity , location behavior routinely record follow visit . Medical record assess information . These patient follow every three month . All patient assign receive rhIGF therapy 12 month result compare medical record data . We recruit 10 per year . 2 . Assessment growth IGF-1 generation . Each subject undergo IGF-1 generation test use standard publish `` high-dose : protocol interpret accord guideline Blum . Briefly , GH give one time per day subcutaneous injection dose 0.05mg/kg/dy . IGF-1 measured baseline 7 day . Inadequate generation interpret IGF-1 increase &lt; 15 ng/dl 7 day GH . We also measure baseline random GH IGFBP-3 level . The IGF-1 , GH IGFBP-3 level measure Esoterix laboratory ( Calabasas Hills , CA ) . IGF-1 level also measure every six month disease exacerbation . All patient single radiological film leave hand wrist determine bone age Greulich Pyle standard , routine examination PI determine Tanner stag . 3 . Anthropometric measure . Patients see every three month . At every visit , evaluate linear growth use calibrate stadiometer weight standardize scale . Longitudinal data use calculate height weight velocity . Height velocity annualized visit compare baseline data . All growth information , include velocity convert standard deviation score ( SDS , Z score ) use GenenCalc ( Genentech , San Francisco , CA ) . 4 . Nutrition . To assess low nutritional intake cause poor growth ( low IGF-1 level ) , patient complete 3 day food journal every visit result assess Nutrition Pro software . We evaluate finding pubertal prepubertal child . For reason carefully measure Tanner stage breast girl testicular volume boy . We measure testosterone level boys estradiol girl ( Esoterix ) . Sex steroid level correlate Tanner stag tempo pubertal progression . 5 . Treatment rhIGF ( Increlex , Tercica ) . Patients follow 12 month Increlex therapy . Increlex ( rhIGF ) administer per follow schema : First 2 week : 40 mcg/kg BID ; Weeks 3 4 : 80 mcg/kg BID ; Subsequent week : 120 mcg/kg BID . Each parent patient carefully trained injection technique skilled personnel . Compliance assessed subject return empty vial study site . 6 . Bone mineral content bone turnover . All subject undergo DXA scan ( Lunar Prodigy ) baseline every six month . Measurements compare age- gender- match normal convert Z score ( www.bcm.edu/bodycomplab ) . To determine bone turnover , blood urine collect baseline every six month . These lab run Esoterix accord method : N-Telopeptides ( reverse transcriptase PCR , urine ) , osteocalcin ( double antibody RIA , blood ) , bone specific alkaline phosphatase activity ( ICMA , blood ) , deoxypyridinoline ( ELISA , urine ) . Although typical patient treat GH demonstrate initial bone loss first six month , group document improvement bone mineral content within six month start GH therapy . 7 . Cytokines . We measure cytokines TNF-α , IL-1 , IL-6 initiation study , 6 month 12 month . This good help u understand role cytokine disease course , activity , growth hormone axis . 8 . Biomarkers rhIGF-1 dose efficacy . We draw BL , 6 mo 12 mo level IGF-1 , IGFBP3 ALS level . The baseline level collect prior 1st dose Increlex . At six month patient instructed take Increlex morning visit sample drawn within 2 hour dose represent peak biomarker level . The 12 month level obtain morning day patient complete his/her final dose represent trough level . 9 . Measures Disease Activity . At protein turnover measure ask subject bring stool sample evaluate fecal calprotectin . We complete Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index ( PCDAI ) , reliable valid index disease activity clinical research . Subjects complete IMPACT-III , valid reliable measure quality life pediatric Crohn disease .</detailed_description>
