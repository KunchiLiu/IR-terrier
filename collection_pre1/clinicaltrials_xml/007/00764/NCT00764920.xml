	<detailed_description>Normal lesional skin assess follow image modality : 1 . Laser Speckle Imaging provide information relative blood flow tissue . In skin use determine area blood flow whether particular intervention treatment affect blood flow . 2 . Optical Coherence Tomography Optical Doppler Tomography provide picture blood vessel area body also tell fast blood flow area . 3 . Photon Migration Spectroscopy provide information amount blood , oxygen , fat water tissue . 4 . Multi-Spectral Imaging provide 3 dimensional image structure within skin . 5 . Multiphoton Microscopy provide image structure skin .</detailed_description>
