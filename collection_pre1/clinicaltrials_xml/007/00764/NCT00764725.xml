	<brief_summary>The Swefot trial design compare two treatment strategy patient early rheumatoid arthritis ( less 1 year symptom duration ) : use combination traditional antirheumatic medication ( DMARDs ) , versus combination include new `` biological '' anti-TNF medication . In order make trial consistent current practice rheumatology , patient first give commonly use antirheumatic medication , methotrexate ( MTX ) . After 3-4 month patient respond adequately treatment randomize receive either MTX plus sulfasalazine plus hydroxychloroquine , MTX plus infliximab . Again , truly life-like , trial allow patient could tolerate one added medication switch treatment - keep strategy - sulfasalazine plus hydroxychloroquine could replace cyclosporin A , infliximab etanercept . The primary outcome trial percentage patient , one year treatment , achieve `` good response '' define Eular .</brief_summary>
