	<brief_summary>Phosphorus substance blood come food normally clear body kidney . In patient kidney disease , excess phosphorus may build body eat . This lead problem bone blood vessel time . In study , compare blood urine eat one week diet protein plant ( soy grain ) another one week diet protein animal ( meat dairy product ) . The amount phosphorus kidney put urine , change blood hormone response diet measure begin end week two diet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral Bone disorder ( CKD-MBD ) constellation problem related alteration mineral bone homeostasis occur CKD stage 3-5D ( estimate GFR 60-15 ml/min ) . The damage kidney unable fully excrete phosphorus load , lead compensatory secondary hyperparathyroidism attempt increase urinary phosphorus excretion order maintain serum phosphorus normal range . Eventually compensation elevate PTH become pathologic lead abnormality biochemistry , bone vascular disease , associate morbidity mortality patient CKD . Prevention complication key improve patient outcome . Unfortunately , normal high normal phosphorus reflect `` behind scene '' appropriate inappropriate compensation . The use medication bind phosphorus food ( phosphate binder ) may prevent absorption phosphorus across intestine prevent change elevation PTH hormone like FGF23 . Thus , either urinary excretion phosphorus , change hormone may appropriate end point evaluate efficacy phosphate binder serum phosphorus . In healthy individual , variation throughout day ( diurnal ) serum phosphorus urine phosphorus excretion , dialysis patient , variability appear lose . No data exist patient stage 3 4 ( pre-dialysis ) CKD . Intestinal phosphorus absorption also dependent bioavailability ( amount free phosphorus available absorb ) , differs depend protein source , phosphorus grain/soy diet less bioavailable protein animal/casein protein source . In animal model CKD , differences bioavailability impact urinary phosphorus excretion serum level FGF-23 , PTH . As phosphaturia , PTH , FGF23 may become important end point future clinical trial , understand diurnal variability relationship diet patient CKD 3 4 normal serum phosphorus level critical . We hypothesize dietary protein source affect hormonal response diurnal phosphorus homeostasis advance CKD . To test hypothesis , examine follow specific aim population CKD stage 3 4 subject Indiana University Affiliated Nephrology Clinics determine 1. dietary protein source affect fast serum urinary phosphorus excretion 2. protein source affect post prandial change serum urinary phosphorus patient 3. change plasma FGF23 PTH correlate urinary phosphorus excretion response different protein source . We conduct cross study assess blood urine one week diet differs source protein ( thus bioavailability phosphorus ) .</detailed_description>
