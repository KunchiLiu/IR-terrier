	<brief_title>A Study Home-based Exercise Intervention Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukaemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Fatigue common disable symptom affect patient acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) . Fatigue negatively associate quality life ( QOL ) daily function , remain major problem patient even 6 month completion treatment ( 12 month diagnosis ) . Despite , intervention study reduce fatigue improve QOL AML . In number study do mostly young patient solid tumour , exercise show improve fatigue QOL . Because important difference old patient AML young patient solid tumour , randomize trial need perform population . Prior embark definitive study , pilot study need ensure feasibility , estimate recruitment rate , demonstrate exercise effective reduce fatigue old patient AML . Objectives : ( 1 ) To determine feasibility recruitment , patient adherence , 12-week home-based exercise intervention study among patient age 40 old AML complete remission . ( 2 ) To provide estimate effect exercise fatigue QOL facilitate design RCT . ( 3 ) To examine relationship exercise adherence , improvement fitness , fatigue , QOL AML patient undergo home-based exercise intervention . Methods : Patients age 40 old AML complete chemotherapy achieve complete remission eligible study . Patients recruit Princess Margaret Hospital , Canada 's large AML referral centre . Fitness QOL measure assess baseline , half-way intervention , end 12-week exercise intervention , 12 week later . Patients randomize intervention arm wait-list control . The intervention consist structure , personalize , 12-week home-based exercise program theory-based modelled successful program patient another malignancy . A certified fitness instructor lead intervention . Patients wait-list control group ask maintain usual level activity 12 week , cross intervention arm receive identical intervention . Fitness measure include anthropometric measure , 6-minute walk test , grip strength , measure flexibility . The primary outcome measure fatigue , measure FACT Fatigue subscale . QOL assess EORTC QLQ-C30 . Weekly telephone assessment 5 in-clinic assessment duration program do measure program adherence . The investigator plan approach 100 patient 12-month period anticipate recruit 40 patient . A detailed recruitment log maintain . Mixed effect linear regression model use measure effect intervention fatigue QOL . Relationships change fitness level regress change fatigue QOL secondary analysis . The impact exercise adherence outcome also assess . Significance : Despite importance fatigue patient AML , treatment remain poorly understood.The investigator plan evaluate promising intervention , exercise , pilot study . The result study crucial design definitive multi-centre randomize trial lessen fatigue improve overall QOL middle-aged older patient AML .</detailed_description>
