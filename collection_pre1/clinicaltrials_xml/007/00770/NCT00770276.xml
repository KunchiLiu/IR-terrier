	<brief_summary>MOPS : Mannheim Obesity Pilot Study Introduction : Obesity central feature metabolic syndrome . With increase prevalence overweight obesity , incidence WHO III° obesity augment . In subset obese patient , metabolic complication cardiovascular risk major clinical issue . Epidemiological data show increase BMI mortality rise ( 1 ) . The SOS-Study demonstrate , first time , bariatric surgery consecutive weight reduction associate decrease cardiovascular overall mortality . Significant mortality study cause cardiovascular event cancer . Metabolic Syndrome - MS - Despite vary definition metabolic syndrome , obesity one central feature . Depending definition use , represent obligate criterion ( IDF ) facultative parameter ( WHO ATP III ) . Even though obligate , extreme obesity central risk factor parameter metabolic syndrome . Endothelial dysfunction -ED- represent initial step atherosclerosis ( 3 ) . An appropriate measurement evaluation retinal analysis . Epidemiological data demonstrate increase cardiovascular risk retinal vessel pathology ( 4 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods procedure Study design : We conduct prospective study obesity WHO III° consecutive enrollment . The study protocol approve local ethic committee . Patients recruit within integrated concept design individual seek weight reduction . This network encompass complex approach nutrition specialist , bariatric surgeon , endocrinologist , ENT specialist psychologist . Patients could present aforementioned specialist study inclusion . Those consented follow , conventional weight loss ( diet , activity ) bariatric surgery 1 year later . Evaluation : Using standardize form , evaluate medical obesity history well associate metabolic complication ( impaired glucose metabolism , elevate Cholesterol NASH ) . We inquire regular medication , related disease classic cardiovascular risk factor ( Framingham risk score : cardiovascular disease , family history cardiovascular disease , nicotine abuse arterial hypertension ) . Anthropometry - Subsequently , complete physical examination conduct , take consideration use adequate cuff measure blood pressure . We record circumference neck , arm waist ( midway low rib margin iliac crest , measure tape end gentle expiration ) . Body weight height determine calibrated scale near 0.1kg cm , respectively . Metabolism - Metabolic analysis perform overnight fast . Baseline measurement include blood glucose , insulin , cholesterol , HDL , LDL , triglycerides liver enzyme . Every individual without know diabetes screen presence impair glucose metabolism mean OGTT . To exclude endocrine obesity measure TSH level perform one mg dexamethasone suppression test . Intima medium thickness ( IMT ) - Measurement intima medium thickness right carotid artery perform order detect subclinical vascular disease . Imaging protocol execute accord consensus statement American Society Echocardiography ( 5 ) . Structural functional endothelial dysfunction : Arterial venous ratio ( AVR ) flicker reaction - DVA use digital fundus image well conventional fundus examination retinal vessel analysis ( RVA , imedos , Jena , Germany ) . Structural endothelial dysfunction determine arterial-venous ratio ( AVR ) . After mydriasis phenylephrine 10 % tropicamide 1 % , image centre macula , inferior arcade optic disc record eye . AVR calculate software mark artery vein within two diameter optic disc ( RVA , imedos , Jena , Germany ) . Functional endothelial dysfunction measure flicker reaction retinal vessel . This technique record dilatation retinal vessel exposure flicker light . We use 1.5 mm segment vessel within two disc diameter , show cross bifurcation , tortuosity &lt; 30° . After baseline calibration , flicker light show 20 second via interruption continuous light 12.5 Hz . During period 80 second , vessel diameter continuously measure . To achieve high reliability , procedure perform three time . Flicker artery vein express maximum percent baseline diameter . Adjustment eye movement perform automatically software . Details technique publish elsewhere ( 6-7 ) . BIA - Body composition determine preoperatively BIA . All patient require rest 30 minute , BIA perform apply 4 silver electrode , 2 detect electrode place ulnar aspect right wrist right medial malleolus . After connect electrodes multiple-frequency BIA instrument ( BIA 2000 , Data Input , Darmstadt , Germany ) , measurement record real time via computer . The calculation BCM , ECM , ECM/BCM , fat TBW perform use Nutri 2000 software ( Data Input , Darmstadt , Germany ) . Endpoints - The endpoint study identification cardiovascular risk metabolic complication factor represent risk population obesity WHO . Therefore , measure parameter metabolic syndrome , endothelial dysfunction subclinical atherosclerosis . Patients , give inform consent , follow conventional weight loss ( diet , activity ) bariatric surgery yearly . The decision type intervention connect complex process . According German obesity society subject 40 kg/m2 patient BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 obesity associate disease indication bariatric surgery . After draft expert 's opinion coverage cost health insurance patient may attend bariatric surgery . Because noncommittal character guideline German obesity society health insurance patient able get coverage surgery cost . Patients able get cost coverage refuse surgery represent conservative treatment ( activity , diet ) . The interventional group treat bariatric surgery ( sleeve gastrectomy , Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ) . Therefore , study observational character .</detailed_description>
