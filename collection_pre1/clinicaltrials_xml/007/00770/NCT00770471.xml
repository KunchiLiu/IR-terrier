	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : ABT-888 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving ABT-888 together radiation therapy temozolomide may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose ABT-888 give together radiation therapy temozolomide see well work treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ABT-888 administer combination radiotherapy temozolomide patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme . ( Phase I ) - To estimate overall survival patient treat ABT-888 administer MTD combination radiotherapy temozolomide . ( Phase II ) Secondary - To assess toxicity associate regimen . ( Phase I ) - To assess describe pharmacokinetics ABT-888 . ( Phase I ) - To estimate frequency toxicity associate regimen . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I dose-escalation study ABT-888 follow phase II study . - Initiation therapy : Patients receive oral ABT-888 twice daily ( day 1 ) oral temozolomide daily ( begin day 2 ) week 1-6 . Patients enrol phase I dose-escalation/phase II portion study also undergo concurrent radiotherapy daily 5 day week ( begin day 2 ) week 1-6 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Maintenance therapy : Beginning 4 week completion initiation therapy , patient receive oral ABT-888 twice daily day 1-7 oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course ( 6 course patient enrol phase I dose-escalation/phase II portion study ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic , pharmacogenetic , pharmacodynamic analysis . Samples analyzed concentration ABT-888 plasma reversed-phase isocratic high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ; identification novel marker treatment response plasma proteomic evaluation ; DNA methylation and/or mutation ; PARP inhibition ELISA . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
