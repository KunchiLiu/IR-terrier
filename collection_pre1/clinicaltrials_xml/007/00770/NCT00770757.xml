	<detailed_description>Chronic Graft v . Host Disease major complication allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation develop 30 - 70 % patient . It multisystem alloimmune autoimmune disorder negative impact quality life functional status , increase need extend immunosuppression lead cause late transplant relate mortality . CC-4047 novel immune modulatory drug thalidomide analog 4,000 fold great inhibition TNF-α production relate thalidomide . Several feature CC-4047 suggest drug may useful treat chronic GVHD include vitro suppression TNF-α production , increase Th1 stimulation IL-12 sIL-Rα . This study open-label , single-arm , pilot study efficacy safety CC-4047 patient advance chronic GvHD fail achieve response high-dose corticosteroid second line systemic immunosuppressive therapy .</detailed_description>
