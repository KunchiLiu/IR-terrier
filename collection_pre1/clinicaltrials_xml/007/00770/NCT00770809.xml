	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study paclitaxel trastuzumab without lapatinib see well work treat patient stage II stage III breast cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Lapatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving paclitaxel trastuzumab and/or lapatinib surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . It yet know regimen effective treat patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Trastuzumab With Without Lapatinib Treating Patients With Stage II Stage III Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine pathologic complete response ( pCR ) breast neoadjuvant weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab plus lapatinib ( THL ) 20 % great pCR weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab alone ( TH ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pathologic complete response breast axilla , use American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) Tumor , Lymph Nodes Metastasis ( TMN ) criterion ( version 6 ) , neoadjuvant weekly paclitaxel plus human epidermal growth factor 2 ( HER2 ) - target therapy patient HER2-positive operable breast cancer . II . To evaluate residual cancer burden ( RCB ) predictor long term relapse free survival ( RFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . III . To document toxicity chemotherapeutic regimen ( THL , TH ) . IV . To determine correlation clinical , radiographic pathologic response . V. To compare overall survival ( OS ) , relapse free survival ( RFS ) time first failure ( TFF ) among treatment group . VI . To obtain blood , fresh frozen fix tumor tissue test specific hypotheses biomarker data exist evaluate biomarkers blood , serum tissue likely influence response toxicity trastuzumab alone trastuzumab plus lapatinib , give paclitaxel . VII . To determine surgical practice pattern breast conservation sentinel lymphadenectomy patient undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy . VIII . To determine radiotherapy practice pattern post-mastectomy regional nodal irradiation patient undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy . IX . To evaluate pharmacogenomic determinant toxicity . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily 16 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive trastuzumab paclitaxel arm I . ARM III : Patients receive paclitaxel lapatinib ditosylate arm I . ( Discontinued 6-15-11 ) Within 42 day completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient arm undergo definitive surgery ( breast conservation total mastectomy ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
