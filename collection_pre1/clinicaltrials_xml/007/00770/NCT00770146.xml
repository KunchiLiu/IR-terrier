	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Mipomersen ( ISIS 301012 ) As Add-on Therapy High Risk Hypercholesterolemic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercholesterolemia characterize markedly elevate low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) . Elevated LDL major risk factor CHD . Mipomersen antisense drug reduces protein liver cell call apolipoprotein B ( apo-B ) . Apo-B plays role produce low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) ( `` bad '' cholesterol ) move liver one 's bloodstream . High LDL-C independent risk factor development CHD diseases blood vessel . It show lower LDL-C reduces risk heart attack major adverse cardiovascular event . The purpose study determine whether mipomersen safely effectively lower LDL-C patient high cholesterol high risk CHD already maximally tolerate dose statin . This study consist 26-week treatment period 24-week post-treatment follow-up period . Participants finish treatment discontinue prematurely study reason assess safety 24 week last study drug dose .</detailed_description>
