	<detailed_description>II . Background 1 . Description Problem One effect cardiac operation involve cardiopulmonary bypass reversible myocardial dysfunction last number day postoperatively . Typically period myocardial dysfunction treat vasoactive drug aim improve contractility reduce afterload . Problems exist current vasodilator therapy , include : variable response , inadequate response , complication delivery mechanism potential swing blood pressure ongoing dose adjustment . These necessary due patient ' autonomic nervous system reactivity change post-cardiopulmonary bypass period . Evidence support therapy target control systemic vascular resistance include randomize controlled study look outcome high risk neonate undergo open cardiac procedure high dose synthetic narcotic anesthesia . This know reduce sympathetic nervous system activity . There exist numerous , uncontrolled widely accept , study document adjunctive use vasodilator sodium nitroprusside , nitroglycerin alpha-adrenergic blocker include phenoxybenzamine perioperative period . The result study point towards salutatory effect measure control vasoconstrictor response blood flow organ risk , primarily organs splenic circulation : liver , kidney , intestine . Ischemia organs responsible significant amount morbidity post-bypass period include late onset sepsis renal dysfunction . In addition , myocardial injury natural vasoconstrictor response mammalian organism fall cardiac output counterproductive may initiate cascade response , necessitate medical intervention culminate overt myocardial pump failure . This lead patient death need institution extracorporeal circulatory support initial cardiopulmonary bypass period . 2 . Physiologic Role Phenoxybenzamine Numerous report demonstrate nearly complete blockage alpha-adrenergic receptor ( i.e . phenoxybenzamine ) infusion exogenous catecholamine neural release endogenous catecholamine result vasoconstrictor response instead augment myocardial contractility without increase afterload . While medical intervention effect circulatory response already use commonly perioperative period , include synthetic narcotic analgesia use short-acting vasodilator agent , measure alone universally effective prevent sort hemodynamic deterioration describe . Therefore , propose use phenoxybenzamine , drug irreversibly bind alpha-adrenergic receptor dopamine receptor , adjunct management perioperative vascular tone abnormality high risk infant child undergo cardiopulmonary bypass open heart procedure . 3 . Existing pharmacologic clinical data Phenoxybenzamine ( Dibenzyline : Wellspring Pharmaceutical Corporation , Bradenton , FL ) haloalkylamine irreversibly block α-1 α-2 adrenergic receptor . The drug exhibit slightly high affinity α-1 receptor . 12 There exist body literature concern intravenous administration phenoxybenzamine set congenital heart disease surgery , specifically Norwood repair hypoplastic leave heart syndrome . The use phenoxybenzamine cardiac surgery demonstrate facilitate higher pump flow rate cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) associate attenuation postoperative metabolic acidosis . 13 Specifically , phenoxybenzamine show effective sodium nitroprusside improve tissue perfusion postbypass ( demonstrated comparison rewarming characteristic ) , low base deficit patient treat phenoxybenzamine . 14 Indeed , date many congenital heart disease surgical center United States , prior Norwood procedure , administer 0.25 mg/kg phenoxybenzamine initiation cardiopulmonary bypass attempt optimize systemic organ perfusion perioperative period . Such protocol , dose specifically , describe improve systemic oxygen delivery patient undergo Norwood procedure hypoplastic leave heart syndrome , well improvement survival future surgical palliation . 10 III . Aims Objectives Our general hypothesis blockade vasoconstrictor response period around cardiopulmonary bypass result well organ preservation improvement cardiac output postoperatively . More specifically , serum lactate serf surrogate demonstrate adequacy end organ perfusion , utilize continuous variable primary endpoint purpose protocol . Our hypothesis use phenoxybenzamine select population reduce initial postoperative lactate level clinically-relevant level 25 % , relative historical control . Secondary endpoint evaluate well include utilization inotropic support , duration hospitalization , time resolution postoperative lactic acidosis . Both physiologic outcome variable examine compare matched cohort patient drawn recent experience without use phenoxybenzamine . IV . Patient Selection Clinical Management Patient selection determine assessment risk systemic ventricular dysfunction follow open cardiac repair population infant undergoing stage I palliation ( Norwood procedure ) diagnosis either hypoplastic leave heart syndrome similar left-sided obstructive lesion set single-ventricle physiology . Eligible neonates infant include age 0 day 6 month . These patient evaluate individual basis decision give phenoxybenzamine would determine attend surgeon , anesthesiologist , cardiologist . No change patient ' perioperative management occur . Efficacy assess evaluate need vasodilator inotropic agent , well evaluate effect alpha-blockade clinical course hemodynamics patient . Comparison match historical cohort patient receive drug perform . Likewise , historical cohort population include population include infant undergone Norwood procedure either hypoplastic leave heart syndrome similar univentricular lesion require aortic arch reconstruction . Aside importance meeting protocol inclusion criterion , specific criterion exclude subject V. Drug Administration Safety Monitoring Parenteral phenoxybenzamine require IND human administration , submit FDA pending ( see attach ) . The significant risk parenteral phenoxybenzamine excessive alpha-adrenergic blockade result diastolic hypotension . This problem treat intravenous adrenergic support form norepinephrine vasopressin . Precautions place use phenoxybenzamine include physician presence administration , invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring , inotropic agent available immediate use . This drug obtain WellSpring Pharmaceuticals store Investigational Drug Pharmacy . The drug administer operating room . After induction anesthesia pIacement appropriate cardiovascular monitoring line , initial load dose 0.25 mg/kg administer intravenously immediately prior cardiopulmonary bypass.For 72 hour postoperatively , 0.25 mg/kg/day administer Based publish pharmacokinetic data dos block 90 -95 % alpha-peripheral receptor half life 24 - 36 hour regeneration . This period time correspond nicely period high hemodynamic vulnerability patient population . No alteration usual perioperative monitoring occur solely allow drug administration . Monitoring anesthesia , preload , afterload , contractility , cardiac output maintain throughout period administration recovery way present , perform patient population : invasive transthoracic cardiac line , echocardiography , venous systemic oximetry , analysis acid/base abnormality . Secondary end-organ function monitor include kidney ( urine output , creatinine , ) brain ( cerebral oximetry ) . Potential toxicity drug relate effect excessive vasodilatation . Subjects monitor toxicity frequent physical examination well continuous blood pressure monitor immediate postoperative period . The ultimate rescue therapy excessive vasodilation hypotension would institution high flow extracorporeal circulation , would position provide timely fashion operate room intensive care unit . Pharmacologic management counteract adverse effect alpha-adrenergic blockade would norepinephrine , administer dose 0.01-0.05 mcglkglmin . Epinephrine may relatively contraindicated set beta-adrenergic receptor leave unopposed . Therefore , drug stimulate type receptor ( e.g. , epinephrine ) may produce exaggerated hypotensive response tachycardia . Those subject experience hypotension refractory conventional postoperative management , experience end-organ dysfunction relate hypotension , require norepinephrine reversal previous dose phenoxybenzamine would strongly consider withdrawal study . Adverse reaction report oral administration include nasal congestion , mycosis , tachycardia , drowsiness fatigue . This drug FDA approve oral administration treatment pheochromocytoma control episodes hypertension sweat . It also show efficacy micturition disorder result neurogenic bladder , functional outlet obstruction partial prosthetic obstruction . Subjects follow throughout hospital course time discharge home . There follow ask subject relate study . Historical cohort analysis include analysis clinically-relevant endpoint note , well laboratory value vital sign perioperative period time discharge home . A three-physician panel , comprise involve operative postoperative care particular patient population ( investigator study ) appoint review subject case . The panel meet 5-subject interval review data safety profile case . VI . Data Storage , Acquisition , Analysis An electronic database , password-protected available PI co-investigators utilized purpose data analysis . A copy data acquisition form accompany application . The data destroy 5 year follow completion study analysis result data . Data acquire study store password-protected database . Only PI co-investigators access password database . Upon identification eligible historical cohort , chart review pertinent data enter above-described database . The data historical cohort de-identified attempt maintain confidentiality . Subject ID number historical cohort group assign differentiate subject purpose data analysis , specifically identify subject . Data analysis include several clinically-relevant endpoint , include overall surgical mortality ( survival discharge ) , time initial extubation cessation mechanical ventilation , length hospital stay . End-organ function status post cardiopulmonary bypass assess evaluate lab value currently study , include serum lactate . Monitoring hemodynamic value include blood pressure leave atrial pressure utilize indirectly assess cardiac output . Other end organ evaluate include kidney ( urine output test renal function creatinine ) brain ( clinical evaluation test order indicated , well cerebral oximetry ) . We also evaluate need inotropic and/or vasodilator support ( dose duration ) . The study require additional lab radiology test base patient inclusion . Data review historical cohort include specify data collection sheet , namely above-described clinically-relevant endpoint , well laboratory value ( serum lactate , serum creatinine ) , vital sign ( blood pressure , cerebral oximetry , leave atrial pressure ) , evidence end organ perfusion ( urine output ) , postoperative inotrope requirement . As serum lactate serf surrogate demonstrate adequacy end organ perfusion , utilize continuous variable primary endpoint purpose protocol . Our hypothesis use phenoxybenzamine select population reduce initial postoperative lactate level clinically-relevant level 25 % , relative historical control . Secondary endpoint evaluate well include utilization inotropic support , duration mechanical ventilation overall hospitalization , time resolution postoperative lactic acidosis . Recent experience Norwood procedure , conventional palliative surgical therapy hypoplastic leave heart syndrome , demonstrate mean initial serum lactate 7.3 ± 3.3 mmol/L 21 neonate . 15 Assuming clinically significant reduction 25 % 5.5 mmol/L ( 80 % power assume p ≤ 0.05 demonstrate statistical significance ) , one would require total 54 study subject . Given anticipated surgical volume approximately 20 Norwood procedure annually , along 15 % dropout refusal rate , would expect accrue total required volume 62 subject approximately 3 year . We also compare data data already exist within cardiac registry evaluation . VII .
