	<brief_title>Efficacy Pioglitazone Metformin Cardiovascular Risk Subjects With Insulin-Treated Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It establish matrix metalloproteinases play essential role degradation collagen extra cellular matrix macromolecule . In addition , matrix metalloproteinases implicate plaque rupture capacity thin protective cap plaque , thus render vulnerable . In fact , matrix metalloproteinase-9 level elevate patient unstable plaque patient acute coronary syndrome . In patient type 2 diabetes mellitus , matrix metalloproteinase-1 matrix metalloproteinase-9 level usually elevate atherosclerotic plaque vulnerable compare non-diabetic patient , confirm role proteinase development acute coronary syndrome . Therefore , therapeutic strategy reduce blood glucose level attenuate inflammation matrix metalloproteinases activity may tool reduce cardiovascular risk patient diabetes . The purpose trial investigate whether anti-inflammatory effect pioglitazone maintain sustain long observation period give combination insulin comparison metformin plus insulin combination . The duration treatment patient complete study approximately 6 month .</detailed_description>
