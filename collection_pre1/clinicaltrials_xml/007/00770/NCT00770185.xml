	<brief_title>Ridaforolimus Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic and/or Locally Advanced Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess efficacy , term objective response rate , ridaforolimus , patient recurrent metastatic and/or locally advanced endometrial cancer . - To assess adverse event , time progression , response duration drug patient . - To correlate objective tumor response PTEN expression potential marker primary tumor tissue patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral ridaforolimus daily day 1-5 4 week . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Archived tumor tissue sample ( paraffin block unstained slide ) analyze PTEN gene expression mTOR pathway element explore possible marker response non-progression immunohistochemistry . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
