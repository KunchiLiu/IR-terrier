	<detailed_description>Diabetes one common chronic disease worldwide , affect nearly 200 million people , almost suffer Type 2 Diabetes . It fourth lead cause death developed country due negative impact disease cardiovascular system . Treatment , aim reduction intrinsic cardiovascular risk , base tight control glucose coexist metabolic abnormality well biomarkers inflammation atherogenesis . Macrovascular complication account vast majority morbidity mortality diabetic patient , grow evidence pathophysiologic mechanism hyperglycemia responsible . The condition vascular endothelium particular show effect health disease cardiovascular system . The number function endothelial progenitor cell correlate inversely cardiovascular risk factor may surrogate biologic marker vascular function cumulative cardiovascular risk . Pioglitazone orally active thiazolidinedione derivative .
