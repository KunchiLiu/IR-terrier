	<brief_summary>In study , compare cue-reactivity smoker without schizophrenia influence smoking cue respond cigarette puff PR schedule reinforcement . Given high prevalence smoking among individual schizophrenia , understanding environmental factor serve maintain nicotine dependence critical step improve smoke cessation treatment outcome . Establishing validate laboratory model cue-elicited responsivity cigarette self- administration allow investigation efficacy anti-craving medication people schizophrenia . Specific Aims 1 ) To compare effect smoke versus neutral cue crave , mood , autonomic responsivity smoker schizophrenia smoker without schizophrenia . 2 ) To compare effect smoke versus neutral cue reinforce efficacy tobacco cigarettes smoker schizophrenia smoker without schizophrenia . Outcome Measures During cue trial , primary measure include crave ( TCQ-SF , VAS ) , mood ( mood form , VAS ) , autonomic ( heart rate , blood pressure , skin conductance temperature ) responsivity . During self-administration trial , primary measure include breakpoint ( final ratio complete ) , total number response , number cigarette puff earn take . Secondary measure include baseline smoke history , mood form , TCQ-SF , CO , FTND , urinary cotinine 3-hydroxycotinine ( 3-HC ) . The ratio 3-HC/cotinine phenotypic biomarker rate nicotine metabolism , show associated level nicotine dependence , various smoke behavior , treatment outcome ( Ho &amp; Tyndale , 2007 ) . We correlate primary measure 3-HC/cotinine ratio explore possible relationship future study .</brief_summary>
