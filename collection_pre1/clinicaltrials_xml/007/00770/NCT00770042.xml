	<detailed_description>Rationale : Erectile dysfunction ( ED ) persistent recurrent inability attain maintain penile erection sufficient permit satisfactory sexual performance . The current first-line treatment ED consist oral therapy phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE5 ) inhibitor . These drug prevents hydrolysis cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) , result increased level cGMP decrease Ca+2 concentration smooth muscle cell erectile tissue , smooth muscle relaxation increase blood flow penis . The drug extensively metabolize human liver microsome , involve cytochrome P450 , CYP2C subfamily CYP3A4 . This enzyme system readily inhibit many drug . When enzyme metabolize PDE5 inhibitor inhibit , may increase plasma concentration drug possible increase prolongation therapeutic and/or adverse effect . Avanafil potent highly specific PDE5 inhibitor rapidly absorb gastrointestinal tract relatively short half-life ( 0.55-1.2 hour ) . The formation main metabolite avanafil catalyze CYP3A4 . It possible pharmacokinetics avanafil may modify drug block cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway , result significant change pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , efficacy adverse event profile . This study conduct examine effect three CYP3A4 inhibitor ( ketoconazole , erythromycin ritonavir ) single dose pharmacokinetics avanafil . Ketoconazole ritonavir potent inhibitor CYP3A4 erythromycin moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor . Any interaction observe would predictive inhibitor CYP3A4</detailed_description>
