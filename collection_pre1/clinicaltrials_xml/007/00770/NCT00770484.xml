	<brief_summary>The main limitation patient orthostatic intolerance ( OI , postural tachycardia syndrome , POTS ) exercise related increase heart rate standing . Main pharmacological treatment today aim reduce heart rate use betablockers ( propanolol ) , theoretically could also improve exercise capacity ; heart rate increase much medication , could exercise . In addition , suggest healthy volunteer subject head tilt 2 week ( situation produce `` simulated '' transient POTS-like state ) single bout intense exercise improve orthostatic tolerance day exercise . The mechanism involve response clear could increase plasma volume already diminished POTS patient . It seem likely could true POTS patient . The purpose present study pharmacologically improve amount exercise POTS patient perform reduce baseline heart rate ( specific aim 1 ) evaluate next day heart responses acute bout intense exercise . Therefore , specific aim study : 1 . To test hypothesis lower heart rate response propanolol result increase exercise capacity . 2 . To test hypothesis single bout exercise result improvement orthostatic tolerance day exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Subjects study twice , receive placebo second occasion receive propanolol . - An exercise capacity test estimation maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2 max ) do within 1 hour receiving pill contain placebo appearance identical one propanolol . This test conduct stationary bicycle effort gradually increase expired air measure exhaustive physical work . The test last approximately 30 minute conduct Vanderbilt 's Clinical Trial Center . - The day day exercise test subject ask collect urine 12 hour time keep record much liquid ingest . - Posture study test ( measurement heart rate blood pressure take lie interval 30 minute stand ) do day day exercise test .</detailed_description>
