	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Pioglitazone Ramipril Combination Therapy Treating Non-diabetic Hypertensive Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients insulin resistance activate inflammation prone cardiovascular complication like myocardial infarction stroke . Pharmacological intervention reduce vascular inflammation think reduce cardiovascular risk diabetic non-diabetic patient . Intervention ACE inhibitor like ramipril establish widely use treatment patient high blood pressure , proven reduce cardiovascular risk . Treatment non-diabetic patient pioglitazone show improve cardiovascular risk profile non-diabetic patient beyond effect blood glucose level . The purpose study evaluate effect low grade inflammation vascular function pioglitazone non-diabetic , hypertensive patient pre treatment angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( replace study medication time randomization ) .</detailed_description>
