	<brief_title>S0722 : Everolimus Treating Patients With Pleural Malignant Mesothelioma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine 4-month progression-free survival patient unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma treat everolimus . Secondary - To determine response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) disease control rate ( response stable disease ) patient measurable disease RECIST modify RECIST criterion . - To determine overall survival patient . - To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate treatment regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
