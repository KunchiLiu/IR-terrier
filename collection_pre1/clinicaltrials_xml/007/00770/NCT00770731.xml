	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose Torisel ( temsirolimus ) , Hycamtin ( topotecan hydrochloride ) , Velcade ( bortezomib ) give , combination , patient advance cancer spread unable surgically remove . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Temsirolimus , Topotecan , Bortezomib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Temsirolimus design block pathway control important event growth blood vessel vital growth cancer . This may cause cancer cell die . Topotecan hydrochloride design block function important protein cancer cell . These protein , active , allow cell 's gene duplicate cancer cell divide . Bortezomib design block function important protein cancer cell . These protein control destruction protein tumor cell , important growth . This may cause cancer cell die . Study Drug Dose Level : If find eligible take part study , enrol group 3-6 participant receive drug combination . The first group participant receive low dose drug combination . The next group participant receive next high dose drug combination . The third group receive even high dose . This process continue study doctor find high safe dose drug combination . The dose receive depend enrol study safety data available time . The dose receive may lower tolerate study drug combination well . You receive dos study drug high dose first assign . Once high tolerate dose find , 10 participant add dose level . This called Expansion Group . Study Drug Administration : Temsirolimus , topotecan , bortezomib give `` cycle . '' Cycles 21 day long longer , depend side effect may experience . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle , receive temsirolimus needle vein 30-60 minute . On Days 1 8 cycle , receive topotecan hydrochloride vein 30-60 minute . On Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 cycle , receive bortezomib vein le 1 minute . While study able take drug may interfere study drug . You talk doctor take non-study drug . Study Visits : Once week Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - If doctor think need , urine collect routine test . If Expansion Group , Week 3 Cycle 1 , tumor biopsy compare activity tumor treatment treatment begin . This do research purpose . If Expansion Group , 24-48 hour start Week 1 Cycle 1 , bone marrow aspiration perform . The tissue use see study drug combination act body learn effect may cancer cell . This do research purpose . During Week 1 Cycle 2 , ECG . After , extra ECGs doctor think need . During Week 1 Cycles 2 beyond , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - If doctor think need , urine may collect routine test . Once every 2 cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) , CT MRI scan check status disease . FDG-PET Scans : Every 2-3 month study Cycle 1 FDG-PET within last 1 month , may FDG-PET scan . You must fast least 6 hour FDG-PET scan . If diabetic , must fast least 4 hour FDG-PET scan . If need , may take drug drink water . The FDG-PET use see activity cancer decrease drug . You receive small amount FDG solution vein . You rest quiet darkened room 45-60 minute PET scan . Pictures body take use PET scanner , take 1 1/2 hour . The entire procedure take 3 hour . Each time FDG-PET scan , blood ( either finger stick 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure blood sugar level . Length Study Participation : You study long benefiting . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Treatment Visit : After study , end-of-treatment visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Temsirolimus , topotecan , bortezomib FDA approve commercially available . Temsirolimus FDA approve treatment renal cell cancer . Topotecan hydrochloride FDA approve treatment ovarian , small cell lung , cervical cancer . Bortezomib FDA approve treatment multiple myeloma mantle cell lymphoma . The use drug together investigational authorize use research . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
