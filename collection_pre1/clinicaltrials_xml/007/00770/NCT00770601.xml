	<brief_summary>This study examine whether medicine call canakinumab safe effective treating patient neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease ( NOMID ) , also know chronic infantile neurologic , cutaneous , articular ( CINCA ) syndrome . This disease cause rash , joint deformity , brain inflammation , problem eye learn difficulty . Canakinumab experimental drug inhibits action protein produce body call interleukin 1 , responsible symptom NOMID also contribute many kind inflammatory disease . Patients 2 year age old NOMID may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Screening Phase - Medical history review medical record - Blood test - Daily diary symptom medicine take Washout/Lead-in Phase - Discontinuation anakinra medication Treatment Phase - Injection canakinumab skin every 8 week 6 month - Monitoring evaluation treatment , include : - Quality-of-life questionnaire daily diary - Vital sign measurement ( heartbeat , blood pressure , temperature ) - Blood test - Electrocardiogram - Tuberculosis skin test - Neurological , eye skin examination begin end study - Cognitive evaluation begin end study - Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) beginning study , 2 week second dose canakinumab end study - X-rays bone density scan begin end study - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) head begin end study Follow-up Phase - Monthly clinic visit last dose canakinumab minimum 60 day End-of-Study Evaluation - Series test 8 week last dose canakinumab evaluate treatment response side effect</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label study design investigate safety , tolerability , efficacy , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics canakinumab , fully human anti-interleukin-1beta ( anti-IL-1beta ) monoclonal antibody , patient NOMID / CINCA syndrome . A total 25 30 patient enrol study . The study consist two stage : In first pilot stage plan enroll 5 patient undergoing PK/PD assessment blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , monitor efficacy ( CNS relapse inflammatory relapse ) confirm dose dose regimen enlarge number patient enrol study . Up 5 additional patient may enrol stage variability responses treatment high . Interim analyse conduct required . Following Stage 1 , second confirmatory stage conduct , enrol 20 additional patient . In stage patient treat dose dose regimen base assessment efficacy profile Stage 1 exploratory PK/PD assessment . In stage 3-week screening period collect pre-treatment parameter , run-in period ( patient discontinue anakinra ) , baseline evaluation prior drug administration , 24-week treatment period fix dose canakinumab , study completion visit . Patients whose body weight great 40 kg receive canakinumab 150 mg subcutaneous ( s.c. ) injection , patient body weight less equal 40 kg receive canakinumab 2 mg/kg s.c . Patients administer canakinumab every 8 week undergo observation period dose administration order evaluate response treatment . Patients achieve complete remission follow canakinumab injection treatment period re-dosed within Day 15 receive follow dose adjustment : - 300 mg s.c. ( 4 mg/kg patient body weight less equal 40 kg ) - 450 mg s.c. ( 6 mg/kg patient body weight less equal 40 kg ) - 600 mg s.c. ( 8 mg/kg patient body weight less equal 40 kg ) End Study occur patient discontinue study complete study . The End Study visit occur 8 week ( plus minus 1 week ) last injection . All patient complete 6-month evaluation may offer enter extension study ( CACZ885D2201E1 ) conduct assess long term safety efficacy data .</detailed_description>
