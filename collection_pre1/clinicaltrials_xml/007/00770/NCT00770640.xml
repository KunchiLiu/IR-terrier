	<brief_title>Efficacy Pioglitazone Insulin Treating Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Renal Failure .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients type 2 diabetes mellitus clinically significant kidney disease present contra-indications metformin sulfonylurea drug usually treat insulin therapy . While prolonged pharmacokinetic insulin profile due delay renal insulin elimination already hurdle successful therapy , impaired kidney function result increase oxidative stress cardiovascular risk , especially patient require dialysis . Several potential mechanism may explain increase cardiovascular risk , one , frequent find coexistence several independent cardiovascular risk factor include dyslipidemia , hypertension smoking . In addition , impaired kidney function associate elevated marker inflammation putative risk factor cardiovascular event . The focus study investigate whether pioglitazone may help improve overall metabolic cardiovascular risk patient end stage renal disease , pioglitazone potentially exert positive effect kidney function patient renal failure require dialysis . The duration treatment patient complete study approximately 26 week .</detailed_description>
