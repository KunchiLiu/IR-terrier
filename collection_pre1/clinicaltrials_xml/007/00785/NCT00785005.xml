	<brief_summary>Given sedentary behavior associate T2DM , purpose study evaluate whether subject T2DM significant disincentive performing exercise ( due great perceived effort ) . This study prospectively compare perceived exercise effort T2DM non-diabetic woman adjust potential confounders include baseline physical activity . This study also assess whether perception effort associate physiologic parameter related exercise effort . Finally , 3 hypothesis-generating exploratory aim design screen additional psychological physiologic parameter may increase perceived effort T2DM . Hypothesis 1 : At absolute workload ( e.g. , 30 watt ) relative workload , great effort woman T2DM exercise non-diabetic woman . Specific Aim 1 : To determine difference subjective perceive effort bicycle exercise low-to-moderate workload sedentary woman Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) vs. non-diabetic sedentary woman . Hypothesis 2 : There significant association RPE physiologic measure related work intensity ( e.g. , relative work intensity tau2 ) . Specific Aim 2 : In population SA1 , determine strength association bicycle exercise subjective perceive effort physiologic measure related work intensity . Exploratory Aims : Exploratory Aim 1 : In T2DM group describe SA1 , determine strength association bicycle exercise subjective effort additional physiologic measure Exploratory Aim 2 : In T2DM group describe SA1 , determine strength association bicycle exercise subjective effort psychologic measure related perception effort .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Sedentary woman participate regular exercise program ( &gt; one bout exercise per week ) If subject diabetes , must uncomplicated T2DM &lt; 25 year since T2DM diagnosis Ages 5070 year BMI 2535 Subjects take follow oral hypoglycemic drug : metformin , sulfonylureas sitagliptin . Use insulin oral hypoglycemic medication allow . Persons T2DM accept study total glycosylated hemoglobin level ( HbA1C ) &lt; 8 % ( adequate control ) therapy . Control subject must HbA1C &lt; 5.5 % fast blood glucose &lt; 100 mg/dl suggest significant insulin resistance . All woman must postmenopausal , document menstrual history follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level . Current smoker exclude since smoke impair CV exercise performance people quit smoke least 1 year accept study . Absence comorbid condition confirm history , physical examination laboratory test . In general , people exclude condition could limit exercise performance . Persons clinically evident distal symmetrical neuropathy , determine evaluation symptom ( numbness , paresthesia ) sign ( elicit vibration , pinprick , light touch , ankle jerk ) , exclude study neuropathy may limit exercise performance . Persons autonomic dysfunction ( &gt; 20 mm fall upright BP without change heart rate ) exclude well , due associate limitation exercise performance . Persons exclude evidence heart disease history ( Prior heart attack bypass surgery , heart failure , significant valvular disease ) abnormal rest electrocardiogram ( EKG ) consistent prior infarct latent ischemia ( unless cardiovascular stress image catheterization show coronary artery disease ) . We also exclude subject leave right bundle branch block rest EKG ( precludes recognition ischemic EKG change exercise ) abnormal exercise EKG ( &gt; 1 mm ST segment depression 80 msec ST segment 3 consecutive beat ) . Persons angina exerciselimiting cardiovascular , pulmonary musculoskeletal symptom exclude well . Presence systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 rest &gt; 250 exercise diastolic pressure &gt; 95 rest &gt; 105 exercise also ground exclusion . Subjects proteinuria ( urine protein &gt; 200 mg/dl ) creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl , suggestive renal disease exclude . Subjects total cholesterol &gt; 220 mg/dl , low density lipoprotein &gt; 130 mg/dl , triglycerides &gt; 250 mg/dl exclude give potential insulin resistance endothelial dysfunction associate cholesterol parameter . Subjects take follow medication exclude : insulin , oral hypoglycemic agent state inclusion criterion , estrogencontaining hormone replacement therapy include `` estring '' . Control subject immediate family member type 2 diabetes exclude .</criteria>
