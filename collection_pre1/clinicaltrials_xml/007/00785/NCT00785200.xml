	<brief_summary>The goal 3-year project control spread community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( CA-MRSA ) Dallas County Jail . CA-MRSA bacterium spread rapidly healthy population become epidemic many region U.S . Many people community asymptomatically colonize MRSA . There outbreaks MRSA infection prison jail . We study spread MRSA jail well understand bacteria transmit person person prevent transmission . All detainee ask participate must give informed consent ; privacy carefully protect . Detainees history allergy CHG exclude . Seventeen object jail sample contamination MRSA . Bacteria collect culture obtain patient bacterial skin infection 18 month part jail order determine frequently infection cause MRSA relative bacteria . A group 1500 adult detainee test colonization MRSA order determine commonly detainees carry bacterium . A cluster-randomized 6-month study undertaken among detainee take place leave jail determine chlorhexidine ( CHG ) -containing disposable wash cloth skin clean decrease prevalence MRSA skin nose colonization . Detainees receive CHG cloth ( 500 detainee ) compare detainee receive water-soaked cloth skin cleaning ( 500 detainee ) intervention ( 500 detainee ) . The primary outcome difference average colonization prevalence detention tank , discrete detention unit housing detainee , compare usual care CHG-exposed tank 6 month CHG cloth use . A secondary outcome decrease skin infection cause tank receive CHG compare usual care . All MRSA isolate sample S. aureus isolate susceptible methicillin specimen colonize infect detainee , well contaminate surface object jail test genetically order determine strain MRSA present jail . This study may identify way stop spread MRSA among people jail prison , well place .</brief_summary>
