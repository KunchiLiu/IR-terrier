	<brief_summary>Excessive inflammation associate tissue damage cause over-activation innate immune system . This range mild disease extreme condition multiple organ failure ( MOF ) . In marked contrast adaptive immunity sensitive immune modulators steroid , innate immune system sufficiently target currently available anti-inflammatory drug . We hypothesize C1-esterase inhibitor modulate innate immune response . In study , human endotoxemia use model inflammation . Subjects , additionally endotoxin , receive C1 esterase inhibitor placebo . Blood sample determine level marker innate immune response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vivo Effects C1-esterase Inhibitor Innate Immune Response During Human Endotoxemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : There unmet need novel therapeutic agent focus complication cause acute excessive activation innate immune response injury . As activation respond poorly currently use therapy include inhaled steroid novel agent need test , develop apply . C1INH comprise potential important target drug antagonism excessive activation innate immune response acute inflammation see injury . This might achieve inhibit redistribution home cell inflammatory tissue . Before go clinical trial injure human subject want perform pilot study healthy volunteer exploit `` human endotoxemia model '' . The human endotoxemia model permit elucidation key player pro-inflammatory response human vivo , therefore serve useful tool investigate potential novel therapeutic strategy standardize set . The model bear strike resemblance LPS model animal . These latter study show C1INH protect neutrophil mediate disease [ 1-4 ] . Together find C1INH show safe treatment human , propose use protein treatment neutrophil drive acute inflammation see injury . Objectives : Primary objective : The primary objective study determine effect C1INH systemic activation innate immune response induce LPS challenge . This response objectivised measurement enhance TNF-Î± level 90 min LPS challenge . Secondary Objective ( ) : The secondary objective study determine effect C1INH redistribution neutrophil human endotoxemia model . Study design : Double-blind placebo-controlled randomize intervention study healthy human volunteer experimental endotoxemia . Study population : Non-smoking healthy male volunteer , age 18-35 yr Intervention : Subjects receive C1INH dose 100 U/kg ( n=10 ) placebo ( n=10 ) 30 min LPS administration . Pre-hydration perform infusion 1.5 L 2.5 % glucose/0.45 % saline solution 1 hour LPS administration . LPS derive E coli O:113 inject ( 2 ng/kg iv. , infusion rate 1 minute ) . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter concentration circulate cytokine LPS absence presence C1INH . Secondary study parameter include influence C1INH redistribution pattern neutrophil neutrophil phenotype .</detailed_description>
