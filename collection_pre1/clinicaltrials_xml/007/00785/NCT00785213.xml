	<detailed_description>Rosiglitazone predominantly metabolize cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2C8 . Quinine sulfate inhibitor CYP 2C8 . This study evaluate effect multiple dos quinine sulfate steady-state pharmacokinetics single-dose rosiglitazone healthy adult subject . On study Day 1 fast least 10 hour , twenty four healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , non-pregnant adult volunteer age 18 45 give one oral dose rosiglitazone ( 1 x 4 mg tablet ) . Fasting continue 4 hour dose . Blood sample draw participant dose 24 hour post-dose time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics rosiglitazone . A 2 day washout period complete first dose rosiglitazone Day 1 . On Days 4-7 subject receive dose quinine sulfate ( 2 x 324 mg capsule ) every 8 hour start 7:15 a.m. dose Day 4 continue 11:15 p.m. dose Day 7 . Doses quinine sulfate Days 4-6 administer without regard meal . On morning Day 7 overnight fast least 10 hour , study participant receive co-administered dos rosiglitazone ( 1 x 4 mg tablet ) quinine sulfate ( 2 x 324 mg capsule ) . Fasting continue 4 hour dose . Blood sample draw participant dose 24 hour post-dose time sufficient adequately determine pharmacokinetics rosiglitazone . A goal study evaluate safety tolerability regimen healthy volunteer . Subjects monitor throughout participation study adverse reaction study drug and/or procedure . Blood pressure ( sit least 3 minute ) pulse measure prior dose 1 , 2 3 hour morning dose rosiglitazone Days 1 7 . Electrocardiograms ( EKG ) record Day 4 dose quinine sulfate 1 , 2 4 hour post-dose Day 7 co-administered dos rosiglitazone quinine sulfate 1 , 2 4 hour post-dose . All adverse event whether elicited query , spontaneously report , observe clinic staff evaluate investigator report subject 's case report form .</detailed_description>
