	<brief_summary>The primary aim study obtain measure amino-terminal telopeptides procollagen 1 ( P1NP ) , marker bone formation , lactate non-lactating post-partum African-American woman 6-8 12-14 week post-partum , compare value normal control . The secondary aim obtain time point , measurement Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein ( PTHrP ) , additional marker bone turnover [ e.g . N-telopeptide collagen cross-link ( NTx ) , C-telopeptide collagen cross-link ( Ctx ) , bone specific alkaline phosphatase ( BSAP ) osteocalcin ( OC ) ] , calcium vitamin D metabolism subject . These result compare non-African-American cohort post-partum woman normal control . The investigator hypothesize African-American lactating woman increase bone turnover compare non-lactating postpartum woman normal control .

	<detailed_description>Pregnancy lactation state alter maternal calcium bone metabolism may significant impact development peak bone mass . While two state characterize different hormonal environment , associate significant bone loss . The maternal hormonal mechanism provide calcium meet need develop fetus appear different meet need lactation . During pregnancy , 30 gm calcium require fetus come predominantly increase maternal intestinal calcium absorption mediate 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D factor . Several study measure total free 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D pregnancy find value nearly double . Serum Parathyroid Hormone ( PTH ) level fall 10-30 % mean non-pregnant value first trim increase mid-normal range term , ionized calcium remain normal throughout pregnancy . Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein ( PTHrP ) level gradually increase throughout pregnancy although source ( maternal , fetal , placental ) remain unclear . Most study bone metabolism human pregnancy measure change marker bone turnover rather bone density avoid radiation exposure fetus . These study confound several variable effect hemodilution pregnancy , alter glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , degradation clearance marker placenta , may cloud result . Some study report increase urinary marker bone resorption early mid pregnancy bone formation marker decrease rise term . Importantly , one assess state-of-the-art marker bone formation type 1 Procollagen N-terminal Propeptide ( P1NP ) pregnancy lactation . During lactation human , estimate 600 1000 ml milk produce day daily calcium loss 200 400 mg . In contrast pregnancy , majority calcium come demineralization maternal skeleton , probably predominately mediate PTHrP set low estrogen . PTHrP level significantly high lactate woman non-lactating control intact PTH reduce approximately 50 % first several month lactation . The source PTHrP likely mammary gland , PTHrP level elevate 10,000 fold milk circulate maternal PTHrP level increase suckle . This also support mouse model tissue-specific ablation PTHrP gene lactate mammary gland result decrease bone loss lactation . When PTHrP enter maternal circulation , stimulate maternal bone resorption skeleton renal tubular resorption calcium . PTHrP indirectly suppress PTH ionized calcium rise upper level normal . 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D level fall within normal range lactation , although report high lactate non-lactating postpartum woman . Intestinal absorption calcium also return normal post-partum period . Serial bone density measurement ( BMD ) obtain lactation show fall 3-10 % trabecular bone ( spine , hip , femur ) small 1-2 % loss cortical bone . Both loss far great see early postmenopausal woman , woman receive gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) agonist therapy . This imply fall estrogen mediates bone loss lactation . The bone loss lactation seem transient rapid recovery bone density postpartum woman wean resumption menses . Markers bone resorption measure urine several prospective study lactation human report elevated 2-3 fold . However , result may confound decrease GFR volume contraction may occur lactation compare pregnancy . Surprisingly , reliable marker bone resorption measure serum ( CTX NTX ) measure control lactation study . Markers bone formation measure osteocalcin ( Oc ) bone specific alkaline phosphatase ( BSAP ) generally report high lactation . However , result difficult interpret BSAP sensitive marker bone formation . Recent data emerge suggest Oc may measure bone resorption well formation . The current accurate measure bone formation serum amino-terminal telopeptides procollagen 1 ( P1NP ) , recently measure control study lactate woman . We currently analyze data control study lactation Caucasian , Hispanic , Asian woman . Most study bone metabolism pregnancy lactation perform Caucasian female . Most study exclude African-Americans due unique difference bone metabolism know occur population may create wider statistical variation study result . It well establish bone metabolism African American subject differs Caucasians several aspect . The mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level low African-Americans primarily due reduce vitamin D production skin associate increased pigmentation well reduce intake vitamin D. As consequence , African-Americans relative secondary hyperparathyroidism resultant high level PTH , 1 , 25 dihydroxyvitamin D , low urinary calcium excretion . One would expect patient secondary hyperparathyroidism would result increase bone turnover decrease bone mass . This observed African Americans though . African Americans high bone density lower fracture risk compare Caucasians . Moreover , biochemical marker bone turnover African-Americans general low Caucasians , particularly bone formation , measure osteocalcin . On hand , normal increase renal absorption calcium . Based , Dr. Normal Bell propose black skeleton resistant effect PTH , renal sensitivity maintain even enhance . This hypothesis support observation significantly low bone resorption ( measure cross-linked N-telopeptide procollagen I ( NTx ) , cross-linked C-telopeptide type I collagen ( CTx ) , free deoxypyridinoline ( DPD ) normal low renal excretion calcium response PTH infusion African American compare Caucasian woman . This prospective cohort study post-partum lactating , non-lactating , healthy control African-American woman currently recently pregnant . The investigator hope estimate measurable difference bone formation resorption compare blood urine sample African-American lactating woman African-American non-lactating postpartum woman normal control . 100 female volunteer age 21-45 year recruit achieve 75 evaluable subject 25 three group . There two out-patient visit , 6-8 week apart . The visit take place University Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC ) - Clinical &amp; Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) locate 6 North East ( 6 NE ) Montefiore Hospital . The post-partum subject recruit last trim pregnancy 6-week post-partum visit . Healthy control recruit match breast-feeding postpartum woman already complete study . Visit 1 postpartum woman take place 6-8 week delivery Visit 2 14 week delivery . Healthy control subject two study visit similar interval match breast-feeding subject ( 1.5 2 month ) . For subject , inform consent obtain first visit , study procedure do : include medical history measurement vital sign , intake history menstrual cycle , pregnancy , applicable , delivery breast bottle feed event . Subjects complete dietary calcium intake questionnaire . Blood collection obtain visit measurement follow : serum ionized total calcium , phosphorus , creatinine , albumin , PTH ( 1-34 ) , PTH ( 1-84 ) , PTHrP ( 1-36 ) , 25-hydroxy Vitamin D High Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ) , include D2 D3 , 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D , estrogen status , Luteinizing Hormone ( LH ) , Follicle-stimulating Hormone ( FSH ) , Estradiol , marker bone metabolism ( e.g . NTX , CTX , P1NP , Osteocalcin ( OC ) , BSAP , Insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) , select cytokine interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . Urine sample obtain calcium , creatinine phosphorus . A urine pregnancy test do visit normal control . Post-partum woman urine pregnancy check Visit 2 , avoid false positive likely Visit 1 due recently complete pregnancy . Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) check Visit 1 exclude woman significant alteration thyroid function could interfere bone metabolism .</detailed_description>
