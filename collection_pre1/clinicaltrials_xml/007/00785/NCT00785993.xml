	<brief_summary>Egg-banking would considerably simplify logistics mean oocyte could donate . These bank would make easy immediately provide oocyte would compatible recipient , shorten even eliminate problem long wait list . Egg-banking would also allow oocyte effectively quarantine , drastically diminish risk transmission infectious disease fashion analogous semen bank . The essential prerequisite successful egg cryo-banking program efficient oocyte cryopreservation technology . Recent study , include experience , indicate vitrified oocyte preserve intact potential fertilize develop competent embryo , give high clinical result well high survival rate . The aim study evaluate impact establishment egg-banking ovum donation program . Oocyte cryopreservation carry Cryotop method . The study include oocyte donation cycle conduct fresh vitrified oocyte . Recipients allocate randomly group ( `` fresh vs. vitrify cycle '' ) . Main outcome measure include survival , fertilization , embryo development clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
