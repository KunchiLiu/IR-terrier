	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Histological cytological confirm diagnosis solid tumor . In dose escalation phase , tumor must unresectable locally advanced , metastatic , either proven effective therapy exist patient tolerate therapy . Patients enrol expanded MTD phase study must either HCC another select tumor type ( melanoma , head neck , colorectal , breast , thyroid ) . For HCC patient expand MTD phase : Documentation original biopsy diagnosis acceptable tumor tissue unavailable . Histological confirmation mandatory patient without cirrhosis . Patients cirrhosis may clinical diagnosis HCC American Association Study Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) criteria.cytotoxic chemotherapy ; target agent , include sorafenib ; experimental treatment ) eligible . For nonHCC patient expand MTD phase : The tumor must amenable biopsy patient must willing consent biopsy . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Evidence measurable disease RECIST criterion computer assist tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Normal/adequate swallow capability , functional small bowel intact , malabsorption problem ( order maximally quantify PK absorption characteristic ) . Amylase lipase &lt; equal 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Hemoglobin &gt; equal 8.5 g/L . ANC &gt; equal 1,500/mm3 . Platelet count &gt; equal 75,000/mm3 . Total bilirubin &lt; equal 1.5 x ULN ( For patient HCC , refer criterion number 14 ) . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; equal 2.5 x ULN ( &lt; equal 5 x ULN patient liver involvement ) . PTINR/PTT &lt; equal 1.5 x ULN ( Patients prophylactically anticoagulated agent coumadin low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) therapeutically anticoagulated LMWH allow participate provide meet criterion ; addition , patient must monitor appropriate interval throughout study ) . Patients HCC ChildPugh score 56 ( Class A ) . Creatinine &lt; equal 1.5 x ULN . Patients must pregnant breastfeeding , chemotherapy think present substantial risk fetus/infant . Men woman reproductive potential may participate study unless agree use effective contraceptive method study . No severe uncontrolled intercurrent illness opinion investigator would adversely impact safety efficacy treatment . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent form . Patients must within normal range cardiac function measure echocardiogram multiplegated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan . Previous treatment sorafenib require dose reduction due toxicity . Previous treatment RDEA119 . Patients cytotoxic chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study , recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier , concurrent use cytotoxic chemotherapy indicate study protocol , use investigational agent &lt; 4 week first dose study drug . Previous concurrent cancer distinct primary site histology cancer evaluate study except cervical carcinoma situ , treat basal cell carcinoma , superficial bladder tumor [ Ta , Tis &amp; T1 ] cancer curatively treat &gt; 3 year prior study entry . Swallowing dysfunction and/or malabsorption syndrome would impair sorafenib RDEA119 treatment . Cardiac disease : Congestive heart failure &gt; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class 2 . Patients must unstable angina new onset angina ( within last 3 month ) myocardial infarction ( MI ) within past 6 month . Cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy . Uncontrolled hypertension Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Thrombotic embolic event cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack within past 6 month . Evidence history bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Major surgery , open biopsy significant traumatic injury within 4 week first dose study drug . The use inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 CYP2C19 enzymes , well concurrent treatment agent list Section 3.7 protocol . These medication inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 CYP2C19 discuss sponsor . Patients know hypersensitivity drug component give protocol . Patients abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal ( GI ) perforation , intraabdominal abscess , small bowel resection , within 6 month study entry . Patients abdominal radiation result chronic diarrhea . Patients documented central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis steroid CNS therapy . Evidence uncontrolled active infection except HCV HBV . Other serious medical psychiatric illness would permit patient manage accord protocol .</criteria>
