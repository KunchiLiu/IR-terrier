	<brief_summary>The main purpose study learn educational method helpful patient family member consider whether pursue live donor kidney transplantation . Patients eligible kidney transplant usually get information transplant clinic two type kidney transplant - one kidney come dead donor one kidney come healthy live donor . Patients give information transplant nurse doctor encourage discus family member friend . In study , try see change give patient information make difference patient family member think live donor kidney transplantation . So , look whether get information transplant clinic - either alone group - different get information home . The study recruit African American patient . This do African Americans high likelihood develop chronic kidney disease need kidney transplant patient race . However , wait long kidney transplant die high rate wait list less likely patient receive live donor kidney transplant . We want see educational approach work best African American patient family .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Reduce Disparity Live Donor Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) affect 10 million people United States . Diabetes , hypertension , glomerulonephritis , polycystic kidney disease contribute case CKD . Those CKD become dialysis-dependent consider ESRD . The incidence ESRD increase dramatically last decade estimate 338 per million population . Adults ESRD known experience significant mortality morbidity , evidence significant health disparity Whites ethnic minority . While kidney transplantation treatment choice patient ESRD , wait list wait time decease donor transplantation expand exponentially . Live donor kidney transplantation ( LDKT ) remain viable option patient , yet half wait-listed patient , especially minority , pursue LDKT . Therefore , program design expand LDKT , especially target minority population , need give current project shortage decease donor organ . The long-term goal research program improve education provide African Americans , thereby , increase rate LDKT . The objective application determine relative effectiveness three strategy increase LDKT African Americans . In recently complete HRSA-funded ( 2002-2006 ) randomize clinical trial , demonstrate home-based LDKT intervention program superior standard clinic-based education increase LDKT rate one transplant center . The propose study seek replicate extend evaluation home-based ( HB ) educational intervention African American patient population . The central hypothesis HB intervention yield high LDKT rate relative intervention African Americans . This hypothesis formulate basis strong preliminary data . The rationale propose research , identify intervention likely yield high LDKT rate African Americans , develop refine interventional methodology allow effective education disseminate kidney transplant program . We especially well-prepared conduct propose research due multidisciplinary nature research team , well expertise experience team develop LDKT live donation educational material , implement evaluate novel LDKT intervention , conduct LDKT research African Americans , produce meaningful outcome . Specifically , research team include investigator fund conduct ESRD , kidney transplantation , organ donation research dedicate scientific advancement LDKT . Also , research conduct environment conducive successful completion project . To evaluate central hypothesis accomplish objective propose study , plan pursue follow two specific aim : Specific Aim 1 . Determine clinical effectiveness three separate LDKT educational approach African American patient . Recently , find LDKT educational intervention deliver patient 's home involve patient invited guest ( family , friend , community leader ) effective strategy increase LDKT , especially African Americans . This different educational approach use transplant center , typically involve either group-based ( patient whomever accompanies clinic ) meeting individual patient session . Based work summarize Preliminary Studies section , work hypothesis study patient randomize Home-Based ( HB ) intervention demonstrate favorable outcome relative patient randomize Group-Based ( GB ) intervention conduct transplant clinic Standard Care ( SC ) condition individual patient education transplant clinic . Specifically , relative GB SC educational approach , HB intervention demonstrate ... Primary Outcome : Hypothesis 1.1 : A high proportion enrol patient LDKTs . Secondary Outcomes : Hypothesis 1.2 : A high proportion enrol patient live donor inquiry . Hypothesis 1.3 : A high proportion enrol patient live donor evaluation . Hypothesis 1.4 : A high number potential donor educate , per patient . Hypothesis 1.5 : More improvement live donation knowledge . Hypothesis 1.6 : More improvement live donation concern . Hypothesis 1.7 : More willingness initiate live donor discussion others . Specific Aim 2 . Determine sociodemographic , medical , donation-specific variable strongly associate pursue LDKT . Based work summarize Preliminary Studies section , work hypothesis LDKT status ( primary outcome : yes/no ) vary significantly sociodemographic , medical , donation-specific variable . Specificallyâ€¦ Hypothesis 2.1 : The following patient characteristic significantly associate receive LDKT : male , young , dialysis-dependent , live donor inquiry , knowledge live donation , few concern live donation , willingness initiate live donation discussion others .</detailed_description>
