	<detailed_description>This open label single sequence single group non-randomized two way drug interaction study healthy adult volunteer determine extent quinine , inducer cytochrome p450 CYP 3A4 , affect pharmacokinetics midazolam , accept probe drug CYP 3A4 . The study also determine extent midazolam affect pharmacokinetics quinine . This compare pharmacokinetics midazolam quinine baseline kinetics take together 24 normal healthy adult volunteer serve control . All patient confine study site throughout entire 11 day study period . On day 1 fast least 10 hour , study participant receive single oral dose midazolam 2 mg . Blood drawn time sufficient adequately define baseline concentration time curve midazolam metabolite , 1-hydroxy-midazolam . On morning day 4 , 3 day washout period follow fast least 10 hour , volunteer begin regimen 324 mg quinine sulfate mouth every 8 hour . All subject continue regimen day 4-10 ( 21 total dos ) . Blood drawn first daily dose quinine day 4 9 time sufficient adequately define baseline steady state concentration time curve quinine . Additional blood drawn prior first daily dose quinine day 7,8,9 , 10 . On day 10 fast least 10 hour , participant receive midazolam 2 mg quinine 324 mg together . Blood drawn time sufficient characterize pharmacokinetics midazolam , 1-hydroxy-midazolam quinine state condition .</detailed_description>
