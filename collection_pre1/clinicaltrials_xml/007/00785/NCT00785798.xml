	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm lymphoma relapse refractory least one prior systemic therapy . However , patient relapse refractory appropriate standard salvage therapy , decline deem eligible treatment salvage therapy include stem cell transplant . Diseases Tcell lymphoma , standard salvage therapy , may enroll fail one prior systemic therapy . Patient must measurable disease within lymph node , skin , leukemic involvement lymphoma Patient must performance status ≤2 ECOG Performance Scale . ( See Section 6.1 ) Prior treatment anthracycline permit long total doxorubicin dose ( equivalent ) exceed 450mg/m2 . Patients must normal cardiac function , evidence left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &gt; 50 % . A MUGA scan ( echocardiogram may use MUGA scan available , test must use throughout study ) evaluate LVEF must do within 2 week prior first dose study drug . Patients minimum 3 week since last systemic treatment . Patients prior treatment HDAC inhibitor may enroll 30day washout period . Patients ≥ 18 year age race , sex , ethnicity Life expectancy great 12 week . Female patient childbearing potential negative serum pregnancy test βhCG within 96 hour prior receive first dose vorinostat . Female patient reproductive potential must use adequate contraceptive method ( e.g. , abstinence , intrauterine device , oral contraceptive , barrier device spermicide surgical sterilization ) treatment three month complete treatment . Male patient agree use adequate method contraception duration study . Patient must adequate organ function indicate follow laboratory value : System Laboratory Value Hematological Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1000 /mcL Platelets ≥75,000 /mcL Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Coagulation Prothrombin Time INR ≤1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless receive therapeutic anticoagulation Partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤1.5x ULN unless patient receive therapeutic anticoagulation . Chemistry K level Normal limit Mg level Normal limit Renal Serum creatinine calculate creatinine clearance ≤2.0mg/dL OR ≥40 mL/min patient creatinine level &gt; 2.0mg/dL Hepatic Serum total bilirubin Normal limit AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 X ULN Alkaline Phosphatase ( liver fraction ) ≤ 3 X ULN Creatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard . Patient , patient 's legal representative , voluntarily agree participate give write informed consent . Patient ≥18 year age day sign informed consent . Patient available periodic blood sampling , study related assessment , management treat institution duration study . Eligibility patient receive medication substance know affect potential affect activity pharmacokinetics vorinostat determine follow review case Principal Investigator . Patients previously untreated lymphoma Patient chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biological therapy within 3 week prior initial dose study drug recover adverse event due agent administer 3 week earlier . Patient currently participate participate study investigational compound device within 30 day initial dose study drug . Myocardial infarct within 6 month enrollment , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II great heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , clinically significant pericardial disease , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemic active conduction system abnormalities QTc prolongation great 500ms Patient `` currently active '' second malignancy , nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix , enrol . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy prior malignancy , disease free prior malignancy &gt; 5 year consider physician less 30 % risk relapse . Patient systemic steroid stabilize 3 week prior start study drug . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition vorinostat doxorubicin . History hypersensitivity reaction attribute conventional formulation doxorubicin HCL component PLD . Patients active CNS metastasis and/or carcinomatous meningitis exclude . However , patient CNS metastasis complete course therapy would eligible study provide clinically stable 1 month prior entry define : ( 1 ) evidence new enlarge CNS metastasis ( 2 ) steroid stable dose steroid . Patient know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Patient , time signing informed consent , regular user ( include `` recreational use '' ) illicit drug , substance abuse recent history ( within last year ) drug alcohol abuse . Patient pregnant breast feeding , expect conceive father child within project duration study . Pregnant woman exclude study vorinostat doxorubicin potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother vorinostat PLD , breastfeed discontinue mother treated vorinostat PLD . Patient uncontrolled intercurrent illness circumstance could limit compliance study , include , limited following : active infection , acute chronic graft versus host disease , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric condition . Patient history current evidence condition , therapy , lab abnormality might confound result study , interfere patient 's participation full duration study best interest patient participate . Patient history gastrointestinal surgery procedure might , opinion investigator , interfere absorption swallow study drug . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction vorinostat . Patients known history Hepatitis B C exclude .</criteria>
