	<brief_summary>Individuals use manual wheelchair depend upon upper limb provide mean locomotion completion activity daily live . As result great normal usage upper limb , shoulder pain pathology common among manual wheelchair user . Accordingly , proper wheelchair set-up may paramount prevent injury maintain comfort locomotion . The purpose research study create subject-specific computer model wheelchair propulsion provide information wheelchair set-up ( particular , axle placement ) . The primary objective study investigate effect wheelchair set-up shoulder joint force wheelchair propulsion ; secondary objective develop predictive model identify difference shoulder joint force result alter axle position seat set-up user 's wheelchair . The hypothesis study output patient-specific model reveal current axle position subject result peak shoulder joint force great predict alter axle position ( determined model ) . The overall goal adjust manual wheelchair user 's axle placement one minimize magnitude shoulder joint force throughout propulsion . It intend , repetitive strain injury associate manual wheelchair propulsion may reduce , prolong pain-free way life population .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Experienced Wheelchair Users : Have neurological impairment secondary spinal cord injury occur 1 year prior start study ; SCI T1 ( complete incomplete ) ; Use manual wheelchair primary mean mobility ( least 40 hr . per week necessarily always motion ) ; SCI age 18 Have 24 inch diameter wheel quickrelease axle . History fracture dislocation arm include shoulder , elbow , wrist ; Upper limb dysthetic pain result syrinx reflex sympathetic dystrophy ; Pregnant woman ; Shoulder pain MWU describe limit ability propel manual wheelchair ; History neurologic disorder spinal cord injury ( e.g . brain injury ) . Inexperienced Manual Wheelchair Users : Be age 18 65 year age . History fracture dislocation arm include shoulder , elbow , wrist ; Have musculoskeletal disorder ; Pregnant woman ; Shoulder pain limit ability propel manual wheelchair .</criteria>
