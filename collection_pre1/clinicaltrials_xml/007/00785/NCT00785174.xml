	<brief_summary>Non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) become widely use treatment modality ICU emergency service deal respiratory failure.1 NIV potential improve ventilatory assistance avoid endotracheal intubation complication . Since first publication Meduri2 Brochard3 number study NIV grow develop technique become one major progress field respiratory assistance . Decompensation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) certainly least questionable indication NIV . However , indication NIV inexorably spread type acute respiratory insufficiency , include acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema ( CPE ) .4 Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) currently use non-invasive ventilation usually perform without use ventilator . NIV use pressure support ( NIPSV ) combine pressure support ( inspiratory aid ) positive expiratory pressure CPAP . Based physiological ground , NIPSV would performant CPAP improve ventilatory parameter reduce work breathe APE . However , issue settle yet . Number meta-analysis last 2 year devote comparison CPAP NISPV,5 scientific evidence still far establish . In addition , sur patient enrolled study representative patient APE . The fact include solely basis clinical criterion , risk overlap diagnosis negligible . Thus use marker heart failure BNP ( brain natriuretic peptide ) would useful . On hand , possible deleterious effect NIPSV myocardial perfusion problem definitively resolve . Objectives study : 1 . Compare efficacy safety NIPSV CPAP patient present emergency department CPE . 2 . Compare two procedure subgroups patient hypercapnia high BNP concentration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Ventilation Versus Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema : Multicentre Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiogenic pulmonary edema define increase hydrostatic pressure pulmonary microcirculation result postcapillaire hypertension . The direct consequence extravasation fluid alveolar interstitial tissue , lead acute hypoxemia decrease lung compliance . The decrease lung compliance , increase airway resistance ( interstitial bronchial edema ) hypoxemia cause increase work breathe . The imbalance ability respiratory muscle generate effective gas exchange exaggerated ventilatory load lead respiratory muscle fatigue require use mechanical ventilation endotracheal prosthesis . In addition , increase inspiratory muscle work CPE generates important pleural depression , increase transmural pressure leave ventricular afterload thus increase pulmonary edema . The CPAP non-invasive ventilation mode currently use CPE . It usually obtain via mask expiratory valve maintain constant pressure circuit . No inspiratory assistance provide patient . The BOUSSIGNAC valve currently use clinical practice adjunct pharmacological treatment CPE.The effect CPAP mainly link ability recruit zone collapse expiration . • NIPSV combine positive expiratory pressure ventilatory assistance pressure inspiration deliver ventilator . It correspond CPAP associate inspiratory assistance , thus , likely improve ventilation parameter , particular reduce respiratory work efficiently CPAP alone.These beneficial physiological effect NIPSV well demonstrate decompensation COPD ; wait confirm CPE . Physiological study show NIPSV effective term reduce work breathe CPE . However , none 7 publish randomized study show superiority NIPSV compare CPAP term reduce mortality intubation requirement</detailed_description>
