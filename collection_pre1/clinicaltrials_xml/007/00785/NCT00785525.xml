	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - Establish evaluate system collection filgrastim-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell National Marrow Donor Program donor ( NMDP ) donor - Assess safety among NMDP donor filgrastim administration PBSC leukapheresis - Assess safety efficacy filgrastim-mobilized PBSC unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient - Determine acceptability stem cell donation filgrastim stimulate apheresis normal donor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Filgrastim-Mobilized Stem Cells Transplantation Using Unrelated Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For many year , allogeneic bone marrow transplantation use successfully treat leukemia , hematologic condition congenital disorder . The first unrelated donor transplant perform late 1970s , procedure become widely available development several consolidate unrelated donor registry around world . The National Marrow Donor Program , establish 1987 , world 's large registry currently list 7 million donor . Since beginning , NMDP facilitate 30,000 unrelated transplant . Although licensed indication , considerable experience accumulate concern administration filgrastim normal adult . Most adult volunteer research subject donor PBSC use relate donor transplant . Beginning February 1997 , filgrastim stimulate PBSC collect NMDP donor protocol . The protocol ( locally refer G2 ) begin NMDP-sponsored Investigational New Drug ( IND ) application file FDA collect PBSC second donation follow initial donation bone marrow . In 1999 second protocol open ( locally refer G1 ) request PBSC primary donation source become common . In 2005 two protocol combine eliminate redundancy provide ease use . The protocol establish evaluate system supply peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) product use unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) transplantation . The protocol describe process donor identification , education evaluation . Procedures administration monitor stem cell mobilize agent filgrastim include . The protocol also describe procedure collection PBSC product leukapheresis include provision long term donor follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PBSC donor must meet criterion NMDP marrow donor . These criterion set forth NMDP Standards Donor Center Manual Operations . Pregnancy uninterruptible breastfeeding . Pregnancy absolute contraindication protocol . Women breastfeed must willing able interrupt breastfeed administration filgrastim two day follow final dose . Sensitivity filgrastim E. coliderived recombinant protein product . History autoimmune disorder , include rheumatic disease thyroid disorder . Exception : As bone marrow donation , donor history thyroid disease undergone successful therapy may suitable . History deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism . History iritis episcleritis . Thrombocytopenia &lt; 150 x 10 ( 9 ) /L ( &lt; 150,000/µL ) baseline evaluation . Current treatment lithium . Drug interaction filgrastim lithium , may potentiate release neutrophil , fully evaluate . Positive HemoglobinSolubility ( e.g. , SickleDex™ equivalent ) test . Donors receive experimental therapy investigational agent .</criteria>
