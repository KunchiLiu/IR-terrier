	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare standard occupational therapy combination conventional ( standard ) robotic therapy . The Reo Go device provide robotic therapy give therapist tool could make stroke treatment faster well help patient practice accurate arm movement help device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Robot-assisted Arm Therapy Acute Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESES - Motor function significantly great patient robotic train group measure standard clinical evaluation . - Functional independence gain similar group robotic therapy task-specific activity daily live ( ADL ) . - Robotic training reduce pain spasticity effectively conventional therapy alone , due increase number movement perform robotic training . - Muscle activation pattern patient receive robotic training show decreased agonist/antagonist co-contraction less erratic muscle activation . - Robotic training patient demonstrate significantly great ROM , movement accuracy high movement speed exercise perform part robotic training . For robotic exercise perform part robotic assessment , improvement significantly less practiced movement .</detailed_description>
