	<brief_summary>This study conduct order determine whether IMA910 single agent GM-CSF adjuvant follow pre-treatment low-dose cyclophosphamide safe show sufficient anti-tumour effectiveness patient advance CRC warrant development . Secondary objective study investigation immunological parameter additional effectiveness endpoint . Furthermore , safety , immunological parameter effectiveness IMA910 single agent GM-CSF combination imiquimod follow pre-treatment low-dose cyclophosphamide investigate 2nd cohort patient . The regular study duration individual patient 1st 2nd cohort comprises regularly 18-42 day screen ( exclude HLA-typing ) , 33 week treatment ( 16 vaccination ) 4 week follow-up . Thus , period start screen end trial 10 month per patient . Patients follow response subsequent treatment ( chemotherapy without targeted agent ) survival every 2 month EOS visit death . Patients 1st 2nd cohort withdrawn study treatment progress accord RECIST note . An enrolment plan first 6 patient include 1st cohort part study ensure maximum safety study participant .

	<brief_title>IMA910 Plus GM-CSF With Low-dose Cyclophosphamide Pre-treatment Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma Patients Following Successful 12 Week First-line Treatment With Oxaliplatin-based Chemotherapy ( IMA910-101 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicentre , open-label , Phase 1-2 study patient locally advance and/or metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) investigate effectiveness , safety immunogenicity tumour multi-peptide vaccine IMA910 plus GM-CSF ( 1st cohort ) give monotherapy successful ( CR , PR SD ) completion 12 week first-line oxaliplatin-based standard chemotherapy ( e.g . FOLFOX , XELOX ) . Safety , immunogenicity effectiveness IMA910 plus GM-CSF combination imiquimod investigate 2nd cohort patient locally advance and/or metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) successful ( CR , PR SD ) completion 12 week first-line oxaliplatin-based standard chemotherapy ( e.g . FOLFOX , XELOX ) . The aim study investigate whether IMA910 plus GM-CSF ( 1st cohort ) effective maintenance therapy favorable toxicity profile . A single dose low-dose cyclophosphamide apply immune modulator 3 day start vaccination . Effectiveness measure term disease control rate ( DCR ) Visit 14 ( = 27 week vaccination ) accord RECIST . The baseline tumour response assessment perform first-line oxaliplatin-based standard chemotherapy 12 week . The DCR compare effect level 21 % derive PFS curve chemotherapy-free interval cohort ( arm B ) OPTIMOX 2 study . Tumour response assessment perform every 9 week accord RECIST . Further 2nd cohort patient treat IMA910 plus GM-CSF combination imiquimod single dose lowdose cyclophosphamide . The aim 2nd cohort investigate whether addition imiquimod safe , enhances immune response IMA910 show effectiveness . Patients 1st 2nd cohort withdrawn study treatment progress accord RECIST note . An enrolment plan first 6 patient include 1st cohort part study ensure maximum safety study participant . The enrollment first 6 patient 2nd cohort also follow enrolment plan ensure maximum safety . Patients must HLA-A*02-positive . Patients must diagnose unresectable , locally advanced and/or metastatic colorectal cancer first-line chemotherapy . Patients must complete 12 week first-line oxaliplatin-based standard chemotherapy ( e.g . FOLFOX XELOX ) either complete partial response stable disease outcome . In case 12 week first-line oxaliplatin-based standard chemotherapy result resectable disease patient may enrol routinely undergoes surgical resection residual tumour . Patients must age 18 year old must histological confirm colorectal adenocarcinoma ( CRC ) radiological evidence ( CT/MRI ) unresectable locally advanced and/or metastatic CRC prior 12 week first-line oxaliplatin-based standard chemotherapy . This study employ low-dose Cyclophosphamide ( administer single i.v . infusion dose 300 mg/m2 3 day prior vaccination ) order increase immune response IMA910 ( 5.78 mg i.d. ) . Patients receive 7 vaccination IMA910 plus GM-CSF ( 75 μg i.d . ) first 6 week treatment ( induction period ) follow 9 vaccination 3-week interval 27 week ( maintenance period ) . The patient receive total 16 vaccination period 33 week . An end study visit ( EOS , Visit 17 ) perform 4 week last treatment . Patients enrol 2nd cohort study receive treatment describe additionally receive topical application 250 mg imiquimod cream ( 12.5 mg imiquimod ) 10 minute ( 20 minute ) application IMA910 ( Visit 1-16 ) day 3 onwards 250 mg imiquimod cream ( 12.5 mg imiquimod ) 24 hour ( 48 hour late ) application IMA910 ( Visit 3-16 ) . The topical application imiquimod additionally 24 hour ( 48 hour late ) IMA910 application do patient home . Imiquimod cream apply marked 5x5 cm area around injection site GM-CSF IMA910 . At screen CT MRI chest abdomen/pelvis perform assess baseline tumour status . In patient suspected brain metastasis Screening clinically indicate CT MRI brain perform . In patient know bone metastasis extremity case suspect bone metastasis extremities Screening correlative imaging ( X-ray , CT MRI ) perform respective area ( ) . At Visits 8 , 11 , 14 , 17 ( EOS ) CT MRI chest , abdomen pelvis perform . In patient bone metastasis extremity detect baseline study , repeat assessment sit bone metastasis ( X-ray , CT MRI ) perform Visits 14 17 ( EOS ) . An assessment brain metastasis perform clinically indicated course study . Cellular immunomonitoring ( T-cell response peptide contain IMA910 analysis immune cell population may influence T-cell response Tregs ) , serum level antibody molecule suspect influence immune response assess several occasion study . In subgroup patient follow parameter may assess tumour tissue ( depend amount quality tissue ) : expression target gene encode TUMAPs contain IMA910 gene might influence IMA910 , presentation TUMAPs contain IMA910 , presence tumour infiltrate lymphocyte presence molecule suspect influence immune response . Safety assessment comprise continuous adverse event reporting , regular physical examination regular assessment vital sign , haematology , blood chemistry urine . A 12-lead ECG perform screen end study . Pregnancy test perform accord applicable legislation country trial perform . At least , woman childbearing potential must undergo pregnancy test screening study , first dose end study . In initial phase study 6 patient 1st Cohort treat step-wise observe 21 day accord pre-specified enrolment plan . The first step enrolment 1 patient follow observation period 21 day , thereafter enrolment 2 patient follow observation period 21 day thereafter 3 patient follow observation period 21 day . The sponsor evaluate adverse event laboratory data follow every enrolment step initiate enrolment next enrolment step . After 6 patient enrolled way subsequent enrolment perform without restriction . Further also 2nd Cohort first 6 patient 2nd cohort enrol step-wise manner . The first step enrolment 1 patient follow observation period 1 week , thereafter enrolment 2 patient follow observation period 1 week thereafter enrolment 3 patient follow observation period 1 week . The sponsor evaluate adverse event follow every enrolment step initiate enrolment next enrolment step . After 6 patient enrolled way subsequent enrolment perform without restriction .</detailed_description>
