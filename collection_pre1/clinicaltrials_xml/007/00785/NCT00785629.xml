	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine ability 3 commercially available phosphorus binder ( calcium acetate , sevelamer carbonate , lanthanum carbonate ) achieve maintain phosphorus level normal range patient chronic kidney disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Double Blind Randomized Placebo Trial Maintenance Normal Serum Phosphorus CKD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It specific aim pilot study assess feasibility achieve maintain serum P le equal 3.5 mg/dL ( 1.13 mmol/L ) patient eGFR &gt; 20 &lt; 45 mL/min 3 commercially available P lower agent ( calcium acetate , sevelamer carbonate , lanthanum carbonate ) . Results study clarify degree separation serum P achieve use P lower agent current standard care ( P binder initiation P &gt; 5.5 mg/dL 1.78 mmol/L ) . Furthermore , knowledge , combine analysis secondary aim outcomes interest , serve facilitate design properly power , randomize , placebo control clinical outcome trial firmly establish necessity achieve specific target P patient CKD . The secondary aim pilot study provide insight optimal detection progression abnormalities mineral metabolism relationship vascular disease CKD . The tertiary aim evaluate long term outcomes related phosphorus normalization respect renal replacement therapy death .</detailed_description>
