	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Treatment raltegravir alter V ( D ) J recombination immune response neoantigens . A process know V ( D ) J recombination essential develop lymphocyte specific function immune system . Raltegravir first approve drug new integrase inhibitor class anti-HIV drug . Integrase inhibitor show study interfere DNA cleavage activity RAG-1/2 . These study suggest potential affect aspect B-cell T-cell development , therefore , important evaluate potential effect integrase inhibitor may clinical use . If immunoglobulin T-cell receptor gene alter HIV integrase , patient lymphocyte fail display normal response vaccination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>V ( D ) J recombination essential develop lymphocyte specific function immune system . Germline gene cod segment become rearranged create functional immunoglobulin T-cell receptor gene recombination . The process depend site-specific cleavage chromosomal DNA RAG-1 RAG-2 recombinase . Two recombination-activating gene protein ( RAG-1/2 ) conjunction make complex enzyme join gene segment B-cell T-cell receptor gene . RAG-1 contains V ( D ) J recombinase active site RAG-2 essential joining DNA segment V ( D ) J recombination . RAG-1/2 similarity action DNA transposases HIV-1 integrase . These similarity suggest HIV-1 integrase inhibitor may potential affect aspect B-cell T-cell development . Induction primary immune response neoantigens involve generation specific T-cells immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) antibody secrete B-cells . As part process , T B memory cell also generate , specific cell surface receptor antigen . On repeat exposure antigen , memory T- B-cells trigger generate rapid intense secondary response . During secondary response , B-cells secrete abundant specific IgG antibody great affinity antigen IgM isotope . This memory response mediate T-cells CD45+ RO+ phenotype . These T-cells provide B-cells help require generate specific IgG . Sub-optimal antibody response see acquire hereditary immunodeficiency , due impair T-cell function include poor T-helper response B-cells defective neo-antigen response . An establish method evaluate T-cell function involve test antibody production vaccination phiX174 , stable bacteriophage E. Coli critical demonstrate T-cell competence . Antibody titer primary secondary immunization correlate abnormal CD4 cell help . Patients functional B-cells lack T-cell help show characteristic failure switch IgM IgG , make assay essential evaluation V ( D ) J recombination . Currently , raltegravir approved integrase inhibitor target integration stage HIV-1 lifecycle . The clinical manifestation raltegravir-related potential adverse effect V ( D ) J recombination may rare may observe large number patient exposed drug . Evaluating direct vivo interaction HIV integrase inhibitor RAG-1/2 difficult , therefore best approach may evaluate potential negative effect recombinase activity downstream study immune function . If gene rearrangement immunoglobulin T-cell receptor gene alter HIV integrase , patient lymphocyte fail display normal response neo-antigen exposure . Since untreated HIV-infected individual impaired ability respond new antigen , difficult evaluate response neo-antigens individual . Therefore , test hypothesis , would best choose patient long-term control HIV recover immune function .</detailed_description>
