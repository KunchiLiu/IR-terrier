	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study side effect well different chemotherapy regimen without bevacizumab work treat patient stage IIIC stage IV breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ( nab-paclitaxel ) , ixabepilone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Bevacizumab may block tumor growth target certain cell slow growth blood vessel tumor . It yet know treatment regimen effective treat patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient metastatic breast cancer receive nab-paclitaxel versus paclitaxel ( control arm ) . II . To compare PFS patient receive ixabepilone versus paclitaxel . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare objective response rate , duration response , time treatment failure patient receive nab-paclitaxel versus paclitaxel , separately compare endpoint patient receive ixabepilone versus paclitaxel . II . To compare 12-month rate progression patient receive nab-paclitaxel versus paclitaxel , separately compare endpoint patient receive ixabepilone versus paclitaxel . III . To determine toxicity patient receive nab-paclitaxel compare paclitaxel , patient receive ixabepilone compare paclitaxel . IV . To compare overall survival patient receive nab-paclitaxel versus paclitaxel , separately compare overall survival patient receive ixabepilone versus paclitaxel . V. To evaluate relationship secrete protein , acidic , cysteine-rich ( SPARC ) overexpression change blood level caveolin-1 ( Cav-1 ) PFS secondary endpoint response treatment nab-paclitaxel compare paclitaxel , ixabepilone compare paclitaxel . VI . To evaluate relationship change blood level circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) PFS secondary endpoint response treatment nab-paclitaxel compare paclitaxel , ixabepilone compare paclitaxel . VII . To evaluate association expression level microtubule associate protein tau beta-tubulin isotype composition PFS secondary endpoint response treatment nab-paclitaxel compare paclitaxel , ixabepilone compare paclitaxel . VIII . To investigate potential cytochrome P450 , family 2 , subfamily C polypeptide 8 , 2 , 3 ( CYP2C8*2/*3 ) paclitaxel interaction respect progression-free survival ( PFS ) . IX . To determine CYP2C8*2 CPY2C8*3 associate paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy . X . To perform exploratory analysis cytochrome P450 , family 3 , subfamily A , polypeptide 4 ( CYP3A4 ) , cytochrome P450 , family 3 , subfamily A , polypeptide 5 ( CYP3A5 ) , ATP-binding cassette , sub-family B ( MDR/TAP ) , member 1 ( ABCB1 ) ATP-binding cassette , sub-family C ( CFTR/MRP ) , member 2 ( ABCC2 ) polymorphisms response toxicity profile . XI . To prospectively collect data sociodemographics , non-cancer morbidity , receipt post-trial therapy evaluate role potential disparity survival cancer . XII . To evaluate relationship physical activity behavior time enrollment protocol progression-free overall survival . XIII . To identify baseline factor predict risk grade 3 , 4 , 5 toxicity patient receive treatment weekly paclitaxel , nab-paclitaxel , ixabepilone combine without bevacizumab . XIV . To perform exploratory analysis whether factor include patient assessment ( either individually combination ) predict risk grade 3 , 4 , 5 toxicity patient receive weekly paclitaxel , nab-paclitaxel , ixabepilone combine without bevacizumab , specific focus relationship pre-existing hypertension neuropathy . XV . To compare association baseline factor grade 3 , 4 , 5 toxicity patient receive weekly paclitaxel , nab-paclitaxel , ixabepilone combine without bevacizumab . XVI . To explore whether longitudinal change factor association occurrence grade 3 , 4 , 5 toxicity patient weekly paclitaxel , nab-paclitaxel , ixabepilone combine without bevacizumab . XVII . To explore association grade 2-4 neuropathy longitudinal change follow functional status measure : ) Older Americans Resources Services ( OARS ) Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire ( MFAQ ) ( Instrumental Activities Daily Living [ IADL ] ) ; b ) Medical Outcomes Study ( MOS ) Physical Functioning ; c ) Karnofsky Performance Status Rated Healthcare Professional ; ) Timed `` Up Go '' ; e ) OARS Physical Health Section . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM A ( WEEKLY PACLITAXEL ) : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . ARM B ( WEEKLY NAB-PACLITAXEL ) : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients may also receive bevacizumab Arm A . ARM C ( WEEKLY IXABEPILONE ) : Patients receive ixabepilone IV 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients may also receive bevacizumab Arm A . ( close accrual 7/18/11 ) In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
