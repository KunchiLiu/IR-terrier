	<brief_summary>The effect mild moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 30 50 ml/min &gt; 50 80 ml/min , respectively ) pharmacokinetic profile quinine active metabolite , 3'-hydroxyquinine , investigated . Safety tolerability healthy subject versus mild moderate renal impairment compare , well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Quinine Sulfate Healthy Patients Patients With Renal Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since many adverse event associate quinine dose-related , important consider vary degree renal dysfunction alter quinine pharmacokinetics possibly warrant dosage adjustment patient . This study compare pharmacokinetics quinine patient normal , mild moderate renal impairment . Eighteen non-smoking male female volunteer 18-65 year age weigh least 60 kg BMI 18- 40 kg/m2 divide 3 group 6 subject base renal function define ( 6 normal , 6 mild impairment , 6 moderate impairment ) . Subjects confine study unit entire 5 day study period begin even Day -3 . To confirm renal function classification , creatinine clearance measure via 24-hour urine collection 7am Day -2 7am Day -1 . On day 1 , fast least 8 hour , patient receive single 648 mg dose quinine sulfate . Blood urine sample collect time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics quinine active metabolite , 3'-hydroxyquinine ) three study group . Subjects monitor regard adverse effect throughout study participation .</detailed_description>
