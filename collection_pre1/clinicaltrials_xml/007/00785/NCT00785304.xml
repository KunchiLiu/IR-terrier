	<brief_summary>Thousands soldier , marine , military personnel injury brain due war Iraq Afghanistan . In addition , 1.5 million civilian per year United States traumatic brain injury cause car accident , fall , sports-related injury assault . There important advance technology think help u learn lot injury . One advance involve new type MRI scan think able show happen brain trauma clearly regular scan . These first new scan call diffusion tensor imaging , show injury axon ( wire brain ) . The second new scan call resting-state functional MRI correlation analysis , show well various part brain connect . Importantly , new type scan do use regular scanner already every major hospital . The innovation entirely scanner use result picture analyze computer take . Our overall goal see whether new MRI scan useful people traumatic brain injury . We already test civilian brain injury patient find helpful . For study , test military personnel traumatic brain injury cause explosion . The specific goal see amount injury see use predict well patient overall next 6-12 month . We think new scan able predict overall outcome well regular scan information . A related goal see whether injury specific part brain see new scan use predict whether patient likely specific problem like memory loss , attention deficit , depression , post-traumatic stress disorder . A final goal repeat scan 6-12 month later see whether new MRI scan show whether injury brain heal , gotten bad , stay . If study successful , show new MRI technique use make early accurate diagnosis traumatic brain injury , prediction sort problem likely occur brain injury , assessment severe injury . This study help traumatic brain injury patient . It useful military personnel brain injury due explosion . It highly likely also useful young adult brain injury due cause like car accident , sports-related concussion , fall , assault . It possible known sure whether help young child old adult traumatic brain injury . These new scan could help decision whether military personnel return duty , sort rehabilitation would benefit , family member watch expect . This could become used hospital within 2 year , could become standard every major hospital within 5 year . The new scan could also helpful develop new treatment . For example , new drug work block injury axon , would good idea test people injury axon . Right good way tell people , new drug like would get tested lot people n't injure axon , along . This would make hard tell new drug work . With new scan able tell injured axon , tell severe injury , figure test drug . It likely take 10 year develop new drug like . Further future , new scan could use help guide surgery implant computer chip help rewire brain . We n't know long take , estimate 15-20 year . Overall MRI scanning safe know major risk . Because scanner use strong magnet , anyone metal object body ca n't scan , could dangerous . We make sure one metal object body include study . There psychological risk involve take test answer question , usually mild manage . There always risk important confidential information make public could consequence . We everything possible maintain confidentiality . Nearly information identify use code number name person , keep securely .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced MRI Blast-related TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In traumatic brain injury , axonal damage major pathophysiological process may primary cause adverse neurological outcome . However , traumatic axonal injury effect brain functional connectivity difficult directly detect quantify living patient . Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) appear great promise regard detect axonal injury . Resting-state fMRI correlation analysis likewise may powerful broadly applicable method investigate brain functional connectivity . In preliminary study , two technique successfully use together several civilian TBI patient . They appear synergistically cross validate ; disrupt functional connectivity underlie focal neurological deficit reveal use resting-state fMRI correlation analysis DTI demonstrate axonal injury responsible disruption . Conventional MRI CT entirely fail explain many deficit . This cross validation important add confidence interpretation result . Without resting-state fMRI correlation analysis , consequence apparent axonal injury DTI functional connectivity brain may clear ; axonal injury could white matter tract redundant , severe enough functionally important . Without DTI , cause disruption connectivity see use resting-state fMRI correlation analysis likewise always know ; process traumatic axonal injury could responsible . Both advanced technique along full conventional MRI perform standard clinical MRI scanner approximately 45 minute per patient . Apart preliminary study , resting-state fMRI DTI use together investigate traumatic brain injury . Objective/Hypothesis : The objective proposal test two advance MRI method , DTI resting-state fMRI , active-duty military blast-related TBI patient acutely injury correlate finding TBI-related clinical outcome 6-12 month later . These method may add clinically useful predictive information follow traumatic brain injury could assistance standardize diagnostic criterion TBI , make return-to-duty triage decision , guide post-injury rehabilitation , develop novel therapeutic . The overarch hypothesis guide project traumatic axonal injury principal cause impair brain function follow blast-related TBI . Specific hypothesis test : 1 . DTI resting-state fMRI correlation analysis noninvasively reveal abnormality present CT conventional MRI acutely follow blast-related TBI . 2 . Specific pattern acute axonal injury ( DTI ) cause disruption brain functional connectivity ( resting-state fMRI correlation analysis ) predict specific neurological , neuropsychological , psychiatric deficit disorder . 3 . The overall burden acute axonal injury disrupt brain functional connectivity strongly predict overall 6-12 month clinical outcome . Specific Aims : 1 ) obtain DTI , resting-state fMRI conventional MRI scan acutely blast-related TBI active-duty military personnel present Landstuhl Regional Medical Center ( LRMC ) . 2 ) collect detailed clinical information TBI-related outcomes 6-12 month injury . 3 ) extensively analyze acute image predictor correlate 6-12 month clinical outcome . Study Design : We propose prospective , observational study 80 active duty military personnel sustain blast-related TBI . Initial scan perform within 4 day injury LRMC . Follow-up occur monthly telephone person Washington University 6-12 month injury . Clinical information TBI outcomes collect include global outcome assessment , neuropsychological test memory , attention executive function deficit , motor performance measure , clinician administer rating scale depression post-traumatic stress disorder . Controls include 1 ) additional group 20 active duty military personnel injury , TBI , 2 ) age , gender education-based norm standardize test assessment result . Repeat DTI , resting-state fMRI , conventional MRI perform track evolution injury . Analysis approach include prespecified hypothesis base know brain anatomical-clinical correlation several exploratory approach , structural base many post-traumatic neurological neuropsychological deficit well understood . Non-parametric correlational statistical method rigorous correction multiple comparison employ . Expert collaborator logistics coordinator already recruit . Confidentiality privacy tightly control .</detailed_description>
