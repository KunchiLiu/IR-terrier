	<detailed_description>- Study participant patient undergone lung transplantation last 6 month stable clinical position time enrollment . - Patients meet study inclusion exclusion criterion enrol study . - The enrolled patient record VRI occurrence standard procedure perform : - Baseline study enrollment ( VRI Recording 1 + standard evaluation ) . - At follow-up visit [ 1 , 3 , 6 month baseline visit ] 6 month follow-up period study ( VRI Recordings + standard evaluation ( possible ) ) . - In event bronchoscopic intervention , interventional procedure ( VRI Recording 1 + standard evaluation ) recurrent interventional procedure ( VRI Recordings + standard evaluation ) course study ( 6-month follow-up period ) . - 1 hour bronchoscopic interventional procedure . - In event unanticipated visit , VRI record perform ( VRI Recordings + standard evaluation ) . - All subject record accord standard procedure ; moreover , essential subject repeatable recording perform manner ( i.e . breathe manner matrix placement ) . Each VRI record session take ~15 minute [ actual recording ~2 minute placement breathing/recording ] . - Standard evaluation procedure may include follow : - Lung function test ( test require visit ) - Physical examination - Bronchoscopy ( e.g . transbronchial biopsy ) - CT-imaging - Chest x-ray - V/Q Scan ( Baseline visit single lung transplantation ) - Blood gas ( test require visit ) - Blood test</detailed_description>
