	<brief_title>Use MRI PET Assessing Disease Activity Takayasu 's Arteritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Takayasu 's arteritis rare inflammatory disease affect aorta branch . The disease much common female male , disease onset typically occur age 15 30 . People disease often experience general discomfort , fatigue , fever , night sweat , weight loss , joint pain . In late stage disease , weak arterial wall may lead aneurysm . Many patient exhibit visible symptom point , however . Because many people Takayasu 's arteritis overt disease symptom , assessment disease activity difficult . Laboratory test help , often unreliable . Novel approach assess disease activity urgently need enhance facilitate research Takayasu 's arteritis . This study determine effectiveness combination positron emission tomography/computed axial tomography ( PET/CT ) assess disease activity people Takayasu 's arteritis . Participants study enroll disease active . The first PET/CT scan take place upon study entry , active disease . Participants second PET/CT scan 3 month later , third scan 3 month still active disease present . Participants maximum 3 scan unless scan need repeat technical failure , though often happen . If active disease time second scan , third scan do . All PET/CT scan schedule within 10 day participant ' routine MRI scan . This study require follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
