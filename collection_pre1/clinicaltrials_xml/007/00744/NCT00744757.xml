	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Decitabine Participants With Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( medical research study participant researcher tell treatment participant receive , `` unblinded '' ) , multi-center ( 1 hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , single-arm study decitabine . The study consist 5 phase : Pre-treatment phase ( 30 day first dose ) , Treatment phase ( consist 8 cycle , cycle 28 day ) , End-of-treatment phase ( consist 30-42 day last dose cycle 8 , time discontinuation ) , Extension phase ( 1 cycle 4 week ) Post-study phase follow-up phase ( every 2 month 1 year , lose follow-up death ) . Participants achieve complete remission ( medical problem get good go away least ) treat least 2 cycle first documentation complete response ( CR ) , treatment discontinue . Decitabine dose 20 milligram per square meter ( mg per m^2 ) administer intravenously 1 hour infusion , 1 hour , daily 5 consecutive day 28 day cycle 8 cycle continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity . The primary objective evaluate best response rate ( complete response partial response ) . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
