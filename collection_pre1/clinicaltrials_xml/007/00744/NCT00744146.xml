	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics immunogenicity Protexia , experimental drug develop protect soldier effect nerve agent . Volunteers enter one five group . Four group receive single intramuscular dose Protexia saline placebo Study Day 1 participate study approximately 71 day . One group receive two intramuscular dos Protexia saline placebo - one dose Study Day 1 second dose Study Day 72 . This group participate study approximately 142 day . All volunteer remain study site inpatient three day dose monitored closely study doctor staff . After , volunteer return study site outpatient predetermined interval . Groups 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 total 6 follow-up visit Group 3 total 12 follow-up visit . It expect study provide important information safety tolerabiity Protexia one two dos .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First Time Human Study Protexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protexia pegylated form recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase ( PEG-rBChE ) . Butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ) naturally-occurring enzyme find minute quantity blood . PharmAthene produce PEG-rBChE milk transgenic goat . The enzyme purify goat milk , formulate pegylated create Protexia . This dose escalation study five dose level Protexia . Safety data 14 day post-dosing evaluated independent Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) prior escalate high dose . The safety tolerability Protexia assess use DMID Adult Toxicity Table , May 2001 ( Appendix D ) . If dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) identify dose group , dose suspend AE ( ) is/are assess . The SMC determine study continue previous dose declare maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . It possible additional dosing group dose midway previous dose group dose level exceed MTD may enrol consultation agreement SMC .</detailed_description>
