	<brief_summary>NSCLC patient often cerebral metastasis : 10 % diagnosis 40 % disease management . Neurosurgery indicate majority case presence several lesion brain , failure primary tumor control presence extra-cerebral metastasis . Cerebral metastasis lead death 30 50 % case . Management patient situation base supportive care whole-brain radiotherapy . The place chemotherapy patient good performance status discuss long time admit . However , place new drug pemetrexed , currently use second line treatment NSCLC , need study . It know pemetrexed add cisplatin treatment NSCLC provide similar effectiveness compare drug association commonly use indication . In addition , Cisplatin Pemetrexed probably present good safety profile . The present study base upon hypothesis stipulate association cisplatin-pemetrexed least efficient others association currently use treatment NSCLC present good safety profile . The primary objective study overall response rate brain metastasis accord RECIST criterion . Secondary judgment criterias : Overall response rate , PFS first-line CDDP plus pemetrexed , safety profile , quality life , neurological symptom , overall survival . The trial enroll 45 patient single-arm two-stage sequential phase II study possibility stop study early lack efficacy .</brief_summary>

Patient brain metastasis amenable surgery radiosurgery curative intent At least one brain measurable lesion use RECIST criterion ECOG Performance Status â‰¤2 No prior chemotherapy cancer Prior surgery allow provide relapse progression procedure . Adequate organ function include follow : Adequate bone marrow reserve : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) superior equal 1.5 X109/L , platelet superior equal 100 X 109/L , hemoglobin superior equal 9 g/dL ; Hepatic : bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; 3xULN ( &lt; 5xULN liver metastasis ) ; Renal : Calculated creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) superior equal 45mL/min base standard Cockroft Gault formula Signed inform consent document patient Patient must least 18 year age . Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . Effective contraception ( men woman ) 6 month follow end treatment Symptomatic brain metastasis Have receive prior radiotherapy brain metastasis Unable unwilling take folic acid , vitamin B12 supplementation dexamethasone ( equivalent corticosteroid ) ; inability comply protocol study related procedure . A prior malignancy NSCLC , except carcinoma situ cervix nonmelanoma skin cancer , adequately treat low grade [ Gleason score &lt; 6 ] localize prostate cancer , unless prior malignancy diagnose definitively treat least 5 year previously subsequent evidence recurrence Serious concomitant systemic disorder ( example , active infection abnormal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) indicative cardiac disease ) , opinion investigator , would compromise safety patient his/her ability complete study . Inability discontinue administration aspirin dose &gt; 1.3g/day nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent 2 day , day , 2 day dose pemetrexed ( 5 day prior longacting agent piroxicam ) . Presence fluid accumulation third space , e.g. , ascite pleural effusion , detect clinically ( physical examination ) , adequately control drainage procedure prior inclusion study . Peripheral neuropathy &gt; CTC Grade 2 Patient compliance geographic distance preclude adequate follow .</criteria>
