	<detailed_description>Problem Be Investigated . Transient leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction occur follow cardiac surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass/cardioplegic arrest ( CPB ) contribute complex post-operative course.1-6 One factor contribute LV myocardial dysfunction ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) attendant CPB . Myocardial contractile performance predicate upon transduction myocyte shorten overall muscle contraction . The extracellular matrix ( ECM ) play critical role process provide coordination connection individually contract myocytes translate efficient muscle contraction.7-12 Acute change within ECM demonstrate I/R , turn would affect myocardial contractile function.13-18 Specifically I/R , increase release ECM proteolytic enzyme , matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) .15-19 Moreover , demonstrate increased release MMPs patient follow CPB.17 The ECM also important reservoir bioactive molecule signal protein . Neurohormonal activation , common occurrence I/R CPB , evoke release potent bioactive peptide endothelin-1 ( ET ) .20-25 Our laboratory others demonstrate ET receptor activation ( primarily ET-A subtype ) follow I/R CPB contribute myocardial dysfunction.20,21,23,26-28 Importantly , ET-A receptor activation induce release MMPs.29-33 Thus , likely number upstream signal pathway contribute MMP induction/activation I/R , basic research provide link ET receptor activation MMP induction . This laboratory poise establish mechanistic relation operative patient . Hypothesis . The central hypothesis project ET release ECM patient follow cardioplegic arrest reperfusion ( I/R ) , turn stimulate ET-A receptor evokes MMP induction/activation . Specific Aims . Through validated microdialysis approach,18,24,34,35 directly quantify myocardial interstitial ET MMP activity patient cardiac surgery . We recently demonstrate infusion selective ET-A receptor antagonist deploy patient undergoing cardiac surgery.37 Finally , develop high sensitivity method measure MMP profile patients.17,19 Through approach , project address follow : ( 1 ) Demonstrate patient require CPB reperfusion direct temporal relationship exist myocardial interstitial ET release MMP activation . Baseline intra-operative myocardial interstitial ET level specific MMP activity ( microdialysis/specific MMP fluorogenic substrate ) 18,24,34,35 measured patient , CPB order establish direct relationship ET release specific MMP activation . ( 2 ) Demonstrate selective ET-A receptor inhibition institute time reperfusion , reduce intra-operative myocardial interstitial MMP activation . Using validated microdialysis approach selective infusible ET-A antagonist establish laboratory,17,37 direct inter-relationship ET-A receptor activation local myocardial MMP induction/activation establish human . ( 3 ) Demonstrate ET-A receptor activation occur early follow I/R induces cytokine signal cascade contributes persistent MMP release . Our preliminary result past study demonstrate link ET-A receptor activation cytokine release tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) .13,14,30,38,39 Since TNF cause MMP induction , significant feed-forward mechanism may place cause persistent MMP release patient follow CPB . This directly address present study serially profile plasma collect subject aim # 1 2 ET , TNF MMPs use high sensitivity multiplex approach.40,41 Thus , biomarkers ET/TNF receptor activation relate MMP release entire post-operative course . The findings clinical research investigation establish first time , upstream signal mechanisms trigger proteolytic cascade contribute myocardial dysfunction within human myocardium . These finding identify potential therapeutic target set stage large , outcome base study .</detailed_description>
