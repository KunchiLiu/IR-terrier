	<brief_summary>Trauma continue major killer young Americans , mainly due hemorrhage brain injury . In trauma center , quarter severely injured patient arrive coagulopathy thereby experience increase risk death , despite current standard medical surgical management . The PI grant proposal fellowship-trained trauma surgeon work full-time Grady Memorial Hospital ( GMH ) , Level I Trauma Center Atlanta . It one four Level 1 trauma center entire state Georgia . This research direct extension retrospective research PI previously publish . Her retrospective research discover previously undescribed form coagulopathy , early trauma induce coagulopathy ( ETIC ) , explain present paradigm . Two civilian trauma article well military data Iraq war substantiate occurrence ETIC , prospective literature define kinetics . More importantly , result study represent new paradigm shift , ETIC appear primary dysfunction independently associate death . Therefore , early identification correction crucial mechanistic understanding , ultimately , choice intervention improve survival . GMH high-volume trauma center see patient variety injury mechanism , , therefore , perfect set confirm ETIC . First , project confirm prevalence ETIC observational prospective cohort injure patient . Data coagulation system risk factor , know suspected , patient collect upon patient arrival well patient outcome identify information protect . This first prospective research project allow simultaneous control confounders associate outcome thereby scientifically validate occurrence ETIC . One unique component data collection focus time event relate development consequence coagulopathy , account dynamic process . At completion data collection , match cohort ETIC non-ETIC blood sample test coagulation factor provide insight ETIC 's pathophysiology . In short term , conclusion assist u approach resuscitation bleed trauma patient trauma center already start change protocol base present incomplete understand trauma-induced coagulopathy . In addition , coagulation system data collect study lead pathophysiological answer refine hypothesis future research coagulation system level . Ultimately understanding ETIC lead effective , tailored treatment . Our main study hypothesis post-trauma coagulopathy primary dysfunction occur early traumatic event 25 % trauma patient triaged Trauma Center care .</brief_summary>
