	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine many infected mosquito bite require reliably give volunteer case malaria . It expect volunteer develop malaria may symptoms . Safety main concern . A malaria challenge give allow volunteer receive 1 , 3 , 5 mosquito 's bite . Then participants carefully follow blood test . The study also look immune system ( cell substance protect body infection foreign matter ) respond mosquito bite challenge . About 38 subject ( age 18-40 year ) great Baltimore , Maryland ( United States ) community participate may stay overnight 10 day local medical center . Procedures include medical screening , assignment dose group , mosquito bite challenge , 56 day follow-up . Volunteers contact telephone 6 12 month malaria challenge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Malaria Challenge With NF54 Strain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized trial aseptically raise anopheles mosquito malaria challenge . Adults age 18-40 year randomize one group 18 subject ( Part A ) second group 20 subject ( Part B ) . Adults randomize receive 1 , 3 5 bite Anopheles ( A . ) stephensi mosquito infect NF54 strain chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium ( P. ) falciparum . Part B inform result Part A . Thus , total approximately 38 adult receive malaria challenge . The challenge Part A give day 0 subsequent group ( Part B ) commence 56 day safety review . Solicited adverse event record day malaria challenge , outpatient day 5-7 , 19-28 , 35 , 42 , 49 , 56 post-challenge event . Inpatient analysis occur Days 8-18 three-day directly observe therapy P. falciparum infection complete . Additional outpatient , post-malaria infection follow-up occur weekly 4 week . Unsolicited adverse event record 56 day malaria challenge event . Participants receive telephone follow-up six twelve month enrollment . The primary objective develop evaluate safety tolerability new human malaria challenge model use aseptically-raised anopheles mosquito infect NF54 isolate P. falciparum rear current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMPs ) condition . Secondary objective obtain information minimum number A. stephensi bite require safely achieve 100 percent adult human volunteer infectivity ( Malaria challenge , Part A ) ; obtain information minimum quantity A. stephensi bite second challenge study achieve 100 percent adult human volunteer infectivity ( Malaria challenge , Part B ) ; develop molecular diagnostic technique rapid accurate real-time diagnosis P. falciparum infection assess role new diagnostic standard P. falciparum challenge study .</detailed_description>
