	<brief_title>Electrochemotherapy Chest Wall Recurrence af Breast Cancer : Present Challenges Future Prospects .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electrochemotherapy chest wall recurrence breast cancer . MD , Ph.D. student , Louise Wichmann Matthiessen , employ 2008 perform study . She plan complete train specialist clinical oncology subsequently , thus able follow work completion Ph.D . The study aim give palliation patient suffer painful , ulcerated metastasis chest wall situation treatment fail . Inclusion criterion : Chest wall recurrence breast cancer ; modality fail patient wish receive ( e.g . chemotherapy ) ; symptomatic relief need ; WHO performance status 0-2 ; normal coagulation parameter , normal kidney renal function ; write , informed consent . Lesions total 3 cm diameter . Patient recruitment : 28 patient recruit . Treatment : Patients treat general anesthesia ( inhale max . 30 % oxygen ) , standard dose bleomycin ( 15.000 IU/ m2 ) give intravenously . Electric pulse administer use square wave electroporator ( IGEA , Carpi , Italy ) . Needle plate electrode use order treat affect area efficiently . Eight pulse frequency 5 kHz use application electrode . In way , large area treat within short time . Post treatment , area cover dry dressing , standardly use . The patient see 2 , 4 , 8 week post treatment , re-treatment administer three time case area insufficiently treat first round . Lung function follow measurement DLCO ( carbon monoxide diffusion capacity ) . The patient furthermore follow 1 year treatment monthly interval , 1 year yearly basis 5 year . Evaluation : Evaluation perform ) measurement lesion extension digital photography , b ) development map system : Chest wall recurrence frequently confluent mass tumor vary depth . Precise map treatment area effect warrant . To end , system combine fix point ( e.g . small ink tattoo , use radiotherapy planning ) novel image technique use 3D computer tomography ( CT ) planning system employ radiotherapy , envisage . Furthermore , PET-Dual Time Point scan combine CT scan investigated treatment evaluation . Safety : Safety report term evaluation adverse event term patient satisfaction determine questionnaire , include 'Derriford Appearance Questionaire ' ( 18 ) .</detailed_description>
