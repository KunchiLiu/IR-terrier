	<brief_title>Early Experience With Descemet 's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A concurrent study retrospective well prospective case patient undergo DSAEK procedure indication corneal endothelial cell dysfunction . For retrospective study , case DSAEK procedure perform UT-Southwestern corneal edema secondary endothelial cell dysfunction consider . The clinical outcome surgery analyze correlate anterior segment image case . Statistical analysis perform data collect . And prospective arm trial , propose recruit 200 current patient case corneal edema second corneal endothelial cell dysfunction . These patient undergo ocular imaging study addition routine ocular exam perform surgery discretion investigational physician 6-month 12-month surgical treatment . Various image modality would include corneal topography , pentacam , anterior segment OCT , wavefront measurement Tandem Scanning Confocal Microscopy ( TSCM ) . The patient already DSAEK procedure do past undergo ocular examination well various image study post op follow visit . All modality routinely use standard care practice non-invasive . The data ocular examination various image technique pool analyzed end study order identify factor influence visual outcome . We believe help u learn interesting innovative technique time help u improve method order obtain good result future patient .</detailed_description>
