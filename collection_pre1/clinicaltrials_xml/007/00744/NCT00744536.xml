	<brief_summary>Angiogenesis increase high risk MDS patient proliferative CMML . Angiogenesis associate increase risk leukemic transformation poorer prognosis . Low dose chemotherapy may anti-angiogenic property targetting genetically stable endothelial cell . Lenalidomide recently show highly effective monotherapy low/low-intermediate risk MDS , particularly subgroup harbor 5q- deletion . Lenalidomide well study high risk MDS although report lenalidomide 's efficacy RAEB-T AML . One potential mode action lenalidomide inhibition angiogenesis . The investigator hypothesize combine lenalidomide low dose melphalan high risk MDS investigator effectively block angiogenesis achieve response hematologic improvement MDS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Revlimid® Low Dose Continuously Administered Melphalan Treat Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES : Primary : 1 . Determine overall response rate low dose melphalan use combination lenalidomide high risk MDS Secondary : 1 . Determine frequency hematologic improvement low dose melphalan use combination lenalidomide high risk MDS· 2 . Determine safety tolerability low dose melphalan use combination lenalidomide high risk MDS· 3 . Determine effect low dose melphalan use combination lenalidomide biomarkers angiogenesis high risk MDS· 4 . Determine frequency cytogenetic remission low dose melphalan use combination lenalidomide high risk MDS STUDY DESIGN : This study single center , open-label , non-randomized Phase II study . Patients high risk MDS include . This patient population define either high intermediate high risk IPSS score proliferative CMML symptomatic cytopenia hypersplenism ( IPSS score apply ) . If cytogenetics unavailable , patient transfusion dependent RAEB-1 eligible . This open label , single center non-randomized Phase II study melphalan 2 mg po lenalidomide , 10 mg po daily day 1 - 21 28 day cycle adult patient high risk MDS . Patients may continue receive drug maximum 12 month one follow occur : death ; disease progression ( definition , see appendix D ) ; intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment ; unacceptable adverse event ( ) ; patient decides withdraw study ; general specific change patient 's condition make patient unsuitable treatment , 4 cycle patient derive clinical benefit treatment judgment investigator . After 12 month , respond patient may continue oral lenalidomide alone daily ( dose tolerate patient ) 21 day 28 day cycle disease progression , toxicity death . Response treatment disease progression assess collect evaluate bone marrow aspirate within 10 day first dose cycle 3 5 every three cycle thereafter ( every 12 week ) confirmation complete response . Once confirm 1 month later , patient undergo bone marrow assessment evidence progression . Blood test include weekly CBC differential platelet count , electrolytes , BUN creatinine first 8 week , every 2 week stable dos , every 4 week thereafter clinically indicate . Liver profile measure monthly . Bone marrow biopsies/aspirates centrally review end study . Approximately 30 day receive last dose study drug , patient reassess toxicity , patient status relapse/progression applicable . Thereafter , patient re-assessed every 3 month death loss follow-up . Biomarkers angiogenesis measure following frequency : CECs CEPs baseline , monthly x 3 q 3 monthly x 2 time progression come study.Marrow peripheral blood soluble VEGF VEGFR-1 2 measure ELISA frequency bone marrows.Cytogenetics perform baseline , 3 month completion study . STUDY DURATION : 12 month lenalidomide + melphalan ; option remain lenalidomide alone ongoing response 12 month TOTAL SAMPLE SIZE : 20</detailed_description>
