	<detailed_description>The study shall conduct accord ISO 14155 . Results research study use assess performance safety System component . Data may combine similar research additional site create great understanding endpoint . Up sixty ( 60 ) patient ( include `` roll-in '' training patient ) enrol non-randomized study ass safety efficacy Ablation Frontiers Cardiac Ablation System . Further study may perform gather additional data regard safety efficacy system . Patients history symptomatic permanent AF , willing able sign inform consent , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , identify clinical investigator , enrol study . Comparative descriptive statistic use summarize patient outcome specify study endpoint .</detailed_description>
