	<brief_summary>Aims : This prospective trial seek investigate efficacy financial incentive increase uptake completion HBV vaccine series among people inject drug ( PWID ) . Using randomise control trial design , investigator offer 3 dose , accelerate HBV schedule eligible PWID allocate either standard care incentive condition . Participants allocate incentive condition receive small incentive payment second third dose vaccine . It hypothesize proportion participant complete vaccine series incentive payment arm high compare non-incentive payment arm ( standard care ) .</brief_summary>
