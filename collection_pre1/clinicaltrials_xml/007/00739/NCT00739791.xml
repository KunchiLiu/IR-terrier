	<brief_title>Nutrition Lifestyle Changes Patients With Previously Untreated Stage I Stage II Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To measure change gene expression prostate tissue core biopsy sample low-fat diet lifestyle intervention patient previously untreated stage I II adenocarcinoma prostate . - To collect health information patient enable well understand long term impact diet lifestyle change prostate cancer progression . OUTLINE : - Intervention phase : Patients place comprehensive lifestyle change program comprise low-fat vegan diet , stress management , moderate aerobic exercise , regular participation support group 3 month . - Follow-up phase : Patients undergo core tissue biopsy baseline 3 month genomic gene expression analysis . Insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) selenium-binding protein 1 level measure quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Patients also undergo blood sample collection periodically biomarker analysis , proteomic analysis , telomere length telomerase activity analysis measure quantitative PCR telomerase repeat amplification protocol ( TRAP ) . Blood urine sample also collect stored future analysis . Patients complete questionnaire baseline , 3 month , every 6-12 month 3 year assess dietary lifestyle behavior ( exercise , stress management practice , group support ) , quality life , psychological adjustment . Questionnaires include Semi-Quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire ; SF-36 Health Survey ; UCLA Prostate Cancer Index ; Impact Event Scale ; Memorial Anxiety Scale Prostate Cancer ; Post Traumatic Growth Inventory ; Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ; Received Social Support subscale Berlin Social Support Scale . Patients ' medical record review every 6-12 month 3 year collect information clinical event biomarkers ( e.g. , prostate-specific antigen Gleason score ) .</detailed_description>
