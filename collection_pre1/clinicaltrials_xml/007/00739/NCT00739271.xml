	<brief_summary>The concept start patient early enteral nutrition topic much interest research past decade . It gain widespread acceptance worldwide study conduct prove early enteral nutrition physiological , prevent morphologic functional trauma relate alteration gut modulate immune inflammatory response , less expensive total parenteral nutrition . Early enteral nutrition major component recently introduce post operative rehabilitative regimen . Early feed show reduce risk specific infection , mean length hospital stay , anastomotic dehiscence , wound infection , pneumonia , intra abdominal abscess . It lead low weight loss early positive nitrogen balance . Hence , overall early enteral nutrition lead reduce post operative morbidity well patient outcome . The objective study study compare effect early enteral feed conventional management patient undergo intestinal anastomosis ; end point return bowel activity , incidence septic complication , length hospital stay , weight loss post operative morbidity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre operatively , common parameter observe study control group : - Name - Age - Sex - Date admission - Weight - Indication surgery - Pre operative feature sepsis ( whether present ) include temperature , pulse rate &amp; total leukocyte count . Post operatively , patient study group keep nil per orally first forty eight hour . The nasogastric tube remove first post operative day invariably . After forty eight hour surgery , subject start sip clear liquid orally ; amount gradually increase tolerate patient . The diet step soft diet regular diet . A record make abdominal discomfort , pain distension experience subject feeding . Record make follow : - Site anastomosis - Type anastomosis ( suture / staple ) - Time removal nasogastric tube - Time passage flatus / stool post operatively - Time appearance bowel sound - Features sepsis included temperature , pulse rate &amp; total leukocyte count - Presence wound infection - Weight fifth day surgery , time discharge - Date discharge - Length hospital stay Patients control group keep maintenance intravenous fluid contain dextrose saline . Nasogastric tube remove feed start orally decide operating surgeon depend clinical condition patient presence bowel activity . Post operative record make parameter study group .</detailed_description>
