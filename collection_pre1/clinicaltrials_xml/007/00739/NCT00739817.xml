	<brief_summary>Background : Primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) rare genetic disease characterise recurrent respiratory infection subfertility due dysfunction cilium ( brush ) line cell . Undiagnosed untreated result irreversible crippling chronic lung disease . The diagnosis PCD difficult one involve complex assessment ciliary structure function . Thus , PCD diagnose appropriate preventative symptomatic treatment may deny many patient . In addition , gene responsible PCD present unknown , thus prevent pre-natal diagnosis genetic counseling . Working hypothesis aim : Recently , become apparent evaluation nasally expire nitric oxide ( NO ) constitute simple non-invasive diagnostic method , discriminate PCD patient , PCD carriers healthy control high rate specificity sensitivity . Testing simple last approximately one minute . We recently identify unique isolated Druze population high prevalence PCD . The high frequency disease place close community high risk undiagnosed PCD . The aim project use nasal NO measurement screen tool identify possible undiagnosed case PCD PCD carrier high risk Druze population .</brief_summary>
