	<brief_summary>In pilot study , Testing Strategies Weight Loss , test two different approach use financial incentive encourage weight loss . In first , build previous work show effectiveness 'deposit contract ' , subject give opportunity put money risk lose weight . In incentive condition , subject receive direct payment conditional daily weight loss , optional additional payment base contribution deposit contract . We match contribution 1:1 make option deposit money attractive predominantly low SES population . In second approach build prior work use lottery promote drug adherence . In incentive condition , participant enter daily lottery , receive payoff earn lottery stay track weight-loss goal . Given popularity general population , lottery hold promise provide cost-effective mean motivate weight loss making effort lose weight salient obese patient . Results trial indicate significantly high weight loss incentive arm trial control group . The low lose follow-up rate suggest approach provide daily feedback keep weight loss salient among participant feasible . Incentive participant complete study call daily weight average 95.8 % time . 17/19 ( 89.4 % ) subject deposited money deposit contract 14/17 participant make initial deposit either hold constant increased contribution month . Subjects incentive group lose significantly weight average subject control group ( 4.0 lb ) ( lottery 13.1 lb , p = 0.015 ; deposit contract 14.0 lb , p = 0.003 ) . Of subject lose follow-up two incentive arm ( 32 38 ) , lose weight . Based promising preliminary evidence supplemental funding Hewlett Foundation , propose 8-month study 2 intervention arm examine effect incentive long term weight loss success . This study build work date examine intervention successful promoting sustain weight loss . The propose 3-arm extension enroll 66 participant Philadelphia VA BMIs 30 40 , start potential participant place wait list previous study overwhelm response initial mailing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study , 3-arm randomize control trial ( RCT ) , would test 66 patient Philadelphia VA BMIs 30 40 . Participants control group would receive usual care provider monthly weigh in . Participants incentive condition receive daily monitoring weight 32 week , plus package financial incentive lose weight . Incentive group subject give weight loss target 24 lb first 24 week able choose weight loss goal 0 , 0.5 , 1 lb per week final two month study . Financial incentive first deposit contract condition consist potential payment every day target weight consist prorate daily amount deposit contract plus equal 1:1 match provide study team first 6 month frame 'weight loss period ' 2 month frame 'maintenance weight loss ' . In second deposit condition , incentive consist 8 month prorate daily amount deposit contract plus 1:1 match ( without frame 'weight loss ' vs 'maintenance weight loss ' ) . We 80 % power find 5 kg difference weight loss intervention control group . Subjects lose 20 pound either intervention group eligible additional incentive . The proposed intervention serve basis larger-scale intervention study incentive weight loss maintenance potential substantially reduce health burden obesity among veteran .</detailed_description>
