	<detailed_description>Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected patient routinely treat combination 3 4 drug ( highly active antiretroviral therapy [ HAART ] ) , reduce risk viral resistance development . Development new potent antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug urgently need prolong suppression viral replication patient infected HIV . This Phase I , open-label trial healthy woman investigate pharmacokinetic interaction combination ethinylestradiol norethindrone TMC278 25 mg daily . The trial aim allow recommendation regard concurrent use oral contraceptive TMC278 . The trial population consist 18 healthy woman stable oral contraceptive ( OC ) , specifically ethinylestradiol norethindrone , , currently use OC , willing start switch OC duration study . Healthy volunteer receive OC daily 21 day least 1 OC cycle prior Day 1 [ stabilize OC cycle Day -28 Day -1 ] . During second OC cycle [ Day 1 Day 28 ] , subject receive OC alone daily 21 day [ Treatment A ] . During third OC cycle [ Day 29 56 ] , subject receive OC daily 21 day addition TMC278 25 mg q.d . morning 15 day , start first day OC intake ( Day 29 ) [ Treatment B ] . Full 24-hour pharmacokinetic profile ethinylestradiol norethindrone determine first 2 week second OC cycle ( Treatment A : OC alone ; Day 15 ) first 2 week third OC cycle ( Treatment B : OC+TMC278 ; Day 43 ) . A full 24-hour pharmacokinetic profile TMC278 determine Day 43 . Blood sample day draw drug intake ( predose ) , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ( Day 43 ) , 6 , 9 , 12 , 16 ( Day 43 ) 24 hour postdose . Safety evaluation include evaluation adverse event , physical examination include vital sign , ECGs laboratory hematology biochemistry assessment . Healthy volunteer receive tablet ethinylestradiol norethindrone OC daily 21 day least 1 OC cycle prior Day 1 . During second OC cycle , healthy volunteer receive tablet ethinylestradiol norethindrone OC alone daily 21 day . During third OC cycle , healthy volunteer receive tablet ethinylestradiol norethindrone daily 21 day addition tablet TMC278 25 mg daily morning 15 day .</detailed_description>
