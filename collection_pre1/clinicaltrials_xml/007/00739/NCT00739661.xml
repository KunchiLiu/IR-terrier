	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis epithelial ovarian carcinoma , primary peritoneal carcinoma , fallopian tube carcinoma Must second third complete remission , receive chemotherapy ( platinumbased and/or nonplatinumbased ) recurrent disease , achieve complete remission recent chemotherapy regimen . Complete remission define symptom suggestive persistent cancer , compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest/abdomen/pelvis without evidence ovarian cancer within 4 week randomization , normal CA125 ( measure within 2 week randomization ) follow completion prior chemotherapy . The study investigator confirm status disease remission CT scan patient enrollment . If patient lymphadenopathy CT scan investigator think unlikely due ovarian cancer , patient consider eligible . If indicate , confirmatory biopsy perform . Patients must complete recent cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen ( platinumbased nonplatinum base ) less 3 week 14 week prior randomization . Archival tissue must available request . Negative pregnancy test Day 1 ( first day patient receive vismodegib placebo ) . For woman childbearing potential : Use two effective method contraception , include one barrier method . Pregnancy lactation . Patients whose ovarian cancer first remission .

Uncontrolled medical illness infection require intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic . Life expectancy &lt; 12 week . History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug might affect interpretation result study render patient high risk treatment complication .</criteria>
