	<brief_title>Visibility Site Marking Surgical Time Out With Two Different Skin Preparation Solutions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abstract : Skin preparation solution use clean skin patient surgery decrease rate infection . This particularly important hip replacement reduce risk prosthetic joint infection . The use mark skin site identification become standard care decrease wrong site surgery . The Joint Commission mandate site identification part surgical `` time-out '' . This procedure also mandate hospital policy . Preliminary work cadaveric skin show type skin preparation erase mark use surgical site identification . Erasure mark present surgeon difficulty perform site identification . Any error lack visualization site marking could lead catastrophic wrong site surgery . Our hypothesis chlorhexidine base skin preparation solution erase site mark comparison iodine base skin mark solution . We intend prospectively study twenty patient undergoing total hip arthroplasty determine site mark erase chlorhexidine base skin preparation solution compare iodine base skin preparation solution . This information critical surgeon must balance risk wound infection versus wrong site surgery . Study Procedures : We intend study twenty patient one orthopaedic surgeon ( SCM ) undergo total hip replacement supine position . Patients must English speak light skin color standardize contrast site mark . The study discuss patient clinic set surgical date . Patients randomize either use chlorhexidine base skin preparation solution ( Chloraprep® ( chlorhexidine gluconate 2 % w/v isopropyl alcohol 70 % v/v ; Enturia Inc. , Leawood , KS , USA ) ) , iodine base skin preparation solution ( Duraprep® ( Iodophor 0.7 % isopropyl alcohol 74 % w/w ; 3M Healthcare , St. Paul , MN , USA ) ) . Patients allergies either chlorhexidine iodine include study . These solution current gold standard clinical care routinely use Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center . No difference show infection rate total hip arthroplasty solution . The site mark perform surgeon standardized manner use standard marker supply hospital ( Sharpie Fine Point Permanent Marker , Sanford Corporation , Oak Brook , IL , USA ) . All marking make pre-operative hold area per usual routine . The site mark make next site incision anterior thigh . The site mark include surgeon 's three initial per usual routine . Underneath surgeon 's initial , three random initial place horizontal line draw underneath . Twenty random three-letter combination pre-generated use MS Excel® ( Microsoft Office 2003 , Microsoft Corporation , Seattle WA ) . After patient position prior skin preparation extra surgical time-out site identification perform . The preparation skin conduct accord manufacturer 's specification skin preparation solution . After skin preparation , solution allow dry patient drape . Prior apply impermeable drape skin , digital photograph take . Specimens photograph use digital still camera ( Digital Rebel XTi , Canon U.S.A. , Lake Success , NY ) 100-mm macro lens ( EF 100mm f/2.8 USM Macro Lens , Canon U.S.A. ) , ring flash ( MR-14EX TTL , Canon U.S.A ) . The camera capture data 10.1 megapixels set RAW mode . The shutter speed set 1/60s F-stop value 4.0 . The camera place fixed distance skin use tripod . After photography impervious drape place another surgical time-out performed . The surgeon , anesthesiologist nurse must agree surgical site must confirm consent form , patient record radiograph . The study make change clinic care patient besides use additional time-out extra initial photograph site marking . The surgical procedure alter way . Photographs three random initial de-identified . They crop use Adobe Photoshop CS2® ( Adobe , San Jose , CA ) three random initial horizontal line visible . The file identify study number . The file place digital presentation ( Powerpoint , Microsoft Office 2003 , Microsoft Corporation , Seattle , WA ) . Ten orthopaedic surgeon read site marking random order . The surgeon ask identify initial tell whether mark look appropriate perform surgical timeout . The horizontal line digitally analyze use Adobe Photoshop CS2® quantitatively measure mean gray level horizontal line use histogram tool . Regression analysis perform examine affect skin preparation solution ability surgeon correctly read initial ability identify site marking . Drugs/Substances/Devices : Two skin preparation solution use study . Both consider gold standard skin preparation routinely use Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center . These include : Chlorhexidine base skin preparation solution Chloraprep® ( chlorhexidine gluconate 2 % w/v isopropyl alcohol 70 % v/v ; Enturia Inc. , Leawood , KS , USA ) Iodine base skin preparation solution Duraprep® ( Iodophor 0.7 % isopropyl alcohol 74 % w/w ; 3M Healthcare , St. Paul , MN , USA ) Study Statistics : Primary Variables : Identification random initial review orthopaedic surgeon Judgment review orthopaedic surgeon site mark identifiable perform site identification The mean gray level horizontal line Risks : Surgical site infection : The skin preparation skin conduct use two standard skin preparation solution Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center . The preparation perform accord manufacturer 's direction skin preparation solution . The risk infection change study . This study mean investigate rate infection use two preparation solution . Wrong site surgery : The standard protocol site identification perform patient . The surgeon 's initial identify time-out procedure . The time perform nurse operating room accord protocol Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center . The nurse read consent form , confirm site identification mark surgeon anesthesiologist . The side confirm radiographs consent form procedure . The time perform two time prevent possibility wrong site surgery . This technique use neurosurgical service site mark difficult . The site identify skin preparation . Extra marking : The patient three extra initial one horizontal line draw underneath standard site marking . Site marking permanent marker take several week wash remove . All patient inform extra marking part study consent form . If patient want extra marking , include study . Confidentiality : The data study include digital photograph site marking . The photograph identify information label study number ( one twenty ) . All information study de-identified data pose confidentiality risk patient . Benefits : The benefit study give information removal site marking skin preparation solution . While risk wrong site surgery currently low , everything possible must do eliminate potential occurring . This study examine mark use total hip surgery ; risk wrong site surgery high surgery involve digit small area body . In area , mark must perfect . Any elimination mark could result catastrophe . If mark well visible partially erase , culture create mark ignore , create danger patient . If occur standard skin preparation solution either solution mark must change future . We hope study help eliminate potential wrong site surgery .</detailed_description>
