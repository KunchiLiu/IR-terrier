	<brief_title>IDO Inhibitor Study Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol provide early evaluation entirely new class small molecule agent direct disruption elimination tumor tolerance , phenomenon demonstrate involved growth many solid tumor . D-1MT , substance target enzymatic pathway indoleamine- ( 2,3 ) -dioxygenase ( IDO ) , use previously human . Although pre-clinical toxicology rat dog show extremely encouraging toxicity profile , study need carefully evaluate toxicity pharmacokinetics provide basis assign safe biologically effective dose regimen later trial determine contribution tumor response phase II III clinical trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A histological cytological diagnosis recurrent refractory solid tumor malignancy . The patient 's pathology must review confirmed prior enrollment ( outside review acceptable ) . If standard therapy exist disease subject refuse standard therapy , subject would consider eligible enrollment . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ≤ 2 . Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 gm/dL , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1200/mm3 , platelet ≥100,000/mm3 , absolute lymphocyte count ≥800/mm3 . Hepatic : serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN mg/dL , ALT ( SGPT ) AST ( SGOT ) ≤2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Renal : serum creatinine ( sCr ) ≤1.5 x ULN , creatinine clearance ( Ccr ) ≥50 mL/min ( approximation Cockcroft Gault accept ) Life expectancy great 4 month . Measurable nonmeasurable disease Normal EKG include benign variant abnormality associate condition currently respond appropriate care ( e.g. , control hypertension minimal moderate LVH , control AF ) . Prior therapy may include number chemotherapy , immunotherapy , and/or radiation therapy regimens . Major surgery systemic chemotherapy must complete least 4 week prior enrollment residual toxicity therapy must Grade 1 low time enrollment exception hemoglobin absolute granulocyte count . Localized radiation therapy must complete least 2 week prior enrollment residual toxicity must Grade 1 low time enrollment . Patients must ability understand study , inherent risk , side effect potential benefit able give write informed consent participate . Male female subject child produce potential must agree use contraception avoidance pregnancy measure enrol study receive experimental drug , one month last dose drug . Patients must least 18 year age Active CNS metastases carcinomatous meningitis . Patients CNS metastasis must least 3 month status post prior therapy brain steroid without progress CNS disease . Pregnant nursing woman due unknown effect study drug develop fetus newborn infant . History gastrointestinal disease cause malabsorption obstruction limit Crohn 's disease , celiac sprue , tropical sprue , bacterial overgrowth/blind loop syndrome , gastric bypass surgery , stricture , adhesion , achalasia , bowel obstruction , extensive small bowel resection . History organ transplant . Subjects autoimmune disease , either active history ( e.g. , systemic lupus erythematosis ( SLE ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , scleroderma , dermatomyositis , etc. ) . Subjects receive immunosuppressive therapy include systemic corticosteroid therapy and/other immunosuppressive therapy ( methotrexate , cyclosporine , FK506 , rapamycin ) reason . Subjects receive inhaled topical corticosteroid eligible . Significant uncontrolled cardiovascular disease include : uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure must ≤ 150/90 mmHg time enrollment stable antihypertensive regimen ) ; New York Heart Association grade II great congestive heart failure ( CHF ) ; grade II great peripheral vascular disease ; significant ventricular arrhythmia require medication ; myocardial infarction unstable angina &lt; six month prior enrollment . Active uncontrolled infection require antibiotic within 1week prior study , include unexplained fever ( temp &gt; 38.1°C &gt; 100.6°F ) . Any condition , psychiatric otherwise , would preclude informed consent , consistent followup compliance aspect study ( e.g. , untreated schizophrenia significant cognitive impairment , etc. ) . No supplement contain Ltrytophan derivative thereof allow take study . Patients positive serology HIV , Hepatitis B C , patient acquired/inherited immunodeficiency ineligible due possibility affect response D1MT high risk active opportunistic infection . Patients one active malignancy time enrollment .</criteria>
