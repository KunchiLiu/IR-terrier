On day CMR scan , electrocardiograms blood sample draw participant . Blood sample provide marker systemic inflammation , leukocyte count . At CMR scan , athlete ask describe recent history physical exertion questionnaire , reflect degree physical exertion perform . Image analysis : CMR parameter serve surrogate marker myocardial inflammation assess . Specifically , include STIR ( edema ) , early enhancement ( inflammation ) , late enhancement ( fibrosis ) . The presence 2 parameter indicate presence myocardial inflammation . Qualitative quantitative analysis perform image obtain CMR scan , assess offline use CMR42 ( Circle International , Calgary ) software . Standard method assess edema , inflammation , fibrosis implement . Standard leave ventricular function volume analysis technique implement ass leave ventricular dilatation .</detailed_description>
