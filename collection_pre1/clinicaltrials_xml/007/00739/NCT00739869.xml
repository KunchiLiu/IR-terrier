	<detailed_description>A silent stroke type stroke occur result blockage small blood vessel brain . Older adult , particular , risk silent stroke . This type stroke cause typical stroke symptom , vision problem , facial numbness , walk difficulty ; however , subtle change person 's cognitive ability memory may occur follow silent stroke . It important diagnose type stroke several occurrence silent stroke increase risk serious , possibly fatal , stroke . As woman go menopause , many choose take HRT relieve common menopausal symptom , include hot flash mood swing . Unfortunately , use HRT may place woman high risk experience silent stroke . This study ass whether woman take HRT , either estrogen alone estrogen progesterone combine , great risk silent stroke woman take HRT . Study researcher also examine change brain tissue change area brain associate thinking memory . This study enroll woman participate WHIMS study . Participants attend one study visit time brain MRI scan complete . Study researcher analyze participant ' study data WHIMS study Women 's Health Initiative Study Cognitive Aging ( WHISCA ) study , ancillary WHIMS study examine effect HRT memory cognition .</detailed_description>
