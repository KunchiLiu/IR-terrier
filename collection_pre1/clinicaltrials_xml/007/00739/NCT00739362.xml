	<brief_summary>This study determine whether electrical stimulation area brain call dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , important determine feeling fullness eating , affect much food person eats weight loss 4 week . It also compare weight change people attend weight loss counseling session period time . Obese , non-diabetic people 18 60 year age good health live Phoenix , AZ , metropolitan area eligible study . Candidates must body mass index 35 kg/m ( 2 ) weigh le 350 pound . Participants admit NIH inpatient unit Phoenix first 9 day study test , include meal test determine eat behavior caloric intake , blood urine test , glucose tolerance test , weight measurement , psychological assessment DEXA scan measure body fat . For 3 day , ask eat food automate vend machine . Some subject receive transcranial direct current stimulation ( TDCS ) . For procedure , electrodes conduct electricity place head arm current turn 40 minute . Some tingling may felt electrode . Other subject receive sham TDCS , current turn briefly . After evaluation , subject discharge home NIH unit instruct eat 25 percent few calorie consume weight maintenance diet first 3 day inpatient stay . They maintain low calorie diet home 4 week . During period come NIH unit 3 day week receive either real sham TDCS . Some subject also assign receive weight loss counseling session twice week , others . At end 4 week , subject return NIH unit 5-day stay undergo repeat DEXA scan , meal test , psychological assessment blood test , eat another 3 day vend machine . At completion study , participant may choose receive 4 week TDCS behavioral weight loss counseling , .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study brain function examine area relate hunger fullness , part brain call leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) find less active obese versus lean individual follow meal . Furthermore , woman lose maintained weight loss , activity area follow meal similar lean woman , suggest activity area may improve weight loss . Two recent study demonstrate lack increase food crave follow non-invasive brain stimulation leave DLPFC compare sham control group receive brain stimulation . The aim protocol investigate effectiveness one type noninvasive brain stimulation technique , transcranial direct current stimulation ( TDCS ) food intake significantly overweight ( BMI &gt; 30 kg/m ( 2 ) individual . In study 1 , enroll individual previously participate study compare anodal ( active ) stimulation sham ( stimulation ) leave DLPFC compare previous stimulation condition term weight loss food intake . The aim Study 2 compare active versus sham anodal LDLPFC stimulation new group volunteer . Study 2 double-blind parallel study volunteer randomize receive either active TDCS stimulation ( sham ) leave DLPFC . During 4-week outpatient period , group ask consume diet 25 % reduction calculate weight maintenance calorie come Unit 3x per week stimulation session . The primary outcome measurement total food intake 3-d ad libitum intake computerized vending machine system , weight loss 4-week outpatient period . In study 1 also examine appetitive hormone behavioral factor , might also mediate potential change food intake weight loss follow TDCS leave DLPFC . Positive finding study could demonstrate utility novel safe treatment severe obesity . Future study could include long clinical trial TDCS extend follow-up duration .</detailed_description>
