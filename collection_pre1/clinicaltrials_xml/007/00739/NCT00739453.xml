	<brief_summary>Multicenter , open-label , phase 1 , cohort dose escalation study determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) OSI-906 combination erlotinib</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Dose-escalation Study OSI-906 Erlotinib ( TarcevaÂ® )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study open Schedule 1 ( S1 ) , OSI-906 administer Days 1-3 every 7 day . Erlotinib administer daily start Day 2 . A treatment period define 21 day . Initiation Schedule 2 ( S2 ) , OSI-906 administer daily start Day 1 erlotinib administer daily start Day 2 , occur observation clinically significant related toxicity &gt; /= grade 2 patient S1 &gt; 2 dose level S1 examine without evidence Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLT ) . Initiation Schedule 3 ( S3 ) , OSI-906 administer twice daily start Day 1 erlotinib administer daily start Day 2 , occur observation clinically significant related toxicity &gt; /= grade 2 patient S2 &gt; 2 dose level S2 examine without evidence DLT . Once phase 2 dose establish S3 , 1 expansion cohort open . The Expansion Cohort enroll approximately 30 evaluable patient stage IIIB/IV Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma ( NSCLC ) . Patients NSCLC Expansion Cohort require either archival tissue fresh tumor tissue available start study .</detailed_description>
