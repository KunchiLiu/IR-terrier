	<brief_summary>Blood pressure cuff ( NIBP ) slowly replace intra-arterial ( IABP ) measurement standard care medical intensive care unit . There little data support clinical normalization deviance . This study aim correlate NIBP IABP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It become standard practice inpatient intensive care setting monitor systolic , diastolic mean arterial blood pressure oscillometric technique . Several study confirm accuracy precision oscillometric technique ambulatory patient level brachial radial artery . Multiple clinical research study demonstrate blood pressure ( systolic , diastolic mean arterial pressure ) determine non-invasive blood pressure monitor ( NIBP ) various manufacturer compare direct invasive arterial pressure monitor , two value average within 5 mm Hg . There limited data critically ill patient . To date , study evaluate accuracy precision device intensive care patient alternative site ( calf , thigh ) . In addition , large clinical study evaluate oscillometric NIBP monitoring complex medical intensive care population vary hemodynamics . The goal study validate oscillometric technique measurement blood pressure calf thigh region compare gold standard . We may also able evaluate specifically situation patient population blood pressure accurately portray compare arterial pressure trace . It possible clinical value either validate non-invasive blood pressure monitor eliminating/decreasing need invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring . Our hypothesis NIBP medical intensive care patient highly variable reliable mean arterial blood pressure monitoring .</detailed_description>
