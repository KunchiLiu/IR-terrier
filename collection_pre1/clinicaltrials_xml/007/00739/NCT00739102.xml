	<criteria>Age &gt; /= 30 year For woman child bear potential , pregnancy test within 7 day prior index procedure ( test result must negative eligible ) . Symptomatic leg ischemia Rutherford/Becker Classification ( category 2 , 3 4 ) rest exercise ABI &lt; /= 0.8 . A single superficial femoral artery lesion &gt; 50 % stenosis total occlusion . Stenotic lesion occlude length within vessel ( one long multiple serial lesion ) &gt; /= 4.0 cm &lt; /= 15.0 cm , visual estimate . The stenosis must treatable two stent , minimize stent overlap whose combined length &lt; /= 170 mm . Reference vessel diameter ( RVD ) &gt; /= 4.0 mm &lt; /= 6.0 mm visual assessment . All lesion locate least three centimeter proximal superior edge patella . Patent infrapopliteal popliteal artery , i.e. , single vessel runoff well least one three vessel patent ( &lt; 50 % stenosis ) ankle foot . The guidewire across target lesion ( ) locate intraluminally within distal vessel . Poor aortoiliac common femoral `` inflow '' ( i.e . angiographically define &gt; 50 % stenosis iliac common femoral artery ) would deem inadequate support femoropopliteal bypass graft must successfully treat prior treatment target lesion . This do prior treatment target lesion . Successful treatment define &lt; 30 % stenosis either PTA stenting inflow lesion . After treatment inflow lesion , peak peak pressure gradient across inflow lesion &lt; /= 20mmHg peak peak pressure gradient across SFA target lesion &gt; /= 20mmHg , patient include study . A patient bilateral obstructive SFA disease eligible enrollment study . Eligibility standard surgical repair , necessary . A patient require coronary intervention , perform least 7 day prior treatment target lesion . Patient authorize representative must provide write informed consent write HIPAA authorization prior initiation study procedure . Patient must willing comply specify followup evaluation schedule . Thrombophlebitis , uremia , deep venous thrombus , within past 30 day . Receiving dialysis immunosuppressant therapy . Thrombolysis target vessel within 72 hour prior index procedure complete resolution thrombus achieve . Recent stroke within past 90 day . Femoral , iliac aortic aneurysm aneurysm SFA popliteal artery within past 5 year . Required stent placement via popliteal approach . Required stent placement across within 0.5 cm SFA / PFA bifurcation . Procedures predetermine require stentinstent placement obtain patency , severe calcification resistant stenting , instent restenosis . Significant vessel tortuosity parameter prohibit access lesion 90° tortuosity would prevent delivery stent device . Previously deploy stent within SFA target limb . Known allergy follow : aspirin , clopidogrel bisulfate ( Plavix® ) ticlopidine ( Ticlid® ) , heparin , Nitinol ( nickel titanium ) , contrast agent , medically manage . Presence thrombus prior cross lesion Tissue loss due ischemic disease ( Rutherford/Becker category 5 6 ) Serum creatinine level &gt; /= 2.5 mg/dl time screen visit Known suspect active infection time procedure Bleeding diathesis Presence aortic , iliac femoral artificial graft Life expectancy less one year , factor prevent clinical followup . Use cryoplasty , laser , atherectomy device target vessel time index procedure Instent restenotic lesion time procedure . Restenotic lesion previously treat atherectomy , laser , cryoplasty within 90 day index procedure . Patient unwilling unable comply procedure specify protocol difficulty inability return followup visit specify protocol . Patient know pregnant , incarcerated , mentally incompetent , and/or alcohol drug abuser . Patient currently participate investigational drug medical device study complete primary endpoint ( ) evaluation clinically interfere endpoint study future participation study prior completion study . Patient major surgical interventional procedure unrelated study within 30 day prior study planned surgical interventional procedure within 30 day entry study . Interventional procedure perform ipsilateral iliac artery provide access allow .</criteria>
