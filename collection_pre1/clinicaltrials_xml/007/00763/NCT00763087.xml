	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine people Diabetes Mellitus peripheral neuropathy increase activity ( i.e . walk stationary biking ) leg strength without increase foot problem compare group people diabetes peripheral neuropathy exercise . Our hypothesis weight-bearing exercise group achieve great increase weight-bearing activity ( i.e. , increased steps/day cumulative load ) leg strength compare non-weight bearing exercise group non-exercising control group ; clinically meaningful difference incidence indicator foot lesion group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Weight-Bearing Exercise People With Diabetes Neuropathic Feet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People diabetes peripheral neuropathy ( DM+PN ) substantial low extremity impairment , functional limitation disability . In addition muscle weakness poor balance , also high risk foot ulceration , especially history ulceration . Although large grow body knowledge effect exercise people DM , little evidence effect exercise people DM+PN . Exercise important treatment component help control complication DM . The American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) , American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) 4 recommend adult DM participate least 30 minute day moderate-intensity physical activity consistent brisk walk . The ADA ACSM , however , discourage weight-bearing exercise people DM+PN due risk exercise-induced foot injury . No data support guideline restrict DM+PN weight-bearing activity , fact , evidence suggest DM+PN active least likely develop skin breakdown . The Primary Goal proposal conduct pilot randomize prospective control clinical trial determine people DM+PN benefit progressive weight-bearing exercise program improve impairment , functional limitation , disability , pathophysiology without increase skin breakdown foot lesion . The benefit weight bear program compare benefit non weight bear exercise program non-exercising control group . The result study also help determine neuropathic skin muscle adapt increase physical stress level without injury could important implication weight-bearing exercise guideline people DM+PN . A . SPECIFIC AIMS Aim 1 . Determine effect weight-bearing exercise program compare non-weight bearing exercise program non-exercising control group indicator impairment , functional limitation , disability , pathophysiology patient DM+PN . 1 . Measures Impairment : Ankle joint range motion , ankle plantar flexor dorsiflexor muscle strength ( peak torque ) , muscle volume ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , stand balance . H1 : Both exercise group show improvement ankle joint range motion ankle plantar flexor / dorsiflexor muscle strength / volume compare non-exercising control group , weight-bearing exercise group show improvement stand balance exposure challenge weight-bearing activity . 2 . Measures Functional Limitations : Physical Performance Test , Foot &amp; Ankle Ability Measure . H2 : Both exercise group show improvement Physical Performance Test Foot &amp; Ankle Ability Measure compare non-exercising control group , weight-bearing exercise group show great improvement non-weight bearing exercise group improve balance exposure challenge weight-bearing activity . 3 . Measures Disability / Participation : Diabetes Symptom Checklist , Beck Depression Inventory . H3 : Both exercise group show improved measure disability compare non-exercising control group , weight-bearing exercise group show great improvement non-weight bearing exercise group improve ability participate community activity require weight-bearing walking ability . 4 . Measures Pathophysiology : HbA1c , serum lipid , DXA ( body composition ) , body mass index . H4 : Both exercise group show modest statistically significant improvement compare non-exercising control group measure pathophysiology . Aim 2 : Determine effect weight-bearing exercise program non-weight bearing exercise program compare control group 1 ) daily step count ( steps/day ) , 2 ) estimate cumulative load ( step count * plantar pressure integral ) , 3 ) unilateral increase surface foot temperature , 4 ) incidence foot lesion ( digital photograph ) . H5 : The weight-bearing exercise group achieve great increase weight-bearing activity ( i.e. , increased steps/day cumulative load ) compare non-weight bearing exercise group non-exercising control group ; clinically meaningful difference incidence indicator foot lesion group .</detailed_description>
