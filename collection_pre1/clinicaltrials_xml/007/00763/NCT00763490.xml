	<brief_summary>This pilot research study investigate safety effectiveness stem cell transplantation treat blood-related ( hematopoietic ) cancer , use stem cell collect two different , umbilical cord blood donor . Subjects study receive stem cell transplant treatment fail disease unlikely respond treatment option . Blood-related cancer treat sometimes cure high dos chemotherapy radiation therapy , give kill cancer cell ; however , treatment prove unsuccessful harm normal cell bone marrow patient 's disease may unlikely respond treatment option . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) potential cure , opportunity perform HSCT limit donor availability . Only 20-30 % patient may match family donor . In case , mismatch family donor may suitable . For patient need transplant suitably match family donor , blood stem cell match unrelated donor use . The length time require identify match unrelated donor present another obstacle patient wait receive HSCT . Blood stem cell find umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) , blood leave placenta ( afterbirth ) baby bear . Usually blood discard placenta , past 15 year , learn collect freeze cord blood cell use transplant late time . A cord blood unit cord blood cell collect store single placenta . More 6,500 umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant do worldwide , mostly child leukemia . One important factor affect success cord blood transplant cell dose ( number stem cell cord blood unit / recipient 's weight ) . Patients receive high cell dose ( &gt; 2.5 x 107 cells/kilogram ) good marrow recovery high rate survival receive low cell dose . In attempt make UCB transplantation possible big child , adolescent adult , researcher try give two cord blood unit day transplant , one . The data 150 `` double cord blood '' transplant adults suggest `` double cord blood '' transplant may allow bone marrow recovery survival patient single cord blood unit enough cell successful transplantation . This pilot study research safety effectiveness use two UCB unit adult pediatric UCB transplantation combine condition regimen call Flu/Bu4/TLI ( consist fludarabine , busulfan total lymphoid irradiation ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The candidate must incurable hematological malignancy nonmalignant hematological disorder eligible transplant University Michigan program . The candidate must life expectancy le one year without transplantation . The candidate must two partially HLAmatched UCB ( cord blood ) units.Units must HLAmatched minimally 4 6 HLAA B ( intermediate resolution molecular typing ) DRB1 ( high resolution molecular typing ) locus . Units must HLAmatched 3 6 HLA A , B , DRB1 locus ( use resolution molecular typing indicate ) . The candidate must access two appropriately HLAmatched unit available one unit deliver precryopreserved nucleated cell dose least 2.5 x 107 per kilogram second unit least 2.0 x 107 per kilogram . The candidate adult pediatric patient suitable relate unrelated donor available transplant . Suitable donor include 8/8 ( HLAA , B , C DR , loci highresolution type ) 7/8 relate unrelated donor available within 42 day search initiation . The candidate Karnofsky ( Adult ) Lansky ( Pediatrics ) performance status &lt; 70 % time admission HSCT . The candidate patient evidence HIV infection . The candidate patient active bacterial , fungal viral infection respond treatment . Nonresponse treatment determine body temperature , blood culture result , radiographic finding applicable . The candidate pregnant . The candidate medical comorbidities/conditions , opinion transplant team , would keep patient comply need protocol and/or would markedly increase morbidity mortality procedure . The candidate condition , opinion transplant team , substance abuse , severe personality disorder would keep patient comply need protocol would markedly increase morbidity mortality procedure .</criteria>
