	<brief_summary>Depression common illness approximate lifetime prevalence 17 % , confer large burden disease community , often due inadequate treatment . Thus interest therapeutic potential non invasive , novel form brain stimulation , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . Two small study publish last two year indicate 20 minute either 1 2mA tDCS 5 10 session safe , painless well tolerate . The investigator ' pilot data ( N=30 ) also suggest technique antidepressant effect safe ( 5-10 session tDCS 1 mA ) . This study extend previous finding , test definitive tDCS approach ( also leave prefrontal anodal stimulation ) longer treatment course ( 15 session ) , 2 mA ( find safe effective 1 mA cognitive study ) , large sample ( N=68 ) , use placebo-controlled design . It hypothesise active tDCS ( 15 session ) great efficacy sham treatment ( 15 session ) reduce severity depressive symptom patient episode major depression . A second hypothesis 15 session tDCS cause significant adverse effect cause decline neuropsychological functioning comparison sham control .</brief_summary>
