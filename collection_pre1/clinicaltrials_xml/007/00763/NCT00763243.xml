	<brief_title>Pilot Study Feasibility Efficacy Working Memory Training Children With Cochlear Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term goal research program improve speech-language outcome prelingually deaf child receive CIs . The objective proposal investigate short-term effect novel work memory train program memory , learn , speech-language outcome child CIs . The specific hypothesis project completion behaviorally-based training program design increase work memory capacity improve attention , work memory span , work memory-related speech-language processing group deaf child CIs . This hypothesis base past research demonstrate efficacy work memory training program improve attention work memory child attention deficit , well past research show association work memory speech-language outcome child CIs . Knowledge effect work memory train CI speech-language outcome provide good understand process child CIs learn speech-language follow implantation may offer entirely new avenue intervention improve speech-language outcome , particularly deaf child show limited improvement follow implantation . The specific aim study : 1 . Specific Aim 1 : Determine feasibility application novel , computer-based work memory train program apply child CIs . We hypothesize child CIs show progression learn auditory visual work memory train program mirror normal-hearing child . 2 . Specific Aim 2 : Determine effect work memory train program core attention , concentration , work memory process child CIs . We hypothesize child CIs show improvement laboratory-based parent-report measure attention , concentration , work memory process work memory training , compare baseline period . 3 . Specific Aim 3 : Determine effect work memory train program work memory-related speech-language outcome measure child CIs . We hypothesize child CIs show improvement auditory work memory , verbal naming fluency , word repetition training .</detailed_description>
