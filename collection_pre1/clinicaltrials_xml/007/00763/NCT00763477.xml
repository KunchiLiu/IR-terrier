	<brief_summary>Background ghrelin Ghrelin naturally occur hormone find blood stimulates appetite . In healthy individual , level ghrelin high meal fall afterwards . Previous study show give ghrelin ( injection ) thin patient renal failure cancer increase food intake . Furthermore , addition ghrelin may also reduce inflammation within body . Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) genetic disease frequently result recurrent lung infection ( lead progressive inflammatory lung damage ) low body weight . Low body weight CF associate increase lung infection , rapidly worsen lung function shorten life expectancy . The researcher postulate administration extra ghrelin CF patient low body weight may increase food intake reduce lung inflammation . If successful , study might identify ghrelin potential therapy CF patient improve nutrition , decrease lung inflammation thereby improve survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate role naturally occur hormone call ghrelin appetite , energy expenditure immune function patient cystic fibrosis . Theoretical framework : Despite advance molecular understanding disease , life−expectancy Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) remain severely limited . Reduced body−weight associate increased inflammatory lung damage major predictor mortality CF patient . Malnutrition highly prevalent CF population result poor food intake excessive energy expenditure . A therapy improve nutrition may therefore significant effect prognosis disease . Ghrelin physiological circulating factor know increase food intake . Administration acylated ghrelin human increase hunger food intake find increase appetite chronic disease state associate anorexia weight loss ( cancer chronic renal disease ) . From multiple animal vitro human study , ghrelin also appear anti−inflammatory property would potentially benefit CF patient chronic inflammatory state promotes lung destruction , malnutrition increase mortality . Ghrelin replacement may therefore improve nutrition decrease inflammatory burden CF patient , lead improvement life−expectancy . If ghrelin identify important pathophysiological role CF may lead future study efficacy therapeutic agent . Design Methodology : The study three section : 1. cross sectional study level blood metabolic signal participant cystic fibrosis healthy control . 2. laboratory study effect ghrelin immune cell extract blood participant cystic fibrosis healthy control 3. cross−over interventional study repeat ghrelin administration malnourish cystic fibrosis patient</detailed_description>
