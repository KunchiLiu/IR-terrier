	<brief_summary>Chronic posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) debilitate disorder treatment response pharmacological intervention modest patient . Chronic elevate anxiety associate psychophysiological parameter include increased heart rate alteration skin conductance key symptom chronic PTSD . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SRIs ) consider treatment first choice patient , however substantial portion patient treat SRIs respond sufficiently . Therefore , need establish novel effective treatment strategy patient . Recently , duloxetine receive considerable attention since show multiple control trial effective treatment people major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , condition often co-morbid PTSD . In chronic PTSD , psychophysiological response baseline response treatment duloxetine inadequately study may provide novel insight antidepressant anxiolytic mechanism compound . Primary Aim 1 : Evaluate anxiolytic antidepressant effect duloxetine patient chronic PTSD . Secondary Aim 2 : Evaluate effect duloxetine fear condition psychophysiological response ( include startle eyeblink , skin conductance , cardiovascular inter-beat interval ) baseline 8 week naturalistic treatment chronic PTSD patient .</brief_summary>
