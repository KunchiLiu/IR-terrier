	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study consciously sedate patient suffer ST-elevation myocardial infarction rapidly safely cooled state therapeutic hypothermia ( 32 34 degree C ) use LRS ThermoSuit System prior percutaneous coronary intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Hypothermia Incorporated Into Primary Angioplasty Heart Attack ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical study investigate safety feasibility cool heart attack ( STEMI ) patient LRS ( Life Recovery Systems ) ThermoSuit System , cool device use principle cold water immersion rapidly reduce patient temperature . The study enroll total 20 patient , cooperative effort LRS LSU Health Sciences Center - Shreveport . The study conduct IDE ( Investigational Device Exemption ) grant LRS FDA ( G070141 ) . The primary goal trial demonstrate feasibility cool AMI patient pre-reperfusion ThermoSuit cooling device . The safety treatment determine review composite serious adverse event . Consciously sedated patient cool entry emergency room prior percutaneous coronary intervention catheterization laboratory . It hypothesize ThermoSuit System enable cool patient 34ºC treatment 30 minute less . Previous research suggest cool ST-elevation myocardial infarction patient coronary reperfusion could result significant reduction myocardial infarct size . If successful , study lead pivotal clinical study investigate potential ThermoSuit cooling treatment reduce myocardial infarct size . The ultimate goal study determine safety effectiveness use ThermoSuit device treatment AMI patient .</detailed_description>
