Study participant include Veterans hospitalize Stage III/IV PrUs level injury , six VA SCI Centers around country ( Long Beach , Houston , Milwaukee , Augusta , Hines St. Louis ) . Prior discharge , PrU risk factor identify 1:1 PrU education provide . Randomization behavioral intervention begin discharge . The number randomize subject 72 ED group 72 SM group ( n=144 ) . The analytic sample include subject complete data ( n=92 ) . The intervention include 8 site coordinator-initiated call use didactic ( ED ) Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) strategies address PrU risk factor .
