	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine impact chemotherapy ability surgeon completely remove cancer well impact survival . Furthermore investigator assess side effect chemotherapy strategy . Finally investigator determine ability specialize image technology ( PET scan ) document predict response tumor chemotherapy . Standard therapy patient condition usually consist surgery ( removal tumor ) follow combination chemotherapy radiotherapy . More recently , standard option available patient cancer stomach low esophagus expand include chemotherapy without radiotherapy prior follow surgery . While believe chemotherapy prior surgery good option patient stomach , know optimal chemotherapy regimen offer patient prior surgery improve likelihood cure limit side-effects patient .</brief_summary>
