	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study SYR-619 Treating Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There approximately 19 million people United States diagnose diabetes mellitus , 90 % 95 % type 2 . The prevalence type 2 diabetes varies among racial ethnic population show correlate age , obesity , family history , history gestational diabetes , physical inactivity . Over next decade , mark increase number adult diabetes mellitus expect , place ever increase burden family health care system . SYR-619 inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme . Dipeptidyl peptidase IV think primarily responsible vivo degradation 2 peptide hormone release response nutrient ingestion , namely glucagon-like peptide-1 glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide . The aim study evaluate dose-response efficacy , safety tolerability treatment SYR-619 subject type 2 diabetes previously achieve adequate glycemic control lifestyle modification ( diet/exercise ) metformin sulfonylurea oral antidiabetic monotherapy . Individuals want participate study require provide write informed consent . Study participation anticipate 14 Weeks . Multiple procedures occur visit may include fasting , blood collection , urine collection , vital sign include sit stand blood pressure pulse , body height weight , physical examination , electrocardiogram .</detailed_description>
