	<detailed_description>RA autoimmune disease cause long-term inflammation joint sometimes body tissue , . Recent study find increase prevalence coronary artery atherosclerosis , metabolic syndrome , insulin resistance among people RA . Furthermore , insulin resistance , lead hyperinsulinemia—too much insulin blood—has associate RA disease activity severity coronary artery atherosclerosis . These correlation suggest inflammation hyperinsulinemia somehow interact facilitate one another . Pioglitazone prescription drug reduces insulin resistance currently use treat people diabetes . This study determine whether pioglitazone also use effectively treat people RA . Specifically , study evaluate effect pioglitazone inflammation , insulin resistance , atherosclerosis . Participation study last 20 week . At initial 1-hour screening , participant undergo physical examination , medical history review , blood sampling , , female , urine pregnancy test . Eligible participant return first six monthly study visit . At first visit , participant randomly assign receive either pioglitazone placebo , take daily 8 week . This follow 4-week wash-out period , study treatment take . Then , Week 12 , participant begin daily treatment whatever assign originally . This second treatment phase also last 8 week . All study visit involve test procedure . The morning study visit , participant collect urine jug , bring clinic . Participants undergo blood sampling , blood pressure measurement , artery stiffness measurement . During study visit Weeks 4 , 8 , 16 , 20 , participant ask report symptom , pain , adverse effect .</detailed_description>
