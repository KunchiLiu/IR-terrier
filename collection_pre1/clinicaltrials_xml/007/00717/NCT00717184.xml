	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Autologous Ex Vivo Activated NK Cell Infusion Treatment Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We investigate use immune cell therapy metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer ( NPC ) . Recent small study show EBV specific cytotoxic T cell infuse NPC patient good clinical effect include tumor response . We try achieve similar result use less complex less costly approach , Natural Killer ( NK ) cell . NK cell know recognize tumor virally infected cell variety mechanism . Also , NK cell influence development antigen-specific T cell response via reciprocal interaction dendritic cell secretion IFNγ . This pilot clinical trial study feasibility collecting , manipulating , infuse autologous enrich NK cell activate short-term incubation IL-2 . Leukapheresis unit collect eligible patient NPC . NK cell select activate IL-2 prior re-infusion . Patients receive low dose IL-2 infusion activate NK cell . Post infusion monitor include peripheral blood T cell subset , cytokine secretion serum cytokine level . The parameter correlate clinical observation . If clinical efficacy show , protocol could represent simple way harness immune system patient treatment disease . This study also serve platform technology development later trial involve manipulate cell therapy product .</detailed_description>

Patients must least one site measurable disease . Sites measurable disease irradiate use great 60 day pass completion radiation treatment start NK cell treatment . Patients active infection require oral intravenous antibiotic eligible entry onto study resolution infection . History HIV infection , chronic active Hepatitis B C. Patients prior currently active autoimmune disease require management systemic immunosuppression eligible . Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease require daily systemic corticosteroid acceptable . Enrollment another experimental treatment within 28 day start treatment study . Systemic steroid within 28 day start study treatment . Uncontrolled medical problem .</criteria>
