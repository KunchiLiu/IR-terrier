	<detailed_description>Germline polymorphism inherit genetic variation present cell body . At molecular level , variation may affect gene transcription , translation , mRNA stability , protein activity , protein expression ( 1-3 ) . Mounting evidence emerge show genetic polymorphism drug metabolize gene DNA repair gene major determinant response drug carcinogens possible predictive prognostic value clinical outcome ( 4-6 ) . However , small number polymorphism discover functional significance often difficult predict base nucleotide sequence alone . Genome base study generate wealth data genetic polymorphism far exceed knowledge function variant . Hence , urgent need characterize functional expressional impact genetic polymorphism candidate gene appropriate target polymorphism likely affect phenotype select large scale association study . In study , adopt novel 2-stage approach identify characterize new polymorphism UGT1A6 2B7 gene Asian population . Data initial genotyping work use optimize study design stage II association study generation hypothesis lung cancer histology ( phenotype ) associate UGT polymorphism ( genotype ) . This study help advance understanding functional significance diversity genetic variant exist population . It may also shed light role UGT carcinogenesis provide vital ground work future study risk assessment , treatment may allow identification risk individual chemoprevention adjuvant therapy study .</detailed_description>
