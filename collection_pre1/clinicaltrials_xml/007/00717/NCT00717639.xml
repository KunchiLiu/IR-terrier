	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate diagnostic accuracy magnetic resonance angiography use contrast agent Vasovist® detection relevant vascular narrow low extremity . Patients schedule intra-arterial conventional angiography eligible trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vasovist Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients include study either MRA extracellular contrast agent , compute tomography angiography , ultrasound i.a . DSA perform beforehand patient schedule i.a . DSA perform . Vasovist® enhance MRA image perform use state-of-the-art 1.5T MR system . Recruitment , baseline examination , Vasovist®-enhanced MRA vessel segment interest follow-up examination perform 8 radiological clinic Europe . The safety follow-up period least 12 hour 24 hour post injection Vasovist® include assessment physical examination vital sign well assessment AEs . DSA must carry least 12 hour Vasovist® administration last follow-up visit perform .</detailed_description>
