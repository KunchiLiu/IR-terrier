	<brief_summary>This study open randomize controlled trial 12-month duration , compare use home blood pressure ( BP ) tele-management system usual approach home BP monitoring old diabetic patient uncontrolled systolic hypertension . The purpose study determine whether home blood pressure tele-management system markedly improve blood pressure control primary care setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypertension major risk factor renal cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . While health benefit lower blood pressure ( BP ) well document , population survey consistently find less quarter hypertensive patient BP good control . Self-monitoring BP home extensively evaluate potentially useful tool improve BP control medication adherence hypertensive patient . We develop user-centric home BP tele-management system . The system capture home self-measured BP reading require patient set jointly physician BP treatment goal , home BP monitoring schedule BP alert level . The system track frequency , date time home reading , generates message patient report physician indicate whether BP treatment goal reach , send BP alert adherence reminder BP reading patient clinical BP alert report physician . Using open , randomize control parallel group trial design , old diabetic patient uncontrolled systolic hypertension , recruit practice primary care physician , receive either usual care approach home BP monitoring care incorporate use home BP tele-management system . The primary outcome measure change mean daytime systolic BP baseline last ( 12-month ) visit 24-hour ambulatory . The secondary objective examine psychosocial factor may make difficult patient monitor blood pressure home . The rationale include psychological component study critical component system adherence self-monitoring . While adherence automatically determine telemanagement system , determinant adherence behaviour adequately assessed literature . To gain insight aspect health behaviour measure psychological predictor use quantitative qualitative technique . Moreover , monitor adherence home BP monitoring provide proxy measure acceptance system poor adherence rate would suggest patient perceive futile exercise , lead change care . This study test novel approach treat hypertension , major health problem diabetic patient . The information study invaluable future health care planning .</detailed_description>
