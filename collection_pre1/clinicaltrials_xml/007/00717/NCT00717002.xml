	<brief_summary>The overall objective study ass feasibility use blood detection EGFR mutation patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) Specific aim : 1 . To assess use immuno-separation technique enrich tumor cell population blood NSCLC patient . 2 . To assess use denature high performance liquid chromatography ( DHPLC ) assay detection EGFR mutation blood NSCLC patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection EGFR Mutations Blood Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer : Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The oral tyrosine kinase ( TK ) inhibitor Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) , gefitinib erlotinib , produce dramatic response , encourage response rate possibly improve survival subset NSCLC patient . Evidence suggest somatic EGFR mutation tumor present single reliable biological marker predict response EGFR TK inhibitor . In addition , mutation may early event pathogenesis NSCLC subset patient . Unfortunately , technology EGFR mutation sequence incurs high cost require sufficient tissue , often problem NSCLC . We hypothesize EGFR mutation detect blood propose study determine feasibility detect EGFR mutation blood NSCLC patient . We approach newly diagnose NSCLC patient well patient know respond oral TK inhibitor . We perform EGFR mutation tumor . For blood , use new immuno-separation technique isolate tumor cell perform denature high performance liquid chromatography detect EGFR mutation . If prove feasible detect mutation blood , follow validation study . Many application result hypothesis hold true : 1 ) proof principle technique effectively isolate detect somatic mutation circulate tumor cell , 2 ) simple way overcome problem insufficient tumor sample , 3 ) use early detection lung cancer EGFR mutation prove important pathogenesis subset patient 4 ) technology extend detect new mutation patient become resistant oral TK inhibitor lead new targeted therapy .</detailed_description>
