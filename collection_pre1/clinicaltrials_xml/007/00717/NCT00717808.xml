	<brief_summary>The treatment rheumatoid arthritis improve considerably recent year understand well outcomes achieved optimise dosage schedule conventional drug suppress inflammatory response joint . Furthermore , development protein base drug give parenterally ( i.e . subcutaneous injection intravenous infusion ) , know biologics , give rise even well clinical result . However , despite 60 % patient rheumatoid arthritis still expect unacceptably high degree disease activity prohibitively high cost biologic therapy result ration follow NICE review . Therefore need effective less costly treatment . The propose study design test potential drug interaction one candidate oral treatment , tranilast , gold standard therapy rheumatoid arthritis , methotrexate , give weekly oral , intramuscular intradermal regimen . The drug test , tranilast , analogue naturally occur molecule regulate inflammatory response , currently use treatment allergic inflammation recently show effective animal model multiple sclerosis . Tranilast analogue naturally tryptophan metabolite . Laboratory study cell biology indicate molecule inhibits number key inflammatory pathway function white blood cell play critical role inflammatory feature rheumatoid arthritis . The aim study ass whether tranilast may useful treatment RA . In animal model rheumatoid arthritis , initial assessment show prophylactic administration tranilast interfere development disease . Therapeutically , animal model arthritis , tranilast effective , reduced aspect disease , include joint swelling , clinical score , histological damage dose−dependent fashion , reduce pain . This degree benefit compare well therapeutic highly successful human , anti−TNF therapy . Furthermore study Kennedy Institute Rheumatology Division , Imperial College suggest tranilast great analgesic effect potent steroid dexamethasone effective anti−inflammatory dos</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK : The treatment outcomes rheumatoid arthritis dramatically improve recognition inflammatory component disease need suppress optimally every stage evolution . However , exist conventional oral therapy associate limited efficacy loss effectiveness time . Furthermore therapy associate significant toxicity tolerability problem . Another approach treatment involve use biologic ( protein base ) , parenterally administer therapy direct important inflammatory molecule cell involve disease pathology . Despite notable success anti−TNF therapy , one biologics , approximately one third patient respond adequately costs drug production high . This cause ration healthcare economy . There therefore need new , safe , well tolerate effective drug cost effective . Tranilast ( tryptophan metabolite ) already licence Japan treatment allergy . Basic science study include undertaken The Kennedy Institute indicate drug suppresses activity number key inflammatory mediator well activation lymphocyte ( white blood cell ) responsible perpetuation inflammation associate tissue destruction rheumatoid . Therefore , rationale test effectiveness tranilast vivo treatment arthritis . In animal model arthritis , tranilast effectively reduce joint swell read out pain . Since tranilast well tolerate safe licence treatment indication man , timely test effectiveness rheumatoid arthritis . The majority patient condition treat methotrexate often combination anti−rheumatoid drug . The current study prelude large randomise control study investigate efficacy tranilast rheumatoid arthritis . PURPOSE : This study evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability oral medication , tranilast , patient rheumatoid arthritis another disease modify medication , methotrexate . DESIGN : The study randomise crossover pilot study optional high dose open label phase . METHOD : During study patient either receive tranilast ( 300mg twice day ) placebo drug period seven day . The patient seven day break follow another period seven day patient receive medication . They attend clinic least 6 occasion ( screen , day 2,3 8 9 5 occasion session 2 plus follow session . During study blood sample take assess safety serum concentration study drug interaction methotrexate .</detailed_description>
