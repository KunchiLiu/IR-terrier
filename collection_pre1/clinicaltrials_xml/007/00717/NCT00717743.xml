	<brief_title>T Regulatory Cells Renal Cell Carcinoma ( PILOT STUDY )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>T regulatory cell ( T regs ) recently identify subset T cell inhibitory function immune system . In cancer , show increased proportion T regs several different human malignancy state . T regs find elevated peripheral blood mononuclear cell , drain lymph node primary tumor . There also correlation peripheral blood T regs tumor stage , tumor relapse survival . It propose T regs activate expanded factor produce tumor microenvironment . They think play role prevent demise host T-cell responses cancer , include suboptimal host response vaccine strategy . Strategies reduce T regs cancer patient explore novel immunologic anti-cancer approach . Renal cell cancer ( RCC ) tumor well-known immune-mediated phenomenon spontaneous regression . There paucity data T regs RCC . We propose study frequency peripheral blood T regs nephrectomy RCC . We document baseline frequency T regs RCC nephrectomy result change level . We hypothesize nephrectomy low peripheral T regs normal level early stage RCC , reduce peripheral T reg level advance RCC patient . If find , T regs could future use indicator disease recurrence early stage RCC . In advanced RCC , lower T reg level may help explain previous hypothesis debulking nephrectomy result improve anti-tumor immunity , provide rationale second debulking procedure , correlate subsequent clinical course . The main laboratory technique flow cytometry . This pilot study small patient number . Only blood sample require .</detailed_description>
