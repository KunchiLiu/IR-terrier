	<brief_summary>The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation ( JDRF ) Glucose Sensor Study group carry large , randomized clinical trial ass efficacy , safety cost-effectiveness use real-time continuous glucose monitor ( RT-CGM ) adjunct standard meter plasma glucose test . Although primary outcome &gt; = 7.0 % cohort difference HbA1c level , important secondary outcome difference percent glucose sensor value either target glucose range 70-180 mg/dl difference glucose variability . Prevention biochemical hypoglycemia particularly important outcome low HbA1c cohort . Since CGM system measure interstitial rather plasma glucose CGM value differ simultaneous plasma glucose value 18 % , would extremely useful comparative purpose establish reference range sensor value healthy , non-diabetic control subject study future investigation . The objective protocol establish reference sensor glucose range 3 device utilized JDRF study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . After initial eligibility determine , informed consent assent obtain parent/guardian subject . 2 . Subjects follow test perform : - Hemoglobin A1c ( use DCA2000 equivalent device ) - Oral glucose tolerance test obtain fast 2 hour plasma glucose level - Anti-GAD , anti-IA2 anti-insulin antibody - Subjects HbA1c &gt; 6.0 % and/or fast glucose level &gt; 100 and/or 2 hour glucose level &gt; 140 discontinue study . 3 . Subjects normal A1c glucose level provide RT-CGM home glucose meter ( HGM ) 4 . An RT-CGM sensor insert initiated study personnel . 5 . Subjects would like wear 2 sensor give 2 type RT-CGM . 6 . Subjects instruct wear sensor 3-7 day ( depend type device ) measure blood glucose HGM need calibrate sensor . 7 . Subjects return clinical center 3-7 day sensor wear return RT-CGM HGM . - If subject less 48 hour sensor data ask wear another sensor return 3-7 day later .</detailed_description>
