	<brief_summary>In developmental stage laparoscopic cholecystectomy consider 'unsafe ' 'technically difficult ' perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy acute cholecystitis . With increase experience laparoscopic surgery , number center report use laparoscopic cholecystectomy acute cholecystitis , suggest technically feasible expense high conversion rate , 35 per cent common bile duct lesion . The HARMONIC SCALPEL® ( H ) lead ultrasonic cut coagulate surgical device , offer surgeon important benefit include : minimal lateral thermal tissue damage , minimal char desiccation . H technology reduces need ligature simultaneous cut coagulation : moreover electricity patient H great precision near vital structure produce minimal smoke improve visibility surgical field . In retrospective series LC perform H demonstrate feasible effective minimal operate time blood loss : report also low conversion rate ( 3.9 % ) . However prospective randomize controlled trial show advantage H compare MD ( commonly use electrical scalpel ) LC . Aim RCT demonstrate H reduce conversion rate compare MD LC AC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DESIGN The study project prospective , randomized investigation . The study perform Department Emergency Surgery St Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital ( Bologna , Italy ) , large teaching institution , participation surgeon accept involve . The patient divide two group : first group patient submit early LC within 72 hour diagnosis H second group submit early LC within 72 hour MD . HOW RANDOMIZED The randomization obtain computer-generated schedule . The result randomization seal numbered envelope . After cholecystitis diagnosis patient fulfil inclusion criterion responsible surgeon ask patient participate study . If patient agree , he/ sign inform consent . After patient 's consent randomization carry . The responsible surgeon record patient name ( number ) . All eligible patient record . STATISTICS POWER CALCULATIONS : Sample size calculate reach confidence level 95 % power 80 % .A sample size 42 patient calculate supposing hospital stay LC H conversion rate reduce 35 % 3 % . The sample size 21 patient group ( 42 patient whole study ) .For comparison two group , chi-square analysis Fisher 's exact test use appropriate qualitative data , Student t-test ( normal variable ) Mann Whitney U-test ( nonnormal variable ) quantitative data . For multivariate analysis stepwise logistic regression apply . A probability 0.05 le accept statistically significant . INTERVENTION Preoperative data collect include patient demographic comorbid condition ( genitourinary , cardiac , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , renal , rheumatologic ) detail history symptom onset . The procedure perform surgeon perform least 50 LCs . On admission , patient start cefotaxime , 2 g IV every 12h , continue postoperatively accord NNISS score . The standard four-trocar operative technique use LC acute cholecystitis . When gallbladder distend first aspirate . To allow good hold gallbladder large graspers insert 5 mm right low port . The cystic artery duct clip-ligated MD group whereas H group cystic artery duct close H. In H group surgeon use H , whereas MD group surgeon use MD . The gallbladder intraperitoneal `` drop '' stone collect endoscopic bag extract umbilical cannula site , extend . A closed system suction drain leave . Fascial closure attempt umbilical cannula site . The skin cannula site close staple . Conversion laparotomy decide operating surgeon conversion motivate . Data Collection Patients ' data sheet generate contain demographic data preoperative , operative , postoperative information . Pre-operative note concern history gallbladder stone , presence associate disease ( cardiac , hypertension , diabetes , malignancy ) , duration gallbladder complaint ( indication onset disease ) , find palpable gallbladder , temperature , laboratory result WBC count , serum bilirubin , gamma GT , PCR , IL-6 alkaline phosphatase . Ultrasound finding also report . Operative data concern macroscopic finding ( acute cholecystitis , gangrenous cholecystitis , hydrops , empyema gallbladder ) , presence small stone ( &lt; 1 cm diameter ) large bile stone ( &gt; 1 cm diameter ) , information regard perforation gallbladder intraperitoneally `` lose '' stone , reason con¬version , duration surgery . Postoperative note interest include use nasogastric tube drain , amount analgesic use , ( evaluation pain VAS score ) , complication , length hospital stay . Complications classify surgical infection ( wound infection , subphrenic subhepatic abscess ) ; noninfectious surgi¬cal problem ( e.g. , bile duct injury , hemorrhage ) ; remote infec¬tions ( urinary respiratory ) ; miscellaneous problem ( e.g. , atelectasis , deep vein thrombosis , AMI , CVA , etc ) . The collected information enter database either continuous categorical variable statistical analysis . Following operative procedure , normal sterile dress apply cover abdomen . A second surgical team , aware operative finding surgical dissection instrument , assume care patient . Postoperative care ability discharge hospital determine second surgical team . The primary operative team every moment available emergent consultation . Patient discharge base good medical practice criterion : 1 ) apyrexia 2 ) absence disease require hospitalisation 3 ) return bowel function 4 ) patient 's compliance . - IS THERE A PLACEBO ? No - INFORMED CONSENT TO BE SOUGHT ? Yes ( see : Case Report Form ) - INFORMED CONSENT FORM OR INFORMATION SHEET ? Yes ( see : Case Report Form ) . In informed consent form , patient receive information study protocol , confidential nature personal data fill questionnaire signing refuse . There inconvenience cause patient . No incentive plan patient regard operation follow-up . All medical information obtain patient keep confidentially among research scientist conduct study . The patient free withdraw study , whenever want without obligation . STOPPING RULES In case newly discover statistically significant advantage one group . PRIMARY ENDPOINTS The aim study demonstrate H reduce conversion rate compare MD LC AC also differences term morbidity , mortality , operation time , hospital stay , postoperative pain , return normal activity evaluate . The primary endpoint study : - To evaluate conversion rate - To evaluate morbidity , mortality , operation time - To evaluate hospital stay , postoperative pain , return normal activity The onset complication record intraoperatively , postoperatively , discharge , 7-days , 1-month 6-months . - PLANNED SUBGROUP ANALYSES ? No . - SIDE EFFECTS QUANTIFICATION ? Yes There different side effect - IS THERE AN ANALYSIS PLAN ? Yes All mention data record Case Report Form ( annexed proposal ) later store computer database . At end study final statistical examination carry . - ARE THERE PLANS FOR INTERIM ANALYSIS ? Yes An interim statistical examination data do every 3 month period patient ' inclusion study . Then end every complete follow-up period ( 1-month , 6-months ) . - ARE THERE AN INDEPENDENT DATA-MONITORING COMITTEE ? No TYPE OF ANALYSIS The statistical analysis carry use Epi Info 2000 , Version 1.1 software package ( Dean AG , Arner TG , Sangam S , Sunki GG , Friedman R , Lantinga M , Zubieta JC , Sullivan KM , Smith DC . Epi Info 2000 , database statistic program public health professional use Windows 95 , 98 , NT , 2000 computer ; Centers Disease Control Prevention , Atlanta , Georgia , USA , 2000 ) . INDEMNITIES SPECIFIED No incentive plan patient regard operation follow-up . FINISHING DATE The study take approximately 6 month - 1 year inclusion period . According number AC manage monthly , duration inclusion period approximately 1 year reach number 42 enrolled patient . REPORTING DATE An interim report plan end complete follow-up period . - IS THE STUDY CLINICALLY NECESSARY ? Yes AC common disease . Any improvement field benefit many patient reduce morbidity , mortality , conversion rate , operation time , hospital stay , postoperative pain , return normal activity aesthetic result . All patient inform study inform consent obtain . There inconvenience cause patient . All medical information obtain patient keep confidentially among research scientist conduct study . The patient free withdrawn study , whenever want without obligation .</detailed_description>
