	<brief_summary>Most patient diabetes mellitus measure blood glucose level quite often , order maintain proper glycemic control . Current method self-monitoring blood glucose invasive , painful , uncomfortable , allow occasional , time-to-time , measurement . Real-time continuous monitoring would provide helpful tool improvement glycemic control , thus decrease incidence hypoglycemia improve glucose control . The Mellitor sensor new concept continue glucose monitoring device . The Mellitor device implantable continuous glucose monitoring sensor intend detection episode hyperglycemia hypoglycemia diabetic patient , facilitates acute long-term therapy adjustment . This study design order evaluate glucose measurement capability Mellitor sensor develop . Transudate liquid sample , withdraw clinical procedure normally immediately disposed , use glucose measurement Mellitor sensor . Study Design This study ex-vivo comparative study . 20 patient recruit study , accord patient ' inflow meeting eligibility criterion . Study Goal Study objective evaluate feasibility Mellitor Sensor technology glucose level measurement . Study Endpoint Mellitor technology feasibility establish compare Mellitor glucose measurement result , base transudate/exudates liquid withdrawal medical reason , `` gold standard , Yellow Springs '' glucose analyzer , comparable , calibrate approved device use transudate/exudates liquid . Interdevice variability within 10 % .</brief_summary>
