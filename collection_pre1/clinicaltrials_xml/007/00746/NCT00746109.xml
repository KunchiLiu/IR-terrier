	<brief_summary>Superficial skin soft tissue abscess frequently manage opening procedure call `` incision drainage '' . It routine practice United States place pack material inside abscess cavity opening , order promote well wound heal limit abscess recurrence . However , practice never systematically study proven decrease complication improve heal . Patients wound pack usually return emergency room practice set multiple `` wound check '' dressing/packing change lead missed day work school utilization healthcare resource . This procedure often painful may even require conscious sedation ( risk entail ) especially child . With rate superficial skin soft tissue abscess rise , emergency room resource stretch , important determine whether pack wound necessary even advantageous patient . This study first systematically evaluate efficacy wound pack superficial skin soft tissue abscess incision drainage child . The investigator evaluate wound healing , complication , recurrence pain associate pack short long term . In addition , investigator also evaluate utility bedside point-of-care ultrasound use predict presence pu inside abscess cavity . This test may useful determine whether incision drainage necessary individual skin infection suspicious abscess .</brief_summary>
