	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) currently among top three lead cause central vision loss veteran ( Chomsky et al. , 1995 ) prevalent cause blindness among veteran ( 37.2 % , Quillen &amp; Henry , 2000 ) . The loss central vision associate disease profound impact quality life affect , many suffer depression . It devastate longer able read newspaper recognize facial expression . The use prefer retinal location ( PRLs ) compensate diseased fovea offer hope patient regain function . The investigator develop protocol include train two major visual skill area : - Visual awareness eccentric viewing ; - Reading practice sequentially lexical information Module 1 focus make patient aware good vision eccentric location relative degrade vision diseased fovea . Module 2 focus reading practice without eye movement . These program curriculum preliminary result provide present proposal . The primary aim proposal quantitatively assess relative effectiveness improve read establish minimum training time need skill improvement . One hundred twenty patient macular disease already use PRL similar visual characteristic ( e.g. , visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , size scotoma , duration disease ) include study . All patient train module use repeat measures-completely counterbalanced - design control train order effect . In addition , patient assess use outcome measure read ( use MNRead Acuity Charts View Sentences Test ) . The performance patient outcomes battery post-training compare pre-training performance battery . Questionnaires ( Veterans Administration Low Vision Visual Functioning Questionnaire , CES-D , Short Form-36 , Adaptation Vision Loss Scale ) also administer assess perceive ability perform everyday task , adaptation vision loss , mood , general health . In addition , patient also assess exercise practice module end daily training session determine exactly train protocol improvement performance exercise train occur . These daily performance measure provide fine scale detecting performance change . Statistical analysis conduct answer follow question : - Does combination eccentric view awareness oculomotor training produce significant improvement read rate ? - Which exercise effective train visual skill associate read point course training patient reach asymptotic performance ? - How co-factors age , PRL size location , cognitive capability relate train outcome ? Advancements make area retinal cell transplantation , gene therapy , retinal prosthetics . When technique become part standard clinical care , likely patient require vision rehabilitation technique help make sense potentially fragmented percept . This research offer evaluation relative successes component read rehabilitation lead design efficient effective composite training strategy .</detailed_description>
