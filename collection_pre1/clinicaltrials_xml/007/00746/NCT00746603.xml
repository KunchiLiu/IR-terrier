	<brief_summary>Lay abstract : Study Purpose With contemporary combine modality therapy expect longterm survival child adolescents Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) exceedingly high . Thus , emphasis future therapeutic intervention must include attention late effect therapy . The development cardiovascular disease late effect radiation therapy well described document . Our recent pilot study child young adult HD survivor reveal significant subclinical atherosclerosis evidence increase Carotid Artery Intima Media Thickness ( CIMT ) compare control . The high CIMT value positively associate increase age , total cholesterol , LDLcholesterol diastolic BP . This finding present child young adult receive low dose radiation suggest chemotherapy disease process contribute development atherosclerosis risk cardiovascular disease . Numerous study show HMG CoA reductase inhibitor ( `` statin '' ) effective reduce progression atherosclerosis adult . These agent study child young adult decade . The primary aim study : To obtain pilot safety data use simvastatin young adult treat HD . The secondary aim study : To obtain pilot data effect simvastatin subclinical carotid artery atherosclerosis measure Carotid Artery IMT young adult treat HD . To obtain pilot data effect simvastatin marker inflammation measure serum young adult treat HD . To obtain pilot data serve basis development multicenter randomize study use simvastatin survivor HD .</brief_summary>
