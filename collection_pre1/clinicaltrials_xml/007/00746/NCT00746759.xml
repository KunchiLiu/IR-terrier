	<detailed_description>Allegro Diagnostics fund multi-center study validate extend new diagnostic tool measure global gene expression airway epithelial cell obtain routine bronchoscopy suspect lung cancer patient . The test , highly sensitive specific lung cancer , measure level expression gene cell brush large bronchus diagnostic bronchoscopy . Similar brushing epithelial cell nose analyze determine gene expression cell use screen tool subject may risk develop lung cancer future .</detailed_description>
