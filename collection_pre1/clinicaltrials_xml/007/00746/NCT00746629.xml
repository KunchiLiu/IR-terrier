	<brief_title>Familial Overweight : Comparing Use Strategies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric obesity highly prevalent problem , require treatment prevention effort reduce cardiovascular disease risk metabolic consequence among affected child child population . The efficacy family-based behavioral pediatric obesity treatment likely compromise non-optimal parent child behavioral skill use ( BSU ) . In pediatric obesity treatment trial , BSU assessment infrequent , incomplete , unknown reliability . Poor incomplete BSU measurement precludes improve behavioral intervention pediatric obesity . Furthermore , different approach help family initiate sustain BSU follow treatment test . This study aim investigate 1 ) prospective relation BSU measure follow treatment change child weight status , physical activity , diet , 2 ) difference BSU trajectory two different implementation approach follow treatment . Eighty-two parent-child ( 7-11 y.o . ) pair participate 20-week treatment follow-up 3 6 month . Participants randomly assign receive either prescriptive self-directed implementation approach family-based behavioral pediatric obesity treatment . BSU ( monitoring , contingency management , environmental control ) report assessed pre-treatment , 5th , 10th , 15th treatment session , post-treatment 3-month 6-month follow-ups parent , interventionist , supplemental evaluator . Prospective association BSU , measure multiple time multiple informant/formats , change child weight status ( z-BMI ) weight-related behavior ( diet , physical activity ) course treatment throughout follow examine . This proposal provide important information type BSU measurement relate short- long-term treatment efficacy , provide pilot data relative efficacy different implementation approach initiate sustain BSU pediatric obesity intervention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Child age : 711 year . Englishspeaking . Parent willing able actively participate treatment . Overweight child : 85th percentile age genderspecific BMI , 175 % median BMI age gender . Overweight parent : BMIâ‰¥ 25 . Live within 50 mile Children 's Hospital Regional Medical Center . Medical condition know promote obesity ( e.g . PraderWilli syndrome , Cushing 's syndrome ) . Already involved another weight control program . Consistently engage weightaffecting behavior ( e.g . child : smoking ) Significant diagnose obesityrelated comorbidities ( e.g . Type 2 diabetes ) Taking weightaffecting medication ( e.g . Ritalin ) Participating parent child : exist thought disorder , suicidality , substance abuse disorder , psychological medical condition may preclude full participation . Participating parent child : Disability illness would preclude engage least moderate intensity physical activity . Participating parent child : Current prior diagnose eat disturbance .</criteria>
