	<brief_title>Immediate Management Patient With Rupture : Open Versus Endovascular Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rupture main blood vessel body abdomen ( rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm ) fatal three-quarters case . In past , survive reach hospital alive undergone emergency open surgery repair aneurysm stop bleeding : however , major emergency surgery half patient leave hospital alive . A new , less-invasive method aneurysm repair , endovascular repair , base repair aneurysm insert repair graft one arteries groin . Endovascular repair test elective situation associate 3-fold reduction operative mortality versus standard open surgery . Early work select patient suggest endovascular repair may associate 2-fold reduction operative mortality rapid recovery rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm . However , 55-70 % patient anatomically suitable endovascular repair . Therefore , research aim determine whether strategy preferential emergency endovascular repair reduces mortality cost rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm . Critically ill patient clinical diagnosis rupture aneurysm randomise , emergency room , strategy endovascular repair possible ( endovascular first ) current standard care ( immediate transfer operate theatre emergency open surgery ) . Patients randomise `` endovascular first '' require specialist radiological examination ( CT scan ) assess anatomical suitability plan endovascular repair . This cause short delay definitive repair commence . Those patient suitable endovascular repair , CT scan , take standard open surgery . Patients randomise 16-20 specialist centre UK , already attained sufficient experience use endovascular repair rupture aneurysm offer routine service . The primary outcome measure 30-day operative mortality , hope improve 14 % `` endovascular first '' strategy ( 47 % 33 % ) . We also shall measure mortality ( in-hospital , one year ) , cost , quality life cost-effectiveness key outcome : expect improve endovascular repair . The research team include specialist clinical trial , health economics , statistic , pre-hospital &amp; emergency care , interventional radiology , vascular &amp; endovascular surgery , critical care , aneurysm research service user .</detailed_description>
