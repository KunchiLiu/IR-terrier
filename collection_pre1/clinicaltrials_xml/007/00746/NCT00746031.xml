	<brief_summary>Fibroids present 80 % woman reproductive age . Associated heavy menstrual bleeding often indication surgery . At present long-term medical treatment fibroid . There unmet need pharmacologic agent able reduce excessive bleeding symptom associate increased uterine volume , could prevent significantly delay surgery without cause significant unwanted hypoestrogenic side effect allow preservation fertility . The purpose study investigate validate novel MR image non-invasive biomarker monitoring responses medical intervention aim reduction excessive menstrual bleeding decrease uterine/ fibroid volume . MR image non-invasive , involve ionize radiation new technique potential resolve tissue detail near cellular level . The investigator aim establish feasibility reproducibility novel MR image technique evaluation treatment response woman fibroid provide mechanistic information whether reduction blood flow uterine/fibroid vasculature shrinkage fibroid dependent upon subject hypoestrogenic .</brief_summary>
