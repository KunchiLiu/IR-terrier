	<brief_title>Quetiapine XR Cognitive Functional Disability Clinically Stable Patients With Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In contrast previous conception bipolar disorder illness cognitive impairment limit manic depress episode , become clear cognitive impairment common clinically stable bipolar patient . Quetiapine report beneficial cognitive effect several randomize controlled trial schizophrenia . It yet study bipolar disorder , promise result use extend release quetiapine maintenance treatment bipolar disorder suggest cognitive benefit could detect . Moreover , quetiapine show direct beneficial effect performance-based measure social competence schizophrenia improve quality life ( QoL ) bipolar depression . We propose study quetiapine augmentation mood stabilizer monotherapy clinically stable patient bipolar disorder . This randomized , placebo control trial , attentional impairment primary outcome cognitive performance variable measure social everyday living skill , well subjective QoL , secondary outcome . An additional possible benefit quetiapine treatment , one directly relevant neuropsychological performance , increase activity cortical norepinephrine ( NE ) . Thus , study cognitive enhancement quetiapine , examination cortical NE neet occupancy substantial interest . General Background : This three site study include Emory University ( Coordinating site ) , Duke University , University Toronto . We choose three site difficult task recruit clinically stable patient bipolar accomplish quickly study complete within two-year time frame . Subjects : We recruit 100 patient study . Fifty percent receive active treatment quetiapine XR . All participant meet diagnostic criterion bipolar I II disorder medical record-based evidence least one previous manic mixed episode . They clinically stable , evidence meeting criterion low score Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) Montgomery-Asberg Depression rating scale ( MADRS ) . They also receive therapy mood stabilizer , either lithium approve mood stabilize agent . Visit Schedule : This 10 week study six-week active treatment protocol . All interested patient meet study entry criterion screen stability four two week prior baseline assessment . Patients also re-assessed stability baseline . Patients fail meet entry criterion baseline come back second screen 2 4 week . Throughout treatment , medication adjustment limit change le 25 % time period . Assessments : Cognitive assessment perform baseline , week 2 week 6 active treatment . Clinical Assessments perform screen rescreening , baseline , week 2 6 . Biological Measures : Bloods NE net occupancy drawn baseline , week 2 , week 6 . Serum level quetiapine three assessment also examine . Cognitive Assessments : We focus cognitive assessment type cognitive impairment previously report bipolar disorder . Our focus attention , episodic memory , process speed , work memory . This instrumentation proven able detect sedation well , use result assessment identify potential adverse sedation effect .</detailed_description>
