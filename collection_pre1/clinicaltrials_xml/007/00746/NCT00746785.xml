	<brief_summary>Craving alcohol related loss control drink major target biological behavioral intervention alcohol dependence . Our previous research demonstrate olanzapine ( dopamine antagonist ) attenuate crave alcohol , variant gene express D4 receptor influence crave alcohol , olanzapine particularly effective reduce crave among individual variant . Pilot data recent 12 week trial olanzapine indicate olanzapine well tolerate olanzapine reduces drinking , particularly among individual aforementioned genetic variant . The objective present application examine effectiveness olanzapine ( 5 mg/day ) , compare olanzapine ( 2.5 mg/day ) placebo control , term reduce crave alcohol use behavior among treatment seek alcoholic . Furthermore , present application examine whether effect olanzapine drink outcomes mediate effect specific putative mechanism ( i.e. , cue-elicited crave alcohol ) determine whether DRD4 VNTR polymorphism marker effectiveness olanzapine . To end , 202 alcohol dependent subject randomly assign medication group receive 12 week medication . Subjects complete follow-up assessment 3 6 month end treatment . It expect olanzapine significantly reduce cue-elicited craving alcohol use behavior dose dependent fashion course 12 week trial follow-up period , compare placebo condition . Furthermore , expect effect olanzapine alcohol use behavior mediate effect olanzapine cue-elicited craving effect olanzapine cue-elicited craving alcohol use behavior moderate DRD4 VNTR , olanzapine effective among individual 7 repeat allele . The successful completion propose research expect advance new medication alcohol dependence advance genetic marker predict effectiveness medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The first goal study determine whether olanzapine effective reduce cue-elicited craving ( i.e. , subjective craving well activation midbrain prefrontal cortex exposure alcohol cue ) alcohol reduce alcohol use sample alcohol dependent subject . The second goal test putative mechanism change determine whether effect olanzapine alcohol use behavior mediate effect olanzapine cue-elicited craving . The final goal examine whether genetic difference moderate effect olanzapine . [ The polymorphism examine involves D4 dopamine receptor gene ( DRD4 ) , variable number tandem repeat ( VNTR ) exon 3 ( Van Tol et al. , 1992 ) . With respect DRD4 VNTR , individual least one copy allele 7 repeat hereafter refer DRD4 L individual , individual alleles few 7 repeat hereafter refer DRD4 S individual . ] In addition laboratory study dopamine antagonist alcohol crave ( e.g. , Modell et al. , 1993 ; Hutchison et al. , 2001 ) , recent clinical report suggest clozapine , potent D4 receptor antagonist , reduce substance abuse among individual comorbid substance abuse/dependence ( Green et al. , 1999 ; Zimmet et al. , 2000 ; Lee et al , 1998 ) specifically , alcohol use ( Drake et al. , 2000 ) . Animal study also suggest clozapine reduces voluntary intake nicotine ( Kameda et al. , 2000 ) . Given early finding , conduct laboratory test effect olanzapine cue-elicited craving crave alcohol consumption among heavy social drinker ( Hutchison et al. , 2001 ) . We decide test olanzapine also target D4 receptor , although strongly clozapine , olanzapine best side effect profile among FDA approve medication target dopamine receptor broadly , D4 specifically . This initial test demonstrate olanzapine attenuate effect alcohol cue two separate measure urge drink across two separate experimental session olanzapine prevent increase urge drink alcohol consumption . With respect effect urge drink , finding study generally consistent theoretical premise appetitive behavior partially mediate mesolimbic dopamine activation . To replicate extend previous result olanzapine , second study design examine whether olanzapine ( 5 mg ) reduce crave compare cyproheptadine ( 4 mg ) , use active control medication . It important note publish study ( knowledge ) use stringent experimental control test pharmacological agent target alcohol crave human . For example , previous study naltrexone utilized placebo control . The result investigation indicate olanzapine cyproheptadine produce equivalent level sedation . However , olanzapine significantly reduce crave consume alcohol , compare cyproheptadine ( Hutchison et al. , 2003 ) . Moreover , significant medication DRD4 VNTR polymorphism interaction olanzapine reduce alcohol-elicited craving , particularly among DRD4 L individual . To extend finding , conduct 12 week , randomize , double-blind trial olanzapine treatment alcohol dependence ( Hutchison et al. , press ) . Consistent previous study , result suggest olanzapine reduce cue elicit crave alcohol consumption significantly among DRD4 L individual , DRD4 S individual . Both last two study conduct Boulder GCRC . Here , double-blind , placebo-controlled 3 ( Medication : olanzapine 5 mg , olanzapine 2.5 mg , vs. placebo ) x 7 ( Time : Baseline , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 week ) mix factorial design , medication between-subjects factor time within-subjects factor , use test treatment outcome hypothesis . Subjects randomly assign receive either olanzapine ( 5 mg ) , olanzapine ( 2.5 mg ) , placebo period 12 week equal number DRD4 L individual medication group . All subject also receive 7 session medication management / supportive therapy ( detail ) . Follow-up assessment obtain 4 , 8 , 12 week ( end treatment ) , 24 week , 36 week .</detailed_description>
