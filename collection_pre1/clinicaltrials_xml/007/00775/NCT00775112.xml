	<brief_summary>We develop position cushion LP allow child relaxed adequate position , maintain position throughout LP . This study aim evaluate benefit device technical quality LPs , pain , anxiety , post LP syndrome , satisfaction child , parent caregiver . The study two-centre , open , randomized trial , two parallel group . Children age 2 18 year undergo LP eligible , include study . Those used cushion , medical reason prevent use cushion , refuse whose parent refuse could include . Randomization stratify centre . Four cushion size available age range : 2-6 year , 6-10 year , 10-15 15-18 year . The primary outcome rate success , define LP reach objective first attempt , without hemorrhage ( visible hemorrhage RBC &gt; 50/mm3 CSF sample ) . Secondary outcome include : child 's pain use visual analogic scale ( VAS ) , parent caregiver perception child 's pain ( VAS ) ; child , parent , caregiver physician perform LP satisfaction ; child cooperation use `` Le Baron Scale '' , occurrence post LP syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our study open , randomize , control trial , two parallel group assign `` LP pillow '' `` intervention '' conduct patient undergo LP . Participants Children age 2 18 year undergo LP eligible inclusion . Children already participate used LP pillow , medical condition ( orthopaedic anomaly ) contraindicating use LP pillow whose parent refuse consent exclude . A permuted-block algorithm use randomization , participant stratify accord centre . Concealed allocation achieve phone call coordination centre eligibility check baseline data collection . Intervention The LP pillow make polyethylene microcellular foam , coat rubber facilitate decontamination . It place thigh child sit trunk lean forward . This position ensure maximum lumbar flexion whereas rest trunk pillow allow relaxation paravertebral muscle . The axis body spinal column maintain perfectly symmetrical sagittal plane ( see illustration Fig 1 ) . The pillow include side support head ; face remain uncovered child could breathe speak comfortably ; also facilitate nitrous oxide administration . Props support patient 's arm maintain cervical column neutral position . An opening allow touch child 's hand forearm . Splints bottom side immobilize child 's thighs ensure effective stabilization . Four size available correspond approximately follow age range : 2-6 year , 6-10 year , 10-15 15-18 year . Two set available study , one per centre . Outcomes Primary outcome technical quality LP , classify success failure . A successful LP define one achieves purpose ( sample and/or treatment ) first attempt , without visible haemorrhage RBC &lt; 50/mm3 cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sample ( biochemical analysis ) . Secondary outcome include : child 's pain , evaluate self-administered visual analogical scale ( VAS ) child 6 year age ; parent ' caregiver ' perception child 's pain ; satisfaction child , parent , caregiver physician perform LP assess use verbal scoring ; child cooperation rat `` LeBaron Scale '' ( Lebaron 1984 ) . Other outcome include number attend person ( parent and/ caregiver ) ; duration positioning procedure ; incidence , symptoms duration post-LP syndrome assess 48 hour LP phone interview . Data collection include anaesthetic , sedative analgesic drug use ; needle size ( 19G , 20G , 22G ) ; general status child evaluate Karnofsky Lansky score ( Lansky 1985 ) ; platelet count ; number previous LP ; date satisfaction last LP ( verbal scale ) , practitioner experience perform LP , presence parent , aim LP : diagnosis , therapeutic monitoring , treatment injection ; amount CSF remove ( drop ) . The study protocol approve institutional review board Lyon A - Hôtel-Dieu June 8th 2004 , conduct accordance Helsinki Declaration . All parent give write informed consent participation child . Children ask give write consent fully able understand propose procedure . Data manage use CLININFO S.A. ( France ) software service clinical trial data management quality control . Sample size statistical analysis The protocol initially include total 80 child . The sample size calculation base rate success 70 % control group 95 % pillow group , 80 % -power 0.05 two-sided significance level ( N Query® software ) . Based rate success control group inclusion 40th child , sample size re-estimated increase 124 child ( 62 per group ) inclusion period extend 12 24 month . Comparisons group perform use non parametric method , i.e . Wilcoxon rank test Fisher 's exact test , depend nature variable . A logistic regression model fit platelet count number LP prior enter study . An exploratory subgroup analysis perform child 6 year age . Comparisons p-value le 0.05 consider significant . The STATA 9.2 ( SatatCorp 2005 . Stata Statistical Software : Release 9.0 College Station , TX : Satat Corporation ) software use perform statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
