Fat transfer breast , popularize Coleman , perform internationally since 1990s . Despite duration , literature lack accurate outcome data fat transfer breast question regard viability adipocytes transfer exist . Sources various publication show cell viability 100 % however study long term clinical outcome quote rate 10 % 80 % .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our goal study prospectively acquire information protocol outline accurate long-term outcome fat transfer breast . Currently , fat graft breast treatment option condition micromastia , breast ptosis , post mastectomy breast reconstruction , asymmetric breast , congenital malformation breast development treatment complication associate implant augmentation mammoplasty . In addition fat grafting , current surgical treatment condition mainly base technique require implant augmentation reconstruction . Although safety saline implant well study document , data extrapolate new generation silicone implant alternative fat graft need investigate . Also implant augmentation reconstruction come price capsular contracture , implant deflation , infection future corrective surgery . We plan prospectively study outcome fat graft patient condition period 5 year . The collected information enter database prospectively collect review . Patients demographic , information obtain preoperative postoperative visit along pertinent finding regard fat transfer breast collect database investigation .</detailed_description>
