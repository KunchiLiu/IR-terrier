	<brief_summary>This study ( http : //pdrisk.ninds.nih.gov ) determine people risk factor Parkinson disease ( PD ) biomarkers ( objective way measure disease process ) show disease process actually go , people abnormal biomarkers go develop PD several year follow-up . Biomarkers Parkinson disease ( PD ) might identify people healthy may develop disease later life . Healthy volunteer people certain risk factor develop PD 18 70 year age may eligible study . People follow risk factor include : - Family history PD - Loss sense smell - Fall blood pressure stand - REM behavior disorder ( type sleep disturbance ) Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Screening examination - Medical neurological history physical examination - Tests rating scale movement , sense smell , mood , attention , fatigue , pain , think . - Measurement blood pressure pulse rate lie stand - Blood draw genetic test - Inpatient test NIH Clinical Center 2-3 day , include : - Measurements blow resistance - Measurements blood pressure pulse rate - Blood draw level various chemical - PET MRI scan - Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) - Electrocardiogram - Skin electrical conduction test ( test sweat production ) - Skin core temperature measurement - Transcranial ultrasound ( sound-wave test head ) - Follow-up testing ( five visit 18-month interval ) repeat test list , exclude genetic test spinal tap</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This Protocol test whether individual statistical risk factor Parkinson disease ( PD ) abnormal value biomarkers central peripheral catecholaminergic innervation whether at-risk individual positive biomarkers develop PD within 7.5 year follow-up . Study Population : The subject individual may risk develop PD , ( ) genetic risk i.e. , family history PD genotypic abnormality know associate statistically PD ; ( b ) olfactory dysfunction i.e. , decrease ability distinguish among odor ; ( c ) symptomatic rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) ; ( ) orthostatic hypotension . A total 200 at-risk subject undergo catecholaminergic biomarker test ( 18 ) F-DOPA brain ( 18 ) F-dopamine cardiac scan . At-risk subject positive biomarkers compare at-risk subject without positive biomarkers , term development PD follow-up . Up 20 control subject include , add database normal value catecholaminergic biomarkers . Design : The study include four phase recruitment , screening , laboratory biomarkers test , follow-up . Recruitment advertisement web site questionnaire self-reported risk . A screening examination do NIH Clinical Center , confirm risk status . Based screen examination result , subject undergo inpatient clinical laboratory testing , identify central peripheral catecholaminergic denervation . In follow-up phase , subject re-tested inpatient approximately every 18 month total 5 re-evaluations ( 90 month , 7.5 year ) , detect onset characteristic movement disorder PD follow status catecholaminergic innervation . Outcome Measures : Primary : Diagnosis PD Board-certified neurologist blind risk factor status result catecholaminergic biomarkers test . If PD diagnose , time diagnosis . Secondary : UPDRS ; ( 18 ) F-DOPA brain scanning , ( 18 ) F-dopamine cardiac scanning ; CSF plasma neurochemical ; neuropsychological rating scale ; autonomic function testing , retrospective CSF proteomics ; retrospective DNA analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals report least 3 follow 4 risk factor protocolspecific website may invite Screening Examination . All subject must ability provide consent participation study . Otherwise eligible candidate participant take medication would interfere scientific result may include , ( 1 ) medication hold temporarily safely substitute , ( 2 ) medication hold participant inpatient . The prescribe physician contact , participant 's permission , withhold substitute medication consider . 1 . Genetic Risk : A positive family history ( one immediate one nonimmediate family member PD ) positive genetic testing ( e.g. , LRRK2 , alphasynuclein , glucocerebrosidase ) satisfy risk factor criterion . 2 . Olfactory Dysfunction : Olfactory dysfunction report protocolspecific website satisfies criterion . This may confirm UPSIT send mail prior Screening Examination . 3 . REM Behavior Disorder ( RBD ) : To satisfy risk factor criterion , individual must movement body limb associate dream least one following : potentially harmful sleep behavior , dream appear act , sleep behavior disrupts sleep continuity . 4 . Orthostatic Hypotension ( OH ) : To satisfy risk factor criterion , individual report symptom orthostatic hypotension orthostatic hypotension protocolspecific website . This may confirm orthostatic vital sign prior Screening Examination . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age : People younger 18 year old old 70 year old exclude . 2 . Risk : A candidate subject exclude , judgment Principal Investigator , Protocol participation would place subject substantially increase acute medical risk . This include risk associate air travel NIH . A candidate subject may exclude study , opinion Principal Investigator Clinical Director , medical risk outweigh potential scientific benefit . An example risk inability travel safely NIH Clinical Center , Bethesda , Maryland , due neurological disorder associate frequent fall . 3 . Disqualifying Conditions : A candidate subject exclude disqualify condition . Examples disqualify condition insulindependent diabetes , hepatic renal failure , symptomatic congestive heart failure , severe anemia , psychosis , ventricular arrhythmia , symptomatic coronary heart disease . Unable Provide Consent : Persons unable provide consent ( e.g. , due dementia ) exclude . MRI : Persons unable undergo MRI safely , due implant metal , exclude MRI procedure . Safe Travel : A candidate participant exclude person unable travel safely NIH Clinical Center , Bethesda , Maryland , due neurological disorder associate frequent fall . 4 . Medications : A candidate subject exclude clinical consideration require continued treatment drug likely interfere scientific result . Chronic , ongoing use drug tricyclic antidepressant affect clinical laboratory result exclude candidate subject . People know suspected allergy hypersensitivity test drug exclude . Candidate subject discontinue medication discussion Principal Investigator , Research Nurse , Nurse Practitioner , Clinical Fellow . Temporary discontinuation serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRIs ) venlafaxine ( Effexor ) , duloxetine ( Cymbalta ) , desvenlafaxine ( Pristiq ) result rapid rebound depression anxiety , treatment SNRIs exclusionary . 5 . Herbal Medicines Dietary Supplements : If subject wish continue herbal medicine dietary supplement study , search available medical identifies drug effect know expect interfere experimental result , subject may exclude , discretion Principal Investigator 6 . Practical Limitations : People feel would difficult insert catheter vein may exclude . People expect clinically tolerate lying still supine test exclude . 7 . Pregnancy : Pregnant lactate woman exclude</criteria>
