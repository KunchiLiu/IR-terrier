	<brief_summary>Background : - Positron emission tomography ( PET ) use radioactive substance call tracer locate area cancer body . For test , patient give injection tracer lie large donut-shaped scanner detects body radioactivity accumulates . Computed tomography ( CT ) scan use low dose x-ray help good localize radioactive tracer concentrate . PET/CT scan usually do lymphoma patient treatment start end treatment evaluate response therapy . - PET scan typically use sugar-like radioactive tracer call fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) low-dose x-ray . Sometimes , however , FDG PET scan show look like active disease presence mass chemotherapy even live cancer cell . Doctors particular problem evaluate response treatment happen tell mass active cancer dead tumor cell . - An experimental tracer call 18F- fluorothymidine ( FLT ) high uptake active tumor cell may better able evaluate treatment response . Objectives : - To test use FLT PET/CT image assess treatment response patient lymphoma . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old enrol lymphoma therapy study NIH Clinical Center CALGB 50330 study another location . Design : - There two arm study : - The first arm evaluate FLT early predictor tumor response therapy . Patients image FLT FDG PET start treatment , follow two cycle therapy treatment end . - The second arm evaluate ability FLT distinguish mass remain treatment active cancer dead tissue . Patients complete treatment FDG PET show remain tumor mass image FLT PET . Following scan , tumor biopsied verification .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - FLT PET/CT show correlate rate cellular/tumor proliferation . - The Imaging Subcommittee International Harmonization Project Lymphoma recommend perform FDG PET least 3 week , preferably 6-8 week chemotherapy chemoimmunotherapy therapy 8- 12 week radiation chemoradiation therapy due high FDG accumulation inflammatory tissue . - FLT uptake inflammatory lesion less prominent FDG likely FLT PET/CT well differentiate inflammation tumor . - FLT PET/CT image expect well differentiate treatment induced inflammation malignancy enable early prediction therapeutic response . - FLT PET/CT image expect differentiate residual inflammatory residual mass residual malignancy therefore guide appropriate treatment . Primary Objectives : - To estimate diagnostic accuracy FLT PET/CT early indicator complete response therapy B T cell lymphoma . - To estimate diagnostic accuracy FLT PET/CT evaluation residual mass therapy . Eligibility : - Participant must enrol lymphoma therapy study NIH Clinical Center OR enrol CALGB 50303 study another site OR undergo new course treatment lymphoma another facility . The NCI Laboratory Pathology confirm diagnosis subject enrol CALGB study site . - Participants must clinical course consistent lymphoma available documentation lymphoma either NCI outside pathology laboratory . - Subjects enrol early response arm must undergo baseline FLT PET prior receive new course lymphoma therapy . - Subjects enrol residual mass evaluation arm enrol time FDG avid residual mass discover ( i.e . pre-therapy FLT image require ) . - Subjects enroll arm study . - Participant must 18 year old . - ECOG Performance score 0 1 . - SGOT , SGPT le 5 time ULN . - bilirubin le equal 2 time ULN . Design : - There 2 arm study - The first arm ass FLT early predictor tumor response therapy ( treatment naive recurrent disease ) . Subjects image FLT FDG PET pre-therapy , follow 2 cycle therapy post therapy . - The second arm ass lymphoma patient FDG PET positive residual mass . Subjects image FLT PET prior standard care biopsy residual mass . If initial FDG PET data available DICOM format suboptimal image quality , repeat FDG PET/CT study site may require . - We accrue 70 participant ( 40 early response arm 30 residual mass arm ) study .</detailed_description>
