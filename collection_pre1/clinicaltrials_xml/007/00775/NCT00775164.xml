	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Therapy Obese Children With Insulin Resistance : A Randomized , Controlled Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Specific Aim/Hypothesis Obese , insulin resistant child increase risk future cardiovascular disease due elevate systolic blood pressure , fast insulin , triglyceride , inflammation , oxidative stress , reduce HDL cholesterol . Behavioral/lifestyle therapy foundational approach treat obesity insulin resistance individual , especially child . However , child may need concomitant medical therapy order adequately address severe risk factor profile early vascular abnormality . Although approved FDA , metformin use mixed success treat obesity-associated cardiometabolic risk factor child evidence insulin resistance . Clearly , drug therapy explore treat cardiovascular risk factor obese , insulin resistant child . Thiazolidinediones use improve glucose control adult patient type 2 diabetes mellitus approximately 10 year . These peroxisome proliferator activate receptor agonist unique among anti-diabetic agent regulate gene transcription improve insulin sensitivity peripheral tissue ( predominately skeletal muscle adipose tissue ) . In addition improve glycemic control , drug also improve multiple cardiometabolic risk factor lipoprotein profile , blood pressure , inflammatory marker , adipokines , endothelial function . Despite substantial body data show benefit adult , pioglitazone never evaluate therapy improve cardiometabolic risk factor profile obese child evidence insulin resistance . Specific Aim : To examine effect four month pioglitazone vs. metformin treatment HDL cholesterol , triglyceride , blood pressure , insulin resistance , endothelial function , arterial stiffness , adipokines , oxidative stress , blood biomarkers endothelial activation obese , insulin resistant child . Hypothesis : In context background behavioral therapy , four month pioglitazone vs. metformin treatment significantly improve HDL cholesterol , triglyceride , blood pressure , insulin resistance , endothelial function , arterial stiffness , adipokines , oxidative stress , blood biomarkers endothelial activation obese insulin resistant child . Significance There substantial lack data literature concern potential drug therapy reduce risk factor child high risk develop future cardiovascular disease . Since prevalence obesity insulin resistance child increase dramatically last several decade , urgent need data randomize , control trial guide treatment approach high risk child . This pilot study result acquisition valuable preliminary data use seek funding conduct large scale clinical trial evaluate efficacy pioglitazone treat cardiometabolic risk factor obese , insulin resistant child . Methods Patient Population : 30 obese , hyperinsulinemic child adolescent enter Pediatric Weight Management Program University Minnesota enrol . In program , child family work team train professional include physician , dietician , psychologist reduce weight make healthy eat choice increase physical activity . Study Design : This randomize , double-blind , active-comparator clinical trial . Variables assess baseline ( prior randomization ) four month therapy . Data Collection : The screen visit take place Pediatric Weight Management Clinic include complete medical history physical examination . All research test take place University Minnesota General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . Statistical Analysis Power Considerations : Randomization stratify gender Tanner stage . Changes group time compare 2X2 ( group time ) repeat measure ANOVA Bonferroni post-hoc test . The main analysis interest ANOVA interaction term , compare change variable time ( pre vs. post ) group . The purpose study obtain preliminary data design seek funding large clinical trial .</detailed_description>
