	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect possible exposure THROMBIN JMI® activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) 48 hour post surgery subject likelihood prior exposure THROMBIN JMI® within past 4 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study Assessing Impact Exposure THROMBIN-JMI® Coagulation Parameters .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study intend observe effect possible repeat exposure topical THROMBIN-JMI® aPTT . Adult men woman schedule undergo qualified surgery ( define surgery likely require use active topical hemostatic agent , likely require transfusion plasma ) , complete inform consent process , meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion eligible study . As observational study decision regard necessity treatment achieve hemostasis hemostatic product aid perioperative hemostasis determine surgeon base upon individual subject 's condition . Consequently , several assumption estimation make design study . It assume 20 % enrolled subject pre-surgery bovine thrombin antibody , 60 % receive THROMBIN JMI® study surgery , result approximately 75 subject primary study cohort 195 subject primary reference cohort . The primary endpoint aPTT choose prolongation beyond normal reference range indicate either factor deficiency presence inhibitor . The latter identify either correction partial correction mix study . At 48 hour post potential secondary exposure secondary immune response sufficiently mount see impact neutralize antibody aPTT . After completion study surgery , subject categorize cohort base whether pre-surgery plasmas anti-topical bovine thrombin antibodies whether subject receive receive THROMBIN JMI® intraoperatively . The primary study cohort subject anti-topical bovine thrombin antibodies pre-surgery , receive THROMBIN JMI® study surgery . The primary reference cohort subject anti-topical bovine thrombin antibodies pre-surgery receive THROMBIN JMI® study surgery . Antibody assessment perform end study subject .</detailed_description>
