	<detailed_description>The study conduct two phase follow : - The Phase II component study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-centre study perform France . After undergo NSCLC resection , 140 patient randomize receive either pazopanib 400 mg per day placebo 24 week . - The Phase III component study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-centre study perform internationally . Patients complete Phase II component study follow included Phase III . Additional patient also recruit planned total 355 patient per treatment arm . New patient randomize receive either pazopanib 400 mg per day placebo 24 week .</detailed_description>
