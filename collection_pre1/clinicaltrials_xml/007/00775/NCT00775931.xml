	<brief_summary>The purpose research explore believe may safer effective mean perform stem cell transplantation patient Osteopetrosis , use chemotherapy radiation design bring engraftment lessen transplant mortality . Prior multi-institutional data past study find approximately 30 % Osteopetrosis patient engraft . Therefore , study , utilize reduce intensity design pre-transplant drug try make transplant safer disease , well provide second infusion stem cell patient match related unrelated donor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Transplantation For Severe Osteopetrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This revise transplant protocol test following : 1 ) ability achieve engraftment reduce intensity protocol second infusion stem cell day 42 , 2 ) mortality associate transplant day 100 , 3 ) patient outcome , base differential image biologic evaluation prior transplantation designate point transplantation ( day 100 , 6 month , 1 , 2 5 year ) . Additional biologic study include microarray analysis , evaluation blood parameter gene may important disease process . In old patient , study evaluation osteoclast differentiation function also offer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible transplantation protocol &lt; = 45 year age , diagnose severe osteopetrosis . This define follow manifestation disease . 1 . Bones uniformly markedly dense base skeletal survey 2 . No history would suggest autosomal dominant inheritance 3 . Evidence hematologic change attribute underlying disease , include need ongoing transfusion , OR presence progressive anemia thrombocytopenia , OR white blood cell differential predominance immature form evidence extramedullary hematopoiesis , OR persistence serious infectious complication think due abnormal architecture bone resistant surgical medical intervention . Patients &gt; 45 year age Evidence hepatic failure Pulmonary dysfunction sufficient significantly increase risk transplant . Renal dysfunction glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 30 % predict . Cardiac compromise sufficient substantially increase risk transplantation Severe , stable neurologic impairment . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity .
