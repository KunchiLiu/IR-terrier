	<brief_summary>Interstitial cystitis ( IC ) /chronic pelvic pain syndrome ( CPPS ) clinical syndrome pelvic pain and/or urinary urgency/frequency absence specific cause bacterial infection damage bladder . The pathogenetic mechanism IC/CPPS yet undefined largely lack knowledge , preclude systematic therapeutic approach . Experimental evidence , include result animal model cystitis knock-out mouse , indicate participation tachykinin receptor , especially NK1R , neurogenic inflammation , consider important element IC complex . However , scant information molecular mechanism IC human , type receptor , participate neurogenic inflammation . Based molecular biological know-how clinical expertise , propose investigate role tachykinin bradykinin receptor signal partner CPPS bladder dysfunction human .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Inflammatory Contractile Protein Expression Patients With Painful Bladder Syndrome/IC .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although IC recognised century , pathophysiology remain mystery , consequence treatment IC largely empirical . A multitude mechanisms disease postulate range neuroinflammatory autoimmune possibly infectious toxic agent . Newer study hint towards genetic basis disease , hypotheses inflammatory component kind involve many finding support theory . An often-cited hypothesis leaky epithelium . The healthy bladder coat thin mucinous substance bladder surface mucin , compose numerous sulfonated glycosaminoglycans glycoprotein . In IC patient , contrast control , well animal model IC , qualitative change surface layer observe ( Lilly et al , 1990. , Moskowitz et al , 1994 ) . An initiating event ( toxin ) may lead functional change increase permeability . This turn lead nerve sensitisation possibly up-regulation . There increase evidence progression IC accompany significant up-regulation sensory nerve bladder ( Letourneau , 1996 ) . Nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , neurotropin sensitises nociceptor fibre , report increased bladder IC patient ( Lowe , 1997 ) , application NGF Wistar rat acutely induced bladder hyperactivity ( Chuang , 2001 ) . Sensory nerve neurogenic inflammation secrete inflammatory mediator Substance P ( SP ) , nociceptive neurotransmitter central peripheral nervous system . Increased amount release Substance P find urine IC patient ( Hohenfellner , et al,1992 , Pang et al. , 1995 , Pang et al. , 1996 ) , concentration Substance P reflect patient ' degree pain ( Chen et al. , 1999 ) . Substance P related tachykinins ( TKs ) mediate variety physiological process genitourinary , pulmonary gastrointestinal tract stimulation NK1 NK2 receptor . Pre-clinical evidence obtain use selective tachykinin receptor antagonists indicate endogenous tachykinins involve regulation smooth muscle contraction , vasodilation , water metabolism inflammation . Recently show mRNA encode SP receptor NK1 in-creased bladder biopsy patient interstitial cystitis ( Marchand et al. , 1998 ) . NK1R mRNA find detrusor muscle , urothelium vascular structure , endothelial NK1R markedly increase . SP bind NK1R endothelial cell result vasodilation , plasma extravasation , cytokine release activation infiltration immune cell , characteristic IC . Experiments NK1R knockout mouse allow first time demonstrate obligatory requirement NK1R cystitis participation receptor chain event link mast cell degranulation inflammation ( Saban et al. , 2000 ) . Changes sarcolemma , alter expression tachykinin bradykinin receptor might significantly influence downstream signal event lead propagation symptom chronic pelvic pain/IC . By uncover link clinical symptom molecular regulation atypical inflammatory response , may able offer novel specific option treatment . In current proposal , would like study urinary bladder pathology , particular symptomatic complex PBS/interstitial cystitis , investigate effect change human urothelium detrusor muscle cell NK1R-mediated signalling . Biopsies control PBS patient obtain either general spinal anesthesia transurethrally bladder dome trigone biopsy tong . RNA extract , expression level select gene analyze use Taqman real-time PCR gene expression array ( Applied Biosystems ) . Calcium image use monitor receptor activation protein level analyse SDS-PAGE Western Blotting . Receptor tissue distribution analyse immuno-cytochemistry .</detailed_description>
