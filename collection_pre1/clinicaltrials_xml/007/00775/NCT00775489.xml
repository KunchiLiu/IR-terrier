	<detailed_description>Systemic topical ophthalmic steroid long associate ocular effect , glaucoma cataract . Periocular steroid injection steroid apply periocular skin also report increase intraocular pressure ( IOP ) raise IOP major risk factor glaucoma . Approximately 18 36 % general population corticosteroid responder . This response increase 46 92 % patient primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) . Allergic rhinitis affect 30 % adult 40 % child United States . Topical nasal steroid effective treatment option.Nonallergic rhinitis common disease affect approximately 17 million person United States ; approximately 22 million combination allergic nonallergic rhinitis.Topical nasal steroid demonstrate efficacy treatment nonallergic rhinitis consider first-line empiric therapy.With perceive safety nasal steroid , use treatment upper respiratory allergy become common.However , inhale nasal steroid might absorb systemically . Although systemic absorption inhale nasal steroid establish , clinically relevant ocular side effect poorly define . A large prospective study 1995 Samiy et al report statistically significant increase IOP 187 patient without glaucoma take inhaled steroid various pulmonary condition . Similarly , large case-control study 1997 case suggest presence nasal steroid use patient newly diagnose glaucoma OHT versus nonglaucomatous patient statistically significant ( odds ratio , 1.02 ; 95 % CI , 0.59-1.77 ) . However , number patient take continuous high-dose nasal steroid small statistical analysis . In 1998 , small prospective study 26 non-glaucomatous patient reveal evidence OHT cataract prolong use nasal steroid endoscopic sinus surgery ( mean follow-up , 8.8 ± 3.6 month ; range , 3-19 month ) . A study 61 patient seasonal allergic rhinitis take nasal fluticasone 1 year show increase risk glaucoma.However , information describe regard glaucoma risk status steroid use study . Six case increase IOP associate combined nasal inhale steroid use non-glaucomatous patient report . Considering large number patient nasal steroid ; It surprise one investigate nasal steroid use contraindicate glaucoma patient .</detailed_description>
