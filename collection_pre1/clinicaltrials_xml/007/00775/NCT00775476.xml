	<brief_summary>Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) chronic inflammatory disease often debilitate potentially life-threatening consequence . The cause SLE unknown current therapy lack specificity carry significant side-effects . Existing data literature provide evidence natural antioxidant , glutathione , deplete T cell patient SLE . This may key factor underlie abnormal activation predisposition T lymphocytes pro-inflammatory cell death via necrosis . Administration N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , serve precursor glutathione ( GSH ) , improve clinical outcome murine lupus , limit toxicity pro-oxidant/immunosuppressant medication commonly use patient SLE . NAC widely available health food store large dos ( 8 g/day ) safely administer human . In one-year study patient inflammatory lung disease treat prednisone azathioprine , addition NAC ( 1.8 g/day ) diminish disease severity reduce drug toxicity comparison placebo . Moreover , oral NAC find improve muscle fatigue report disable symptom 53 % patient SLE . Thus , establish dose range 1.2-7.2 g/day well tolerate capable raise intracellular GSH lupus patient determine immunological therapeutic impact SLE appear well justify . The study consist two part , Aim 1 Aim 2 . AIM 1 : The purpose Aim 1 establish optimal daily oral dose NAC well tolerate without side effect normalize moderate depletion GSH lupus T cell . 36 SLE subject 42 healthy control ( match age sex ) study . The 36 SLE subject divide 3 group 12 . Each group receive different dose NAC ( N-acetylcysteine ) placebo follow : Group 1 : 9 receive 600mg NAC two time Day , 3 receive placebo ; Group 2 : 9 receive 1200mg NAC two time Day , 3 receive placebo ; Group 3 : 9 receive 2400mg NAC two time Day , 3 receive placebo ; To account attrition 12 subject randomize group ( 9 active , 3 placebo ) . At subject visit , blood healthy donor drawn use control . The control blood use flow cytometry measurement GSH vitro immunological study . In addition GSH measurement immunologic study , routine labs. , ASRS self-reporting assessment questionnaire , SLEDAI/BILAG/Fatigue score obtain SLE subject . The healthy control subject also answer ASRS self-reporting questionnaire . The ASRS questionnaire incorporate study procedure October , 2009 . It design assess patient 's ability concentrate could affect involvement Central Nervous System ( CNS ) lupus . There 5 study visit per SLE subject period four month . At visit 100 ml blood drawn subject . 20 ml need routine lab . 80 ml need GSH immunological test . Dose comparison base continuous monitor adverse event drug tolerance . AIM 2 : Aim 2 determine tolerance impact two NAC dos disease activity prednisone use 165 subject SLE double-blind placebo-controlled 12-month study . It design detect clinically meaningful difference disease activity patient population . It determine statistical analysis group must 55 subject . SLE subject randomize 3 group 55 subject receive 1.2 g NAC twice day , 2.4 g NAC twice day , placebo . There seven study visit per SLE subject , include screen wash visit . Visits 1-5 scheduled three month apart . The study last 13 month wash visit . Each subject donate approximately 80 ml blood research visit . Healthy control subject donate blood time . They match SLE subject gender , age within 10 year , ethnicity . Their blood use reference research assay . The inclusion exclusion criterion Aim 1 subject may continue participate . There new consent form require participate second phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Based analysis data obtain Aim 1 Safety Monitoring Board conclude meet April , 2011 Aim 2 proceed use two NAC dose arm instead one . Although fourth dose group originally propose Aim 1 , board decide proceed last dosing group 4800 mg NAC two time day . Per protocol , 75 % active subject dose need tolerate dose order proceed next high dose group . Although 100 % subject tolerate first second dos , 3 9 subject experienced transient nausea third dose . The board conclude NAC dose 1 0.6 g twice day ineffective dos 2 ( 1.2 g twice day ) 3 ( 2.4 g twice day ) provide benefit . All dose safe . The onset action efficacy dose 3 appear superior dose 2 . Lupus disease activity Aim 2 assess SLEDAI BILAG score , liver bone marrow function , overall fatigue . Sustained improvement T cell dysfunction , B cell subset , mitochondrial function production nitric oxide investigated immunological outcome . Both SLE Healthy control subject continue answer ASRS self-reporting questionnaire .</detailed_description>
