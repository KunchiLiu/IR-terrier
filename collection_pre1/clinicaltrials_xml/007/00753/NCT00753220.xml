	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine intra-tumoral injection subject 's dendritic cell cryotherapy prostate safe effective treatment advance prostate cancer . In theory , inject dendritic cell internalize antigen tumor cell damage cryotherapy activate subject 's immune system specific tumor . Subjects also receive low dose chemotherapy design low number T-regulatory cell show low stop immune system response . Hypothesis 1 : Dendritic cell injection cryotreated prostate cancer non-toxic ; Hypothesis 2 : Dendritic cell injection cryotreated prostate cancer medically beneficial subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Autologous Dendritic Cells Injected Into Prostate After Cryoablation Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study treatment dendritic cell ( VDC2008 ) inject prostate follow prostatic cryoablation . It speculate antigen cryoablated cancer available vicinity cryoablation field immediately following procedure . Autologous , immature dendritic cell capable internalize antigen , migrate lymphatic system , present antigenic epitope T lymphocytes . In way , dendritic cell capable initiate cell-mediated systemic immune response . In concept , cancer provide specific potentially broad spectrum cancer-related antigen . Regulatory T lymphocytes , implicate dampen halt cell-mediated , antigen-specific immune response , selectively deplete use regimen low-dose cyclophosphamide . Low-dose cyclophosphamide empirically show selectively deplete number circulate regulatory T cell . Using combination therapy , think clinically significant anti-cancer immune response might elicit .</detailed_description>
