	<brief_title>Tolerability Hypertonic Saline Infants With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis lung disease characterize mucous retention favor secondary bacterial infection inflammation , lead lung damage ultimately respiratory failure . Classically , therapeutic intervention aim improve mucociliary clearance , reduce bacterial load lower airway inflammation . Hypertonic saline ( HS ) use induction sputum production age group obtain secretion low respiratory diagnostic purpose . Hypertonic saline also use old child CF , produce sputum spontaneously , obtain representative sample microbiology . There evidence study patient cystic fibrosis HS improve mucociliary clearance . The improvement impressive area well ventilate , make likely HS work well patient relatively preserve pulmonary function . Newer evidence also suggest osmotic effect airway surface expect short live , may actually persist long time period ( 8 hour ) . All data indicate HS may useful agent treatment CF patient . As effect mucociliary clearance find good area adequate ventilation , logical assume treatment HS may efficacious initiate early disease process . So far , data tolerability inhalation HS available infant cystic fibrosis . However , evidence infant AIDS well recent study infant bronchiolitis suggest hypertonic saline safely administer inhalation infant . Nevertheless , proof tolerability CF infants prerequisite long term study HS age group . In old child , tolerability test measure pulmonary function inhalation HS saline . Similar data yet available infant .</detailed_description>
