	<brief_summary>This open label , single-center , feasibility study comprise two sequential cohort ( cohort 1 : 2 participant ; cohort 2 : 8 participant ) . This study conduct generally healthy participant age 25 55 year non-morbid obesity pre-screening body mass index 35 40 . Participants undergo screen determine health status eligibility participate study . Eligible patient undergo endoscopic device delivery procedure device anchor inner stomach wall distal anterior antrum . Physical examination and/or endoscopic safety evaluation conduct day 14 28 . The device anchor completely remove endoscopically 8 week . The participant followed-up safety evaluation additional period 2 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>METHOD ( Minimally Invasive , Endoscopically-delivered , Tolerable Human Individuals , Non-morbid Obesity Device ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective safe method require achieve substantial long-lasting weight-loss minimal preferably impact non-morbid obese individual ' pre-procedure lifestyle . The current available treatment obesity general non-morbid obesity particular , , part , ineffective long run associate material adverse event potentially lethal complication . Sensate™ , endoscopically-delivered , inner-stomach-wall-anchored , low-profile device ( practically exact size shape famous Given Imaging PillCam™ swallowable device ) , advantageous comparison open minimally invasive surgical method treat obesity . The reason simple endoscopic delivery , inner-antrum-wall-anchoring removal procedure safe , minimally-invasive , require minimal participant sedation ( deep anesthesia ) , require unique gastroenterologist skill , do outpatient clinic setting like hospital setting . Moreover , Sensate™ design modestly reduce food consumption concurrently generation great satiety , thus maintain balance healthy weight loss long period time without mandate complementary radical lifestyle change nutritional change proven hard impractical obese individual . This study first study human , focus examine validate safety , tolerability preliminary efficacy Sensate™ human . The Sensate™ study comprise two sequential cohort generally healthy patient non-morbid obesity , two participant first cohort eight subject second cohort . The first cohort start 2 subject , order validate absolute safety device delivery additional subject recruit . The sample size minimal one require collect safety , tolerability preliminary efficacy data . Participants undergo screen determine health status eligibility participate study . Screening examination include medical history , physical examination , vital sign , weight measurement laboratory assessment . Eligible patient undergo endoscopic device delivery procedure device anchor inner stomach wall distal anterior antrum . Patients request complete detail daily diary base visual analogue scale ( VAS ) record eat sensation meal throughout study . Physical examination , record adverse event weight measurement conduct day 14 28 . In addition , phone call make every week study period ask patient health alteration . Endoscopic safety evaluation validate device anchor properly safety issue perform Days 14 28 first two subject day 28 remain eight subject . The device anchor completely remove endoscopically 8 week . The participant followed-up safety evaluation additional period 2 week . Safety evaluation include physical examination , vital sign , adverse event laboratory assessment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female participant , 25 year age old 55 year age young time first screen visit . BMI ( Body Mass Index ) prior first screen visit 35 40 kg/m2 . General good health confirm medical history , physical examination , medication use 30 day prior baseline visit , clinical chemistry hematology lab test result . For woman childbearing potential : negative pregnancy test willingness use effective contraception entire study period . Signed informed consent participate study . Ability participant comply requirement study participate intensive activity study throughout study period . Any contraindication undergo endoscopic and/or laparoscopic procedure . Known gastric motility disorder and/or history chronic constipation problem . Known peptic ulcer and/or previous gastrointestinal antrum and/or pyloric surgery ( open laparoscopic ) and/or structural abnormality gastrointestinal tract ( drop criterion ) . History chronic intestinal disease disorder . Prior obesity prevention surgical procedure ( intragastric balloon , Lap band™ procedure , Bariatric surgery others ) . Significant weight fluctuation ( great ±5 kg ) within period three month prior first screen visit . Participants significant eating pattern alteration accord participant interview . Current systemic intake laxative , steroid , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication , anticoagulant within 30 day prior screen visit entire study duration . Participants clinically significant unstable medical surgical condition may preclude safe complete study participation . Such condition include significant gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , vascular disease , pulmonary/respiratory , hepatic impairment , renal , metabolic disease , endocrinological , neurological , immunedeficiency , hematopoietic disease , malignancy determine medical history , physical examination , laboratory test . Participants clinically significant abnormality upon physical examination clinical laboratory test value abnormal blood test abnormal blood coagulation test result prior baseline visit . Participants acute medical situation ( e.g . severe febrile illness ) uncontrollable infection , consider significant Principal Investigator . Participants participate another clinical trial kind within three month prior screen visit . Organ allograft . For female participant : plan pregnancy within 6 month study start , active pregnancy , breastfeed . For male participant : intention child within 6 month baseline visit . Any form substance abuse ( include drug alcohol abuse ) , psychiatric disorder , chronic condition susceptible , opinion investigator , interfere conduct study . Participants likely noncompliant uncooperative study .</criteria>
