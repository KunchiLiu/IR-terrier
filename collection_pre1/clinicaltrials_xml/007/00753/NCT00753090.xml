	<brief_title>Vanguard™ Deep Dish Rotating Platform Knee Clinical Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate safety efficacy Vanguard™ Deep Dish Rotating Platform Knee ( mobile bearing knee ) compare Vanguard Cruciate Retaining Knee ( fix bear knee ) . This trial conduct randomise , control study . Implant loosen polyethylene wear fixed-bearing knee prosthesis recognize major cause late failure . The mobile bearing knee theoretical advantage potentially minimize polyethylene wear reduce implant bone interface stress order reduce incidence implant loosening . Therefore , aim study prove Vanguard deep dish rotate platform knee least effective clinical outcome widely use current design knee replacement well long term survivorship . The efficacy device determine relief pain , restoration function range motion . The durability device determine absence revision/removal radiological integrity . To assess safety device , post operative complication record either device related otherwise . Patient satisfaction determine answer patient outcome questionnaire ( Oxford Knee Score , WOMAC Lower Extremity Activity Scale ) .</detailed_description>
