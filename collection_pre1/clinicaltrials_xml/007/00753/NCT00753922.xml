	<detailed_description>Silicone gel-filled breast implant introduce early sixty wide-scale distribution time Medical Device Amendments Food Drug Cosmetic Act pass 1976 . In 1983 , gel-filled breast implant designate Class III device require premarket approval . In May 1990 , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) publish propose request ( 515 ( b ) ) Premarket Approval Applications ( PMA ) April 1991 publish final request . This final publication put manufacturer gel-filled breast implant notice continue market gel-filled breast implant , PMA due FDA 90 day final publication date . A premarket approval ( PMA ) Mentor gel-filled breast implant file FDA July 1991 . At FDA General Plastic Surgery Advisory Committee meet November 1991 , committee recommend submission additional information establish safety effectiveness gel-filled breast implant . In January 1992 , FDA Commissioner announce voluntary moratorium sale gel-filled breast implant allow advisory panel time assess additional information . In April 1992 , moratorium lift reconstruction revision patient . Every patient implant part adjunct study , offer participation registry gel-filled breast implant patient . In order implant gel-filled implant augmentation , woman enrol core clinical study . The objective study determine safety effectiveness smooth textured surface Mentor Round Low-Bleed Silicone Gel-filled Mammary Prostheses woman undergo primary breast augmentation , primary breast reconstruction revision .</detailed_description>
