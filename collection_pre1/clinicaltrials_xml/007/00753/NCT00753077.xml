	<brief_summary>Oral appliance , maintain patient ' jaw forward sleep , become popular treat obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . However , exact mechanism mandible forward upper airway completely know . In study use static dynamic MRI study 3D morphological change dynamic behavior upper respiratory tract different mandible posit . Because asian society non-obese OSA patient uncommonly see , study focus non-obese severe OSA patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three Dimensional Morphology Upper Respiratory Tract Mandibular Position Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study analyze upper airway morphology change dynamic movement different section affect mandible position use dynamic static magnet resonance imaging technique . The study also discuss formation mechanism obstructive sleep apnea syndrome function mechanism oral appliance , well evaluation clinical result oral appliance non-obese male patient severe obstructive sleep apnea Taiwan . 10 non-obese ( BMI &lt; 25 ) severe OSA ( AHI＞30 ) male patient age 20 60 10 gender , BMI age match control ( AHI＜5 ) recruit study . Nine bite index make different mandible position subject . Upper airway image use static dynamic MRI subject wear bite index lie MRI scan table . This study also measure circumference take lateral cephalometric imaging subject . Oral appliance make fitted experimental group subject , wear three month , transfer Sleep Center underwent PSG examination evaluate therapeutic effect appliance .</detailed_description>
