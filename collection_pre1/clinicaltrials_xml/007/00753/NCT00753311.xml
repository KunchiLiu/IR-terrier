	<brief_summary>Triptans first choice drug acute treatment migraine cluster headache . However , cluster headache response rate subcutaneous sumatriptan 96 % , around 30 % patient fail respond particular triptan . Nonresponse likely due variety factor , include low inconsistent absorption , inadequate dosing , variability individual response5 . Timing administration also crucial issue . In fact , early treatment attack , pain still mild , may increase responder rate circumvent development cutaneous allodynia ( expression central sensitization pain pathway ) course attack . Several study perform attempt genetically , psychologically clinically characterize triptan responder fail provide conclusive result . Nevertheless , suggest presence UAs migraine attack might predict good response triptans . UAs common migraine patient . They report almost one two migraineurs ( 45.8 % ) attend tertiary headache centre one four ( 26.9 % ) population-based study . In open study sumatriptan 50 mg perform 72 migraine patient UAs , describe pain relief 65.3 % patient 1 h 81.9 % 2 h , pain-free 30.6 % 1 h 61.1 % 2 h. We hypothesize large-scale recruitment peripheral neurovascular 5-HT1B/1D receptor consequent activation trigeminal-autonomic reflex patient . Our hypothesis receive confirmation demonstration high level calcitonin gene-related peptide , neurokinin A vasoactive intestinal peptide ( hallmark activation trigeminal autonomic reflex ) external jugular blood rizatriptan responder non-responders . The investigator therefore postulate migraineurs UAs may respond good rizatriptan `` general '' migraine population . The aim study evaluate efficacy rizatriptan 10 mg lyophilize wafer ( MLT ) compare placebo treatment acute migraine patient unilateral autonomic symptom ( UAs : unilateral lacrimation , eye redness , eyelid oedema , nasal congestion rhinorrhoea , miosis ptosis , forehead facial sweating ) migraine attack .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We test hypothesis presence unilateral cranial autonomic symptom migraine predicts good response triptans . In randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study 80 migraineurs unilateral cranial autonomic symptom assign rizatriptan 10 mg wafer placebo ( ratio 1:1 ) treat single moderate severe migraine attack . The primary endpoint pain freedom 2 h total migraine freedom 2 h. Secondary endpoint include pain relief , associate symptom sustain pain freedom relief . Significantly patient report pain freedom 2 h take rizatriptan placebo ( 54 % vs 8 % ; p &lt; 0.001 ) . Similarly , significantly patient report total migraine freedom 2 h rizatriptan placebo ( 51 % vs 8 % ; p &lt; 0.001 ) . Rizatriptan also effective placebo secondary endpoint . Migraineurs unilateral cranial autonomic symptom respond well general migraine population rizatriptan , probably owe intense trigeminal peripheral afferent activation strongly recruit peripheral neurovascular 5-HT1B/1D receptor . Acute preventive pharmacological trial migraine focus also subset migraine patient .</detailed_description>
