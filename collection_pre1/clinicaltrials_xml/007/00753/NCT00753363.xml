	<brief_summary>Persistent low-grade inflammation impair fibrinolysis , independent predictor several chronic disease highly prevalent old Veteran population include cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , stroke , diabetes . Inflammation likely causative underlie mechanism insulin resistance . Lifestyle change weight loss physical activity advocate treatment chronic diseases endpoint , data emerge suggest treatment may beneficial , part , due anti-inflammatory effect . Identification effective therapy reduce chronic inflammation Veterans important give widespread adverse health effect chronically elevate inflammatory state .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study compare effect 6 month trial aerobic exercise ( AEX ) vs. weight loss ( WL ) old individual : 1. adipokine secretion expression ( tumor necrosis factor alpha , adiponectin ) ; 2. adipose tissue skeletal muscle inflammatory proximal receptor expression ( adiponectin tumor necrosis factor alpha expression ) signal pathway ; 3. whether change signal transduction associate change peripheral whole body insulin sensitivity hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp . The prevention treatment insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome , CVD complication exercise weight loss could improve Veterans ' health reduce health care cost . Knowledge effectiveness important implication cardiovascular health Veterans give widespread adverse health effect chronic inflammation vascular biology , skeletal muscle function insulin action .</detailed_description>
