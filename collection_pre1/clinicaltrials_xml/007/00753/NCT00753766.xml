	<detailed_description>Patients diabetes require hospitalization increase risk morbidity mortality , especially undergoing surgery . There evidence intensive glucose management hospitalization may improve outcome . However , study evaluate intensive diabetes treatment hospitalization . Preliminary data patient vascular surgery show diabetes long hospital stay , frequent wound infection , likely require return operating room compare patient without diabetes . In particular , insulin-treated patient even great peri-operative complication non-insulin treat patient diabetes . However , data also suggest clinical trial test hypothesis pre-operative intensive management significant impact peri-operative complication would require large number participant adequate power . Thus , objective conduct pilot feasibility study determine whether intervention involve intensive pre-operative diabetes management successfully implement ass whether trend benefit observe . The result trial support conduct definitive study test effectiveness intervention large sample patient . This randomize , parallel group clinical trial insulin-treated patient diabetes mellitus schedule elective vascular surgery . We randomize 46 participant diabetes mellitus : insulin-treated HbA1c 7.5 % treated oral agent elevate HbA1c schedule vascular surgery 6 week pre-operative delay pose substantial medical risk , determine staff surgeon . We exclude individual markedly elevate HbA1c blood pressure ; recently manifest cardiovascular disease , unable attend regularly schedule follow-up visit pre-operative period . Participants randomize either continue usual care participate multifactorial intervention conduct 6-week period . During intervention period , participant meet care manager and/or endocrinologist least 3 occasion telephone follow-up visit . They receive instruction lifestyle modification ; measure glucose blood pressure home ( include use continuous glucose monitoring device 2 occasion ) , receive care management optimize glucose , blood pressure , lipid lowering , appropriate . The primary outcome measure percent screen participant eligible choose participation Secondary end point include : participant adherence study protocol , change baseline A1c fructosamine , occurrence wind infection 30-day peri-operative period , composite death cardiovascular cause , non-fatal myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass grafting , percutaneous coronary intervention , nonfatal stroke , amputation result peripheral ischemia ; length hospital stay ; rate return operate room .</detailed_description>
