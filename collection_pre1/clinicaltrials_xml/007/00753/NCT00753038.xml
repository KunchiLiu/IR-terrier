	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study REOLYSIN® Combination With Paclitaxel Carboplatin Patients With Head Neck Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Squamous cell carcinoma head neck sixth common cancer world . More 50 % patient diagnose advanced regional disease relapse locally distant site . Initial therapeutic option include irradiation , surgery chemotherapy . The commonly used agent cisplatin carboplatin , generally combination 5-FU taxane . Erbitux recently approve use first-line radiation second-line monotherapy . Only third patient respond first-line platinum-based therapy median overall survival 6-9 month . Preliminary assessment Phase 1 study conduct UK investigate combination REOLYSIN® , carboplatin paclitaxel suggest patient head neck carcinoma may represent group patient treatment combination active . This Phase 2 study design characterize efficacy safety REOLYSIN® give intravenously combination paclitaxel carboplatin every 3 week patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Response primary endpoint trial . Patients clinically evaluated course treatment radiologically every cycle . A complete partial response must confirm least 4 week first assessment document response every two cycle thereafter . The safety paclitaxel , carboplatin REOLYSIN® combination assess evaluation type , frequency severity adverse event , change clinical laboratory test , immunogenicity physical examination . Patients may continue receive therapy protocol , provide experience either progressive disease unacceptable drug-related toxicity respond either supportive care dose reduction .</detailed_description>
