	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lapatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , epirubicin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lapatinib together epirubicin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose epirubicin give together lapatinib treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess safety tolerability fixed-dose lapatinib ditosylate combination epirubicin hydrochloride patient metastatic breast cancer . - To determine optimally-tolerated regimen patient . Secondary - To determine clinical efficacy regimen patient . - To analyze pharmacokinetic data regimen . - To determine biomarkers correlate clinical benefit response lapatinib ditosylate patient . Tertiary - To identify tumor-derived blood-derived biomarkers correlate predictive clinical response benefit lapatinib ditosylate patient . - To determine level IGF-IR phosphorylated IGF-IR tumor tissue . - To determine expression pattern protein associate drug resistance may clinically active patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study epirubicin hydrochloride . Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate follow epirubicin hydrochloride IV 15-30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 7 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic analysis via liquid chromatography-mass spectometry ( LC-MS ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow 28 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
