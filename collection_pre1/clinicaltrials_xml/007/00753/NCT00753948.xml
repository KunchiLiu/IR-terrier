	<brief_summary>Previously observe individual tetraplegia reduce baseline airway caliber exhibit non-specific airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) . In person tetraplegia suggest due override cholinergic airway tone . In asthma , mechanism underlie bronchoconstriction AHR closely tie airway inflammation . Whether AHR tetraplegia also relate chronic airway inflammation unknown . Recently , non-invasive technique assess airway inflammation establish asthma involves measurement nitric oxide ( NO ) concentration ( FeNO ) expire air . FeNO elevate asthma likely due excess NO production inflammatory cell within airway Measurement FeNO person tetraplegia would help assess role airway inflammation population . This may therapeutic significance individual . NO lung felt principal inhibitory neurotransmitter non-adrenergic , non-cholinergic ( NANC ) system . It think inhalation NO effect airway tone healthy individual reduces methacholine responsiveness weak direct bronchodilatory effect asthmatic . The primary purpose study determine level exhale NO ( FeNO ) individual chronic cervical spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , compare obtain age sex match able-bodied individual subject stable mild moderate asthma . If FeNO level high comparable find asthmatic subject , imply role chronic inflammation reduce baseline airway caliber non-specific airway hyper-responsiveness ( AHR ) exhibit individual chronic cervical SCI . If FeNO level comparable find able-bodied control , support previous statement unopposed cholinergic innervation responsible low baseline airway caliber AHR individual chronic tetraplegia . Further scientific conclusion NO role control airway tone , pulmonary resistance blood pressure draw upon intravenous inhaled administration L-NAME . This compound show promising result treatment prevention orthostatic hypotension individual tetraplegia . Knowing effect airways potential easy mode delivery ( inhalation vs. intravenous ) utmost importance .</brief_summary>
