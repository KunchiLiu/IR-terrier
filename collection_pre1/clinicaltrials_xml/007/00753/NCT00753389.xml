	<brief_summary>This Germany-wide , multi-center , epidemiologic study design evaluate incidence post-operative/anesthesia effect muscle relaxant ( i.e . post-operative residual curarization : PORC ) effect patient outcome . Aside biometric data , type operation , use muscle relaxant neuromuscular monitoring , patient clinically evaluated operation post-anesthesia care unit . To look long-term effect , patient followed-up 28 day operation/anesthesia regard post-operative/anesthesia morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Muscle relaxant integral part modern anesthesia . They optimize intubate condition , reduce laryngeal trauma improve operating condition . Drawback possible pharmacological ( muscle relax ) effect drug beyond end operation ( i.e . post-operative residual curarization : PORC ) . PORC relevant complication general anesthesia . Reportedly 30 % patient receive muscle relaxant show sign PORC arrive post-anesthesia care unit . PORC comprise risk impair post-operative fine motor coordinative skill possible impairment swallow pharyngeal secretion increase risk aspiration extubation . Possible deleterious effect could pneumonia , bronchitis , myocardial infarction , cardiac insufficiency , stoke re-operation . In pilot study able identify clinical assessment criterion assess patient ' risk aspiration , part post-anesthesia evaluation every patient . Unfortunately major pitfall arise inability clearly identify PORC . Although objective neuromuscular monitoring golden standard measure neuromuscular transmission anesthesia , clinical sign use identify muscle weakness postoperatively . One reason practice vary action muscle relaxant different muscle group demonstrate neuromuscular monitoring insufficiently sensitive detect PORC symptom pharyngeal muscle . This situation may lead seldom use neuromuscular monitoring device may add decrease use muscle relaxant clinical anesthesia . In Germany-wide , multi-center , epidemiologic study would like evaluate use muscle relaxant , sign prolong effect beyond end operation/anesthesia ( PORC ) , affect in-hospital stay post-operative morbidity mortality . The sample 8 German hospital determine number patient clinically relevant sign muscle weakness time arrival post-anesthesia care unit . Therefore data entry form develop principal sub-investigators 8 participate study hospital . This data entry form enable staff charge post-anesthesia care unit acquire document residual neuromuscular blockade . The sample do 8 participate hospital 21 randomize working day period 24 hour . To identify potential risk factor postoperative residual curarization , know predictor neuromuscular rest blockade record well . Known predictor example : type amount muscle relaxant , duration operation anesthesia , surgical procedure , patient ' age , anesthesia-technique , antagonization muscle relaxant neuromuscular monitoring . Further , patient ' progress post-anesthesia care unit document . The 28 day outcome patient follow second data entry form include health-economical aspect . Reported complication , duration intensive care unit hospital stay , well remain health damage time discharge . To estimate significance PORC , data patient PORC compare data patient without PORC . These patient recruit first data collection period post-anesthesia care unit . The control patient PORC next one arrive post-anesthesia care unit without PORC .</detailed_description>
