	<detailed_description>Stroke third large cause death heart disease cancer Malaysia . It estimate 52,000 Malaysians suffer stroke annually . In 2005 , 3245 case stroke fatal . It project number fatal stoke case exceed 25,000 2020 . It find nanomolar concentration , α-tocotrienol α-tocopherol prevent glutamate-induced neuron cell death mouse inhibition c-Src kinase 12-lipoxygenase . Tocotrienol-supplemented rat show protection stroke-induced injury compare matched control . White matter lesion detect magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) closely related vascular event brain . MRI histopathological study show large white matter lesion usually conform usual area infarct actually represent area subclinical infarct . In addition positive correlation white matter lesion establish vascular risk factor . The Rotterdam Scan Study show elderly people silent brain infarct white matter lesion strongly increase risk clinical stroke , could explain major stroke risk factor alone . Several recent study show white matter lesion may independent prognostic measure future stroke risk . White matter hyperintensities detect MRI closely related vascular event brain instance represent subclinical infarct . It therefore conceivable study neuroprotective property tocotrienol supplementation human look serial change white matter disease load . Tocotrienol supplementation bring various favourable effect include improve lipid profile , lower thromboxane B2 platelet factor 4 reduce LDL oxidation . Carotid artery MR angiography establish robust technique evaluation carotid artery stenosis . Therefore , study anti-atherogenic effect tocotrienols supplementation , serial MR angiography carotid arteries do . Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) emerge fully understood , aetiology significance , liver disorder . FLD report common cause chronic liver disease U.S.A. western country prevalence rate range 15 % 30 % adult population . However , limited data available Malaysia . US image provide valuable information liver condition sensitivity 93-100 % . Frequently NAFLD associate dyslipidemia , obesity , insulin resistance type II diabetes represent liver component metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) . Patients NAFLD report low level serum vitamin E. NAFLD patient present significant increase cardiovascular ( CV ) risk , thus link NAFLD , MetS accelerate atherosclerosis .</detailed_description>
