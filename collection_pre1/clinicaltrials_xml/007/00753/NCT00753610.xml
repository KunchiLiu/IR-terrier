	<detailed_description>Invasive carcinoma uterine cervix remain common invasive cancer woman many country . Concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) recommend standard treatment locally advance high-risk cervical carcinoma ( 1-3 ) . Although local control rate survival improve use CCRT , treatment cause great toxicity bone marrow normal tissue compare cause conventional RT . Our previous study demonstrate serial change serum cytokine chemoradiation correlate tumor regression treatment morbidity . The sudden elevation serum TGF-beta 1 VEGF level first fraction brachytherapy correlate development great RT morbidity . Higher pretreatment TGF-beta 1 VEGF level associate poor tumor response chemoradiation ( 4 ) . It implicate angiogenic factor , VEGF , may play role toxicity outcome CCRT . However , still lack surrogate marker prediction clinical outcome CCRT . The commonly use chemotherapeutic drug combine radiation radiosensitizers cis-platinum 5-fluorouracil . These drug , especially cis-platinum , toxic kidney , myelosuppressive prone cause life-threatening neutropenia , anemia thrombocytopenia , severe radiotherapy alone ( 1-3 ) . To avoid unnecessary over-treatment , optimization CCRT critical importance . Herein , development surrogate marker monitoring treatment efficacy well toxicity pivotal optimize CCRT . Angiogenesis heavily regulate process , involve complex interaction inhibitory stimulatory angiogenic factor . It essential tumor growth , progression metastasis correlate poor prognosis cancer patient include cervical cancer ( 5 ) . Many novel compound , EGCG ( 6 ) , potently inhibit formation neoplastic blood vessel recently develop . There increase interest develop angiogeneis-suppressive agent cancer treatment grow number anti-angiogenesis drug currently evaluate clinical trial various malignancy . Promising result report include increase overall survival reduction risk death ( Bevacizumab ) , reversal cellular drug resistance ( Cetuximab ) activity second-line therapy colorectal cancer patient exhaust available treatment option ( Cetuximab , ABX-EGF , PTK-787 , Gefitinib , Erlotinib ) ( 7,8 ) . Although therapeutic role angiogenesis target therapy approve cancer treatment , way optimize dose angiogenesis inhibitor remain determined lack reliable surrogate marker tumor angiogenesis . Shaked et al . report level circulate endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) , contribute tumor vessel formation , reflect anti-tumor efficacy anti-angiogenesis regimen ( 9,10 ) . Growing evidence suggest level circulate EPC reflect response chemotherapy animal model clinical trial ( 11-13 ) . Thus , circulate EPC use marker optimize monitor anti-angiogenesis therapy include angiogenesis inhibitor chemotherapy . Circulating endothelial cell ( CEC ) , especially apoptotic CEC , observe increase breast cancer patient clinical benefit ( defined clinical response stable disease ) metronomic therapy ( 14 ) . Preclinical model indicate source apoptotic CEC likely tumor vasculature ( 14 ) . Whether circulate EPC CEC serve marker CCRT efficacy toxicity cervical cancer remain undetermined . Since CCRT standard treatment locally advance high-risk cervical cancer , development surrogate marker monitor CCRT response optimize treatment intensity , , important .</detailed_description>
