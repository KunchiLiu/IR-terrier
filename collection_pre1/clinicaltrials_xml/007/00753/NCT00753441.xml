	<brief_summary>The prognosis patient unresectable pancreatic cancer dismal . Hence , palliation tumor-associated symptom , particular jaundice due low bile duct obstruction gastric outlet obstruction , primary aim patient ' care . Endoscopic stenting surgical bypass currently two compete treatment option . There currently randomize trial compare recently develop metal stent surgical bypass . Furthermore , limit data quality life patient receive either therapy . While endoscopic stenting represent less invasive treatment , surgery may provide good long-term control require one-time treatment . Due incomplete evidence present randomize controlled trial design compare quality life patient undergo endoscopic stenting demand surgical bypass palliation symptom cause cancer pancreatic head require low bile duct obstruction .</brief_summary>
