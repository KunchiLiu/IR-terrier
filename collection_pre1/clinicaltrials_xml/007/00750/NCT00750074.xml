	<brief_summary>There two fundamentally different way ventilate critically ill patient : constant flow , volume-preset mode ( volume assist-control ) pressure-preset mode ( pressure-control pressure-support ) . Critically ill patient suffer mechanical derangement respiratory system raise work breathe . Knowledge mechanical property useful diagnostically measure response treatment time . It propose constant flow , volume-preset mode able offer diagnostic information change subject 's lung term resistance elastance property . This study propose examine similar information extract pressure-preset mode compare information mode ventilation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To compare respiratory system resistance elastance obtain constant-flow , volume-preset ventilation ( use conventional mean ) pressure-preset ventilation ( analyze slope flow versus time waveform , describe ) . Aim 2 : To determine whether patient effort level alertness impair accuracy resistance elastance measurement pressure-preset ventilation . Hypothesis 1 : Our primary hypothesis flow versus time waveform contain information sufficient calculate respiratory system resistance elastance . To test primary hypothesis , propose measure resistance elastance subject ventilate ICU assist-control ventilation ( standard constant flow , volume-preset mode ) . Then record flow versus time waveform pressure-preset ventilation . By extrapolate flow versus time waveform ( generally linear ) time axis , one calculate elastance since zero flow , alveolar pressure equal ventilator inspiratory pressure . Then Ers = ( Pinsp - Total PEEP ) /Extrapolated VT , Pinsp set inspiratory pressure extrapolate VT tidal volume inspiratory time sufficient allow equilibration patient ventilator ( use trigonometry ) . Similarly , extrapolate flow versus time waveform flow axis ( find maximal flow ) , one calculate resistance , assume flow depends pressure difference ventilator patient square resistance . We compare value derive pressure-preset ventilation determine assist-control ( take true value ) . Hypothesis 2 : We hypothesize inspiratory effort sufficient subject distort flow versus time waveform would see patient passive , lead erroneous value resistance elastance . We estimate respiratory drive use standard measure , fall Pao brief inspiratory occlusion 100ms follow onset inspiration ( P0.1 ) . Further , measure subject 's alertness Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale ( RASS ) . We expect estimation resistance elastance less accurate ( pressure-preset ventilation compare assist-control ) subject great respiratory drive high level alertness .</detailed_description>
