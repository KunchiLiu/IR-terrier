	<brief_title>Efficacy &amp; Safety Study Evaluating Natural Eggshell Membrane ( NEM ) Treatment Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) prevalent form arthritis estimate affect nearly 27 million adult U.S. , one third 65 old diagnose OA . As population age , estimate expect grow rapidly . Traditional treatment OA primarily attempt address symptom ( pain , inflammation , discomfort ) associate disease . This usually involve use analgesic ( i.e . acetaminophen , tramadol ) , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) ( i.e . ibuprofen , diclofenac ) , cyclooxygenase-2-specific ( COX-2 ) NSAIDs ( i.e . celecoxib ) alone combination . Steroid hyaluronic acid injection also use success . Many treatment show limited effectiveness randomize controlled clinical trial ( RCTs ) . To avoid cardiac risk gastrointestinal issue associate traditional OA treatment ( particularly long-term use ) , many patient turn complementary alternative medicine ( CAMs ) dietary supplement . The discovery eggshell membrane natural source combine glucosamine , chondroitin , hyaluronic acid prompt evaluation material potential treatment OA . ESM Technologies , LLC ( Carthage , MO ) develop method efficiently effectively separate eggshell membrane eggshell create shell-free eggshell membrane . The isolated membrane partially hydrolyze use proprietary process dry-blended produce 100 % pure Natural Eggshell Membrane ( NEM速 ) . In preliminary open-label human clinical trial total 37 subject OA , oral supplementation 500 mg per day NEM速 result observed decrease pain 7-30 day . Therefore , eight week randomize , multicenter , double blind , placebo control supplementation trial conduct evaluate efficacy safety NEM速 relief pain stiffness associate moderate OA knee - Osteoarthritis Pain Treatment IncorpOrating NEM速 ( OPTION ) trial .</detailed_description>
