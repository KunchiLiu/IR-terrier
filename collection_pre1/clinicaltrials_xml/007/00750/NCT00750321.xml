	<brief_summary>Chronic musculoskeletal pain major problem society . Treatments people musculoskeletal pain limited efficacy . Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) commonly utilized , non-invasive treatment pain safe non-pharmacological treatment utilized treatment musculoskeletal pain . Recent study animal PIs laboratory begin examine mechanism action TENS . The current study propose translate finding animal human subject . One concern TENS appropriate placebo . Since TENS delivers electrical current skin produce pain relief , patient typically feel stimulation electrode . The standard placebo prior clinical study utilize unit appear function ( light ) deliver current . In case subject would feel stimulation . We compare standard placebo new device current deliver 30 second slowly ramp . This current would felt subject intensity set , would slowly ramp . Thus , electrical current felt subject . It common people adapt TENS current long feel stimulation time , stimulation felt low intensity . This new placebo TENS would appear mimic event subject . This new TENS would advantage able double-blind study therapist apply treatment , subject receive treatment unaware receive active treatment . The investigator therefore test adequacy placebo compare standard placebo stimulation . Hypotheses : 1 . TENS reduce temporal summation increase nociceptive threshold normal subject 2 . Placebo TENS short burst electrical stimulation consider subject active TENS unit great frequency standard TENS unit produce electrical current 3. effectiveness TENS associate genotype candidate pain gene ( SNPs ) .</brief_summary>
