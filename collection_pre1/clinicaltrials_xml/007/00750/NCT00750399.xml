	<brief_summary>This Phase I clinical trial test safety tolerability intravitreal ranibizumab treatment radiation retinopathy follow plaque brachytherapy patient choroidal melanoma use incidence severity event criterion . The secondary objective ass efficacy intravitreal ranibizumab regression radiation retinopathy ophthalmic examination , fundus photography , fluorescein angiography , optical coherence tomography , well visual acuity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Intravitreal Ranibizumab Radiation Retinopathy Following Plaque Brachytherapy Choroidal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following plaque brachytherapy treatment choroidal melanoma , patient may develop radiation retinopathy . Radiation retinopathy progressive condition lead blindness 50 % case within 5 year treatment . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) protein believe play critical role angiogenesis radiation retinopathy . It one key contributor physiological pathological condition stimulate formation new blood vessel normal vessel incompetence . Ranibizumab recently approve vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor show effective treat exudative macular degeneration . Ranibizumab bind inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) , show cause neovascularization leakage model ocular angiogenesis . This open label , non-randomized active treatment , Phase I trial ass safety tolerability intravitreal ranibizumab ability reduce radiation retinopathy potentially limit vision loss associate disease .</detailed_description>
