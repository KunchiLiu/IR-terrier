	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate efficacy , safety single dose BAY 94-9172 ( ZK 6013443 ) investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) detect cerebral protein-plaque ( amyloid beta ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) . IMP bind amyloidal beta protein accumulate brain tissue already early stage Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . IMP therefore potential tracer use detect amyloid plaque . For subject require visit study centre screen phase , PET image day 1 follow-up visit next day . A telephone call safety follow-up perform 7 day IMP administration . During screen phase subject 's medical , neurological surgical history , specific laboratory test related AD , MRI brain certain neuro-psychiatric test perform . Clinical safety measure ( physical examination , vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) laboratory test ) perform PET image day IMP injection monitor two PET image session . Clinical safety measure perform follow-up visit next day . The result PET image IMP compare probable AD patient healthy volunteer ( HV ) . The clinical diagnosis base international validate accepted criterion establish comprehensive clinical neuro-psychiatric examination</brief_summary>
