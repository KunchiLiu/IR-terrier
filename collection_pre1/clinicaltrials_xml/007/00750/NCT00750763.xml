	<brief_title>Tolerability , Efficacy Mucosal Inflammation Associated With Orally Administered Colon Cleansing Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There several publish trial different colon cleanse agent colonoscopy ( investigation choice visualisation colonic mucosa ) compare different regimen . However , recent publish meta-analysis show audits study underpowered poor study design consensus effective preparation exists1 . 10-20 % fail colonoscopy attributable inadequate bowel cleanse negative impact detection potential malignant lesion colon3 well require patient attend colonoscopy repeat colon cleansing also impact wait list healthcare cost . Colon cleanse preparation broadly classify three group . Osmotic laxative sodium phosphate ( NaP ) increase colon water content attract extracellular fluid efflux bowel wall . Polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) laxatives high molecular weight non-absorbable polymer administer dilute electrolyte solution , retain colon act bowel cleanser without significant fluid exchange across colonic mucosa . The third group stimulant laxatives senna sodium picosulphate work primarily enhance smooth muscle contractility also may increase bowel water content . Previous publish audit study compare different type colon cleansing preparation limit small sample size 5 publish paper 100 patient arm study . These 5 study suggest NaP may better PEG recent meta-analysis fail show , primarily due large number small study show PEG good NaP . Interpretation study limit inconsistent poorly define measure efficacy outcome . Most study use subjective endoscopists assessment overall quality bowel preparation make comparison study impossible . Recently calibrate externally validate outcome assessment tool develop objectively quantify quality bowel preparation4 , randomise publish study yet utilised tool . In absence clear difference efficacy preparation patient tolerability likely important distinguish feature select treatment . Data tolerability outcomes limited evidence PEG solution less well tolerate due volume liquid require drink . This area study need . The ability colonic cleanse preparation clean colon effectively also must balance ability induce change line bowel . Ulceration inflammation colon show occur 3-24 % patient use NaP compare 1-2 % receive PEG . Such finding mistake inflammatory bowel disease Crohns put drug induce change non steroidal anti inflammatory agent ( NSAIDs ) . However , study either non randomised5 underpowered detect real difference . The satisfactory colonic cleanse agent term efficacy , tolerability safety therefore remain unclear . The aim project : 1 . To assess bowel preparation provide best colon cleanse use validate score . 2 . To assess incidence mucosal inflammation/ulceration induce colon cleansing agent . 3 . To see colon cleanse agent best tolerate patient . The information gain audit enable type colonic cleanse preparation tailor subject indication require colonoscopy . For example possible inflammatory bowel disease colon cleanse agent produce least mucosal inflammation would require reduce incidence false positive diagnosis whilst colon cleanse agent tolerable may important elderly . This study prospective blind audit compare three colon cleanse agent , use routinely clinical practice colonoscopy . The three Sodium Phosphate ( Fleet ) , Sodium Picosulphate ( Picolax/Picoprep ) PEG ( Colonlytlye ) . All patient refer undergo colonoscopy would enter study except : 1 . Prior history inflammatory bowel disease suspect inflammatory bowel disease , patient current non steroidal antiinflammatory medication ( exclude low dose aspirin ) . These patient may mucosal inflammation/ulceration would prevent analysis mucosal abnormality due colon cleansing agent would study . 2 . Patients heart failure ( NYHA &gt; 2 ) renal failure ( GFR &lt; 30 ) ( since fluid shift associate sodium phosphate bowel preparation report ) . 3 . All patient age 75 due potential dehydration hyperphosphatemia bowel preparation . Each patient would randomise receive one three colon cleanse agent ( Sodium Phosphate , Sodium Picosulphate PEG ) routinely use clinical practice . The endoscopy administration staff site would responsible random allocation bowel preparation use random number generation resultant bowel preparation collect patient pharmacy , per usual practice , prior colonoscopy . There exclusion criterion bowel preparation selection . On day colonoscopy prior procedure assessment tolerability colon cleansing agent would make use questionnaire . During colonoscopy assessment efficacy colon cleanse agent make blinded colonoscopist use previously validate Ottawa bowel preparation assessment tool .</detailed_description>
