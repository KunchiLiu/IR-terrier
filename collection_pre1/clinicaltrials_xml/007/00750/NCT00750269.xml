	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) medically inoperable patient centrally locate stage I non-small cell lung cancer . ( Phase I ) - To determine efficacy SBRT administer MTD patient . ( Phase I ) - To estimate local control rate SBRT MTD patient . ( Phase II ) Secondary - To estimate rate adverse event ( dose-limiting toxicity ) ≥ grade 3 possibly , probably , definitely related treatment occur within 1 year start SBRT patient . - To estimate rate late adverse event ( i.e. , occur &gt; 1 year start SBRT ) patient . - To estimate local control progression-free overall survival rate patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo stereotactic body radiotherapy every 2 day 1½-2 week ( total 5 fraction ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
