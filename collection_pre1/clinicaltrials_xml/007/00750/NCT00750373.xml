	<brief_title>Early Surgery Versus Conventional Treatment Infective Endocarditis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infective Endocarditis still associate high mortality ( 16-25 % ) high incidence embolic event ( 10-49 % ) , optimal therapeutic strategy remain unclear . The benefit surgery particularly high patient abscess formation , periannular complication , moderate severe heart failure relate acute mitral aortic regurgitation . Retrospective study report valve surgery associate improved survival , benefit early surgery adequately study due inherent treatment bias significant difference baseline characteristic . Embolic indication surgery controversial , surgery usually perform case recurrent emboli persist vegetation despite appropriate antibiotic treatment . The combined risk early surgery valve prosthesis need balance potential benefit prevent embolism improve survival . Risk-benefit balance change recently favor early surgery patient high embolic risk endocarditis follow reason . Identification patient high risk embolism become possible use transesophageal echocardiography . Patients vegetation length &gt; 10 mm transesophageal echocardiography significantly high risk embolization . With advance surgical technique , urgent surgery feasible low operative mortality , success rate valve repair increase . To best knowledge , prospective outcome study compare early surgery conventional treatment strategy base current guideline . The purpose multi-center , prospective , randomized trial compare clinical outcome early surgery versus conventional treatment strategy patient high embolic risk infective endocarditis .</detailed_description>
