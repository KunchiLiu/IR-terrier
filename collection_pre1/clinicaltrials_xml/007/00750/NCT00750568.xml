	<brief_summary>Terbutaline medication use treat serious asthma attack ( status asthmaticus ) . The purpose study determine terbutaline effective safe give continuous intravenous infusion child age 2 year 18 year age . Children participate study inpatient Intensive Care Unit diagnosis status asthmaticus receive terbutaline part routine care . Blood sample physiological assessment use determine body use terbutaline well work .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Background : Asthma remain significant source morbidity mortality child . In United States , 11 million people report asthma attack year 2000 , 5 percent child young age 18 report asthma attack . The trend increase asthma-associated morbidity mortality occur 1980-1995 continued measure . During 1995-1998 , rate emergency department visit asthma increase , rate hospitalization death decrease age group , except child young age 15 . Asthma remain significant problem despite scientific advance generate great understanding mechanism asthma development therapeutic approach reduce morbidity . Status asthmaticus common diagnosis admission pediatric intensive care unit ( PICUs ) . Widely accept treatment status asthmaticus include inhaled beta-2 agonist , systemic corticosteroid , inhale anticholinergic agent . The intravenous and/or subcutaneous administration beta-2 agonist advocate treatment severe asthma prescribed current practice . Additional treatment regimen may include magnesium , theophylline , and/or heliox patient still require mechanical ventilation , anesthetic agent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . Beta-adrenergic receptor agonists critical treatment asthma . Their use frequently result effective bronchodilation . Commonly use beta-adrenergic agonist epinephrine , albuterol terbutaline , albuterol terbutaline increase selectivity beta-2 receptor . These agent give inhaled , IV , subcutaneous oral route . In United States inhale albuterol drug route choice majority circumstance . Regarding efficacy administer medication via inhaled route , one must take account many factor include inhalation technique , inspiratory flow rate , inspiratory volume mode delivery . Several characteristic pathophysiological change occur severe asthma attack ( near complete airway obstruction , low tidal volume , mucus plug ) may preclude delivery inhaled particle area lung affect . In instance , intravenous beta-agonists consider . Because cardiac related side effect pronounce non-selective beta-agonist therapy , beta-2 receptor agonist administer . In United States , terbutaline approve intravenous beta-2 receptor agonist . Terbutaline sympathomimetic amine synthesize mid-1960 's show vitro vivo pharmacologic study animal exert preferential effect beta 2-adrenergic receptor ( beta2-AR ) , locate bronchial smooth muscle . It available clinical use since 1970 's approved FDA use treatment asthma child . Terbutaline bind beta-2 adrenergic receptor result Gs-protein stimulation turn activate adenylyl cyclase increase intracellular level 3'-5 ' cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) . cAMP activate protein kinase A ( PKA ) phosphorylates several protein contribute smooth muscle relaxation resultant bronchodilation . 2 . Hypothesis Primary Objectives : Intravenous terbutaline continuous infusion effective decreasing severity acute asthma attack safe use child 2 year 18 year old . Terbutaline different pharmacokinetics give continuous infusion versus single dose administration . 3 . Study Design : Phase 2 clinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic trial pediatric patient age 2-18 year old receive intravenous terbutaline severe asthma attack . Three group 12 child examine base age total N 36 . The first group 2-6 year , second group 6-12 year old third adolescent 12-18 year old . Treatment efficacy gauge compare score modify pulmonary index ( MPIS ) well utilization rescue medication protocol ( see ) . Pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics determine serum sample collect 1-2 ml aliquot prior infusion 20 minute , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 hour post infusion , clinical improvement necessitates discontinuation infusion le 12 hour . 4 . Study Components : - Modified Pulmonary Index Score ( MPIS ) : Children assess clinical change therapy utilize modify pulmonary index score ( MPIS ) combination 6 physiologic parameter , grade 0-3 , sum reflect pulmonary status . The MPIS assess reproducibility validity show highly reproducible across group health care provider ( nurse , physician , respiratory therapist ) valid indicator asthma severity child . - Terbutaline level determine HPLC designate time state previously .</detailed_description>
