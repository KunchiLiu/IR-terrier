	<brief_summary>The objective study compare safety efficacy ABLC versus oral Posaconazole prevention invasive fungal infection high risk patient hematologic malignancy hematopoietic stem cell transplant . Primary objective demonstrate low toxicity rate low rate invasive fungal infection associate ABLC Posaconazole prophylaxis . Secondary objective compare cost effectiveness two prophylactic regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Posaconazole Three Times Per Day v Weekly High Dose Amphotericin B Lipid Complex ( ABLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : ABLC antifungal drug commonly use treat and/or prevent variety serious invasive fungal infection ( IFIs ) . In study , ABLC use IFI prevention . Posaconazole new antifungal drug commonly use prevent serious IFIs . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) receive either posaconazole ABLC . You equal chance ( 50/50 ) assign either group . You study doctor know group . Study Drug Administration : If assign Posaconazole Group , take posaconazole 3 time day mouth 6 week ( Days 1-42 ) . The study doctor advise take fatty meal and/or nutritional supplement . If assign ABLC Group , receive ABLC week vein 4-6 hour , 6 week ( Day 1 Day 42 ) . If creatinine level increase , dose divide 2 dos per week . The drug may give hospital ( admit hospital study ) outpatient treatment center . Study Visits : Once week Day 1 Day 42 , follow procedure perform : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You ask medication treatment may receive . - You ask IFI symptom may develop . You also ask side effect may occur since last visit . ( You contact study doctor and/or study staff right away , time feel side effect . ) You may certain routine diagnostic test perform time study , necessary confirm IFI . These test may include blood collection ( 1 tablespoon ) , scan , skin tissue biopsy , and/or bronchoscopy . Length Study : You receive study treatment 6 week ( 42 day ) . If develop IFI intolerable side effect , take study early . You may also take study neutrophil ( type white blood cell ) count recover . End-of-Treatment Visit : Your End-of-Treatment visit last day receive study drug ( , 42 day start ) . The following procedure perform . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - If study doctor and/or primary doctor think may IFI , routine diagnostic test may perform . Follow-up Visit : Your follow visit complete 7 - 14 day end-of-treatment visit . The following procedure perform : - You check sign IFI . - If doctor suspect IFI , scan ( x-ray CT scan ) and/or bronchoscopy may perform . - You ask medication treatment may receive , side effect may . - Your vital sign check , physical exam may perform . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - An ECG may perform . This investigational study . ABLC posaconazole FDA approve commercially available treatment prevention IFIs . Posaconazole FDA approve way use study . The study dose study schedule ABLC , however , consider experimental . Currently , dose schedule ABLC use research . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
