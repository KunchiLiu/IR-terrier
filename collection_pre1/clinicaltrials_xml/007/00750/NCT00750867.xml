	<brief_summary>Multiple System Atrophy ( MSA ) progressive sporadic neurodegenerative disorder lead widespread loss brain cell result parkinsonian , cerebellar autonomic dysfunction . The cause MSA remain unclear . Available treatment symptomatic alter course disease . Although cause MSA remain unclear , evidence presence common neuroinflammatory mechanism MSA brain include activation microglia production toxic cytokine . This research protocol base hypothesis MSA progression alter block neuroinflammatory activity . This protocol include administration intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) . IVIg contain antibody derive human plasma block inflammatory response brain lead loss brain cell .</brief_summary>
