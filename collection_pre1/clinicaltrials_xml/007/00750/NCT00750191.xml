	<brief_summary>Each patient assign one two group : IDB Sham . On day procedure , IV insert pre-procedural area patient transport procedure room . The procedure complete fluoroscopy prone position . Patients give 1-4 mg midazolam relaxation procedure , need , 50-100 mcg fentanyl IV procedure . The patient randomly assign treatment placebo use computer-generated code maintain sequentially numbered opaque envelope . The physician performing procedure inform assignment . In IDB group , guide fluoroscopic imaging , two transdiscal probe position posterior annulus use posterolateral , oblique approach . First , two electrically insulate 17G transdiscal introducers use gain access disc space . Than , two radiofrequency probe position introducers bilaterally create bipolar configuration . Placement transdiscal probe within disc annulus confirm use oblique , lateral , anterior-posterior fluoroscopic image . Sham group introducers electrodes position outside disc . This also document use fluoroscopy . Investigator attach electrode inactive heater control device provide similar auditory visual experience patient . Patients therefore remain blinded actual treatment physician performing procedure involve patient 's follow-up . Patients awake communicate physician conduct procedure pain legs present increase procedure , heat protocol would stop . Following completion procedure patient transfer recovery monitor 45 minute , discharge home instruction . The patient follow period 12 month .</brief_summary>
