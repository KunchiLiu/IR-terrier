	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare surgical complication neurosensory disturbance coronectomy conventional excision wisdom teeth root close proximity inferior alveolar nerve . Hypothesis : Coronectomy wisdom tooth reduce chance injury inferior alveolar nerve case radiographic proximity root compare conventional method surgical removal wisdom teeth , difference surgical morbidity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Complications impact wisdom teeth , pericoronitis , caries periodontal disease common , contribute indication third molar surgery still common oral surgical procedure perform . Damages inferior alveolar nerve ( IAN ) surgical removal deeply impacted wisdom teeth well-known complication . Over year , report IAN deficit wisdom teeth surgery record 0.4 % 8.4 % . Injury IAN due compression nerve , either indirect force transmit root elevation directly elevator . It also possible nerve transect cause neurotmesis rotary instrument tooth groove perforated IAN . Several study try correlate radiographic marker relationship IAN root wisdom teeth . Howe Poyton identify 3 radiographical sign root wisdom teeth maybe groove , notch , perforate IAN 2 . Rood Shehab 1990 suggest diversion canal , darken root interruption white line IAN significantly relate IAN injury . Sedaghatfar et al . 2005 perform retrospective cohort study confirm , add narrow root additional significant sign predict proximity nerve root . These radiographic sign indicate surgeon patient increase risk nerve damage associate removal correspond wisdom tooth , prevention tooth remove . Coronectomy procedure intentionally aim remove crown impacted mandibular third molar , leave root undisturbed , thus avoid possible direct indirect damage IAN . This technique first describe Knutsson et al . 1989 retrospective study 33 patient . 6 paper coronectomy publish date , 3 case report 2 retrospective study , one randomize control trial Renton et al . 2005.In last study , 128 patient randomize undergo either extraction coronectomy wisdom teeth . The group undergo extraction find significantly common experience IAN deficit surgery coronectomy group , significant difference could conclude term surgical morbidity . The study also draw similar conclusion . One common finding , however , slow superficial migration wisdom tooth root coronectomy . It suggest root indicate remove expose intraorally , risk IAN damage second surgery reduce root migrate away nerve .</detailed_description>
