	<brief_title>Stereotactic Aspiration Thrombolysis Intracerebral Hemorrhage : Prospective Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The stereotactic compute tomographic-guided aspiration drainage one best choice treatment large-scale deep supratentorial intracerebral hematoma . It use hardware access technology , relatively short time enter hematoma center , suction liquefaction technology . It advantage high clearance rate hematoma , simple convenience , small trauma low-cost . We carry suitable improvement technology 's foundation view deficiency , introduction concept individual , reduce rate bleeding mortality , improve survival , long-term quality life . We adopt scale rate rebleeding , mortality , complication , NIHSS , MRS , BI , GOS scale analysis evaluate efficacy safety technology conservative treatment treatment HICH .</detailed_description>
