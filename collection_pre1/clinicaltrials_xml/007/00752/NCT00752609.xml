	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Peginesatide Injection Maintenance Anemia Chronic Renal Failure Participants Who Are Hemodialysis Do Not Require Dialysis Previously Treated With Darbepoetin Alfa .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia , result primarily insufficient production erythropoietin support erythropoiesis , common consequence chronic renal failure . Both North America Europe establish clinical practice guideline treatment hemoglobin target chronic renal failure/chronic kidney disease patient . These guideline recommend use erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) . The benefit ESA therapy include reduce fatigue , improve quality life , decrease cardiovascular mortality risk improve cardiovascular function . An increased risk death serious cardiovascular thromboembolic event , include myocardial infarction , stroke , congestive heart failure , hemodialysis graft occlusion observe controlled clinical trial ESAs administer target hemoglobin level ≥13.5 g/dL . The vast majority patient receive hemodialysis receive ESA therapy treat anemia patient begin ESA therapy prior requirement dialysis . Anemia chronic renal failure due several factor , primarily inability diseased kidney produce adequate amount endogenous erythropoietin . Ancillary factor also include shorten lifespan red blood cell , iron nutritional deficiency , infection , inflammation . The prevalence anemia increase progressive deterioration renal function , affect 90 % patient chronic renal failure Stage 5 ( End Stage Renal Disease ) . Anemia associate increased mortality , increase likelihood hospitalization , reduce cognitive function exercise capacity , increase leave ventricular hypertrophy heart failure . Treatment anemia reduces morbidity mortality risk may improve quality life . Erythropoiesis stimulate agent establish treatment anemia chronic renal failure participant , improve management anemia alternative transfusion . Peginesatide ( hematide ) parenteral formulation develop correction anemia patient chronic renal failure , bind activates human erythropoietin receptor stimulate erythropoiesis human red cell precursor manner similar know erythropoiesis-stimulating agent . Participants study receive variable dos peginesatide injection every four week . Total commitment time study 30 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient man woman 18 90 year age , inclusive . 2 . The patient CKD meet 1 follow criterion : 1 . Had dialysis ≥6 month prior enrollment , 2 . Had yet begin dialysis ( hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis ) anticipate require initiation dialysis participation study . 3 . The patient stable darbepoetin alfa maintenance therapy ( either SC IV ) continuously minimum 8 week prior enrollment . 4 . The patient 4 consecutive Hb value mean ≥10.0 ≤12.0 g/dL screen period , difference mean first 2 consecutive Hb value mean last 2 consecutive value ≤1.0 g/dL . 1 . The patient know bleed coagulation disorder . 2 . The patient know hematologic disease cause anemia renal disease ( i.e. , pure red cell aplasia , homozygous sicklecell disease , thalassemia , multiplemyeloma , hemolytic anemia , myelodysplastic syndrome ) . 3 . The patient receive recent course intensive iron replacement ( i.e. , 500 mg IV 28 day prior enrollment ) . 4 . The patient advance chronic CKD define New York Heart Association Class III IV . 5 . The patient known history seizure disorder receive antiepileptic medication seizure disorder within 6 month prior enrollment . 6 . The patient schedule kidney transplant . Patients currently transplant wait list exclude , unless identify donor .</criteria>
