	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic Colectomy advance minimally invasive procedure require advanced laparoscopic skill . Minimally invasive surgery offer many advantage patient expose surgeon new challenge , many human factor nature . This turn prolong learn curve delay widespread adoption minimally invasive surgical technique management patient colorectal disease .

	<brief_title>Creating Proficiency-Based Virtual Reality Simulation Training Programme Laparoscopic Assisted Colectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Minimally Invasive Surgery ( MIS ) confer considerable advantage patient 's post operative outcome recovery compare open surgery . Major clinical trial include ; Clinical Outcomes Surgical Therapy Study Group ( COSTSG ) , Colon Cancer Laparoscopic Open Resection ( COLOR ) , Conventional vs. Laparoscopic-Assisted Surgery Colorectal Cancer ( CLASICC ) uniformly consistently show significant reduction post operative pain , use narcotic oral analgesic , length hospital stay , well fast resumption diet , return bowel function use MIS approach . Despite advantage patient , MIS impose significant difficulty surgeon . These difficulty primarily human factor nature . The use Virtual Reality ( VR ) simulation proven help acquisition MIS skill . The use proficiency-based , virtual reality simulation help training MIS provider safe environment complex task repeat many time need achieve pre-set proficiency level . A well design proficiency-based simulation curriculum help widespread use MIS approach . Aims Primary : We aim prove subject randomise train proficiency-based progression simulation curriculum ( SC ) learn perform laparoscopic assist colectomy faster , complete surgical step commit few operative error compare subject randomise current surgical training curriculum ( CC ) Secondary : We aim set institutional national proficiency level Laparoscopic Assisted Colectomy ( LAC ) use ProMIS-LAC simulator Haptica , Ireland . Methods Randomised , control , single blind , multicentre study . Primary Variable 8 centre , 8 co-investigators ( expert consultant laparoscopic colorectal surgeon &gt; 300 MIS procedure ) 16 surgical trainee recruit study . Subjects ( surgical trainee ) randomise ; - Simulator Curriculum ( SC ) group . - Conventional Curriculum ( CC ) group . Subjects randomise CC group continue conventional training programme offer respective hospital . Subjects randomise SC group complete standardise laparoscopic skill train course follow train curriculum include performance simulate LAC procedure nine predetermine step simulator . Subjects must reach predetermined proficiency level complete simulation train course re-joining training programme offer respective hospital . . Upon completion training course , group ' subject population perform total five LAC procedure consecutive patient presence surgeon proctor . Patients indicate LAC procedure screen , consent , enrol patient study . Each procedure record forwarded chief investigator analysis . The number complete surgical step incidence intraoperative error two SC CC group evaluate via blind video review . Secondary Variable All participate co-investigators participate defining proficiency level LAC ProMIS-LAC simulator . The average value record metric obtain expert performance use set proficiency level .</detailed_description>
