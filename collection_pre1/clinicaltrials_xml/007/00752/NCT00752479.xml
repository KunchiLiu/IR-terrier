	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION In organ transplantation immunosuppressive drug dramatically improve life transplant recipient past 30 year , two notable problem remain : drug-associated toxicity , failure drug prevent chronic graft dysfunction extend long-term graft survival . Given circumstance , scientific discussion dominate design effective way induce transplantation tolerance . 'Transplantation tolerance ' describes state donor 'accepted ' without chronic immunosuppressive therapy , remainder immune system leave intact . Thus , lack pathogenic response alloantigen specific , recipient capable respond potentially pathogenic microorganism malignancy . There abundant evidence active immunoregulatory mechanism , may operate maintain transplant tolerance . The problem immunosuppressive drug toxicity could alleviate induction immune tolerance.Over last 25 year , several strategy use successfully induce transplantation tolerance . Each validate least one rodent model , vary degree success upon extension large animal , include nonhuman primate . Very small minority patient , discontinue immunosuppression , provide rare example clinical transplantation tolerance . To purpose , mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) infusion could represent novel tolerogenic cell therapy kidney transplantation . Human bone marrow stem cell , recently refer MSCs , multipotential cell reside within bone marrow differentiate various component marrow microenvironment , addition support growth hematopoietic progenitors.There also evidence MSCs escape immune system , therefore could infuse allogeneic host without reject without requirement conditioning regimen . Moreover , exert immunoregulatory activity , although exact mechanism action unknown . On line , evidence available MSC inhibit na誰ve T cell lock dendritic cell ( DC ) semi-mature state , thereby favor peripheral tolerance . It also point experimental vitro evidence show mouse MSCs inhibit response memory antigen-specific T cell cognate peptide . We expect , kidney transplant recipient , MSC infusion would allow inhibition alloantigen-specific memory T cell response contribute long-term graft survival . Moreover vitro study document CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell population increase significantly MLR human MSCs present compare control without MSCs . These finding suggest MSC may modulate T cell response even regulatory mechanism . Furthermore immunosuppressive effect MSCs vivo show baboon model , infusion ex-vivo expand match donor third-party MSCs delay time rejection histoincompatible skin graft . The immunomodulatory function MSCs also document preliminary vivo study human , cell infusion exert preventive effect development acute chronic GVHD . Thus , although data far available human kidney transplantation , expect peri-transplant intravenous infusion syngeneic ex-vivo expanded MSCs peripheral T-cell depletion/blockade basiliximab low dose RATG ( induction therapy ) cover low dose maintenance immunosuppressive drug would allow safety achieve graft tolerance living-related kidney transplant recipient . This could inhibition na誰ve memory T cell , promotion development activation regulatory T cell , eventually lead indefinite graft survival . Up clinical study MSC infusion immunomodulatory effect patient undergo kidney transplant . Nevertheless , clinical data effectiveness safety MSC infusion diseases/conditions . The general aim present study test cell therapy syngeneic ex vivo expand MSC strategy induce tolerance living-related kidney transplant recipient . MSC prepare accordingly establish protocol , start bone marrow explants living-related recipient obtain 3-4 month kidney transplant . From sample , MSC expand vitro use present study patient undergo kidney transplantation . AIMS AND STUDY DESIGN This pilot , explorative study define safety biological/mechanistic effect systemic intravenous infusion syngeneic ex-vivo expanded MSCs living-related kidney transplant recipient ( one two HLA haplotype mismatch ) basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy maintenance immunosuppressive drug ultimate objective test feasibility safely achieve graft tolerance subsequent efficacy pilot study . Indeed , complement research clinical portion document operational tolerance , pilot efficacy study safely achieve kidney graft tolerance complete withdrawal maintenance immunosuppressive therapy follow pending fact result biological/mechanistic test document MSC infusion allow development immune microenvironment permissive graft tolerance . Specific objective To compare change immunophenotype ex-vivo T-cell functional test sample peripheral blood measurement urine messenger RNA FoxP3 , kidney transplant recipient give syngeneic ( recipient ) MSC infusion basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy maintenance immunosuppressive treatment low-dose cyclosporine ( CsA ) plus low-dose mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) . In particular , different time 12 month post transplant , plan follow : Immunophenotyping 1 . To assess effect treatment absolute percent count circulate CD4+ , CD8+ T cell ( CD4/CD8 ratio ) , B cell NK cell . 2 . To examine whether change circulate na誰ve memory T cell count may occur ( CD45RA/CD45RO ) . 3 . To characterize emergence circulation T cell subpopulation immunoregulatory phenotype ( CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ ; CD8+CD28- , CD3-CD56bright ) . Lymphocyte functional assay 1 . To detect whether donor-specific hyporesponsiveness develop post-operatively monitoring T cell activation response alloantigen stimulation mixed lymphocyte reaction ( MLR ) , ELISPOT assay IFN-gamma cell-mediated lympholysis ( CML ) . 2 . To determine whether T cell deletion/anergy develop repeat T cell stimulation MLR IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay presence high dose IL-2 . 3 . To monitor regulatory property T cell circulate peripheral blood vitro proliferative assay , particular CD4+CD25high , CD8+CD28- T cell , CD56bright NK cell . Urinary FOXP3 messenger RNA ) To evaluate whether measurement urinary cell mRNA level FoxP3 , functional factor regulatory T lymphocyte , may provide insight immunologic event within renal allograft . In addition safety profile MSC infusion investigate . Should biological/mechanistic ex vivo study document MSC infusion allow development immune microenvironment permissive graft tolerance , pilot efficacy study achieve operational tolerance complete withdrawal maintenance immunosuppressive therapy follow . The criterion document development pro-tolerogenic microenvironment ( 12 month post-kidney transplant ) following : - Percentage inhibition memory T cell response ( IFN-gamma ELISPOT ) and/or na誰ve T cell response ( MLR ) versus donor antigens high 15-20 % patient receive peri-transplant MSC infusion compare patient receive immunosuppressive therapy alone , context normal immune response versus third party antigen , mitogen ( PHA ) recall antigen ( mumps , pertussis ) . - Induction donor-reactive T cell anergy percentage high 15-20 % patient receive peri-transplant MSC infusion compare give immunosuppressive therapy alone ( evaluated addition high dose IL-2 ELISPOT assay ) - Appearance peripheral blood regulatory T cell percentage high 80 % patient receive peri-transplant MSC infusion compare patient receive immunosuppressive therapy alone reversal inhibition donor-specific immune response ( evaluate depletion specific regulatory cell ELISPOT and/or MLR assay ) percentage high 50 % MSC-treated compare non MSC-treated patient . We plan start safety biological/mechanistic study 6 living-related kidney transplant recipient . Three patient receive ex-vivo expand syngeneic MSC infusion time kidney transplant , 3 additional patient cell ( control ) , cover induction therapy basiliximab low-dose RATG , maintenance immunosuppression low-dose CsA MMF . Randomization MSC cell infusion perform time recipient sign inform consent participate study . This patient fulfill criterion enter wait list kidney transplant live donor . The first patient receive single i.v infusion syngeneic MSC ( 2x106 MSCs per kilogram body weight ) . If procedure safe major adverse event related i.v cell infusion occur within first month ( early peri-infusion side effect , severe infection possibly due over-immunosuppression ) , second patient enrol . Should procedure safe also case , third kidney transplant patient enrol undergo syngeneic MSC infusion . To complement research clinical portion document operational tolerance , pilot efficacy study safely achieve kidney graft tolerance complete withdrawal maintenance immunosuppressive therapy follow pending fact result biological/mechanistic test ( 12 month post-transplant ) document MSC infusion allow development immune microenvironment permissive graft tolerance , high inhibition donor specific memory T cell and/or high generation alloantigen-specific regulatory T cell drug immunosuppressive treatment alone . In additional pilot explorative efficacy study consecutive patient include follow first episode rejection ( ) occur 29 consecutive patient successfully withdraw immunosuppressive therapy . This estimate accord Simon 's two-stage minimax design .</detailed_description>
