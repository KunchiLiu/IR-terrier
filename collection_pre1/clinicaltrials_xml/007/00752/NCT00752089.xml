	<brief_title>Experimental Dentifrice Remineralization/Fluoride Uptake Situ Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topical fluoride proven clinically effective prevention dental caries . It generally agree anti-caries effect fluoride ( F ) mainly decrease rate enamel demineralization enhance rate enamel remineralization . An in-situ Surface Micro-hardness ( SMH ) test widely use evaluate enamel demineralization remineralization caries process . Determination fluoride uptake in-situ also provide good estimation true fluoride bioavailability fluoride dentifrice product . In study , in-situ remineralization fluoride uptake model use compare efficacy experimental dentifrice market dentifrice placebo dentifrice . Participants wear partial denture contain two partially demineralize enamel specimens two weeks- 24 hour per day , except brush ( twice daily ) test dentifrice . Following treatment period , enamel specimen analyze SMH recovery fluoride uptake microdrill enamel biopsy technique .</detailed_description>
