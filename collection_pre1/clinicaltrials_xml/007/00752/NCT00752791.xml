	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Peginesatide Injection Maintenance Treatment Anemia Peritoneal Dialysis Participants Previously Treated With Epoetin .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According International Federation Renal Registries , 1999 prevalence peritoneal dialysis United States approximately 9.5 % patient receive dialysis ( 2005 United States Renal Data Systems data indicate prevalence around 7.5 % ) . Data Europe 1999 2000 ( include United Kingdom , France Germany ) indicate peritoneal dialysis mode dialysis approximately 11.1 % dialysis patient . 2006 data United Kingdom indicate 20 % patient dialysis receive peritoneal dialysis French German data indicate rate 8.1 % 4.8 % respectively . More 90 % patient chronic renal failure/chronic kidney disease Stage 5 ( End Stage Renal Disease ) anemic . The vast majority patient receive hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy treat anemia . Anemia chronic renal failure due several factor , primarily inability diseased kidney produce adequate amount endogenous erythropoietin . Ancillary factor also include shorten lifespan red blood cell , iron nutritional deficiency , infection , inflammation . The prevalence anemia increase progressive deterioration renal function , affect 90 % patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) Stage 5 ( End Stage Renal Disease ) . Anemia associate increased mortality , increase likelihood hospitalization , reduce cognitive function exercise capacity , increase leave ventricular hypertrophy heart failure . Treatment anemia reduces morbidity mortality risk may improve quality life . Erythropoiesis stimulate agent establish treatment anemia chronic renal failure participant , improve management anemia alternative transfusion . Peginesatide ( hematide ) parenteral formulation develop correction anemia patient chronic renal failure , bind activates human erythropoietin receptor stimulate erythropoiesis human red cell precursor manner similar know erythropoiesis-stimulating agent . Participants study receive variable dos peginesatide injection every four week . Total commitment time study 29 week .</detailed_description>
