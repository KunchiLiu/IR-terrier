	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Repeat Treatment With PurToxÂ® Botulinum Toxin Type A Frown Lines Between Eyebrows</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose randomize withdrawal Phase III , multi-center research study evaluate safety effectiveness repeat treatment intramuscular dose Mentor Purified Toxin reduction glabellar rhytides ( frown line ) . Approximately 700 subject enrol approximately 12 clinical site U.S.A . Effectiveness determine degree frown line reduction , maximum force frown rest ( neutral expression ) : - assess live study doctor , - assess live subject , ; - assess independent reviewer base subject photograph Frown line grade level severity base scale : Severity - Minimal ( 0 ) - Mild ( 1 ) - Moderate ( 2 ) - Severe ( 3 ) There two part study . In first part , study participant receive treatment intramuscular injection 30 Units Mentor Purified Toxin two separate occasion ( Cycles 1 2 ) 6 month apart . In second part study ( Cycle 3 ) , subject randomly assign receive either intramuscular injection 30 Units Mentor Purified Toxin placebo ( preservative-free saline ) subject followed 1 month ( 3:1 , PurTox : placebo ) . Each subject receive five intramuscular injection total 0.5 mL study drug glabellar area , treatment visit . Participation take place maximum 14 month , include Part 1 ( Cycle 1 2 ) Part 2 ( Cycle 3 ) . The number clinic visit vary person person depend upon subject 's response study drug , range approximately 9 19 clinic visit . There also 4 telephone follow-up contact .</detailed_description>
