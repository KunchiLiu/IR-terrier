	<brief_summary>We hypothesize exercise-induced bronchospasm ( EIB ) NCAA Division I collegiate level diagnose , poorly control asthma result exercise-related symptom population may diagnose , erroneously attribute EIB . This project test individual self-identified exercise induce bronchospasm asthma , well gender-matched control sport , eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation ass presence EIB asthma . By make correct diagnosis , improve health outcome may achieve athletic performance may enhance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnosis Exercise-induced Bronchospasm ( EIB ) Asthma National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan identify Division I athlete , male female , University Arizona currently treat either EIB asthma review preparticipation physical form identify medical staff . In addition , athletes prescribed inhaler Campus Health Services identify review electronic pharmacy record . Each athlete identify match two control athlete ( ie , currently use asthma medication ) sport . Subjects test EIB use eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation , gold standard make diagnosis . Subject Recruitment Potential subject identify describe . Subjects approach one co-investigators , study explain opportunity review consent form ask question provide . Subjects consent schedule test . Questionnaire Subjects , enrol , ask complete 27 item questionnaire include question prior history treatment asthma , well history respiratory symptom . In addition , subject ask complete Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) . EVH Spirometric Testing All subject undergo baseline assessment lung function use KoKo Legend Portable Spirometer . The subject undergo eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation test . EVH test require subject hyperventilate dry air contain 5 % carbon dioxide room temperature six minute target ventilation 30 time subject 's forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) . The EVH test consider positive fall FEV1 10 % baseline record 6 minute period hyperpnea . To overcome problem post-test respiratory muscle fatigue , FEV1 record least three minute challenge repeat three-minute interval 21 minute . Spirometry carry accord American Thoracic Society standard . Both absolute percent-predicted spirometric value record . Predicted value calculate validate , publish , race-specific regression equation . ( Hankinson , et al . Spirometric reference value value sample general US population . Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1999 ; 159:179-187 . ) Asian-American athlete evaluate use norm white . To provide optimal test circumstance , medication withhold 8 96 hour bronchial provocation test : short-acting bronchodilator , sodium cromoglycate , nedocromil sodium , ipratropium bromide 8 hour ; long-acting bronchodilator antihistamines 48 hour ; leukotriene antagonist four day . Steroids inhale day test . No caffeine take morning test . Vigorous exercise avoid least four hour prior start test well exercise day test . Subjects schedule test allow least 6-8 hour elapse previous vigorous activity test . Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( eNO ) Measurement Measurement eNO obtain prior measurement pre-EVH spirometry . Exhaled NO measured employing technique modify Silkoff et al ( 1997 ) follow American Thoracic Society guideline eNO assessment ( American Thoracic Society , 1999 ) . In brief , technique utilizes resistive device provide constant low expiratory flow rate ensures vellum closure . The combination vellum closure low flow rate , specifically 50 ml/s , assure accurate measurement specific pulmonary derive eNO , exclude potential contamination nasal paranasal sinuses NO ( large source eNO ) . Nitric oxide concentration measure use rapid-response chemiluminescent analyzer ( NIOXâ„¢ System , Aerocrine , Sweden ) , response time &lt; 700 ms 10-90 % full scale . The Food Drug Administration approve device clinical application asthma management . The measurement circuit consist mouthpiece-filter connect resistor/flow meter collection bag . The participant inhale total lung capacity ( TLC ) , insert mouthpiece , immediately exhale slowly . During expiration , participant attempt maintain target flow 50 ml/sec . The target period exhalation time 10 second . However , participant able perform 10 second exhalation , time requirement may decrease 6 second . Dietary history recall 4-6 hour prior test obtain screen dietary source NO . Data Collection Spirometric value quality control measure EVH test record form specifically design purpose , spirometry , already use Pediatric Pulmonary Function Laboratory . Data enter computer spreadsheet double-checked second person assure accuracy . It transfer statistical package ( STATA ) subsequent analysis . Data Analysis For observational study summative descriptive statistic carry . If opportunity comparative analysis identify , parametric nonparametric analysis carry appropriate . A fall occur early post-EVH period , especially conjunction document pre-exercise elevation eNO , take suggestive poorly control asthma , fall 9-12 minute EVH , especially absence elevated eNO , interpreted indicative true EIB .</detailed_description>
