	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high safe dose combination TAS-106 carboplatin give patient advanced cancer cancer spread . Objectives : Primary Objectives : To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination TAS-106 carboplatin administer intravenous infusion every 3 week . To perform Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis TAS-106 carboplatin Secondary objective : To assess antitumor activity TAS-106 combine carboplatin To investigate relationship select biomarkers efficacy safety outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study TAS-106 Combo With Carboplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : TAS-106 carboplatin design interfere growth cancer cell stop cell division , may cause cell die . Study Drug Dose Level : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level study drug combination base join study . Up 6 dose level study drug combination test . Three ( 3 ) participant enrol dose level . If intolerable side effect occur first group 3 people , next 3 people enrol study receive dose carboplatin high dose TAS-106 . If second group intolerable side effect , next 3 people receive high dose carboplatin receive dose TAS-106 second group . This continue high safe dose combination find . Study Drug Administration : A `` cycle '' study 3 week long . On Day 1 cycle , receive carboplatin vein 60 minute , follow TAS-106 vein 24 hour . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle ( +/- 1 day ) , come clinic follow procedure perform : - You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You neurological exam . - You ask drug take recently side effect may experience . The study doctor may give drug lessen possible side effect . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . On Day 1 Weeks 2 3 cycle ( +/- 3 day ) , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If blood cell count ( white blood cell , red blood cell , and/or platelet ) drop low level , may need routine test repeat often week . At end every 2 cycle ( +/- 1 week ) , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or x-rays check status disease . You must stay Houston area Cycle 1 . During time , blood test study test procedure must do MD Anderson . Starting Cycle 2 , prefer , may blood test Weeks 2 3 cycle perform medical laboratory close home . If need additional blood cell count test perform well , blood test also do close home . All study test procedure must do M. D. Anderson . Length Study Participation : You may continue stay study drug long benefit . If cancer get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study . If experience side effect severe intolerable , however , doctor may decide necessary delay next dose study drug combination and/or low dose . End-of-Study Visit : When go study reason , end-of-study visit test perform study visit . You also ECG . This investigational study . Carboplatin FDA approve commercially available us . TAS-106 FDA approve commercially available . The combination carboplatin TAS-106 FDA approve commercially available . At time , combination use research . Up 55 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
