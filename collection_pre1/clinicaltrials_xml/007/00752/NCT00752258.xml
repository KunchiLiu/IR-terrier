	<detailed_description>This Phase III , multi-center , open-label study evaluate long-term safety repeat treatment PurTox treatment glabellar rhytides . Up 576 patient enrol 12 site U.S.A. patient may participate Mentor Purified Toxin Phase I , II IIIa study . Safety tolerability repeat treatment Mentor Purified Toxin examine study . Effectiveness determine degree frown line reduction , maximum force frown rest ( neutral expression ) : - assess live study doctor , - assess live subject , ; - assess independent reviewer base subject photograph Frown line grade level severity base scale : Severity - Minimal ( 0 ) - Mild ( 1 ) - Moderate ( 2 ) - Severe ( 3 ) All subject meeting study eligibility criterion treat 30 U Mentor Purified Toxin .
