	<brief_title>A Placebo-Controlled Study Saracatinib ( AZD0530 ) Patients With Recurrent Osteosarcoma Localized Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Further detail provide SARC ( Sarcoma Alliance Research Collaboration ) : After complete surgical removal cancer , patient randomly assign receive either Saracatinib placebo ( sugar pill ) throughout study . Patients take Saracatinib ( placebo ) daily mouth total 364 day . The duration treatment divide 13 cycle , 28 day cycle break . Patients see interim medical history , physical exam laboratory study prior cycle . To monitor recurrence tumor , patient undergo thoracic CT scan 3-4 week , 6-8 week , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month , every 6 month 2 year , every year 5 year start treatment . An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) take 3 month , bone scan perform 12 month . Patients recur lung on-study thought amenable complete surgical resection able find receive placebo saracatinib . Those patient receive placebo may option undergo surgical resection . If fully resect recurrent disease , give option receive oral therapy saracatinib . Saracatinib administer daily , oral dose 175 mg , 28-day cycle , breaks cycle . The duration treatment saracatinib thirteen 28-day cycle ( 364 day total ) . If complete resection lung nodule achieve , patient remove study . Patients recur location lung on-study take study time . Blood tumor sample research purpose collect time tumor remove . After complete 13 cycle , patient follow approximately every 3 month 2 year start treatment , approximately every 6 month 4 year start treatment , year 5 .</detailed_description>
