	<brief_summary>This open-label , interventional study subset participant randomize one two treatment-optimization strategy . Participants moderate severe Crohn 's disease ( CD ) receive induction treatment comprise 3 infusion infliximab Weeks 0 , 2 , 6 . The participant evaluate Week 10 . Participants clinical response enter observational phase study receive standard care treatment , per infliximab product monograph . Participants lose response , may qualify entry interventional phase study , randomize one follow treatment-optimization arm : 1 ) dose increase : infliximab 7 mg/kg , every 8 week 2 ) shorten interval : infliximab 5 mg/kg every 6 week . Note : Due early study termination , statistical analysis perform interventional part study , therefore , endpoint dedicate phase study analyze .</brief_summary>
