	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) common primary liver malignancy , annual incidence 500,000 new patient half new case occur China . The common etiological cause HCC hepatitis B hepatitis C viral infection . HCC cancer high particular relevance Hong Kong high prevalence ( 10 % ) hepatitis B virus infection population . It second common cancer cause death Hong Kong . Surgical resection liver transplantation regard main curative treatment HCC . Nevertheless , majority patient unresectable HCCs advance tumor stage poor liver function . Besides , transplantation indicate early small HCCs , application limit shortage liver graft , particularly severe problem Hong Kong . HCC aggressive , largely chemo-resistant cancer poor prognosis , currently effective systemic chemotherapy HCC . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) overexpressed HCC think contribute tumor development . Oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy biologic agent show effective safe treatment advance HCC patient . Sorafenib , oral multi-kinase inhibitor , block tumor cell proliferation target multiple growth factor pathway also exert anti-angiogenic effect . Sorafenib approve FDA use renal cell carcinoma base prolonged survival phase III trial . Single agent Sorafenib show efficacy patient advance HCC primary result prolong overall survival achieve recent randomized phase III trial . However , patient would disease stabilization phase II trial show tumor response rate 8 % ( PR &amp; MR ) . Combination chemotherapy may improve tumor response rate .</detailed_description>
