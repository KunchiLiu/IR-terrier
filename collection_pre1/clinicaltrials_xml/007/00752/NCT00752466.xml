	<brief_title>A Drug Interaction Study Pharmacokinetics Topiramate FLUNARIZINE When Given Together Separately</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize open-label study conduct 2 group subject . Group 1 consist migraine patient recruit multiple site Group 2 include healthy subject single study center . In Group 1 total 36 subject enrol target 24 subject complete study . In Group 2 , total 28 healthy subject enrol least 24 complete trial . Group 1 include patient treatment migraine prophylaxis dose flunarizine least 4 week prior 6-week run-in phase . Once select , patient enter 6-week run-in phase receive 5mg flunarizine every evening . Following run-in phase , patient continue flunarizine randomize 2 subgroup equal size ; Subgroup 1a consist patient treat topiramate flunarizine Subgroup 1b , control group , patient receive flunarizine treatment . Patients Group 1 ( Subgroups 1a 1b ) commence initial confinement ( Day 1 ) complete 6-week run-in phase . All patient must history migraine accord IHS1 criterion least 1 year prior study entry . For Groups 1 2 dropout replaced ensure require number patients/subjects sex complete study . Safety assess study incidence severity treatment-emergent adverse event abnormal finding safety evaluation . Changes clinical laboratory test vital sign result Baseline End Study early termination evaluate . In Group 1 : 5 mg flunarizine every 24 hour ( 8:00 p.m. ) , begin Day -42 6 week , Day -1 . Patients continue receive dose Days 1 81 . Group 1a : On Day 4 Topiramate dose titrate 25 mg BID 75 mg ( 25 mg 50 mg pm ) Day 19 50 mg BID Day 26 - Day 81 . Group 1b continue Flunarizine . Group 2 : Topiramate begin Day 2 titration 25 mg BID 50 mg BID Day 5 18 . 5mg Flunarizine daily start Day 12- Day 18 .</detailed_description>
