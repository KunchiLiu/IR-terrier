	<brief_title>The Effects Bariatric Surgery Weight Loss Knee Pain Patients With Osteoarthritis Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee one five leading cause disability among elderly men women1 . According American Academy Orthopedic Surgeons , estimate 19 million visit make year physician 's office due knee-related problem , total cost OA estimate $ 60 billion 2004.2 Obesity primary risk factor development OA among several feature age , gender , trauma , infection , heredity , high impact sport .

In study examine effect weight loss bariatric surgery Knee pain patient clinical criterion indicative osteoarthritis . Our main objective determine weight loss bariatric surgery contribute relief knee pain increase function patient osteoarthritis . The study look obese patient co-morbidity knee osteoarthritis . An interview administer appropriate , potential candidate ask series question take pain section Western Ontario McMaster Universities Index Osteoarthritis ( WOMAC ) . Patients WOMAC pain score â‰¥ 3 ask series X-rays take knee . Those individual display radiographic evidence knee OA ask participate study twenty five position fill . At next pre-bariatric surgery visit , study participant basic knee exam perform Kevin P. Black , M.D . order evaluate structural integrity alignment knee joint . The information gather exam serve baseline measure knee function study . Prior undergoing surgery , 25 patient ask complete full version WOMAC survey separate , related survey Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) . These survey re-administered 6 , 12 , 24 month post-surgery order ass change knee pain function .</detailed_description>
