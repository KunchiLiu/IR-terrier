	<brief_summary>Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) high mortality rate general population , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) accounting approximately 50 % death . Vascular calcification common finding patient CKD . Furthermore , patient CKD develop secondary hyperparathyroidism , partly decrease calcitriol synthesis kidney . Treatment secondary hyperparathyroidism include use activate vitamin D include calcitriol paricalcitol . Recent evidence dialysis patient suggest improve survival patient use paricalcitol compare calcitriol . Studies uremic rat suggest differential effect calcitriol paricalcitol expression marker soft-tissue calcification independent calcium-phosphorus product . Calcitriol increase calcification vascular smooth muscle cell culture calcification medium . There also significant increase pulse pressure animal treat calcitriol . The investigator hypothesize different form vitamin D may differential effect vascular calcification progression CKD patient .</brief_summary>
