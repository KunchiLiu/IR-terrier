	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Trial Assess Moxifloxacin Treating Community-Acquired Pneumonia ( CAP ) With Aspiration Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>186 patient 4 center enrol study . Patients accord criterion CAP aspiration factor enrol randomized one follow group . The treatment duration range 2 4 week . Study Group : Intravenous treatment moxifloxacin 400mg i.v . OD . Based investigator 's decision , switch make moxifloxacin 400 mg OD , orally ( Moxifloxacin injection use 3 week consecutively ) . Control Group : Intravenous treatment levofloxacin 400mg i.v . OD plus metronidazole 0.5g i.v . bid . Based investigator 's decision , switch make levofloxacin 400mg OD plus metronidazole 0.2g tid , orally . Treatment continue complete resolution radiological , clinical laboratory alteration regression observe . Clinical , bacteriological , laboratory radiological examination perform pre-treatment . Swallowing/coughing reflection test use aspiration factor diagnosis . Risk factor ( Decreased level consciousness , dysphagia , gastroesophageal reflux , neurologic disease , mechanical device-related ( e.g . nasogastric feed tube ) impairment upper aerodigestive tract , vomit , bronchial obstruction due neoplasm foreign body , bronchiectasis , pulmonary infarction , etc ) evaluate treatment . Clinical laboratory examination blood routine ( include Hb , differential blood count , etc ) , urine routine , biochemistry examination ( include serum bilirubin , hepatic/renal function parameter , etc ) , coagulation examination repeat selectively . Radiological examination ( e.g . chest x-ray ) repeat visit clinical monitor one week treatment . At test-of-cure visit ( 7-14 day end therapy ) comprehensive clinical , bacteriological laboratory examination perform .</detailed_description>
