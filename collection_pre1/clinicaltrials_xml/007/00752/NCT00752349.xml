	<brief_summary>Ultrasound widely apply many field medicine less commonly use evaluation tongue movement swallow abnormality . Fuhrman RAW report usefulness use ultrasound evaluate poor tongue coordination [ 1 ] . Peng CL state ultrasound could provide excellent quantitative qualitative base tongue movement swallow use cushion-scan technique [ 2 ] . Videofluoroscopic swallow study ( VFSS ) widely accept gold standard evaluate swallow abnormality able evaluate whole swallowing procedure without interference pharyngeal contraction foreign body sensation swallow examine use fiber-optic laryngoscope . One important information VFSS provide detection subclinical silent aspiration . The decision management many patient swallow abnormality usually base VFSS finding [ 3 ] . As show many report , experience show VFSS provide extremely important information understand pathophysiologic change dysphagia due variable etiology , patient nasopharyngeal cancer suffer radiation therapy [ 4 ] patient stroke [ 5 ] . Using finding VFSS , physicians medical staff make important decision whether oral feed give , safety swallow maneuver work appropriate choice food consistency safe dysphagic patient . The difficulty VFSS usually transportation paraplegic hemiplegic patient ward examine chair . The frequency examination duration VFSS usually limit avoid unnecessary radiation exposure . Hence , ultrasound provide role evaluate oral condition benefit convenience transportation availability well radiation exposure . Therefore , validation value ultrasound oral swallow correlation VFSS important test clinical feasibility . Peng CL et al report experience use real-time ultrasound evaluation intrinsic tongue movement [ 2 , 6 , 7 ] . The finding submental ultrasound quite different finding VFSS provide surface information tongue swallow radiopaque barium sulfate bolus . Combined real-time B mode M mode ultrasound , report potential digital data analysis oral phase swallow . Kuhl V et al report usefulness ultrasound evaluation laryngeal elevation patient dysphagia [ 8 ] . They find significant decrease laryngeal elevation patient diagnose neurogenic dysphasia [ 8 ] . Casas et al successfully combine ultrasound examination plethysmography evaluate swallow condition child cerebral palsy [ 9 ] . The result study explain potential ultrasound oral swallow dynamic laryngeal movement . Our experience VFSS show usefulness VFSS diagnose management patient swallow problem dysphagia [ 4 , 5 , 10 , 11 ] . To knowledge , little experience compare ultrasound VFSS patient swallow problem . Therefore , conduct study correlate submental ultrasound VFSS finding try find clinical feasibility usefulness . Purposes : This study evaluate usefulness submental ultrasound ( SM US ) oral phase swallow correlation videofluoroscopic study ( VFSS ) . 1 . To compare normal volunteer patient swallow abnormality submental ultrasound . 2 . To evaluate compare patient swallow problem use submental ultrasound VFSS . Type study : Retrospective . Time study : Jan 2004 - July 2006 .</brief_summary>
