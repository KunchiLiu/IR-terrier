	<brief_summary>All chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPDs ) block air flow lung , two common form , emphysema chronic bronchitis , common cause respiratory failure . Previous research show COPD patient know disease manage , improve quality life reduce need urgent care . However , traditional method teach COPD patient disease self-management skill expensive require intensive work . A new , less expensive way reach large group people information need help patient stay healthier happy treatment . This study create computer program help people learn disease manage . This study determine whether computer program , call Home Automated Telemanagement ( HAT ) , help patient COPD manage disease follow treatment plan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) result damage lung , make hard someone COPD breathe . The two common form COPD emphysema chronic bronchitis , cause respiratory failure irreversible damage lung . There cure COPD , intervention help patient understand disease manage improve patient quality life prevent crisis would require urgent care . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute World Health Organization 's Global Health Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) recommend multiple component maintain care patient COPD , include regular patient assessment , education concern COPD , effective communication patient health care provider , patient compliance treatment plan , implementation behavioral change model increase health , social support patient caregiver . Evidence suggest guideline use widely , possibly labor intensive expensive require frequent visit medical facility . Because effective intervention use patient previous study show telecommunication technology successful patient self-care , study develop home automate telemanagement ( HAT ) system incorporate many GOLD guideline use patient ' home . HAT Internet-based system provide ongoing education patient COPD , help patient follow self-care plan , help health care provider monitor patient ' self-management daily access . The system consist three piece : ( 1 ) patient unit include computer palmtop Internet accessible device equip disease-specific testing device , ( 2 ) HAT server analyze store self-testing result , ( 3 ) clinician unit review patient result Internet . By incorporate text , audio , visual component , system provide advice self-care plan tailor patient notify health care providers patient 's plan compliance . This study two phase . In first , HAT system COPD refine base user interviews focus group . In second , researcher test effectiveness keep people COPD healthy ensure follow self-care plan . During second phase study , last 18 month , participant provide Internet-capable computer . All participant continue see doctor follow regular treatment plan prescribe doctor . Some randomly assign also receive HAT system . Those give HAT system take 1-hour training course use expect use daily 10- 15-minute self-assessment disease diary entry . The HAT system also assessment , counseling , education tool participant use . Participants assess seven time , four assessment research site three home participant . Assessments conduct every 3 month , research site schedule baseline Months 6 , 12 , 18 . Participants complete questionnaire interview assessment measure severity disease , well-being , attitudes toward disease . During assessment research site , additional test breathe physical fitness perform .</detailed_description>
