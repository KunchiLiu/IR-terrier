	<brief_summary>The first part study observational part . In eligible patient early stage respiratory cancer , primary secondary endpoint evaluate scheduled radical cancer therapy . The measured variable , include blood sample , pulmonary function test , level dyspnea , exercise test , measurement body composition , respiratory peripheral muscle force , health relate quality life psychological status . Only register participant complete radical treatment either less 70 % predict normal value quadriceps force ( QF ) decrease 10 % predict value QF pre-and post radical treatment , allow participate second part study . These patient randomize three group . Group A , control group , usual care follow accord clinical symptom . Group B offer conventional resistance training program ( CRT ) , group C , offer whole body vibration resistance training ( WBV ) FITVIBE-platform . All previous variable measure 6 12 week training .</brief_summary>
