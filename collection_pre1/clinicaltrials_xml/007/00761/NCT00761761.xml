	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : To evaluate Sensoril® treatment person bipolar illness improve cognitive performance improve residual mood/anxiety symptom impair metabolic index . RESEARCH PLAN : We conduct randomize , placebo control , add treatment trial Sensoril® ( add ongoing prescribed pharmacological mood stabilizer ) period 8 week . Measures cognition , psychopathology laboratory index utilized evaluate primary secondary outcome , along safety assessment . METHODS : Up Seventy-six subject DSM IV bipolar I disorder recruited Western Psychiatric Institute Clinic . Using 1:1 randomization , subject sign informed consent document randomize receive Sensoril® placebo . It expect 16 76 subject may meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , leave 60 consent adult ( 18 65 year ) DSM IV-TR Bipolar Disorder assess euthymia ( Young Mania Rating Scale Score less equal 10 , Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale Score less equal 10 ) period 4 week receive stable dos current mood stabilizer . They also assess cognitive dysfunction ( attention/executive function , immediate declarative memory , psychomotor performance ) use Cogtest - proprietary neuropsychological battery test . These subject characterize normal pre-morbid IQ , ECT treatment past 6 month , alcohol substance dependence past 6 month , mini-mental state score 23 . Sensoril® ( placebo ) administer use random assignment dose 250mg/day , increase dose 500mg/day second week . The dose 500mg ( 250mg tolerability issue ) continue fora total 8 week . Sensoril® known interaction psychotropic drug , mood-stabilizer level monitor begin end study . The principal investigator work New Jersey base company ( Natreon , Inc. ) obtain IND FDA Sensoril® treatment cognitive dysfunction person Bipolar disorder ( IND # 102616 ) . Standard psychopathology rating scale administer evaluate impact residual symptom bipolar disorder . Laboratory index ( glucose/lipids ) evaluate baseline end study . Safety assess comprehensive health assessment , include medical history , evaluation laboratory measure . Any adverse effect assess ask question visit , necessary , follow via telephone contact bring subject assessment outside scheduled visit . SIGNIFICANCE : Cognitive dysfunction seriously hinder improved functional outcome person bipolar disorder . If short term intervention Sensoril® show promise , definitive study use adequate power sample size , long duration conduct . If improvement cognitive problem link improved functional outcome use supplemental treatment , important therapeutic milestone bipolar disorder achieve .</detailed_description>
