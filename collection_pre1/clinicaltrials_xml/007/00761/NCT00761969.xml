	<detailed_description>The observational study Prevention Ischemic Events Patients Peripheral Arterial Disease European Guidelines Cardiovascular Disease Prevention ( Slovenian acronym study : PID-PAB ) aim test efficacy European Guidelines Cardiovascular Disease Prevention patient peripheral arterial disease , even high mortality rate patient isolate coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease leave natural course disease . The PID-PAB study compare rate survival , major atherothrombotic event ( myocardial infarction , stroke , critical limb ischemia ) revascularization procedure group patient stable peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) control group age- sex-matched subject without PAD . Both group receive up-to-date medical care ( include life-style advice prescription cardioprotective medication ) accord cardiovascular risk base European Guidelines Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Clinical Practice . PAB define reduce ankle-brachial pressure index = &lt; 0.90 , absence PAD define palpable pedal pulse normal ankle-brachial index ( 0.91-1.30 ) . Exclusion criterion : age &lt; 40 &gt; 80 year inclusion , active cancer disease life expectancy les 5 year , major atherothrombotic event 30 day prior enrollment , pregnancy . All subject follow annually 5 year comprehensive medical examination . The setting study primary care facility Slovenia , European Union . The target size group 1000 subject , i.e. , 5000 patient year . The number participate physicians-researchers estimate 100 , goal physician recruit 10 patient PAD 10 age- sex-matched control . The study coordinate steer committee consist researcher Department Vascular Diseases University Ljubljana Medical Centre , Institute Biomedical Informatics University Ljubljana School Medicine , Department Family Medicine University Ljubljana School Medicine pharmaceutical company Krka , Slovenia , also sponsor study . The protocol study approve Committee Medical Ethics Republic Slovenia . The PID PAB study aim answer question : 1 . Is stable PAD still adverse prognostic indicator spite contemporary preventive measure ? 2 . To extent contemporary preventive measure improve prognosis patient PAD comparison historic control ( describe early report natural history PAD ? We expect still find significant difference rate cardiovascular event patient PAD peer without PAD , hypothesize contemporary preventive measure strongly attenuate adverse prognosis PAD regard survival major atherothrombotic event comparison natural history disease .</detailed_description>
