	<brief_title>The Effect Remote Preconditioning Exercise Performance Elite Swimmers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose study determine possible precondition competitive swimmer improve exercise performance provide insight physiological mechanism precondition may function . With four 5 minute inflation cycle blood-pressure cuff , induce skeletal muscle ischemia know powerful method preconditioning . Each swimmer blind expected effect randomly assign real precondition versus sham intervention consist four 5 minute cycle blood pressure cuff inflation 10mmHg . During subsequent training session , subject receive intervention receive previous test session . Therefore , subject part study group serve control . To evaluate exercise performance , subject perform incremental swim test protocol base method develop reported member research team . Swimming velocity , blood lactate level , heart rate , breathe frequency , dyspnoea oxygen saturation measure incremental exercise . Finally , would like determine precondition effect regular exercise training animal model . Exercise performance think limited skeletal , cardiac respiratory muscle fatigue associate episode exercise induce arterial hypoxemia . Preconditioning defined period brief lack oxygen ischemia tissue protect heart organ another sustained episode ischemia . Preconditioning believe improve exercise performance protect skeletal , cardiac respiratory muscle decrease oxygen by-product anaerobic metabolism may limit individual 's exercise performance . Elite athlete , highly trained swimmer , may provide research team opportunity evaluate effect precondition local tissue hypoxia anaerobic metabolic by-product healthy adolescent , otherwise possible . With study , show possible precondition competitive swimmer improve exercise performance use ischemia limb precondition stimulus .</detailed_description>
