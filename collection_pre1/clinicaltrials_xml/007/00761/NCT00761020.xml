	<brief_title>Merozoite Surface Protein 1 Antibody Response Asymptomatic Human Malaria Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , two group volunteer expose malaria bite infect mosquito . In one group , volunteer give several dos drug call mefloquine , know prevent development malaria symptom . The group treat drug could prevent symptoms infection . After exposure , group monitor period approximately 6 month see develop symptom malaria . Any subject treat appropriate medication . Subjects group blood check regularly period presence certain malaria antibody call Merozoite Surface Protein 1 , Anti-MSP-1 short , use special blood test ( also know assay ) . At completion study , result assay analyze determine test use diagnose malaria infection person without symptom .</detailed_description>
