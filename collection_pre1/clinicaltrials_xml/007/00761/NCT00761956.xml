	<brief_summary>The purpose study test significant difference functional outcome , specifically pre-operative ROM post-operative ROM obtain use NexGen CR versus NexGen CR-Flex knee implant . Specifically , predict increase post-operative range motion experience patient treated NexGen CR-Flex knee implant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare NexGen CR CR-Flex Knee Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compare clinical result NexGen CR femoral component high flexion potential NexGen CR-Flex femoral component patient degenerative joint disease require total knee arthroplasty . The primary variable interest post-operative range motion achieve two device , implant slightly different surgical technique patient may also subject different rehabilitation program depend device assign .</detailed_description>
