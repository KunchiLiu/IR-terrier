	<brief_summary>People pancreatic cancer usually large amount cancer area pancreas around diagnose . Or cancer spread ( metastasize ) outside area abdomen able surgically remove ( resect ) . For patient metastatic disease , one standard treatment combination gemcitabine erlotinib . This combination show slightly longer survival compare get gemcitabine alone . For patient localize unresectable disease , standard treatment remain controversial . Early study show chemotherapy radiation together well either one use alone . The great benefit external beam radiotherapy may period full-dose chemotherapy alone , help rapid spread . A problem begin treatment standard radiotherapy dos chemotherapy usually reduce sometimes half . Studies already show low dose radiotherapy ( LDRT ) safe . This study evaluate safety LDRT instead standard dos full dose gemcitabine erlotinib patient locally advance limited metastatic pancreatic cancer . Patients enrol group 3 6 slightly high dose LDRT erlotinib . For patient locally advanced disease , protocol also may help patient develop die spread liver abdominal cavity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Low-Dose Fractionated Radiotherapy Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer nearly universally fatal , approximately 38,000 new case 34,000 death expect 2008.1 The majority patient present disease amenable curative resection . For patient metastatic disease , one standard treatment combination gemcitabine small molecule epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib . This combination result modest survival benefit compare single agent gemcitabine.2 For patient present localize unresectable disease , standard treatment remain controversial . Early study demonstrate chemotherapy radiation superior either modality alone.3 However , recent study systemic therapy alone typically include small real minority patient locally advanced disease , support systemic therapy alone reasonable treatment option.2 Adding confusion recent European report systemic therapy alone may superior combined modality therapy , least used initially.4 The great benefit external beam radiotherapy may period full-dose chemotherapy alone , ensure rapid metastasis develop.5 A limitation begin treatment conventional external beam radiotherapy requirement reduce dose gemcitabine 40-50 % . Given safety preclinical rationale LDRT , propose phase I study evaluate safety LDRT standard dose gemcitabine erlotinib patient locally advance limited metastatic pancreatic cancer . Patients enrol cohort escalate dos low dose radiotherapy . Radiation port uniform patient describe Section 5.6 . As LDRT administer site disease liver abdominal cavity iliac crest , patient metastatic disease confine area eligible . For patient locally advanced disease , protocol also high rationale , overwhelming majority patient develop succumb recurrence liver abdominal cavity,10 area would cover proposed radiation field . The dose 2880 cGy limit kidney upper abdominal organ potential toxicity .</detailed_description>
