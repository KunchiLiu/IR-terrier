	<brief_summary>Each year , hip fracture , injury impair independence quality life , occur 280,000 Americans 36,000 Canadians . The annual healthcare cost associated injury expect soon reach $ 9.8 billion United States $ 650 million Canada . It important place optimal practice guideline surgical handle injury . One type hip fracture , call femoral neck fracture , often treated surgical procedure call internal fixation . When perform internal fixation , orthopaedic surgeon favor use multiple small diameter screw use single large diameter screw slide plate . However , use slide hip screw might fact result few complication surgery reduce need second surgery , call revision surgery . This study compare two different surgical procedure determine one result well outcomes surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Alternative Implants Surgical Treatment Hip Fractures ( The FAITH Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One type hip fracture , call femoral neck fracture , involve break narrow part femur bone head femur join main shaft . The break either undisplaced , involve little separation fracture site , displace , substantial separation . Surgeons agree best surgical procedure undisplaced fracture internal fixation , mechanical implant reconnects two separate segment bone . For displaced fracture , surgeon usually choose internal fixation hip joint replacement . There one way perform internal fixation . The majority orthopaedic surgeon currently favor use multiple small diameter cancellous screw . However , alternative method use single large diameter screw attached sideplate , call slide hip screw , gain popularity might reduce post-surgical complication need revision surgery . Which surgical method best patient unknown . This study compare use multiple small diameter cancellous screw versus single slide hip screw rate revision surgery 2 year patient sustain femoral neck fracture undergo internal fixation . The study also compare impact two different surgical procedure overall health , function , quality life patient . Results study may impact current orthopaedic practice . Participation study last 2 year . Before surgery , participant complete baseline assessment include x-ray , medical history review , physical examination . Participants randomly assign undergo one two type internal fixation surgery repair hip fracture . In one group participant , surgeon use least two small cancellous thread screw diameter least 6.5 mm . In group participant , surgeon use single large diameter screw partially thread . This screw , call slide hip screw , affixed femur bone sideplate , fixation . All surgeon , need meet certain criterion partake study , follow manufacturer ' technique guideline use either type screw . Specific aspects pre-operative post-operative care , use antibiotic calcium supplementation , standardized participant . Follow-up assessment complete either phone in-person hospital clinic . They occur 1 , 2 , 10 week surgery 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month surgery . All assessment include questionnaire interview health status , hip function , pain , revision surgery . Some in-person assessment also include x-ray .</detailed_description>
