	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Provant Therapy System Subjects With Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) , approximately 20.8 million people US diabetes 7 % population ( 1 ) . A significant number diabetic population prone pedal ulceration estimate reveal 15-20 % population develop foot ulcer lifetime . Treatment diabetic foot ulceration pose problem healthcare provider many year . The literature describe many different modality direct wound treatment strategy . Most treatment rely timely application biological dressing , offload wound , regular ( often inconvenient ) visit doctor , important , compliance patient . It uncommon wound present great six month , despite use debridement , off-loading basic wound care technique , present advanced therapy . Provant select study : - It already indicate adjunctive palliative treatment postoperative pain edema superficial soft tissue . - It non-invasive wound treatment system utilizes proprietary PRFE signal hypothesize trigger release endogenous growth factor induce mitosis accelerate cell cycle , use Ca+2 mediate pathway . The result significant increase rate cell replication . - It also show PRFE trigger genetic sequence cascade 'wound repair ' gene critical four stage wound healing : inflammation , granulation , epithelialization , remodel . - It utilized VA Health System since 2004 serious adverse event attributable device . This study assess endpoint : - Primary - incidence wound reach complete closure , - Secondary - time complete wound closure percentage reduction wound area , percentage reduction wound volume , rate healing mm2/day mm3/day .</detailed_description>
