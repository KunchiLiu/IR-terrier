	<brief_title>Intrapleural Catheter Daily Versus Three Times Week Drainage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An IPC silicone ( rubberlike ) tube insert chest cavity drain excess fluid chest . At MD Anderson , patient tell drain IPC every day . At institution , patient tell drain IPC less often . Before IPC Placement : Before IPC insert , follow test procedure perform help doctor decide need IPC insert : - You perform 6 minute walk test learn check breathe ability fatigue level . To perform walk test , ask walk far possible around cone flat indoor course 40 yard long . You walk pace take breaks time necessary . - After sign consent , fill 2 questionnaire ask question feel symptom may . These questionnaire take 20-30 minute complete . IPC placement : You IPC place drain fluid chest cavity . You give separate consent sign procedure doctor give detailed instruction regard procedure . Study Groups : A chest x-ray perform right IPC placement . You randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group , chest x-ray following day return clinic follow . Group 1 IPC drain every day , Group 2 IPC drain 3 time week ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday ) . You give detailed instruction drain catheter . Follow-Up Visits : Two ( 2 ) week receive IPC , return clinic follow-up visit doctor check IPC possible leaking , infection , see much pleural fluid drain . After follow-up visit 2 week , come clinic every 4 week IPC remove . During follow-up visit follow test procedure perform see condition change : - You chest x-ray see amount pleural fluid decrease see lung re-expanded . - You perform 6 minute walk test . - You complete 2 questionnaire . - The IPC drain . After IPC remove , 3 6 month , follow-up visit M. D. Anderson local doctor 's office . At visit chest x-rays see pleural fluid come back . The study personnel contact phone , email mail periodically study 3 month 6 month IPC remove check status . The phone call , email , mail follow-up take 5-10 minute complete . You ask question concern may want discus doctor . You also ask chest x-ray since study . If x-ray , ask share result study doctor . This investigational study . Up 250 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients symptomatic pleural effusion require placement IPC . 2 . Signed informed consent prior study related procedure . 3 . Subject must age 18 year . 1 . Any following intervention affect hemithorax : prior IPC , prior chest tube placement , history chemical mechanical pleurodesis , history thoracotomy within 4 week incompletely heal surgical incision randomization . 2 . Evidence empyema history empyema affect hemithorax 3 . Noncorrectable bleed diathesis 4 . Any psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule . 5 . Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease concurrent condition Principal Investigator 's opinion make undesirable patient participate trial would jeopardize compliance protocol . 6 . Participation clinical trial prevents randomization subject either strategy . 7 . Clinical evidence skin infection potential site IPC placement . 8 . Current prior IPC placement , intervention manage recurrent malignant pleural effusion contralateral hemithorax ( exclude thoracentesis ) .</criteria>
