	<brief_summary>Incisional hernia frequently see long term complication surgery cause much morbidity even mortality patient . Despite study optimal closing technique laparotomy , risk incisional hernia midline incision remain 5-20 % . Major risk factor incisional hernia laparotomy , like obesity , steroid use , malnutrition , smoke connective tissue disorder , know . Despite knowledge , yet develop sufficient method prevention . One specific group high risk patient patient abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) . The relationship aortic aneurysm abdominal wall hernia , like inguinal hernia , report . Retrospective prospective study show average risk incisional hernia AAA repair 31.6 % . Another high risk group group obese patient . Patients BMI 27 high risk develop incisional hernia midline incision incidence 22 % 12 month . Considering 50 % incisional hernia clinically evident first 12 month , total incidence 30 % . This high risk group patient obesitas aneurysmatic disease benefit prevention . Some small study perform evaluate usefulness safety primary laparotomy wound closure aid prosthetic mesh . These study show low risk incisional hernia low infection rate , even use contaminate wound colostomal surgery . However , perform adequate randomized control trial study prevention incisional hernia . Our hypothesis incisional hernia prevention use prosthetic mesh laparotomy effective patient aortic aneurysm obese patient BMI 27 .</brief_summary>
