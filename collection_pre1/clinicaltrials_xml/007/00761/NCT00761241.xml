	<brief_summary>This study conduct find effect ( good bad ) combination treatment chemotherapy , radiation therapy surgery pancreatic cancer . The chemotherapy drug use : Gemcitabine , Docetaxel , Oxaliplatin , 5-FU alpha-interferon . The goal decrease size tumor , removal surgery perform . Current treatment stage pancreas cancer offer less ideal result , little opportunity treatment curative intent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer : Gemcitabine/Docetaxel Oxaliplatin Based Chemo/RT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects must biopsy proven adenocarcinoma pancreas bidimensionally measurable CT. Cancer must consider locally advanced ( able treat surgically ) . Subjects must receive prior treatment pancreatic cancer . Subjects must receive prior radiation therapy abdomen pelvis ( reason ) . Subjects receive immunosuppressive therapy ( e.g . prednisone , methotrexate ) . Eligible subject receive initial chemotherapy regimen include eight cycle Gemcitabine Docetaxel . All subject re-evaluated surgery - tumor shrunk enough , subject undergo surgery , follow additional chemotherapy Oxaliplatin , 5FU Alpha-interferon radiation therapy ; subject recover side effect chemo/radiation therapy , receive final chemotherapy regimen four cycle Gemcitabine docetaxel . Subjects surgical candidate eight cycle chemotherapy undergo additional four cycle Gemcitabine docetaxel follow reassessment surgery . If surgical candidate , undergo surgery follow chemo/radiation therapy regimen . If surgical candidate , undergo chemo/radiation therapy regimen . Subjects may remove study treatment follow reason : - The investigator feel subject benefit treatment - The subject chooses discontinue reason - The subject experience side effect consider unacceptable - The subject increase size tumor</detailed_description>
