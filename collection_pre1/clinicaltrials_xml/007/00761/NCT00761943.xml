	<detailed_description>Disease Prevalence : Orthopaedic surgeon frequently ask evaluate patient stiff painful shoulder . Among common cause clinical condition adhesive capsulitis ( frozen shoulder ) , think affect approximately 2-5 % general population . The incidence patient diabetes much high , 29 % study . Clinical Summary Adhesive Capsulitis : Adhesive Capsulitis may summarize briefly clinical syndrome shoulder pain progressive loss motion eventual improvement symptom . The cause classify either primary ( idiopathic ) secondary , due know precipitating condition . Risk factor associate develop adhesive capsulitis include diabetes , female sex , middle old age , thyroid disease . Secondary cause adhesive capsulitis include trauma , shoulder surgery , degenerative arthritis , rotator cuff tear , prolonged immobilization . The condition characterize functionally loss active passive range motion anatomically thickening contracture joint capsule . The term `` Adhesive Capsulitis '' coin Neviaser note contracted capsule peel humeral head like `` adhesive plaster skin '' . A broad term `` Frozen Shoulder '' use Codman 1934 describe related condition . There commonly accept progression three clinical phase : painful freezing , stiff/frozen phase , eventually thaw slow return motion . Many patient residual loss motion several year . For people diabetes , residual , permanent loss motion much 50 % . The natural history disease show dismal thought . Pathology Disease : Histopathologic change occur joint capsule synovial lining cellular change chronic inflammation , fibrosis , perivascular infiltration subsynovial layer increase vascularity . There debate whether disease primarily inflammatory fibrotic nature support , depend stage disease . Some show arthroscopy reveals highly vascular , red , inflamed synovium . Neviaser define four stage arthroscopic adhesive capsulitis range acute synovitis chronic adhesion . The pathology clearly understood make optimal treatment difficult determine . Limitations Current Imaging Studies : Imaging modality commonly use evaluate shoulder x-ray ( rule arthritic change fracture ) unremarkable primary adhesive capsulitis . Traditional arthrogram contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging may show decreased capsular volume edema invasive expensive test . Magnetic Resonance Arthrogram show thicken coracohumeral ligament joint capsule area rotator interval . Although MRI demonstrate edema inflammatory change , cost seem prohibitive follow clinical disease serial basis , perhaps monthly disease progress . Ultrasound much likely candidate serial examination . Successful Use Ultrasound Rheumatoid Wrist Studies : Recent report literature show color doppler ultrasound ( CDUS ) promise tool estimation synovial inflammatory activity rheumatoid arthritis . Researchers use specific quantitative criterion measure resistivity index small blood vessel synovium color pixel fraction . Both measure attempt quantify vascularity surrogate indicator inflammation joint capsule . In subsequent study inject wrist corticosteroid obtain ultrasound image one month later show change resistivity index color pixel fraction correlate improved clinical evaluation functional improvement . Ultrasound Adhesive Capsulitis : Ultrasound study shoulder many benefit MRI/MRA include : contraindication risk patient , non-invasive , relatively low cos. Ultrasound comparable MRI study synovium much less downside . Despite theoretical advantage ; limited study literature report color doppler ultrasound evaluate adhesive capsulitis shoulder . In one study , researcher correlate ultrasound finding arthroscopic finding conclude ultrasound provide early , accurate diagnosis adhesive capsulitis . Their criterion , however , qualitative use echotexture increase doppler flow indicate increase vascularity . No quantitative measurement make . Clinical Importance Proposed Study : Although objective treat patient adhesive capsulitis clear ( restore full , pain-free motion unrestricted shoulder function ) optimal treatment remain unclear . This due part clear consensus diagnosis , poor understand pathology , difficulty compare effectiveness treatment regimen . As many poorly define medical condition , multiple , different empiric treatment employ vary success . If could clearly identify diagnostic criterion reproducibly stage disease could reliably scientifically compare treatment approach thus provide real benefit many patient common condition . Our propose study important step process .</detailed_description>
