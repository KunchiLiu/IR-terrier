	<brief_title>The Value Platelet-Rich Plasma Chronic Midportion Achilles Tendinopathy : Double-blind Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction- Overuse injury Achilles tendon common entity athlete older athlete increase risk . When exact origin tendon pain unclear , term tendinopathy prefer . Most accepted treatment moment eccentric exercise programme , accord Dutch guideline . However , recent systematic review effectiveness eccentric exercise treat low extremity tendinoses conclude unclear whether eccentric exercise effective form treatment . Recent study describe new treatment strategy tendinopathies , use platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) . Platelets participate actively tissue repair process stimulate release several growth factor . Recently , find platelet-rich plasma clot releasate stimulates cell proliferation , collagen deposition , enhance gene expression matrix degrade enzymes endogenous growth factor human tendon cell vitro . The published clinical cohort study tendon research report 93 % reduction pain PRP-treated patient chronic elbow tendinosis . Also short term follow-up , PRP injection beneficial injection anaesthetic agent . Aim- To monitor potential clinical improvement chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy injection PRP evaluate recovery process time use new Ultrasonographic method ( Ultrasonographic Tissue Characterisation ) . Hypothesis : The average VISA-A score higher patient group treat eccentric exercise therapy combination PRP injection comparison group treat saline injection combination eccentric exercise . Study population- In total , 54 patient symptomatic Achilles tendinopathy include study . Study design- The study double-blind randomise single-centre clinical trial compare 2 treatment group . The researcher , sport medicine physician patient blind received therapy . Therapy- All patient perform heavy load eccentric exercise programme , consist 180 repetition daily . The patient randomise 2 treatment group : ultrasound guide intratendinous saline injection eccentric exercise ultrasound guide intratendinous PRP injection eccentric exercise . Follow-up- Follow-up ( clinically ultrasonographically ) 6 , 12 , 24 52 week . At 24 week , researcher unblinded analysis preliminary data . The patient remain blinded therapy 52 week follow-up . At 52 week follow-up second , blind researcher evaluate patient use primary secondary outcome measurement . Outcome measurements- Primary outcome measurement : VISA-A score , validate instrument detect severity symptom patient Achilles tendinopathy . As secondary outcome measurement subjective patient satisfaction return sport rat . For evaluation tendon repair , Ultrasonographic Tissue Characterization ( UTC ) Power Doppler ultrasound ( PDU ) perform . UTC previously develop horse tendon provide quantitative information tendon fiber alignment relate ultra-structural integrity tendon tissue non-invasive approach .</detailed_description>
