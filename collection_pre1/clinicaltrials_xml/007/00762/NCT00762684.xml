	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study TAK-559 Treating Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin primary regulator blood glucose concentration . A subnormal response circulate insulin level target tissue lead decrease insulin-mediated glucose uptake . Insulin resistance associate normal high insulin level often accompany dyslipidemia , disruption lipid metabolism result increased triglyceride low-density lipoprotein level well decrease high-density lipoprotein level patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . In early stage insulin resistance , compensatory mechanism increase insulin secretion pancreas maintain normal near-normal glucose level . Once pancreas fails maintain increased insulin output , overt type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs . TAK-559 novel oxyiminoalkanoic acid investigation use oral agent treatment patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . TAK-559 partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist activity , potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activity , modest peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activity high concentration nonclinical model . This study design evaluate safety glycemic control TAK-559 patient type 2 diabetes mellitus whose symptom manage diet exercise .</detailed_description>

Was take stable dose least 10 mg glyburide least 10 day prior Screening B . Had stable worsen selfmonitoring blood glucose level take glyburide . Had lowdensity lipoprotein less 160 mg/dL ( 4.1 mmol/L ) Screening A . Had body mass index less equal 45 kg/m2 Screening A . Was willing counsel investigator designee follow individualize , weightmaintaining diet study period . Had evidence insulin secretory capacity demonstrate Cpeptide concentration great equal 1.5 ng/mL ( 0.50 nmol/L ) Screening A , necessary , repeat Screening B . Was able perform daily selfmonitoring blood glucose test throughout study . Had normal thyroidstimulating hormone level le 5.5 uIU/mL ( 5.5 mIU/L ) great equal 0.35 uIU/mL ( 0.35 mIU/L ) Screening A . Was good health determine physician ( ie , via medical history physical examination ) , diagnosis type 2 diabetes mellitus . Had fast clinical laboratory evaluation within normal reference range test laboratory , , result must deem clinically significant investigator prior Randomization . Females post menopausal , surgically sterile , use adequate contraception . Had diagnose type 1 diabetes mellitus , hemochromatosis , history ketoacidosis . Had condition know invalidate glycosylated hemoglobin result ( eg , hemolytic state , hemoglobinopathy ) . Was require take intend continue take disallowed medication , prescription medication , herbal treatment overthe counter medication may interfere evaluation study medication , include : Insulin Oral antidiabetic TAK559 ( include sulfonylurea glyburide , alphaglucosidase inhibitor , metformin ) Systemic corticosteroid Warfarin Rifampin St. John 's Wort . Thiazolidinediones Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor agonist Nicotinic Acid Fibrates Had history myocardial infarction , coronary angioplasty bypass graft , unstable angina pectoris , transient ischemic attack , clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram , document cerebrovascular accident within 6 month prior Screening A . Had abdominal , thoracic , vascular surgery within 6 month prior Screening A investigator 's opinion would warrant exclusion study . Had creatine phosphokinase value great 3 time upper limit normal Screening A . The creatine phosphokinase value retested prior Randomization elevate . Had persistent unexplained microscopic macroscopic hematuria history bladder cancer . Had triglyceride level great 500 mg/dL ( 5.6 mmol/L ) Screening A . Had alteration allow lipid lower medication ( dose drug ) within 2 month Randomization , applicable . Had donate and/or receive blood blood product within 3 month prior Randomization . Had history drug abuse ( define illicit drug use ) history alcohol abuse ( define regular daily consumption 4 alcoholic drink per day ) within 2 year prior Randomization . Had systolic BP great 140 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure great 95 mm Hg Screening B .
