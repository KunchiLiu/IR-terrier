	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy TAK-559 Combination With Metformin Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin primary regulator blood glucose concentration . A subnormal response circulate insulin level target tissue lead decrease insulin-mediated glucose uptake . Insulin resistance associate normal high insulin level often accompany dyslipidemia , disruption lipid metabolism result increased triglyceride low-density lipoprotein level well decrease high-density lipoprotein level patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . In early stage insulin resistance , compensatory mechanism increase insulin secretion pancreas maintain normal near-normal glucose level . Once pancreas fails maintain increased insulin output , overt type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs . Insulin also play important role metabolism fat protein exerts influence peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor level . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor -alpha receptor express predominantly skeletal muscle , adipose tissue , heart , liver , kidney , gut , macrophage , vascular tissue , play key role energy storage , glucose homeostasis , vascular biology . Thus , insulin activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha receptor , result cellular uptake glucose . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor receptor ligand-activated transcription element regulate gene expression necessary metabolism . For reason , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor play pivotal role glucose homeostasis , adipocyte differentiation , lipid storage . The gene predominantly target transcription activity activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha receptor mediate fatty acid uptake , fatty acid oxidation , lipoprotein metabolism . As , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist great effect lipid metabolism vascular biology . TAK-559 novel oxyiminoalkanoic acid investigation use oral agent treatment patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . TAK-559 partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist activity , potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activity , modest peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activity high concentration nonclinical model . This study design evaluate safety glycemic control TAK-559 patient type 2 diabetes mellitus take metformin monotherapy oral anti-diabetic insufficient .</detailed_description>
