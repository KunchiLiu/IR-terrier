	<detailed_description>Diabetes chronic disease multiple metabolic defect result hyperglycemia arise inadequate insulin activity . Type 2 diabetes genetic predisposition , lifestyle , body constitution age play important role determine time onset severity . Type 2 diabetes usually result progression reduce sensitivity hepatic peripheral-tissue cell circulate insulin ( i.e. , insulin resistance ) progressive inability body produce adequate insulin overcome insulin resistance ( i.e. , insulin deficiency due beta cell insufficiency ) result impaired glucose tolerance ultimately overt diabetes . In United States , estimate 15.7 million people diabetes , type 2 diabetes occur approximately 90-95 % case . Therapeutic agent develop address major functional metabolic defect associate type 2 diabetes : decrease beta-cell function , elevate hepatic glucose output , insulin resistance . The oral therapeutic agent use treatment type 2 diabetes separate follow four category base mechanisms action : insulin secretagogues , inhibitor hepatic glucose output , inhibitor complex carbohydrate breakdown intestine insulin sensitizer . Thiazolidinediones reduce insulin resistance enhance insulin sensitivity muscle cell , adipose tissue , hepatic cell ( inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis ) direct impact insulin secretion . Thus thiazolidinediones improve glycemic control result reduce level circulate insulin . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor find tissue important insulin action , adipose tissue , skeletal muscle , liver . The great concentration peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor -gamma receptor adipose tissue . Pioglitazone HCl ( ACTOSÂ® ) thiazolidinedione develop Takeda Chemical Industries , Ltd. Research suggest Angiotensin II receptor blocker involve endothelial cardiovascular function , insulin sensitization obesity . TAK-536 ( azilsartan ) angiotensin II receptor antagonist affinity selective antagonistic activity angiotensin II type 1 receptor . This study design evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability pioglitazone combination azilsartan subject type 2 diabetes . Study participation anticipate approximately 6 month .</detailed_description>
