	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) fatal degenerative disease brain cure . AD cause brain cell die . AD think cause excess beta amyloid ( β-amyloid ) , sticky protein brain form amyloid plaque . At autopsy , AD patient require amyloid plaque brain order definitive diagnosis AD . Inhibiting enzyme gamma-secretase ( γ-secretase ) lower production β-amyloid . Semagacestat ( LY450139 ) functional γ-secretase inhibitor show low β-amyloid blood spinal fluid human test thus far blood , spinal fluid brain animal test thus far . This study use several different test measure effect semagacestat β-amyloid amyloid plaque patient . The buildup amyloid plaque measure brain scan take picture amyloid plaque brain . Other test measure overall function brain brain size patient . In trial , patient initially receive placebo ( inactive sugar pill ) , certain point study , switch active drug , semagacestat . In word , patient could eventually receive active drug . Each patient 's participation could last approximately 2 year . Patients take approved AD medication permit participate study continue take medication study . All patient complete study option continue receive semagacestat participate open label study . Preliminary result study ( LFBC ) ( another similar study LFAN [ NCT00594568 ] ) show semagacestat slow disease progression associate worsen clinical measure cognition ability perform activity daily live . Study drug stop study . LFBC , LFAN open label LFBF ( NCT01035138 ) amend continue collect safety data , include cognitive score , least seven month . The CT-Registry reflect result analyse original protocol addition amend protocol .</brief_summary>
