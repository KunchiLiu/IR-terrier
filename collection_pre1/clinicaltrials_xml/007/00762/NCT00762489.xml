	<brief_summary>Body temperature measurement one standard vital sign measurement newborn baby order ass health status . Temperatures take regular basis throughout newborn 's stay well-baby floor . A temperature elevate normal range age depress normal range age may sign illness newborn . There many method may use record temperature . Traditionally , axillary ( arm ) rectal ( rectum ) sit use . Recently , new method temperature measurement become available . Temporal artery thermometer non-invasive method measure baby 's temperature mean light shone forehead read baby 's temperature quickly . It clear whether method accurate newborn period . The purpose study evaluate accuracy temporal artery temperature measurement . This achieve observe axillary measurement , rectal temperature measurement , temporal artery temperature measurement take approximately time infant . These measurement compare determine temporal artery thermometry reliable measurement rectal / axillary temperature measurement . We plan compare Hypothesis : Temporal artery thermometry immediate newborn infant accurate measurement temperature age group .</brief_summary>
