	<detailed_description>The link psychiatric symptom underlie biological process remain unclear time . Unipolar Major Depressive Disorder , Bipolar Disorder , Schizophrenia associate major disruption function quality life . Understanding causal physiological genetic factor involve disorder would allow u make great stride tailor treatment individual 's need . Because etiology disorder likely multifactorial nature , study examine wide range variable might best allow u examine interaction different factor get good sense gene brain interact produce psychiatric disorder .</detailed_description>
