	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine two protein blood increase acute heart failure . These two protein produce heart become dysfunctional unable contract normally . They may release blood detect standard method research laboratory . Thus , purpose study determine relation change two protein blood occurrence acute heart failure . At time , detection increase proteins blood know associated disease heart failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Circulating Markers That Underlie Transition From Compensated Hypertrophy Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) complex clinical syndrome major public health problem claim life &gt; 500,000 per year . It lead Diagnosis Related Group ( DRG ) hospital discharge US . There approximately 1-3 million admission annually acute decompensated heart failure . The mortality rate Classes III IV heart failure 14-18 % year ( 1 ) . At present , nearly 5 million patient HF U.S. ( 2 ) . Early detection prevention remain key measure treat subject form heart disease . Discovering define circulate marker underlie transition compensate hypertrophy acute heart failure represent area important need detection prevention effort . The exist marker BNP useful help differentiate heart failure condition . However , large variation abnormal BNP level carry diagnosis heart failure make BNP level unreliable predictor transition compensate decompensated heart failure . Apoptosis contributes , perhaps , cause myocyte death underlies progression heart dysfunction transition stable compensated heart failure acute deterioration ( 3 ) . Apoptosis regulate biological process result cell death ( 4-9 ) . Caspases , family cysteine acid protease regulate process , fact , lead apoptosis . Apoptotic trigger signal result activation proximal initiator caspase ( caspase-8 , -9 , 10 ) . These initiator caspase cleave turn activate downstream effector caspases caspases-3 , -6 -7 . These effector caspase cleave various protein present cytoskeleton nucleus like lamin A , alpha-fodrin poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase , lead apoptosis . Caspase-3 key executioner apoptotic pathway , responsible totally critically proteolytic cleavage cellular nuclear protein . Activation caspase-3 require proteolytic process inactive zymogen active p17 p12 fragment . The cleaved caspase-3 detected antibody specific cleave enzyme ( p17 fragment ) cell lysates immunoblotting ELISA assay utilize spectrophotometric determination microplate reader OD450 nm . The primary goal pilot study determine whether 1 ) activate caspase-3 detected human circulation diurnal rhythm variation serial change level time , 2 ) whether level increase acute decompensated heart failure , 3 ) whether transition acute stable heart failure correlate decrease level . Another potential marker acute deterioration dystrophin . Dystrophin originally identify X-linked gene whose mutation N-terminus cause cardiomyopathy . Dystrophin provide important structural support cardiac myocyte sarcolemmal membrane ( 10-11 ) . It link actin N-terminus dystrophin-associated protein complex sarcolemma C-terminus extracellular matrix muscle . Mutations cause loss support sarcolemmal instability myopathy . Myocardial dystrophin translocation cleavage associate progression heart failure contractile dysfunction . These change reverse follow reduction mechanical stress ventricular assistance device ( 12 ) . In present pilot study , test hypothesis dystrophin release detected human circulation acute deterioration heart failure . We test whether 1 ) level increase acute decompensated heart failure , 2 ) whether transition acute stable heart failure correlate decrease level , 3 ) whether serial change level time . BNP known marker stress myocardium use detect myocardial stretch stress heart disease . IL-6 TNF alpha inflammatory marker show elevated inflammatory state heart failure . CRP another inflammatory marker . Knowing level helpful correlate serum caspase-3 p17 level know serum factor CHF . By check level marker every 3 month ( +/- one month ) stable HF patient two year , goal see `` spike '' level predict adverse outcome CHF . Ultimately , case , identify patient `` spike '' cumulative high caspase-3 fragment high risk morbidity/mortality . Identification patient may cause u treat proactively attempt alter outcome . We also obtain blood sample control subject measure baseline level determine diurnal rhythm variation .</detailed_description>
