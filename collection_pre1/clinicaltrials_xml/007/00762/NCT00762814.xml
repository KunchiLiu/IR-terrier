	<brief_summary>Some individual Parkinson disease experience `` freezing '' walk result inability move foot . They often difficulty start move stop . Freezing often result loss balance fall . Oral medication Parkinson disease n't effective treat freeze reduce symptom . Another treatment freeze instruction walk use visual target auditory cue ( think rhythm beat ) . These cue initially effective individual , effect last . Other type cue study . We want examine effect two cue , tactile ( touch ) motor ( muscle contraction ) , effect freeze .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Sensory Motor Cues Using Electrical Stimulation Reduce Gait Freezing Patients With Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We use device ( TENS unit ) provide electrical stimulation nerve low leg . Electrodes place skin low leg box delivers electrical current cause tingle feel leg . Subjects ask perform three gait task device compare effect sensory cue speed/time complete gait task frequency duration freeze event . This use device ( TENS unit ) investigational . While approve Food Drug Administration treatment pain , approve treatment freezing . Because TENS unit provide sensory cue , may help prevent reduce freeze . If find cue work , could lead new treatment treatment freezing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . PD diagnostic criterion include use clinically define `` definite PD '' , previously outlined22 base upon establish criteria.22 , 23 2. history consistent freeze ambulation straight line and/or turn . 3. normal central peripheral neurological function 4. least grade 4 strength normal joint range motion legs 5. normal somatosensory function foot ( joint position sense ) , except neurological diagnosis use levodopa . 6 . Each must clear benefit levodopa least his/her PD symptoms 7 . All subject PD must able walk independently 10 foot . 1. serious medical problem would impair ability undergo testing . 2. use neuroleptic dopamineblocking drug 3. use drug might affect balance 4. history evidence neurological deficit could interfere , previous stroke muscle disease 5. participant unable provide inform consent</criteria>
