	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial Vorinostat Combination With Bevacizumab &amp; Irinotecan Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug Administration : ( A cycle 28 day ) Irinotecan bevacizumab give IV day 1 15 cycle . Vorinostat give orally day 1-7 15-21 cycle . Vorinostat ( provide 100mg capsule ) begin dose 200mg/day , escalate 300mg/day maximum 400mg/day . Vorinostat take prior irinotecan bevacizumab day 1 15 . The drug administer time every day day 2-7 16-21 . Patients treat prophylactically compazine 30 minute prior vorinostat , turn , take 30 minute prior meal whenever possible . Irinotecan give dose 125mg/m² . Bevacizumab give dose 10mg/kg . Maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define toxicity occur first 4 week therapy . Three patient treat dose level one enrol simultaneously . They must observe dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) least 4 week treatment day 1 . Page 15 protocol outline dose escalation parameter . At least 9 patient treated MTD . If DLT achieve cohort dose level 400mg/day vorinostat , dose escalation make . This dose become recommend dose . Patients demonstrate evidence benefit may treat maximum 24 cycle , investigator 's discretion .</detailed_description>
