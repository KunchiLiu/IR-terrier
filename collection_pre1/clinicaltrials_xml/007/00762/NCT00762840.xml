	<detailed_description>Periapical lesion consist inflammatory tissue replace bone surround root-tip ( apex ) cause bacteria present infected root canal ( Metzger 2000 ) . Endodontic ( root canal ) treatment perform eliminate bacteria root canal prevent recontamination . The periapical lesion expect heal response procedure , new bone replace soft tissue lesion . The heal lesion may last 6-48 month , depend size individual healing rate ( Wang et al 2004 ) . Not lesion heal accordingly . Those fail heal subject either non-surgical re-treatment surgical procedure call `` apicoectomy '' ( Kim &amp; Kratchman 2006 ) . The surgical procedure consist cut gum , access periapical tissue hole drill cortical bone , follow curetting soft tissue bony crypt . After surgical procedure , bone heal much quicker ( Kvist &amp; Reit 1999 ) even relatively large lesion may heal within 3-6 month . Nevertheless , pain swell usually inflict great discomfort cause patient lose 6 work day ( Kvist &amp; Reit 2000 ) . It common practice delay final dental restoration ( crown bridge ) long periapical lesion heal . Even though surgical intervention could significantly reduce wait time , commonly apply due following : ( ) Pain , discomfort loss work day , ( b ) High cost ( c ) Inaccessibility many root tip , due anatomical reason . Apexum develop family miniature , minimally invasive surgical tool , facilitate highly innovative method treatment periapical lesion associate root canal infection . The Apexum Ablator device allow access periapical tissue root-canal follow commonly accept root-canal procedure . The inserted tool grind periapical lesion , follow washing aspiration ground material . In present study , safety efficacy Apexum Ablator assess patient periapical lesion associate root canal infection use clinical investigational plan .</detailed_description>

These may include upper low single root incisor , canine premolar , well root multirooted teeth , provide single root canal per root . These may include distal root low molar , palatal distobuccal root upper molar 3 . Lesion mean diameter : 36 mm , PAI score 4 5 4 . Roots mature fully form apex 1 . Previous root canal filling 2 . Roots abnormal root canal morphology 3 . Roots one root canal per root , either evident preoperative radiograph discover initiation root canal treatment 4 . A tooth remain symptomatic first need second session root canal treatment ( remain excessive sensitivity percussion , persistent sinus tract , persistent exudate root canal etc . ) 5 . Unrestorable teeth 6 . Significant periodontal pocket 7 . Lack cortical bone around lesion , judge clinically 8 . Active acute infection cellulite , abcess 9 . Proximity anatomical structure periapical lesion extent Apexum Ablator enucleation procedure may damage otherwise jeopardize structure . Such anatomical structure may include maxillary sinus , nasal cavity , inferior alveolar nerve canal , mental nerve structure may jeopardize procedure 10 .
