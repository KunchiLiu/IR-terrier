	<brief_title>Evaluation Accuracy Precision Masimo Labs Pulse-Hemoglobin-Meter Monitor Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood hemoglobin concentration common essential test ass patient well need blood transfusion . In perioperative period measurement critical mainly due acute nature blood loss need immediate response . Currently , hemoglobin concentration determine analyze blood sample . It require venipuncture arterial puncture ( via arterial line ) . Besides patient discomfort additional disadvantage infection , deal blood product , delay diagnosis , low update rate cost . Masimo Labs process develop noninvasive monitor detect hemoglobin concentration real time . The monitor use probe place patient finger give hemoglobin concentration continuously noninvasively . Masimo Labs use technology resembles well accept clinically proven pulse-oxymeter . The study include surgical patient UCI Medical Center , preferably case know involve major blood loss . For case , anesthesia team place arterial line anesthesia purpose . The arterial line use continuous blood pressure measurement blood draw assessment several index . We plan compare hemoglobin concentration measure blood sample Masimo Labs pulse-hemoglobin level reading .</detailed_description>
