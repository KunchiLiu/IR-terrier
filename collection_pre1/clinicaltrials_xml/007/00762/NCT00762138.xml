	<detailed_description>Device Name . The device subject Post-Market Surveillance ( PMS ) Program AutoloGel™ System clear market Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) application BK060007 . The AutoloGel™ System include . AutoloGel™ Centrifuge II AutoloGel™ System Wound Dressing Reagent Kits include single-use , disposable component perform patient phlebotomy , centrifuge blood derive PRP activate apply AutoloGel . The Instructions Use include detailed description procedure make AutoloGel list Kit component provide end Instructions . Indications Use . The AutoloGel™ System intend use point-of-care safe rapid preparation platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) gel small sample patient 's blood . Under supervision healthcare professional , PRP gel produce AutoloGel™ System suitable exude wound , leg ulcer , pressure ulcer , diabetic ulcer management mechanically surgically-debrided wound . Dosing . The AutoloGel™ System may use chronic surgically-debrided wound twice week eight ( 8 ) week . The treat health care practitioner may elect continue treatment twelve ( 12 ) week . The AutoloGel™ System use conjunction standard care procedure comprehensive wound management . Removal necrotic infect tissue Off-loading Compression therapy venous stasis ulcer Establishment adequate blood circulation Maintenance moist wound environment Management wound infection Wound cleanse Nutritional support , include blood glucose control subject diabetic ulcer Bowel bladder care subject pressure ulcer risk contamination Management underlying disease Precautions Warnings . Caution . Federal Law ( U.S.A. ) restrict device sale order Physician . Precautions . Throughout process procedure application AutoloGel™ , use universal precaution define facility policy procedure manual . All part procedure shall perform manner minimize splashing , spray , spatter , generation potential droplet . Warnings . AutoloGelTM produce use bovine thrombin . The use topical bovine thrombin preparation occasionally associate abnormality hemostasis range asymptomatic alteration laboratory determination , prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) , severe bleed thrombosis rarely fatal . These hemostatic effect appear relate formation antibody bovine thrombin / factor V case may cross react human factor V , potentially result factor V deficiency . Repeated clinical application topical bovine thrombin increase likelihood antibody thrombin / factor V may form . Consultation expert coagulation disorder recommend patient exhibit abnormal coagulation laboratory value , abnormal bleed abnormal thrombosis follow use topical thrombin . Any intervention consider immunologic basis condition . Patients antibody bovine thrombin preparation re-exposed product . Allergic reaction may encounter person know sensitive bovine material . Because thrombin 's action clotting mechanism , AutoloGel must inject otherwise allow enter large blood vessel . Extensive intravascular clot even death may result .</detailed_description>
