	<brief_title>Features Predict Success With Nonoperative Treatment Patients With Rotator Cuff Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff tear find 40 % people age 50 prevalence increase age . While people remain asymptomatic , unknown develop symptom . In symptomatic patient , surgical repair torn rotator cuff fail 30-50 % patient , yet majority patient significant reduction pain despite failure repair . Nonoperative treatment report successful outcomes 25-82 % patient yet know patient-related feature predict success nonoperative treatment . The general aim research effort identify patient feature ( historical information , physical examination finding , MRI-based pathology ) would predict success ( define reduction visual analog pain scale , patient satisfaction ) nonoperative treatment rotator cuff tear . The propose study design prospective cohort study patient rotator cuff tear follow standard physical therapy program derive evidence base medicine ( EBM ) systematic review Level 1 Level 2 study . Study effect historical information predict success ( determined pain relief patient satisfaction ) nonoperative treatment use EBM base physical therapy program treating patient rotator cuff tear . Study effect physical examination finding predict success nonoperative treatment use EBM-based physical therapy program treating patient rotator cuff tear . Study effect severity rotator cuff pathology ( use standardize magnetic resonance imaging protocol ) predict success nonoperative treatment patient rotator cuff tear use EBM-based physical therapy program .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>• Patients ( 18100 year age ) MRI finding fullthickness rotator cuff tear Note : Criteria obtain shoulder MRI evaluate rotator cuff tear [ Appendix D ] : 1 . Significant weakness ( ≥ 2 point per guideline . ) 2 . ADL pain night pain &gt; /= 7 VAS 3 . Significant impingement ( per guideline ) + significant symptom ≥ 3 month . Acute rotator cuff tear ( generally due high velocity injury symptom less one month ) Associated dislocation Associated fracture Systemic Rheumatologic disease , i.e . Rheumatoid Arthritis Systemic Lupus Erythematosis Patients treat bilateral rotator cuff tear simultaneously Patients unable complete form Pain neck scapula Previous shoulder surgery Glenohumeral arthritis ( meet ≥ 1 criterion ) osteophytes &gt; 2mm humeral head glenoid Joint space narrow sclerosis cyst formation see true AP axillary radiograph ; humeral head contact acromion Adhesive capsulitis</criteria>
