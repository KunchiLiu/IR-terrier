	<brief_summary>Pain prior surgery particular concern patient undergo total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) since important predictor pain poor function 2-3 year surgery . Previous study investigate various treatment manage pain surgery . However , study investigate short long term effect pregabalin term functional rehabilitation , pain outcome anxiety follow total hip arthroplasty . Therefore , aim present study determine follow : ( 1 ) perioperative pregabalin administration positively influence early rehabilitation recovery physical function determine effect maintain 6 week 3 month post surgery . ( 2 ) To determine perioperative pregabalin administration reduce postoperative movement evoke pain associate rehabilitation effect also maintain 6 week 3 month post surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION . Participants ask consider take part research study schedule total hip surgery . In study compare effect pain medication know Pregabalin compare placebo rehabilitation recovery physical function pain associate rehabilitation . We monitor patient progress hospital follow-up participant 6 week 3 month post surgery . At Holland Orthopedic Arthritic Centre use different method control postoperative pain . Postoperative pain relief usually control morphine use pump participant control , sometimes call `` PCA '' ( Patient Controlled Analgesia ) . Participants also receive combination tablet like anti-inflammatory ( Celecoxib ) , opioids ( strong pain killer ) , get best pain relief possible few side effect . Anti-Inflammatories type pain medicine reduces swell ( inflammation ) . We would like see compare recovery profile participant receive pain management plan , addition Pregabalin receive placebo .

This study examine whether Pregabalin add patient 's pain management plan help rehabilitate effectively less pain . Part research involve collection information study participant describe pain discomfort experience surgery . After surgery , participant ask much pain nursing staff . In order address issue , ask provide follow information various interval hospital stay : 1 . Pain intensity - use Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) 0=no pain 10=Terrible Pain record three time daily hospital stay . Participants also ask rate pain several rehabilitation measure Postoperative day 1 4 . 2 . Participants also ask feeling nauseate , feel like vomit , feel drowsy . After Total Hip Arthroplasty , important patient receive standardize rehabilitation protocol . At Holland Orthopedic Arthritic Centre , Primary Hip Replacement Care Pathway accompany standardized rehabilitation treatment protocol . While patient hospital , meet physiotherapist put series hip exercise . The physiotherapist record much movement perform hip every day hospital . On postoperative day 2 day 4 study participant , addition daily hip exercise , ask perform walk test best ability . Participants time , physiotherapist ask participant stand chair walk 3 meter comfortable safe pace . Participants turn walk back chair , sit . In order participant familiar test perform exercise operation obtain baseline score . At completion walk test , participant also ask provide final pain assessment painful walk test . On postoperative day 4 , 6 week 3 month participant ask perform rehabilitation measure . One time six minute walk test ( 6 week 3 month ) , mean measure far walk 6 minute . The measure one requiring participant walk stair , good understanding test perform test prior surgery .</detailed_description>
