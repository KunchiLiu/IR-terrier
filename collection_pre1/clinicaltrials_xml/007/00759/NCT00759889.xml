	<detailed_description>The criterion consider wound biopsy give patient chronic wound ( venous leg ulcer , diabetic foot ulcer , decubitus ulcer ) present two ( 2 ) month fail progress towards heal ( le 20 % decrease size 2-week period time ) . Also suspicious wound cancer strongly consider clinical basis biopsied immediately without arbitrary timeline impose .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subject must wind , require biopsy least one follow reason : The wound clinically suspicious ( raise fibrotic edge , patchy discoloration edge , `` invasive appearance '' , appearance substantially different normal chronic wound appearance ) . The wound present 3 month standard care management least 1 month show progression towards heal . No progression towards heal define less 20 % reduction size wind 2week period time . The subject must least 18 year age . The ulcer biopsied must great 3 centimeter area . Unacceptable risk bleeding determine investigator . Medical emotional risk associate potential biopsy outweighs risk take biopsy determine investigator . Note : Vulnerable population exclude study represent chronic wound population , care take explain study family member caretaker stakeholder subject 's care , concerned party agreement subject 's enrollment study .</criteria>
