	<brief_summary>Study Objectives : - identify neurophysiologic effect venlafaxine treatment normal control use quantitative EEG ( QEEG ) cordance - examine effect venlafaxine different rating scale measure mood anxiety ( e.g. , Ham-D , BDI , SCL-90 , POMS-BI , Visual Analog Mood Scale , SSRS , SASS , Q-LES-Q SF-36 ) well measure cognitive psychosocial function ( i.e. , Stroop , PASAT , RAVLT , Trailmaking A B , Digit-Symbol , Grooved Pegboard , Multidimensional Health Locus Control , Temperament Character Inventory , Interpersonal Support Evaluation List , Godin Leisure-Time Questionnaire , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ) normal control subject , association change cordance change think memory . - identify physiologic effect venlafaxine treatment normal control use heart rate immune function measure</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pilot data suggest depressed patient treat fluoxetine venlafaxine , QEEG cordance detects change brain function within individual subject soon two day initiation treatment . Changes cordance appear specific ( i.e. , occur absence clinical improvement ) , frequently precede examiner rating improvement ( Leuchter et al. , 1997 ; Cook et al. , submission ) . In addition , pattern cordance baseline may indicate patient likely respond fluoxetine venlafaxine treatment ( Cook et al. , 1999 ) . Findings use cordance contrast report previous QEEG study antidepressant medication , perform depress well normal control subject . These study show QEEG effect antidepressant medication , decrease theta alpha band activity , relate change clinical state . In particular , normal subject receive antidepressant medication report show change conventional QEEG power measurement may useful characteristic antidepressant medication medication development purpose . Similar change QEEG power report depressed subject show clinical improvement ( Saletu et al 1982 , 1983 , 1985 , 1986 , 1987 , 1988 ; Sannita et al 1983 , 1990 ; Itil et al 1984 ; Herrmann et al. , 1991 ; Luthringer et al. , 1996 ) . The relationship immediate EEG change control subject eventual clinical response depress population unclear . Other QEEG work depress subject find change baseline theta power early course treatment may characterize group depressed patient likely respond antidepressant treatment ( Ulrich et al. , 1994 ) . Unfortunately , change lack specificity allow response prediction individual subject , physiologic meaning change theta power clear . We previously show absolute relative power complementary measure brain activity ( Leuchter et al. , 1993 ) . Cordance new QEEG measure combine information absolute relative power measure ( Leuchter et al. , 1994 ) . In validation data collect simultaneously 15O positron emission tomography ( PET ) , cordance value theta frequency band ( 4-8 Hz ) find positively correlated cortical perfusion , correlation strong perfusion either absolute relative theta power ( Leuchter et al. , 1999 ) . The correlation cordance regional cortical perfusion provide physiologic context interpret measure . In series depress subject receive open-label treatment , previously show cordance detects change prefrontal activity ( use within-subjects design ) early three day treatment patient later show clinical response antidepressant medication . Subjects respond antidepressant medication , well receive placebo , show early change cordance ( Leuchter et al 1997 ; Cook et al 1998 ; Cook et al. , submission ) . These data suggest QEEG cordance may specific indicator antidepressant treatment effectiveness traditional QEEG power measure , since antidepressant non-responders placebo treat subject show early change measure . It important , however , determine effect observe depressed subject treatment specific population , see normal control well . First , examination specificity normal control treatment logical first step process examine group , eventually include patient group . Second , examination normal subject help u determine whether observed change brain function pharmacodynamic effect antidepressant medication could see individual , effect see exclusively depressed subject early course effective antidepressant treatment .</detailed_description>
