	<brief_summary>Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) genetic disorder develop boy . It cause mutation gene dystrophin , protein important maintain normal muscle structure function . Loss dystrophin cause muscle fragility lead weakness loss walk ability childhood teenage year . A specific type mutation , call nonsense ( premature stop codon ) mutation , cause DMD approximately 10-15 % boys disease . Ataluren orally deliver , investigational drug potential overcome effect nonsense mutation . This study Phase 2a extension trial evaluate long-term safety ataluren boys nonsense mutation DMD , determine adverse event laboratory abnormality . The study also assess change walk , muscle function , strength , important clinical laboratory measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2a Extension Study Ataluren ( PTC124 ) Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2a , multicenter , open-label safety efficacy study perform 3 site United States . The study enroll 38 subject nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy participate previous Phase 2a study ataluren ( Protocol Number PTC124-GD-004-DMD ) . Subjects receive study drug 3 time per day ( breakfast , lunch , dinner ) approximately 96 week ( approximately 2 year ) . Study assessment perform clinic visit screen , every 6 week first 24 week , every 12 week end study . Additional safety laboratory test , may perform investigational site accredit local laboratory clinic , require every 3 week first 24 week every 6 week Week 24 Week 48 . Subjects biceps muscle biopsy ataluren treatment 24 week ataluren treatment evaluate change muscle dystrophin expression . An evaluation effect ataluren corticosteroid pharmacokinetics perform . Associated ataluren clinical trial substudy use magnetic resonance evaluation ass change composition muscle leg .</detailed_description>
