	<brief_title>The Role Mineralocorticoid Receptors Vascular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study intend determine whether activation mineralocorticoid receptor affect vascular function . Vascular function relies two component blood vessel : inner lining ( endothelium ) vascular smooth muscle . In specific aim 1 , seek determine inhibition enzyme 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( 11-beta-HSD ) impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation and/or vascular smooth muscle function . The syndrome apparent mineralocorticoid excess ( AME ) rare disorder identify approximately 50 individual characterize low-aldosterone hypertension , associate low renin hypokalemia These subject avidly retain salt water , suppression plasma renin aldosterone level , clinically appear though state mineralocorticoid excess . A detailed series investigation elucidate cause syndrome : severe attenuation enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( 11-beta-HSD ) . 11-beta-HSD convert cortisol , able activate mineralocorticoid receptor cortisone , . This abnormality identify measure abnormal ratio urinary breakdown product cortisol cortisone . Subjects AME high ratio indicative elevate cortisol concentration . Although classical AME rare syndrome specific recessive inheritance , several mutation identify cause vary severity disease . Recent evidence suggest mild abnormality pathway may much common . In fact two study demonstrate subject essential hypertension great level cortisol/cortisone urinary level match control . Thus , mild abnormality enzyme may important contributor segment patient high blood pressure . Further , pathway consumption excess black licorice cause hypertension . Black licorice contains glycyrrhizic acid selectively inhibit 11 beta-HSD . Glycyrrhizic acid use dietary sweetener sell `` health-food '' store may also play epidemiological role hypertension . Analogous renin-angiotensin system , 11-beta-HSD found kidney , find vascular endothelial ( inner lining ) smooth muscle cell . Hypertension , similar risk factor cardiovascular disease impairs vascular function . One major effect decrease bioavailability endothelium-derived nitric oxide . Nitric oxide contributes importantly vascular homeostasis modulate vascular tone , inhibit platelet aggregation coagulation , inhibition translocation leukocytes vascular wall . Further , patient hypertension increase endothelin-1 production receptor activation . Endothelin-1 antagonizes beneficial activity nitric oxide . Experimentally , inactivation 11 beta-HSD rat model demonstrate cause hypertension , increase endothelin receptor A activation decrease bioavailability endothelium-derived nitric oxide . Inhibition mineralocorticoid receptor model prevents impairment vascular function . Thus , animal model , abnormality pathway may cause hypertension , create environment favorable development progression atherosclerosis . Further , recent evidence suggest activation pathway contribute importantly morbidity mortality patient congestive heart failure . A large , randomize study demonstrate small dose mineralocorticoid inhibitor , spironolactone , substantially reduce morbidity mortality patient severe heart failure . Experimentally , spironolactone improve vascular function patient congestive heart failure . Therefore , seek characterize vascular effect pathway human . This submission involve one protocol : 1 ) determine reversible inhibition 11 beta-HSD decrease bioavailability endothelium-derived nitric oxide impairs vascular smooth muscle function .</detailed_description>
