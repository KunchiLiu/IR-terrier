	<brief_title>D-Cycloserine Facilitation Cocaine - Cue Extinction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cocaine dependence remain serious problem United States today spite two decade intense research , efficacious pharmacotherapeutic treatment identify . Cocaine-associated environmental cue elicit drug craving exposure cocaine-related cue likely involved relapse . Emerging data support role glutamate extinction learn . D-cycloserine ( DCS ) , partial glutamate agonist , facilitate extinction associative learning animal model fear-conditioning clinical study exposure treatment anxiety disorder . A recent study demonstrate DCS acceleration extinction cocaine-induced conditioned place preference rat ( Botreau et al. , 2006 ) . Exploration DCS facilitate extinction response drug-related cue human need . The propose study extend innovative promising finding basic science arena anxiety disorder field proof concept investigation DCS facilitation extinction response cocaine-related cue human laboratory paradigm . In addition , examine neural substrate extinction learning , sub-set individual willing eligible undergo fMRI scan procedure extinction protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Subjects must able provide inform consent function intellectual level sufficient allow accurate completion assessment instrument . 2 . Subjects must meet DSMIV criterion current cocaine dependence . Subjects may meet criterion abuse , dependence substance exception nicotine alcohol . Because high comorbidity cocaine alcohol nicotine dependence , exclude nicotine alcohol dependence would seriously compromise feasibility recruitment . Nicotine use immediately prior cue exposure/extinction session control . Although individual meet criterion alcohol dependence accept study participation , anyone measurable blood alcohol level day session exclude acute alcohol intake increase serum level DCS low seizure threshold . 3 . Use one follow method birth control female subject : birth control pill , barrier method ( diaphragm condom spermicide ) , surgical sterilization , use intrauterine contraceptive device , complete abstinence sexual intercourse . 4 . Subjects must live within 50mile radius research facility reliable transportation . 5 . Subjects must consent remain abstinent drug abuse ( except nicotine ) prior first session final session . 6 . Subjects must consent random assignment DCS vs. placebo condition . 7 . For fMRI participant , subject must righthanded . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Women pregnant , nurse childbearing potential practicing effective mean birth control . 2 . Subjects evidence history significant hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , neurological disease include insulindependent diabetes , condition may affect heart rate skin conductance measurement . 3 . Subjects history current psychotic disorder , current major depressive disorder , bipolar affective disorder severe anxiety disorder may impact cue reactivity . 4 . Subjects unwilling unable maintain abstinence alcohol drug abuse ( except nicotine ) prior cue procedure . 5 . Subjects meet DSMIV criterion substance dependence ( nicotine , alcohol cocaine appropriate ) within past 60 day . 6 . Subjects currently take Bblockers , antiarrhythmic agent , psychostimulants agent know interfere heart rate skin conductance monitoring . 7 . Known suspected hypersensitivity DCS . 8 . Individuals take medication could adversely interact study medication , include , limited ethionamide , isoniazid , amino acid supplement . 9 . Subjects history epilepsy seizure disorder . 10 . Subjects significant liver impairment , DCS may increase serum transaminase . 11 . For fMRI participant , need maintenance acute treatment psychoactive medication include antiseizure medication could potentially interfere fMRI . 12 . For fMRI participant , clinically significant psychiatric medical problem would impair participation limit ability participate scan .</criteria>
