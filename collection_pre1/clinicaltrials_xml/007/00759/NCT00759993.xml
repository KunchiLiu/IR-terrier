	<brief_summary>A majority patient suffer mental illness treat serotonin regulating FDA approve medication . Some medication also block histamine transmission , increase blood prolactin level , induce insulin resistance , hyperlipidemia , promote sedation . All lead weight gain obesity . Many drug generally safe effective carry risk long term side effect acute gradual weight gain 10-30 pound month year treatment . The detrimental gain 7 % pre-drug weight report many antipsychotic , mood stabilizer antidepressant . This weight gain may subsequently add medical co-morbidity ( ie diabetes , hypertension , osteoarthritis , coronary artery diseasem , hyperlipidemia… ) This therapeutic manipulation brain serotonin functioning may associate abnormal increase carbohydrate craving , consumption weight gain . It possible insulin resistance occur direct effect indirect effect weight gain , particularly patient prone weight gain diabetes due genetic loading . Leptin , chemical associate feedback signal reduces appetite adipose tissue growth may also become insensitive . These multiple insult may lead bad weight gain patient take clozapine , olanzapine , mirtazapine . Diet exercise lifestyle modification usual initial intervention , though depressed , anxious , bipolar , schizophrenic often interfere ability make change . In fact study look weight loss intervention occur patient institutionalize , restrict diet may respond token economy system longer term inpatient unit stay . This token economy approach easily translate usual outpatient short term inpatient practice setting . In setting , lifestyle modification approach fail , patient may place FDA approve diet medication ( sibutramine , orlistat , ionamin… ) carry significant side effect risk . Some patient even place epilepsy medication zonisamide topiramate even great side effect risk . In similar weight gain prone group , grow literature diabetes population use high dose chromium improve ( lower ) insulin resistance way increase insulin binding cell , receptor number , insulin receptor kinase activity . Lower fast blood glucose level blood generally occur . Some report show reduction blood lipid/cholesterol level higher chromium dose well . Recently , chromium piccolinate study depressed patient , especially atypical feature ( usually fatigue , weight gain , carbohydrate craving ) . Although change depression symptom overall , carbohydrate craving improve . This paper present 2005 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting Atlanta . As foil , paper non-diabetics , non-depressed healthy volunteer show little effectiveness lower blood sugar level . Furthermore , one investigator ( JLM ) publish data show acute , clinically significant weightgain serotonergically treat psychiatric inpatient . The author theorize use chromium may reduce carbohydrate craving , appetite thus protect weight gain side effect . Given pivotal paper depress population , effectiveness data diabetes population possible metabolic tie two population , author wish study effect chromium piccolinate mentally ill subject start serotonergic manipulating medication inpatient treatment set . These patient follow inpatient stay follow discharge single visit determine acute interventional effect chromium piccolinate . We feel chromium piccolinate less toxic/hazardous many weght loss medication currently use therefore suggest long term randomize , control study subject receive active drug ( chromium piccolinate ) placebo start serotonergic treatment inpatient . The chromium piccolinate placbo obtain Nutrition 21 company , approve FDA source product .</brief_summary>
