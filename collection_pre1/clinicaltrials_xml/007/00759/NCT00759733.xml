	<brief_summary>Maternal cardiac disease complicate approximately 2 percent pregnancy lead cause non-obstetrical maternal death . Evaluating cardiac function dysfunction complex process require skilled clinician technology ECG , long-term monitoring , echocardiography . A fast , easily obtain blood test B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) develop give evidence heart muscle stretch dysfunction among adult suspect congestive heart failure . Preliminary experience indicate ventricular dysfunction among OB patient history heart disease detect serum assay . A prospective cohort design consist two group pregnant patient ; one history cardiac disease one without , follow course pregnancy cardiac function measure use echocardiography serum BNP . It hop blood test BNP reliable way help evaluate OB patient suspect abnormal heart function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence cardiac disease pregnancy 2 percent , lead cause non-obstetrical maternal mortality ( 1 ) . Women known cardiac disease suspect cardiac dysfunction monitor evaluated pregnancy , labor , delivery , post partum electrocardiogram , long-term rhythm recording , echocardiogram ( 2 ) . Physiological change occur normal pregnancy include 43 % increase cardiac output , 45 50 % increase intravascular volume , 14 % decrease serum colloid osmotic pressure , 28 % decrease colloid osmotic pressure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ratio . These hemodynamic change believe maintain adequate uteroplacental perfusion , meet increase oxygen nutritional demand throughout gestation protect sudden hemodynamic change precipitate blood loss , decrease venous return heart , hypotension ( 3 ) . B-type natriuretic peptide [ BNP ] release ventricular myocardium response increase ventricular wall tension stretch . A rapid assay measurement serum BNP level develop clinical use evaluation dyspnea relate ventricular dysfunction . Serum BNP determination describe high level diagnostic accuracy congestive heart failure cause dyspnea single historical , physical , laboratory finding . When used conjunction clinical information , rapid assay serum BNP level useful establish exclude cardiac dysfunction cause acute onset dyspnea ( 4 ) . During uncomplicated pregnancy , serum BNP level remain level see non-pregnant woman . Among patient severe preeclampsia , serum BNP level observe rise eight time baseline value . Decreased leave ventricular ejection fraction percentage fractional shortening within myocardium observe preeclampsia group compare normal pregnancy group . The degree structural functional change linearly related degree elevation cardiac natriuretic peptide , include B-type natriuretic peptide level ( 5 ) . Preliminary clinical experience indicate serum BNP level obtain commercially available rapid assay method may relate degree ventricular dysfunction among obstetrical patient acute dyspnea associate preeclampsia , tocolysis therapy , underlie history cardiopulmonary disease ( 6 ) . The purpose protocol determine prospectively measurement serum BNP level correlate cardiac function change note echocardiography clinically among pregnant woman history cardiac disease . This group compare group pregnant woman history cardiac disease . Specific Objectives The specific objective study include follow : 1 . Establish cohort subject history heart disease diagnosis cardiac disease , either congenital acquire , pregnant wish continue pregnancy delivery . 2 . Provide standard obstetrical cardiac care subject fetus would indicate type , nature , degree cardiac disease present first trimester delivery . 3 . Study intervention include series echocardiogram begin time pregnancy diagnosis proceed end post partum time frame . These study take place first , second , third trimester , labor , two three day delivery , six week post partum . 4 . With echocardiogram serum BNP level drawn measure correlation finding note echocardiography . 5 . Additional data may collect individual subject require additional evaluation echocardiography and/or BNP serum measurement base clinical indication . 6 . Establish cohort control subject history cardiac disease echocardiography serum BNP measurement schedule describe subject history cardiac disease comparison . 7 . At completion study , description physiologic change cardiac function cardiac disease cohort attributable subject ' history cardiac disease versus attributable normal physiologic change pregnancy available . 8 . At completion study , description change serum level BNP reflect cardiac dysfunction . Study Design This study protocol employ prospective cohort design . A group woman history cardiac disease pregnancy identify potential subject study cohort . Each potential subject initial assessment cardiac history , condition , functional status . A detailed review complete medical , surgical , gynecologic , obstetrical history obtain dictated standard care . Appropriate management potential subject 's medical obstetrical care initiate undertaken accepted clinical practice . Potential subject cohort obstetrical patient either care directly consultation Regional Perinatal Center , Division Maternal Fetal Medicine , Department Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology , SUNY Upstate Medical University . A second group woman history cardiac disease pregnancy also identify potential subject control cohort . Each potential subject also initial assessment medical , surgical , gynecologic , obstetrical history dictate standard care . Appropriate management potential subject 's medical obstetrical care initiate undertaken accepted clinical practice . Potential subject cohort obstetrical patient either care directly consultation Regional Perinatal Center , Division Maternal Fetal Medicine , Department Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology , SUNY Upstate Medical University . In addition management give part standard medical obstetrical care , subject cohort series serum BNP measurement echocardiograms . A serum BNP measurement echocardiogram obtain first , second , third trimester , course labor delivery , 48 72 hour post-delivery , 6 8 week post-delivery . Additional study obtain indicated standard clinical indication . Serum BNP measurement make laboratory service available SUNY Upstate Medical University Crouse Hospital . Echocardiogram study perform Cardiology P.C . Pediatric Cardiology SUNY Upstate Medical University . A standard form use subject record result serum BNP measurement , result maternal echocardiogram , detail clinical course experience subject course pregnancy , labor , delivery , post-delivery care . Complications related cardiac function well medical obstetrical complication also record . Please see attached standard data collection form detail . At conclusion study , comparison make cohort woman cardiac disease cohort woman without cardiac disease . Specific comparison make regard serum BNP level , cardiac function measure echocardiography , clinical course . Statistical Methods , Data Analysis , Interpretation There prior publish report regard use rapid serum BNP assay evaluate cardiac function pregnancy woman know cardiac disease . From June 1 , 2003 May 31 , 2004 , Regional Perinatal Center SUNY Upstate Medical University provide obstetrical care consultation 55 patient ICD-9 Code 648.63 , cardiac disease pregnancy . Since pilot study , anticipate 20 subject cardiac disease cohort follow course 1 2 year , along control cohort . Specific measurement obtain echocardiography recorded measure cardiac function include : - Estimated leave ventricular ejection fraction - Estimated leave ventricular wall thickness - Estimated cardiac output - Right leave atrial chamber volume - Right leave ventricular chamber volume - Estimated pulmonary artery pressure Serum BNP measurement obtain record unit picograms/milliliter . Approximately 3-4 milliliter blood obtain per assay standard lavender-top tube standard blood sample method . The rapid quantitative assay BNP run TriageÂ® BNP Test ( International ) Biosite Diagnostics , Incorporated , San Diego , California . Measurements serum BNP correlate clinical course objective measure cardiac function determine echocardiography . A linear relationship elevation serum BNP measurement degree cardiac dysfunction expect . Elevated serum BNP cardiac dysfunction demonstrate echocardiogram also correlate clinical estimate NYHA functional status degree congestive failure .</detailed_description>
