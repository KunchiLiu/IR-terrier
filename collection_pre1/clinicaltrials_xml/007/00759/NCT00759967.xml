	<brief_summary>More 80 % patient end stage renal disease hypertension ; 70 % poorly control use conventional Hemodialysis therapy . An expanded extracellular fluid volume increase peripheral vascular resistance result hemodynamic/trophic effect increase sympathetic nerve activity , angiotensin II , asymmetrical dimethyl arginine , decrease nitric oxide frequently quote mechanism contribute hypertension population . The intermittent nature conventional hemodialysis treatment ( 4 hour , 3 days/week ) result majority patient sustained expansion extracellular fluid volume likely contribute activation neurohormonal pathway . However , daily therapy include short daily hemodialysis ( 2 hour , 6 days/week ) nocturnal hemodialysis ( 6-8 hour , 5-6 days/week ) improve even normalize blood pressure . Short daily hemodialysis appear improve blood pressure secondary reduction extracellular fluid volume ( 7,8 ) whereas improvement blood pressure nocturnal hemodialysis occur reduction peripheral vascular resistance ( 8,9,10 ) . This consistent Katzarski et al experience ( 7-8 hour , 3 days/week ) one randomize control trial blood pressure control due normalization extracellular fluid volume patient reduction peripheral vascular resistance others . The majority study daily dialysis observational , include run-in period optimize blood pressure management explore mechanisms improvement blood pressure detail . We design 9 month study determine mechanism short daily hemodialysis associate improvement blood pressure control secondary change sympathetic nervous system activity and/ extracellular fluid volume . Additionally would like explore potential impact short daily dialysis , compare conventional dialysis , marker inflammation oxidative stress detail .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional Hemodialysis vs. Short Daily Hemodialysis ( 6 Days / Week ) Mechanisms Blood Pressure Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients end stage renal disease adjust risk cardiovascular mortality 10-20 time great general population . Of modifiable risk factor , hypertension occur 80 % patient end stage renal disease poorly control 70 % patient . In several observational study daily hemodialysis , blood pressure improve despite reduction number antihypertensive medication . A randomized crossover study short daily hemodialysis also show improvement systolic blood pressure reduction leave ventricular mass index . In limited investigation , mechanism ( ) responsible improvement blood pressure attribute reduction extracellular fluid volume ( short daily ) reduction peripheral vascular resistance ( nocturnal hemodialysis ) . The study date limit fail include run phase optimize extracellular fluid volume prior initiation daily dialysis . Additionally , one study use standardize algorithm management blood pressure vital treatment blind . We design randomize , unblinded , 9 month cross-over study determine mechanism blood pressure control patient receive conventional ( 3 time /week ) HD short daily HD ( 6 time /week 2 hrs/tx ) . After complete 3 month run-in phase conventional HD patient 's dry weight antihypertensive medication adjust use standardized algorithm , patient randomize 3 month cross-over daily HD versus conventional HD . The mechanism improve blood pressure control explore use bioelectrical impedance measure extracellular fluid volume ( ECFV ) muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA ) well plasma catecholamine measure activity sympathetic nervous system . Additionally effect short daily HD , compare conventional HD , reactive oxygen specie marker inflammation examine Dr. Rhian Touyz lab . Lastly determine patient 's treatment preference .</detailed_description>
