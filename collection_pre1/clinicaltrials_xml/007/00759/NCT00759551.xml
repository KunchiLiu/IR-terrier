	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Azilsartan Subjects With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According National Health Nutrition Examination Survey , approximately 60 million people United States hypertensive . Although single risk factor responsible development hypertension , many risk factor control , . Controllable risk factor include weight gain , smoking , sedentary lifestyle , poor eat habit , emotional stress , physical tension , sodium sensitivity , alcohol abuse , use oral contraceptive . Uncontrollable risk factor include family history , gender , age race . Hypertension term `` silent killer '' many patient asymptomatic . Chronic hypertension cause extensive arterial wall damage , allow cholesterol adhere damage endothelial lining produce increase cardiac stress . Hypertension dramatically increase risk myocardial infarction , stroke , renal damage , impaired vision , heart failure overall mortality . Angiotensin II receptor blocker class drug use treatment hypertension decrease blood pressure , also likely contribute protect hypertensive individual cardiac event , stroke loss renal function . Angiotensin II significant physiological effect tissue organ throughout body include vascular smooth muscle , adrenal cortex , kidney , brain . Angiotensin II receptor locate plasma membrane target cell facilitate rapid onset angiotensin II . Three distinct subtypes angiotensin II receptor identify : angiotensin II type-1 receptor , angiotensin type 2 , angiotensin type 4 ; relative proportion vary tissue tissue . The angiotensin II type-1 receptor subtype express predominantly vascular smooth muscle cell activation angiotensin II result vasoconstriction , cell proliferation , fibrosis , cellular hypertrophy . In contrast , angiotensin II type-2 receptor stimulation produce pharmacologic activity opposite occur angiotensin II type-1 receptor stimulation . The angiotensin II type-4 receptor report expressed adrenal , brain , myocardium , exact function remain unknown . It consider play important role human pathogenesis . TAK-536 ( azilsartan ) synthetic angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist develop treatment mild moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension</detailed_description>
