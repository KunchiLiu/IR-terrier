	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn characteristic CLL , include gene chromosome abnormality proteins express leukemia cell , may help doctor predict patient receive standard treatment ( fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab ) first time experience complete remission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identifying Prognostic Factors Frontline FCR Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Fludarabine design make cancer cell less able repair damage DNA ( genetic material cell ) . This may increase likelihood cell die . Cyclophosphamide design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop growth spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Rituximab design attach lymphoma cell , may cause die . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 4-6 week . If find eligible take part study , Day 1 cycle , receive rituximab needle vein 6-8 hour . On Days 2-4 Cycle 1 Days 1-3 Cycles 2 beyond , receive fludarabine vein 30 minute . You also receive cyclophosphamide vein 30 minute . You receive drug ( Tylenol , Benadryl , Zofran , allopurinol , Valtrex ) help prevent side effect . If side effect receive rituximab , may monitor study staff 2 hour dose . Study Visits : Once week , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . After 3 month ( 3 cycle treatment ) , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspirate biopsy check status disease . Length Study : You treatment 6 month . You take treatment early intolerable side effect disease get bad . End-of-Treatment Visit : After treatment , end-of-treatment visit doctor learn overall response treatment . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspirate biopsy check status disease . Long-Term Follow-up : At 6 month finish treatment every year , follow-up visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy aspirate check status disease . This investigational study . Fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab FDA approve commercially available treatment CLL . The correlation response treatment characteristic leukemia cell investigational . Up 300 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
