	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose Stone Centre Serum Urine Bank provide researcher large number serum urine sample kidney stone patient control study stone disease detection treatment , take account different genetic background , age , patient factor provide broad sample size study stone disease The Serum Urine Bank undoubtedly invaluable tool quest understanding urinary stone disease . Objective : The objective research identify protein species compound responsible contribute kidney stone initiation propagation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : While great stride make surgical treatment kidney stone , mean identify high-risk patient prevention kidney stone lag far behind . Urinary stone disease common problem , cause significant disability sometimes death , cost society 1.8 billion dollar year . Therefore , important identify patient risk process develop kidney stone develop procedure halt and/or prevent stone formation . Unfortunately , current method use identify patient inadequate . Kidney stone patient undergo urine serum test attempt identify substance either excess deficit body . The level substance adjust diet modification and/or use medication . Often , patient correct abnormal value via diet medication others identifiable risk factor continue form stone . Clearly , current test method use identify continuous formation stone enough , largely due fact cause disease completely understood . There exist strong evidence support role protein , promote stone formation prevention . Furthermore may hereditary factor ( i.e . family history ) may increase risk patient become chronic kidney stone former . This suggest complex cause disease emphasize need importance identify gene protein involve formation stone . Research Methods : Urine serum sample collect study control group . Study group form confirm kidney stone patient follow post recovery , control group healthy individual . Control patient history kidney stone disease . Control subject may ask undergo screen renal ultrasound ensure stone free . If ureteral stent place surgery stone patient , remove , typically thrown garbage . With study , remove surface stent examine crystal adherent protein . The collected sample submit SELDI analysis measure non-protein component . Each patient 's serum sample also submit protein analysis . Other sample store indefinitely use . The urine , serum , ureteral stent obtain study bank -80C lock , secure area . Recruitment : Recruitment study group Urology Stone Clinic Diamond Health Care Centre Vancouver General Hospital Dr Joel Teichman 's Practice St Paul 's Hospitals . Patients ask participate urologist ( Drs Chew , Teichman , Nigro , Fenster Paterson ) research coordinator . Control patient match age sex study group . They history stone disease . The consent form provide participant one investigator clinical research coordinator involve study . This occur one urology clinic . Risks : The risk involve minimal ; draw blood result possible bleeding , fainting , bruise infection . Urine collection minimal risk . Benefits : There direct benefit take part urine serum banking . We anticipate information gain benefit others future provide detection treatment urinary stone disease . No reimbursement payment offer , expense patient result bank urine serum . Confidentiality : All sample cod preserve anonymity subject . Once distribute , sample label code . At point time patient identifier leave Stone Centre Serum Urine Bank .</detailed_description>
