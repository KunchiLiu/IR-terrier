History ocular trauma within past six month either eye History ocular infection ocular inflammation within past three month either eye . History clinically significant progressive retinal disease retinal degeneration , diabetic retinopathy , retinal detachment either eye . History severe ocular pathology ( include severe dry eye ) , either eye would preclude administration topical prostaglandin analogue .

Before Eligibility Visit , patient must perform Wash Out least four week intermittent glucocorticoid medication must able remain medication duration study . Use additional topical systemic ocular hyposensitive medication study . History bronchial asthma , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would preclude safe administration topical betablocker . Less 30 day stable dose regimen Screening Visit nonglaucoma medication substance administer route use chronic basis may affect IOP . These may include , limited following : Sympathomimetic agent Antimuscarinic agent Antihistamines Phenothiazines Tricyclic antidepressant Betaantagonist block agent Alpha agonists Alphaadrenergic block agent Calcium channel blocker Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor Cardiac gylcosides History evidence severe illness condition would make patient , opinion investigator , unsuitable study .</criteria>
