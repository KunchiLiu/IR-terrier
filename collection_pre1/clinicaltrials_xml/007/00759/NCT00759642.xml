	<brief_summary>Hormone receptor positive breast cancer common type breast cancer , comprise 70-80 % breast cancer . Endocrine therapy main type initial treatment patient type breast cancer . Endocrine therapy treatment try remove , block certain hormone bind cancer cell thus slow stop growth cancer . Although patient type breast cancer respond initially endocrine therapy , lose effectiveness . New therapy type cancer need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Failed Prior Antihormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endocrine therapy form backbone treatment early stage advance stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer . Although patient advanced estrogen receptor positive metastatic disease respond initially endocrine therapy , response short live . New therapy able provide additional benefit patient hormone receptor positive , endocrine-resistant , advanced metastatic breast cancer require . This study propose add lapatinib endocrine therapy treat hormone receptor positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
