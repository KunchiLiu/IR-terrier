	<detailed_description>Chronic hypertension common medical condition pregnancy , occur 5 percent pregnant woman . There significant maternal , fetal , neonatal morbidity mortality associate disease [ 1,2 ] . Chronic hypertension pregnancy define elevated blood pressure detect confirm 20th week gestation hypertension present prior conception . Chronic hypertension usually classify mild systolic blood pressure great equal 140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure great equal 90 mmHg . Severe hypertension define systolic blood pressure great equal 180 mmHg diastolic blood pressure great equal 110 mmHg [ 3 ] . Adverse outcomes associate chronic hypertension pregnancy include preterm delivery , intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) , intrauterine fetal demise ( IUFD ) , placental abruption , cesarean delivery [ 4 ] . The incidence superimpose preeclampsia report 50 percent woman severe chronic hypertension [ 5 ] . Many woman medical management anti-hypertensive medication pregnancy . Data lack regard improvement neonatal outcome , evidence anti-hypertensive medication may interfere uteroplacental blood flow fetal growth [ 3,6 ] . Despite lack support literature medication management hypertension pregnancy , current recommendation recognize role medication use least severe chronic hypertension [ 1 ] . The umbilical artery arise within fetal circulation common iliac artery represent dominant circulatory outflow distal aortic circulation contribute entirely placental circulation . Normal umbilical artery resistance blood flow progressively decrease throughout pregnancy , reflect progressive increase placental mass increase number tertiary villous small vessel placenta [ 7 ] . Doppler ultrasonography noninvasive technique use assess hemodynamic component vascular impedance within placenta . Umbilical artery Doppler flow velocimetry develop evaluate fetal condition en-utero [ 8 ] . Normally develop grow fetus characterize high velocity diastolic umbilical artery flow , IUGR decrease , absent , reverse diastolic flow [ 9,10 ] . Abnormal umbilical artery flow define presence absent reverse end diastolic flow flow index great two standard deviation report mean flow index give gestational age [ 11,12 ] . Evaluation umbilical artery hemodynamics indicate part standard care IUGR significant fetal anemia due iso-immunization suspect [ 7,8 ] . A group patient pregnancy complicate pregnancy-induced hypertension ( PIH ) treat anti-hypertensive drug labetalol nifedipine . These subject umbilical artery Doppler flow velocity resistance index measurement 27-32 week gestation 33-36 week gestation . An increase resistance index measurement note time . The author attribute increase umbilical artery resistance progression placental impairment due disease progression rather medication management PIH [ 13 ] . Another group patient pregnancy complicate preeclampsia significantly elevate umbilical artery systolic flow diastolic flow ( S/D ) ratio compare control group . When treated antihypertensive agent alpha-methyldopa , significant reduction umbilical artery S/D ratio group woman preeclampsia [ 14 ] . An in-vitro study undertaken isolated segment human umbilical cord evaluate measured umbilical artery resistance . The segment expose vary concentration common substance affect arterial tone use antihypertensive agent labetalol , alpha-methyldopa , nifedipine , magnesium sulfate . All except alpha-methyldopa demonstrated dose-dependant reduction umbilical artery resistance due direct umbilical artery smooth muscle relaxation [ 15 ] . The purpose study obtain information regard umbilical middle cerebral artery hemodynamics pregnancy complicate chronic hypertension manage anti-hypertensive medication compare measure value obtain pregnancy complicate chronic hypertension . We postulate use anti-hypertensive agent pregnancy significantly affect umbilical artery Doppler flow middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity measurement . Specific Objectives : 1 . Establish cohort subject history chronic hypertension require anti-hypertensive medication pregnancy act study group 2 . Establish cohort subject chronic hypertension take anti-hypertensive medication pregnancy act control group 3 . Obtain standard measurement utero-placental function two occasion third trim pregnancy , first 26 33 week gestation second 34 40 week gestation 4 . The measurement utero-placental function include estimate fetal weight , average gestational size , amniotic fluid index , umbilical artery S/D ratio , middle cerebral arterial peak velocity 5 . Compare result measurement make group two different time third trim pregnancy define difference potentially attributable medication use pregnancy 6 . Use result preliminary study estimate many subject would require identify statistically significant difference fetal hemodynamic measurement potentially attributable anti-hypertension agent use Study Design : This study employ prospective case-control design . A group woman history chronic hypertension manage anti-hypertensive medication identify potential subject study cohort . Each potential subject assessment hypertension history , management , associate vascular complication . A detailed review complete medical , surgical , gynecologic , obstetrical history obtain dictated standard care . Appropriate management potential subject 's medical obstetrical condition provide accord accepted practice . Potential subject cohort obstetrical patient care Regional Perinatal Center , Division Maternal Fetal Medicine , Department Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology , SUNY Upstate Medical University . A second group woman history chronic hypertension identify potential subject control cohort . Each potential subject detail review complete medical , surgical , gynecologic , obstetrical history obtain dictated standard care . Appropriate management potential subject 's medical obstetrical condition provide accord accepted practice . Potential subject cohort obstetrical patient care Regional Perinatal Center , Division Maternal Fetal Medicine , Department Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology , SUNY Upstate Medical University . The subject enrol cohort see Regional Perinatal Center management high-risk pregnancy . As part intensify obstetrical care , ultrasound evaluation interval fetal growth assessment estimate fetal weight , average gestational size , amniotic fluid index standard around 28 week gestation 35 week gestation . Umbilical artery Doppler study usually reserve fetus diagnosis suspect intrauterine growth restriction . Fetal middle cerebral artery peak flow velocity study usually reserve suspect severe fetal anemia use investigational basis suspect intrauterine growth restriction . We anticipate subject pregnancy complicate IUGR , therefore perform Doppler study umbilical artery S/D ratio middle cerebral arterial peak velocity standard care . Data collect database single computer site Regional Perinatal Center . This computer password protect reserve use care provider Perinatal Center investigator study . The database record specific patient identifier include subject name chart number . These specific identifier remove completion data collection prior data analysis . Statistical Methods , Data Analysis , Interpretation : There study publish regard use anti-hypertensive agent pregnancy effect agent umbilical artery hemodynamics . These study usually involve 20 30 subject . At point , enough information estimate many subject would require measure statistically significant difference potentially attributable use agent . For preliminary study , obtain 30 subject study cohort 30 subject control cohort . It anticipate take approximately one year complete study . Once data collection complete described , comparison mean undertaken umbilical artery Doppler study two cohort first second gestational age measurement .</detailed_description>
