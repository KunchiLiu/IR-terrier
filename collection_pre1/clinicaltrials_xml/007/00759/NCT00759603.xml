	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Rituximab Treatment Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may decrease growth cancer cell . Rituximab design bind protein , call cluster differentiation antigen 20 ( CD20 ) , surface leukemia cell , allow leukemia cell destroy immune system .

After , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn every 4 week routine test . At end Cycles 3 , 6 , 12 , bone marrow biopsy aspirate check status disease . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine blood test . If stay study past 12 cycle , every 6 cycle ( Cycles 18 , 24 , 30 , ) , bone marrow biopsy aspirate check status disease . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine blood test . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn often dose lenalidomide need change experience intolerable side effect . Pregnancy Testing : Women able become pregnant must negative urine blood ( le 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test 10-14 day 24 hour first dose lenalidomide , even menstrual period due treatment disease 1 menstrual period past 24 month .
