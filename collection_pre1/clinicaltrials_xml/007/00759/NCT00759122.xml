	<brief_summary>There two specific aim project : 1 . To identify physiologic indicator venlafaxine treatment response use quantitative EEG ( QEEG ) cordance , determine cordance change specifically associate response venlafaxine 2 . To identify predictor placebo response major depression use QEEG cordance/bispectral index ( BIS ) neuropsychological testing</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our previous work indicate combination neurophysiologic , symptom , cognitive measure may predict response accurately brain functional measure alone . The purpose study replicate result earlier work use similar study design ( 96-06-291-11 ) , also prospectively gather additional information substantiate comprehensive approach subject assessment yield accurate reproducible prediction treatment response . One major challenge involve clinical trial major depressive disorder ( MDD ) placebo response . The placebo response rate estimate 20 - 50 % subject enter standard clinical trial MDD . This high rate response placebo , may differ substantially response rate medication , make difficult demonstrate efficacy new antidepressant compound . Identification MDD subject placebo responder ( PR ) phenotype , either begin end clinical trial , could two major potential benefit . First , identification placebo responder prior enrollment clinical trial might make possible restrictive entry criterion , exclude subject trial . Segregation PR phenotype subject priori could reduce variance outcome data increase drug-placebo difference . This exclusion could reduce number subject require clinical trial render trial efficient . Second , identification PR phenotype clinical trial could make possible distinguish `` true medication '' placebo response . This distinction could make possible identify subgroup trial , enhance precision study medication effect . Our research group perform series placebo-controlled treatment trial MDD use combination behavioral rating , self-report , neurophysiologic measurement quantitative electroencephalography ( QEEG ) identify predictor placebo response medication response . The preliminary result previous study suggest combination neurophysiologic , symptom , cognitive measure may useful pretreatment prediction and/or early treatment detection different type treatment response . In study primary goal ass neurophysiologic , behavioral , cognitive assessment subject MDD set clinical trial replicate prospectively initial result completely identify characteristic different type treatment response clinical trial .</detailed_description>
