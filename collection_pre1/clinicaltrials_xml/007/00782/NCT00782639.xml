	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare incidence contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) follow administration iopamidol-370 ( Iopamiro-370 ) iodixanol-320 ( Visipaque 320 ) patient moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease diabetes mellitus undergoing cardiac angiography .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renal Safety Iopamidol Versus Iodixanol During Coronary Angiography Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase IV , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , parallel-group comparison iopamidol-370 iodixanol-320 patient high risk CIN , i.e. , patient : - Stage 3 4 CKD ( SCr level ≥ 1.5 mg/dL men ≥1.3 mg/dL woman eGFR 15 50 mL/min , - Diabetes mellitus would undergo clinically indicated cardiac angiography procedure . Approximately 10 investigative center participate study . This study enroll approximately 220 patient ensure 200 evaluable patient able complete study accord protocol . Patients randomize receive either iopamidol-370 iodixanol-320 . Each patient evaluate occurrence CIN within 48 72 hour postdose .</detailed_description>
