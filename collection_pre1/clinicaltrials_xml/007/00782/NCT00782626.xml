	<brief_title>Everolimus ( RAD001 ) Children With Chemotherapy-Refractory Progressive Recurrent Low-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine response child chemotherapy-refractory progressive low-grade glioma everolimus . Secondary - To evaluate pharmacogenetic polymorphism cytochrome P450 3A4 &amp; 3A5 allele P-glycoprotein/MDR influence metabolism everolimus patient population . - To evaluate role Apolipoprotein E genotypes predictor development hyperlipidemia therapy everolimus . - To assess preliminary correlation response change pharmacodynamic parameter include p70s6 kinase activity peripheral blood mononuclear cell . - To describe toxicity everolimus administer patient population . - To characterize pharmacokinetic profile everolimus administer patient population . STATISTICAL DESIGN : This study use one-stage design evaluate response everolimus . If least 3 responder observe 20 evaluable patient , everolimus consider promising . If true response rate 5 % ( null hypothesis ) , chance conclude treatment active 0.08 ( Type I error ) . If true response rate 25 % ( alternative hypothesis ) , chance conclude treatment active 0.91 ( power ) .</detailed_description>
