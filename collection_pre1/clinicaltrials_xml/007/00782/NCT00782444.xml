	<brief_summary>Project summary : Background : Computer navigation knee replacement surgery increasingly use around world , documentation usefulness lacking . In order critically evaluate new surgical method , want perform prospective , randomise clinical trial .

Also , data Norwegian arthroplasty register indicate difference long term survival implant . If difference functional outcome complication rate , two group , detect trial . Method : Patients age 50 85 year old , gonarthritis , need knee replacement , include trial . Radiostereometric analysis ( RSA ) , CT-scans , X-rays , clinical evaluation score system laboratory measure use evaluation process . A cost-effective analysis perform base data Norwegian life table , data SINTEF Norwegian arthroplasty register . Data Norwegian arthroplasty register statistically analyse separately knee replacement do computer navigation Norway last 5 year . Four Norwegian hospital collaborate trial ( Haukeland university hospital , Haugesund hospital , Haugesund sanitetsforenings hospital rheumatic disease Lovisenberg diakonale hospital ) patient recruit four hospital . Scientific impact/challenges : This trial probably great impact since good evidence support use computer navigation knee surgery lacking . It important patient confident he/she receive best treatment , important health care provider fund authority clear evidence choose two different treatment technique , order patient benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computer Navigation v Conventional Technique Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol 1 . Introduction : We perform prospective , randomize , clinically control RSA trial comparing : 1 . Profix cement bicompartmental knee prosthesis implant conventional intramedullary instrument vs 2 . Profix cement bicompartmental knee prosthesis implant use computer navigation ( Brainlab ) The trial take place orthopaedic department four hospital : Haukeland university hospital , Haugesund hospital , Haugesund sanitetsforening rheumatism hospital Lovisenberg diakonale hospital.The aim compare technical result ( implant positioning stability ) Profix knee prosthesis , perioperative morbidity clinical functional result compare two strategy . We also evaluate health economical aspect cost-effectiveness analysis . To complete project analyze data Norwegian arthroplasty register respect two different strategy . A doctoral fellowship part project . 2 . Background : In arthroplastic surgery , scientific evidence often lack . Haukeland university hospital Bergen Norwegian arthroplasty register closely tie , natural u critically evaluate usefulness evidence new implant instrumentation . Computer assist surgery well document neurosurgery , trial knee replacement surgery suggest usefulness . Some trial show well alignment position implant ( 1,10,12 ) . In addition , retrospective trial show alignment predictive implant survival i.e . good alignment give well implant survival . ( 7,8,9 ) Indirectly may indicate computer navigation superior regard implant survival . Further one might assume good alignment give well functional outcome , new surgical technique may less invasive , thus lead faster recovery . These question still remain unanswered . 3 . Challenges : To date long term study confirm definite association computer navigation well long term result knee replacement . No trial thoroughly investigate possible change functional outcome morbidity introduction computer navigation . 4 . Objectives : We seek find best treatment osteoarthritic patient need knee replacement . 1 . In trial investigate whether definite correlation computer navigate knee replacement well long term survival implant . Radiostereometric analysis ( RSA ) reveal micromotion implant trial know predict long term survival implant ( 19,20 ) . 2 . Some trial report higher perioperative morbidity patient treat conventionally , oppose treat assistance computer navigation ( 1,11 ) . Intramedullary rod may increase bleeding , may give high frequency postoperative delirium microemboli metabolic disturbance ( 16 ) . On hand , computer navigation often time consume , lead high risk infection . The fixation pin-fixators femur tibia reflection bead might weaken bone induce fracture risk zone . We see positive negative aspect computer navigation technique reveal trial . 3 . The computer navigation software , hardware surgical instrument add cost knee replacement procedure . Hence , important evaluate benefit compare cost . We analyze use registry data Markov decision analysis . 4 . The Norwegian arthroplasty register data Norwegian hospital . These data analyze publish regard computer navigate knee replacement . 5 ) Method : We randomize Profix cement bicompartmental total knee implant conventionally vs prosthesis implant assistance computer navigation . Profix standard implant Helse Vest good 5-year implant survival data Norwegian arthroplasty register ( 15 ) .Tantalum marker inject bone implant radiostereometric analysis ( RSA ) . The radiographic technique somewhat challenging recruit specially train educate radiographer obtain images.The image allow u localize every marker three dimensional coordinate system . Mathematic model calculate difference position one image another . Micromotion 0,1mm 0,2 degree detect . Micromotions within first two year correlate long term implant survival . The radiation dose low ( 10-20 % regular x-ray knee ) . The image processing calculation time consume expensive . Special software need therefore collaborate Kompetansesenter ortopediske implantater Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet ( NTNU ) . Prior inclusion patient , every surgeon perform 10 knee replacement computer assistance . All surgeon skilled perform 100 knee replacement conventional technique . A pilot study 12 patient ( 6 group ) perform . A total 200 patient ( 100 group ) include trial . Only 60 patient include RSA part trial . The precision RSA evaluate double investigation 1-year follow-up . The patient receives two image separate short period time . The patient first radiographed , he/she take walk investigation room , radiographed . Micromotion two image real , know precision method . The limit significant difference calculate 99 % confidence interval absolute difference double investigation . The upper limit `` mean error rigid body fitting '' `` condition number '' set 0,35mm 130 . These parameter describe stability marker spreading , express precision software . At least 20 patient need group , technical demand procedure drop-out risk , lead u include 30 patient group ( 23 ) . We aim reveal difference 0,5 degree two group alignment frontal plane measure CT-scan . Earlier research field indicate great variation conventional group ( standard deviation=1,3 ) computer navigate group ( standard deviation=0,9 ) ( 10 ) . With 80 % statistical power significance level 0.05 , power calculation suggest 79 patient group . Further , able detect difference 10 unit functional score ( KOOS ) ( 13 ) common standard deviation 20 ( 14 ) , power calculation suggest 94 patient group reach power 80 % significance level 0,05 . From calculation choose study design 100 patient group , assume drop-outs . The study recommend Regional ethic committee , Personvernombudet forskning ( Norsk samfunnsvitenskapelig datatjeneste ) Statens strålevern . 6 ) Main activity milestone : Cost-effectiveness analysis 2010 Inclusion surgery , 2010 Analyzing CT scan functional result , spring summer 2012 Publication 3 month follow-up , fall 2012 Analyzing RSA result 2012/2013 Publication RSA result 2012/2013 Register analysis , 2010/2012 7 ) Scientific impact : There many new expensive instrumentation implant market today . In order Norwegian hospital able offer high international standard treatment , need evaluate carefully choice make . To date , computer navigation knee replacement surgery well document recommended standard procedure Norwegian hospital . Earlier study lack report impact long term implant survival . This study unique use RSA predict long term outcome . It also large enough evaluate functional result morbidity . In addition , register analysis give u information publish . It important patient confident he/she receive best treatment available , important health care provider fund authority receive clear accurate information choose two different treatment , order gain benefit . 8 ) Dissemination project result : We publish result high impact international medical journal disseminate result colleague around world . Lectures presentation national international congress natural way publish result . An investigator education programme , PhD , incorporate project , include presentation poster national international congress . The project register international trial register , accord demand many journal publish .</detailed_description>
