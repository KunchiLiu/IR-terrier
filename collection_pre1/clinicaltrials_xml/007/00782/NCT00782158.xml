	<brief_summary>This study determine amount liver scar ( fibrosis ) liver damage people infect 1 ) hepatitis B virus ( HBV , virus infect liver ) ; 2 ) HIV ( virus cause AIDS ) ; 3 ) HBV HIV ; 4 ) neither HBV HIV . Liver fibrosis liver damage many cause , include alcohol , certain medicine , exposure contaminate food infection virus affect liver ( HBV ) . About 25 million people sub-Saharan Africa infect HIV 50 million chronic HBV , yet little information available many people infected virus medical implication co-infection . Participants Uganda Rakai Health Sciences Program ( RHSP ) Infectious Diseases Institute ( IDI ) clinic 18 year age old may eligible study . People enrol study come clinic least one visit may ask return yearly . During visit , participant undergo follow procedure : - Questionnaire short interview health quality life . - Physical examination blood draw . The blood test HBV factor may suggest liver disease . Blood drawn previous clinic visit study may also test . - Liver evaluation use FibroScan , medical device use elastic wave measure liver stiffness process similar ultrasound scanning . For test , subject lie flat back arm extend . The tip machine probe cover gel place skin rib level right lobe liver . The machine produce little tap skin sends wave check fast wave move . The speed wave indicate amount scar liver .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While around 25 million HIV-infected person sub-Saharan Africa , also estimate 50 million chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection . Yet data Africa prevalence clinical implication HIV/HBV co-infection sparse unavailable . The scale-up ' HIV treatment antiretroviral medication ( ARVs ) Africa , result substantial reduction morbidity mortality . In developed country , however , improve survival highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) associate notable increase mortality due liver disease among HIV-infected person . Also , person co-infected hepatitis virus significantly high liver-related toxicity ARVs compare person infect HIV alone . Our protocol investigate predictor liver disease among co-infected participant . The propose study directly address problem HIV/HBV co-infection examine association HBV viral marker development significant liver fibrosis ( defined transient elastography ) . In addition strengthen clinical research capacity Ugandan colleague , completion study aim provide need information understand complex interaction HBV HIV , project future burden liver disease relate HIV epidemic , clinical management HBV infection set co-infection HIV , optimize benefit mitigate potential deleterious consequence antiretroviral program Africa . Serological screening perform 11,000 subject order identify 2,400 subject recruit clinical protocol . All people choose participate study ask come clinic least 1 visit . If continuing funding obtain , participant may ask return additional yearly follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
