	<brief_summary>This study effect 3 oz almond add daily National Cholesterol Education Program Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes ( TLC ) diet improve endothelial function patient Coronary Artery Disease . The study seek determine effect mediate via increase Nitric Oxide synthesis reduction dyslipidemia systemic inflammation . Vascular reactivity assess via flow mediate dilation endothelium-independent hyperemic flow measure right brachial artery non-invasive 2-dimensional Doppler ultrasound . Serum collect analyzed biomarkers dyslipidemia , inflammation , endothelial function , vascular reactivity oxidative stress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study randomize , crossover , 6 week intervention trial design 6 week run TLC diet 6 week washout TLC diet control intervention period . Forty subject verify stable coronary artery disease enrol study . The control intervention involve maintain steady TLC diet without nut monitor counsel dietary assessment . The almond intervention involve consume 3 oz . almond per day adjust lipid intake remain isocaloric TLC diet alone . Again subject monitor counsel dietary assessment . At begin end intervention period subject test endothelial function use flow mediate dilation blood urine sample collect biochemical analysis marker inflammation , dyslipidemia , oxidative stress .</detailed_description>
