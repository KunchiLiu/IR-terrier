	<brief_title>Predictive Genetic Risk Assessment Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prospect personalize medicine heat debate Mayo Clinic interest across world . A point contention provision individual genetic risk assessment healthy patient , especially information predict risk common disease like diabetes , cancer , heart disease . While scientific debate continue , personal genetic test currently offer public commercial firm use `` direct-to-consumer '' ( DTC ) approach . At present , number private company offer service grow ( i.e . 23 , deCode genetics , etc. ) . Although many professional hope genetic risk information prove valuable near future , little understanding kind predictive risk assessment interpret perceived patient doctor . Due great attention give predictive genetic test popular press , one expect patient soon demand test part standard clinical practice . Yet , currently effective regulatory oversight guide clinician policy maker incorporate result predictive genetic test routine clinical use . In fact , appropriate clinical trial assess impact type test complete . Indeed , recent commentary New England Journal Medicine recommend test conduct context clinical trial . How protect human subject early stage development new technology classic dilemma translational research . For reason , develop `` proof-of-principle '' clinical trial Mayo Clinic study patient physician understand utilize predictive genetic risk assessment . A critical goal clinical trial understand individual patient doctor perceive respond genetic risk information largely uncertain . Our pilot study seek answer three fundamental question : How physicians deal uncertainty provide new technology predictive genetic risk assessment ? What hop patient regard significance predictive genetic testing ? And interpret result ? This proof-of-principle study investigate impact direct-to-consumer , predictive genetic testing provide sponsored Navigenics , Inc. , private company advertising predictive genetic test common disease condition . This study allow Mayo Clinic proactive research dynamic potential innovation health care . The proof-of-principle study describe herein design collect preliminary data inform development large clinical trial provide data application federal funding . Our study collaboration Navigenics , industry sponsor project . Navigenics use high density , genome microarray determine gene variants- , publish disease-association study , calculate relative risk patient target common disease . High density microarrays genome chip allow assessment one million single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) relatively low cost . The combination particular SNPs presume influence risk develop certain common disease show genome-wide association study publish peer-reviewed scientific medical literature . Navigenics use population-based association study ( study produce odds ratio develop disease give certain SNP ) estimate relative individual patient develop disease , approach use direct-to-consumer genetic testing company . They claim test role preventive medicine order `` Help people live healthy life . '' Our study allow u examine patient doctor respond utilize Navigenics ' risk assessment derive microarray technology publish genome-wide association study . The role information delivery patient physician , genetic counselor health care professional use predictive genetic risk assessment unclear . Its acceptance patient health care professional also study . Therefore , study seek compare perception genetic risk estimation obtain Navigenics ' test relative risk estimation obtain family history , current Mayo standard care . Our study design include two phase conduct 18 month . The first phase `` pre-pilot '' study take place 2008 . In phase one , conduct structure interview 20 Executive Health ( EH ) Program patient obtain disease risk assessment common disease obtain family history . In phase 2 , conduct quantitative phone survey 150 EH patient randomize two arm ( genetic test standard care ) . We also conduct follow qualitative interview 20 patient phase 2 . The study anticipate complete mid 2009 .</detailed_description>
