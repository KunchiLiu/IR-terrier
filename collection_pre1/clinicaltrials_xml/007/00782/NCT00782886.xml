	<brief_title>Evaluation Image-Guided Liver Surgical System Resection Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In automobile GPS , current position vehicle accurately localize `` registered '' onto electronic roadmap locate dashboard . As automobile move , position update roadmap . The driver use GPS guide determine vehicle head . This concept apply image-guided surgery , current surgical position instrument operate room register onto medical image patient acquire preoperatively . These image use guide surgeon accurate localization tumor surround anatomic structure . This clinical trial design determine effectiveness use image-guided technique treatment liver tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written informed consent must obtain . 2 . Patient must 18 year old . 3 . Patients recruit male nonpregnant , nonlactating female . Liver resection ablation could harmful unborn child , therefore recommended pregnancy . All consent patient childbearing potential advise use adequate birth control ( oral , implanted , barrier method ) , along sexual partner , consider liver tumor resection ablation one month follow surgery . 4 . Negative serum urine pregnancy test result screen woman childbearing potential ( applies patient without document menopause sterility ) . 5 . Patients enrol must candidate surgical liver resection liver cancer ( primary metastatic ) benign liver lesion ( hemangioma , Focal Nodular Hyperplasia , Adenoma ) . Liver cancer must present preoperative imaging study ( CT and/or MRI ) , applicable . 6 . Patient must schedule surgical treatment liver cancer require removal least one ( 1 ) anatomic segment . 1 . Any condition , judgment clinical investigator designee , might increase risk subject decrease chance obtain satisfactory data achieve objective study . 2 . Patients mental condition render unable understand inform consent nature , scope , possible consequence study . 3 . Patients require surgical intervention extend beyond liver , exception extension adjacent structure might allow unless liver primary focus surgery AND potential blood loss surgical site may jeopardize safety patient . There absolute rule adjacent structure would allow , thus prior approval must obtain Medical Monitor list extrahepatobiliary surgery . 4 . Patients hereditary hematologic/coagulation disorder unrelated liver disease . 5 . Patients cirrhosis liver classify Child 's B C. ( See Appendix A ) 6 . Use aspirin within 7 day prior surgery antiplatelet agent ( i.e. , Plavix ) within 10 day prior surgery nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication within 48 hour prior surgery . 7 . Patients thrombocytopenia ( platelet count 100,000 per ml , White Count 3.0 , Hemoglobin 10 great ) . 8 . Patients currently ( within last 30 day prior surgery ) participate another clinical trial investigational drug device . 9 . Patients undergo liver surgery result trauma . 10 . Patients undergo liver surgery purpose receive liver transplant . 11 . Patients undergo liver surgery single minor wedge resection surface liver . 12 . Patients establish renal insufficiency ( define creatinine great 2.5 mg/dl ) , condition require hemodialysis .</criteria>
