	<brief_summary>This phase II study Nilotinib patient advance GIST surgically remove . Patients candidate study tumor progress imatinib sunitinib intolerant drug . Patients may receive investigational therapy well . We test benefit nilotinib advance GIST look length time disease control well response disease drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nilotinib Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ( GIST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nilotinib oral drug . The dose 400 mg twice daily Patients evaluate every 8 week disease response . Blood work assess safety initially weekly , every 4 week . Physical exam perform initially weekly decrease every 4 week first month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients must histologically cytologically confirm GIST Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; = 20 millimeter ( mm ) conventional technique &gt; = 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients may receive prior chemotherapy radiation therapy . Patients must recover prior therapy least 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ; 2 week limited field palliative radiation ) must elapse since prior treatment . Patients must receive progressed imatinib sunitinib . Except nilotinib , patient may receive additional tyrosine kinase inhibitor additional targeted therapy . Age &gt; = 18 year . Life expectancy great 12 week . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; = 100,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 time Upper Limits Normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; = 2.5 X ULN OR &lt; = 5.0 X ULN consider due tumor Potassium , magnesium normal correct normal limit prior initiate drug Calcium , phosphorus normal correct normal limit prior initiate drug creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance 24 hour creatinine clearance &gt; = 50 mL/min ( calculation cockroft formula acceptable ) The effect Nilotinib develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . Men woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) , include female partner heterosexual bisexual patient , must agree use effective method contraception study three month follow termination study . Post menopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria Patients may receive investigational agent within 4 week . Prior concomitant malignancy ( relapse last 5 year require active treatment ) GIST exception previous concomitant basal cell skin cancer , previous cervical carcinoma situ Impaired cardiac function baseline , include one following : Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 45 % institutional Lower Limits Normal ( LLN ) range ( whichever high ) Complete leave bundle branch block Use ventricular pace cardiac pacemaker Congenital long QT syndrome family history long QT syndrome History presence significant ventricular atrial tachyarrhythmias Clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) QTc &gt; 450 msec screen ECG ( use QTcF formula ) . If QTc &gt; 450 msec electrolyte within normal range ( electrolyte correct patient rescreened QTc . Right bundle branch block plus leave anterior hemiblock , bifascicular block Myocardial infarction within 12 month prior Visit 1 Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g. , unstable angina , congestive heart failure uncontrolled hypertension ) Patients severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease opinion investigator could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol e.g . impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function , GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug , uncontrolled diabetes Use therapeutic coumarin derivative ( i.e . warfarin , acenoucumarol , phenprocoumon ) Use medication prolong QT interval CYP3A4 inhibitor treatment either safely discontinue switch different medication prior start study drug administration . Please see http : //www.torsades.org/medicalpros/druglists/printabledruglist.cfm comprehensive list agent prolong QT interval well Patients undergone major surgery &lt; = 2 week prior Visit 1 recover side effect surgery A history noncompliance medical regimen inability unwillingness return schedule visit , patient pregnant breast feeding , patient unwilling unable comply requirement protocol . Patient know chronic liver disease ( i.e. , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis ) . Patient known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection .</criteria>
