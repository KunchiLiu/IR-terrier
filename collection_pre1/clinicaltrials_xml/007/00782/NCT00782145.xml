	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate ability Web-based Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( HSCT- ) Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System ( HSCT-CHESS ) mitigate impact child 's HSCT health-related quality life , family functioning , knowledge , skill , process care accompany parent . Secondary - To explore potential mechanism action HSCT-CHESS improving outcome parent , term parental activation , social support and/or cop skill . - To explore impact HSCT-CHESS health-related quality life pediatric HSCT patient , report parent child . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) recipient ( age 2 months-18 year ) accompany parent ask complete baseline assessment battery start transplant conditioning ( 'run-in ' period ) . If either member participate dyad fail complete study measures* time period , dyad withdrawn study . The dyad randomize 1 2 intervention arm . NOTE : *Measures collect pediatric patient 5 year age baseline follow-up . - Arm I : Each dyad receive institution-specific usual care 6 month , typically include psychosocial support HSCT recipient individualize group education support accompany parent peri-transplant period . They also receive Web-based Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( HSCT- ) Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System ( HSCT-CHESS ) intervention 6 month . Accompanying parent also may identify companion receive access HSCT-CHESS Web site . The HSCT-CHESS Web site provide ready access accurate information resource pediatric HSCT , practical tip , organizational tool , supportive service use transplant process . While Web site design primarily use accompany parent , also include resource child adolescent HSCT recipient parent may choose share . In addition collect data later analysis , Web site track system allow tailor information support user , principally time post transplant . - Arm II : Each dyad receive institution-specific usual care 6 month describe arm I . Accompanying parent also receive book Blood Marrow Transplant Information Network ( BMT InfoNet ) . Each dyad complete quality-of-life assessment ( Child Health Ratings Inventory [ CHRIs ] -General CHRIs-HSCT ) day 45 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month CHRIS-General baseline .
