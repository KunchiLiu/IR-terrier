	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test safety tolerability experimental drug , Chemophase , combination recombinant human hyaluronidase , ( investigational synthetic enzyme also know rHuPH20 ) , mitomycin ( MMC ) treatment superficial bladder cancer instill intravesically immediately TURBT ( transurethral resection bladder tumor ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Immediate Post-Operative Intravesical Instillation Chemophase® Patients With Superficial Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients screen enrolled prior undergo standard care TURBT know suspected Stage Ta , T1 Tis bladder cancer histological grade require TURBT believe candidate IPOP intravesical chemotherapy regardless need intravesical therapy . Within 6 hour completion TURBT , patient administer single IPOP intravesical instillation Chemophase one-hour dwell time . At end one-hour dwell time , patient ask fully void , intravesical catheter leave place , bladder fully drain via catheter . Patients return 1 2 week post instillation follow visit safety cystoscopy day 85 ( per standard care ) . Safety tolerability assess physical examination , vital sign , cystoscopy , hematology ( CBC ) , adverse event reporting , measurement plasma level MMC .</detailed_description>
