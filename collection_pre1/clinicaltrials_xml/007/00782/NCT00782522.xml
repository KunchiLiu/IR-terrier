	<brief_summary>In first part study two new outcome measurement ( force reproducibility subacromial space ) test reproducibility . Therefore 30 healthy people assess . In second part study 60 patient randomly allocate two group . Group A ( n=30 ) perform traditional training program group B ( n=30 ) perform eccentric training program . Before onset training program , pain , function , maximal force , range motion , subacromial space force reproducibility assess . Both train program accomplish home . The first six week appointment therapist week explain , correct necessary , aggravate exercise . The next six week appointment diminish every two week . After 6 12 week train patient reassessed parameter .</brief_summary>
