	<brief_title>A Study Dopamine Type 2 ( D2 ) Receptor Occupancy Following Single Oral Dose OROS Paliperidone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , single-dose , open-label , Phase-1 Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) study 4 healthy volunteer , 2 men 2 woman . After screen , healthy eligible volunteer hospitalize study unit study Day 2 Day 4 . On Day 1 ( day hospitalization ) , volunteer enter study unit 5:00 p.m. 8:00 p.m. baseline prolactin blood sample sedation assessment . Each volunteer control magnetic resonance imaging ( screen ) 3 PET measurement use radioligand [ 11 ] C raclopride measure central D2 receptor occupancy putamen . Blood sample measure plasma concentration paliperidone collect immediately schedule time point dose administration Day 2 , immediately , halfway , immediately PET-2 PET-3 measurement . Serum prolactin level measure immediately several scheduled time point dose administration , immediately PET measurement . At scheduled time point , supine stand blood pressure , pulse , sensorium change , temperature , degree sedation record , volunteer question adverse event , evaluate extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) . Adverse event record follow throughout study . The rationale study design base previous PET study risperidone , indicate PET measurement D2 receptor occupancy single dose medication useful predict effective clinical dose range . Single oral dose ( 6 mg ) OROS paliperidone</detailed_description>
