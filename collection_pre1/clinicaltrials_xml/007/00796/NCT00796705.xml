	<brief_title>Switching Anti-TNF-Alpha Agents Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over past 10 year , advancement biotechnology revolutionize Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) therapeutics biologically-derived immunomodulating compound . Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) alpha inhibitor constitute large class new biologic therapy . The purpose study determine effectiveness switch alternative TNF-alpha inhibitor comparison continue treatment exist TNF-alpha inhibitor adult suffer RA inadequate clinical response study drug etanercept adalimumab . This study last approximately 16 week . Participants randomize two arm receive injection per week 12 week . Participants adalimumab arm receive alternate subcutaneous adalimumab adalimumab placebo injection . Participants etanercept arm receive subcutaneous etanercept injection . This study consist thirteen study visit randomization . Study visit occur weekly basis 12 week prior follow-up visit Week 16 . A vital sign measurement adverse event assessment occur visit . A physical exam , assessment tender swollen joint , medication assessment , blood collection occur Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis Rheumatoid Arthritis Current treatment either etanercept adalimumab least 12 week prior randomization Disease Activity Score ( DAS ) Creactive Protein ( CRP ) 28 â‰¥ 4.4 Treatment concomitant DiseaseModifying AntiRheumatic Drugs ( DMARDs ) permit require described : 1 . Methotrexate maximum dose 25 mg per o ( PO ) , intramuscular ( IM ) , SQ weekly . 2 . Leflunomide maximum dose 20 mg PO daily . 3 . Sulfasalazine maximum dose 1,500 mg PO twice daily . 4 . Hydroxychloroquine maximum dose 400 mg PO daily . If take DMARD ( ) , subject must stable dos least 12 week prior randomization . If treat prednisone ( equivalent corticosteroid ) , stable dose &lt; = 10 mg/day 28 day prior randomization . Agree use appropriate form contraception . More information criterion find protocol . Diagnosis another autoimmune disease likely require immunosuppression . More information criterion find protocol . Failing treatment etanercept previously treat adalimumab Failing treatment adalimumab previously treat etanercept Intraarticular injection within 4 week prior randomization Concomitant use DMARDs describe Inclusion Criteria within 12 week randomization . Concurrent use biologic agent etanercept adalimumab Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy DiseaseModifying AntiRheumatic Drugs ( DMARDs ) , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , corticosteroid specify protocol Presence open leg ulcer Chronic persistent infection may worsen immunosuppressive treatment . More information criterion find protocol . Active infection severe infection require hospitalization treatment intravenous antibiotic , antiviral , antifungal within 30 day prior randomization History positive Purified Protein Derivative ( PPD ) chest xray finding indicative prior tuberculosis infection Any medical condition treatment , opinion investigator , would put subject risk participation study History malignancy . More information criterion find protocol . Certain abnormal laboratory value . More information criterion find protocol . Investigational biological chemical agent within 4 week prior randomization . History drug alcohol abuse within year prior randomization Treatment natalizumab , rituximab , another Bcell deplete therapy within year prior randomization Treatment infliximab , abatacept , tocilizumab , golimumab , certolizumab pegol within 12 week prior randomization . Known allergy hypersensitivity study product Any psychiatric disorder prevents participant provide informed consent Inability follow protocol instruction Pregnant breastfeeding</criteria>
