	<detailed_description>Many recent study suggest overlap pain emotion-related neurophysiological process . Several modern pain theory also advocate pain consider complex sensory emotional experience , rather isolated sensory event . In accordance theory , reasonable expect intervention CBT , teach patient understand control emotional sensory aspect pain , could alter brain 's response pain emotionally provocative stimulus , consequently , change underlie neural circuitry . To date , publish study explore neurobiological effect psychotherapeutic approach , CBT , chronic pain . A previous pilot study show exaggerated amygdala response negative emotional stimulus chronic pain patient normalize 12 week group CBT , suggest CBT may affect least emotional component pain process . Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , create three-dimensional picture brain , study determine follow : ( 1 ) whether CBT treatment change function brain neural circuitry response acute noxious physical stimulus fearful emotional stimulus ; ( 2 ) alter activation brain area associate attentional , affective , sensory aspect chronic pain relate measurable improvement someone 's clinical response group CBT . Directly measure effect CBT brain function could ultimately improve clinical decision make contribute development individualize treatment patient chronic pain . Participants randomly assign receive 12 week either CBT pain education , act attention control condition . Each CBT session last 90 minute teach participant specific skill well cope chronic pain . These skill include breathe exercise , distraction , relaxation technique . Each weekly pain education session , also last 90 minute , structure group discussion lead health care counselor . During session , participant receive information nature chronic back pain , talk treatment option , learn exercise stretch technique maintain strength flexibility , learn protect back . Every participant undergo two fMRI examination : one treatment one treatment .</detailed_description>
