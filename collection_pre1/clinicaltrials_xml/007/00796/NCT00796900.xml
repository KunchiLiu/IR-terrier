	<brief_title>Dantrolene Treatment Hyperthermia Subarachnoidal Hemorrhage ( SAH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Fever episodes occur 50 % patient admit ICU subarachnoidal hemorrhage , central nervous system infection , seizure control , hemorrhagic stroke , close head injury despite antibiotic antipyretic therapy . The exact mechanism hyperthermia-induced brain injury know ; however , various process may involve . For example , hyperthermia might increase release excitatory neurotransmitter trigger abundant amount oxygen free radical . Hyperthermia may also aggravate blood-brain barrier disruption , impair cytoskeletal proteolysis , and/or enhance inhibition enzymatic protein kinase , , turn , would impair recovery energy metabolism . Antipyretics effective conventional fever , less useful various central hyperthermia syndrome , especially result stroke , SAH , head injury . Even aggressive cool usually insufficient patient fever unable overcome high metabolic rate patient . Likewise , physical cooling counteract thermoregulatory defense activate maintain hyperthermia . In non-sedated individual , active cooling increase metabolic stress without decrease core temperature . To date , treatment centrally mediate hyperthermia remain unsatisfying . Dantrolene available since 1975 specific treatment acute malignant hyperthermia crisis . However , dantrolene increasingly used emergency treatment life-threatening hyperthermia unresponsive conventional treatment . For example , drug use success acute treatment life-threatening hyperthermia result neuroleptic malignant syndrome hyperthermia associate overdose various drug . It also use treatment various type hyperthermia . Efficacy case appear base non-specific action drug ; extent dantrolene effective , action must conform law thermodynamics . Dantrolene must , therefore , reduce metabolic heat production , augment systemic heat loss , alter normal distribution heat within body . In word , dantrolene must reverse abnormal ( ineffective ) thermoregulatory control initiate hyperthermic crisis . Item : We propose test hypothesis dantrolene reduce centrally mediate fever patient subarachnoidal hemorrhage . Specifically , test hypothesis dantrolene decrease magnitude duration hyperthermia . The study restrict neurosurgical patient sustain fever ( ≥38ºC hour ) without identifiable infectious cause subarachnoidal hemorrhage age 18 80 year . There limitation enrollment patient breathe spontaneously ventilator dependant .</detailed_description>
