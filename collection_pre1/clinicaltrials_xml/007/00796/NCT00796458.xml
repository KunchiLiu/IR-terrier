	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Androgen ablation therapy may lessen amount androgen make body . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether give androgen ablation therapy together docetaxel effective give androgen ablation therapy alone treat patient advanced prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study androgen ablation docetaxel see well work compare androgen ablation alone treat patient advanced prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Androgen Ablation With Without Docetaxel Treating Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare 2-year progression-free survival rate ( biological progression and/or clinical progression ) patient advanced prostate cancer treat androgen ablation v without docetaxel . Secondary - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare time treatment failure patient treat regimen . - Compare toxicity profile regimens patient . - Compare PSA response rate patient treat regimen . - Compare response rate patient measurable disease treat regimen . - Compare percentage patient undergo PSA normalization . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare efficacy regimens control bone pain patient . - Compare change chromogranin A level patient treat regimen . - Compare total cost care patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue ( LHRH-A ) therapy 6 month . Patients also receive antiandrogen therapy first 5 week LHRH-A therapy . After 6 month LHRH-A therapy , patient PSA response randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients continue receive LHRH-A therapy disease progression . - Arm II : Patients receive LHRH-A therapy arm I . Patients also receive docetaxel IV day 1 . Treatment docetaxel repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete questionnaire treatment ass bone pain . Quality life also assess . After completion study therapy , patient follow ≥ 2 year .</detailed_description>
