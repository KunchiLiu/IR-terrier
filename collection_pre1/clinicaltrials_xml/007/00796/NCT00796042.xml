	<brief_summary>People spinal cord injury posses many factor increase risk develop pressure ulcer . Not surprisingly , approximately 82 % person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) experience pressure ulcer sometime life . Earlier guideline assessment treatment pressure ulcer produce RNAO 20027 recommend `` client pressure ulcer seat surface avoid sit . '' Unfortunately , recommendation fuel long standing view people pressure ulcer stop use wheelchair return bed . The strength evidence assign recommendation Level=C reflect paucity research evidence support common practice . Not benefit bed rest healing remain demonstrate , mount evidence bed rest harmful person 's overall health well . Bed rest show strongly associate complication body system include respiratory , cardiovascular , musculoskeletal , cerebrovascular , gastrointestinal , genital-urinary . Psychosocial complication cognitive impact also well document . Without evidence dispel myth `` bed rest best '' difficult change practice avoid many secondary complication . This study pilot study 1 ) determine whether pressure ulcer heal fast individual SCI receive individualize community-based , pressure management mobility program compare similar group assign usual care ( bed rest ) , 2 ) determine strength association intervention ( pressure/mobility bedrest ) wound healing , motor performance/independence quality life adjust motivation regain independence , degree caregiver burden , compliance intervention , 3 ) determine whether individual SCI participate pressure/mobility management program experience few secondary complication participate , 4 ) determine cost-effectiveness provide time-efficient , pressure management mobility program compare bed rest .</brief_summary>

Specific Objectives 1 . To determine whether pressure ulcer heal fast individual SCI receive individualize community-based , pressure management mobility program compare similar group assign usual care ( bed rest ) . 2 . To determine strength association intervention ( pressure/mobility bedrest ) wound healing , motor performance/independence quality life adjust motivation regain independence , degree caregiver burden , compliance intervention . 3 . To determine whether individual SCI participate pressure/mobility management program experience few secondary complication participate 4 . To determine cost-effectiveness provide time-efficient , pressure management mobility program compare bed rest . 5 . To formally evaluate ability successfully recruit eligible patient full study . 6 . To determine barrier facilitator successful implementation pressure management mobility program perspective client , caregiver , health care provider . 7 . To use experience individualize pressure management mobility program develop preceptorship/mentorship train program community-based pressure/mobility management transfer region Ontario distance education . Study Design : This pilot study double-blind , parallel group , randomize control cross-over design conduct two centre 1.5 year period . Rigorous pilot data ensure intervention sufficient potential warrant investigation , determine whether protocol feasible . As , method data collection strategy lay protocol meant mimic full trial . Sample population We enroll twenty individual SCI live two site ( Toronto ( n=10 ) London ( n=10 ) ) Stage II IV pressure ulcer ( ) meet eligibility criterion . Screening assessment : A research assistant contact volunteer consent participate study ass subject 's willingness undergo medical wound assessment determine study eligibility . She/he collect , information SCI injury , demographic , current level activity , wheelchair use , wound history . This entail phone interview home assessment research assistant schedule clinic visit ass eligibility . For subject interested learning study , research assistant schedule clinic visit ass eligibility . Wound Assessment : We arrange transportation wound management centre subject 's eligibility study participation ( see Inclusion/Exclusion criterion ) determine . The subject 's current medical status pressure sore ( ) assess research personnel include qualify wound care specialist she/he record detail wound history , determine wound extent severity , assess likelihood wound heal 8 month study period . As part medical screen , blood sample drawn wound swab obtain analyzed key determinant heal ( metabolic disorder , anemia , nutritional deficiency , infection ) . From assessment , develop treatment plan optimize wound environment , provide nutritional supplementation , modify factor interfere healing . Assignment subject study group : Following wound assessment , randomize ten eligible subject study centre ( London Toronto ) meet eligibility criterion use Zelen method whereby randomization treatment group occur prior subject consent participation . Those subject allocate intervention group ask consent participation randomize trial compare usual care pressure management mobility program . They inform randomize receive pressure management mobility program . Those subject allocate usual care ask consent participate long-term prospective natural history study document effect bed rest individual SCI pressure wound . This method randomization reduce considerable risk produce biased estimate effect treatment since patient assign usual care likely feel study participant receive good care ( despite lack evidence support notion ) . This method blind patient especially important trial subjective self-report outcome measure . Using data obtain assessment wound centre , randomization scheme stratify accord two key determinant heal ; wind severity ( Stage pressure ulcer II , III , IV ) ; 2 ) presence absence 2 abnormal blood value ensure potential confounding affect wound heal equally disperse treatment group . Randomization take place use 24-hour web-based randomization system Fowler Kennedy Methods Centre . The computer provide caller group allocation usual care pressure management mobility program . Group 1 : Usual Care : Subjects randomize usual care encourage implement standard wound care protocol consistent National ( CAWC ) Provincial ( RNAO ) best practice guideline treatment pressure ulcer . This wound care program customize subject 's need base result assessment perform wound care specialist . It address medical , psychological , nutritional factor interfere wound heal optimize wound environment . A registered dietitian review blood value associate nutritional status make recommendation dietary change . Wherever possible , implementation wound care program coordinate subject ' current health care team appropriate referral home care agency specialist initiate need . Subjects assign group continue current level activity ( bed rest ) . For purpose study define bed rest significant reduction patient 's normal activity level involve 12 hour per day bed . Any equipment service obtain usual provider agency document part associate wait time . All study subject volunteer participate screen process receive write report summarize finding assessment . Included report explanation factor interfere heal recommendation modify home wound environment promote wound closure limit current future problem skin integrity . Provided study subject agreement , relay information health care professional administrator involve subject 's circle care . Group 2 : Individualized , Community-based , Pressure management Mobility program : Subjects allocate group provide customize wound care program usual care group pressure management mobility program customize individual 's need . This program base depth home environmental assessment ( ) perform registered Occupational ( OT ) and/or Physical Therapist ( PT ) train part research study implement within one month randomization . Pressure Management program : A qualified OT PT examine subject in-use surface include bed , toilet/commode , shower chair , conduct detail wheelchair assessment include pressure mapping technology ( X3 Pressure Mapping System , ( Xsensor Technology Corporation , Calgary , Canada ) observe transfer surface identify source friction shear , strength balance deficit . The subject ask record activity level complete diary record daily activity three day period include surface use , duration surface number type transfer complete throughout day . From detailed 1-2 hour home assessment , OT/PT apprentice identify equipment service require manage pressure , improve mobility , reduce friction shear . Through collaboration sponsor company 's ( Waverly Glen , Shoppers Home Health , The Roho Group ) . This program might include rental purchase installation necessary equipment supply , modification exist equipment , follow provide require re-adjustments . Mobility Program : We contract service qualify Physical Therapist ass strength , balance , range motion , functional independence transfer ADLs . The subject ask perform activity classify current level functional independence use FIM motor scale ( FIM ) . Based result assessment she/he develop mobility program optimize functional independence improve strength balance require safe effective transfer bed mobility include educate individual caregiver move minimal injury skin . Depending complexity mobility program , delivery customized mobility program may involve train exist , community-based Personal Support Workers ( PSW ) aid assist transfer , supervise strengthen balance exercise regular basis . Training `` OT/PT Apprentices '' use Distance education method : technology A distance education model use build knowledge , skills behaviours pressure management rehabilitation motor function need community base therapist - call `` OT/PT Apprentices '' . Two therapist ( OT PT ) per site select trained implement individualize pressure management program people SCI live community . They first attend 2 day workshop provide L Norton P Houghton . Information learn session reinforce use preceptorship/mentorship model together hands-on experience subject enrol research study . This begin joint home visit Norton and/or Houghton directly supervise assessment . Subsequently , OT/PT apprentice perform home assessment independently relay finding ( pressure map , room dimension , video clip subject transfer ) electronically . Norton Houghton also available mobile phone question arise assessment . Computer base distance learn technology ( WebCT ) use access key article &amp; resource , participate asynchronous synchronous discussion group instructor ( Houghton &amp; Norton ) Apprentices ( n=4 OT PTs ) . This form eductation know help foster clinical reason skills22-24 need problem solve many roadblock anticipate program implementation . This education program modify improve throughout study accordance therapist feedback need identify inform sixth seventh objective . Data &amp; Statistical Analysis Primary Objective 1 - Wound Healing : We calculate percentage reduction wound surface area subject subtract initial wound surface area surface area measure primary endpoint - 5 month post randomization -following 3 month pressure management mobility program ( intervention group ) bed rest ( usual care group ) . We calculate mean percentage reduction wound surface treatment group determine whether difference group statistically significant use t-test . Further , use analysis co-variance ( baseline wound surface area enter covariate , wind surface area 5 month dependent variable treatment group independent variable ) determine whether statistically significant difference healing pressure ulcer individual receive pressure management mobility program compare similar group bed rest , control baseline surface area . Objective 2 - Motor Function Quality Life : Similar analysis described , use analysis co-variance ( baseline measurement enter covariate , post-randomization ( 5 month ) measure dependent variable treatment group independent variable ) determine whether statistically significant difference quality life ( SF-12 , Cardiff Wound Impact Questionnaire ) individual receive pressure management mobility program compare similar group bed rest , control baseline score . We produce plot express change quality life function time ass whether trajectory change different group use repeat measure analysis covariance . As pilot study , expect underpowered make statistical conclusion regard size treatment effect confidence . However , important between-groups difference ( 20 % minimally important difference ( MID ) ) contain within 95 % confidence interval around mean difference group , conclude large study warrant . We provide proportion individual group achieve goal lay COPM baseline , calculate odds obtain desired goal pressure management/mobility program compare usual care ass whether difference proportion significant use Fisher 's Exact Test . As pilot study , study underpowered confidently examine strength association motivation , caregiver burden compliance between-group difference . Thus , conduct exploratory analysis use univariate regression method provide preliminary estimate magnitude association formulate inform priori hypothesis relationship outcomes multiple potential predictor variable sufficient power test formally part full study . Objective 3 - Secondary Complications We report proportion patient experience adverse event group . Adverse event consider condition know commonly occur bed rest . Objective 4 - Cost Effectiveness : We conduct economic analysis compare usual care pressure management/mobility program term incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year ( QALY ) gain Ministry Health societal perspective . The time horizon economic evaluation 8 month . To determine 8 month direct indirect cost associate alternative , resource utilization , productivity loss , informal care pocket expenditure collect baseline month 2 , 5 , 8 value use public private source ( e.g . Ontario Schedule Benefits Physician Services , manufacturer ) . In order calculate QALYs , utility derive EQ-5D questionnaire weight time spend health state . Regression analysis use calculate QALYs adjust potential difference baseline utility value 2 group . Objective 5 Subject Recruitment : To inform fifth objective , report number eligible patient source calculate proportion eligible patient willing participate study . Objectives 6 7 Experiences : We review diary subject , caregiver , therapist optimize streamline delivery program . Utilization method centre remote , web-based , data management system inform feedback research personnel . The distance education program modify improve throughout study accordance `` OT/PT apprentice '' suggestion need .</detailed_description>
