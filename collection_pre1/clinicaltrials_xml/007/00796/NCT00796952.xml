	<detailed_description>Swallowing deficit result oropharyngeal cancer ablative therapy use control disease often devastating functional feeding outcome patient . Most patient experience degree dysphagia along nutritional decline . In particular , swallow outcome patient treat external beam radiation suggest poor patient treat surgical intervention alone . It also postulate formation radiation-induced fibrotic tissue , along acute radiation effect ( edema , mucositis , xerostomia ) may act collectively promote muscular disuse atrophy , note decline swallow function . We therefore suggest program swallowing exercise may help facilitate maintain muscle function oral cavity pharynx radiotherapy , thus preserve support swallow function patient . This study follow randomize controlled trial design . Patients confirm head / neck cancer identify plan radiotherapy undergo baseline evaluation include clinical instrumental swallowing assessment , nutritional examination , MRI prior CRT . Subjects randomize one three intervention arm represent control , placebo intervention group . Patients treat 6 week progress reassess 6 month . Outcome assessment complete blinded observer . Primary outcome include ; I ) Oropharyngeal active muscle volume , signal intensity , tissue composition time identify T2 weight MRI , II ) Level functional swallowing ability , III ) Patient perception swallow function quality life.The result study provide information efficacy ( lack efficacy ) isometric / isotonic exercise maintenance swallow function post radiotherapy Head /Neck cancer .</detailed_description>
