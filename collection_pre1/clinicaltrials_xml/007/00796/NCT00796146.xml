	<brief_title>Establish Characterize Acute HIV Infection Cohort High Risk Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study establish acute infection cohort predominantly non-subtype B . Description early event HIV infection critical HIV vaccine development understand HIV-1 immunopathogenesis . The ability establish cohort identify individual acute HIV-1 infection would provide basis future hypothesis-driven proposal . Subjects recruit TRCARC . Subjects seek VCT ask provide contact information . Blood sample , either plasma whole blood collect filter paper ( dried blood spot , DBS ) screen acute HIV infection pool individual NAT non-reactive screening EIA capable detect HIV antibody antigen ( 4th generation sensitive EIA ) . Additionally , 4th generation reactive sample screen non-IgM sensitive EIA capable detect HIV antibody ( less sensitive EIA ) within 1-2 day sample collection . Those find acute HIV infection ask enroll cohort study . These acute HIV-infected participant follow prospectively week 0 , day 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , every 12 week end study ( maximum 192 week follow ) . Subjects receive blood test CD4 , HIV RNA , ALT , creatinine lipid , urinalysis . Subjects ask complete questionnaire HIV risk behavior . Archiving plasma PBMC future immunologic virologic test perform . Optional study procedure include 1 ) collection genital secretion 2 ) collection cerebrospinal fluid 3 ) brain MRI/MRS without gadolinium 4 ) sample gut-associated lymphoid tissue colon biopsy 5 ) genetic test 6 ) track offer VCT sexual contact acute HIV-infected subject . Subjects encourage hospitalize first 3-7 day post-procedural observation ease follow .</detailed_description>
