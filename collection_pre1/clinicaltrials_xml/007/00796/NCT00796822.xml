	<brief_summary>People infect HIV great risk develop cardiovascular disease people infect HIV . This may due increase inflammation bring either HIV infection use antiretroviral medication treat HIV infection . This study evaluate anti-inflammatory drug , pentoxifylline , determine whether improves blood vessel function reduces inflammation people infect HIV currently receive antiretroviral medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Effectiveness Pentoxifylline Improving Blood Vessel Function HIV-infected People Not Receiving Antiretroviral Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People infected HIV increase risk cardiovascular disease , lead cause death HIV . The increase cardiovascular disease think link use several type antiretroviral medication use treat HIV infection . These medication show cause insulin resistance dyslipidemia , high cholesterol levels—conditions lead atherosclerosis , build-up plaque within artery , ultimately cardiovascular disease . However , new research emerge suggest people infect HIV receive antiretroviral medication may also increase risk cardiovascular disease result increase endothelial dysfunction . This condition , involve malfunction thin layer cell line interior surface blood vessel , lead atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease . Pentoxifylline medication currently use reduce leg pain people blockage blood vessel legs . Previous research show pentoxifylline may reduce inflammation improve blood vessel function people infect HIV , research need confirm benefit . The purpose study determine whether pentoxifylline reduces inflammation improve endothelial function HIV-infected people receive antiretroviral medication . This study enroll HIV-infected people currently receive antiretroviral medication . At baseline study visit , participant undergo medical history review ; physical examination ; measurement blood pressure , heart rate , height , weight , waist , hip ; blood urine collection . An ultrasound imaging test arm measure blood vessel function . Participants randomly assign receive either pentoxifylline placebo three time day 8 week . At study visit Weeks 4 8 , participant undergo repeat baseline measurement .</detailed_description>
