	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Radiation Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temsirolimus demonstrate anti-proliferative anti-angiogenic activity multiple epithelial cancer , well-tolerated , non-overlapping toxicity radiation , show potentiate effect radiation vitro . Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer cure minority patient concurrent chemoradiation newer agent need . In study temsirolimus study combination radiation phase I set establish safety .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis NSCLC . Patients must indication thoracic radiation . Because patient receive radiation therapy thoracic mass , must radiographically measurable disease participate . Patients may candidate definitive chemoradiation curative intent . Prior treatment lung cancer ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery ) allow complete least 4 week prior treatment related toxicity resolve . At least 18 year age . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal The effect temsirolimus develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients prior treatment temsirolimus . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis . Known brain metastasis allow asymptomatic previously treat . Patients may receive enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ; e.g. , phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital ) CYP3A4 inducer rifampin St. John 's wort , may decrease temsirolimus level . A partial list agent interact cytochrome P450 ( CYP3A ) find Appendix B . Use agent potently inhibit CYP3A ( hence may raise temsirolimus level ) , ketoconazole , discourage , specifically prohibit . Temsirolimus inhibit CYP2D6 , may decrease metabolism ( increase drug level ) drug substrates CYP2D6 , codeine . The appropriateness use agent leave physician discretion . A list drug may potential interaction CYP2D6 find Appendix B . If doubt eligibility base concomitant medication , Principal Investigator contact . All concomitant medication must record . Patients know hypersensitivity reaction macrolide antibiotic ( erythromycin , clarithromycin , azithromycin ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Known HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients receive prior thoracic radiation therapy direct tumor volume treat radiotherapy protocol .</criteria>
