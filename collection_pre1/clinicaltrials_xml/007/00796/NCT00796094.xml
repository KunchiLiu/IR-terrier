	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate potential importance tissue elasticity assessment soft tissue include muscle , tendon ligament soft tissue structure . The evaluation tissue elasticity ( easily stretch moveable ) may assist assessment various soft tissue structure , fatty atrophy muscle , tendon/ligamentous injury heal soft tissue structure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Soft Tissues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study recruit male females 18 year age older present department clinically indicate ultrasound superficial soft tissue abnormality prior follow MRI / CT assessment order clinical purpose . The elasticity property tissue depend molecular building block organization block . Injuries , disease etc know associate change tissue elasticity . Little research do potential sonoelastographic ( elasticity ultrasound image ) assessment normal , injured healing muscle , tendon ligament . Elasticity change muscle , ligament tendon follow injury may implication choice treatment help determine length time need heal injury . Stiffness/elasticity tissue assess mechanical excitation measurement resultant tissue motion . Reconstruction elastic deformability ( strain image ) real time ultrasound know sonoelastography . Elasticity ultrasound image performed area evaluate clinically .</detailed_description>
