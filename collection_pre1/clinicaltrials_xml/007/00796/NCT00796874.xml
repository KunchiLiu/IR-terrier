	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sometimes prostate cancer may need treatment progress . In case , active surveillance may sufficient . Diagnostic procedure , magnetic resonance imaging , may less invasive method find prostate cancer progress . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well magnetic resonance imaging work detect cancer progression patient early-stage prostate cancer undergo active surveillance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Detecting Cancer Progression Patients With Early Stage Prostate Cancer Undergoing Active Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine MRI parameter ( initial volume , number location image abnormality , MR spectroscopy ) improve ability stratify cancer progression risk patient undergo active surveillance early-stage prostate cancer . Secondary - Determine change non-invasive MRI , validate MRI-guided biopsy , accurately detect progression prostate cancer . OUTLINE : Patients undergo prostate MRI scan MRI-guided biopsy suspicious lesion baseline . Patients undergo conventional anatomic imaging follow research biological imaging test ( e.g. , magnetic resonance spectroscopic image and/or dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ) . MRI repeat 6 month , 1 year , annually initiation definitive therapy total 5 year . Tissue biopsy MRI guidance do baseline annually clinically indicate base change rectal exam , PSA , maybe do base change MR imaging ( i.e. , new MR lesion significant change [ &gt; 25 % increase ] size MR lesion ) . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study PSA test .</detailed_description>
