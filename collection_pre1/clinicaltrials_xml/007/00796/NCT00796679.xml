	<brief_title>Oral Paricalcitol Stage 3 - 5 Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause mortality morbidity patient chronic kidney disease . According previous study , 15.6 % patient begin dialysis therapy normal echocardiogram , leave ventricular hypertrophy , leave ventricular dilatation systolic dysfunction occur 40.7 % , 28 % 15.6 % patient , respectively . In addition , patient accelerate risk develop atherosclerosis . The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative guideline recently raise concern high prevalence vitamin D deficiency chronic kidney disease patient yet require dialysis treatment . In addition , recent data suggest vitamin D deficiency important predictor mortality end-stage renal disease patient . Furthermore , hemodialysis patient treat paricalcitol , selective vitamin D receptor activator , show significantly low risk cardiovascular death receive vitamin D therapy . A number study also show positive benefit vitamin D receptor activator treatment regression leave ventricular hypertrophy dialysis patient . However , far data patient stage 3 4 chronic kidney disease high prevalence vitamin D deficiency cardiac hypertrophy report .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient stage 3 5 chronic kidney disease ( , eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min per 1.73m2 ) diagnose 2 month expect start dialysis within next 12 month , Patient screen echocardiography show evidence leave ventricular hypertrophy Patient receive vitamin D therapy previous 4 week For entry Treatment Phase , subject must : screening iPTH &gt; = 55 pg/ml 5.8pmol/L ( determine Nichols secondgeneration assay similar assay ) serum calcium &lt; 10.2 mg/dL ( 2.55 mmol/L ) serum phosphorus = &lt; 5.2mg/dL ( 1.68mmol/L ) Ca*P product &lt; 54 mg2/dL2 ( 4.36mmol2/L2 ) If female , subject either childbearing potential , defined postmenopausal least 1 year surgically sterile ( bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , hysterectomy ) , childbearing potential practice birth control measure . Patients provide inform consent study Patient history allergic reaction significant sensitivity vitamin D vitamin D related compound . Patient history renal stone Patient current malignancy Patients clinically significant gastrointestinal disease liver disease Patient acute renal failure recent three month Patient history drug alcohol abuse within six month prior screen phase Patient know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive . Patient evidence poor compliance diet medication . Patient currently receive medication may affect calcium , phosphorus metabolism calcitonin , cinacalcet , bisphophonates vitamin D compound ( study drug ) , drug may affect calcium bone metabolism , females stable estrogen and/or progestin therapy . Patients active granulomatous disease Patient pregnancy Patients currently receive glucocorticoid steroid immunosuppressive treatment administer glucocorticoid immunosuppressive treatment 14 day within recent 6 month . Patients contraindication MRI examination</criteria>
