	<brief_summary>Genetic research provide exciting breakthrough neuroscience cognitive science . Partially genetically determine cognitive impairment describe people COMT , 5HT6 , BDNF ( Swillen et al. , 2000 ; Moss et al. , 1999 , Henry et al. , 2002 , Bilder et al. , 2002 ) biological systemic pathway candidate gene . Selective inhibitor COMT prove improve cognitive function animal patient Parkinson 's disease ( Carlsson , et al , 2000 ) . Recent study suggest variation COMT activity might neurobiological effect specific prefrontal cortex ; COMT ( Val ) allele high activity impairs task prefrontal cognition people schizophrenia ( Egan et al. , 2001 ) high load COMT ( Met ) allele associate well cognitive performance attention process speed people chronic schizophrenia ( Bilder et al. , 2002 ) . Moreover , prefrontal dopamine level increase COMT knockout mouse model ( Gogos et al. , 1998 ) . This suggest people heterozygosis COMT , dopamine level could abnormal . Thus , variation COMT expression could also affect performance prefrontal cognitive task . In previous study , find neuropsychological profile student COMT ( Met ) allele good object perception , problem solve planning , abstract social thinking ( Henry et al. , 2002 ) . 5-HT6 inhibitor report raise extracellular acetylcholine level cortex hippocampus ( Dawson et al. , 2001 Riemer et al. , 2003 ) . Acetylcholine release hippocampal cortical region know important memory acquisition retention , several group demonstrate 5-HT6 blockade overcome scopolamine-induced amnesia . We hypothesize variation COMT 5-HT6 associate genotype cause poor/better performance cognitive task . With aim establish possible correlation candidate gene ( COMT , 5HT6 , BDNF biological systemic pathway candidate gene . etc ) cognitive ability , provide u understanding factor extent affect student ' thinking , develop appropriate teaching model strategy assist student learn . It seem timely , therefore , consider might implement increase understand brain development brain function explore educational question .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In past decade , number study concern connection neuroscience cognitive science grow dramatically . The finding might inform u learner find good way learn . However , proven difficult apply finding real classroom ( Bruer , 1997 ; Goswami , 2006 ) . This mainly learn behavior require interaction among various cognitive ability , yet neuroscience-related research stress cognitive ability microstructure alone . In word , neuroscience research often focus microstructure cell , cognitive research focus systematic integration . Generally speak , single-neuron cell insufficient behavior development . Based statement , `` whole equal sum every single part '' , simply examine microstructure lead understand behavior produce cell assembly/synergy . The current neuroscience technology detect activity two cell simultaneously still progress , issue cell work harmoniously seriously consider recently . Clearly , educator study learn level cell . A successful learning depend curriculum , teacher , context provide classroom family , context school wider community . All factor synergistically interact characteristic individual brain . For example , child high level monoamine oxidise A experience maltreatment adverse family environment seem protected develop antisocial behavior ( Caspi , et al. , 2002 ) , possibly via moderate effect neural response stress . Diet also report affect brain . A child whose diet poor able respond excellent teach way child whose brain well-nourished . It already possible study effect various medication cognitive function . Methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) show improve stimulus recognition child ADHD ( Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ) ( Seifert , et al. , 2003 ) . Neuroimaging technique also offer potential study effect different diet , food additive potential toxin educational performance . In opinion , apply neuroscience finding actual classroom beneficial student learn . It value study connection neuroscience education extend related topic , practical mechanism , result meaningful integration . Therefore , explore behavior-cognitive-neuron-gene system ( BCNG system ) ( Fig 1 ) develop science educational theory neuroscience-related study main objective long-term goad result future research . The BCNG system include two main category , namely `` science education '' `` neuroscience '' . Currently , science education research include previous endeavor emphasize cognitive ability affect learner ' academic achievement performance ( example , Wang , Chang , &amp; Li , publish online ; Chang et . al. , 2006 ) neuroscience stress relationships individual 's cognitive ability neurophysiology/ biochemistry mechanism . Currently , ten aspect cognitive ability , include intelligence , attention , memory , linguistic ability , spatial ordering , high order cognition , order system , action system , social interaction system emotion . These aspect divide sub-topics . Changes cognitive ability cause innate , genetic inherence learn ability acquire ability enforce learning . However , researcher yet clearly understood extent innate acquire factor influence individual 's cognitive ability . In learn process , student perform well academic student due poor cognitive ability affect willingness learn . In word , low cognitive ability affect student ' willingness learn . Deficiencies linguistic system ( include defect listen , speaking , read write ) , element affect language skill ( contain disability phoneme , morpheme syntax ) , disagreements activity muscle ( cause messy write ) make student consider clumsy indolent tease peer lead decrease learning motivation . Therefore , Livan ( 2001 ) assert educationist first understand student 's innate cognitive ability , give priority develop subject match student 's cognitive ability , student 's learning interest achievement outcome raise , eventually model/strategy also work subject actually match student 's cognitive ability . This suggestion , extent , alignment previous work ( Chang Tsai , 2005 ) , find teacher-centered instructional approach seem enhance positive attitude less constructivist-oriented learning preference student , whereas student-centered method beneficial constructivist-oriented learning preference student attitude toward earth science computer-assisted learning environment . In process develop undertake BCNG system , research project start innate factor might affect learner ' cognitive ability . Based understanding relationship exist cognitive ability genotype possible cognition-related gene , appropriate instructional model strategy might appropriately develop good assist/match student ' learning . 1 . Using exist test battery understand subject ' intellectual functioning , memory , visual-spatial perceptual function , executivefunction , attention science problem-solving ability . 2 . Identifying genetic polymorphism human COMT , BDNF , 5-HT6 gene Taiwan investigate single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) gene among Taiwanese subject use PCR DNA sequence . 3 . Screening compare allelic distribution SNP among tested subject explore cognitive-associated SNP ( ) gene .</detailed_description>
