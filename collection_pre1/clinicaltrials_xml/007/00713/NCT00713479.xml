	<brief_summary>More people worldwide use amphetamine-type stimulant illicit drug besides cannabis , methamphetamine ( MA ) abuse dependence fast grow drug problem United States . Much work remain identify effective pharmacotherapy MA dependence . The neurobiological action produce MA involve dopamine ( DA ) , serotonin , norepinephrine , also include alteration cholinergic neurotransmitter system . Candidate compound target acetylcholine ( ACh ) attractive option development receive adequate attention . Varenicline drug increase release DA brain logical assume would extent compensate reduction neurotransmitter occur MA withdrawal . Current research link certain gene relate neurotransmitter drug abuse memory impairment ( e.g. , A1 allele D2 dopamine receptor catechol-O-methyltransferase ) . We take blood sample test gene order relate finding brain function . This double-blind , placebo-controlled , within-subjects study determine safety tolerability MA MA-dependent volunteer treat varenicline placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Assessment Safety Varenicline Methamphetamine-dependent Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedures : Study participant meet criterion MA dependence , seek treatment , also meet criterion nicotine dependence . Participants ask wear telemetry device screen throughout study record heart rate body temperature . Participants require refrain smoking certain time , illicit prescription drug use duration study confirm daily urine testing . The study consist 30 day less outpatient screening . The 2-component inpatient portion study last total 18 day . Participants admit GCRC UCLA Days 1-10 . After first study day , participant randomize varenicline match placebo 9-days discharge GCRC . Then , 2-4 week , subject return GCRC switch alternate condition ( placebo varenicline ) second component study , last another 8-days . Each subject randomize varenicline placebo , total time commitment 18 inpatient study day . One follow-up visit schedule 2 week completion study phase assessment delayed adverse event final payment . On first day inpatient procedure , subject receive 10 3mg infusion methamphetamine 2.5 hour assessment drug tolerability . On day 9 first component day 7 second component , subject receive either 10 3mg infusion saline OR methamphetamine 2.5 hour . In afternoon , infusion opposite morning condition .</detailed_description>
