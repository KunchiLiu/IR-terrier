	<brief_summary>This study test reliability procedure self-administering ethanol ( alcohol ) intravenously ( vein ) , use computer-assisted method . People ordinarily self-administer alcohol drink alcoholic beverage , blood alcohol level result drinking vary greatly among individual . For research alcohol dependence treatment , tool achieve precise blood level need . In addition test method alcohol administration , study examine self-administration behavior result breath alcohol concentration , effect alcohol participant , difference men woman alcohol self-administration . Healthy normal volunteer 21 45 year age may eligible study . Participants assign one two study group . Group 1 undergoes three 7-hour study session group 2 participate two session , include follow procedure : - Breathalyzer urine test alcohol illicit drug use . - Urine pregnancy test woman . - Light lunch . - Questionnaire health recent drinking . Alcohol infusion : Subjects seat comfortable chair instruct use computer give short infusion alcohol catheter ( plastic tube ) insert vein arm . Sensors place chest monitor heart beat neck record skin blood flow . At start session , subject complete questionnaire drug effect urge drink may feel . They train use computer administer alcohol allow self-administer alcohol catheter time like , long peak breath alcohol level exceed 0.1 g % ( level would result ingestion 4 6 drink people ) . If point reach , computer automatically inactivate self-administration level lower . Breathalyzer reading take every 15 30 minute . Subjects may read , watch television video listen music session . Recovery : At end 2.5 hour self-administration , catheter remove subject eat , read , watch television relax clinic breath alcohol level fall 0.02 g % , usually 2.5 3 hour , go home taxi pre-arranged designate driver .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The goal project characterize computer-assisted self-administration ethanol ( CASE ) paradigm assess intravenous ( IV ) alcohol self-administration behavior result breath alcohol concentration ( BrAC ) exposure pharmacologic response healthy non-dependent participant . The study also evaluate test-retest reliability alcohol self-administration examine influence sex recent drinking history , well effect acute stress cue alcohol self-administration . Study population : Participants 21-60 year-old male female social drinker binge drinker good health , determine medical history , physical exam , ECG lab test . Participants Axis-I psychiatric illness include alcohol substance dependence exclude . Design : The CASE system utilizes model-based algorithm base previously publish method achieve maintain pre-determined BrACs use IV alcohol infusion . The CASE system provide flexibility participant choose push button receive alcohol , well flexibility investigator control subsequent BrAC exposure . The CASE system allow investigator specify assure BrAC increment across participant , set prevent BrAC exceed pre-set upper limit ( e.g. , 100 mg % ) . Following screening , participant undergo IV ethanol self-administration session . Participants enrol four group : Group 1 consist first 10 participant participate 3 self-administration session ( train session follow 2 test session ) assess test-retest reliability alcohol self-administration behavior . Group 2 consist 50 participant , participate 2 self-administration session ( train session follow test session ) . During session , participant first undergo direct priming period , last 25 min , prompt push button receive small standardized alcohol infusion . This follow ad-lib period , last 2 hr , free access standardize IV alcohol infusion . During session , BrAC measure , heart-rate skin blood flow continuously record , subjective perception alcohol effect urge assess . Group 3 consist 15 participant , undergo two identical progressive work self-administration session evaluation test-retest reliability . During progressive ratio ( PR ) schedule session , participant require push button progressively high number time subsequent alcohol infusion 2.5 hr period . Group 4 consist 100 participant , participate 2 session : one ad lib self-administration session one PR schedule self-administration session . Group 5 consist 40 participant , undergo baseline self-administration session follow interview session construction guide imagery script . Following , participant undergo three alcohol self-administration session , follow exposure personalize stress- , alcohol- neutral-condition associate script , present randomized order separate day . Outcome measure : The primary endpoint BrAC exposure ( high BrAC , average BrAC , area-under-the-BrAC-time-curve ) achieve self-administration session . Additionally , change subjective perception alcohol effect , well change heart rate evaluate . The influence sex recent drinking history well genetic polymorphism self-administration alcohol also examine . Furthermore , individual-specific cellular response alcohol exposure examine use induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSCs ) participant select base genotypic phenotypic variation self-administration measure . Outcome measure group 5 include stress alcohol cue-induced crave self-administration . The CASE paradigm valuable tool evaluate determinant may underlie self-administration behavior human . The effect pharmacological agent alcohol self-administration evaluate marker clinical effectiveness agent treatment alcohol-dependence .</detailed_description>
