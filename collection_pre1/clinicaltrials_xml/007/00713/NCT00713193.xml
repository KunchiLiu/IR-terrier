	<brief_title>Study Cyclosporine Corticosteroids Adjunct Plasma Exchange Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( TTP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TTP rare blood disorder cause blood clot form small blood vessel throughout body , include kidney , brain , abdomen , heart . Plasma exchange standard treatment TTP . Plasma exchange treatment remove plasma ( liquid portion blood without cell ) patient replaces plasma donor . With plasma exchange , 90 % patient achieve remission disease . Unfortunately , one half patient relapse plasma exchange stop , lead significant complication add risks patient . This study randomize patient receive either prednisone cyclosporine adjunct plasma exchange , cyclosporine arm experimental arm study . All patient undergo plasma exchange randomize receive either prednisone cyclosporine adjunct plasma exchange . Previous study suggest cyclosporine superior prednisone adjunct plasma exchange , therefore randomize study attempt confirm finding two previous single institution study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients clinical diagnosis idiopathic TTP define microangiopathic hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 100 x 103 ) Additional component pentad ( fever , renal neurologic abnormality ) need present . Additional explanation microangiopathic change include DIC malignancy exclude . Patients pregnancy associate TTP permit therapeutic trial child deliver prior initiation therapy TTP . However , female patient breastfeed unwilling discontinue breastfeed time enrollment exclude study Patients previous diagnosis TTP eligible enrol provided meet eligibility criterion treat TTP past 30 day Given potential nephrotoxicity CSA , patient must serum creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl prior enrollment In light concern prompt initiation PE , patient suspect TTP may enrol trial . If subsequently find patient meet enrollment criterion , remove spot replace study purpose . Patients remove study enrollment continue follow longitudinally 6 month monitor safety include safety database . Patients TTP clinically categorize secondary stem cell transplant solid organ , bloody diarrhea associate , malignancy associate , drug associate enrol therapeutic study . Incarcerated patient exclude study due inherent difficulty maintain close followup study purpose patient incarcerated . Any patient already treat chronically corticosteroids cyclosporine take time presentation exclude study . Female patient breastfeed unwilling discontinue breastfeed time enrollment exclude study Patients take medication contraindicate combination CSA safely discontinue exclude study .</criteria>
