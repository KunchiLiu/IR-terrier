	<detailed_description>As survival rate prognosis cancer improve , increase recognition presence long term negative impact standard chemotherapy cognition , namely domains attention , memory , psychomotor speed executive function . The purported incidence varies 10-50 % , mechanism unknown unclear risk . This impact also study documented Asian population . This proposal outline study intend prospectively ( 1 ) investigate document incidence severity cognitive impairment follow systemic chemotherapy breast cancer Asian woman acute prolonged setting , ( 2 ) relate cognitive change damage DNA lipid ( two major target attack toxic agent ) indicate test conduct blood urine sample . Thirty breast cancer patient require undergo standard chemotherapy recruit pilot study determine acceptability procedure establish size effect investigation . A 45-minute neurocognitive assessment administer three time point : commencement chemotherapy , 6 month 1 year follow completion chemotherapy . Blood urine sample collect prior commencement chemotherapy , first cycle chemotherapy , also 6 month 1 year post completion chemotherapy . It hypothesize ( 1 ) decrement performance neurocognitive measure post-chemotherapy ; ( 2 ) presence cognitive decline correlate presence marker oxidative damage blood urine sample . The benefit project two fold . Firstly , allow research documentation possible presence cognitive decline follow chemotherapy Asian woman , important allow patient make fully-informed consent regard treatment . Secondly , relationship presence cognitive decline presence biochemical marker oxidative damage establish , potentially lead new treatment method may reduce cognitive decline associate chemotherapeutic process .</detailed_description>
