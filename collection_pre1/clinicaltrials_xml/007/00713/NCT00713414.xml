	<brief_summary>This study examine brain control speech patient spasmodic dysphonia , voice disorder involve involuntary spasm muscle larynx ( voice box ) , cause break speech . Although cause spasmodic dysphonia unknown , recent study find change brain function patient disorder may play role development . People 21 80 year age adductor spasmodic dysphonia may eligible study . Candidates screen follow procedure : Medical history physical examination . Nasolaryngoscopy examine larynx . For test , inside subject nose spray decongestant small , flexible tube call nasolaryngoscope pass nose back throat allow examination larynx . The subject may ask talk , sing , whistle say prolonged vowel procedure . The nasolaryngoscope connect camera record movement vocal cord task . Voice speech record measure type severity voice disorder . Subjects ask question voice disorder voice record repeat sentence sound . Participants undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain , follow : PET : A catheter place vein subject arm inject radioactive substance call tracer detect PET scanner provide information brain function . [ 11C ] flumazenil use one scan session [ 11C ] raclopride use another . For scan , subject lie bed slide doughnut-shaped scanner , wear custom-molded mask support head prevent move scan . For first scan subject lie quietly 60 minute . For second scan , subject lie quietly 50 minute ask say sentence another 50 minute . The amount radiation receive study equal uniform whole-body exposure 0.9 rem , within dose guideline establish NIH Radiation Safety Committee research subject . The guideline effective dose 5 rem receive per year . MRI : This procedure use strong magnetic field radio wave instead X-rays obtain image brain . The subject lie table slide scanner , narrow metal cylinder , wear ear plug muffle loud knock sound occur scan . Images brain structure obtain subject lie still machine 10 minute . This follow functional MRI ( fMRI ) 60 minute , picture take subject speaks , show change brain region involve speech production .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spasmodic dysphonia ( SD ) writer cramp ( WC ) primary focal dystonias selective impairment voluntary control speak writing , respectively . Although pathophysiology SD WC unknown , dystonia consider disorder basal ganglia lead secondary cortical subcortical sensorimotor dysfunction . Results recent neuroimaging study establish microstructural abnormality , well alteration functional activity neurotransmission within basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitry symptom production patient . Abnormal functional relationship brain region may play important role pathophysiology dystonia . However , organization functional network neurochemical correlate underpin abnormality , date , fully investigate . A pharmacological report patient provide indirect evidence contribute role major basal ganglion neurotransmitter , &gt; =-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) dopamine , pathophysiology disorder . We identify decrease D2/D3 receptor bind rest abnormal dopamine release symptomatic asymptomatic task SD WC compare control . We also identify altered GABAergic transmission , especially involve laryngeal hand sensorimotor cortex . These change neurotransmission may , turn , couple abnormality network functional activity patient thus contribute pathophysiology disorder . There , therefore , critical need investigate contribution dopaminergic transmission via D1-family receptor well dopaminergic function substantia nigra , par compacta ( SNc ) , order fully characterize abnormality dopaminergic neurotransmission disorder . Filling knowledge gap essential development effective neuropharmacological treatment patient SD WC , limit , date , short-term benefit injection botulinum toxin affect muscle every 3-4 month lifetime . Objective The objective application determine role play major basal ganglion neurotransmitter pathophysiology primary focal dystonia . The central hypothesis dopaminergic transmission selectively alter within nigro-striatal direct basal ganglion pathway correlate abnormal dopaminergic function within indirect basal ganglion circuitry SD WC patient . Study Population : We plan examine patient adductor SD ( ADSD ) compare two group subject : ( 1 ) patient another form task-specific focal dystonia ( writer cramp , WC ) ( 2 ) healthy volunteer without history neurological , psychiatric , head neck disorder . The research volunteer may spouses person SD WC without familial relationship . Design : This natural history study . Using neuroimaging technique ( positron emission tomography ( PET ) , central hypothesis test pursue two specific aim : ( 1 ) map D1-like dopaminergic receptor bind SD WC patient measure PET use [ 11C ] NNC-112 ; ( 2 ) map nigro-strital dopaminergic function SD WC patient measure PET use [ 18F ] FDOPA . Outcome Measures : These study determine neurotransmitter function patient ADSD WC compare healthy subject . The propose research expect advance understand pathophysiology voluntary motor control voice hand movement diseased individual important step identify possible mechanisms potential neuropharmacological intervention patient .</detailed_description>
