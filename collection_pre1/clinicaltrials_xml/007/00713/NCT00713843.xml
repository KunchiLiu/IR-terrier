	<detailed_description>Detailed information Manual Therapy accord Utrecht School Manual Therapy ( MTU ) MTU base assess patient 's individual preference function document interpret natural asymmetry anatomical form , posture movement . The normal asymmetry variability human form movement function specify . Asymmetrical form related asymmetrical movement function . In addition general diagnostics , MTU characterize specific diagnostics . By mean specific manual-therapeutic analysis individual preference function model patient drawn analysis interpretation individual asymmetry form , posture movement . Some explanation measurement movement : ( prefer ) hand folding ; ( prefer ) arm folding ; eye master eye ; leg use ( prefer ) kick ball . The purpose describe optimal direction position movement ax joint accord model . When compose model , firstly individual characteristic ( number prefer movement , number asymmetrical aspect posture form ) assess . Documentation , notation interpretation characteristic take place accord protocol . The objective MTU optimize position movement axes joint . To achieve , three-dimensional movement joint execute repeatedly . To purpose fully position movement ax therapist ( repeatedly ) perform passive joint movement low velocity high accuracy . In addition examine individual preference movement , exploratory examination carry recognize possible red flag determine treatment indication . Treatment base preferred movement find patient interpretation accord protocol movement complaint patient . It execute apply passive articular movement spinal joint joint extremity . During process physiological joint limitation carefully observe ; traction high-velocity movement apply , may case form manual therapy . The diagnostic examination form manual therapy focus joint function , stability , movement pattern , range movement , severity disorder . To diagnose patient complaint , palpation passive accessory passive intervertebral movement use . The result yield information tenderness ( pain ) , restrict intersegmental motion ( stiffness ) , spasm ( muscle tension ) .</detailed_description>
