	<brief_summary>Over past several decade , considerable effort expend toward successful cryopreservation various human cell . While attempt cryopreservation direct different tissue type , one vigorously pursue target reproductive tissue . Historically , cryopreservation human sperm exist several decade . The early report pregnancy ( Trounson et al. , 1983 ) birth ( Zeilmaker et al. , 1984 ) cryopreservation human embryo occur early 1980s . Presently , freeze storage human embryo follow vitro fertilization ( IVF ) standard practice fertility clinic . In 2003 , CDC Assisted Reproductive Technology success rate report state 4,246 live birth occur 17,517 non-donor frozen embryo cycle . . Because human egg relatively voluminous cell abundant cytoplasm , crystallization time freezing may result damage organelle . Secondly , mature metaphase II oocyte contains fragile spindle apparatus involve cleavage . The purpose research study evaluate method freeze thaw oocyte . This evaluation make compare survival rate rate fertilization , cleavage embryo quality fresh oocytes frozen-thawed oocyte inseminate IVF ( vitro fertilization ) treatment cycle . In addition , comparison make frozen oocyte infertile woman egg donor . You ask study currently undergo vitro fertilization .</brief_summary>
