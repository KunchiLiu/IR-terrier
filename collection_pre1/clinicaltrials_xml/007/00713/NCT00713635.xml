	<brief_title>Prenatal Effects Congenital Heart Disease ( CHD ) Neurodevelopmental Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital heart disease ( CHD ) common class birth defect major cause infant child death morbidity , include neurodevelopmental delay . Children severe form CHD high risk spectrum neurocognitive difficulty include learn disability , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , behavioral problem mental retardation . The etiology neurodevelopmental delay child CHD fully understand thought secondary combination pre- post-natal insult brain . It observe fetus severe form CHD abnormal blood flow brain measure Doppler ultrasound . This `` centralization '' redirection blood flow toward vital organ brain show lead abnormal brain development fetal disease , intrauterine growth restriction . Evidence importance prenatal brain development set CHD amount . Neonates complex CHD demonstrate abnormality brain structure blood flow prior cardiothoracic surgery . However , date , association abnormal fetal brain blood flow neonatal neurologic outcome brain function establish CHD population . Finally , newborn CHD show abnormality heart rate 24 hour period . This finding suggest autonomic nervous system , control heart rate blood pressure , may function properly infant CHD . The study propose change blood flow fetus heart disease could responsible part poor brain growth , abnormal brain structure function developmental delay childhood . Investigators use routine obstetrical ultrasound fetal echocardiograms evaluate blood flow vital organ brain growth fetuses CHD . Investigators use non-invasive fetal monitor measure fetal heart rate movement . Investigators look brain structure use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) fetus newborn . Afterbirth , investigator use non-invasive monitor measure neonatal heart rate blood pressure change response tilt , similar experience place infant car seat . Investigators use non-invasive monitor consist sticker apply skin measure level oxygen brain . Investigators also measure brain function newborn electroencephalogram ( EEG ) record electrical signal different part brain use special plastic hat like swim cap . Regular physical exam pediatrician measure growth development take place . A special test design detect learning disability also do child 14 month old . This test consist talk child , read story , show child picture color . There extra blood test need none test pose risk mother , fetus , infant , child . The possible benefit child family early identification brain abnormality newborn period well learn disability toddler allow child receive therapy design treat problem . Studies show early identification treatment learn disability important enhance potential child .</detailed_description>
