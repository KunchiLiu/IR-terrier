	<brief_summary>This study patient head neck cancer recur body area previously receive radiation , surgery plan . A widely accept treatment option situation chemotherapy alone . Another approach use clinical trial treat patient repeat course radiation . In study , patient receive chemotherapy time radiation . In clinical study , wish treat radiation plus two drug course reirradiation , Taxotere® ( docetaxel ) Erbitux® ( cetuximab ) . Docetaxel cetuximab chemotherapy drug administer vein . Both drug help radiation kill cancer cell . The radiation administer use strategy call intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , focus radiation beam tumor . Docetaxel cetuximab approve treatment patient head neck cancer . However , combination radiation + docetaxel + cetuximab patient recurrent head neck cancer consider topic clinical research . The purpose study determine good bad effect treatment radiation + docetaxel + cetuximab .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pathologically ( histologically cytologically ) confirm diagnosis recurrent second primary head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) patient past history definitive radiation therapy head neck cancer . Patients initial diagnosis neck metastasis suspect occult primary head neck eligible . Patients histologic variant spindle cell carcinoma , poorlydifferentiated keratin positive carcinoma , lymphoepithelioma eligible . Patients may eligible unresected recurrent disease prior radiation field . Patients also may eligible undergone surgical resection recurrent disease prior radiation field follow poor risk pathologic feature : Malignant involvement 2 regional lymph node Extracapsular extension nodal disease Microscopically involve mucosal margin resection ( 5 mM less ) Perineural involvement Resected soft tissue disease Oral cavity oropharyngeal primary nodal disease level IV V Patients must prior radiation head neck cancer ≥ 50 % recurrent tumor within area radiate least 45 Gy , exceed 72 Gy . Greater 6 month interval prior external beam radiation treatment . ( Patients receive intraoperative radiation therapy [ IORT ] within 6 month registration may eligible , subsequent disease recurrence IORT field criterion eligibility otherwise meet ) . KPS &gt; = 70 % Age &gt; = 18years Adequate bone marrow function : ANC &gt; = 1,500/μl , platelet &gt; = 100,000/μl , Hgb &gt; = 8 g/dL . Adequate hepatic function . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test . Men woman childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception treatment least three month thereafter . Patient must sign informed consent document . Anticipated lifetime spinal cord dose exceed 54 Gy , brain stem exceed 65 Gy , optic chiasm exceed 55 Gy , optic nerve exceed 60 Gy . Three palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens recurrent metastatic disease set . Pregnancy lactation . Distant metastatic disease . Other active malignancy , indolent malignancy investigator determines unlikely interfere treatment efficacy analysis . For example , patient nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ carcinoma cervix , prostate cancer within current biochemical ( PSA ) radiologic evidence disease may enroll . Serious concomitant medical disorder ( example , active infection , uncontrolled seizure disorder , unstable angina ) , opinion investigator , would compromise safety patient compromise patient 's ability complete study . History severe hypersensitivity reaction docetaxel drug formulate polysorbate80 . History severe infusion reaction monoclonal antibody . Patients multifocal peripheral sensory alteration paresthesias ( include tingle ) interfere function , per patient report ( example : activity daily live ) .</criteria>
