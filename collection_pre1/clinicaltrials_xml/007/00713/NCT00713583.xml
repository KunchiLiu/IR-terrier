	<brief_summary>Cocaine dependence major public health problem development treatment disorder priority . To date , treatment intervention base positive incentive principle show strong effect improve substance use outcome . One example contingency management ( CM ) intervention nondrug reward use compete cocaine . Recent evidence suggest certain medication improve response CM intervention , particularly agent target dopamine reward system brain . A promising dopamine-enhancing medication levodopa . We observe strong effect levodopa medication administer context CM therapy , perhaps mechanisms enhance reward saliency . The propose study design evaluate promising treatment approach . Cocaine dependent outpatient participate randomize , 2-group ( levodopa vs. placebo ) , double-blind clinical trial . CM behavioral therapy platform treatment group . Potential treatment predictor related reward saliency motivation assess treatment . We test primary hypothesis CM+levodopa effective CM+placebo reduce cocaine use . This study expect validate usefulness new behavioral-pharmacological treatment approach cocaine dependence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cocaine dependence major public health problem development treatment disorder priority . To date , treatment intervention base reinforcement principle show robust empirical support improve substance use outcome . One example contingency management ( CM ) intervention nondrug alternative introduce environment goal increase ratio reinforcement derive nondrug stimulus ratio drug-derived reinforcement . Cocaine dependent individual vary responsiveness sensitivity nondrug reinforcer , however , limit factor efficacy CM intervention . Recent line evidence suggest certain medication add efficacy CM intervention , particularly agent target dopaminergic ( DA ) action cocaine reinforcement . A particularly promising medication investigate DA precursor levodopa , agent increase store available central DA DA-deficient individual . We observe strong effect levodopa medication administer context CM therapy . A plausible explanation efficacy combination treatment levodopa , give concomitantly CM , enhance saliency value incentive , turn motivate goal-directed behavior ( abstinence ) . The propose study design replicate , predict , extend effect promise treatment approach . Cocaine dependent outpatient participate randomize , 2-group ( levodopa vs. placebo ) , double-blind clinical trial . Abstinent-based contingency management procedure serve behavioral therapy platform treatment group . Potential treatment predictor related attentional bias motivation assess baseline treatment . We hypothesize CM+levodopa effective CM+placebo reduce cocaine use effect CM+levodopa significantly associate level attentional bias motivation pretreatment treatment . Finally , expect demonstrate continue levodopa treatment ( versus placebo ) follow discontinuation CM extend abstinence duration . This study expect validate usefulness novel behavioral-pharmacological treatment , shed light mechanism underlie synergism DA augmentation strategy reinforcement-based therapy .</detailed_description>
