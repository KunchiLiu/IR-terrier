	<detailed_description>Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage absolute emergency field neurosurgery , also devastate event commonly result major neurological disability mortality . Since disease severity clinical course vary patient , pathophysiological study prognostic factor always worth research . From previous study , know dysregulation autonomic system play important role intracranial hemorrhage . Hemorrhage associated sympathoexcitation , patient develop rebleeding infarction complication find even high degree sympathetic storm . Therefore , degree autonomic activity seem useful predictor . Traditionally , sympathetic activity measure plasma catecholamine , parasympathetic activity hard measure . In recent decade , application engineering biological field make great breakthrough . Waveform analysis biological signal , electrocardiograms arterial blood pressure , indirectly determine autonomic activity . The variability heart rate blood pressure subject frequency analysis . This generate several dominant frequency band . High frequency band ( 0.15-0.40Hz ) attribute effect parasympathetic nervous system , , low frequency band ( 0.04-0.15 Hz ) attribute effect sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system . In study , patient spontaneous intracranial bleeding undergo standard treatment monitoring . This include electrocardiography , arterial blood pressure , cerebral blood flow use transcranial Doppler sonography . For also intracranial pressure monitoring , intracranial pressure also record . All biological signal export wave form analysis . We use frequency analysis , time-frequency analysis , multiscale entropy analyze data . The result analysis also correlate plasma catecholamine level , proinflammatory marker , well clinical variable . Our aim identify predictor complication grave outcomes biological signal . We also apply result future pathophysiological study .</detailed_description>
