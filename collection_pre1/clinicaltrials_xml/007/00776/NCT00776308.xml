	<brief_summary>Conventional mammography reliable method determine extent disease woman breast cancer . Molecular Breast Imaging ( MBI ) new nuclear medicine technique allow breast imaged manner similar mammography , without pain compression . Initial result method show good detect small breast cancer ( ~1/4 inch ) . The purpose study see MBI good method mammography determine much cancer present woman go surgery . The study comprise 120 woman breast cancer go surgery . The investigator hope study demonstrate MBI accurate determine much cancer present .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The sensitivity conventional mammography evaluation extent disease , detection multifocal breast cancer contralateral breast cancer poor . Molecular Breast Imaging ( MBI ) new nuclear medicine technique permit breast imaged manner similar mammography , utilize Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride ( CZT ) gamma camera . We develop first dual-head MBI system world preliminary result system indicate high sensitivity ( ~90 % ) detection breast cancer &lt; 10mm . The AIM study determine sensitivity MBI relative mammography preoperative evaluation extent disease ipsilateral contralateral breast woman biopsy-proven breast cancer . We test HYPOTHESIS MBI sensitive mammography preoperative evaluation surgical planning . The study comprise 120 woman biopsy-proven breast cancer prior surgery . All patient diagnostic mammogram MBI study prior operation . At time operation pathologic finding correlate mammogram MBI result . This study demonstrate use MBI three aspect breast cancer diagnosis : 1 ) detection multifocal / multicentric disease elsewhere ipsilateral breast , 2 ) detection contralateral breast cancer , 3 ) correlation index tumor size MBI pathologic size . These result may justify role MBI routine pre-operative evaluation breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
