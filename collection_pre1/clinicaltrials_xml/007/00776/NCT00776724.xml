	<brief_title>Tailored Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Stage II/III Breast Cancer With Tumor Size More Than 2 cm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter randomize phase III trial . The purpose evaluate compare pathological complete response ( pCR ) rate neoadjuvant chemotherapy tailor chemotherapeutic regimen standard chemotherapy stage II/III breast cancer tumor size 2 cm . For primary operable breast cancer , neoadjuvant chemotherapy one standard option . Pathological complete response ( pCR ) associate significantly improve long-term disease free overall survival . Anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy regimen study extensively prospective trial frequently prescribe treatment patient breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Regimens test large multicenter phase III trial yield pCR rate around 15 % 20 % 6 cycle chemotherapy . Recent evidence show expression several protein tumor sample tau , topoisomerase II alpha ( topo II ) , ERCC1 predict tumor response taxanes , anthracyclines , platinum , respectively . We hypothesize select chemotherapeutic agent accord expression drug sensitivity predictive biomarkers patient 's tumor sample may improve efficacy breast cancer treatment . In randomized phase III trial , TE ( Docetaxel/ epirubicin ) give control arm since highly active regimen breast cancer . In Tailored chemotherapy arm , 7 different combination chemotherapy regimens contain 2 drug among taxotere , epirubicin , cisplatin , vinorelbine , 5FU , give accord expression tumor biomarkers . The dos schedule regimen select accord publish 1st line protocol breast cancer . The primary endpoint pCR rate . After 4 cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy , assumption pCR rate 15 % TE arm , achieve 80 % power 5 % level ( one side ) significance detection 15 % increase pCR rate tailor regimen arm , 134 patient either arm include study . If 10 % drop-out rate multi-center study variation effect consider , totally 316 patient require .</detailed_description>
