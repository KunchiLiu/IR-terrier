	<brief_summary>BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring ( HM ) service enable doctor safely follow ( FU ) ICD CRT-D patient remote fashion , few in-clinic consultation . This may result efficient FU cost-savings health care payer . The EuroEco study : 1 . Outlines new HM-based FU model ICD CRT-D patient combine in-clinic consultation regular check ups patient/ICD/CRT-D data receive HM service . 2 . Compares direct cost physicians clinic HM-based FU ICD CRT-D patient versus traditional FU . 3 . Compares indicator patient ' safety two FU model .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>European Health Economic Trial Home Monitoring ICD CRT-D Patients ( EuroEco )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The EuroEco prospective , international , randomize study aim assess economic effect BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring ( HM ) technology compare traditional follow ( FU ) ICD CRT-D patient two perspective : 1 ) cost-effectiveness payer health care , 2 ) economic impact physician , hospital patient . The study outline new model FU ICD-and CRT-D patient base combination in-clinic consultation regular check ups patient data receive HM service . About 312 patient indication ICD therapy 104 patient indication de novo CRT-D implantation enrol . All patient implant BIOTRONIK ICD CRT-D device Lumax family randomize ( 1:1 ) traditional , HM-based FU model . Traditional FU perform accord local clinical practice . Patients HM study arm first undergo local clinical FU routine first in-clinic visit patient discharge . Thereafter routine in-clinic FUs schedule 12 24 month . Three HM data check carry 12-month interval , assess patient/ICD/CRT-D status remotely . In ( HM HM ) group , additional in-hospital FU may schedule time patient report symptom presume cardiovascular symptom . In HM group , additional in-clinic FU may also schedule result specific HM finding . The following FU-related activity account : in-clinic consultation , patient contact , discussion colleague physician , nurse technician arrange clinic consultation . In HM patient , two additional HM-related FU activity take account : 1 ) check website BIOTRONIK HM Service Center , 2 ) check HM-related email fax ( provide BIOTRONIK HM Service Center ) .. Several tool make available document time physician , nurse technician spend FU activity without disrupt clinical routine much : - designate case report form - web-based time measurement software . A user manual time measurement hand physician , nurse technician recommend tool use clinical situation . The average time per patient follow accord traditional FU model average time per patient follow HM-based FU model calculate three health care professional consider ( physician , nurse technician ) . The difference cost traditional HM-based FU assess statistical significance . This trial may provide data warrant change guideline use ICD CRT-D device feature HM function , HM may justify prolongation time interval statutory routine in-clinic FU visit . Coupled fact information provide HM help physician recognize otherwise unsuspected need additional FU visit , may ultimately result good cost-effective health care part involve ( patient , provider payer ) .</detailed_description>
