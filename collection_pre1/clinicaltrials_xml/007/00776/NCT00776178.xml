	<brief_summary>Background : - Bladder cancer often recur treatment patient survival varies greatly . - More knowledge need factor help identify patient great risk disease recurrence progression minimize need screen help guide treatment . - The New England Study Environment Health ( NESEH ) , conduct department health Maine , New Hampshire Vermont , Dartmouth Medical School NIH , examine relationship health environmental factor smoke , diet water quality New England . This study provide opportunity learn patient bladder cancer . - Before launch full-scale follow-up study bladder cancer , necessary determine feasibility obtain need follow-up information patient enrol NESEH . Objectives : -To determine completeness quality information treatment , recurrence , progression obtain patient medical record . Eligibility : -Participants NESEH study resident Maine diagnose bladder cancer 2001 2003 . Design : - Determine vital status NESEH bladder cancer patient . - Select sample 40 living 18 deceased patient . - Interview patient next kin telephone 30 45 minute update exposure information , obtain name address hospital physician see since diagnosis , obtain authorization access medical record . - Obtain abstract medical record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow-Up Bladder Cancer Patients From New England Study Environment Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Bladder cancer highly recurrent disease substantial variability survival . - Patients currently undergo repeat cystoscopy many year diagnosis . - There need identify prognostic marker recurrence progression minimize need routine screening identify patient treat aggressively . - The New England Study Environment Health ( NESEH ) , population-based case control study 1,213 patient Maine ( ME ) , Vermont ( VT ) , New Hampshire ( NH ) , provide excellent opportunity study clinical , host-genetic , environmental determinant prognosis . - Before launch full-scale follow-up study , need determine feasibility follow population-based case series obtain patient-related ( vital status , exposure ) tumor-related ( recurrence , progression , pathology ) information . Objectives : To determine : - The completeness quality information obtain patient . The important issue extent medical record private physician need , whether private physician cooperative . - Our ability identify next-of-kin ( NOK ) decease patient . - The proportion patient ( NOK ) contact enroll . - The ability NOK provide information exposure . Eligibility : -Bladder cancer patient ME participate original case-control study ( age 30-79 , newly diagnose histologically-confirmed carcinoma bladder , include carcinoma situ ) , exclude diagnosed 2003 ( 5 year follow-up need ) . Design : - Conduct interview 40 living patient NOK 9 deceased patient update exposure information find patient receive health care , type treatment receive , whether disease recur progress . - For living patient NOK unable locate ( estimate 10 living patient 9 NOK ) , request medical record health care provider ( see physician provide record absence authorization form ) . - Evaluate participant physician response rate completeness medical history information obtain . - We proceed full study obtain sufficient medical information 70 % living patient . - We examine whether important issue relate deceased patient ( e.g. , NOK identification/enrollment , exposure assessment , access medical record ) . If , consider simple approach segment population ( e.g. , survival study base NDI Plus information available NESEH ) .</detailed_description>
