	<brief_title>Vorinostat Low Dose Cytarabine High Risk Myelodysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open-label , non-randomized , Phase I/II study . Patients treat either arm A B dosing schedule contain increase duration exposure vorinostat . LD Ara-C administer daily , subcutaneously ( SC ) , 10 mg/m² Cycle 1 escalate 20 mg/m² daily Cycle 2 14 28 day . Oral vorinostat administer 400 mg , daily either sequentially ( Arm A ) concurrently ( Arm B ) LD Ara-C Dose Level # 1 7 day , Dose Level # 2 10 day , Dose Level # 3 14 day 28-day cycle . Patients disease progression continue meet eligibility criterion may receive 3 additional 28-day cycle treatment .</detailed_description>
