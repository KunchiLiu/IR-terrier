	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Sometimes , chemotherapy , tumor may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective observation chemotherapy treat non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well radiation therapy work compare observation chemotherapy treat patient stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Observation After Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess whether addition radiotherapy radiographically apparent residual disease initial course standard chemotherapy result improvement overall survival patient oligometastatic stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - To compare progression-free survival patient treat radiotherapy v observation standard chemotherapy . - To compare time disease progression time treatment failure patient . - To compare confirm response rate patient . - To compare duration response patient . - To compare adverse event patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior treatment bevacizumab first-line chemotherapy ( yes v ) , number standard chemotherapy course ( 2-3 v 4-6 ) , Linear Analog Self Assessment value ( ≤ 7 v &gt; 7 ) , histology ( predominantly squamous cell v predominantly squamous cell ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo observation 6 week . - Arm II : Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week sit gross disease . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
