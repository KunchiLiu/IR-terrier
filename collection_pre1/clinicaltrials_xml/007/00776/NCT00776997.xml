	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness LINX Reflux Management System treatment Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LINX Reflux Management System Clinical Study Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present , primary alternative GERD patient incomplete symptomatic response proton-pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication . This surgical procedure continue prevalent non-medical treatment option GERD patient , despite several important limitation . First , traumatic procedure , require portion stomach dissect wrap around tubular esophagus , create permanent anatomic alteration . Secondly , create significant side effect , gas bloat syndrome , inability belch inability vomit . The intent LINX System allow surgeon , use exist laparoscopic technique instrument , augment weak LES restore defective barrier gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) . This defect GEJ source abnormal reflux . The LINX device expandable string individual titanium bead magnetic core . The device laparoscopically place ring around low esophageal sphincter . The magnetic attraction bead augments esophageal sphincter 's ability resist gastric pressure cause reflux . At rest , LINX device encircles sphincter bead rest adjacent bead , avoid compression tubular esophagus . When swallow , high pressure create , allow magnetic bond bead break , LINX implant expand radially . This serve preserve swallow physiologic function , belch vomiting , avoids side effect post-prandial bloating . The device place minimal dissection , preserve anatomy , also removable , necessary . This provide important benefit preserve native anatomy , unlike Nissen procedure .</detailed_description>
