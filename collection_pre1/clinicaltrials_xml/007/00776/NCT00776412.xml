	<brief_summary>This study collect information marker inflammation , blood clot blood vessel function HIV-infected adult healthy volunteer . Biomarkers biological indicator associate disease . Certain marker inflammation , blood clotting , blood vessel function associate risk cardiovascular disease , stroke death . One marker , call D-dimer , breakdown product blood clot associate serious medical condition , include deep vein thrombosis ( formation blood clot vein deep body ) pulmonary embolism ( blockage pulmonary artery occur blood clot vein break away , travel pulmonary artery lodge ) . High D-dimer level also associate cardiovascular disease stroke risk . In recent study HIV-infected patient , high D-dimer level strongly correlate risk death cause . The significance change D-dimer biomarkers HIV-infected adult well understood . This study explore D-dimer biomarkers try good understand relationship HIV infection . Healthy volunteer HIV-infected adult 18 year age old may eligible study . Two visit involve , follow : Visit 1 ( screen visit determine eligibility ) - Medical history physical examination . - Blood test HIV infection , blood count , liver kidney function . - Pregnancy test woman become pregnant . Visit 2 - Blood test hepatitis B C - Blood test marker inflammation blood clotting . - Blood test genetic change influence blood clotting . In case , visit 1 2 may combine . Optional additional visit ( 8 visit 3 year ) - Additional blood draw investigation specific clinical laboratory finding may request .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>D-dimer , fibrin degradation product generate result plasmin mediate clot dissolution process , indicator recent clot formation subsequent fibrinolysis . Analysis D-dimer concentration employ diagnosis deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , disseminate intravascular coagulation . More recently , D-dimer level correlate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . In recent case-control study biomarkers cardiovascular disease human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected adult , baseline D-dimer level strongly correlate all-cause mortality . Notably , association baseline D-dimer level death due cardiovascular disease less significant . At present , pathophysiology underlie association elevate D-dimer concentration mortality HIV understood . This study seek identify possible mechanism underlie D-dimer elevation HIV-infected adult investigate number pathway may associate elevation use biomarkers inflammation , hemostasis , thrombosis , platelet function , lipid metabolism , additional indicator endothelial function . Further elucidation plausible pathway contribute D-dimer elevation could , ultimately , lead trial risk-reducing intervention patient elevate D-dimer level . This study , exploratory , cross-sectional study 325 subject , seek prospectively collect data D-dimer related biomarkers HIV-infected adult . Initially , study recruit HIV-infected adult HIV viremia take antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) compare clinical history biomarker finding ( 1 ) group HIV-infected adult control HIV viremia receive ART , ( 2 ) control group HIV-negative healthy subject . Additionally , study impact persistent immune activation inflammation immune response ART , cohort HIV-infected adult poor CD4+ cell recovery despite effective ART , good understand mechanism contribute impaired immunologic recovery , cohort HIV-infected adult poor CD4+ cell recovery despite effective ART enrol ( immunologic non-responder cohort ) comparison , control group similar nadir CD4 count good CD4+ cell recovery ART . The study require 2 visit screen , history physical examination , phlebotomy . A wide array research assay investigate different aspect inflammation , coagulation , endothelial function complete . Samples store future investigation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age great equal 18 year Ability understand provide inform consent Adequate venous access Adequate blood count ( hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dL , platelet great equal 50,000 cells/mm ( 3 ) ) Willing able comply study requirement procedures include storage blood sample use future study HIV , AIDS , immune function , inflammation , coagulation , atherosclerosis Negative serum pregnancy test female childbearing potential ( female subject medical documentation hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy need undergo pregnancy test ) For HIVnegative subject : No known history HIV infection . At enrollment , HIV antibody test perform confirm negative HIV1 antibody status . For HIVpositive subject : Established HIV diagnosis ( previous documentation HIV1 infection subject medical record ; subject without confirmation , positive ELISA testing confirm Western Blot plasma HIV viral load great 10,000 copies/mL ) Must care physician HIV general medical issue . For HIVpositive subject enrol immunologic nonresponder cohort : CD4 count le 300 cells/mm ( 3 ) two year effective combination ART documentation viral suppression HIV viral load le 50 copies/mL screening , viral load great 1,000 copies/ml period viral suppression . Not currently receive medication know associate low CD4 count No concurrent illness know cause low CD4 count Controls cohort historical nadir CD4 count le 300 cells/mm3 , current CD4 count great 300 cells/mm3 three year effective combination ART documentation viral suppression . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant breastfeed Known bleed clot disorder Current use prescription anticoagulant include warfarin , low molecular weight heparin , clopidogrel platelet aggregation inhibitor Concurrent malignancy require cytotoxic chemotherapy radiation therapy Substance abuse severe psychiatric disorder would interfere adherence protocol requirement Any serious medical condition principal investigator feel participation may contraindicate</criteria>
