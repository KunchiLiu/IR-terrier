	<detailed_description>Background : Increasing gastro-intestinal viscosity colonic fermentation suggest help improve appetite control reduce food intake . Beta-glucan ( BG ) fructo-oligosaccharide ( FOS ) food ingredient propose act way , result far remain inconclusive . Objective : To test effect FOS , BG , combination bar appetite rating food intake 2 consecutive day . Design : In 4-way balanced order cross-over double-blind design , 21 healthy volunteer ( mean BMI 25.9 kg/m2 ) receive meal replacement bar 09.00h ad libitum lunch 13.00h 2 consecutive day . On day 1 , subject consume second ( identical ) bar 17.00h fix snack 19.00h . The control bar contain 0.3g BG ( control , 6.8 g oat ) , vs equi-caloric bar formulation contain additional : 1 ) 0.9 g BG ( 8.0g barley ) , 2 ) 8g FOS , 3 ) 0.9 g BG + 8g FOS . Appetite score subsequent ad libitum test meal intake measure . Bar viscosity determine simulated gastric condition . Results analyze use ANCOVA . Results : Addition BG , FOS combination affect appetite rating food intake , although addition BG bar double apparent gastric viscosity ( 841 vs 351 mPa.s ) . Conclusions : BG , FOS combination bar level improve appetite control consume 2 consecutive day . Efficacy might increase longer exposure period , increase BG content , form BG generate even high gastric viscosity .</detailed_description>
