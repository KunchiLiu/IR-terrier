	<brief_summary>This study two purpose . First , investigator identify determinant change motor ability , activity daily live , HRQOL distribute Constraint-induced therapy patient stroke Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector ( CHAID ) analysis . The result help target types/characteristics patient benefit intervention may identify different determinant across different level outcome . Secondly , order understand extent treatment effect term clinical relevance , investigator examine whether change score measure motor ability , activity daily live , HRQOL distribute CIT reach clinically important difference .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determinants Practical Significance Change Motor Ability , Functional Performance , HRQOL After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke major cause long-term disability many country . More 50 % stroke survivor experience resultant upper extremity ( UE ) movement impairment lead activity limitation restriction participation . Various contemporary rehabilitation strategy aim improve UE motor deficit stroke propose . Constraint-induced therapy ( CIT ) one current promising approach , numerous CIT distribute CIT study show substantial evidence positive treatment effect . Although study show form distribute CIT enhance motor function affect UE , functional performance , aspects HRQOL post stroke , determinant relate distributed CIT outcome remain unclear . In addition , mismatch statistically significant clinically important difference ( CID ) change score identify limitation CIT study . Investigation CID critical understanding clinically relevant meaning change score intervention . Therefore , purpose project ( 1 ) identify determinant change motor ability , functional performance , HRQOL distribute CIT patient stroke use Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector analysis ; ( 2 ) examine whether change score outcome measure distribute CIT reach CID . Within one year , plan complete cumulate data distribute CIT trial 70 subject . The distributed CIT intervention provide two certified occupational therapist . The Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA ) , Wolf Motor Function Test ( WMFT ) , Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) , Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) use outcome measure project . Six potential predictor select FMA , WMFT FIM , seven potential predictor select SIS base previous empirical finding theoretical basis . CHAID analysis use identify specific determinant best split point determinant . In addition , base Cohen 's effect size benchmark , change score FMA , WMFT , FIM SIS exceed 0.2SD consider CID . After one-year project , identify determinant motor ability , functional performance , HRQOL distribute CIT thus help understand factor may affect treatment outcome target patient benefit intervention . Additionally , provide result CID good evaluation interpretation change score distribute CIT .</detailed_description>
