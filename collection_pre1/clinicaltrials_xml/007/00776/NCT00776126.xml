	<brief_summary>Mammography remain current standard detection breast cancer . However , conventional two-view mammography detect cancer . The major limit factor conventional mammography presence superimpose breast tissue obscure clinically significant lesion . It limitation decrease sensitivity mammography lead false negative result . The recent development digital detector allow image technology tomosynthesis become clinically feasible . The examination , similar conventional mammography regard patient position glandular dose , allow acquisition digital data set reconstruct viewed multiple section . The ability tomosynthesis unmask overlap structure show preliminary study increase lesion visibility . Used either primary imaging modality , adjunct screen mammography , tomosynthesis potential provide increase sensitivity lower number false negative examination . The purpose study compare radiologist impression digital breast tomosynthesis digital mammography respect ability see characterize specific lesion feature .</brief_summary>
