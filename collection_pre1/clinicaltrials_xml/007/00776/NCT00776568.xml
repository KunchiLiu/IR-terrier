	<brief_title>Treatment Refractory Angina Pectoris Shock Wave Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients advance CAD frequently limit symptom recurrent angina , angina low work threshold , breathlessness , debilitate condition . These patient often several `` re-do '' coronary bypass procedure multiple percutaneous coronary intervention . Surgical interventional option patient typically exhaust result partial revascularization . Therefore , therapy remains limited use multiple anti-anginal medication , reduce activity , exertion , stress level , significant alteration limitation lifestyle . The goal emerge approach therapeutically induce growth development new vasculature zone severe ischemia myocardium , hope new capillary arteriole generate connect remnant exist vasculature . These neovessels view act collateral , perfuse ischemic territory unapproachable macro procedure PCI and/or CABG .</detailed_description>
