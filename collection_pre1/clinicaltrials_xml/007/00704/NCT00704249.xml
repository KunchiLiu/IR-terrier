	<brief_title>VENICE Study Nevirapine Full Dose/Dose Escalation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis HIV infection change radically 1996 thanks arrival protease inhibitor ( PI ) , , combine 2 nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) form so-called highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . HAART lead considerable decrease incidence mortality opportunistic infection make HIV infection chronic condition necessarily progressive , irreversible , fatal disease 1996 . The initial euphoria lead people believe HAART could cure disease , soon clear eradication virus impossible treatment would continue indefinitely . Chronic treatment become difficult frequent onset adverse event extremely complex regimen high pill burden administer several time per day , often dietary restrictions.1,2 In context , adherence difficult , efficacy far optimal , patient 's quality life noticeably reduce . The subsequent appearance non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) —nevirapine efavirenz—considerably improve disadvantage PIs . Today , combination 2 NRTIs NNRTI consider regimen choice start antiretroviral therapy . Efavirenz consider gold standard initial antiretroviral therapy widely use clinical practice . More half patient start treatment efavirenz present adverse effect , although generally well tolerated decrease time . Approximately 3 % -8 % patient suspend efavirenz due adverse effect , mainly neuropsychiatric . In case , efavirenz usually replace nevirapine . Nevirapine substrate potent inducer hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system ( CYP3A4 others ) continuous administration lead progressive autoinduction metabolism . The recommend dose 200 mg every 12 hour . If dose administered start treatment , plasma concentration reach first day much high reach later . Therefore , toxicity nevirapine associate plasma concentration , recommend initial dose 200 mg/d first 14 day follow 200 mg every 12 hour indefinitely . There specific recommendation dosage nevirapine replaces efavirenz ; therefore , administer increase dos accord summary product characteristic . Efavirenz also potent inducer CYP3A4 increase metabolism drug use metabolic pathway . Enzyme induction increase synthesis enzymes involve , result , inducer suspend , enzyme induction effect persist day excess enzymes catabolize . Furthermore , half-life efavirenz long . Consequently , plasma concentration fall progressively week drug withdrawn . Therefore , efavirenz replace nevirapine , residual enzyme induction persists might lead fall plasma concentration nevirapine . Given NNRTIs low genetic barrier development resistance , fall plasma concentration nevirapine 14 day administer 200 mg/d generate resistance mutation virologic failure . When efavirenz switch nevirapine , unknown whether nevirapine start increase standard dos ( 200 mg/d first 14 day plus 200 mg bid thereafter ) full dose ( 200 mg every 12 hour ) consequence enzyme induction cause efavirenz . Currently available data enable u make recommendation dose treatment nevirapine start patient require efavirenz withdrawn nevirapine choose alternative . Nevertheless , despite small sample size , preliminary study suggest strategy could effective safe . Therefore , randomize clinical trial enable u evaluate strategy appropriately necessary</detailed_description>
