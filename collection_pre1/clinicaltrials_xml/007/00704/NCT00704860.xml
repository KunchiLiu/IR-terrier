	<brief_summary>Reduction volume hippocampus associate major depression many study . It suggest antidepressant may protect hippocampus volume loss human associate multiple episode depression may also reverse reduction volume cause depression . In addition , genetic marker serotonin implicate depression , may indication reduce response antidepressant treatment . This study aim enroll patient define treatment resistant depression ( remission least 2 treatment trial antidepressant ) . They receive MRI scan initial visit either 6 month sustain remission 12 month enter study non-remitters . They also ask give blood sample genotyping . They match age handedness healthy volunteer personal history depression also receive MRI scan genotyping . The first aim compare hippocampal volume depressed subject healthy control . It anticipate subject initially small hippocampal volume sustain remission , small increase hippocampal volume . It also anticipate specific genetic marker related individual response antidepressant treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals define treatment-resistant major depression ( failure least 2 trial antidepressant adequate dose ) currently meet DSM-IV criterion depression qualify study . At initial visit , subject give MRI order perform volumetric analysis hippocampus blood sample take order determine genotype 5-HT1a ( serotonin ) promoter . Each patient aggressively treat ( open label ) depression goal remission . A second MRI scan complete 6 month sustain remission 12 month baseline remission meet sustain . The investigator select healthy volunteer control personal first relative history depression match subject base age handedness . Genotyping MRI scan perform healthy subject order compare parameter . Hypothesis : It anticipate hippocampal volume small matched control . It also anticipate Homozygous G ( -1019 ) genotype prevalent patient group healthy subject . In addition , hypothesize investigator find small increase hippocampal volume long-term treatment . Also , non-responders homozygous G ( -1019 ) 5-HT1a genotype great degree hippocampal atrophy . Moreover , hypothesize patient carry long allele 5-HTTLPR polymorphism 5-HTT might show good response antidepressant general . Finally , anticipate TPH*A variant gene cod tryptophan hydroxylase associate poor outcome .</detailed_description>
