	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Gene-modified lymphocyte may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . High-dose aldesleukin may stimulate lymphocyte kill tumor cell . Vaccines make gene modified virus person 's dendritic cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving gene-modified lymphocyte together high-dose aldesleukin vaccine therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gene-modified lymphocyte together high-dose aldesleukin vaccine therapy work treat patient progressive recurrent metastatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine administration anti-p53 T-cell receptor ( TCR ) gene-engineered peripheral blood lymphocyte , high-dose aldesleukin , adenovirus p53 dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine nonmyeloablative , lymphoid-depleting , preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic cancer overexpresses p53 . Secondary - Determine vivo survival T-cell receptor ( TCR ) gene-engineered cell . - Determine ability dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine restimulate TCR gene-engineered cell vivo . - Determine toxicity profile treatment regimen . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord type metastatic cancer ( melanoma renal cell cancer v cancer ) . - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) collection : Patients undergo PBMC collection via leukapheresis generation adenovirus p53 dendritic cell vaccine well anti-p53 T-cell receptor ( TCR ) gene-engineered peripheral blood lymphocyte . - Nonmyeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day -7 -6 fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute day -5 -1 . - Peripheral blood lymphocyte infusion : Patients receive anti-p53 TCR gene-engineered peripheral blood lymphocyte IV 20-30 minute day 0 . Patients receive filgrastim ( growth colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) ) subcutaneously ( SC ) daily begin day 1 2 continue blood count recover . - High-dose aldesleukin : Patients receive high-dose aldesleukin IV 15 minute three time daily day 0-4 15 dos . - Dendritic cell vaccine : Patients receive adenovirus p53 dendritic cell vaccine SC day 0 , 7 , 14 , 28 . Patients may receive one re-treatment course ( nonmyeloablative preparative regimen , peripheral blood lymphocyte infusion , high-dose aldesleukin , dendritic cell vaccination ) begin 6-8 week last dose high-dose aldesleukin . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 15 year .</detailed_description>
