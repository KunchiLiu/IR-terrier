	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - ass effectiveness lenalidomide treatment patient relapse refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma ; , - ass safety lenalidomide . There report suggest therapeutic benefit thalidomide patient refractory and/or relapse Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma 's ( NHL ) lead formal investigation lenalidomide treatment relapse NHL 's .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Therapy Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory , Peripheral T-Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL 's ) represent subgroup Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma poor prognostic feature . Compared aggressive B-cell lymphoma , PTCL 's often present advanced disease sustain less durable remission follow treatment chemotherapy . With standard anthracycline-based regimen CHOP ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ) , PTCLs achieve inferior 5-year overall survival rate around 40 % compare aggressive B-cell lymphoma whose 5-year overall survival rate reach 50-60 % . While several salvage regimen establish B-cell lymphoma moderate success , guideline patient relapse and/or refractory PTCL 's less clear . Several report suggest immunomodulatory drug ( IMiDs® ) clinical activity setting . The aim phase 2 study evaluate activity lenalidomide relapse and/or refractory PTCL 's .</detailed_description>
