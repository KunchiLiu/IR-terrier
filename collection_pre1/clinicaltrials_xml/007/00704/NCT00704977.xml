	<brief_title>Alcohol 20 % Separation Pterygium Comparison Different Wound Closure Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pterygium fibrovascular tissue grow conjunctiva cornea . The disturbance/morbidity cause pterygium diverse , range mild esthetic disturbance till recurrent inflammation significant decrease visual acuity . Rate pterygium 20 % -49 % general population , increase number observe population equatorial region . Pterygium usually appear age 22-49 year . While rate pterygium appearance increase age , recurrence rate surgical removal high young patient . Treatment pterygium surgical . The main challenge surgery peel pterygium prevention recurrence . During last two decade several method develop become widely accept pterygium surgery . The emphasis modify pterygium surgery do initial phase surgery - technique pterygium separation final phase - wound closure method , additionally adjuncts ( Mitomycine C ) become widely use . These modification consider improve surgical outcome decrease rate complication recurrence rate . Currently popular technique pterygium separation include Blunt dissection + keratectomy ( blunt separation tissue + dissection superficial layer cornea ) ; Avulsion technique ( Avulsion pterygium head create tension cap edge+ optional blunt dissection ) ; Air assist dissection ( injection air side pterygium cap create good separation plane ) . Alcohol 20 % widely use surface refractive surgery , help peel easily epithelium cornea . Several report show positive role alcohol treatment recurrent corneal erosion resistant treatment . At microscopic level - ethanol split basement membrane level lamina lucida lamina densa , additionally ethanol destroy hemidesmosome junction epithelial cell . No consensus exist ethanol influence keratocyte viability function : study show delay wound heal significant keratocyte damage , work show significant alteration keratocyte number use alcohol . At phase pterygium separation purpose check safety efficiency alcohol 20 % peel pterygium ocular surface . Various closure technique exist , 3 widespread technique : Bare sclera ( adjunct mitomycine C ) - wound leave , without closure . Sliding conjunctival flap- conjunctiva adjacent region dissect , move wound area suture . Amniotic membrane transplantation , use biological glue adhere membrane . Amniotic membrane carry HLA antigens - HLA compatibility test need . Amniotic membrane underwent screen infectious disease cryopreserved . Amniotic membrane apply mesenchimal part towards sclera basement membrane side upwards . Adhesion amniotic membrane achieve biological glue ( contain thrombin calcium main ingredient ) We intend compare method wound closure conjunction use alcohol 20 % pterygium separation .</detailed_description>
