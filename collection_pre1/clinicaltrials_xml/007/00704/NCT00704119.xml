	<brief_summary>RhuDex® ( code number AV1142742 ) novel , orally bioavailable , low molecular weight modulator co-stimulation T lymphocytes . RhuDex® bind protein CD80 ( also know B7-1 ) surface antigen-presenting cell inhibit interaction CD28 ( CTLA-4 ) present CD4+ T lymphocytes . RhuDex® develop treatment rheumatoid arthritis . To improve oral bioavailability , study drug co-administered alkaline buffer increase gastric pH value . In previous vitro phase I study , meglumine identify effective buffer . Study CT 5002 design evaluate bioavailability four increase dos RhuDex® , combine fixed amount meglumine use tablet formulation , feed fasted condition well co-administration proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole . Furthermore , dose/plasma concentration proportionality single dose accumulation effect repeat dose RhuDex® evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Pharmacokinetic Profile RhuDex® Tablet Formulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized , monocentric Phase I study evaluate pharmacokinetic profile single-dosed repeat-dosed RhuDex® use tablet formulation well assess effect food effect co-administration proton pump inhibitor bioavailability RhuDex® . 12 healthy male subject receive study medication 8 different treatment period 4 subsequent step A , B , C D. Within step A B , subject receive different treatment ( 4 A 2 B ) , sequentially . There wash-out period least 4 day 8 different treatments/treatment period step A , B , C D. In Step A , subject receive increase dos RhuDex® 4 subsequent treatment . In Step B , subject receive 2 different dos RhuDex® precede pantoprazole intake , 2 subsequent treatment , Step C RhuDex® dose precede standardized high-fat , high-calorie meal . In Step D , RhuDex® administer twice daily 7 day . For assess pharmacokinetic profile RhuDex® step A , B C , blood sample collect prior different interval RhuDex® administration . In step D , blood sample collect Days 1 , 2 , 4 7 . Cmin , Cmax , tmax , t½ term , CL/F , AUC ( 0-t ) , AUC ( 0-∞ ) RhuDex® analyze . Safety evaluate regular observation documentation AEs , vital sign , physical examination , ECG , laboratory parameter .</detailed_description>
