	<brief_summary>Formation new blood vessel ( angiogenesis ) important tumor growth advance cancer . It known tumor make protein call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . VEGF stimulate formation blood vessel supply tumor nutrient oxygen . PTC299 oral investigational new drug show decrease production VEGF animal model human cancer . In animal model , oral PTC299 administration decrease VEGF level tumor bloodstream , decrease blood vessel number tumor , significantly slow halt tumor growth . When give combination chemotherapeutic drug , docetaxel , PTC299 increase antitumor activity use docetaxel alone . Safety study research animal indicate good tolerability dos drug level higher plan clinical study . Results Phase 1a study healthy volunteer indicate PTC299 achieves level PTC299 bloodstream know active animal model human cancer . This Phase 1b study design test hypothesis PTC299 tolerable show evidence anti-VEGF antitumor activity administer orally patient cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct 3 stage . In Stage 1 study , successive group 3 6 patient receive progressively high PTC299 dose level ; stage , treatment give repeat 6-week cycle consist 4 week oral PTC299 twice per day follow 2-week , no-drug period . In Stage 2 , additional group 3 6 patient enrol tolerable dose level receive treatment repeat 6-week cycle consist oral PTC299 administer 2 3 time per day continuously ( ie , without 2-week no-drug period Stage 1 ) . In Stage 3 , additional group 3 6 patient enrol tolerable dose level receive treatment repeat 3-week cycle consist oral PTC299 administer 2 3 time per day continuously combination docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 week ) . All plan dose level stage expect achieve circulate blood level PTC299 know active animal model human cancer . Treatment patient continue long therapy appear safely offering tumor control patient . Up 76 evaluable patient accrue across 3 stage .</detailed_description>
