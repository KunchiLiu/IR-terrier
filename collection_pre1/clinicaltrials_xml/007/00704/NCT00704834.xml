	<brief_summary>The purpose study test difference RNA level Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) patient normal subject . RNA provide `` message '' gene alter disease . We also test DNA determine small mutation call SNPs gene . The last test two separate test marker inflammation call cytokine eicosanoids . This research may lead discovery biological marker MS useful diagnosis treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This investigator-initiated , pilot study gene expression ( RNA ) blood patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The study enroll patient UC Davis Multiple Sclerosis clinic . At single study visit , confirm eligibility , obtain clinical information , collect blood sample . We process sample obtain RNA subsequent microarray analysis . DNA also use examine single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) chip allow u examine 1 million SNPs . The SNPs may allow u diagnose disease like multiple sclerosis predict treatment cause . In addition , DNA may use determine small mutation gene individual donate blood . Additional study do blood plasma , test inflammatory molecule call eicosanoids cytokine . The data test superimpose microarray data determine molecular profile patient . We compare data obtain patient group determine gene alteration specific condition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>male female race Between age 18 70 year Diagnosed clinically isolated syndrome diagnosis multiple sclerosis use widely establish Macdonald criterion . A 'clinically isolated syndrome ' refers isolate attack optic neuritis , transverse myelitis , brain demyelination . Relapsingremitting MS characterize acute relapse follow degree recovery without worsen disability relapse . Chronic progressive MS define sustain progression physical disability , occur separately relapse , patient MS. Control subject male female , age 18 70 year , race , symptom MS. Children exclude study MS generally disease young adult onset rare child . Evidence infection communicable disease , cancer know systemic disease , anticoagulation , know bleed disorder , illicit drug abuse , change medication last 30 day ( include treatment steroid ) . Patients receive immune modulating medication ( steroid , cyclophosphamide , mitoxantrone , methotrexate , mycophenolate mofetil , azathioprine , IVIG rituximab ) prior thirty day exclude study</criteria>
