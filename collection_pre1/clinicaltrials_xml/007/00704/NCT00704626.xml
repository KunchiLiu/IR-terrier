	<brief_summary>Under normal condition immune system protect u infection tumor . The immune system recognize infect organism tumor foreign body attack . One way immune system attack foreign target make protein call antibody bind target . Sometimes , reason poorly understand , immune system wrongly identify part body foreign attack . This result disease form diabetes thyroid disease , well neurological disease . In study , one tablespoon blood remove subject test see immune system make antibody component nerve muscle . We also hope learn antibody contribute development worsen illness nervous system . Only one blood draw require , subject may ask give 8 additional blood sample see level antibody change time . Any additional blood draw would perform regularly schedule clinic visit . There would least 3 month blood draws period 3 year , request physician . Depending diagnosis , physician may also request collection mouth ( buccal ) cell . This take one minute painless . The cell collect swish swab around mouth . This cheek swab would do blood draw . Please note study conduct ONLY UC Davis participant must see clinic locate Sacramento , CA . Results test perform study give participant . This study intend treat diagnose condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine frequency auto-antibodies 1 ) heat shock proteins 2 ) molecule include cytoskeletal protein rapsyn diseases nervous system . 5cc serum obtain patient multiple sclerosis autoimmune inflammatory diseases nervous system include myasthenia gravis transverse myelitis patient neurological disease . Standard methodology assure safe handling serum use . Diluted serum test specific reactivity heat shock protein ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) well antigens standard ELISA well immunoblot . Buccal swab also obtain conjunction blood draw . Rapsyn cytoskeletal protein extract Torpedo californica electric organ mean differential centrifugation follow alkali extraction . For ELISA , standard titration curve obtain positive control serum previously determine . Negative control serum obtain individual degenerative neurological disease . Titers test serum determine dilution generates positive result two standard deviation mean background . Positive ELISA result confirm immunoblot . Patients may test one time point . If serum positive specific antibody binding , additional serum sample may obtain retested 8 time approximately 3 month apart . Correlation severity clinical finding specific antibody titer make . Severity clinical finding determine neurological exam do investigator .</detailed_description>
