	<detailed_description>Low back pain ( LBP ) common medical problem challenge condition treat . This study investigate effectiveness conservative treatment approach chronic LBP . To point treatment approach specifically address resolution underlie pathology lead high probability recurrence LBP . Further , current treatment option lumbar disc pathology limit demonstrated effectiveness . The purpose study determine whether non-surgical therapeutic approach design effect intervertebral widening allow reduction disc protrusion reduce patient ' pain improve activity level . The study ass whether computer-assisted traction treatment [ decompression ] protocol result improvement patient pain level daily activity level . Further , determine treatment result intervertebral widen reduction disc protrusion demonstrate direct imaging lumbar spine . A double-blind ( treatment vs. sham treatment ) design employ Specific Aims To study effectiveness decompression therapy LBP patient lumbar disc herniation degenerative disc problem . To demonstrate decompression therapy LBP patient result demonstrate reduction level report pain . To demonstrate decompression therapy LBP patient result demonstrate great return daily activity . To demonstrate decompression therapy LBP patient result increase intervertebral space reduce disk protrusion ( present ) measure MRI .</detailed_description>
