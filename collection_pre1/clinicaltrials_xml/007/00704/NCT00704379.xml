	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead cause death disability among young adult . Mood disorder frequent psychiatric complication TBI , large impact family functioning , interpersonal relationship , ability return work school . Furthermore , significant proportion disorder progress chronic treatment refractory form . In spite clinical relevance , mood anxiety disorder remain largely unrecognized adequately treat , contribute great disability decrease participation aftermath TBI . The goal study learn people recover brain injury evaluate effect sertraline ( also know Zoloft ) compare placebo ( inactive substance ) prevent occurrence emotional behavioral problems—such depression , lack motivation , anxiety , irritability aggressive outbursts—following TBI . In study , group 104 participant TBI—recruited immediately resolution posttraumatic amnesia—will randomly assign receive six month double-blind treatment sertraline placebo . This study determine emotional behavioral problem influence thinking , physical recovery , return productive life six month brain injury . Researchers also determine certain brain change predict occurrence behavioral problem treatment sertraline prevent . Additionally , researcher examine effect sertraline frequent post-TBI behavioral disorder aggression , impulsivity , poor decision make apathetic symptom . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -based volumetry diffusion tensor image use examine structural correlate mood anxiety disorder evaluate biological predictor treatment response community reintegration . The researcher hypothesize early preventive treatment sertraline reduce mood behavioral symptom , prevent occurrence structural functional brain change associate onset mood disorder , increase access participation rehabilitation program TBI , , consequently , improve psychosocial outcome .</detailed_description>
