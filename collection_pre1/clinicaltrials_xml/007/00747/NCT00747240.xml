	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study determine whether association presence platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase ( PAF-AH ) gene polymorphisms development chronic lung disease low birth wight infant . Infants &lt; 1500 gram birth require mechanical ventilation enrol first 5 day life obtain informed consent . A total 1 ml blood drawn utilized isolation DNA genotyping measurement PAF-AH activity serum .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic lung disease ( CLD ) frequent severe complication premature birth . Between 3,000 7,000 infant develop CLD per year United States [ 6 , 7 ] . Mortality rate infant CLD vary 5 % 30 % [ 8 , 9 ] . Despite recent advance neonatal care incidence CLD decrease , likely due survival small immature infant . Current therapy CLD , many demonstrate short-term long-term efficacy , include diuretic , bronchodilator , corticosteroid . No therapeutic study publish date demonstrate single medication combination medication improve survival dramatically decrease severity duration illness . The specific mechanism ( ) lead CLD clearly define , likely multiple factor contribute disease . The important factor implicate , directly indirectly , prematurity , barotrauma , oxygen toxicity , inflammation infection [ 7 ] . Although barotrauma oxygen toxicity may directly injure immature lung , recruitment activation inflammatory cell may potentiate lung damage impair healing . Several study show persistent elevation neutrophil , alveolar macrophage high concentration lipid mediator tracheal effluent infant CLD [ 7 ] . Activated inflammatory cell lung may release product alter pulmonary function / damage lung tissue lead pulmonary edema , airway hyper-reactivity , pulmonary hypertension pathophysiologic characteristic infant chronic lung disease [ 10 ] . Activated neutrophils macrophage secrete platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) . PAF phospholipid diverse , potent physiologic activity . Many pathophysiologic abnormality CLD correlate action PAF . For example , PAF increase vascular permeability , could lead pulmonary edema . PAF cause bronchoconstriction vascular smooth muscle constriction could lead increase airway resistance pulmonary vascular resistance see CLD . PAF proinflammatory cause recruitment activation inflammatory cell . At least two author find evidence increase PAF tracheal effluent infant develop CLD [ 11-13 ] . One mechanism closely regulate expression PAF enzyme responsible degradation , PAF-acetylhydrolase ( PAF-AH ) . PAF-AH phospholipase specific PAF PAF-like lipid . Acquired deficiencies PAF-AH activity implicate variety inflammatory condition , include asthma . In addition acquire deficiency , Miwa et al describe inherited form PAF-AH deficiency Japanese population [ 14 ] . Stafforini et al , University Utah , clone PAF-AH gene describe point mutation gene explains inherit PAF-AH deficiency [ 1 , 2 ] . In study Japanese patient , find PAF-AH gene modulate locus severity asthma . Recently , variant PAF-AH gene find associated inflammatory disease , particular asthma , Caucasian population [ 3 ] . A study perform twin reveal possible genetic susceptibility chronic lung disease prematurity [ 15 ] . It possible genetic alteration pro anti-inflammatory gene may contribute predisposition development chronic lung disease . It know whether inherited deficiency PAF-AH activity may contribute CLD . This study would begin address possibility genetic factor predispose development CLD preterm infant . If result observational study show association inherit developmental deficiency PAF-AH activity development CLD , prospective randomize clinical trial treatment recombinant PAF-AH prevent CLD might consider .</detailed_description>
