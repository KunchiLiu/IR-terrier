	<criteria>Written inform consent obtain patient 's legal representative accord local regulation start study procedure prescreening Patients sedate ventilated ICU sedation expect clinically require least 24 hour , determine responsible physician Prescribed light moderate sedation ( target RASS = 0 3 ) Acute severe intracranial spinal neurological disorder due vascular cause , infection , intracranial expansion injury Uncompensated acute circulatory failure screening ( severe hypotension mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) &lt; 55 mmHg despite vasopressor inotrope therapy ) Heart rate ( HR ) &lt; 50 beats/min longer 5 min screen start study treatment Atrioventricular ( AV ) conduction block IIIII ( unless pacemaker instal ) Severe hepatic impairment ( e.g . bilirubin &gt; 101 μmol/L ) Need continuous muscle relaxation Any condition would significantly interfere collection study data Burn injury condition require regular anesthesia surgery Use centrally act alpha2 agonist antagonist within 24 hour prior start study ( e.g . dexmedetomidine , clonidine , tizanidine , apraclonidine brimonidine ) Known allergy dexmedetomidine excipients study treatment Patients expect treatment withdrawn withhold due poor prognosis Patients receive sedation therapeutic indication rather tolerate ventilator ( e.g . epilepsy ) Patients unlikely require continuous sedation mechanical ventilation ( e.g . GuillainBarré syndrome ) Patients unlikely weaned mechanical ventilation ; e.g . diseases/injuries primarily affect neuromuscular function respiratory apparatus clearly irreversible disease require prolonged ventilatory support ( e.g . high spinal cord injury advance amyotrophic lateral sclerosis )</criteria>
