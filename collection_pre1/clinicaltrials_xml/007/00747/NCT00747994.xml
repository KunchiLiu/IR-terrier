	<brief_summary>Paget 's disease bone frequent bone disorder usually start age 40 characterize bone pain deformity . Although often without symptom , disease may severe complication fissure , fracture , neurological compression , deafness . In case , genetic disorder transmit dominant autosomal pattern inheritance : one two parent carry disease transmits offspring risk 50 % child . Since 2002 , first gene involve Paget 's disease bone know 14 mutation gene publish . A study confirm presence mutation associate young age onset extensive disease . Thus , knowledge genetic factor relative affect individual allows screen patient high risk complication , may benefit medical follow earlier treatment , order avoid complication . Indeed , Paget 's disease bone may treat efficiently bisphosphonates . This project aim identify collect one year , 15 affected individual affect Paget 's disease bone relatives second degree relativeness ( total 100 individual expect ) . The blood sample may analyse order search mutation previously know gene and/or search new mutation new gene .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Study Families Affected Paget 's Disease Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Paget 's disease bone chronic bone disorder late onset , usually age 40 . This disease transmit dominant autosomal pattern inheritance incomplete penetrance . Since 2002 , first gene ( SEQUESTOSOME 1 SQSTM1 ) involve Paget 's disease bone know . Actually , 14 mutation gene locate exon 7 8 report familial form disease well sporadic form . Although size sample study literature rather small establish phenotype genotype correlation , seem presence mutation associate earlier onset disease extensive disease . However , presence mutation seem sufficient explain whole development disease , functional analysis may help understand real effect mutation . The link genetics observation PARANYXOVIRAL inclusion nucleus osteoclast actually establish . The hypothesis interaction gene environment may plausible several author . The result study 94 sporadic French patient Paget 's disease bone lead identification two new mutation SQSTM1 gene show presence double SQSTM1 mutation . This study establish phenotype genotype correlation , affected individual carry mutation young age diagnosis polyostotic involvement . This phenotype genotype correlation major element may help target relative risk complication , may benefit early treatment prevent complication occurrence . Primary objective : recruit 15 patient affect Paget 's disease bone , familial form , relatives healthy affect , second degree relativeness ( total 100 individual ) genetic study Paget 's disease bone : DNA collection , blood puncture RNA collection , serum collection urinary collection study bone remodelling parameter . DNA sample use search mutation involve Paget 's disease bone collaboration research center University hospital center LAVAL , Quebec , Canada . Inclusion exclusion criterion describe elsewhere . Description protocol : - Identification affect patient ( 15 index case ) . Inclusion visit index case : information project signature consent , validation inclusion criterion index case , clinical exam , answer questionnaire . Detailed family pedigree information give index case relatives second degree relativeness participation present study . Blood puncture urinary collection , image require next three month previously do . Inclusion visit relative , healthy affect Paget 's disease bone : Information project signature consent , validation inclusion criterion , clinical exam answer questionnaire , blood urinary collection . Imaging require healthy relative bone scintigraphy next three month skull pelvis radiography . For affected relative , image test require previously do . Exams realize patient study : Each individual , healthy affect Paget 's disease bone , include study , undergo biological test ( alkali phosphatases , creatinin gammaGT ) imaging test realize past 10 year ( bone scintigraphy /or radiographies skull pelvis ) . Blood puncture do extract DNA , RNA serum sample urinary sample collect . Benefits risk : Benefits : The realisation biological imaging exam search asymptomatic lesion Paget 's disease bone , may lead fortuitously identify bone lesion various etiology , treatment follow may beneficial relative , kind benefit certain . The identification SQSTM1 mutation relative may lead early treatment may prevent occurrence complication . Indeed , efficient medical treatment Paget 's disease bone ( bisphosphonates ) . There benefit index case , affect relative . Known risk : Pain due veinous blood puncture et irradiation bone scintigraphy and/or radiography . Numbers patient : 15 patient affect Paget 's disease bone relatives first second degree relativeness , total 100 individual . This number base feasibility recruitment fact family may pool analysis family Quebec allow increase power detect linkage analysis new mutation , new haplotype and/or new gene . Main objective : New mutation new haplotype already identify mutation , new mutation new gene disease . Expected result : - According frequency SQSTM1 mutation familial form disease , mutation gene may identify 1/3 family , ie 5 family . In family , haplotype study may show two major haplotype contain P392L mutation . This family material identify mutation may useful search phenotype genotype correlation search modifier factor ( genetic , epigenetic , environmental ) . - In 10 family , SQSTM1 mutation expect . Those family may pool family genetic background ( French Canadian ) , may allow reach sufficient power detect linkage analysis new region genome may contain gene Paget 's disease bone .</detailed_description>
