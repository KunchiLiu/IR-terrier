	<brief_summary>This prospective vitro cell biology study polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN ) protein synthesis response PAF . PMNs cord blood premature human infant risk NEC ( birth weight 501 - 1500 gram ) PMNs cord blood healthy term infant isolate stimulated PAF , biologically active phospholipid implicate pathogenesis NEC . NEC , disease prematurity incidence 10.1 % infant bear weigh 501 - 1500 gram , associate significant morbidity mortality . We compare protein synthesis inflammatory modulators , include Interleukin 6 Receptor alpha ( IL-6R alpha ) Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) proteins protein synthesis response already observe PMNs isolate healthy adult . Furthermore , characterize expression activity mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) translational protein synthesis control pathway PMNs isolate preterm term infant compare result previous observation PMNs isolate adult . This pathway know regulate IL-6R alpha RAR alpha protein expression PMNs isolate adult . We also follow premature infant risk NEC clinically determine infant develop NEC risk factor may associate NEC population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many pediatric disease include Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) , sepsis , Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) neonatal Chronic Lung Disease ( CLD ) associate dysregulation acute inflammatory response [ 1 ] . So necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) . NEC , disease premature infant , afflict 10 % low birth weight infant . This disease often fatal [ 2 ] . Less significant nonetheless devastate sequelae include intestinal perforation , short gut syndrome , prolong total parenteral nutrition possible concomitant liver failure prolong intensive care unit stay . The etiology remain unknown , although risk factor prematurity , enteral feed , infection intestinal ischemia associate NEC [ 3 ] . The final common pathway NEC appear , least part , mediate biologically active phospholipid platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) . Each identify risk factor NEC increase serum level PAF premature infant [ 4 , 5 ] . Furthermore , serum level PAF-acetylhydrolase ( PAF-AH ) , enzyme responsible catabolize PAF , low premature infant compare term infant low term infant compare young child adult [ 6 , 7 ] . Although clinical trial PAF antagonist conduct premature human infant , various PAF antagonist prevent NEC-like clinical disease animal model [ 8-10 ] . Other data animal model suggest prominent role polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN ) pathogenesis NEC . Musemeche et al . induce NEC-like disease rat intra-aortic injection PAF [ 11 ] . They use vinblastine , chemotherapeutic agent side-effect profile significant induction neutropenia , induce neutropenia rat four day prior intra-aortic injection PAF . The vinblastine-induced neutropenia protective clinical pathologic manifestation NEC-like disease . Other investigator demonstrate increase PAF level gastrointestinal tract rat subject gut ischemia/reperfusion . The elevated level intestinal PAF show chemo attract prime PMNs [ 12 ] . The role human PMN acute inflammatory response well document . They play fundamental role non-specific immune response rapidly recruit area injury inflammation participate bacterial phagocytosis kill . Disorders associate deficiency impairment PMNs ( neutropenia , chronic granulomatous disease , leukocyte adhesion deficiency ) predispose infection gram-negative gram-positive bacteria [ 13 ] . However , regulation potent component acute inflammatory response imperative . Disorders ARDS , ischemia/reperfusion injury rheumatoid arthritis appear result dysregulation PMNs ' acute inflammatory response [ 1 ] . The molecular mechanism regulate PMNs ' response acute inflammation fully understood . In neutrophil priming , activation NADPH oxidase enzyme via receptor-mediated stimulation mediator fMLP PAF increasingly complex process involve various cellular secondary messenger Rho family GTPase Rac2 [ 14 , 15 ] . The mechanisms regulating PMN synthesis release pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 le well understood . The mechanisms regulating PMN apoptosis also well understood . In vitro vivo study indicate pro-inflammatory agent responsible prim human PMNs also affect longevity cell delay PMNs in-built capacity undergo apoptosis . In vitro study human PMNs show pro-inflammatory mediator like Granulocyte/Macrophage - Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) , Interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) , Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , Complement 5a ( C5a ) Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) inhibit PMN apoptosis , Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) Fas-ligand ( Fas-L ) accelerate rate neutrophil apoptosis [ 16 ] .</detailed_description>
