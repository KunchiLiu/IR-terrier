	<brief_summary>Despite remarkable gain treatment last decade short-term mortality survive hospital AT-elevation acute myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) remain high ( 5 % -10 % ) . Different study point reperfusion ( intravenous fibrinolysis percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) time critical decreasing STEMI patient ' mortality . Studies prehospital 12 lead electrocardiogram ( 12 lead PHECG ) advance emergency department ( ED ) notification suggest time treatment advantage intervention . The use 12 lead PHECG currently universal part standard treatment throughout province . The purpose study follow STEMI study subject standard treatment compare outcomes subject receive 12 lead PHECG advance ED notification mixed rural/urban area outcomes subject treat area 3 lead PHECG monitoring indirect ED notification . The investigator hypothesize survival benefit study subject 12 lead PHECG advance ED notification rural urban environment reduction door-to-reperfusion time 12 lead PHECG cost-saving technology province Ontario .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many study establish reperfusion reduces mortality ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patient ; early reperfusion therapy deliver , great mortality reduction . Most STEMI patient Ontario still receive reperfusion therapy within establish target time &lt; 30 minute fibrinolysis &lt; 90 minute PCI . 12 lead PHECG advance ED notification may time treatment impact STEMI patient . However study , investigate intervention small , largely urban trial , carry advanced care paramedic . In Ontario , many emergency medical service ( EMS ) system cover large rural region , frequently staff primary care paramedic basic life support training . Thus , benefit 12 lead PHECG setting unclear . In addition , study assess cost-effectiveness 12 lead PHECG compare 3 lead PHECG .</detailed_description>
