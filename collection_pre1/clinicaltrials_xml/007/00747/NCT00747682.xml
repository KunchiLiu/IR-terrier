	<detailed_description>Very low birth weight infant risk develop intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) . Post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus ( PPH ) major complication IVH contribute long-term developmental delay . Progressive PHH often require management ventricular dilation adjust CSF fluid volume . There 3 method employ acutely decrease CSF volume : 1 ) serial lumbar puncture , 2 ) open drain system ( continuous CSF removal ) , 3 ) reservoir system . Serial lumbar puncture effective communicating hydrocephalus . The open drain system infrequently use cumbersome relatively high risk infection . The method commonly use manage CSF volume reservoir system in-situ drain connect subcutaneous ( Omaya ) reservoir periodically aspirate needle puncture scalp . Because Omaya system close , intraventricular volume , thus , pressure must necessarily rise prior decrease CSF aspiration . Ventricular dilation control frequency volume CSF aspiration . When hydrocephalus continue problem despite removal CSF , ventricular-peritoneal ( VP ) shunt place . Approximately 50 % infant hydrocephalus treated removal CSF resolve hydrocephalus require VP shunt placement . Placement VP shunt difficult extremely preterm infant due increase risk ulceration around shunt site high protein concentration CSF occlude valve VP shunt require revision . Thus , hydrocephalus usually treat serial removal CSF allow identification infant 's whose hydrocephalus resolve time . However , time method CSF management controversial effect increase hydrocephalus cerebral perfusion , oxygenation , electrical activity , neuronal damage establish . Serial removal CSF cause change intracranial volume/pressure potentially transmit intracranial vessel . The caliber cerebral vessel may modify balance intravascular intracranial pressure , caliber change , blood flow characteristic also change . In cerebral vein capillary intraluminal pressure low , high intraventricular pressure may significantly affect blood flow cause venous stasis . NIRS measure cerebral oxygenation capillary vein . Intracranial artery arteriole may somewhat less affected , except intraventricular pressure greatly increase . The resultant decrease arterial supply affect tissue perfusion . Arterial flow measure Doppler ultrasonography . Thus , concern period increase fluctuate ventricular size cerebral arterial perfusion may compromise cerebral injury may result . Intracranial pressure influence plasticity/deformability immature brain easy expansibility cranial vault due presence suture open fontanelle . There indirect evidence experiment animal ventricular distention may cause secondary brain injury . Thus , axonal stretch disruption secondary progressive ventriculomegaly associate gliosis . Periventricular vascular distortion compression may decrease cerebral blood flow cause ischemic injury periventricular white matter . Inflammation repair may interfere CSF flow . Little research available help answer primary question involve clinical management ventricular dilation premature infant : Are relationships ventricular enlargement , cerebral perfusion , brain oxygen delivery , on-going cerebral damage ? Doppler ultrasonography apply premature infant characterize post delivery change arterial venous cerebral blood flow velocity . [ 1 ] Critically low superior vena cava flow measure Doppler ultrasonography first 24 hour life associate intraventricular hemorrhage premature infant bear 30 week gestation . [ 2 ] Using pulse Doppler ultrasonography , resistive index measure inversely relate blood flow . In old infant establish hydrocephalus , cerebral blood flow resistive index appear good indicator increase intracranial pressure . [ 3 ] However , review article , value Doppler indices alone predict increase intracranial pressure strongly question . [ 4 ] In recent article , resistive index anterior cerebral artery decrease significantly CSF drainage infant PHH . [ 5 ] Although Doppler ultrasonography easy perform , role detect significant change cerebral perfusion associate increase CSF volume ventricular dilation yet establish . Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) portable non-invasive technique use measure regional cerebral oxygen saturation cerebral blood . [ 6 ] NIRS use evaluate effect head [ 7 ] body position [ 8 ] cerebral hemodynamics preterm infant , effect certain treatment , surfactant administration [ 9 ] suction conventional high-frequency ventilation . [ 10 ] NIRS measurement cerebral oxygenation hemodynamics show impairment neonate risk develop severe brain ischemia . [ 11 ] In premature infant PHH , CSF fluid aspiration associate significant increase cerebral perfusion , cerebral blood volume , oxidative metabolism . [ 12,13 ] In small animal model acute hydrocephalus , NIRS measurement global cerebral blood flow use oxygen tracer highly correlated cerebral blood flow measure radioactive microspheres wide range increase intracranial pressure . [ 14 ] As intracranial pressure increase , NIRS measurement absolute measurement cerebral blood flow decrease . NIRS measure cerebral perfusion appear directly reflect absolute cerebral blood flow sensitive enough detect significant change cerebral perfusion occur evacuation CSF infant PHH . Amplitude-integrated EEG ( aEEG ) device use neurologic surveillance . The cortical electrical activity transform single signal represent overall electrocortical background activity brain . Specifically upper low voltage margin amplitude trace presence seizure activity evaluate . In addition , presence sleep-wake cycle , rhythmic sinusoidal variation amplitude , evaluate . Infants &gt; 34 week gestation predictable aEEG pattern . The signal depend gestational age postnatal age standard preterm infant report . [ 15,16 ] In case report , 2 preterm infant PHH demonstrate abnormal sleep-wake cycle markedly decrease cerebral electrical activity increase ventricular enlargement prior clinical sign increase intracranial pressure . In one infant , aEEG normalize VP shunt placement . [ 17 ] To date , clinical study effect aspiration CSF aEEG preterm infant PHH . Biomarkers cerebral injury use predict severity injury long-term outcome , identify patient early risk poor neurologic outcome , evaluate effectiveness therapeutic intervention . Neuronal specific enolase ( NSE ) , marker neuronal damage , S100B , secrete astrocyte marker glial/neuronal injury , show increased child traumatic brain injury . [ 18 ] In preterm infant PHH , S100B glial fibrillary acid protein ( GFAP ) , structural protein astrocyte , significantly elevate infant brain parenchymal lesion poor neurological outcome . [ 19 ] These biomarkers quickly metabolize thus ongoing elevation would indicate ongoing damage . Transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-ß ) , produce fibroblast release CSF injury , stimulate production extracellular protein could result PHH due permanent obstruction CSF flow . [ 20 ] Cytokine IL-6 marker inflammation . There longitudinal study effect aspiration CSF markers cerebral damage preterm infant PHH .</detailed_description>
