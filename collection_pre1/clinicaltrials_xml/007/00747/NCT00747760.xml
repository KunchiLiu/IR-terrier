	<brief_title>TSH Receptor Mutations Among Consanguineous Community</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resistance thyrotropin ( RTSH ) syndrome involve reduce sensitivity TSH . It characterize elevated TSH , absence goiter ( normal hypoplastic thyroid gland ) normal low level thyroid hormone . The TSH-receptor ( TSHR ) gene locate chromosome 14q31 consist extracellular , trans-membrane intracellular domain . Mutation TSHR may cause either gain loss function receptor . Loss-of-function mutation autosomal-recessively inherited lead spectrum phenotype , range mild euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia severe congenital hypothyroidism ( CH ) . Insensitivity TSH depend severity location TSHR mutation . Since first report familial euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia cause TSHR mutation , several case loss-of-function mutation TSHR report however report outcome patient affected TSHR mutation . Whether condition euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia lead clinical hypothyroidism , remain stable normalizes time yet elucidate . We recently describe unique novel TSHR-inactivating mutation locate third extracellular loop preferentially affect inositol phosphate ( IP ) pathway three sister Arab-Muslim decent present euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia . Further analysis extend family reveal additional member TSHR syndrome phenotype carry two different TSHR mutation . All affected subject live town . The aim present study evaluate clinical course time , genotype-phenotype association frequency two different TSHR mutation among highly consanguineous population town Um El Fahem .</detailed_description>
