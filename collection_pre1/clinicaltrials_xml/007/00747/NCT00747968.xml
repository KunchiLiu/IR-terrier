	<brief_title>The Effect GLP-1 Analogue Exenatide Type 2 Diabetes CNS Heart During Hyperglycemia Assessed PET</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) epidemically increase throughout world . T2D frequently associate multiple complication , particularly macrovascular complication form myocardial infarction possible complication death heart failure , cerebral infarction limb amputation responsible vast increase morbidity mortality group patient . Apart individual burden patient , T2D put massive pressure national health economy . It well establish blood glucose lower drug , antihypertensive well lipid lower drug play pivotal role treatment type 2 diabetic subject . Regarding glycemia , frequently side effect 'classic ' drug hypoglycemia , weight gain , heart failure , forth . Another important caveat employ anti-hyperglycemic drug either monotherapy combination lower blood glucose target define ADA . In word novel anti-diabetic drug urgently require . However , incretin concept recently inaugurate pharmacological scenario . Glucagon-like peptide-1-receptors ( GLP-1R ) abundant alpha- beta-cells pancreas , also present heart CNS , especially hypothalamic hippocampal region . A wide range extrapancreatic effect GLP-1 observe slow gastric empty satiety-stimulating effect hypothalamic mechanism . Recent study show interesting result regard protection heart ischemia , protection brain acute phase stroke propose . Over-all GLP-1 seem display effect heart , brain , vessel , kidney , muscle liver ( 7 ) . To knowledge , group recent study first , sophisticated metabolic technique , together Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) , demonstrate GLP-1 per se reduces cerebral glucose transport total cerebral grey matter well individual grey matter region , thereby suggest GLP-1 may protect brain limiting intracerebral glucose fluctuation plasma glucose increase . In word , GLP-1 regulate blood brain barrier ( BBB ) glucose transfer normal glycemia presumably also hyperglycemia ( 19 ) . GLP-1 believe cardioprotective action . A recent study show improved preservation cardiac function patient acute myocardial infarction GLP-1-infusion supplement conventional treatment compare conventional treatment alone . Ejection fraction improve 10 % diabetic non-diabetic patient ( 15 ) GLP-1 group . It show animal model research-team extend myocardial injury small coronary occlusion treat GLP-1 ( 16 ) . Glucagon-like-peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) T2D characterize several hormonal metabolic abnormality dysfunction insulin secretion , glucagon excess , impaired Glucagon-like-peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) secretion , insulin resistance . GLP-1 incretin hormone numerous documented effect glycemic response . It one potent insulinotropic agent know secrete L-cells gut mucosa response food ingestion . Effects islet-cells ( I ) Amplification glucose dependent stimulation insulin secretion ( II ) Inhibition glucagon secretion . In animal cellular study GLP-1 stimulate β-cell neogenesis , growth differentiation , vitro inhibition β-cell apoptosis observe . Thus GLP-1 also β-cell growth factor . For , treatment GLP-1 seldom cause hypoglycaemia type 2 diabetic patient . Hypotheses Based finding above-mentioned study , hypothesize GLP-1-analogue exenatide hyperglycemia protect brain type 2 diabetic patient hyperglycemia reduce blood-brain-barrier glucose transport brain glucose metabolism . We also hypothesize exenatide similar fashion reduction cardiac glucose uptake metabolism stabilize cardiac glucose fluctuation , theoretically protect cardiac tissue toxicity hyperglycemia . Aim With well establish methodology , compare effect GLP-1-analogue exenatide placebo , respectively , consumption glucose CNS heart assess uptake 18-fluro-deoxy-glucose ( FDG ) monitor PET-scan type-2 diabetic patient hyperglycemic pituitary-pancreatic clamp perspective future prevention macrovascular complication diabetes possibly diseases Alzheimer 's disease neurodegenerative cardiac disease . The project comprise two separate substudies focus effect exenatide CNS heart , respectively . Accordingly , substudy primary endpoint : 1 ) glucose-uptake brain 2 ) glucose-uptake heart . Design Randomized , double-blinded crossover design . Every participant CNS-PET-scanned twice heart-PET-scanned twice random order GLP-1 placebo-infusions interrupt 4 week wash-out period study day . The study perform similarly previously conduct FDG/PET-study ( 21 ) pancreatic clamp do Nielsen et al . ( 22 ) Methods GLP-1 natural peptide hormone degrade enzyme DPPIV minute circulation . In study use GLP-1 analogue exenatide slow degradable peptide due resistance towards DPPIV . The remain hormone utilized study , use tool investigational design use medical compound . Hormone dose - Somatostatin ( Ferring ) 300 μg/hour ( 22 ) - Insulin Actrapid ( NOVO Nordisk ) 1,0 mU/kg/minute ( 0-60 min . ) ( 22 ) - Insulin Actrapid ( NOVO Nordisk ) 0,3 mU/kg/minute ( 60min - ) ( 22 ) - Glucagon ( NOVO Nordisk , Glucagen ) 0.6 ng/kg/minute ( 22 ) - Growth hormone ( NOVO Nordisk ) 2 ng/kg/minute ( 22 ) - GLP-1-analogue , Exenatide ( Eli Lilly/Amylin Pharmaceuticals ) 0.066 pmol*kg-1*min-1 ( 23 ) Pancreatic hyperglycemic clamp Somatostatin administer inhibit endogenous production GLP-1 , insulin , glucagon , growth hormone . Insulin , glucagon , growth hormone administer achieve basal hormone level . 20 % glucose infused achieve hyperglycemic clamp plasma glucose 9 mM experience high level hyperglycemia possible still avoid breakthrough natural counterregulatory hormone . Ethics Apart document effect glycemic control , GLP-1 potential protective impact heart brain . Patients type-2 diabetes carry significantly increase risk ischemic heart disease stroke substantially reduce current treatment . Preliminary data suggest clinical use GLP-1 GLP-1 analogue lead improved prophylaxis late diabetic complication , achieve patient group addition improve glycemic control . We believe current study provide deep insight extra-pancreatic effect GLP-1 , particular aim develop efficient prophylaxis late diabetic cerebrovascular cardiovascular complication , outweighs know adverse effect element study .
