	<detailed_description>S100B low molecular weight calcium bind protein find predominantly central nervous system , specifically astroglial cell . [ 1 ] S100B play role calcium-dependent information processing intracellular involve regulation cytoskeleton cell morphology . [ 1 ] S100B secrete astrocyte exhibit dose dependent extracellular cytokine function . In tissue culture nanomolar concentration , S100B stimulate neuronal growth , development , regeneration protects degeneration . At micromolar concentration , S100B neurotoxic [ 2 ] stimulates apoptosis potentially interaction RAGE receptor , induction NO synthase , caspase cascade . Thus , markedly elevate concentration S100B , release damage astrocyte , may propagate neuronal death . To support hypothesis , expression S100B present wobble mouse , animal model neuronal degeneration . [ 3 ] S100B also increase brain patient Alzheimer 's disease [ 1 ] amniotic fluid fetus [ 4 ] brain patient Down 's syndrome . [ 1 ] S100B release damage astroglial cell may indirectly reflect neuronal damage . [ 5,6 ] S100B elevate cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) adult patient within 48 hour infarction remain elevate least 7 day event . [ 6 ] S100B also elevate CSF first 3 day traumatic brain injury [ 7 ] subarachnoid hemorrhage . [ 8 ] S100B readily cross dysfunctional blood-brain barrier serum concentration S100B significantly increase adult patient traumatic brain injury [ 9 ] , stroke [ 10 ] , cardiac arrest . [ 5 ] Serum S100B rise 2-4 day brain trauma infarct concentration correlate size damage identify CT scan . [ 9,10 ] For patient traumatic brain injury , elevate concentration S100B note admission significantly predict development increase intracranial pressure 4-5 day later . [ 9 ] After cardiac arrest , serum S100B concentration statistically elevate 30 minute initiation CPR continue significantly elevate patient later exhibit brain damage CT scan neurological exam . [ 5 ] This significant elevation serum S100B last least 7 day . In addition , serum S100B concentration correlate morbidity [ 9 ] neurological outcome . [ 10 ] While t1/2 S100B ~2 hour adult , persistent increase concentration S100B serum indicate continuous release damage cell . S100B show differentially distribute different cortical region brain fetal development increase concentration gestation , support role development maturation CNS . [ 11 ] It postulate early development , S100B lead glial cell proliferation later lead extension neurites , regulation fiber sprouting , formation/maintenance synapsis , maturation glial cell . [ 1 ] Cord blood concentration S100B show inversely related gestational age 27 42 week gestation . [ 12 ] Thirty term infant ( 37-42 week ) cord blood S100B level &lt; 1 ug/L 28 preterm infant ( 27-36 week ) cord blood level 0.5 2.7 ug/L . Higher serum concentration S100B may due lack integrity blood-brain barrier preterm infant conjunction increase secretion S100B astroglial cell . Due low molecular weight ( 10.5 kD ) high degree solubility , S100B excrete kidney . It detect first void urine infant 26-42 week gestation preterm infant exhibit high concentration S100B ( 3.17 ug/L ) . [ 13 ] Urine S100B concentration detection limit assay ( 0.02 ug/L ) term infant . There significant negative correlation S100B concentration urine gestational age ( r=-.79 , p &lt; 0.001 ) , data show . Only 23 preterm infant ( gestational age 26-36 week ) enrol study average gestational age state . Previous study laboratory demonstrate urine S100B concentration significantly vary 23-28 week gestation . { spr } Infants CNS injury increase CSF , serum , urine concentration S100B . In asphyxiated term infant later develop intracranial hemorrhage , S100B show elevate 12 hour birth compare asphyxiated term infant develop intracranial pathology control term infant . [ 14 ] In another report , asphyxiated term infant , 3 month exhibit abnormal neurologic outcome death , markedly elevate S100B level 12-24 hour birth . [ 15 ] However , study limit small number patient . Serum concentration S100B also significantly elevate ( 2.9 ug/L ) 8 term infant 3 day initiate ECMO therapy . Daily cranial ultrasound evaluation identify intracranial hemorrhage infant day 5-6 . In word , significant elevation serum concentration S100B occur least 2-3 day prior ultrasound evidence intracranial hemorrhage . Eight control infant , also receive ECMO therapy , ultrasonic evidence intracranial hemorrhage change S100B baseline ( 0.5 ug/L ) . [ 16 ] The common CNS trauma preterm infant intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) . [ 17 ] IVH originate microcirculation/capillary network germinal matrix . Altered cerebral blood flow secondary poor cerebral autoregulation systemic hypo- hypertension , platelet coagulation disturbance see infection , decrease capillary integrity vascular support implicate pathogenesis IVH . IVH grade ( 1-4 ) extent hemorrhage see ultrasound . In grade I IVH , blood confine germinal matrix . In Grade II IVH , blood present germinal matrix small blood present ventricle . Grade III IVH occur ventricle fill blood dilate . In Grade IV IVH , blood extends brain parenchyma due venous congestion terminal vein border lateral ventricle lead white matter necrosis . Grades I II IVH associate increase developmental abnormality , insure normalcy . Grades III IV IVH ( severe IVH ) highly associate developmental delay , specifically spastic hemiplegia affect low extremity upper extremity due proximity hemorrhage descend motor fiber , may also affect intellect . IVH , mild ( grade 1-2 ) severe ( grade 3-4 ) rarely see infant gestational age &gt; 28 week due developmental involution vessel germinal matrix source hemorrhage . [ 17 ] S100B elevate CSF , serum urine preterm infant IVH . S100B elevate CSF preterm infant IVH posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation subsequent neurologic disability 12 month age . [ 18 ] The timing ventricular tap specify uniform correlation IVH serum concentration S100B determine . Serum concentration S100B increase preterm infant ( mean gestational age 35 week ) IVH ( grade 1-4 ) compare preterm infant without IVH . [ 19 ] In study , high serum level S100B ( 5 ug/L ) note infant die . However , study complicate small number patient ( 11 IVH 14 control infant ) , nonspecified range gestational age , non-uniform blood sampling time ( within first 48 hour birth ) , grade 1 IVH see 50 % infant . Urine concentration S100B preterm infant ( 29-35 week ) IVH ( grade 2-4 ) elevate birth continue increase subsequent 3 day compare control preterm infant . [ 20 ] The severity IVH significantly correlate level S100B urine . The high level S100B see five infant die . Previous study laboratory demonstrate urine concentration S100B elevate infant gestational age 23-28 week severe ( grade 3 4 IVH ) compare control infant grade 1 IVH day 1 . ( SPR ) An important limitation cite study insufficient number neonate study allow correlation gestational age presence severe IVH either urine serum S100B concentration . Most importantly , study involve preterm infant whose gestational age &gt; 27 week gestation . Severe IVH ( grade 3-4 ) rarely see infant &gt; 28 week gestation . In addition , report date adult , child , infant define relationship urine serum concentration S100B . Furthermore , report clearly establish baseline S100B concentration infant gestational age &lt; 28 week . The specific aim study state . If S100B concentration significantly increase infant severe IVH , S100B concentration may predict infant highly likely develop severe IVH ensue significant morbidity mortality allow early initiation treatment decrease extension intracranial damage .</detailed_description>
