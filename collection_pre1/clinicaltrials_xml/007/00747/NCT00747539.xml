	<brief_title>Brain Deficits HIV/HCV Coinfected People Before After Anti-HCV Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization estimate least 3 % world 's population infect chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , one third HIV infect people coinfected HCV . HCV damage liver cell cause liver disease cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . People infect HCV also suffer neurocognitive deficit , include problem information processing , slow muscular process related thinking , difficulty focus complex thing . These neurocognitive deficit similar find HIV infected individual , previous research indicate people infected HIV HCV great overall cognitive impairment . This study aim determine impact anti-HCV treatment neurocognitive , neuropsychiatric , neuroimaging factor people infected HCV people coinfected HCV HIV . The study also aim measure whether possible neurocognitive improvement anti-HCV treatment related physical health outcome , measure sustain virologic response , whether adherence medication schedule lay participant influence possible positive effect either neurocognitive physical health . Two kind participant recruit study : infect HCV infect HCV HIV . These two group compare determine comorbid HCV HIV infection affect treatment outcome . The treatment specify HCV pegylated interferon alfa ribavirin ( PEG-IFN/RBV ) , consider standard care patient chronic HCV . Participants continue see doctor regularly schedule , prescribed medication advice concern HCV treatment note researcher . All participant test baseline , 12 week treatment , 12 week completion treatment . A subset group participant undergo additional neuroimaging test . Participation study last varied amount time depend recommend treatment HCV . Based virus ' genotype rapid virologic response , treatment period HCV may last 24 48 week , extension 12 24 week case . During three test session , last 5 hour , participant ' health , cognitive functioning , medication adherence measure . Testing include self-report measure , intelligence test , task design assess cognitive functioning , motor functioning task . Urine test screen narcotic also collect . In addition self-report measure , cap pill bottle store HCV medication automatically record every time cap remove measure adherence medication schedule .</detailed_description>
