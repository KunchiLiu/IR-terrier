	<brief_summary>S100B , calcium-binding protein , find predominantly central nervous system ( CNS ) increase CSF blood CNS injury . There two objective study . 1 ) To complement previous study , urine S100B concentration correlate gestational age infant bear &gt; 28 week gestation first week life ? 2 ) Is urine concentration S100B affect intracranial pathology gestational age range ? Elevation urine concentration S100B may indicator infant develop serious intracranial pathology may allow early initiation treatment potentially decrease morbidity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>S100B low molecular weight calcium bind protein find predominantly central nervous system ( CNS ) , specifically astroglial cell . [ 1 ] S100B play role calcium-dependent information processing intracellulary involve regulation cytoskeleton cell morphology . [ 1 ] S100B secrete astrocyte exhibit dose dependent extracellular cytokine function . In tissue culture nanomolar concentration , S100B stimulate neuronal growth , development , regeneration protects degeneration . At micromolar concentration , S100B neurotoxic [ 2 ] stimulates apoptosis potentially interaction RAGE receptor , induction NO synthase , caspase cascade . The evidence support S100B 's role development maturation CNS S100B differentially distribute different cortical region brain fetal development increase concentration gestation . [ 3 ] It postulate early development , S100B stimulate glial cell proliferation later lead extension neurites , regulation fiber sprouting , formation/maintenance synapsis , maturation glial cell . [ 1 ] Cord blood concentration S100B show inversely related gestational age 27 42 week gestation . [ 4 ] Thirty term infant ( 37-42 week ) mean cord blood S100B concentration 0.47 ug/L ( range 0-1.5ug/L ) 28 preterm infant ( 27-36 week ) mean cord blood concentration 1.14ug/L ( range 0.5 2.7 ug/L ) . Higher serum concentration S100B preterm infant may due physiologic increase note development and/or lack integrity blood-brain barrier . S100B release damage astroglial cell may reflect neuronal damage . [ 5,6 ] Concentration S100B elevate cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) adult patient within 48 hour infarction remain elevate least 7 day event . [ 6 ] S100B also elevate CSF first 3 day traumatic brain injury [ 7 ] subarachnoid hemorrhage . [ 8 ] Due low molecular weight , S100B readily cross dysfunctional blood-brain barrier serum concentration S100B significantly increase adult patient traumatic brain injury [ 9 ] , stroke [ 10 ] , cardiac arrest . [ 5 ] Serum S100B rise 2-4 day brain trauma infarct concentration correlate size damage identify CT scan . [ 9,10 ] After cardiac arrest , serum S100B concentration statistically elevate 30 minute initiation CPR continue significantly elevate patient later exhibit brain damage CT scan neurological exam . [ 5 ] This significant elevation serum S100B last least 7 day . In addition , serum S100B concentration correlate morbidity [ 9 ] neurological outcome . [ 10 ] While t1/2 S100B ~2 hour adult , persistently increase concentration S100B serum indicate continuous release damage cell . The common CNS trauma preterm infant intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) . [ 11 ] IVH originate microcirculation/capillary network germinal matrix . Altered cerebral blood flow secondary poor cerebral autoregulation systemic hypo- hypertension , platelet coagulation disturbance , infection , decrease capillary integrity vascular support implicate pathogenesis IVH . IVH grade ( 1-4 ) extent hemorrhage see ultrasound . In grade I IVH , blood confine germinal matrix . In Grade II IVH , blood present germinal matrix small blood present ventricle . Grade III IVH occur ventricle fill blood dilate . In Grade IV IVH , blood extends brain parenchyma due venous congestion terminal vein border lateral ventricle lead white matter necrosis . Grades I II IVH associate increase developmental abnormality , insure normalcy . Grades III IV IVH ( severe IVH ) highly associate developmental delay , specifically spastic hemiplegia affect low extremity upper extremity due proximity hemorrhage descend motor fiber , may also affect intellect . IVH , mild ( grade 1-2 ) severe ( grade 3-4 ) rarely see infant gestational age &gt; 28 week due developmental involution vessel germinal matrix source hemorrhage . [ 11 ] Due low molecular weight ( 10.5 kD ) high degree solubility , S100B excrete kidney . It detect first void urine infant 26-42 week gestation preterm infant exhibit high concentration S100B ( 3.17 ug/L ) . [ 12 ] Mean urine S100B concentration term infant ( n=60 ) 0.07 ug/L . This study confound mention intracranial pathology , insufficient number preterm infant , actual data show . In another study , S100B elevate urine preterm infant ( 29-35 week gestation ) IVH ( grade 2-4 ) birth continue increase subsequent 3 day compare control preterm infant . [ 13 ] The severity IVH significantly correlate concentration S100B urine . The high level S100B see five infant die . An important limitation cite study insufficient patient enrollment allow correlation gestational age presence severe IVH urine S100B concentration . Recently , show urine concentration S100B elevate preterm infant ( 23-28 week gestation ) without intracranial pathology . [ pas abstract ] However , preterm infant severe IVH ( grade 3-4 ) significantly elevate urine concentration S100B day 1 . [ 14 ] The specific aim study establish baseline S100B concentration urine infant gestational age &gt; 28 week . In addition , impact intracranial pathology , IVH preterm infant , investigate . In previous study , infant develop necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) extremely high level S100B first week life . NEC affect preterm infant , mostly 26-32 week gestation , result death markedly increase complication prolonged length stay . Secondary analysis infant study investigate development NEC significantly associate high concentration S100B urine . If true , one theory explain find infant develop NEC event around time birth cause decrease intestinal perfusion allow increased susceptibility development NEC .</detailed_description>
