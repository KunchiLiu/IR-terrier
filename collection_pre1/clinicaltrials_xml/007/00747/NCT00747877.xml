	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Giving chemotherapy bortezomib peripheral stem cell transplant stop growth cancer cell stop divide kill . Giving colony-stimulating factor , G-CSF , certain chemotherapy drug , help stem cell move bone marrow blood collect store . Chemotherapy give prepare bone marrow stem cell transplant . The stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy bortezomib . It yet know whether high-dose melphalan give together second stem cell transplant effective low-dose cyclophosphamide treat patient relapsed multiple myeloma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give high-dose melphalan together second stem cell transplant see well work compare low-dose cyclophosphamide treat patient relapsed multiple myeloma chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine effect freedom disease progression patient relapse multiple myeloma treat re-induction therapy comprise bortezomib , doxorubicin hydrochloride , dexamethasone ( PAD ) follow second autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) high-dose melphalan v low-dose cyclophosphamide consolidation therapy . Secondary - To assess response rate PAD patient follow previous autograft . - To compare overall response rate patient follow high-dose melphalan chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation low-dose cyclophosphamide consolidation therapy . - To assess overall survival patient treat regimen . - To assess safety toxicity second ASCT patient . - To assess safety toxicity PAD patient . - To assess feasibility stem cell collection follow PAD patient . - To determine impact regimen pain quality life patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Re-induction ( PAD ) therapy : Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously day 1-4 , oral dexamethasone day 1-4 ( day 8-11 15-18 course 1 ) . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) mobilization harvest : Within 6-12 week , patient receive cyclophosphamide IV day 0 filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) begin day 1 continue time PBSC harvest . PBSCs collect . Patients successfully complete re-induction therapy adequate PBSC mobilization stratify accord length first remission plateau ( ≤ v ≥ 24 month ) response PAD re-induction therapy ( stable disease v ≥ partial response ) . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I ( high-dose melphalan consolidation therapy ) : Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV day -1 follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) day 0 . - Arm II ( low-dose cyclophosphamide consolidation therapy ) : Patients receive low-dose cyclophosphamide IV orally week 12-20 week total 12 course . Patients complete EORTC QLQ-C30 EORTC QLQ-MY20 , Brief Pain Inventory Short Form ( BPI-SF ) , Leeds Assessment Neuropathic Symptoms Signs ( Self Assessment ) Pain Scale ( S-LANSS ) questionnaires baseline completion re-induction therapy . Patients follow monthly 100 day ASCT 30 day low-dose cyclophosphamide every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
