The Centers Disease Control Prevention 's ( CDC 's ) Replicating Effective Programs ( REP ) project systematic method replicate effective behavioral intervention reduce HIV risk . The REP three component : - Packaging , adapt , behavioral treatment scientific protocols nontechnical , user-friendly language - Providing formal training health care professional implement package - Supporting use package technical assistance available individual treatment sit The REP framework effective extend availability HIV behavioral intervention ensure proper implementation , never use non-HIV-related intervention , proven wide availability new intervention improve patient health quality life .
