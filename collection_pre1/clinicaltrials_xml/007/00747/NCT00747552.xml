	<brief_summary>The observational study design determine feasibility perform Intra-Abdominal Pressure ( IAP ) via bladder pressure measurement track IAP neonate require bladder catheterization . Correlation IAP measurement clinical status neonatal abdomen help determine threshold value Intra-Abdominal Hypertension ( IAH ) neonate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An increasingly common cause Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome ( MODS ) mechanical injury/ischemia cause elevated pressure within abdominal cavity . This phenomenon term intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) final pathway multiple organ dysfunction failure term abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) . In neonate , IAH know accompany omphalocele , gastroschisis diaphragmatic hernia repair . IAH also find cause need neonatal extra corporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) and/or subsequent failure ECMO treatment . While abdominal compartment syndrome final physiologic clinically apparent expression severe elevation intra-abdominal pressure , early course process , significant organ dysfunction occur sub-clinical level . If mild moderately elevated abdominal pressure detect early , may allow clinician intervene early reverse process , prevent progression ACS possibly reduce morbidity mortality . To date study investigate correlation bladder pressure ( surrogate measure IAP ) neonate may may ACS . Thus , range normal elevated IAP determine . There suggestion pediatric ICU patient threshold IAH child less adult . Likewise , threshold IAH neonate may expect even low , remain determined . In study , IAP ( via bladder pressure measurement ) measure commercially available FDA approve system utilizes electronic pressure transducer , tube , bedside patient monitor pressure measurement input . These type monitor standard NICU . The pressure transducer attach bladder catheter via two-way valve , allow urine drainage in-between take bladder pressure measurement . A small amount sterile saline infuse bladder order make IAP measurement . While indwell urinary catheter , bladder pressure measurement take every 2-4 hour .</detailed_description>
