	<brief_summary>This study evaluate new assessment tool equipment new way use exist tool equipment NIH Clinical Center Rehabilitation Medicine Department order maximize patient function . The Department assess treat NIH patient chronic pain , problem walk get around , activity daily live , perform task need job hobby , communicate chew swallow . Children adults age disability healthy normal volunteer may eligible study . The following kind assessment evaluate study : Assessments Impairments Impairments problem loss movement , weakness loss sensation . Assessments may include measurement range motion , strength , sensation , pain , joint stability mobility , joint angle , limb girth , gait , exercise tolerance , stamen , ultrasound image muscle swallow function . Assessments Function Performance Functional performance assessment look well subject perform action , walk get around , dress , prepare meal . They may include evaluation activity daily live , leisure activity , fatigue , vocational activity , school activity , cop skill , quality life . The assessment may do questionnaire interview watch subject perform activity . Assessments Treatment Techniques Treatment technique assess evaluate method equipment use treat patient impairment problem function . They may evaluate , example , use heat , cold , strengthen exercise , fitness exercise , TENS unit , splint orthotics , shoe modification .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The objective protocol provide framework clinician Department Rehabilitation Medicine ( RMD ) serve clinical need patient intramural clinical research need NIH investigator maintain state art expertise functional assessment person disability investigate new equipment , methodology and/or technique functional assessment . Study Population We intend study total 500 healthy volunteer 500 subject disability , include enrol NIH intramural research protocol . Design The study consist individual project design design RMD staff include one associate investigator . The individual project relatively small design test reliability , reproducibility , efficiency , feasibility , sensitivity , specificity , tolerability , validity and/or precision physical medicine rehabilitation assessment equipment , device clinical evaluation impairment , disability , and/or function . Outcome Measures The specific outcome measure ( ) choose meet goal individual project generally include one following : i. Subjective assessment participant test , device , evaluation base write evaluation tool . ii . Comparisons establish evaluation equipment design ass similar area function , include concurrent validity analysis . iii . Subjective assessment clinician use test , device evaluation , base write evaluation tool . iv . Feasibility assessment , include time required participant perform test , time clinician evaluate result test , and/or prepare report result test . v. Assessments reliability and/or stability technique use , include statistical test coefficient variability . vi . Assessments tolerance test , include measure vital sign element physical examination .</detailed_description>
