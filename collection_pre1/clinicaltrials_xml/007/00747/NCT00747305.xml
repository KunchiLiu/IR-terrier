	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sunitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving sunitinib surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well sunitinib work give surgery treat patient metastatic kidney cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Before After Surgery Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To describe gene expression VEGF non-VEGF angiogenic growth factor gene kidney cancer specimens patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma treat sunitinib malate . - To describe association quantitative gene expression level VEGF non-VEGF angiogenic factor clinical efficacy drug , measure response , duration response , time progression patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily 8 week . Within 2 week completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy , patient undergo nephrectomy evaluation response therapy . Beginning 4-8 week surgery patient resume oral sunitinib malate daily 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression 8 week adjuvant treatment receive treatment study agent . Viable ( non-necrotic ) tumor non-tumor kidney tissue sample obtain time nephrectomy correlative biomarker study . Tissue sample analyze gene expression VEGF non-VEGF angiogenic factor real-time RT-PCR , western blot , and/or IHC . Blood sample obtain baseline 4 8 week evaluation circulating level VEGF select chemokines . After completion study therapy , patient follow monthly .</detailed_description>
