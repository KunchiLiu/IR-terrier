	<brief_summary>Meningitis septicaemia ( blood poisoning ) cause group B meningococcal infection ( MenB ) important cause death disability UK . Prevention vaccination therefore remain key public health priority . Research national `` meningitis '' vaccine programme MenC , Hib Streptococcus pneumoniae show u success part due ability protect vaccinate unvaccinated , so−called herd immunity . This protection probably occur reduce carriage meningitis bacteria back throat ( mucosal immunity ) . How happen poorly understood research show naturally acquire immunity ( transient contact immune system meningococcus back throat without cause disease ) may impact process . We believe develop MenB vaccine able cause mucosal immunity prevent MenB carriage , important understand interaction natural immunity vaccination . In study propose administer MenB vaccine adult order investigate process . Our finding provide important insight Men B immunity , inform design novel vaccine strategy allow rational test new vaccine become available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Meningitis septicaemia ( blood poisoning ) cause group B meningococcal infection ( MenB ) important cause death disability UK . Our research show naturally acquire mucosal immunity ( transient contact immune system meningococcus back throat without cause disease ) may impact ability new Men B vaccine protect vaccinate unvaccinated , call herd immunity . We ask question , specialise immune cell call CD25+ regulatory T cell ( Treg ) operate back throat explain failure immunisation boost mucosal T cell immunity teenager young adult ? PURPOSE &amp; OBJECTIVES : MenB common cause bacterial meningitis UK , frequent cause septicaemia child young adult . Death may occur 20 % individual long term sequela frequent amongst survive . In contrast highly successful MenC vaccine programme , burden MenB disease remain considerable . Prevention vaccination therefore key public health priority UK . This project inform development broadly protective MenB vaccine . We propose : 1 ) Determine nature mucosal CD25+ Treg population regulate MenB immunity . 2 ) Establish whether naturally induce mucosal CD25+ Treg activity adult adolescent modulates mucosal immune response systemic MenB OMV vaccination . 3 ) Investigate impact regulation mucosal B cell memory DESIGN : This phase II , open label , randomise , single centre study MenB vaccine utilise cell isolated human tonsil measure vaccine−induced T cell immune response MenB adult adolescent . Comparisons make control unvaccinated population . RECRUITMENT : Ear , Nose Throat surgeon approach agree participation patient study . Subjects invited letter express interest study . Interested individual contact study medic provide appropriate subject information sheet . All study visit clinical procedure undertaken University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust , Bristol . Study clinical personnel obtain write informed consent participation subject . No study procedure undertaken write informed consent give . Following confirmation inclusion exclusion criterion , subject enrol study . RANDOMISATION : On inclusion study , subject allocate next available subject number . Subjects enrol study assign 5−digit subject number . The first two digit identify study site . The next three digit identify subject within site assign sequentially , 001 correspond first subject enrol . The subject number determine treatment group subject randomise accord computer−generated block randomisation procedure . INCLUSION / EXCLUSION : Individuals eligible enrol study male female subject . The eligibility subject take part study assess dedicate Vaccine Study doctor nurse prior enrolment . Inclusion criterion : - write informed consent agreement sample send overseas - adult adolescents 16−40 year schedule undergo routine tonsillectomy - good health time entry study determine medical history , physical examination clinical judgment investigator - availability visit schedule study Exclusion criterion : - tonsillectomy allergic condition - receipt intent immunize vaccination ( influenza vaccine post−exposure tetanus vaccination ) investigational agent within 50 day prior enrolment throughout study period - previous receipt MenB vaccine - chronic administration ( defined 14 day ) immunosuppressant immune−modifying drug ( Inhaled topical steroid allow . ) - history confirm suspected meningococcal infection close contact individual culture PCR proven N. meningitidis serogroup B within previous 60 day - pregnancy ( plan become pregnant study ) * breast feeding - take unwilling take sufficient measure avoid pregnancy occur duration study period** - chronic progressive disease ( eg neoplasm , cardiac , respiratory , liver , gastrointestinal , renal , neurological disease , autoimmune disease , blood dyscrasia diathesis ) history dependence/abuse drug alcohol • confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection - administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product last year plan administration study period - history anaphylactic shock , asthma , urticaria allergic reaction previous vaccination , know hypersensitivity vaccine component - fever ( oral temperature equal great 38.5°C ) within past 24 hour significant acute chronic infection within previous 7 day - significant acute chronic infection require systemic antibiotic treatment within past 14 day - available visit schedule study period - condition , opinion investigator , might interfere evaluation study objectives - participation another clinical trial within last 90 day plan study - A pregnancy test ( urine ) schedule day vaccination require female wish participate study well give basic menstrual cycle information cover period individual may pregnant would ascertain chemical test . - Females childbearing age use plan use acceptable birth control measure duration study . Oral , inject implanted hormonal contraceptive , diaphragm condom spermicidal agent intrauterine device consider acceptable form birth control . If sexually active subject use one accepted birth control method least two month prior study entry .</detailed_description>
