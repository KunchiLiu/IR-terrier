	<brief_title>Study Higher Dose Rituxan Versus Standard Doses Rituxan With Cyclophosphamide , Vincristine , Prednisone Subjects With Chronic ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale use chemotherapy combination Rituximab : Since Rituximab anti-B cell therapy , order improve rate durable response beyond 32 % ( 18 57 ) see Rituximab alone , seem appropriate combine therapy would also target T cell and/or macrophage . Our plan therefore combine Rituximab standard chemotherapy ( CHOP ) -like regimen previously successfully test patient follicular diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas 13-15 . The `` CHOP '' chemotherapy regimen combination cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine prednisone ( prednisolone ) consider `` gold standard '' treat lymphoma 20 year . This combination medication use Hodgkin 's patient refractory ITP become template developing use cyclophosphamide , vincristine , prednisone ITP initially report 1993 . Since report doxorubicin efficacy ITP anecdotal 16 drug potential cardiac toxicity , CVP regimen ( namely combination cyclophosphamide + vincristine prednisone ) similar efficacy CHOP patient ITP less toxicity . Indeed , efficacy chemotherapy12 well pulse cyclophosphamide therapy alone11 already report patient refractory ITP . Since attempts increase efficacy CHOP increase dos add cytotoxic drug fail , new therapeutic strategy combine CHOP Rituxan successfully develop last year various type B-cell lymphoma 13-15 . In elderly patient diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma , addition Rituxan standard CHOP chemotherapy significantly reduce risk treatment failure death without increase toxicity 13 . Moreover , autoimmune disorder , preliminary data suggest Rituxan cyclophopshamide give combination could effective relatively safe patient active rheumatoid arthritis 17 . Therefore , rationale combine Rituxan CHOP-like regimen ITP threefold : Both Rituxan CHOP IV cyclophosphamide efficacy ITP The treatment different mechanisms action . They minimally-overlapping toxicity . The rationale use high dos Rituxan patient response , relapse , drug standard dose : The standard dose Rituxan arbitrary one dose Rituxan use great majority clinical trial virtually patient since FDA approval Rituxan 1997 : 375 mg/m2 weekly x 4 week . To date , Rituxan monoclonal antibody rather chemotherapeutic agent , recognize true maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) might achieve . Among factor could influence tolerance high dos Rituxan rate CD20 surface expression serum level antibody11 . Limited trial higher dos pursue CLL18 ( 2,250 mg/m2 per dose ) , type lymphoma autoimmune disease . In CLL , mild severe toxicity exclusively observe first dose ( 375 mg/m2 ) toxicity subsequent high dos minimal . In ITP , patient retreat respond well second dose rituximab initial treatment ( although opposite also true ) . Full depletion marrow especially lymph node achieve current dose regimen B cell return substantial number peripheral blood within 3-6 month patient ITP treat conventional dose . We therefore anticipate ITP patient relapse respond previous course rituximab , double dose could lead deep prolong B cell depletion well increase platelet count without enhance toxicity .</detailed_description>
