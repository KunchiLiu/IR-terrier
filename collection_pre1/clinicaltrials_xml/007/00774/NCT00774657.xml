	<detailed_description>This study evaluate leave ventricular pattern remodel hypertrophy patient aortic stenosis , compare two-dimensional echocardiography measurement ( wall thickness ) three-dimensional echocardiography data ( left ventricular mass ) . Along second objective ass Doppler diastolic fill index associate various pattern leave ventricular remodeling . Previous study ( see reference list ) primarily derive two-dimensional echo data set ( base wall thickness ) . Various pattern leave ventricular remodel described response increase pressure overload . Three-dimensional echocardiography relatively new technique increasingly use Echocardiography Lab select patient . This technique hold promise accurate volume-related measurement standard 2-dimensional echocardiography technique .</detailed_description>
