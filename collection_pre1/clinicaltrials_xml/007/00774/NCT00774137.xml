	<brief_summary>People undergo coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) heart valve surgery may experience acute kidney injury ( AKI ) surgery . Current medical test identify AKI approximately 48 hour occurs . This study examine three new biomarkers blood urine may provide effective fast way predict AKI people undergo CABG heart valve surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining New Diagnostic Tests Acute Kidney Injury After Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AKI , indicate sudden change serum creatinine level , serious complication occur patient undergoes CABG heart valve surgery . People experience AKI heart surgery may increase risk post-operative complication , include long-term kidney failure heart damage . AKI currently identify test serum creatinine level blood , traditional marker kidney function . However , serum creatinine level affect non-kidney-related factor may positively identify AKI 48 hour begin . This study examine three new biomarkers find urine blood—urine interleukin 18 ( IL-18 ) , neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) , cystatin C—that may able predict AKI effectively faster serum creatinine level . In addition , study researcher also determine change biomarkers predict severity AKI successfully serum creatinine test . This study enroll people undergo CABG heart valve surgery Yale-New Haven Hospital . Before surgery day 5 day surgery , blood urine collection occur . Study researcher also review participant ' medical record . Twelve month hospital discharge , participant return clinic follow-up visit repeat blood urine collection complete questionnaire . A portion blood save future genetic testing ; optional .</detailed_description>
