	<detailed_description>HIV infection Bahamas lead cause death among Bahamians age 15 44 . It estimate 4.13 % adult Bahamas HIV infect , Bahamas high annual incidence AIDS English-speaking Caribbean . One cause high rate infection prevalence risky behavior among Bahamian youth . Among youth age 13 15 , 32 % sexually experience , rate rise 57 % among youth age 16 older . Approximately half adolescent never use birth control , one third use birth control consistently . This study examine benefit combine youth HIV prevention education program parental program focus communication monitoring . The youth education program , develop United States modify address Caribbean culture , call Focus Youth Caribbean ( FOYC ) . FOYC already show effective increase condom use , knowledge HIV , knowledge risk associate unprotected sex drug use . Including parent intervention effort may broaden sustain effect . A study seventh eleventh grader find teens six time less likely engage sexual activity think mother disapprove . The study also find teen often clear idea parent approve disapproved , indicate need good communication parent child . Other study show parent monitor child reduce likelihood child unprotected sex use drug . The parental intervention program , call Caribbean Informed Parents Children Together ( CImPACT ) , show increase communication parent child , pair face-to-face intervention , enhance condom skills low rate sex , unprotected sex , cigarette use , alcohol use . This study examine whether pair FOYC CImPACT intervention reduce prevalence behavior present high risk HIV infection youth Bahamas . Parents randomly assign receive either CImPACT program control program call Goal It ( GFI ) , implement 1.5-hour training session . Schools randomly assign receive either FOYC program control program entitle Wonderous Wetlands . Both program implement part curriculum 15 Bahamian elementary school . Children , therefore , part 1 3 group : 1 . Parent receive CImPACT program ; school receive FOYC program 2 . Parent receive GFI program ; school receive FOYC program 3 . Parent receive GFI program ; school receive Wonderous Wetlands program Parents child assess begin study 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 month . These assessment include questionnaire measure high-risk behavior , conception risk reward involve high-risk behavior , parent adolescent communication monitoring . In continuation study : 1 . Recruit 2600 youth ( parent ) 172 Grade 10 FHLE classroom two year seven government high school New Providence , The Bahamas 2 . Randomly assign level classroom 2400 youth ( parent ) 160 class one four intervention condition : 1 ) HFLE ( parent intervention ) ; 2 ) BFOOY ( parent intervention ) ; 3 ) BFOOY plus ImPACT ( deliver parent-youth dyad ) ; 4 ) BFOOY plus GFI ( deliver parent-youth dyad ) ; 3 . Randomly assign one seven high school ( ~12 HFLE class ~200 student ) `` control school '' condition permit exploration possible class-to-class contamination within school 4 . Assess intervention effect entire youth sample 6 , 12 , 18 24 month post-intervention among parent 6 12 month 5 . Conduct sub-group analysis explore : ) impact relate intensive intervention receive two critical juncture adolescence ; ii ) effect part longitudinal trial risk/protective behavior ; iii ) extent intervention contamination randomization conduct level class rather school . Subgroups include : Exposed youth ( youth receive FOYC Grade 6 ) Na√Øve youth ( youth receive FOYC Grade 6 ) ; Enrolled youth ( youth enrol ongoing evaluation FOYC whether control intervention ( FOYC ) youth ) Not-enrolled youth ( youth never part ongoing study ) ; Control School youth ( randomly assign control condition level school Year 2 ) Control Class youth ( assign control condition level class ) Intervention effect ( primary hypothesis ) : 1 . Youth randomize HFLE exhibit significantly high rate HIV risk behavior , intention perception low knowledge condom skills 24 month post-intervention three group ; 2 . Youth randomize BFOOY plus GFI exhibit high rate abstinence behavior , intention perception youth randomize BFOOY alone 24 month follow-up 3 . Youth randomize BFOOY plus ImPACT exhibit lower rate HIV risk behavior , intention perception high rate knowledge , condom skill , STD test three group 24 month follow-up ; Parents receive ImPACT exhibit high knowledge condom use skills GFI control parent ; ImPACT parent youth report high rate discussion HIV prevention safe sex parent youth three intervention group 4 . Intervention behavioral effect consistent change perception intention posit PMT , theoretic model behavioral change BFOOY base Secondary/exploratory hypothesis include : 1 . At baseline , Exposed Youth demonstrate high rate condom-use condom-use intention perception Naive youth 2 . Exposed youth demonstrate higher protective behavior , intention perception compare Naive Youth within intervention category ( BFOOY HFLE ) throughout follow-up period 3 . Enrolled youth receive FOYC Grade 6 differ Not-enrolled youth receive FOYC Grade 6 respect intention , perception knowledge 4 . Youth Control Classes differ youth Control school respect HIV knowledge , perception intention As result study shall able identify one intervention intervention combination target mid-adolescents reduce HIV risk behavior address question regard possible interaction intervention receipt pre-adolescent mid-adolescent year . With knowledge , health policy official globally , include The Bahamas , able make evidence-based decision appropriate resource epidemiology epidemic setting .</detailed_description>
