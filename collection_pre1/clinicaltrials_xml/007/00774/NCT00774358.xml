	<brief_summary>Funding Source -- FDA OOPD . Orphan Product Grant Number -- 1R01FD004091-01A1 Context : Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) fatal , devastate disease ill-defined treatment modality , affect young boy . Classic WAS characterize clinical triad thrombocytopenia , eczema severe , recurrent infection . Despite diagnostic therapeutic advance WAS patient die less 12 year age due infection , hemorrhage , malignancy complication treatment . WAS patient suffer herpesvirus infection result poor Natural Killer ( NK ) cell function ( cytotoxicity ) . In laboratory , investigator see correction WAS Natural Killer Cell ( NK ) function treatment Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . Objectives : Initiate prospective clinical trial treating WAS subject IL-2 use safety primary endpoint . Restoration NK cell cytotoxicity effect cytoskeletal dynamic secondary endpoint . The investigator also observe patient clinical status ( eczema , infection , use treatment dose antibiotic , food allergy , etc ) . Study Design/Setting/Participants : This prospective clinical trial treat 9 WAS subject Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) IL-2 . Intervention : The investigator propose subcutaneously administer 0.5 Million Units ( MU ) /m2 IL-2 daily WAS subject 5 day . Research treatment repeat 2 4 month later . Inter-patient dose escalation employ 1 MU/m2 and/or 2 MU/m2 base safety primary endpoint . Study Measures : The investigator observe safety tolerability measure perform assay subject blood sample prior research treatment observe improvement NK cell function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) fatal genetic disease immune system result mutation WAS protein ( WASp ) gene . Immune cell carry mutation decrease ability reorganize filamentous actin ( F-actin ) activation . As result number defective immunologic function , result deficient host defense . The investigator identify pervasive deficit natural killer ( NK ) cell cytotoxicity WAS patient . WAS patient suffer condition hallmark NK cell deficiency . These include severe herpesvirus infection B cell malignancy . Our lab others also find exposure WAS subject NK cell IL-2 vitro restore NK cell function allow normal F-actin reorganization . Thus , investigator propose proof principal clinical trial treat WAS subject IL-2 determine safety efficacy IL-2 population NK cell function restore ex vivo . If IL-2 circumvent defective WASp restore NK cell function , investigator propose large NIH fund efficacy trial IL-2 WAS . The investigator also use vivo treatment WAS subject forward mechanistic study IL-2 may facilitate F-actin reorganization absence WASp function .</detailed_description>
