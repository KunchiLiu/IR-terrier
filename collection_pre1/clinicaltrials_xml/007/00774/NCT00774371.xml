	<detailed_description>Background : Overweight obesity establish negative prognostic factor premenopausal postmenopausal breast cancer . Adverse effect adiposity prognosis may explain effect gonadal hormone , insulin , insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -I , IGF bind protein ( IGFBPs ) , leptin . Objective/Hypothesis : This study test whether multifaceted approach achieve weight loss maintenance overweight obese breast cancer survivor . The intervention incorporate cognitive-behavioral therapy , increase physical activity , diet modification , strategy improve body image self-acceptance . This approach intervention develop pilot-tested support previous peer-reviewed grant . Weight change baseline one year pilot study ( n=85 ) -5.2 ( 6.3 ) kg ( mean [ SD ] ) intervention group vs. -0.1 ( 6.5 ) kg control group ( P &lt; 0.05 ) , use intent treat analysis baseline value carry forward dropout . Specific aim : ( 1 ) To test whether intervention promotes weight loss maintenance loss 18-month time period large group ; ( 2 ) To describe effect intervention hormonal factor ( insulin , leptin , IGF-I , IGFBP-1 , IGFBP-3 , sex-hormone binding globulin , serum estrogen ) ; ( 3 ) To describe relationship body weight weight reduction measure psychosocial factor ( health-related quality life , fatigue , depression , eat attitude , weight shape concern ) . Study design : The study target 253 overweight obese woman previously treat early stage breast cancer utilize randomize study design subject assign group-based healthy weight management program ( individualized telephone counsel support ) wait-list control group . Data collection include anthropometric psychosocial measure , body composition ( dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ) , cardiopulmonary fitness testing , hormonal measure baseline six 18 month .</detailed_description>
