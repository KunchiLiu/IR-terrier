	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy Patients With B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) Following Second Line Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 3 , randomize ( computer assign chance treatment arm ) , study complete multiple site compare safety efficacy ( well drug work ) lenalidomide maintenance therapy placebo ( dummy capsule contains lenalidomide active substance ) maintenance therapy . Patients assign computer 50/50 chance receive placebo lenalidomide study treatment . Study drug take day patient discontinues study . Patients remain study drug progression disease . Patients visit study doctor every 28 day disease progression complete safety efficacy assessment . Quality life assessment complete every month . If patient discontinue study drug prior disease progression ( i.e . due adverse reaction study drug ) , continue visit study doctor month complete efficacy assessment progression disease . Safety assessment may include laboratory blood test , ECG test question medical condition side effect experience study . Efficacy assessment may include laboratory blood test focus physical exam . Computed tomography ( CT ) scan along blood test bone marrow sample collect confirm patient improvement response study . After disease progression , patient contact every 12 week survival information , next CLL treatment quality life question .</detailed_description>
