	<brief_title>Evaluation Surgical Treatment Pain Disability Chronic , Non-healing Rib Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rib fracture painful disable injury commonly find among trauma patient . According National Center Health Statistics , approximately 350,000 people rib fracture treat emergency ambulatory care department United States year 2006 .

They usually tell physician surgical intervention either unnecessary fruitless treat chronic pain management regimen . The true incidence long-term outcome syndrome completely unknown . At OHSU , investigator long interest indication outcomes rib fracture repair . One first three nearly simultaneous report successful surgical intervention symptomatic rib fracture non-union originate OHSU 2001 . Two successful case report appear recently . The investigator currently contact frequently patient physician , mostly state , consideration rib fracture non-union repair . Our ongoing experience rib fracture non-union repair favorable , investigator believe prospective clinical study least 6 month post-operative outcome necessary . In addition , insurance company approval process surgical intervention rib fracture non-union often 2 - 3 month occasionally longer , investigator opportunity follow intermediate-term natural history rib fracture non-unions several month prior surgical intervention . The rationale conduct study demonstrate prospective study RibLoc ® repair system durable safe population patient rib fracture non-union . Although clinical outcome data require FDA market implant prosthesis , investigator believe establish clinical benefit RibLoc ® device non-union repair , prospectively collect outcome data necessary . Investigators may use FDA approved device ( i.e . BioBridge ™ Bioresorbable Bone Fracture Plate ) , determine device indicate ( i.e . rib resection without hardware ) .
