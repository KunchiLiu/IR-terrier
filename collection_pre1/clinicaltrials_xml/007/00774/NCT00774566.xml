	<detailed_description>Study objective : This study design randomize , control , prospective , non-inferiority clinical trial , efficacy safety cryoballoon ablation system ( CE certificate ) compare standard ablation technique ( segmental isolation pulmonary vein ) radiofrequency energy . The primary study aim investigate whether new cryoballoon ablation catheter system ( Arctic Front CryoAblation Catheters , FlexCath Steerable Sheath , CryoCath Technologies Inc. , Montreal , Canada ) least effective radiofrequency ( RF ) segmental isolation electrically disconnect pulmonary vein ( PV ) treatment paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( AF ) respect absence atrial arrhythmia without persistent complication six twelve month . Furthermore , difference term procedural complication pulmonary vein stenosis , phrenic nerve injury , cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , pericardial tamponade , pain score procedure , level cardiac inflammatory marker compare treatment group . The short long-term clinical success well cost system also evaluate . Brief description cryoablation : This catheter system use nitrous oxide refrigerant cool inside catheter tip balloon -30 -70 degree close system . Delivering freeze energy human cell several minute lead destruction . The destructed cell conduct anymore . For PV isolation cryoballoon place orifice pulmonary vein ablate muscle connection PV- leave atrium ( LA ) . Study background : AF common disable cardiac arrhythmia , affect 600.000-700.000 person Germany . In addition hemodynamic compromise high mortality rate , AF cause increase risk systemic embolus arise LA . The risk stroke inpatient nonvalvular AF 5 7 time great comparable patient without AF ; overall , 20 - 25 % ischemic stroke due cardiac embolus , half arise patient nonvalvular AF . In addition proven mortality morbidity risk , AF associate substantial burden symptom , stem arrhythmia , exacerbation comorbid condition congestive heart failure , associate anxiety possible sequela well substantial burden side effect antiarrhythmic drug ( AAD ) . Currently available treatment unsatisfactory many reason . AAD treatment relatively low efficacy even patient suffer paroxysmal AF , frequent recurrence high incidence intolerable drug side effect . Isolation PVs use RF energy show considerable clinical success treatment paroxysmal AF , associate serious complication , include PV stenosis , thromboembolic complication , cardiac perforation , phrenic nerve palsy , esophageal fistulae pericardial tamponade . Furthermore , RF painful freeze cryotherapy may pain free . CryoCath Technologies develop test Arctic Front™ Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter System ( FlexCath™ Steerable Sheath ) allow rapid formation continuous cryoablation lesion PV ostia . Pre-clinical data demonstrate long-term effectiveness balloon cryoablation permanent electrical isolation PVs risk PV stenosis . Results pre-clinical study suggest pulmonary venous stenosis thromboembolic incident occur even multiple 4 8-minute cryoenergy delivery . However , achieve adequate therapeutic effect use focal linear cryolesions often require multiple application lengthy procedure time . Balloon cryoablation subject PAF study PS-011 , feasibility study Arctic Front™ Balloon Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter System , conjunction Freezor® MAX Xtra Arctic Circler Linear™ Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter . Twenty ( 20 ) subject enrol two European center use 23 mm Arctic Front™ Balloon , additional 7 subject enrol use 28 mm Arctic Front™ Balloon . Acute procedural success 100 % , long term follow-up reveals high rate freedom recurrent AF . A low incidence adverse event note , two patient experience reversible loss phrenic nerve capture procedure . Both patient recover fully . Of original 20 subject treat 23 mm balloon , 16 / 20 ( 80 % ) AF-free 6 12 month follow-up visit . Of additional 7 subject treat 28 mm balloon , 5 / 6 ( 83 % ) AF free 6 month . Another non-randomized feasibility study Arctic Front™ 23 mm Balloon Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter System protocol PS-012 complete enrollment four center United States . Based incompletely monitor data , July 12th , 2006 , 31 patient undergone successful cryoablation procedure Acute Procedural Success ( isolation ≥ 3 PVs ) 100 % ( 31 / 31 subject ) . Electrical isolation achieve 129 / 130 PVs ( 99.3 % ) . A total 67 adverse event ( AE ) report , death . Nine ( 9 ) serious AEs report . Four device relate serious AEs involve change phrenic nerve conduction : 3 patient cryoablation discontinue immediately nerve function recover completely 1 month , fourth subject transient loss capture procedure , follow 1 month visit shortness breath , viral infection slight paralysis hemidiaphragm . Two device relate serious AEs pericardial tamponade require pericardiocentesis hospitalization , right groin hematoma . Three additional non-device relate serious AEs include one episode chest pain , one instance right neck bleed vascular access one instance leave groin site bleed vascular access . Long term follow-up PS-012 incomplete , 17 subject reach 3 month , 14 / 17 ( 82 % ) free recurrent AF . Only one 14 subject previously fail AF drug , give 76 % ( 13 / 17 ) rate freedom recurrent AF drug . Additional data another non-randomized clinical study available ( Neumann et al . Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation cryoballoon technique . JACC 2008 , Vol 52 ( 4 ) ; 273-8 ) . 346 patient consecutive patient three German center undergone successful cryoablation therapy . The study population consist 293 patient paroxysmal 53 patient persistent atrial fibrillation . Isolation pulmonary vein achieve 97 % freedom document paroxysmal atrial fibrillation achieve 74 % median follow-up 12 month . No death PV narrowing occur . In 26 patient ( 7,5 % ) phrenic nerve palsy could observe . The majority patient recover within 6 month , patient recover within 12 month . Based encouraging result randomize clinical study design provide valid scientific evidence safety effectiveness Arctic Front™ Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter System ( FlexCath™ Steerable Sheath ) electrically isolate PVs patient PAF compare segmental isolation RF-energy , represent widely accept use energy form AF-ablation procedure . Compared RF ablation procedure PV isolation Cryo Balloon technique easy faster perform need expensive additional mapping system avoid current dreaded complication PV-stenosis esophageal fistula .

Another MRI CT scan perform third month re-evaluate PVs least one 24h holter ECG record screen symptomatic asymptomatic atrial arrhythmia ( AF , AT ) do . An event recorder holter ECG reveal long-term recurrence give six twelve month follow-up ( minimum seven day , preferably 14 day ) 22 . In case recurrence second procedure perform six month index procedure . The procedure choice recurrence modality patient originally randomize Endpoints : Primary endpoint : Combined endpoint : Absence atrial arrhythmia absence persistent complication six twelve month procedure . Secondary endpoint : Short- mid-term clinical success Long-term clinical success Total radiation exposure Total procedure duration Pain sensation procedure Quality life Changes cardiac marker ( CK , troponin , CRP ) Bleedings Costs Biometrical concept : Randomization The randomization number allocate two group balance permuted block use random number generator validate software SAS® . To avoid potential predict group allocation future patient , block length fix separate document withheld study site . Sealed envelope produce labeled randomization number . Inside seal envelope , data sheet defines group allocation patient respective randomization number . On enrollment study , patient receives randomization envelope consecutive order inclusion study . Basic characteristic patient day randomization document data sheet order allow check whether randomization scheme observe strictly . Statistical consideration : Test problem analysis primary endpoint The primary objective trial demonstrate non-inferiority isolate PVs procedure cryoballoon catheter ( CC ) compare radiofrequency isolation ( RF ) respect primary endpoint `` absence atrial arrhythmia absence persistent complication six twelve month procedure '' , respectively . For purpose , follow test problem assess : Null hypothesis H0 : pCC ( rate absence atrial arrhythmias absence persistent complication twelve month procedure CC ) - pRF ( rate absence atrial arrhythmias absence persistent complication twelve month procedure RF ) -d versus alternative hypothesis H1 : pCC - pRF &gt; -d , = 0.15 defines non-inferiority margin deem acceptable view advantage CC respect aspect primary endpoint . The analogous test problem formulate endpoint six month follow . These test problem analyze apply non-inferiority test rate accord Farrington Manning17 one-sided significance level = 2.5 % . The following multiple test procedure hierarchically order hypothesis apply account multiplicity primary endpoint : The null hypothesis formulate six month outcome test null hypothesis twelve month outcome reject ; otherwise null hypothesis accept . If null hypothesis reject , null hypothesis H0g test one-sided level = 2.5 % margin g &lt; long H0g accept value gSTOP . Then , non-inferiority CC compare RF show non-inferiority margin g &lt; gSTOP . This multiple test procedure control overall type I error rate a18 , 19 . Confirmatory analysis primarily base FAS consistent intention-to-treat ( ITT ) principle include patient randomize two group . This approach reflect idea study match close possible condition clinical practice . However , PP analysis play important role particularly non-inferiority study , therefore result PP analysis set interpret discussed special attention parallel ITT analysis . Determination sample size Sample size calculation base following consideration . In view advantage CC compare RF dimension primary endpoint , inferiority difference rate 0.15 CC compare RF respect two primary outcome deem acceptable . Therefore , non-inferiority range set equal = 0.15 . On basis previous study experience procedures16 , equal rate pCC = pRF = 0.78 assumed sample size calculation . Under assumption , sample size require achieve power 1 - b = 80 % one-sided Farrington-Manning test level = 2.5 % amount 2 x 122 = 244 patients17 . In order cope uncertainty assume overall rate 0.78 , sample size review perform 150 patient randomized outcome primary variable available 100 patient , respectively , depend event occurs first . No significance test perform hence option early stopping rejection null hypothesis . Instead , overall rate primary variable estimate base available data sample size recalculate employ obtain value sample size formula ( i.e . pCC = pRF = estimate overall rate ) leave value , 1-b , . It show procedure affect type I error rate analysis20 . Each patient 's allocation different analysis population ( full analysis set ( FAS ) accord intention-to-treat ( ITT ) principle , per protocol ( PP ) analysis set , safety analysis set ) define prior analysis . The allocation document statistical analysis plan . During data review start analysis , deviation protocol assess `` minor '' `` major '' . Major deviation protocol lead exclusion patient PP analysis set . If patient discontinues study prematurely , miss data respect primary outcome variable replace ICA-r method19 . Analysis secondary endpoint The secondary variable analyze descriptively tabulation measure empirical distribution . According scale level variable , mean , standard deviation , median , 1st 3rd quartile well minimum maximum absolute relative frequency , respectively , report . Logistic regression model apply assess effect potential risk factor primary secondary efficacy variable . Additionally , variable longitudinal measurement time course individual patient summarize treatment group compare . Descriptive p-values correspond statistical test compare treatment group associate 95 % confidence interval give . The safety analysis base set patient one procedure apply . Adverse serious adverse event well complication tabulate , absolute relative frequency ; severity relationship procedure give compare group . Cardiac marker describe interpreted respect reference value , measure describe empirical distribution change calculate . Additionally , cardiac marker , shift table present change category `` normal '' `` abnormal '' give per treatment group .
