	<brief_summary>The objective 2-year study two-fold : 1 . To determine 5-7 year patency rate ( rate open bypass graft ) LITA graft patient already robotically-assisted CABG surgery use CTA MPS-MIBI 2 . To determine patient quality life 5-7 year robotically-assisted CABG surgery</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>New technique robotically-assisted CABG surgery need proper evaluation ensure potential benefit gain harmful know significant benefit patient , leave internal thoracic artery ( LITA ) graft ( one main coronary artery supply heart blood ) . We therefore propose 5-7 year CT-Angiography ( CTA ) Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy ( MPS-MIBI ) ass patency rate LITA graft patient already undergone robotically assist CABG . Between September 1999 December 2001 , single surgeon perform robotically-assisted CABG surgery LITA-to-LAD anastomosis 151 patient single vessel coronary artery disease London Health Sciences Centre , University Hospital . Patient consent Research Ethics approval The University Western Ontario acquire prior procedure . Sixty-one patient robotically-assisted CABG surgery use Automated Endoscopic Stabilizer Optimal Positioning ( AESOP ) 3000 ( Computer Motion , Goleta , CA ) , 90 patient robotically-assisted CABG surgery use Zeus telemanipulation surgical system ( Computer Motion , Goleta , CA ) . The AESOP 3000 single-arm robot facilitates video thoracoscopic LITA dissection provide steady image voice-activated camera control . The Zeus telemanipulation surgical system multi-arm robotic telemanipulator incorporate AESOP allow control surgical instrument within thorax distant console . Postoperative angiography complete prior discharge whenever possible . Patients continue follow annual basis . Our intent perform follow-up angiography MPS-MIBI 5 10 year duration ass LITA graft performance discuss patient time original surgery . Two late death unrelated surgery record cohort . The 2-year study divide three phase : Phase I - Patient Recruitment ( 4 month ) , Phase II - Patient Assessment CTA , MPS-MIBI Questionnaires ( 16 month ) Phase III - Data Analysis Conclusions ( 4 month ) . Phase I - Chart Review Patient Recruitment ( 4 Months ) Upon receive approval Research Ethics Board The University Western Ontario , chart review 151 robotically-assisted CABG surgery patient . Data patient currently store regularly update database institution ; however , thorough review chart perform . Patient demographic operative note , well perioperative postoperative complication review . Hospital admission , document cardiac event subsequent death previously document record . Any additional pertinent data chart review enter study specific Microsoft Excel file maintain single qualified research assistant . All 149 live robotically-assisted CABG surgery patient contact participation study request . Patients receive initial request mail , informative letter sign principal investigator outline purpose study , participation study involve , specific aim cardiac team conclusion study . A follow-up phone call do within 3-weeks mailing letter go content answer question patient may . Phase II - Patient Assessment via CTA , MPS-MIBI Questionnaires ( 16 Months ) Robotically-assisted CABG surgery patient agree part study arrangement make travel LHSC . Patients undergo structured half-day ( approximately 4-6 hour ) hospital consist following : 1 . Selective coronary artery LITA graft check via CTA 64 slice CT scanner + Rest MPS-MIBI Stress MPS-MIBI ( 4-6hrs ) 2 . Completion two validate health relate quality life questionnaires 1 . Seattle Angina Questionnaire 2 . 36-Item Short Form Health Survey</detailed_description>
