	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether monthly deep subcutaneous ( s.c. ) injection lanreotide Autogel ( Somatuline Depot ) effective safe control diarrhoea flush reduce usage s.c. short-acting octreotide rescue medication control symptoms subject carcinoid syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Somatuline Depot ( Lanreotide ) Injection Treat Carcinoid Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist Screening period , conduct 4 month randomisation , follow three phase : 16-week , double blind ( DB ) , randomise , placebo-controlled phase ; 32-week initial open label ( IOL ) phase ; long term open label extension ( LTOLE ) phase . The DB phase evaluate lanreotide Autogel versus placebo subject history carcinoid syndrome ( flush and/or diarrhoea ) . This follow 32-week IOL phase subject receive lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 4 week . Subjects country lanreotide Autogel approve treatment carcinoid syndrome , well-controlled end 32-week IOL phase choose continue receive lanreotide Autogel , give option participate LTOLE phase . The LTOLE phase study plan end least 2 year last subject complete his/her participation 32-week IOL phase marketing approval treatment symptom carcinoid syndrome obtain respective country ( whichever occur first ) time study terminate Sponsor . The actual overall duration study 6.5 year . During LTOLE phase subject continue treated lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 4 week . The study plan enrol approximately 100 adult subject worldwide . Screening continue 115 subject enrol study .</detailed_description>
