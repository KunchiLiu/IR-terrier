	<brief_summary>Hypoglycemia low blood sugar serious complication diabetic experience . This great concern lack available information Non Insulin Dependent Diabetic Mellitus patient ( NIDDM ) defend low blood sugar . This particularly disturb since NIDDM patient likely require intensive treatment , result , risk severe hypoglycemia NIDDM patient increase . The current proposal aim provide information NIDDM patient defend hypoglycemia , thus decrease risk severe complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There little data available neuroendocrine response hypoglycemia intensively treat ( sulfonylurea insulin ) NIDDM patient . The data available neuroendocrine response hypoglycemia NIDDM patient obtain condition follow single IV bolus insulin single SQ regular insulin injection . The neuroendocrine response follow large IV bolus insulin differs greatly clinical paradigm slow progression hypoglycemia . Therefore , clinically relevant data obtain short experiment involve rapid change plasma glucose level insulinemia . Furthermore , comparison neuroendocrine response hypoglycemia NIDDM normal man available due fact glycemia never equally control . In short , virtually nothing known neuroendocrine response hypoglycemia subject . This great concern follow positive outcome Kumamato study , large number NIDDM subject go receive intensive therapy altendent risk severe hypoglycemia . The Kumamato study trial NIDDM patient determine intensive therapy reduces tissue complication diabetes . Similar result Diabetes control complication trial IDDM patient Kumamato study prove intensive therapy NIDDM patient also prevent diabetic tissue complication . Therefore , goal study 1 ) define great detail body defend hypoglycemia NIDDM patient 2 ) determine differ level insulin affect hypoglycemic counterregulation NIDDM patient .</detailed_description>
