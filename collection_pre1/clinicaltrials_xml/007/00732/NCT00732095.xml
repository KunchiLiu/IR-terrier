	<detailed_description>Brief Overview : Research find natural recovery ( self-change ) common pathway change individual alcohol problem , account nearly 75 % recovery several national survey . Although member public aware self-change possible , also case many individual alcohol problem enter treatment stigma fear label . The propose study base finding recent randomize controlled trial design promote self-change community problem drinker never treatment . Media advertisement use recruit 825 participant . Eligible respondent send assessment material complete . After assessment material return , participant randomly assign receive two alcohol pamphlet freely available community personalize feedback base assessment response ( e.g. , drink compare national norm , health risk associate drinking ) . A 1-year follow find difference drink behavior group , group substantial reduction drink 1-year pre- 1-year post-intervention . In attempt determine account change , participant ' report drink evaluate regard critical study time point ( e. g. , assessment material receive ) . Surprisingly , result reveal many change see advertisement , receive assessment material complete . This suggest either see ad ( `` Thinking change drinking ? '' ) message ad ( `` Did know 75 % people change drink ? '' ) may catalyze change . To evaluate change occurs mechanism may give rise change , randomize control trial involve 3 group conduct . The group differ whether receive message inform self-change common phenomenon ( two group receive message , one ) occasion message deliver ( consent study assessment vs. intervention material ) . Comparisons make possible experimental design allow evaluation message precipitant change . The use Timeline Followback retrospective report daily drink record critical date allow statistical analysis pattern inflection ( i.e. , change drink ) relate see ad , receive message , receive complete assessment material , receive intervention material . Possible explanation message could function mechanism behavior change offer ( e.g. , catastrophe theory , cognitive social learn theory ) . The ultimate objective research develop cost-effective , large scale intervention view early stage public health , step care model encourage self-change individual alcohol problem . Main Goals Justification The propose research project outgrowth extension research Drs . Linda Mark Sobell conduct many year . That research begin investigation individual recover alcohol problem without treatment ( natural recovery ) . A major find natural recovery research , conduct Canada support similar data US , rather uncommon occurrence , self-change major pathway change . Another find natural recovery research commonly report precipitant change cognitive appraisal ( i.e. , cost-benefit analysis ) 1that occur time rather particular isolated event ( event-precipitated recovery ) . The individual likely achieve natural recovery severe problem also tend access treatment resource . Our natural recovery research finding lead design study , Promoting Self-Change , intend encourage problem drinker within community set never seek treatment formal help change drinking ( Sobell et al. , 1996 ) . The experimental intervention PSC study model evidence-based material develop use Guided Self-Change model treatment , brief cognitive-behavioral motivational intervention Although experimental control group show significant reduction drink 1-year pre- 1-year post-intervention , result show people receive experimental motivational material show great change receive two alcohol pamphlet freely available community ( Sobell et al. , 2002 ) . Fortunately , collect drinking data use Timeline Followback ( Sobell &amp; Sobell , 1992 , 2003 , 2007 press ) keep record important event ( e.g. , date person call screen , date assessment material mail ) , allow u explore change occur . Contrary hypothesis , major reduction drink appear occur intervention material receive , rather participant saw study advertisement . Thus , discuss detail design section , see ad message ad identify possible important precipitant change . The propose project randomize control study investigate issue . Based previous Promoting Self-Change study , conduct randomize controlled trial consist three group design tease apart alternative possible explanation mechanisms behavior change within community base mail intervention . In particular , study investigate timing point inflection ( i.e. , change ) participant ' report drinking participate study . The three experimental group differ whether receive message inform self-change common phenomenon ( two group receive message , one ) occasion message deliver ( consent study assessment vs. intervention material ) . This design allow follow 5 objective address : - To evaluate message communicates self-change ( i.e. , alcohol problem ) common prompt participant engage process self-change resulting change drink behavior - To evaluate whether difference effectiveness depend message self-change common present ( assessment versus intervention ) - To evaluate whether see advertisement prompt participant think change drink change absence message self-change common - To evaluate whether receive message part intervention material add value effect receive intervention material . - To conduct correlative investigation whether participant report change drink contiguous first see advertisement , receive assessment material ( without message ) , receive intervention feedback . Possible explanation message could function mechanism behavior change offer catastrophe theory cognitive social learn theory . The ultimate objective line research development cost-effective , large scale intervention serve early stage public health , step care model encourage self-change community individual alcohol problem .</detailed_description>
