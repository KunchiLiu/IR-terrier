	<brief_summary>Primary : To evaluate progression-free survival first treatment progression death second-line therapy ( total PFS ) sorafenib follow sunitinib superior compare sunitinib follow sorafenib . Secondary : 1 . Time first treatment progression second-line therapy ( total TTP ) 2 . Time first-line treatment failure ( progression , death , discontinuation due toxicity ) descriptively arm 3 . PFS first-line second-line treatment , descriptively 4 . Overall survival , descriptively ( data cut-off primary endpoint ) 5 . Disease Control Rate ( DCR ) ; Response rate first-line second-line ( CR , PR , SD accord RECIST criterion ) 6 . Cardiotoxicity analysis mean echocardiography NT-pro BNP interim analysis 100 patient arm complete study 7 . Safety tolerability</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The result three sequential retrospective study ( Sablin et al , ASCO 2007 ; Dham et al , ASCO 2007 ; Tamaskar et al , 2008 ) support sequential administration sorafenib sunitinib even though two drug overlap target . These result suggest lack cross resistance sorafenib sunitinib . This study sequential , randomize , open-label ( 1:1 ) , multicenter phase III study start first-line metastatic / advance RCC use experimental arm sorafenib progression follow sunitinib control arm sunitinib progression follow sorafenib . Sorafenib-patients switch sunitinib vice versa , treatment-free period least one maximum four week confirm first-line treatment failure , order avoid additive toxicity . In general , first-line treatment continue progression ( RECIST ) . However , patient tolerate first-line medication ( sorafenib sunitinib ) toxicity , may cross-over second-line therapy ( sunitinib sorafenib ) despite lack progression , appropriate attempt accord specific dose reduction / interruption scheme make cope toxicity try resume first line therapy , deem appropriate reduce dose . In case discontinuation first-line treatment toxicity , patient enrol second-line treatment , nonhematological toxicity resolve grade ≤1 hematological toxicity grade ≤2 . As exception , patient refuse treat first-line regimen due intolerability despite progression may cross second-line treatment , consent general compliance . Any crossover , also without progression , require CT scan , case also consider baseline scan second-line treatment . One cycle six week duration . Patients undergo CT/MRI scan every second cycle ( i.e . 12 week ) , evaluate accord RECIST criterion . There continuation study medication beyond progression first- second-line therapy . After study reach primary endpoint cut , i.e . 194 endpoint event occur , clean data patient exist statistical analysis perform data collection stop . After trial terminate close visit perform . Remaining patient treat outside study censor analysis .</detailed_description>
