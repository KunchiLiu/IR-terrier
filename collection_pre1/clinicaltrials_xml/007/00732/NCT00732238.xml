	<brief_summary>The specific objective clinical trial demonstrate multifaceted approach treatment catheter-related urinary tract infection ( UTI ) patient spinal cord injury effective feasible . We plan test follow hypothesis : multifaceted treatment approach consist immediate removal indwell bladder catheter , select antibiotic base find urine culture obtain newly insert catheter , 5-day course systemic antibiotic effectively treat catheter-related infection limit low urinary tract patient spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multifaceted Treatment Catheter-related Urinary Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>UTI common infection patient spinal cord injury require catheter drain urine bladder . These infection cause serious medical complication , bloodstream infection , decrease kidney function , prolonged hospitalization , add great cost . Unfortunately , treatment catheter-related urinary tract infection standardize population term : - need replace indwelling catheter ; - necessity provide antibiotic coverage organism grown urine culture ; - duration antibiotic treatment . The prevalent , though scientifically well support approach treat catheter-related low UTI patient spinal cord injury comprises follow : - Retaining original bladder catheter place upon diagnosis infection theoretical concern removal infect catheter may potentially cause infect organism move bladder bloodstream ( bacteremia ) . This theoretical complication , however , unlikely even occur , bacteria would remain bloodstream short period time would significant impact patient . In contrast , propose immediate removal original indwelling bladder catheter film protect bacteria enhance resolution UTI . - Providing antibiotic coverage organism grow urine culture obtain original indwell bladder catheter . Although source urine culture sensitive method identify organisms present urine , suffers poor specificity may yield growth organism could colonize catheter ( , therefore , grown culture urine obtain original catheter ) contribute UTI . This issue particularly problematic patient spinal cord injury urine culture almost half case UTI population yield multiple bacteria . Therefore , propose collection urine culture insert new bladder catheter would yield growth organism truly contribute UTI , therefore , obviate need administer unnecessary antibiotic cover additional organism would grow urine culture obtain original catheter . - Treatment systemic antibiotic 10 day . There exist , however , prospective randomize clinical trial indicate duration antibiotic therapy optimal patient spinal cord injury . Since catheter-free , able-bodied patient low UTI successfully treat course antibiotic short 1-3 day , propose remove focus infection ( i.e . original catheter ) 5-day course systemic antibiotic would sufficient treat catheter-related low UTI patient spinal cord injury . The result research expect provide follow major benefit veteran spinal cord injury : - multifaceted approach provide highly effective treatment UTI ; - low number antibiotic administer cover organism grown urine culture obtain time insert replacement bladder catheter result low cost treatment reduce risk develop antibiotic resistance ; - shorter duration antibiotic course decrease overall cost treatment , reduce hospital stay , shorten rehabilitation time .</detailed_description>
