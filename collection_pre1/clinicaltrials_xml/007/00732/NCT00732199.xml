	<brief_title>Determinants Age Related Breathing Instability During Non-Rapid-Eye-Movement ( NREM ) Sleep</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome ( SAS ) relatively common disorder US population significant adverse health consequence . Despite high prevalence SAS elderly individual , underlie mechanism remain elusive . Specifically , know whether high prevalence sleep apnea old adult due increase central breathing instability . This proposal focus investigate age-specific difference susceptibility central breathe instability healthy individual well individual sleep apnea . This project investigate follow specific objective : - Determine age-specific change hypocapnic apneic threshold sleep - elderly v young individual without sleep apnea - elderly v young individual sleep apnea . - Determine age-specific change long-term facilitation sleep - elderly versus young individual without sleep apnea - elderly v young individual sleep apnea . - We investigate susceptibility central breathe instability mechanically ventilating subject NREM sleep use pressure support ventilation . We compare hypocapnic apneic threshold old ( age &gt; 60-65 year ) young ( age 18-40years ) individual healthy well sleep-disordered breathing . We also measure parameter continuum age 18 89y . - We investigate whether difference susceptibility long term facilitation genioglossus activity ventilation young old healthy individual response episodic hypoxia , maintain isocapnia . We conduct similar experiment young old individual sleep apnea . Sleep apnea common old veteran associate significant cardiovascular complication . Greater insight pathogenesis positive impact health veteran suffer condition . This proposal understand pathogenesis breathe instability lead sleep-disordered breathing sleep . Thus , anticipate finding provide basis new approach prevention management SAS veteran .</detailed_description>
