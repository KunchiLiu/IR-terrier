	<brief_title>Lag-3 Gemcitabine Treatment Advanced Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I , single center , open label , non-randomized , dose-escalation phase I study performed ambulatory set patient receive first line chemotherapy unresectable pancreas cancer gemcitabine weekly investigational agent IMP321 . IMP321 give D2 D16 4-week cycle , period 6 month . The hypothesis study IMP321 safe human administration . Additionally hypothesize IMP321 elicit immunomodulatory effect therapeutic treatment pancreas cancer . Primary Objectives - To evaluate safety tolerability repeat IMP321 subcutaneous injection patient treat gemcitabine advanced pancreas cancer . - To determine dose limit toxicity IMP321 patient treat gemcitabine advanced pancreas cancer . Secondary Objectives - To describe pharmacokinetics last IMP321 subcutaneous injection compare first one , limited number patient . - To determine pharmacodynamics IMP321 therapy : - Quantify peripheral blood Treg ( CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cell ) pancreatic cancer patient treatment IMP321 flow cytometry . - Evaluate B- T-cell response pancreatic cancer-expressed antigen , mesothelin , test antibody T-cell response ELISpot . - To evaluate clinical response time disease progression compute tomography examination two month interval ( current standard care gemcitabine-treated patient ) .</detailed_description>
