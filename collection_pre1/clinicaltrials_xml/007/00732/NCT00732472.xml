	<brief_summary>The study drug inhale bronchodilator ( lung airway relaxant ) give healthy volunteer COPD patient . This study assess new formulation GSK573719 . Many drug know deteriorate time . To make study medicine less likely deteriorate container , mixed inactive substance help maintain quality study medicine . Previous study look GSK573719 another inactive substance call Cellobiose Octaacetate ( COA ) . This study look new formulation GSK573719 use Magnesium Stearate ( MgSt ) inactive substance . MgSt medicine approve food ingredient also approve used number market medical inhaler . The purpose study assess safety tolerability compound GSK573719 Magnesium Stearate once-daily treatment COPD ( Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ) . This drug give 2 group 12 people 7 day . Group 1 receive 250mcg placebo group 2 receive 1000mcg placebo . Group 2 dose least 6 people complete dose group 1 without significant safety concern . The following safety measure assess include : ECGs , heart rate , blood pressure , blood sample safety lab , lung function 24 hour monitor heart . We also take blood urine sample measure medication level body . GlaxoSmithKline fund research recruit Synexus 7 centre UK .</brief_summary>
