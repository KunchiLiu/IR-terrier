	<brief_title>Exercise Healthy Diet Standard Care Patients Remission From Stage I Stage II Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : * To reduce morbidity early mortality endometrial cancer ( EC ) survivor obesity management . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To expand refine previous pilot study behavioral , lifestyle-change education intervention use overweight obese patient remission endometrial carcinoma . - To determine potential effect variation regimen patient . - To explore potential mediator ( self-efficacy , depression ) moderator ( body mass index ) healthful dietary exercise behavior . - To evaluate neuronal response high-versus-low calorie visual food stimulus fast ( hunger ) fed ( satiate ) state brain region interest ( hypothalamus , lateral orbitofrontal cortex , ventral striatum , insula ) use blood oxygenation level dependent ( BOLD ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) lifestyle ( diet exercise counseling ) intervention usual care obese EC patient . We also compare neuronal response obese EC patient normal weight subject without cancer see gynecologic clinic ; , explore modification neuronal signal candidate gene serum biomarkers hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis , serotonergic inflammatory pathway . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord body mass index ( 25.0-39.9 v ≥ 40 ) randomize 1 2 intervention arm . - Arm I : Patients receive lifestyle intervention , `` Survivors Uterine Cancer Empowered Exercise Healthy Diet ( SUCCEED ) '' , group individual basis consist nutrition , exercise , behavioral modification counsel physician , psychologist , register dietitian , physical therapist . Sixteen group session conduct ( 10 weekly , 6 bi-weekly ) 6 month . Weight body mass index , satisfaction study treatment , exercise/activity log assess weekly biweekly . Patients receive additional feedback support week meet group , include newsletter telephone e-mail contact . - Arm II ( control ) : Patients receive usual care informational brochure , lifestyle counseling , related weight loss , physical activity , nutrition . Patients undergo physician counseling session baseline 3 , 6 , 12 month . Patients assess weight , anthropometric measure , body mass index ; biomarkers ; body composition dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry/densitometry ( DEXA ) ; co-morbidities Charlson co-morbidity score ; depression Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) ; eat pattern Three-Factor Eating Inventory ( EI ) ; exercise/physical activity Leisure Score Index ( LSI ) pedometer step count ; nutrient intake 24-hour recall ; quality life Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General ( FACT-G ) Short-form Medical Outcomes ( SF-36 ) ; self-efficacy Self-Efficacy Questionnaire ( SEQ ) Weight Efficacy Life-Style ( WEL ) .</detailed_description>
