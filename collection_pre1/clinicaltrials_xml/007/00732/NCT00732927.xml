	<brief_summary>Retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) second common retinal disease diabetic retinopathy , common cause unilateral visual loss . There two aim management RVO : identification modifiable risk factor medical management recognition management sight-threatening complication . The management disease include laser therapy control systemic associate disease . Many treatment propose evidence efficacy modulate outcome branch central RVO . There currently adequate clinical trial evaluate efficacy safety antithrombotic agent set . Antiplatelet agent frequently use clinical practice . Anticoagulant drug , either heparin coumarins , also use set represent first line therapy treatment venous thromboembolism . Aim randomize control study compare efficacy safety aspirin low molecular weight heparin , parnaparin , treatment RVO . Study treatment administer 3 month . Primary end-point study incidence functional worsening eye RVO 6 month . Secondary efficacy outcome follow : proportion case require laser treatment extension ischemic lesion and/or presence neovascularisation and/or macular oedema , incidence recurrent RVO objectively document fluorescein angiography . Safety outcomes define incidence major minor bleed event .</brief_summary>
