	<brief_title>Hepatic Arterial Infusion ( HAI ) Abraxane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Nab-paclitaxel design block cancer cell divide , may cause cell die . Giving nab-paclitaxel directly liver may allow high dose drug give , avoid side effect occur high dos chemotherapy give way ( example , vein arm ) . Study Drug Dose Level : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 9 group 6 participant enrol Part 1 study , 18 participant enrol Part 2 . If enrol Part 1 , dose study drug receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level study drug . Each new group receive high dose study drug group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose study drug find . If enrol Part 2 , receive study drug high dose tolerate Part 1 portion . Study Drug Administration : The study drug give Day 1 `` cycle '' 21 day long . In Cycle 1 , participant may receive study drug vein arm . The infusion last 60 minute . In Cycles 2 later , receive study drug catheter ( thin plastic tube ) . Each time catheter place , admitted hospital . The doctor performs catheter placement procedure explain detail , ask sign separate consent form describe procedure risk detail . You take Interventional Radiology area , catheter place blood vessel groin area , right side body . The catheter advance liver . The catheter carefully tap order prevent move come receive study drug . You bedrest entire time catheter place . After catheter insert , take Nuclear Medicine area , test call `` flow study '' perform order confirm catheter right place . The doctor perform test explain detail , ask sign separate consent form describe procedure risk detail . After return room , receive study drug catheter 60 minute 4 hour , depend enroll . You ask lie flat back receive study drug . The catheter remove someone experienced procedure . It remove right study drug dose complete . While catheter remove , study staff apply pressure groin area 15 minute order stop bleeding . You repeat procedure every 21 day . The catheter place removed time . Study Procedures Tests : Once week , include dose study drug , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . These blood draw do M. D. Anderson somewhere else , place convenient . Once cycle ( day already clinic ) , physical exam , include measurement height , weight , vital sign . Urine collect routine test . At end every 3 cycle , scan perform ( type scan screen ) check status disease . If study doctor feel appropriate , may blood drawn ( 1 teaspoon ) look tumor marker . Blood Testing Research Purposes : In Cycles 1 2 , additional blood drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . For participant receive study drug 60 minute , blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn Day 1 ( receive study drug 5 , 10 , 20 40 minute start dose , 1 , 1½ , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 hour start dose ) . Blood also draw Day 2 ( 24 hour start dose ) . For participant receive study drug 4 hour , blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn Day 1 ( receive study drug 30 minute start dose , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 4 ½ , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 hour start dose ) . Blood also draw Day 2 ( 24 hour start dose ) . Length Study Participation : You continue receive study drug every 21 day . If disease get bad intolerable side effect occur , take study drug . End-of-Study Visit : After last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - To check status disease , scan perform ( type scan ) . - If study doctor feel appropriate , may blood drawn ( 1 teaspoon ) look tumor marker . This investigational study . Nab-paclitaxel commercially available FDA approve use breast cancer `` systemic '' use . Systemic therapy affect body whole . It investigational give nab-paclitaxel directly liver give patient advance cancer . At time , give directly liver patient advanced cancer do research . Up 56 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
