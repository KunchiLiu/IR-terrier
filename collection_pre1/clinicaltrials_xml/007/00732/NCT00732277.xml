	<brief_summary>Severe bacterial infection affect multiple body organ , call severe sepsis ( include meningococcal sepsis ) , remain important cause death disability among child . Although early recognition , powerful antibiotic , good intensive care improve outcome , need new way reduce number death . Research adults show steroid replacement therapy might useful . However , child know respond differently adult definitive trial child need potentially harmful well beneficial effect steroid . This pilot study provide necessary information allow rational design large trial conduct multiple hospital investigate role corticosteroid replacement therapy childhood sepsis . The study provide information measure effect steroid , information length therapy well understanding steroid work child . The result emerge study ultimately allow paediatric intensive care clinician know whether steroid safe and/or useful . The primary objective open−label study therefore gather clinical laboratory data inform design large phase 3 double blind randomise control trial ( RCT ) . The study provide basic limited safety data , information length therapy assessment possible clinical laboratory endpoint use addition mortality . Definition sepsis : Presence document infection ( eg clinical evidence pneumonia , skin soft tissue infection , purpura fulminans , urinary tract infection , abdominal infection ) diagnostic positive blood culture ( community hospital acquire ) within last 72 hour least two follow , one must abnormal temperature leucocyte count [ 3 ] core temperature &gt; 38.5°C &lt; 36°C ; tachycardia ( mean heart rate &gt; 2 SD normal age ) ; mean respiratory rate &gt; 2 SD normal age ; leucocyte count elevate depressed age . Definition severe sepsis : Sepsis plus cardiovascular organ dysfunction ( need least 5mcg/kg/min dopamine dobutamine , amount adrenaline noradrenaline support ) , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , 2 organ dysfunction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Corticosteroid Therapy Childhood Severe Sepsis - Randomised Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . PURPOSE : The Need Paediatric Trial Steroids Sepsis - potential benefit risk Numerous target new therapy sepsis identify , none show benefit child . The result adult study therefore extrapolate directly childhood disease . Corticosteroids alter inflammatory balance beneficial harmful way severe sepsis . Recent adult study demonstrate transient adrenal insufficiency associate adverse outcome corticosteroid increase survival specific patient group , steroid replacement become standard care . There little uniformity approach steroid replacement therapy amongst lead paediatric centre UK . Expert opinion emphasise guidance interim await appropriate paediatric study . Steroids perceive `` safe '' `` cheap '' introduce paediatric practice without research . Sepsis childhood differs term mortality ( around 10 % overall child vs excess 40 % adult ) , background immunity , co−morbidity , causative organism . Given low overall mortality childhood sepsis , steroids potential disrupt inflammatory balance child cause great harm benefit . It known patient target therapeutic intervention ; appropriate endpoint ; whether length steroid therapy shorter child ; whether immunological rebound occur . 2 . DESIGN METHODOLOGY : This open randomise prospective pilot exploratory study corticosteroid replacement therapy three centre . Adrenal function measurement assess entry study . To investigate inflammatory profile impact corticosteroid replacement , blood take cytokine coagulation protein analysis . This study provide pilot data necessary design definitive trial corticosteroid replacement therapy identification variable likely improve ability stratify patient intervention mechanistic characterisation modulatory effect steroid inflammation child severe sepsis . Enrolment undertaken two stage ( see flowsheet diagram protocol ) . Forty five eligible child randomly allocate steroid replacement therapy 2 day ( n=30 ) intensive investigation without intervention ( n=15 ) 2:1 randomisation ( stage 1 ) ; 45 subject ( stage 2 ) randomly allocate steroid replacement therapy 5 day ( n=30 ) intensive investigation without intervention ( n=15 ) . Randomisation undertaken accordance computer−generated list stratify age ( &lt; 1 year ; 1 year ) . Progression stage 1 stage 2 follow interim analysis Trial Monitoring Group ensure safety . This escalate approach provide safety data , information length therapy assessment possible clinical laboratory endpoint addition mortality , reduce potential adverse event pilot phase provide data relevant population . A large excess serious adverse event stage 1 result study termination . After careful consideration investigator peer review process , placebo use study , inform future large phase 3 randomise control trial . RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS WILL RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE NOT PART OF ROUTINE CLINICAL CARE ( Please also refer figure 1−4 protocol unable reproduce ) : Children screen admission PICU . Entry study follow consent involve clinical test endocrine function involve 2 blood test . The list procedure conduct study follow : 1. confirm eligibility requirement , assess pre−existing condition medical history , record weight , height , vital sign , data inform clinical severity score , complete infection assessment , clinically relevant laboratory investigation 2. corticotrophin stimulation test 3. multiple study sample ( endocrine , cytokine coagulation test ) 4. corticosteroid treatment randomise treatment group 5. follow−up routine clinic</detailed_description>
