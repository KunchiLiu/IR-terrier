	<detailed_description>Background : Empty Nose Syndrome ( ENS ) term use describe condition result resection nasal turbinate . Symptoms include depression , dysosmia , bleeding , discharge , crust , dryness , dysosmia , pain .

This involve injection botulinum toxin type A dilator nasalis muscle thus collapse internal nasal valve provide add resistance air flow . Objective : To evaluate effectiveness botulinum toxin type A improve overall quality life ENS patient . Methods : ENS patient study receive botulinum toxin type A along adjunctive treatment include several measure . First , patient give nasal rinse bottle instructed irrigate nose twice day follow : - Irrigate nose 250cc ( 125cc side ) clear mucus . - Stop gently clear nose . - Irrigate nose 250cc ( 125cc side ) . - Sit quietly 10 minute . No blowing . - Do blow nose 2 hour . Patients ask use sesame oil day prevent dry nasal mucosa administration need .
