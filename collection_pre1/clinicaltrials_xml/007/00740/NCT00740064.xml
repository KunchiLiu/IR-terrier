	<brief_title>Pilot Study With Isentress ( Raltegravir ) Epzicom ( Abacavir/Lamivudine ) Treatment Naive HIV-Infected Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This single-arm , multicenter , open-label , pilot study evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability RTG BID ABC/3TC QD . A total 30 subject enrol 3 U.S. site . - The study include 30-day screening period , treatment period ( baseline week 48 ) , follow-up visit , 2 4 week last study visit , need resolve ongoing AEs confirm virologic status . Virologic failure ( VF ) define either virologic non-response virologic rebound . Virologic failure confirm 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA level take least 2 week apart accord follow definition : - virologic rebound define HIV-1 RNA level ≥400 copies/mL initial response HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL &gt; 1 log10 copies/mL increase nadir ; - virologic non-response defined HIV-1 RNA &gt; 400 copies/mL week 24 . - Subjects discontinue study virologic failure confirm . When subject suspect virologic failure , confirmatory HIV-1 RNA must perform unscheduled visit 2 week 4 week initial assessment , plasma sample collect resistance testing . - Subjects experience symptom consistent clinically suspect ABC HSR must permanently discontinue ABC/3TC , allow substitute study-provided fixed-dose combination ZDV/3TC 150/300 mg ( COMBIVIR® ) BID ABC/3TC remain study .</detailed_description>

Double barrier contraception ( male condom/spermicide , male condom/diaphragm , diaphragm/spermicide ) ; Any intrauterine device ( IUD ) publish data show expected failure rate le 1 % per year ( IUDs meet criterion ) ; Any method publish data show low expected failure rate method le 1 % per year . Men woman age ( ≥18 year ) . Ability willingness subject give write informed consent . Screening HIV1 genotype indicate presence follow mutation : K65R , L74V , Y115F combination two thymidine analog mutation ( M41L , D67N , K70R , K219Q E ) include change either L210 T215 , associate ABC 3TC resistance , mutation Q148H/R/K N155H associate RTG resistance . Currently pregnant breastfeeding . Hepatitis B infection chronic viral replication ( HBsAg+ ) . Presence serious medical condition , include limited congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy cardiac dysfunction , opinion investigator would compromise safety subject . Use immunomodulators ( e.g. , interleukin , interferon , cyclosporine ) , HIV vaccine , systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy , investigational therapy within 30 day prior study entry . NOTE : Use corticosteroid acute therapy PCP permit . Prednisone daily dose 10 mg less ( physiologic replacement dose ) short course corticosteroid therapy ( ≤ 10 day ) permit . Known allergy/sensitivity study drug formulation . Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion site investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . Illnesses determine serious site investigator , ( i.e . require systemic treatment and/or hospitalization ) subject either complete therapy clinically stable therapy , least 7 day prior study entry . Requirement medication allow take study treatment . Current imprisonment involuntary incarceration medical facility psychiatric physical ( e.g . infectious disease ) illness .</criteria>
