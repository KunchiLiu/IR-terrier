	<brief_title>Bioavailability Flavonoids Phenolic Acids From Cranberry Juice Cocktail Healthy Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cranberries particularly rich source phenolic acid polyphenols , particularly flavonoid . Among 20 commonly consume fruit American diet , cranberry high total phenol content . Health benefit attribute cranberry include prevention urinary tract infection stomach ulcer well improve oral hygiene . These benefit appear due principally ability cranberry interfere adhesion bacteria select cell type surface . Cranberries cranberry constituent , include several phenolic polyphenolic compound , also show possess antibacterial , antiviral , anti-mutagenic , anti-carcinogenic , anti-tumorigenic , anti-angiogenic , antioxidant activity . Most evidence derive vitro study animal model . The limited number human study available indicate phytochemical bioavailable bioactive . However , information require bioavailability metabolism cranberry polyphenols , well relationship cranberry dose duration use , good understand impact risk factor chronic disease .</detailed_description>
