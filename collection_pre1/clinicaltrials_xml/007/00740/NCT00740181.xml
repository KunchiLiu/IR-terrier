Patients fungal lung infection must treatment least one month proof regression prior enrollment . Patients may antimicrobials time therapy . Initial require laboratory value : Total Bilirubin &lt; 2 X upper limit normal . AST &amp; ALT &lt; 3 X upper limit normal ( elevate liver enzymes think likely due Leukemic infiltrate discus Principal Investigator BrUOG Central Office ) . Creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl . &lt; 15,000 K/uI blast countâ€”Hydroxyurea use decrease count 15,000 K/ul . Patients must ECOG performance status 02 . Patients must receive sign full informed consent . Patients coexist medical illness would limit survival &lt; 12 week . No known history HIV . The safety decitabine human pregnancy unknown . Based animal study , decitabine may cause fetal harm administer pregnant woman . Therefore , important become pregnant father child receive study medication 2 month afterwards drug study may affect unborn baby . If woman capable become pregnant ( surgically sterile postmenopausal ) , must negative pregnancy test begin treatment . If become pregnant , suspect pregnant , partner becomes pregnant study , must notify study doctor immediately . If become pregnant , take study . In addition , must breast feed time study since drug take may also affect child . If capable give birth father child , must agree use form birth control ( example effective birth control : condom diaphragm spermicidal jelly ; oral , injectable , implanted birth control ; abstinence ) medically acceptable study doctor take part research study .</criteria>
