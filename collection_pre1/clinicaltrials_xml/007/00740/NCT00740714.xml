	<brief_title>Effects Coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ ) Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson disease ( PD ) progressive neurodegenerative disease affect 1,000,000 Americans . Currently proven therapy reduce rate progression PD . In previous phase II clinical trial , investigator demonstrate Coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ ) dosages 300 , 600 , 1200 mg/day safe well-tolerated individual early , untreated PD . The finding also suggest CoQ may slow progressive impairment PD measure Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) . In study , researcher conduct randomize , placebo-controlled , phase III trial CoQ confirm extend result earlier phase II study . The primary objective trial compare effect two dosage CoQ ( 1200 2400 mg/day ) placebo total UPDRS score people early PD . The study also evaluate independent function , cognition , quality life . Plasma CoQ level measure month 1 , 8 16 correlate change UPDRS score . Participants randomly assign receive placebo ( inactive substance ) , 1200 mg/d CoQ , 2400 mg/d CoQ . They evaluate screening , baseline , visit month 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 . Information gain trial could lead change management people early PD .</detailed_description>
