	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Activity GS-9450 Adults With Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , parallel group , placebo control , multicenter study investigate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics activity multiple oral dos GS 9450 adult NASH . Approximately 110 subject 18 75 year age elevate ALT ( &gt; 60 U/L screening ) , fatty liver screen ultrasound , biopsy-proven NASH randomize ( 1:1:1:1:1 ) one five parallel treatment group ( 22 subject per treatment group ) follow : GS-9450 1mg mouth ( PO ) daily , GS-9450 5 mg PO daily , GS-9450 10 mg PO daily , GS-9450 40 mg PO daily , Matching placebo PO daily Qualifying subject stratify presence/absence type 2 diabetes ( i.e. , on/off oral diabetic medication entry ) geographic region ( US France ) . Following randomization , subject return within five business day later baseline visit , time dispense study medication enter 4-week treatment phase . Upon completion treatment phase , subject enter 4 week off-treatment follow-up period . Each subject 's participation study last approximately 12 week ( inclusive screening , treatment phase , off-treatment follow-up period ) .</detailed_description>
