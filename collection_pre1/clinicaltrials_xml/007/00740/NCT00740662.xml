	<brief_summary>An important step gastric bypass operation treatment morbid obesity measure small bowel length . At several reoperations find length increase low part small intestine 80 % compare measured length initial operation . On one hand , reflect normal technical error small bowel measure due variable state contraction bowel , hand , could also due compensatory increase intestinal length operation . New protocol allow measure small bowel length MRI . Comparing preoperative later several postoperative measurement MRI initial intraoperative length measure allow validate new MRI protocol time quantify eventual small bowel length increase .

	<brief_title>Intraoperative Measuring Small Bowel Length Compared Measuring Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Morbid Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : An important step gastric bypass operation treatment morbid obesity measure small bowel length order define lengths alimentary , biliopancreatic common channel . The measure technically simple always error due variable state contraction small bowel . In distal gastric bypass common channel length 100 150 cm choose induces iatrogenic short bowel syndrome . At several reoperations find length increase common channel 80 % compare measured length initial operation . Former study seem indicate adaptation small bowel length may occur animal short bowel syndrome intestinal bypass surgery . Longterm result gastric bypass surgery often show weight regain 3 5 year could due afore mentioned compensatory mechanism . Newer MRI protocols allow non-invasive measurement small bowel length . Comparing preoperative later several postoperative measurement MRI initial intraoperative length measure allow validate new MRI protocol time quantify eventual small bowel length increase . Objective : In-vivo verification small bowel length measurement make MRI , quantification possible increase common channel length long run distal gastric bypass . Methods : The preoperative small bowel length measurement MRI compare length measure intraoperatively . MRIs discharge postoperatively well 6 12 month use detect eventual increase common channel length .</detailed_description>
