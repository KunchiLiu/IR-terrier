Some people COPD excess mucus lung , possibly cause overactive immune response , lead cough shortness breath . Although cigarette smoking seem make symptom bad , researcher sure occur people others . This study examine compare blood lung tissue sample smoker nonsmoker without COPD determine physiological difference , environmental factor , gene , biomarkers contribute development symptom associate COPD . Before scheduled lung resection surgery , participant study attend one study visit . It last approximately 1 2 hour consist answer question medical history , fill health questionnaire , provide blood sample . After surgery , study researcher take lung tissue remove examine laboratory . Participants contact study staff , examine lung tissue , researcher discover participant medical disorder current treatment stop improve . Also , participant contact end study answer brief question health .</detailed_description>
