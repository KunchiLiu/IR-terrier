	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness , Safety , Tolerability Carisbamate Add-On Therapy Patients With Partial Onset Seizures .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According World Health Organization ( WHO ) , epilepsy afflict 50 million people worldwide . Older antiepileptic drug still commonly use , despite diverse range side effect . New AEDs approve since early 1990s show improved tolerability profile . Nonetheless , approximately 30 % patient , particularly partial onset seizure , well control even new treatment experience significant side effect secondary treatment . Therefore , development new drug effectiveness safety tolerability advantage currently market antiepileptic drug need . This randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician patient know name assign study medication ) , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter study . The study 3 phase : 8-week pretreatment phase include screen baseline period , 14-week double blind treatment phase , include 2-week titration period 12-week maintenance period , 4 week posttreatment phase . During 56-day baseline period , patient require least 6 partial onset seizure , &gt; = 100 partial onset seizure per 28 day , seizure-free period 3 week eligible enter double-blind treatment phase study . During double-blind treatment phase study CARISEPY3013 , patient randomly assign receive 800 mg/day carisbamate , 1,200 mg/day carisbamate , placebo 14 week . The total duration study CARISEPY3013 approximately 26 week subject . Patients complete double-blind treatment phase eligible enter separate extension study CARISEPY3014 . Safety assessment include monitoring frequency , severity , time adverse event , clinical laboratory test result , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) recording , vital sign measurement , physical neurologic examination , Physician Withdrawal Checklist symptom withdrawal patient taper and/or discontinue study drug , pregnancy test females childbearing potential . Assessments effectiveness include seizure count every visit Quality Life Epilepsy-31 Patient Inventory questionnaire . A Medical Resource utilization questionnaire use obtain cost-effectiveness information carisbamate . The study hypothesis carisbamate superior placebo add-on therapy ( i.e. , addition current antiepileptic drug patient take ) treatment partial onset seizure patient epilepsy . Carisbamate 800 mg/day , 1,200 mg/day , placebo take twice daily 2 equally divided dos , without food , take noncarbonated water . A double-dummy design use patient take number active drug placebo tablet day 14 week double blind treatment phase . Patients continue take stable dosage dosages 3 antiepileptic drug already take seizure entire study .</detailed_description>

To eligible doubleblind treatment phase study CARISEPY3013 , patient must : least 6 partial onset seizures 56day baseline period Have &gt; = 100 partial onset seizure per 28 day baseline period And seizurefree period 3 week baseline period .
