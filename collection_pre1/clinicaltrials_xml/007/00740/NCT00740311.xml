	<brief_summary>After dental extraction , osseous alveolus fill naturally blood clot transform month later osseous tissue . Even alveolar wall remain intact end intervention , heal always come along physiological reduction level site . The reduction alveolar crest continuous , cumulative inexorable phenomenon This reduction entail long term aesthetic functional damage complicate prosthetic rehabilitation dental articulate . That prosthetic rehabilitation removable fix , implanto-carried , make difficult less comfortable patient . In oral surgery , certain pathology require treatment use material fill generate activity reduction / osseous replacement end formation physiological calcify neo-tissue . Numerous product osseous replacement already use realize alveolar filling avoid inevitable strongly harmful osseous loss.The purpose present study quantify physiological osseous loss due dental extraction without fill randomize study calibrate criterion evaluation . The current standard care filling ( heal blood clot ) know consecutive osseous loss age . The technique fill osseous substitute use Europe Asia decrease osseous loss . At first , substitute constitute bone graft ( autograft , allograft , xenograft ) tend replace synthetic material . To realize filling accord country , various material use ( bovine bone , coral , bio glass , phosphate calcium ) . The used synthetic material calcium ortho phosphate , composition close mineral phase calcify tissue . Ceramic phosphate calcium particularly Biphasic Phosphate Calcium ( BCP ) already use numerous clinical applications.We choose study MBCP gel â„¢ , product beforehand use 2 clinical study Nantes University Hospital sponsor.The perspective study able propose systematization alveolar fill able decrease osseous reduction extraction able propose functional prosthetic rehabilitation ( improvement masticatory power ) , aesthetic comfortable . When know effect nutrition due masticator difficulty notably age person , measure importance major problem Public health .</brief_summary>
