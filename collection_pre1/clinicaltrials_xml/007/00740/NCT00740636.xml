As part study , additional test may help u understand temozolomide work . First , tumor sample biopsy do past , analyze abnormal gene may present lung cancer . Before start temozolomide , research blood test do look abnormal gene look tumor sample . Also , start temozolomide every time repeat CT scan , research blood test do analyze number tumor cell bloodstream .</brief_summary>
