	<brief_title>Basic Balance : Logan Basic Technique Bilateral Weight Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postural imbalance cause abnormal weight distribution body may cause discomfort , pain deformity . In human body , weight resistance gravity control bone make skeletal system support ligament tendon . Without framework hold upright , would fall ground due external force gravity . When one half body must work hard support weight , half body great imbalance may become strained . As result imbalance , strain tension increase cause decrease blood supply decrease proper exchange waste , nutrient , oxygen cause increase toxicity . According Logan Basic Methods textbook , long remain symptom strain muscle tissue result abnormality body framework , muscle capable , slight assistance , restore subluxated attachment normal relationship . The slight force exert either attachment , directly indirectly , tend approximate point attachment result decrease strain muscle . Therefore , necessary amount force apply improve postural distortion dependent upon nature degree patient 's postural distortion muscular imbalance . The system Logan Basic Methods use structural analysis radiography combine postural clinical examination finding determine apply specific low-force adjustment pelvis spine . The commonly apply contact Logan Basic Technique , apex contact , specifically contact sacrotuberous ligament , connect ischial tuberosity anterior aspect sacrum , attach sacrum . This ligament believe play integral role stability pelvis , especially nutation counter-nutation . This evidence study function long dorsal sacroiliac ligament , sacrotuberous ligament play significant role counter-balancing pelvis nutation counter-nutation . The Midot Postural Analyzer QPS-200 provide data regard weight distortion actual body weight within 360 degree radius , two dimensional plane . Similar study perform Logan student past . The first study find , 1990 , design double blind study apex contact sham adjustment give participant attempt determine affect Logan Basic Technique leg length deficiency balance . Only one adjustment give participant . Results inconclusive , favorable result intervention . Another similar study perform 1996 Goutlet , Webb , Lawson guidance Dr. Brian Snyder double blind study use apex contact experimental intervention sham adjustment control group . The researcher use two common bathroom scale data collection . A positive correlation find weight distribution change pre-post adjustment experimental group , one treatment give subject study .</detailed_description>
