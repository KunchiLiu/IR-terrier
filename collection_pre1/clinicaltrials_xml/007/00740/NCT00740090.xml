	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety immune response child experimental malaria vaccine call AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® ( Registered Trademark ) + CPG 7909 . Malaria infection red blood cell cause parasite , Plasmodium falciparum , spread certain kind mosquito . It affect least 300 million people worldwide year , 1 million death , mostly among child le 5 year age sub-Saharan Africa . Malaria lead cause death illness among general population Mali West Africa . Increasing drug resistance P. falciparum widespread resistance mosquito pesticide reduce ability control disease strategy . AMA1 C1 make synthetic protein similar P. falciparum protein . It combine Alhydrogel CPG 7909 , substances added vaccine make work well . Children 1 4 year age live Bancoumana , Mali , general good health may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Participants randomly assign receive three injection ( shot ) either AMA1-C1 control rabies inactivate vaccine call Imovax® ( Registered Trademark ) . The shot give thigh muscle study day 0 , 56 180 . After shot , participant observe clinic 30 minute . They return clinic physical examination six seven time shot four time 9-month period last shot . Blood sample draw several visit check side effect vaccine measure response . The total duration study 21 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Globally , Plasmodium falciparum parasite responsible least 300 million acute case malaria year , 1 million death . Approximately 90 percent death , majority child 5 year age , occur Africa due infection Plasmodium falciparum . Morbidity mortality cause malaria also significant direct indirect cost economic development endemic country . It estimate malaria account 40 percent public health expenditure , 30 percent inpatient admission , approximately 50 percent outpatient visit African country . These factor , well grow drug resistance parasite , widespread resistance mosquito insecticide , increase human travel necessitate need new approach malaria control eradication . A vaccine could reduce mortality morbidity secondary Plasmodium falciparum infection would valuable resource fight disease . Over time , people live endemic area develop natural immunity Plasmodium falciparum result repeat infection . Consequently , child survive 7 10 year age rarely succumb life-threatening disease despite frequent infection . This acquire immunity mediate part blood-stage parasite-specific antibody . Thus , parasite protein express blood-stage propose good candidate inclusion vaccine . The purpose blood-stage vaccine elicit immune responses either destroy parasite blood stream inhibit parasite infecting red blood cell , thus reduce prevent complication disease . A number Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigen identify promising blood-stage vaccine candidate , include Apical Membrane Antigen 1 ( AMA1 ) . The precise role AMA1 parasite unknown ; however , critical erythrocyte invasion process across divergent Plasmodium species blood-stage multiplication parasite . Recent analysis Plasmodium falciparum proteome detected expression AMA1 sporozoite stage suggest additional role AMA1 liver-stage invasion . Therefore , immune response AMA1 may effect liver-stage parasite well impact blood-stage parasite , thus protect host multiple immune mechanism . Human animal anti-AMA1 antibody inhibit merozoite invasion vitro correlate protection parasite challenge animal model . T-cells specific Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 also demonstrate individual live endemic area . At least 68 know amino acid polymorphism AMA1 demonstrate , animal study show polymorphism AMA1 immunologically silent . The combination two divergent AMA1 sequence within single vaccine formulation may reduce evasion host immune response Plasmodium falciparum field isolates .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Males female age great equal 1 less 4 year Known resident village Bancoumana , Mali surround area Good general health determine mean screen procedure Available duration trial ( 24 month enrollment ) Willingness child participate study evidence parents/legal guardian sign fingerprinting informed consent document EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Evidence clinically significant neurologic , cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic , rheumatologic , chronic infectious renal disease history , physical examination , and/or laboratory study include urinalysis . Behavioral , cognitive , psychiatric disease opinion investigator affect ability volunteer parent/legal guardian understand cooperate study protocol . Preexisting know autoimmune disease include limited : systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis , Sjogren 's syndrome , autoimmune thrombocytopenia . Laboratory evidence possible autoimmune disease determine antidsDNA titer equal exceed 25 IU . Laboratory evidence liver disease ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] great upper limit normal test laboratory ) . Laboratory evidence renal disease ( serum creatinine great upper limit normal test laboratory , trace protein blood urine dipstick test confirm repeat testing ) . Laboratory evidence hematologic disease ( absolute leukocyte count le 3000/mm ( 3 ) great 14,500/mm ( 3 ) , absolute lymphocyte count le 1000/mm ( 3 ) , platelet count le 120,000/mm ( 3 ) , hemoglobin less 8.5 g/dL ) . Other condition , opinion investigator , would jeopardize safety right volunteer participate trial would render subject unable comply protocol .
