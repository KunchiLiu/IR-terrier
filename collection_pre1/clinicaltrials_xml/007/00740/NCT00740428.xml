	<detailed_description>Urinary incontinence involuntary loss urine . During gestation , hormonal mechanical factor favor incidence urinary loss may persist delivery 50 % woman . Gestational urine loss prevent treated pregnancy physical therapy . Pregnancy delivery widely deem important risk factor assess develop preventive curative treatment female urinary incontinence pelvic floor muscle dysfunction . Pelvic floor muscle exercise , lead skilled physical therapist , prevent , reduce , even cure involuntary urine loss well pelvic floor muscle dysfunction . Within framework , develop low-cost , easy-to-perform method treatment urinary incontinence pelvic floor muscle dysfunction , preventive curative approach , consider necessary . The overall objective study assess effect pelvic floor exercise pregnancy pelvic floor muscle urinary continence . Secondary aim include determine whether exercise change pelvic floor muscle function ; change pelvic floor muscle function reduces occurrence urinary incontinence ; develop apply manual guide ; determine whether physical therapy guide well accept , easily understandable reproducible . Thus , 58 consent primipregnants age 20 35 year , experience urinary loss episode gestation assess . They allocate 2 group : G-I : pregnants first time receive physical therapy guide , perform exercise supervision physical therapist , complete exercise compliance form log information urinary loss ; G-II : pregnants first time complete urinary loss log without receive physical therapy guide performing exercise . Meetings participant take place 6 occasion throughout pregnancy : 18 , 22 , 26 , 30 , 34 38 week gestation . At 18 week , participant ask respond baseline questionnaire overall specific gestational data . They also question urine loss episode past 30 day , whether urine loss start pregnancy . In addition , undergo pelvic floor evaluation Pelvic Floor Functional Assessment ( PFFA ) , perineometry Portable PerinaStim perineometer . G-I woman teach perineal contraction receive exercise guide perineal contraction 4 different position . These woman instruct write exercise frequency compliance form well occurrence urinary incontinence urinary loss log . In 6 meeting , G-I G-II participant reassess PFFA perineometry , ask provide complete urinary loss log . G-I participant also request provide complete exercise compliance form perform sequence exercise include guide supervision physical therapist . During meeting , note make exercise compliance form check later add baseline form participant . The performance pelvic floor exercise gestation expect positive effect pelvic floor muscle urinary continence . Pelvic floor muscle function expect improve reduce occurrence gestational urinary incontinence . In addition , physical therapy guide expect well accept , understandable reproducible . The result obtain study intend help clinical practice open new research line may significantly contribute woman 's health .</detailed_description>
