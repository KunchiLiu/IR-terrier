	<brief_title>Fall Prevention : Dynamic Posturographic Measurements Geriatric Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computerized dynamic posturography outcome obtain geriatric subject attend September , 2008 AARP meeting Washington , DC . All subject volunteer . The outcome measurement obtain use computerized dynamic posturography , standard diagnostic test balance function . The subject 's balance test use three-component force platform ( CAPS test ) one sensory condition modify Clinical Test Sensory Interaction Balance ( mCTSIB ) , eye close without perturbation . This condition choose study show single test best correlate balance impairment fall . The stability score , already use several study author use primary outcome measure research . It define 1 minus ratio measure sway test ( computed major axis standard 95 % confidence ellipse ) amount sway normal subject height one test able sway fall ( also know theoretical maximum sway theoretical limit stability , calculate use regression formula base subject 's height develop NASA 1962 commonly use posturographic test ) . For convenience , stability score express percentage . Its definition make convenient easy understand measure use subject able stand perfectly still sway score 100 % , whereas one sway much limit stability score 0 % . During test , subject 's sway determine force platform relate software . The CAPS three-component force platform use 3 load cell arrange triangle measure distribution vertical ground reaction force platform . The analog load cell signal amplify simultaneously sample platform electronics use three synchronize individual 24-bit delta-sigma analog digital converter sample 312 kHz decimate sample data rate 64 Hz . The use three A/D converter insure signal 3 load cell acquire simultaneously time error . The high sampling rate high decimation low data rate sigma-delta converter eliminate aliasing provide resolution 4 part per million . The digital load cell data send via USB connection PC software use calibration matrix determine manufacturer compute total vertical force two horizontal moment act platform . From data , software compute point application vertical force act platform , commonly refer Center Pressure ( CoP ) . The location CoP coincide static condition projection subject 's Center Mass ( CoM ) onto platform , movement relate movement subject 's CoM ( sway ) . The determination actual sway require determination instantaneous location CoM via location inertial property body segment specific subject test . The CAPS test , like posturographic equipment , use movement CoP approximation sway . Because approximation , kinetic reason CoP move CoM , 95 % confidence interval CoP motion consider . This allow CAPS software compute ellipse represent location sway sample collect test 95 % confidence . The major axis ellipse represent maximum sway subject direction test use compute stability score . To assess accuracy resolution measurement chain , calibrate weight 75 kg 100 kg position center force platform ( subject ) 20 sec acquisition perform : The accuracy weight must fall within instrument 's factory specification ( +2N ) . Therefore accuracy position claim manufacturer +1 mm weight 75 kg accept correct determination would require specialized equipment software available manufacturer . It note overall accuracy position CoP give instrument relevant study motion CoP determine sway . The sway measurement error estimate consider fact test weight dead weight move , measurement chain indicate `` sway '' le 0.05 mm ( measurement noise ) , therefore resolution measurement chain sway measurement error consider 0.05 mm . To verify repeatability measurement chain , type test repeat two time . The author obtain similar result ( within specify accuracy resolution ) another study . Given sway measurement error , measurement error stability score determine . From definition stability score clear least theoretical limit stability , pronounced effect sway measurement error . As theoretical limit stability compute use formula 0.556height626sin ( 6.258 ) , short subject , stability score sensitive measurement error . To estimate stability score measurement error subject 's height 1.6 consider . Such subject would theoretical limit stability 191.6 mm . For subject , sway measurement error 0.05 mm mean stability score measurement error 0.05/191.6 , score express percentage , 0.026 % . Thus , change stability score great consequence subject 's sway measurement error . A CAPS sit stand test subject ask stand force platform sit position follow posturography test eye close stance obtain subject . Subjects instructed sit chair stand without use hand structure support . They wil instructed stand computerize force plate platform without pertubation close eye data obtain computerized force plate . The subject give practice session familiar test prior collection data . The CAPS testing , include sit stand eye close stand test occur 90 sec . We divide degree sway observe first half eye close stand test ( 10 second ) second half eye close stand test ( 10 second ) obtain ratio . If subject sway increase second half test reference first half call fatigability ratio . When individual demonstrate less sway second half test call adaptability ratio consider might relate type motor learning .</detailed_description>
