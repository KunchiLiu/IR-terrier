	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give umbilical cord blood transplant together cyclophosphamide , fludarabine phosphate , total-body irradiation ( TBI ) work treat patient hematologic disease . Giving chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide fludarabine phosphate , TBI donor umbilical cord blood transplant help stop growth cancer abnormal cell help stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's stem cell . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . Sometimes transplanted cell donor make immune response body 's normal cell . Giving cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil transplant may stop happening .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant , Cyclophosphamide , Fludarabine Phosphate , Total-Body Irradiation Treating Patients With Hematologic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine one year survival patient undergoing umbilical cord blood transplantation ( UCBT ) myeloablative preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide ( CY ) , fludarabine ( FLU ) , fractionate total body irradiation ( TBI ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Incidence transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) 6 month . II . Chimerism multiple time point . III . Incidence neutrophil engraftment day 42 . IV . Incidence platelet engraftment 6 month . V. Incidence acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) grade II-IV grade III-IV day 100 . VI . Incidence chronic GVHD day 100 , 1 year 2 year . VII . Incidence clinically significant infection 6 month , 1 year 2 year . VIII . Incidence disease free survival 1 2 year . IX . Incidence relapse 1 2 year . OUTLINE : Patients receive myeloablative conditioning comprise fludarabine phosphate intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day -8 -6 , cyclophosphamide IV day -7 -6 , undergo TBI twice daily ( BID ) day -4 -1 . Patients undergo single- double-unit UCBT day 0 . Patients receive GVHD prophylaxis comprise cyclosporine IV 1 hour every 8 12 hour , cyclosporine orally ( PO ) ( tolerate ) , day -3 100 taper day 101 . Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV every 8 hour day 0 7 PO ( tolerate ) three time daily ( TID ) day 8-30 . Mycophenolate mofetil taper BID day 30 7 day engraftment acute GVHD , discontinue day 45 engraftment continue evidence acute GVHD . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month , 1 year , 2 year .</detailed_description>
