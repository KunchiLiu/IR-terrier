	<brief_summary>This study test use new device call segmental stiffening wire ( SSW ) colonoscopy correct problem call looping . Colonoscopy best test detect early colon cancer remove growth call polyp , become colon cancer . Sometimes flexible tube ( colonoscope ) use procedure loop certain point advance colon , make difficult move cause patient pain excessive stretching colon . The SSW design prevent stiffen part tube would otherwise form loop . Healthy subject 50 80 year age healthy subject 40 year old family history colon cancer may eligible study . Participants undergo colonoscopy day self-administering bowel cleanse preparation . The first part procedure do similarly flexible sigmoidoscopy , sedation pain medication use . The colonoscope insert rectum advance one-third length colon . Pain discomfort mild moderate cramping feel move bowel . The subject ask score pain level point use standard pain scale . If pain , procedure stop x-ray take determine colonoscope loop . If , loop undone SSW use . Another x-ray take document loop prevent SSW , procedure complete per standard medical practice . Subjects take recovery area , inform test result discharge home care accompany adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy challenge perform painful due loop colonoscope . Looping occurs insertion colonoscope result loop form shaft colonoscope instead advancement tip . Attempts make solve problem , date perfect solution . Since colonoscopy gold standard colon cancer screen provide device could prevent loop would valuable . We develop experimental device approve outside context study know Segmental Stiffening Wire ( SSW ) . This wire utilize pass biopsy channel endoscope . The wire 15-25 inch area increase thickness stiffness . The stiffened section advance area loop effort prevent re-looping . We conduct pilot study two phase . The first phase include approximately 10 healthy volunteer undergo colonoscopy use SSW . Fluoroscopy use determine device prevents re-looping . If phase 1 device successful 30 % episode , second phase undertaken . In second phase volunteer willing undergo two colonoscopy consecutive day recruit . Volunteers experience loop randomize whether SSW available . These volunteer undergo otherwise identical colonoscopy follow day except SSW available first colonoscopy available first colonoscopy . Volunteers undergo two colonoscopy need second bowel preparation maintain clear liquid diet two procedure . Volunteers loop occur initial colonoscopy complete normal leave study . If unable obtain sufficient volunteer willing undergo dual colonoscopy , volunteer willing undergo single colonoscopy include procedure do without SSW random fashion . The endpoint cecal intubation time ; cecal intubation rate ; quantity sedation/analgesia ; number ancillary maneuver ; pain/sedation measure Visual Analog Pain Scale , Ramsey Sedation Scale , clinical observation ; vital sign change ; endoscopists subjective assessment procedure difficulty usefulness SSW .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Colonoscopy indicate base wellestablished national guideline . This include volunteer age 50 great average risk colon cancer , volunteer age 40 great increase risk base personal history colon polyp family history colon polyp cancer .
