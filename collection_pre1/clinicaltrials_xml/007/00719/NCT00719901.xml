	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose recommend phase II dose obatoclax mesylate give combination bortezomib patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate response rate ( complete response , partial response , good partial response ) patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration progression-free overall survival patient . II . To evaluate incidence toxicity regimen patient . III . To explore utility genetic marker base initial evidence predictive drug responsiveness and/or successful target inhibition . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , dose-escalation study obatoclax mesylate follow phase II study . Patients receive obatoclax mesylate IV 3 hour bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
