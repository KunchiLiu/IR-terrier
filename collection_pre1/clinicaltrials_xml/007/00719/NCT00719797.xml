	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , oxaliplatin , leucovorin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial compare two combination chemotherapy regimens give together bevacizumab see well work first-line therapy treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare progression-free survival bevacizumab combination oxaliplatin , irinotecan hydrochloride , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium ( FOLFOXIRI ) versus bevacizumab combination irinotecan hydrochloride , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium ( FOLFIRI ) patient unresectable , metastatic colorectal cancer . Secondary - To evaluate safety profile , include long-term adverse event regimens patient . - To compare overall response rate , duration response , secondary R0 surgery rate metastases overall survival treatment arm . - To evaluate potential surrogate marker predictive bevacizumab activity . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1-2 ) , prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( yes v ) , participate center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( FOLFOXIRI ) : Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV 1 hour , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , bevacizumab IV day 1 . Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously 48 hour begin day 1 . - Arm II ( FOLFIRI ) : Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV 1 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , bevacizumab IV day 1 . Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously 48 hour begin day 1 . In arm , treatment repeat every 2 week 12 course . Treatment bevacizumab , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo serum extraction blood sample collection periodically genotyping study . Patients also undergo collection tumoral section paraffin embed primary and/or metastatic lesion periodically immunohistochemical analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 8 week .</detailed_description>
