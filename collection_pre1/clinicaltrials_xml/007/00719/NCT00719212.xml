	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed ovarian epithelial ( include fallopian tube primary peritoneal ) carcinoma . Baseline paraffin embed tissue patient 's primary diagnosis request study enrollment forward designated central laboratory . In patient measurable disease sufficient ascites , fresh frozen tissue ascites fluid obtain needle biopsy submit designated central laboratory . Prior treatment 1 treatment regimen primary treatment set . Platinumsensitive disease define recurrence progression disease &gt; 6 month AND &lt; 24 month completion prior platinum base chemotherapy . Female &gt; 18 year age legal age . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 . Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . Subjects nonmeasurable disease biochemical recurrence eligible provide CA 125 elevate 2 time upper limit normal , confirm two successive sample , draw least one week apart . Resolution toxic effect prior therapy ( except alopecia ) NCI CTCAE v.3.0 Grade ≤ 1 baseline laboratory value define inclusion criterion immediately . Adequate organ bone marrow function Nondiabetic patient Type 1 2 Diabetic Patients control HgbA1c &lt; 8 % fast blood glucose level &lt; 160 mg/dL Adequate coagulation parameter ( within 21 day prior registration ) , International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ≤1.5 ; Activated ProThrombin Time ( APTT ) ≤ 1.5 x ULN . More 1 prior chemotherapy regimen treatment ovarian cancer . Platinumresistant disease define recurrence progression less equal six month completion frontline platinum base chemotherapy . Anticipation need major surgical procedure ( e.g. , impend bowel obstruction , gastrointestinal perforation ) radiation therapy trial . Diagnosis second malignancy within last 5 year , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ carcinoma cervix uterus . Prior treatment investigational treatment target IGF axis include , limited , CP 751,871 , IMA12 , RO4858696 . Previous exposure AMG 479 . History hypersensitivity recombinant protein . Prior treatment humanize monoclonal antibody . Treatment chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery , blood product , investigational agent within 3 week trial enrolment . Any follow within 6 month prior trial registration : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina pectoris , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , NYHA class III IV congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis , thromboembolic event . History brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis . Patient childbearing potential evidently pregnant ( eg , positive human chorionic gonadotropin test ) breast feeding . Patient childbearing potential willing use adequate contraceptive precaution . Known active infection , antiretroviral therapy HIV disease . Known positive test chronic hepatitis B C infection . Mental condition render patient unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence trial . Refusal inability give inform consent participate trial . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , significant laboratory abnormality require investigation may cause undue risk patient 's safety , inhibit protocol participation , interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry trial .</criteria>
