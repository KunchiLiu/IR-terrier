	<brief_summary>This study explore possible cause unexplained , idiopathic , anaphylaxis . Anaphylaxis rapid , life-threatening , severe reaction occur suddenly contact allergy-causing substance , usually particular food , drug sting insect . The allergen trigger mast cell release several substance , include histamine . Histamine responsible many symptom may occur , flush , hive , swell palm sol tongue vocal cord , nasal congestion , itch tear eye , shortness breath wheezing , stomach pain , vomit , low blood pressure , loss consciousness , shock , , rarely , death . Severe episodes anaphylaxis treat epinephrine ( adrenaline ) , follow oral antihistamine steroid . In half case anaphylaxis , clear cause identify . These case call idiopathic anaphylaxis . There cure long-term preventive therapy patient recurrent episode idiopathic anaphylaxis . People 18 55 year age idiopathic anaphylaxis episode least 6 time year ( least one episode every 3 month ) may eligible study . Participants evaluate NIH Clinical Center follow test procedure : - Medical history , physical examination blood test . - Bone marrow biopsy . For test , skin hipbone outer surface hipbone numb local anesthesia . Then , needle insert hipbone small amount bone marrow drawn syringe . The needle also cut small core bone marrow , remove analysis . - Other test may need evaluation patient condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cause Unexplained Anaphylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anaphylaxis severe life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction result release mediator mast cell basophil , characterize presence cutaneous , respiratory , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal sign symptom . Although common cause anaphylaxis reaction food , pharmaceutical agent , sting insect , causative factor identify 50 % individual recurrent anaphylaxis . These individual thus say idiopathic anaphylaxis ( IA ) . The mechanistic cause IA remain uncertain , although elevate level urinary histamine , plasma histamine , serum tryptase consistent mast cell activation . This protocol focus pathogenesis IA . Subjects 13-70 year old episode unexplained anaphylaxis evaluate order correlate clinical laboratory feature typical idiopathic anaphylaxis identify genetic molecular pathway may predispose event determine signal abnormality mast cell . We plan enroll 100 subject study . We anticipate finding first step toward development novel target therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION : Subject must least 13 year age old 70 year age . Diagnosis anaphylaxis occur absence identifiable provoking agent stimulus ( Idiopathic Anaphylaxis [ IA ] ) referral physician . Patient may carry diagnosis 1A diagnosis anaphylaxis provoke identified stimulus . History anaphylaxis minimum 3 episode past year . One doctor 's office ER visit hospitalization anaphylaxis without establish etiology involvement skin and/or mucosal tissue ( e.g. , flushing , itching , hive , angioedema , tongue swell ) least one following : Elevated serum tryptase subject baseline measurement within 6 hour event . Respiratory compromise ( e.g. , dyspnea , hoarsenesslaryngeal edema , wheezebronchospasm , stridor , reduce peak expiratory flow , hypoxemia ) . Gastrointestinal symptom vomit and/or diarrhea Reduced blood pressure and/or associate symptom endorgan dysfunction ( evidence hypotonia , hypoxia , collapse , syncope incontinence ) . Letter referral prospective study participant 's refer physician , copy available medical evaluation laboratory study Able willing consider bone marrow biopsy aspirate EXCLUSION : Presence condition judgment investigator refer physician may put subject undue risk travel ( include frequent episode IA preventable premedication , acute infection , severe thrombocytopenia [ minimum platelet count 30,000 ] , significant cardiovascular disease ) Any medical condition view principal investigator would make subject unsuitable enrollment study ( advanced renal disease ) . Inability provide inform consent .</criteria>
