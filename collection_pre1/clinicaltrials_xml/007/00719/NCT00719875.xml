	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm advanced breast cancer For dose escalation phase : Patients must refractory standard therapy curative standard therapy exist , consider . For phase II : Patients histologically confirm metastatic breast cancer 2 prior chemotherapy regimens treatment metastatic breast cancer . Metastatic disease progress require palliative treatment within 4 week enrollment base clinical assessment investigator . Development new lesion increase preexist lesion bone scintigraphy , CT , MRI physical examination . Patients sole criterion progression increase biochemical marker , e.g. , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , increase symptom , eligible . No radiotherapy , treatment cytotoxic agent , treatment biologic agent within 4 week prior begin treatment study ( 6 week mitomycin nitrosoureas ) . At least 2 week must elapse prior surgery hormonal therapy . Patients must fully recover acute toxicity prior treatment cytotoxic drug , radiotherapy anticancer modality ( return baseline status note recent treatment ) . Patients persist , stable chronic toxicity prior treatment ≤ grade 1 eligible . Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) . Life expectancy great 3 month Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m² patient creatinine level institutional normal . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition vorinostat capecitabine . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Women pregnant breastfeeding exclude study . HIVpositive patient ineligible patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction antiretroviral therapy investigational agent . Patient prior treatment HDAC inhibitor . Patients receive compound HDAC inhibitorlike activity , valproic acid , antitumor therapy enroll study . Patients receive compounds indication , e.g . valproic acid epilepsy , may enroll 30day washout period .</criteria>
