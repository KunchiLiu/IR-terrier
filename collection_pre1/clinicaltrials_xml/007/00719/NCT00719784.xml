	<brief_summary>Vibration Response Imaging ( VRI ) novel technology record breath sound via pizo-electric sensor produce digital image use computer algorithm . It radiation free portable patient 's bedside . Data exist show recording normal individual differs pulmonary pathology . There also evidence recording high level inter intra-observer reliability . However , data specific VRI pattern specific pathology still need use diagnostic tool . We aim perform open label feasibility trial inpatient outpatient pulmonary patient . Bedside clinical examination chest auscultation use reference gold standard . Other diagnostic modality use part patient 's usual standard care also use comparison . Specifically breath sound progression , maximal sound energy shape/distribution presence artifactual sound use search pattern may use diagnosis . Sensitivity specificity calculate disease ( eg . asthma , emphysema , bronchiectasis , pneumonia , effusion , pneumothorax , etc )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : The measurement regional distribution breath sound intensity within human thorax respiration use computerized lung sound analysis generate interest possible diagnostic modality . Using normal breath sound distribution reference , abnormal distribution sound energy use identify potential pathological state . Vibration Response Imaging ( VRI ) utilize technology . VRI process lung sound recording generate dynamic representation sound energy distribution computer screen use grey-scale coding . Air turbulence within airway consequent vibration generate captured multiple piezoelectric contact sensor , place skin patient . The signal process band-pass ( 150-250 Hz ) filter eliminate heart sound chest wall movement . These filtered signal combine , slice 0.17 second interval , convert sequence dynamic image reflect regional sound vibration energy time axis . Lung vibration energy present screen various grey shade black maximum energy area white zero energy area . Pilot data suggest VRI distinguish breath sound normal patient intra-thoracic pathology base distinctive pattern vibration energy . Reproducibility VRI recording consistency inter-observer interpretation also document . Aim : To assess diagnostic capability Vibration Response Imaging ( VRI ) evaluation pulmonary disease ( Subjects present pulmonary inpatient outpatient ) . Chest auscultation diagnostic modality use part standard care ( eg . chest radiograph , CT scan thoracic ultrasound ) use reference gold standard compare . Methods : All adult ( ≥ 21 year old ) patient ( inpatient outpatient ) care Department Respiratory Critical Care Medicine 1/07/2008 31/05/2009 consider eligible . Children may small body sizes current standard sensor recruit . Other inclusion criterion ability provide inform consent . Exclusion criterion : Conditions prevent placement sensor oh patient back bony/chest wall deformity contagious skin condition . The presence pacemaker pregnancy also consider contraindication yet undefined safety issue associate condition . Patients sign informed consent ask sit upright back expose . Those unable sit sensor slide supine position . Recordings perform use VRI device ( Deep Breeze™ , Or Akiva , Israel ) . Forty-two sensor assemble 2 planar array place subject 's back . Each row 3 sensor hold place silicone cup couple patient 's back computer-controlled low vacuum seal . Prior application sensor , patient 's back wipe clean alcohol-free wet wipe remove perspiration dirt debris . Patients record 12 second ask breathe deeply . Forced exhalation discourage . Each 12-second recording usually include 3-4 respiratory cycle . Most patient need coach breathe technique 1-2 minute record physician . An average 2-3 recording make set ensure reproducible image could attain . The principal investigator train record interpretation Harvard University . The co-investigators train principal investigator familiar machine trial department . The VRI recording interpret study doctor Deep Breeze ( Company manufacturing VRI equipment ) scientist . None patient 's personal clinical information release Deep Breeze Pte Ltd. No additional test investigation perform patient . They receive management per standard care . The VRI recording compare standard physical examination diagnostic investigation patient would anyway . Therefore , patient pay monetary compensation participation trial . Data management Information collect described Case Report Form ( Appendix A ) . All clinical data store locked department office Principal Investigator period 2 year completion trial purpose data analysis . The patient 's VRI recording remain VRI machine also password protect . For purpose analysis , recording may download CDs send Deep Breeze . These recording contain personal information except de-identified subject code number . Statistics As exploratory trial test feasibility novel technology , basis sample size collection . An arbitrary figure 200 chosen felt achievable within trial period . We attempt correlate VRI finding physical examination diagnostic modality individual disease state depend clinical diagnosis ( e.g . asthma , bronchiectasis , pneumonia , emphysema , heart failure , effusion , pneumothorax ) hope find reliable pattern enable diagnosis solely base VRI . Sensitivity specificity calculate condition</detailed_description>
