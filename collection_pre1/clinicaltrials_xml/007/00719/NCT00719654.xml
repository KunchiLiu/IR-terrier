	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study many plasma protein alter concentration structure preeclampsia elucidation alteration add poorly understood pathophysiology preeclampsia . In study compare maternal plasma proteome early-onset severe preeclampsia versus healthy control , compare protein expression quantification maternal plasma proteome time diagnosis EOS-preeclampsia plasma proteome affect subject 48 hour post delivery verify placental expression differentially express post-translationally modified protein find plasma woman EOS-preeclampsia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alterations Plasma Proteome Early-Onset Severe Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia affect 7-10 % pregnancy directly responsible 50,000 maternal death 900,000 perinatal death year . Preeclampsia remain unpredictable incurable except premature delivery fetus . It essential well understanding preeclampsia obtain . Proteomics offer methodology identification quantification protein fraction find human plasma disease health . Since protein basic element human biology , anticipated alteration protein posttranslational modification total protein expression would indicative diagnostic disease state . Because protein recognize act messenger hormone action , act enzyme catalyze important organic reaction serve structural component human body , representative current state metabolic structural activity naive disease state . Two group patient enrol : ( 1 ) Patients EOS-preeclampsia ( N=30 ) ( 2 ) healthy patient normal pregnancy ( N=120 ) . The patient EOS-preeclampsia match ( 1:4 ) contemporaneous control patient carry singleton gestation similar gestational age . To measure change protein , compare protein blood plasma woman EOS-preeclampsia pregnancy . We also compare blood plasma healthy versus EOS-preeclamptic woman difference plasma protein . Finally , examine placental RNA patient EOS-preeclampsia healthy patient deliver 35-37 week gestation .</detailed_description>
