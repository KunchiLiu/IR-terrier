	<detailed_description>Previous literature show longer wait lumbar spine surgery negative effect patient perceive function quality life pre- post-operatively . Patients report deterioration long wait , commonly 6 month Ontario . The propose study intend evaluate impact two different educational method patient undergo lumbar spine surgery . This prospective randomized clinical trial assign patient two different educational group : one solely standard care , standard care addition presentation 10 minute educational video inform spine patient condition , treatment option , prioritization wait list post-operative care . Outcome measure assess four different questionnaire concern specific condition , pain , quality life , etc. , pre-operatively post-operatively . Providing patient accurate information may coincide positive outcome measure . The successful educational program , find study , may provide spine patient . This educational program may bring increase overall well-being spine patient positive impact quality life pre- post-operatively .</detailed_description>
