	<brief_title>Polestriding Versus Walking Subjects With Poor Leg Circulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD/PVD ) cause decreased blood flow leg . The common symptom intermittent claudication pain walk relieve rest . Walking primary treatment prescribe PAD rehabilitation . Polestriding us muscle upper low body continuous movement . Walking pole increase stride length , cadence walk speed decrease ground reaction force joint . Subjects study participate walking program without pole . Dr. Collins ' research focus physical activity intervention improve functional status person chronic illness . Several rehabilitation study test efficacy walk exercise patient PAD . Studies polestriding indicate may superior traditional walking , two method never compare . Approximately 30 % patient coronary artery disease PAD symptom .
