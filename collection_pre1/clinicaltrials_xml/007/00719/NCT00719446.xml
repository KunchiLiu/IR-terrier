	<brief_title>Evaluating Health Outcomes QOL After ALI Among Participants ALTA , OMEGA , EDEN , SAILS ARDS Network Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALI , life-threatening condition involve inflammation lung fluid accumulation air sac , typically lead low blood oxygen level respiratory failure . Common cause ALI include pneumonia , sepsis , lung trauma . Symptoms , include breathe difficulty , low blood pressure , organ failure , usually develop within 24 48 hour original injury illness . Most patient require immediate care intensive care unit ( ICU ) , main form treatment mechanical ventilation , delivers oxygen continuous level pressure damage lung . The ARDS Network ( ARDSNet ) group hospitals medical center conduct research improve treatment option people ARDS ALI . This study enroll people participate ARDSNet 's ALTA , OMEGA , EDEN , SAILS study ; study investigate new treatment improve survival reduce amount time people remain mechanical ventilation ICU ALI . It know whether ARDSNet 's treatment prolong benefit patient leave hospital . The purpose study evaluate participant ' quality life long-term health outcome receive ALTA , OMEGA , EDEN , SAILS study treatment . This study enroll participant ALTA , OMEGA , EDEN , SAILS study . ARDS Network trial participant sit approve follow-up study contact phone 6 12 month complete collection survey . These survey assess quality life , mental health , memory cognition , physical functioning , fatigue , employment health insurance status , health care utilization . At end follow-up , participant ask feedback regard experience follow-up . For participant sub-set ARDS Network study site participate study , researcher review participant ' medical record information collect ARDSNet study . Six 12 month ALI , participant attend study visit time walk ability , lung function , muscle strength measure . Weight , dietary change , change muscle fat composition also assess . Participants take part interview evaluate memory cognition . If participant attend study visit , research staff either visit participant ' home complete evaluation conduct evaluation phone .</detailed_description>
