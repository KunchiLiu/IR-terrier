	<detailed_description>Robotic therapy perform ARMin , robotic arm exoskeleton permit 3D movement proximal distal arm joint . Combined audiovisual display , device allows virtual training Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) therapeutic gaming . A patient-responsive controller enables assistance device need . Chronic stroke patient ( &gt; 6 month post stroke ) randomly assign either experimental control group . The experimental group perform task-related intensive therapy support ARMin . Therapists treat patient control group standard motor relearn therapy .</detailed_description>
