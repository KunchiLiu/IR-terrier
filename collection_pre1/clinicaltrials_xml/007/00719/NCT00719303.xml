	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study whether change diet physical activity increase length survival without return cancer ( progression-free survival ) compare usual care patient previously treat stage II , III , IV ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . A healthy diet physical activity program counseling may help patient make healthy lifestyle choice . It yet know whether change diet exercise may help increase progression-free survival patient previously treat cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diet Physical Activity Change Usual Care Improving Progression-Free Survival Patients With Previously Treated Stage II , III , IV Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine woman disease-free successfully complete primary potential consolidation/maintenance , therapy stage II-IV ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer randomize healthy lifestyle intervention , significantly increase progression-free survival compare similar woman randomize usual care comparison group . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine woman randomize study intervention improve general quality life measure General Health subscale Research Development ( RAND ) 36-Item Health Survey ( RAND-36 ) . II . To determine woman randomize study intervention improve physical bowel functioning measure Physical Functioning subscale RAND-36 Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale ( GSRS ) -Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) , compare woman randomize usual care . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess patient compliance healthy lifestyle intervention analyze biomarkers ( e.g. , total carotenoid ) baseline , 6 , 12 , 24 month . II . To explore relationship carotenoid exposure progression free survival ovarian cancer . III . To examine patient compliance healthy lifestyle intervention ass type patient likely compliant healthy lifestyle intervention whether progression-free survival good among compliant individual . IV . To explore impact intervention aspect quality life pain , role limitation due physical health emotional problem , mental health , vitality , social functioning measure corresponding subscales RAND-36 . V. To explore impact intervention bowel function measure GSRS-IBS subscales . VI . To assess association subjectively measure sleep duration/quality ( use Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale ) , anthropometric measurement , self-reported dietary energy intake among woman previously treat stage II-IV ovarian primary peritoneal cancer . VII . To assess compare telomere length rate telomere shorten ovarian cancer survivor randomize lifestyle intervention versus standard care . VIII . To assess effect intervention biomarkers metabolic health measure change circulate insulin related insulin resistance , lipids inflammation . IX . To determine intervention effect biomarkers list modified baseline central adiposity . X . To determine intervention effect biomarkers list mediated change central adiposity . XI . To evaluate change central adiposity use computerized tomography ( CT ) scan data regularly schedule , routine surveillance CT scan determine change CT-specific visceral adiposity associate change biomarkers metabolic deregulation inflammation random subsample . OUTLINE : Participants randomize 1 2 group . GROUP 1 ( LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION ) : Participants receive dietary intervention design promote increase level plasma carotenoid , control weight , ensure adequacy micronutrient intake . Participants also undergo physical activity intervention comprise moderately low aerobic regimen raise usual activity level . Participants also undergo face-to-face counseling , receive educational material counsel focused read food label estimate gram fat per serve serve size , undergo telephone counseling lifestyle intervention counselor twice week 4 week , weekly 2 week , twice month 5 month , monthly subsequent 6 month , every month 12 month . Participants complete daily fat gram step diary least three time per week . GROUP 2 ( COMPARISON LIFESTYLE ) : Participants receive study notebook contain general study-related information . Participants ask record diet physical activity provide single sample diary study notebook . Participants receive telephone contact slide scale similar intervention group , le frequent interval ( 22 versus 33 call course intervention ) . After completion study , participant follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
