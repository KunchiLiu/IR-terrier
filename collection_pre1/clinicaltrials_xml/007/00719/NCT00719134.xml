	<brief_summary>Evidence-based medicine depend distinguish pharmacological effect placebo effect randomize control trial ( RCT ) . This proposal seek rigorously investigate fundamental question concern pharmacological effect , placebo effect interaction . Relief symptom acute migraine test condition scientific experiment migraine 's evident clinical significance possibility use participant control sequential acute migraine attack . Our overall goal elucidate pharmacological effect 100 mg rizatriptan ( FDA-proven effective medication acute migraine ) effect placebo treatment modify varied knowledge and/or expectation ( `` contextual '' ) condition . Such knowledge possibility suggest potentially efficient methodology test new medication use augment enhance apparatus RCT . General Aim : To elucidate clarify pharmacological effect placebo effect , effect vary different knowledge/expectations context , mutually constitute one another interact . General Hypothesis : The measured pharmacological effect effective medication ( rizatriptan ) measure effect placebo treatment determine significantly different knowledge/expectations context .</brief_summary>
