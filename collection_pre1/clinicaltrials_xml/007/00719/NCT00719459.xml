	<detailed_description>Iron essential synthesis hemoglobin ( Hb ) maintain oxygen transport function formation physiologically important heme nonheme compound . Iron deficiency may cause blood loss dialysis , increase erythropoiesis follow administration epoetin , insufficient absorption iron gastro-intestinal tract . Most dialysis patient require intravenous iron supplementation replenish iron store . Iron sucrose used replenish body iron store patient iron deficiency chronic hemodialysis receive erythropoietin . In patient iron deficiency cause blood loss dialysis procedure , increase erythropoiesis , insufficient absorption iron gastrointestinal tract . Most hemodialysis patient require intravenous iron maintain sufficient iron store achieve maintain hemoglobin level 11-12 g/dL . Subjects fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion screen randomize receive 100 mg iron sucrose either Hospira Iron Sucrose Venofer® .</detailed_description>
