	<brief_summary>In study , use advance newly available MR image technique 3 Tesla ( include situ axial load quantitative T1rho , T2 , diffusion measurement ) assess intervertebral disc adjacent vertebra patient lumbar back pain schedule back surgery ( n=20 ) , patient degenerative disease without classic discogenic back pain ( n=10 ) , patient discectomies herniated disc ( n=5 ) , age-matched volunteer without back pain ( n=10 ) . In patient standard imaging procedure also perform , include radiograph , standard MRI 1.5 Tesla discography . All patient specimen intervertebral disc harvest surgery pathologic analysis spectroscopy specimen perform . Post-surgical findings/outcome combine discography serve standard reference identification painful disc ( ) . The diagnostic performance new technique assess painful disc evaluate . We collect disc specimen 50 patient undergo back surgery pre-surgical MR imaging . These disc specimen analyze manner specimen collect surgical patient pre-surgical MRI . This study serve pilot study large project focus advance image painful intervertebral disc . We hypothesis advanced , dedicate MR examination 3T identify painful degenerate discs patient chronic lumbar back pain .</brief_summary>
