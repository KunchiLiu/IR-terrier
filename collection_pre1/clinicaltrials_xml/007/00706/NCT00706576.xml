	<brief_title>Treatment Unresectable Hepatocellular Cancer With Opioid Growth Factor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Hepatocellular cancer ( HCC ) one prevalent cancer world . About 19,160 new case anticipate occur US 2007 . Any form chronic liver injury cirrhosis predispose development malignancy . Worldwide , common risk factor viral hepatitis ; United States source chronic liver injury cirrhosis relate alcohol use important , incidence viral hepatitis continue increase . Regardless etiology , know cure HCC surgical resection . Unfortunately , due associate liver disease stage tumor progression time diagnosis , patient candidate surgical therapy . Chemotherapy show little efficacy disease , radiation little value due associate liver toxicity . New therapy desperately need . Research examine mechanism involve growth human cancer show peptide [ Met5 ] -enkephalin , Opioid Growth Factor ( OGF ) , inhibit growth number cancer line vitro . In pancreatic cancer phenomenon well define vitro vivo transfer human tumor nude mouse . The suppressive effect growth peptide receptor-mediated mechanism . Based upon finding , phase I trial conduct study effect OGF patient pancreatic cancer . We hypothesize administration OGF inhibit course carcinogenic event human subject unresectable hepatocellular cancer cirrhosis . In order test hypothesis propose phase I trial study toxicity therapy patient suffer liver disease cirrhosis address follow specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : Determine MTD ( maximum-tolerated dose ) OGF intravenous infusion patient suffer HCC . While MTD determine patient suffer pancreatic cancer , unclear result hold true patient HCC suffer liver insufficiency cirrhosis . For reason conduct dose-finding trial contain dose-escalation OGF . Dose-limiting toxicity determine monitor liver function , pupillary size &amp; response , respiration , vital sign ( orthostatic blood pressure pulse ) , gastrointestinal distress , cutaneous flushing , effect blood count , glucose electrolyte . Specific Aim 2 : Study pharmacokinetics metabolism OGF patient HCC cirrhosis monitoring plasma OGF level . Blood sample collect prior designate interval infusion MTD OGF cancer patient . OGF plasma level analyze perform radioimmunoassay . The long-term objective research team understand effect peptide growth factor patient HCC cirrhosis . This phase I trial useful determine appropriate dose expect toxicity OGF patient . Our study employ use naturally occur opioid peptide , show inhibit growth pancreatic cancer preclinical study , safely administer patient pancreatic cancer . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common malignancy world ; five hundred thousand people succumb malignancy annually . The incidence mortality rate almost equal , demonstrate patient cure . Any form chronic liver injury cirrhosis predispose development malignancy . The major risk factor HCC chronic hepatitis B virus infection , chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , alcoholic cirrhosis . The known cure HCC surgical resection . The patient 's degree cirrhosis anatomic location tumor determine partial hepatectomy perform . Even high volume center specialize procedure , operative mortality show increase 1 % 14 % presence cirrhosis ( 1 ) . For reason , resection usually reserve patient Child 's A liver function . Multiple lesion preclude resection . Intraductal tumor cause obstructive jaundice successfully resect . In situation , important distinguish obstruction underlie liver disease cause patient 's jaundice . Total hepatectomy follow orthotropic liver transplantation sensible strategy treat patient cirrhosis cancer , experience grow approach . As expect , best result record patient small HCC discover incidentally transplantation perform liver failure . Lesions small 5 cm treat transplantation significantly well prognosis , , organs scarce , transplantation HCC u usually limit set . Mazzaferro et al report liver transplantation effective treatment small , unresectable HCC patient cirrhosis , 4-year recurrence-free survival 83 % . Unfortunately , 90 % patient suitable resection transplantation curative intent ( 2-6 ) , patient therapeutic option proven efficacy . In set prognosis extremely poor , median survival low 3 month high-incidence area ( 5-8 ) . No systemic chemotherapeutic regimen demonstrate significant efficacy . Response rate single-agent multidrug protocol , without biologic response modifier , well 20 % 30 % ( 9-12 ) randomize trial demonstrate clear survival benefit ( 13 , 14 ) . Recently , sorafenib show increase overall survival , 7.9 month 10.7 month , Child 's A patient hepatocellular cancer ( 15 ) . External radiation therapy HCC ineffective even palliation ( 9 , 16 , 17 ) dose radiation deliver tumor limited radiation hepatitis ( 18 , 19 ) . Hepatic intraarterial infusion cytotoxic agent , aim increase local concentration drug reduce systemic toxicity ( 20 ) , intraarterial embolization , cause ischemic necrosis tumor ( 21 ) , use palliative treatment either alone combination . Chemoembolization often employ basis report decrease tumor size nonrandomized trial ( 22-26 ) ; however , result multi-center randomized trial show improvement overall survival , significant morbidity therapeutic approach ( 27 ) . Clearly new therapeutic strategy need treat deadly disease . Endogenous opioid system participate growth develop cell tissue , micro-organism , tissue undergo cellular renewal , neoplastic cell tissue ( 28 , 29 ) . A thorough examination effect opioid peptide pancreatic cancer cell grow tissue culture reveal [ Met5 ] - enkephalin , pentapeptide potent peptide influence DNA synthesis growth ; view growth factor action , [ Met5 ] -enkephalin term opioid growth factor ( OGF ) . OGF interact OGFr receptor zeta ( OGFr ) influence growth . Unlike opioid receptor , function ( e.g. , growth ) , distribution ( neural non-neural ) , transient appearance ontogeny , ligand specificity ( i.e. , [ Met5 ] - enkephalin ) , competitive inhibition profile , subcellular location ( i.e. , nucleus ) , fact ligand know opioid receptor influence growth provide unique set characteristic distinguish OGFr opioid receptor . It demonstrate opioids function inhibitory growth factor human pancreatic cancer , vitro vivo ( 28 , 30 ) . [ Met5 ] -enkephalin safely use several pilot study treat human subject cancer . Wybran Schandene ( 31 ) administer [ Met5 ] -enkephalin intravenously seven previously untreated patient lung cancer find significant increase T-cell immunity ( i.e. , OK1 0 cell . Leu11 cell , natural killer cell ) . Plotnikoff colleague ( 32 ) administer [ Met5 ] -enkephalin period several month intravenous infusion dose 10 60 pg/kg body weight three time weekly human subject advance melanoma . Plotnikoff coworkers ( 33 ) Wybran coworkers ( 31 ) report improvement size coloration Kaposi 's sarcoma nodule AIDS patient . In addition , [ Met5 ] -enkephalin increase number cytotoxic T-cells NK cell involve tumor surveillance . The tumor response human study attribute [ Met5 ] -enkephalin 's action immune system ( 31 , 34 ) . Most recently , phase I study demonstrated OGF deliver safely patient suffer advanced pancreatic cancer ( 30 ) give phase II trial . Our research team demonstrate presence function Opioid Growth Factor ( OGF ) -OGF receptor ( OGFr ) system human hepatocellular carcinoma . First , immunohistochemistry stain human hepatocellular cell line SK-Hep-1 HepG2 cell reveal specific distribution OGF OGFr . Second , OGFr detect receptor binding study , find specific saturable binding single binding site , bind capacity ( Bmax ) value 12.1 +/- 2.7 fmol/mg protein 9.4 +/- 1.9 fmol/mg protein bind affinity ( Kd ) value 6.1 +/- 1.1 nM 5.8 +/- 1.5 nM SK-Hep-1 HepG2 , respectively . Third , functional assay monitor effect OGF cell number human hepatocellular carcinoma cell , statistically significant suppression cell growth find vitro SK-Hep-1 cell culture presence OGF ( appendix 10.7 ) . Based previous vitro vivo evidence pancreatic cancer , well colon cancer , neuroblastoma , squamous cell carcinoma head neck , well successful Phase I trial OGF pancreatic cancer patient , preliminary data hepatocellular carcinoma cell consistent provide rationale test OGF therapy patient hepatocellular carcinoma cirrhosis .</detailed_description>
