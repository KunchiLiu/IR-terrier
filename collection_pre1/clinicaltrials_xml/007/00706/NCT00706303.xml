Case management , patient identify contact help access care necessary , show improve outcome recent study . A combined approach , call support selfmanagement , may particularly suitable socially often educationally disadvantage group patients.We propose identify 500 patient time exacerbation test combine strategy randomise manner .

	<brief_title>Glasgow Supported Self Management Trial ( GSuST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There randomise control trial UK setting report either effect cost intensive , individualised case- self-management intervention patient COPD . Given new evidence country ( discuss ) , propose combine case- self-management ( henceforth refer `` support self-management '' ) intervention likely produce measurable benefit socially physically disadvantage group patient . Supported self-management involves : 1 . Individualised self-management education , deliver patient 's home fortnightly intervals two-month period monthly telephone follow-up .

We believe home visit critical success intervention group breathless disable patient often default clinic rehabilitation attendance account exacerbation breathlessness . 2 . To maintain impact self-management training , name nurse visit patient ( maximum interval ) six-weeks reinforce self-management message ; nurse also contactable patient , require , prompt earlier home visit , GP hospital attendance appropriate . This support self-management approach ( intervention group ) compare standard care ( control group ) . Aim : To address , via prospective randomise control trial Glasgow , whether support self-management , addition usual care , patient moderate severe COPD measurable benefit patient morbidity mortality compare usual care .</detailed_description>
