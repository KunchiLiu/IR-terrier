	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness use pegylated liposomal doxorubicin bortezomib treatment patient relapse multiple myeloma previously treat bortezomib . Multiple myeloma cancer begin plasma cell , type white blood cell . These cell part immune system , help protect body germ harmful substance . In time , myeloma cell collect bone marrow solid part bone . Multiple myeloma treatment may include stem cell transplantation , however , patient multiple myeloma candidate stem cell transplantation many patient receive transplant relapse . As result , additional first later-line therapeutic option need patient candidate transplantation , whose disease relapse transplantation therapy . Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination bortezomib approve treatment patient multiple myeloma previously receive bortezomib receive least one prior therapy . The combined use pegylated liposomal doxorubicin bortezomib study design evaluate overall response rate safety patient multiple myeloma previously treat bortezomib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Bortezomib Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Previously Treated With Bortezomib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study evaluate overall response rate DOXIL/VELCADE treatment patient relapse multiple myeloma previously treat VELCADE . Overall response rate define proportion patient achieve either complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) treatment accord European Group Blood Marrow Transplantation ( EBMT ) criterion . This single arm ( patient receive drug combination dose ) , multi-center ( many study site ) , open label ( patient physician know drug treatment receive ) approximately 60 patient multiple myeloma whose disease progress initial response VELCADE-based therapy . During 21-day treatment cycle , patient receive VELCADE intravenous bolus 4 designated day , DOXIL intravenous infusion one designate day . Treatment continue disease progression , occurrence unacceptable treatment-related toxicity total 8 cycle therapy . Drug dose may delay drop need allow platelet transfusion treatment requirement . Patients respond treatment study end may evaluate continue treatment long treatment tolerate continue respond . After discontinuation study drug , patient disease progression follow 6 month receive last dose study drug . The primary endpoint overall response rate define proportion patient achieve either complete response partial response . Response assess cycle . Safety monitor throughout study physical examination , clinical laboratory testing , incidence severity report adverse event . Overall safety summarize study-end . During 21-day treatment cycle , patient receive bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 intravenous bolus Days 1 , 4 , 8 11 pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 intravenous infusion Day 4 .</detailed_description>
