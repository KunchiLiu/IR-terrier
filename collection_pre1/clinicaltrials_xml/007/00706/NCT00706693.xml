	<brief_title>Skittles ( TM ) Effective Treating Hypoglycemia Children With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open label , randomize , cross-over design use . Each subject treat 5 hypoglycemic event glucose , 5 sucrose 5 fructose . Subjects randomized order treatment . Primary Objective : 1 . To determine sucrose fructose equally effective glucose treatment spontaneous hypoglycemia child type 1 diabetes . Secondary Objectives : 2 . To determine present hypoglycemia treatment practice child teen type 1 diabetes ( prior entry study ) . 3 . To determine preferred mode treatment hypoglycemia complete study . Inclusion Criteria : The sample consist 65 individual history type 1 diabetes ( base clinical presentation ) three month age 3 18 year . All eligible participant patient Alberta Children 's Hospital Diabetes Clinic . Exclusion Criteria : Individuals follow conditions/circumstances exclude study : - adrenal insufficiency - uncompensated hypothyroidism - clinical autonomic neuropathy - celiac disease - lack family support - unwilling unable follow study protocol - subject le 4 hypoglycemic event per month Instruments : Blood glucose measure blood glucose meter . All meter lab meter comparison perform . In accordance 1998 Clinical Practice Guidelines Diabetes Management Canada , acceptable meter value +15 % lab value ( 7 ) . Participants provide complimentary meter strip . All participant provide digital timer enable accurate 15 minute time post treatment blood glucose . A Demographic Pre-Study Data tool develop collect pre-study information ( see Appendix B ) well Low Blood Glucose Treatment Log record pre- post-treatment blood glucose result ( see Appendix C ) . Study Procedure : A letter invite participation study mail eligible participant ( see Appendix D ) . Further recruitment do clinic appointment . Six month allocate recruitment subject . Subjects meet study research assistant inform sign consent obtain . Participants assign study number base order recruitment . The research assistant participant determine treatment order . Each participant assign treatment order base randomization table ( See Table 1 ) . The research assistant also obtain demographic data information present hypoglycemia treatment practice , explain study protocol , provide Study Protocol instruction ( see Appendix E ) . The lab/meter comparison obtain prior data collection . The study protocol follow : - Hypoglycemia confirm blood glucose test . - If blood glucose le 4.0 mmol/L treat pre-packaged treatment order determine randomization . - The blood glucose re-tested 15 minute treatment . - If blood glucose still less 4.0 mmol/L , treat per study protocol re-tested 15 minute later . - If next meal snack 1 hour away , snack contain 15 g carbohydrate protein eaten . - Participants record blood glucose result treatment method Low Blood Glucose Treatment Log . If participant follow outline protocol , instructed treat per usual practice record data . This mean hypoglycemic event treat per protocol likely occur child parent comfort home . Assuming child teens experience 1 3 hypoglycemic event per week , anticipate data collection occur 5 15 week period . The research assistant call participant every two week monitor study progress . Once subject treat 15 hypoglycemic episode per study protocol complete Low Blood Glucose Treatment Log , return pre-addressed stamp envelope . There question end Low Blood Glucose Treatment Log ask preferred method hypoglycemia treatment follow completion study .</detailed_description>
