	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial determine feasibility Y-90 plaque applicator . The Y-90 plaque application design deliver high dos radiation tumor spine involve dura ( tough outer layer spinal cord ) . Tumors spine need high dose radiation kill cancer cell . The nearby spinal cord sensitive area safely tolerate high dos radiation . The Y-90 plaque applicator special technique use deliver radiation dose tumor cell avoid spinal cord .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-Operative Dural Brachytherapy With Yttrium-90 Plaque Applicators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The surgeon remove participant tumor outer layer spinal cord ( dura ) . The Y-90 applicator `` dummy '' applicator bring surgery table protect container . A `` dummy '' applicator size shape Y-90 plaque applicator contain radioactive plaque . The `` dummy '' applicator place participant dura make sure fit properly , remove . The work Y-90 applicator place dura 10-17 1/2 minute remove . - External beam irradiation type high-energy radiation use kill cancer cell shrink tumor . This radiation give participant prior study . - After treatment , participant ask return follow-up visit 6 week , 3 month , every 6 month thereafter 4 year , annually year 10 . At visit , follow : physical examination ; recent medical history ; MRI CT scan ( twice year ) ; chest x-ray chest CT ( twice year ) .</detailed_description>
