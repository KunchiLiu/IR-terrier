	<criteria>Histologically confirm renal cell carcinoma metastases component clear ( conventional ) cell histology amenable surgery . Evidence unidimensionally measurable disease Male female , 18 year age old . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Resolution acute toxic effect Adequate organ function . Renal cell carcinoma without clear ( conventional ) cell component . Prior systemic therapy metastatic disease kind RCC , Interferon Interleukin , chemotherapy , hormonal , investigational targeted therapy . Patients may receive prior adjuvant therapy Interferon and/or Interleukin recurrence occur &gt; 6 month adjuvant therapy completion . Major surgery radiation therapy &lt; 4 week start study treatment . Prior palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion ( ) permit , provide least one measurable lesion irradiate . NCI CTCAE grade 3 hemorrhage &lt; 4 week start study treatment . Diagnosis second malignancy within last 5 year , except adequately treat basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer . History known brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , evidence brain leptomeningeal disease screen CT MRI scan . Any follow within 12 month prior study drug administration : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , 6 month pulmonary embolism . Preexisting thyroid abnormality thyroid function maintain normal range medication . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias , atrial fibrillation , prolongation QTc interval &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female . Hypertension control medication ( &gt; 150/100 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy ) . Ongoing treatment therapeutic dos Coumadin ( low dose Coumadin 2 mg PO daily deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis allow ) . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness . Current treatment another clinical trial . Pregnancy breastfeed . Female patient must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception period therapy . All female patient reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) prior enrollment . Male patient must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception period therapy . The definition effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
