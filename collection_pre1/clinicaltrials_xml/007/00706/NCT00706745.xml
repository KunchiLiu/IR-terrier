	<brief_summary>Rationale : Cis-9 , trans-11 conjugate linoleic acid ( CLA ) protect atherosclerosis development several animal model . Studies transgenic mouse show mechanism might involve beneficial effect lipoprotein metabolism insulin sensitivity addition activation anti-inflammatory pathway . A limited amount human study show similar beneficial effect cis9 , trans11-CLA insulin sensitivity obese subject , yet cis9 , trans11-CLA improve lipoprotein profile healthy subject . The effect cis9 , trans11-CLA supplementation alternative early biomarkers atherosclerosis , like aortic pulse wave velocity , alternative biomarkers identify platelet proteomics , assess , may add valuable insight mechanism functional fatty acid human . Objective : To assess effect increase intake cis9 trans11-CLA development atherosclerosis , assess aortic pulse wave velocity alternative biomarkers . Study design : The study design double blind randomise placebo control parallel group trial . Study population : 400 men woman , 40 70 year age , body mass index 25 kg/m2 . Subjects previous symptomatic vascular disease diabetes mellitus subject blood pressure lower lipid lower medication exclude . Intervention : Subjects intervention arm receive daily 4 g CLA oil ( 2.6 g cis9 , trans11-CLA ) , 2 capsule take morning 2 evening . The subject control arm receive 4 identical placebo capsule . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study outcome difference treatment arm change aortic pulse wave velocity 6 month intervention .</brief_summary>

Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study outcome difference treatment arm change aortic pulse wave velocity 6 month intervention . Secondary outcome difference treatment group change serum lipid ( total , LDL- HDL cholesterol triglyceride ) change systolic diastolic blood pressure , well F2-isoprostanes platelet biomarkers haemostatic function ( proteomics ) . Blood sample store assessment plasma parameter glucose intolerance , inflammation endothelial function . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The assessment aortic pulse wave velocity non-invasive carry risk side effect . The assessment lipid blood pressure might sometimes carry discomfort see routine procedure . Completion questionnaire need do . The participant need come research center three time . Based finding several short-term long-term study use compound , excess serious adverse event find .</detailed_description>
