	<brief_summary>Background : - Melanoma antigen recognize T cell ( MART-1 ) gene present melanoma cell . - This study test experimental treatment use patient 's lymphocyte ( type white blood cell ) , specially select genetically modify gene call anti-MART-1 transduced cell ( F5 ) target destroy tumor . Some cell give infusion others give vaccine . - The anti-MART-1 F5 cell currently study patient combination chemotherapy IL-2 ( aldesleukin ) therapy . Objectives : -To determine anti-MART-1 F5 treatment improve immune system 's ability shrink tumor prevent melanoma recur . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old whose melanoma remove currently disease-free , risk recurrence . - Patients ocular mucosal melanoma . - Patients tissue type human leukocyte antigen ( HLA-A ) *0201 ) . Design : - Workup : Patients scan , x-ray , laboratory test , test need leukapheresis , procedure collect white cell modify laboratory later reinfuse patient . - Patients assign one four study group : - Group 1 receive anti-MART-1 F5 cell 30-minute infusion vein day 0 . - Group 2 receive anti-MART-1 F5 cell day 0 follow injection MART-1 vaccine , contain MART-1 oil-based liquid call Montanide ISA-51 VG . The vaccine repeat day 30 . - Group 3 receive anti-MART-1 F5 cell day 0 follow injection low-dose IL-2 5 day ( day 0-4 ) . - Group 4 receive anti-MART-1 F5 cell day 0 follow MART-1 vaccine low-dose IL-2 5 day . The vaccine repeat day 30 . - Recovery : Patients monitor closely give medicine prevent treat side effect therapy . - Leukapheresis : Patients undergo leukapheresis 1 3 month therapy collect cell examine effect treatment immune system . - Follow-up : Patients return National Institutes Health ( NIH ) 35 day complete treatment 3 month every 6 month thereafter evaluation physical examination , review side effect , laboratory test scan . They blood test 3 , 6 12 month treatment year . A biopsy may request treatment end examine effect treatment immune system . All patient return NIH physical examination year 5 year complete follow-up questionnaire another 10 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-MART-1 F5 Lymphocytes Treat High-Risk Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : We engineer human peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBLs ) express anti-MART-1 T-cell receptor ( TCR ) recognize HLA-A*0201 restrict epitope derive tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) clone DMF5 . We construct single retroviral vector encodes alpha beta chain mediate genetic transfer T cell receptor ( TCR ) high efficiency without need perform selection . In co-cultures HLA-A*0201 positive melanoma , anti-MART-1 F5 TCR transduce T cell secrete significant amount IFN- significant secretion observe control co-cultures cell line . The anti-MART-1 F5 TCR transduce PBL could efficiently kill HLA-A*0201 positive tumor . There little recognition normal fibroblast cell . This TCR 10 time reactive melanoma cell MART-1 F4 TCR mediate tumor regression two patient metastatic melanoma . Poxviruses encode melanoma antigen , similar ALVAC MART-1 vaccine show successfully immunize patient antigen . Objectives : Primary objective : To evaluate ability four different strategy enhance persistence anti-tumor T cell circulation 5-10 day , 31-35 day treatment ( define F5 cell cohorts 1 2 , aldesleukin cohort 3 4 ) potentially select one strategy study . With Amendment E , primary objective evaluate ability three different strategy enhance persistence anti-tumor T cell circulation 5-10 day 31-35 day treatment ( define F5 cell cohort 5 , aldesleukin cohort 6 , ALVAC MART-1 vaccine cohort 7 ) potentially select one strategy study . Eligibility : Patients HLA-A*0201 positive 18 year age old must : - primary melanoma lesion ulcerate great equal 2.0 mm , lesion great equal 4.0 mm thickness , great equal 1 positive lymph node , local recurrence , resect metastatic disease , within 6 month surgical resection . - must clinically disease free time protocol entry document radiologic study within 4 week patient entry . - may prior adjuvant treatment immunotherapy , include interferon , long 3 week elapse since prior systemic therapy . - normal value basic laboratory value . Patients may : - ocular mucosal melanoma ; - previously immunize MART-1 ; - concurrent major medical illness ; - form primary secondary immunodeficiency ; - severe hypersensitivity agent use study ; Design : Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 1 time 10^10 cell ) culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell growth . Transduction initiate exposure approximately 10^8 5 time 10^9 cell retroviral vector supernatant contain anti-MART-1 F5 TCR gene . These transduced cell ( call F5 cell ) expand test anti-tumor activity . F5 cell administer intravenously dose 1 time 10^9 7 time 10^10 cell . Patients randomize one follow four cohort : 1 . F5 cell day 0 alone 2 . F5 cell day 0 follow subcutaneous injection 1.0 mg MART-1:26-35 ( 27L ) peptide Montanide ISA-51 VG day 0 day 30 . 3 . F5 cell day 0 follow subcutaneous injection 125,000 IU/kg/day aldesleukin day 0-4 . 4 . F5 cell day 0 plus MART-1:26-35 ( 27L ) peptide Montanide ISA-51 VG day 0 day 30 , 125,000 IU/kg aldesleukin day 0-4 . Starting amendment E , four cohort close accrual patient randomize follow cohort : 5 . F5 cell day 0 follow subcutaneous injection ALVAC MART-1 vaccine . Second dose ALVAC MART-1 vaccine give day 14 . 6 . F5 cell day 0 follow subcutaneous injection ALVAC MART-1 vaccine subcutaneous injection 125,000 IU/kg/day aldesleukin day 0-4 . Second dose ALVAC MART-1 vaccine give day 14 . 7 . ALVAC MART-1 vaccine day 0 14 . Patients undergo complete evaluation physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis ( 3 month thereafter ) clinical laboratory evaluation day 35 , 3 month treatment every six month study criterion meet . Each cohort conduct use two-stage MiniMax design . This design try determine whether modality administration produce persistence transfer cell frequency great equal 5 percent circulate cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8 ) plus cell 35 percent patient oppose undesirably low ( 15 percent ) , 3 percent probability accept poor schedule 15 percent probability reject good schedule . Initially 22 patient enrolled cohort . If four immunologic response ( persistence ) note give cohort , accrual 39 patient would take place . The cohort high number patient exhibit persistence consider immunologically active consider worthy development . If arm few 11 39 patient persistence , consider worthy consideration . Starting amendment E , 10 patient enrol new cohort ( cohorts 5-7 ) . If three arm , 2 10 patient 5 % CD8+ circulating cell , cohort consider worthy consideration .</detailed_description>
