	<brief_summary>Background : COPD systemic illness ; morbidity mortality due disease increase , great impact patient ' life . Most COPD patient manage general practitioner ( GP ) . GPs base initial assessment patient ' disease severity mainly lung function inform patient adequate treatment . However , lung function correlate poorly COPD-specific health-related quality life exacerbation frequency . Preventive cardiology embrace risk index-guided treatment successfully . COPD disease severity indices well represent clinical manifestation COPD need use guide risk-stratified treatment . Objectives : ( 1 ) The development validation practical COPD disease severity index predict course health-related quality life time . ( 2 ) The validation ADO-Index ( Age , Dyspnea , Obstruction ) predict 3-year mortality COPD patient primary care . ( 3 ) Link evidence treatment effect COPD risk index guide COPD treatment selection . Methods : We process conduct two link prospective cohort study 413 COPD patient ( GOLD stag 2-4 ) GPs Switzerland Netherlands . We perform sound baseline assessment include detailed patient history , lung function , measurement exercise capacity blood sampling . During follow-up least five year , update patient ' profile register health status , exacerbation health-related quality life , 2 year , lung function measurement exercise capacity . For aim 1 , identify best combination variable predict course health-related quality life time use multivariable regression analysis . For aim 2 , assess discrimination calibration ADO index predict 3-year mortality . For aim 3 , estimate treatment effect individual patient profile use complex statistical model Markov model . Significance project : After study , different risk score available use primary care general practitioner estimate impact COPD patient . By link risk score evidence form treatment study , possible show individual patient COPD different treatment impact mortality , symptoms exacerbation . Thereby , patient physician make informed treatment decision balance benefit downside different treatment .</brief_summary>
