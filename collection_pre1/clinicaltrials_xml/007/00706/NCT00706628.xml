Progressive Disease ( PD ) define minimum three consecutive serum PSA measurement obtain least 7 day apart within previous 3 month start trial , document progressively increase value . Patients progression measurable disease ( RECIST ) progression bone disease must also fit criterion PSA progression . Patients must document progression ( define ) follow antiandrogen withdrawal 4 week duration flutamide 6 week bicalutamide nilutamide . For patient withdrawn antiandrogen therapy le 6 month prior inclusion trial one follow criterion also require : Following completion antiandrogen withdrawal period one PSA high last prewithdrawal PSA . Or Following completion antiandrogen withdrawal period PSA value decrease , still qualify 2 increase PSA document post withdrawal nadir . PSA &gt; 5ng/mL . Life expectancy least 12 week .
