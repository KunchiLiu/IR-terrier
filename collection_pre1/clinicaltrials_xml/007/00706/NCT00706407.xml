	<brief_summary>The purpose experiment confirm result previous test Urodynamix 's Uro-NIRS device . Together Urodynamix Laborie create device include standard Laborie medical equipment experimental Urodynamix device . Collectively integrated device consider investigational device , result study may use support submission US Food Drug Administration approval integrate device . This research do want test ability integrate Laborie Urodynamix device provide non-invasive method provide additional information assist diagnosis treatment plan patient suffer urinary problem . The current technology rely solely measurement internal pressure bladder , involve insertion catheter subject 's urethra .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uro-NIRS Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study fully integrate Uro-NIRS : UDS device ( Laborie Triton Laborie Dorado Urodynamix 's Non-Invasive Urodynamics device - Uro-NIRS ) , confirm result use fully integrate Uro-NIRS : UDS device compare stand-alone URO-NIRS device UDS device . The study evaluate male patient low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) female subject over-active bladder ( OAB ) . The Uro-NIRS unit use near infrared light 3 different wavelength measure change haemoglobin cytochrome detrusor muscle human bladder wall . This process similar use cerebral muscle oxygenation monitoring ( e.g. , pulse oximetry ) . Previous clinical feasibility study identify correlation change haemoglobin cytochrome pressure value obtain urodynamics procedure uroflow procedure . For study Uro-NIRS result specifically used urologist/nurse guide patient management treatment decision , rather use collect measurement patient . The Uro-NIRS sensor patch adhere skin surface bladder locate . The study conduct two principal investigator two clinical study sit collectively enrol minimum 50 subject , minimum 35 male subject maximum 15 female subject . The study enrolment objective equally enrol male subject three category : unequivocal , obstruct unobstructed . Female subject shall OAB .</detailed_description>
