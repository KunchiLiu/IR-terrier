	<criteria>Male patient age &gt; 18 year . Signed informed consent . Able comply protocol requirement . Patients histologically , cytologically biochemically document metastatic adenocarcinoma prostate , clinically refractory resistant hormone therapy , document progression follow least one hormonal therapy , must include orchidectomy gonadotropin release hormone agonist ( GnRHa ) . Patients Progressive Disease ( PD ) . PD define minimum three consecutive serum PSA measurement obtain least 7 day apart within previous 3 month start trial , document progressively increase PSA value . Patients progression measurable disease ( RECIST ) progression bone disease must also fit criterion PSA progression . Patients must document progression ( define ) follow antiandrogen withdrawal 4 week duration flutamide 6 week bicalutamide nilutamide . For patient withdrawn antiandrogen therapy le 6 month prior inclusion trial , one follow criterion also require : Following completion antiandrogen withdrawal period one PSA measurement high last prewithdrawal PSA . Or Following completion antiandrogen withdrawal period PSA value decrease , patient still qualify 2 increase PSA document post withdrawal nadir . PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml . A predicted life expectancy least 12 week . A maximum one prior treatment either chemotherapy nonhormonal treatment modality . ECOG performance status 01 . Stable analgesia requirement . INR Prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) &lt; 1.5 upper limit normal . Adequate bone marrow function define absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1.5 x 109l , Platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/l . Haemoglobin &gt; 9.0 mg/dl . Serum Albumin &gt; 2.0 g/l . Castrate testosterone level [ &lt; 20 ng/dl &lt; 0.69nM ( nM/L x 28.8 = ng/dl ) ] must maintain duration trial orchidectomy medical castration . Patients oral intravenous bisphosphonates allow enter trial long bisphosphonates minimum 3 month . Prior treatment one cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen . Known suspect hypersensitivity trial drug excipients . Persistence toxicity prior anticancer therapy deem clinically relevant . Aspartate amino transferase ( ast ) alanine amino transferase ( alt ) great 2.5 time upper limit normal , aspartate amino transferase ( ast ) alanine amino transferase ( alt ) great 5 time upper limit normal case know liver metastasis . Bilirubin great 1.5 mg/dl ( &gt; 26 micromol/l , Si unit equivalent ) . Serum creatinine great 2.0 g/l . Concomitant intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness social situation would limit compliance trial requirement consider relevant evaluation efficacy safety trial drug . Systemic corticosteroid take within past 28 day screen ( inhaled corticosteroid prescribe bronchospasm allow ) . Patients longterm stabledose steroid concurrent illness exclude . Treatment investigational drug within 28 day trial onset . History malignancy could affect compliance protocol interpretation result within 5years . Patients adequately treat basal squamous cell skin cancer generally eligible . Patient history clinical evidence CNS disease brain metastasis . Patients symptoms impend establish spinal cord compression . Radiotherapy within past four week prior treatment trial drug . Prior radioisotope therapy ( except radium223 permissible ) . Immunotherapy within past four week prior treatment trial drug . Patients unable comply protocol . Active alcohol drug abuse . Patients use adequate contraception .</criteria>
