	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether mipomersen safely effectively lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) patient Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia ( HeFH ) coronary artery disease ( CAD ) already stable dose lipid-lowering agent ( include maximally tolerate statin therapy ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study ISIS 301012 ( Mipomersen ) Add-on Familial Hypercholesterolemic Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) autosomal dominant genetic disorder lipoprotein metabolism characterize markedly elevated LDL-C , premature onset atherosclerosis development xanthomata . Patients heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia typically total plasma cholesterol 350 550 mg/dL disease onset third fourth decade . Mipomersen ( ISIS 301012 ) antisense drug reduces protein liver cell call apolipoprotein B ( apo-B ) . Apo-B plays role produce low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( `` bad '' cholesterol ) move liver one 's bloodstream . High LDL-C independent risk factor development coronary heart disease ( CHD ) diseases blood vessel . It show lower LDL-C reduces risk heart attack major adverse cardiovascular event . This study consist 26-week treatment period 24-week post-treatment follow-up period ( exception patient enrol open-label extension study [ Study 301012-CS6 ; NCT00694109 ] ) . The treatment period span time study treatment administer later primary efficacy time point ( PET ) 14 day beyond last day study drug administration . The post-treatment follow-up period begin day completion treatment period end day patient 's last contact date within study . Following treatment Week 28 evaluation , eligible patient tolerate study drug could elect enroll open-label extension study ( 301012-CS6 ) . Patients eligible elect enroll open-label extension study patient discontinue 26-week treatment period follow study additional 24 week administration last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
