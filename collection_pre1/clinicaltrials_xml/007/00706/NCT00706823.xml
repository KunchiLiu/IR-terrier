	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate new disposable supra-glottic airway device , i-gel airway ( Intersurgical Ltd. , Wokingham , England ) . We propose test ease insertion , position within airway , drain tube patency anatomic sealing property mechanical ventilation non-obese anesthetized patient undergo elective general surgery . The study device compare current standard industry , LMA Unique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During past decade , several pharyngeal airway introduce airway management , Laryngeal Mask Airway ( LMA ) , Cobra perilaryngeal airway , Esophageal Tracheal Combitube ( ETC ) , EasyTube , Laryngeal Tube6 , Streamlined Liner Pharyngeal Airway ( SLIPA ) . These airway device become popular ability maintain airway without perturb trachea use patient without muscle relaxation lightly anesthetize . The LMA Classic ( cLMA ) generally provide adequate airway , certain problem remain : 1 . In 8-33 % LMA placement , one attempt require . 2 . It sometimes difficult advance LMA without extend neck ( contraindicated patient ) . 3 . The device protect airway aspiration gastric content . 4 . It provide airtight seal around larynx ( usual pressure cause leakage gas 15-20 cm H20 ) . Consequently , device may function poorly positive-pressure ventilation . 5 . The esophagus include within rim LMA 10-15 % patient , directly expose esophagus positive airway pressure . This often result insufflation stomach postoperative discomfort . The LMA Unique ( uLMA ) disposable , inflatable supraglottic airway device base LMA Classic design use `` model '' industry . It list commonly accepted device routine rescue airway management listed American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) Difficult Airway Management Algorithm airway conduit tracheal intubation . The i-gel ( Intersurgical Ltd. , Wokingham , England ) cuffless , single-use supraglottic airway device design provide effective seal uLMA , thus eliminate problem 3-5 described addition gastric drain . Made gel-like thermoplastic elastomer , i-gel anatomically-designed mask allow quick , easy insertion accurately position laryngeal framework provide reliable perilaryngeal seal without need inflatable cuff . In preliminary study , peak airway pressure find 30 cm H2O sustain leak pressure 24 cm H2O versus average 18-21 cm H2O see cLMA . According 100 patient trial , i-gel easy insert , good seal property cuff inflates . This clinical study design compare i-gel uLMA , ease placement , ventilation mechanical ventilation , proper positioning , seal pressure , patency drain tube , finally , complication use . Fiberoptic observation device provide information relation epiglottis distal opening device .</detailed_description>
