	<brief_summary>The objective study determine whether systemic blood pressure body related development progression normal tension glaucoma eye . The study aim clarify whether subject episodes hypotension ( low blood pressure ) night increase risk sight loss development normal tension glaucoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New View Normal Tension Glaucoma : Autoregulation Systemic Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma eye disease lead damage optic nerve , visual field loss progress blindness . Traditionally , glaucoma treatment closely link intraocular pressure . In normal tension glaucoma , damage optic nerve occur without increase intraocular pressure . Normal tension glaucoma often occur elderly lead loss sight significant disability . Subjects progressive visual field loss often highly motivate group subject , ready take active part treatment condition . Investigating risk factor contribute development normal-tension glaucoma may shed light progression disease . Subjects normal tension glaucoma demographic clinical characteristic record eye examine baseline , 6-months 12 month . Subjects wear external blood pressure cuff 48 hour record blood pressure every 30 minute . This blood pressure record procedure perform baseline , 6 month , 12 month . At time interval , visual field also measure , per routine clinical care , treat ophthalmologist . The result visual field test record . The primary outcome study visual field abnormality relationship dip systemic blood pressure . Results publish used base future project may impact treatment understand risk factor normal tension glaucoma .</detailed_description>
