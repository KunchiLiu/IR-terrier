	<brief_summary>Eligible patient undergo open label initial safety feasibility study investigate use 6 g/day sodium oxybate mild AD . A total 5 visit include trial total subject participation duration 7-8 week . The screening phase include initial screen visit screen PSG night . After successful screening , subject complete baseline PSG night undergo third PSG night monitor initial safety compliance study drug dosage 4.5 g/day sodium oxybate . Thus subject undergo three consecutive night PSG sleep center . The patient maintain dosage 4.5 g/day duration 7 day lead Treatment Visit 1 . After successful assessment Treatment Visit 1 , dosage increase 6 g/day duration trial . At Treatment Visit 2 ( day 21 ) , dosage increase dosage 9 g/day , tolerate patient . The remain visit occur 6 week baseline , Treatment Visit 3 consist two consecutive night PSG . Participation complete visit . Phone follow-up make one week post completion visit ass wash-out symptom . Please refer Figure flow study design .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening Visit ( Day -14 -7 ) : To avoid confusion , study visit occur Clayton Sleep Institute . A spouse caregiver require attend visit . During screen visit potential patient provide informed consent , must sign patient caregiver , follow medical sleep history physical , completion Morse Fall Scale , CDR scale , Mini-Mental Status exam ( MMSE ) , well draw clinical lab , collection urine drug screen , completion 12-lead ECG . Mild AD patient must previous clinical diagnosis accord establish criterion . Review concomitant medication , stimulant usage , vital sign also record . In order ass sleep quality , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) administer . Participants meet study criterion ask continuously wear wrist actigraph ( Actiwatch Score ; Mini Mitter Co. , Inc , Sunriver , OR ) screen visit baseline visit . Each subject instruct press event button bedtime upon awaken morning . Data collection 60 second epoch . A handwritten sleep caregiver diary maintain duration study period document daily bedtime , wake time , stimulant usage well provide daily estimate sleep latency , total sleep time , sleep quality , well dose compliance , adverse event , behavior . Baseline Visit ( Day 0-2 ) : The baseline visit occur 1-2 week screen visit allow medication washout period need . Participants ask arrive sleep center 7:30 PM three night . During even three test night , concomitant medication stimulant usage adverse event review , well gait stability assessment vital sign perform . Night one consist screen PSG assess potential sleep disorder . Patients meet exclusion criterion sleep disorder night one exclude study . Participants allow leave morning screening PSG return evening . Night two consist full PSG , night serve baseline data . Two hour completion PSG , patient complete battery test measure daytime functioning , memory function , neurobehavioral testing . Measures include Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) , Clayton Daytime Functioning Scale ( CDFS ) , PSQI , PVT , National Adult Reading Test- Revised ( NART-R ) , Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test ( RAVLT ) , Kendrick Object Learning Task ( KOLT ) , Cambridge Cognitive Examination ( CAMCOG ) . Following battery measurement , study physician complete Clinician 's Interview-Based Impression Severity ( CIBIS ) visit mild AD patient complete Caregiver Distress Scale ( NPI-CDS ) . Finally , Instrumental Activities Daily Living ( IADL ) questionnaire give complete . Night three night PSG specifically monitor assess compliance side effect first study drug dosage . A dosage 4.5 g/day sodium oxybate use study night first week treatment . Prior PSG subject caregiver give instruction usage study drug caregiver assist measure dose study drug . Following completion PSG , enough study drug one week dispense . The actigraph sleep/caregiver diary collect , new diary give complete next visit . Phone follow-up make 3 day later assess study drug compliance adverse event . Treatment Visit 1 ( Day 7 ) : Approximately one week completion baseline visit , patient caregiver return sleep center daytime visit ass study drug compliance , adverse event , caregiver report via diary CDS . The study physician , caregiver input , complete Caregiver Clinical Global Assessment Change ( CCGIC ) ass change disease severity baseline . Concomitant medication stimulant usage , gait stability , vital sign assess . The battery daytime functioning , sleep quality , memory neurobehavioral , quality life measure administer . Finally , remain study drug collect new study drug dispense instruction dose 6 g/day sodium oxybate provide patient caregiver . A new sleep/caregiver diary provide actigraph dispense worn continuously Treatment Visit 2 . Phone follow-up make one week later assess study drug compliance adverse event . Treatment Visit 2 ( Day 21 ) : Approximately three week completion baseline visit , patient caregiver return sleep center daytime visit . All procedure assessment perform similar Treatment Visit 1 , addition clinical lab collect 12-lead ECG perform . Once , remain study drug collect new study drug dispense instruction dose 9 g/day sodium oxybate provide patient caregiver , pending tolerability patient . If patient unable tolerate increase dosage opinion investigator question tolerability , dosage remain 6 g/day . The first phone follow-up make 3 day post-visit assess tolerability dosage increase . Once tolerability question , dosage may titrate back 6 g/day . A new sleep/caregiver diary provide . Phone follow-up make week ass study drug compliance adverse event . Finally , actigraph dispense around day 30 ( either mail patient pick sleep center ) instruction patient continuously wear actigraph final visit press event button bedtime waketime . Treatment Visit 3 ( Day 42 ) : Approximately six week completion baseline visit , patient caregiver return sleep center Treatment Visit 3 . The patient caregiver arrive sleep center 7:30 PM night PSG test perform study visit . Night one serve adaptation night night two data collection . All procedure assessment perform similar Treatment Visit 2 , battery assessment follow completion PSG night two . All study medication , sleep/caregiver diary , actigraph collect . An end study physical perform conjunction assessment . Active participation study conclude visit . A final follow-up phone call make one week post final study visit ass final adverse event , especially study drug withdrawn .</detailed_description>
