The patient schedule receive anticancer specific treatment , include radiotherapy , immunotherapy , chemotherapy immunomodulating agent . The patient require concomitant treatment systemic corticosteroid , immunosuppressive agent . The patient receive cancer immunotherapeutic contain MAGEA3 antigen cancer immunotherapeutic his/her metastatic disease . The patient receive investigational nonregistered drug vaccine study medication within 30 day precede first ASCI injection plan ( ) receive drug study period . The patient ( ) previous concomitant malignancy site , except effectively treat malignancy consider investigator highly likely cure .
