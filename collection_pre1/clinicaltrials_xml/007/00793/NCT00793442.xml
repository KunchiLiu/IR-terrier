	<detailed_description>The endothelial response emerge critical element sepsis pathophysiology . Preclinical data small human study suggest endothelial cell responsible increase leukocyte adhesion , inflammation , activation coagulation , respond increase level endothelial cell mediator Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor ( VEGF ) . Furthermore , endothelium play active role microcirculatory homeostasis preservation microvascular flow . We propose study endothelium perform comprehensive endothelial cell `` read-out '' measurement circulating level endothelial cell biomarkers well direct visualization microcirculatory flow in-vivo videomicroscopy . Accordingly , broad , long-term objective project study role endothelium sepsis large , heterogeneous group patient . To accomplish , investigate two specific aim : 1 ) study biomarkers endothelial cell activation sepsis ; , 2 ) study microcirculatory flow sepsis . The overall hypothesis project severe sepsis associate endothelial dysfunction ; endothelial dysfunction , turn , predictive subsequent organ failure death ; early effective protocol-directed resuscitation attenuate endothelial dysfunction lead improved survival . To test hypothesis , utilize patient , ancillary measurement ( notably in-vivo assessment microcirculatory flow ) , additional sample assay ProCESS clinical trial . ProCESS large , multicenter , randomize , control clinical trial test efficacy mechanism behind protocolized goal-directed resuscitation . To conduct line investigation direct endothelium microcirculation address original trial , select 8 ProCESS study sit participation ancillary study . We directly visualize quantify presence disturbance sublingual microcirculatory flow utilize novel bedside technique orthogonal polarization microscopy . Furthermore , develop multi-marker panel ass degree endothelial cell dysfunction subsequent mortality risk . We also capitalize randomly assign intervention ProCESS clinical trial observe difference endothelial response across alternative resuscitation strategy . Improved understanding mechanism may lead strategy predict outcome , select patient tailor ( endothelium-directed ) therapy , follow treatment response , develop novel therapy endothelial dysfunction sepsis .</detailed_description>
