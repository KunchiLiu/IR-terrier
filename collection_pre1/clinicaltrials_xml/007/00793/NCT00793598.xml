Renal transplant patient : least 28 day post transplant stable condition hemoglobin &gt; 10g/100mL ( Cohort 3A ) ≥8g/100mL ( Cohorts 4A , 4B 4C ) evidence graft rejection ( i.e. , serum creatinine increase ( +/ 30 % ) , creatinine clearance decrease ) stable immunosuppressant ( IS ) regimen least 14 day prior dose . Stable immunosuppression allow change standard care management immunosuppression regimen ( e.g. , steroid taper dose adjustment maintain trough level therapeutic range ) . These also include adjustment dose due know side effect IS ( e.g. , GI symptoms MMF ) . either urine level BKV DNA ≥ 104 copies/mL without viremia plasma level BKV DNA &lt; 104 copies/mL ( without viruria ) . Plasma level BKV DNA 104 105 copies/mL consider case case basis consultation medical monitor ( Cohorts 4A , 4B 4C ) .

Patients HIV positive ( result must obtain within one year prior dose ) ; patient active HCV HBV infection evidence plasma level HCV RNA HBV DNA , respectively . Renal transplant patient evidence biopsy proven acute rejection 3 week prior enrollment . This exclusion criterion apply patient biopsy perform within three week prior enrollment . Stem cell transplant patient ( Cohort 3A ) : 1. cystitis ≥ Grade 3 ( NCI , CTCAE v3.0 ) 2.
