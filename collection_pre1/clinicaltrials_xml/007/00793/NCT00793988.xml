	<detailed_description>Purpose : To carry prospective randomise control clinical trial compare efficacy vibration reduce pain local anaesthetic injection upper eyelid . Hypothesis : Vibration adjacent soft tissue reduces pain anaesthetic injection upper eyelid surgery . Justification : In many surgical procedure perform local anaesthetic , frighten painful aspect procedure patient anaesthetic injection , various technique advocate address . Explaining patient beforehand expect , talk injection hand-holding helpful relax distract patient ; however , alone unlikely sufficient relieve pain injection case . Simple measure reduce pain anaesthetic injection widely practise include administer injection slowly use fine-bore needle ( 30 Gauge ) . Other technique show effective include warm buffer local anaesthetic [ 1-6 ] . The use 0.9 % bacteriostatic saline solution conjunction lidocaine demonstrate significantly reduce patient ' perceive pain injection operative procedure eyelid surgery [ 7 ] . Cooling skin immediately prior treatment show reduce pain dermatological laser procedure [ 8-10 ] although might difficult perform around eye risk injure cornea . Similarly , topical anaesthetic agent , EMLA ( eutectic mixture local anaesthetic ) cream , apply skin one hour prior injection commonly employ use limbs infant child safe use around eye since inadvertent ocular application cause corneal de-epithelisation [ 11 ] . Sedative agent , midazolam may useful anxious patient , require input anaesthetist often difficult finely control level sedation ; usually preferable patient sedate eyelid surgery patient cooperation require intra-operatively assess height eyelid , example ptosis surgery . Vibration , pinch application pressure long recognise method reduce concurrent pain . In 1965 Melzack Wall publish gate control theory pain asserted stimulation vibration touch receptor skin cause stimulation inhibitory interneurons spinal cord turn inhibit transmission pain signal brain . [ 12 ] Other hypothesis explain mechanism action hyper-stimulatory anaesthesia relate acupuncture-type effect , distraction , self-hypnosis suggestion credulous patient , consensus view gate theory least part relevant explanation . [ 13 , 14 ] There much anecdotal evidence use technique reduce pain anaesthetic injection , mostly dentistry dermatology [ 14-17 ] dearth evidence randomise controlled trial ; recent randomise clinical study paediatric dental patient find counterstimulation , use thumb vibrate soft tissue adjacent injection site , conjunction distraction exercise ( lift alternate leg turn ) effectively reduce pain anaesthetic injection . [ 18 ] There report vibration anaesthesia ophthalmic setting . Objectives : The aim study carry randomise control study investigate effect vibration-assisted anaesthesia reduce pain local anaesthetic injection upper eyelid surgery . A pilot study carry prior proposal investigate feasibility potential benefit trial promising result . Prior pilot study various different vibrate device ( include tune forks two different frequency , electric toothbrush ( soft rubber cap instead brush head ) several model handheld massager ) trialled investigator colleague find optimal device . Once preferred instrument ( handheld massager ) select test various different site ( include midbrow , mid forehead , supraorbital notch , low eyelid , thumbnail palm ) verbally-consenting patient undergoing bilateral eyelid surgery order find optimal site . The patient receive massager injection one side ( first eye , second eye ) ask verbally rate pain score two side . The consensus opinion great effect produce vibration middle forehead . The pilot study conduct 15 verbally consent patient undergoing bilateral upper eyelid surgery ; anaesthetic injection one side receive vibration side receive vibration . Patients ask rate pain injection verbally scale 0 10 . 12 15 patient find anaesthetic injection side vibration less painful side without . Research Methods : The study prospective , interventional , randomise , control clinical trial . All patient fit inclusion criterion offer participation trial day surgery book . They give information leaflet trial , explain aim study without describe effect vibrate device placebo order reduce risk bias perception . They advise non-participation affect care anyway . The intervention risk patient affect surgical procedure way . Any question patient address beforehand require sign consent form prior inclusion trial . They advise beforehand require verbally rate pain score scale 0 10 immediately side anaesthetise , 0 pain 10 bad imaginable pain . All participant include study undergo bilateral surgery therefore act control : vibrate device apply whilst anaesthetic inject one side ; placebo applied side . The placebo consist switched-off vibrate device apply test site second identical switched-on vibrating device hold close ( touch ) first , therefore make sound . Care take ensure device participant ' view . The test placebo randomly assign either first second eyelid ; right eyelid inject first patient , routine practice . Computer-generated sequential binary randomisation use . Allocation conceal surgeon immediately prior anaesthetic injection . All anaesthetic injection consist xylocaine 1 % 1:100,000 adrenaline administer short 30 Gauge needle constant slow speed multiple ( 6-7 ) sit along upper lid single oculoplastic consultant . The vibration device placebo operate single oculoplastics fellow . The vibrate device / placebo place middle forehead 1 cm mid-brow point 1 second anaesthetic injection commence . It lift skin every time injection needle exit skin replace point 1 second needle reenters skin new injection site . Patients ' verbal pain score elicit document immediately oculoplastic fellow . Statistical analysis : From pilot study involve ask 15 patient undergoing upper eyelid surgery rate pain experience injection local anaesthetic scale 0 10 , find pain score sufficiently Normal estimation sample size base Normal distribution . A comparison pain score side receive vibration side receive placebo make use paired t-test . Planned sample size On scale 0 10 difference pain score 1.5 may consider clinically significant . The power calculation pair t-test 90 % power p=0.05 demonstrate sample size 80 patient sufficient detect significant difference . The result submit publication peer-reviewed ophthalmological journal presentation international ophthalmological meeting .</detailed_description>
