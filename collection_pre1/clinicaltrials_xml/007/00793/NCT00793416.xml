	<detailed_description>This study aim correlate finding ShuntCheck MRI Radionuclide patency study . Patients enrol Hydrocephalus IIH , present symptom shunt obstruction need undergo shunt patency test MRI along standard care radionuclide study . The ShuntCheck study conduct clinic , doctor 's office emergency room treat physician train health care professional . Also , patient find shunt obstruction diagnose Radionuclide study undergo shunt revision finding study correlate operative finding . Post Shunt replacement patient also receive adjustable valve evaluate shunt Check , adjustment valve detect change flow detect shunt check . This exploratory study determine non-invasive device assist detection presence flow patient . Approximately 20 subject enrol single site proof concept , physician sponsor study . An approved , commercial device available site prior start study .</detailed_description>
