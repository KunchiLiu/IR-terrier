	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance Substrate Metabolism After Acute Erythropoietin ( EPO ) Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently EPO receptor find human muscle tissue , still know physiological role receptor . It previously show Growth Hormone mediate insulin resistance . The GH receptor EPO receptor belong family cytokine receptor , thereby share many signal pathway . In study want investigate similar effect insulin resistance and/or substrate metabolism acute administration EPO human muscle tissue . Different signal pathway investigate p√• western blotting , insulin sensitivity measure hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp , substrate metabolism measure forearm model .</detailed_description>
