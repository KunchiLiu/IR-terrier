	<brief_title>Single Intravenous Administration TB-402 Prophylaxis Venous Thromboembolic Events ( VTE ) After Total Knee Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently available anticoagulant therapy prevention VTE include low molecular weight heparin , pentasaccharides vitamin K antagonist , inherent limitation ( 1-3 ) . Improved anticoagulant agent therefore require ( 4 ) . A novel antithrombotic agent require demonstration efficacy safety relevant population . Phase II study frequently perform patient undergoing total hip replacement and/or total knee replacement high well documented incidence deep vein thrombosis absence adequate thromboprophylaxis ( 5-7 ) . In study , assess safety efficacy TB-402 , novel antithrombotic agent partially inhibit factor VIII , prevention VTE patient undergo total knee replacement surgery .</detailed_description>
