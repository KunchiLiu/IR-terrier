	<brief_title>Reduced Intensity Stem Cell Transplantation Children With Relapsed Neuroblastoma After Autologous Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis high-risk neuroblastoma ( NB ) conventional chemoradiotherapy poor . Therefore , strategy use high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( HDCT/auto-SCT ) explore improve prognosis patient high-risk NB . The result randomize trial compare HDCT/auto-SCT chemotherapy alone show good event-free survival ( EFS ) auto-SCT arm continuous chemotherapy arm . However , overall EFS still unsatisfactory . In context , investigator examine efficacy double triple tandem auto-SCT improve outcome high-risk NB patient . George et al . carry single arm trial tandem auto-SCT consolidation therapy , report improved long-term survival ( 5-year progression-free survival 47 % ) acceptable toxicity . Kletzel et al . also conduct single arm trial triple tandem auto-SCT report improved survival ( 3-year EFS 57 % ) . Investigators present study also carry tandem auto-SCT consolidation therapy , report improved long-term survival ( 5-year progression-free survival 62 % ) acceptable toxicity . However , unfortunately , tumor relapse many patient even tandem auto-SCT . The major cause treatment failure follow auto-SCT remain relapse underlying disease . Additional chemotherapy relapse patient ineffective , therefore , new treatment strategy warrant . In context , allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo-SCT ) try salvage treatment patient NB fail prior auto-SCT . Allo-SCT would theoretically preferable term relapse-free survival antitumor effect due graft versus tumor ( GVT ) effect absent auto-SCT . The graft versus leukemia ( GVL ) effect represent widely accept major component allo-SCT , emerge evidence also GVT effect solid tumor . GVT effect also demonstrate patient advance NB receive HLA haplo-identical allo-SCT . Generally , allo-SCT carry low risk relapse , However , much high early treatment-related mortality ( TRM ) compare auto-SCT . TRM rate allo-SCT especially high patient fail prior auto-SCT . The 1-year TRM rate follow conventional ( ie myeloablative ) allo-SCT adult recipient prior auto-SCT report high 50-85 % . In child , transplantation-related toxicity also one major obstacle conventional allo-SCT already heavily treat prior allo-SCT . Therefore , salvage strategy show limited success majority child relapse NB fail prior single tandem auto-SCT , although allo-SCT supposed curative treatment patient . Only small proportion patient opportunity successfully undergo treatment . In recent year , several group investigator develop non-myeloablative reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC ) regimen , lead engraftment donor lymphoid hematopoietic stem cell without extra-hematopoietic toxicity traditional myeloablative transplantation conserve GVL GVT effect transplantation . This reduced toxicity may make RIC regimen especially suitable patient high-risk TRM , particular recipient second third transplantation .</detailed_description>
