	<brief_summary>The study vaccine proceed two stage method Simon ( 102 ) . In first stage , 15 patient accrue treat . If two few objective immunologic response occur , study terminate . If 3 response observe , study proceed second stage , accrue additional 22 patient . If second stage complete total 9 immunologic response observe among 37 patient treat , treatment response rate vaccine consider high enough warrant study . Conversely , evaluation vaccine conclude first stage , 8 few total immunologic response occur complete second stage , vaccine consider study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunization Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This uncontrolled , non-randomized trial evaluate safety , immunogenicity feasibility new vaccine , consist semi-allogeneic fibroblast transfected autologous tumor-derived DNA . Briefly , plan use two-stage trial design initially enroll 15 patient non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) period 2 year . The patient undergo surgery portion primary tumor specimen necessary pathologic diagnosis obtain serve source tumor DNA . Each DNA-based vaccine contain 1 x 10e7 DNA-transfected human allogeneic fibroblast . The vaccine lethally irradiate used immunization . It administer intradermally Outpatient Clinic . Patients delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) responses tested eligibility criterion . Immunologic response vaccine evaluate . If evidence toxicity , &gt; 3 15 initial patient show immunologic response , second stage study open accrual 22 patient . All patient monitor IFN-g secretion ELISPOT assay prior vaccination frequency T-cells responsive autologous tumor ( available ) and/or vaccine . The patient also evaluate vaccination capability T cell respond activate signal deliver via T cell receptor ( TcR ) .</detailed_description>
