	<brief_summary>In many case , exist lock bolt screw intramedullary nail provide sufficient stability . Due play screw nail , reduction lose instability result malunions , nonunions , pseudoarthrosis . Consequently , secondary angular fracture dislocation ( define difference angle 10° post-operative follow-up x-ray ) observe approximately 30 % patient conventional intramedullary nailing proximal third tibial fracture approximately 0-2 % patient distal third tibial fracture . Therefore , Angular Stable Locking System Intramedullary Nails ( ASLS ) develop reduce risk secondary loss reduction provide axial angular stability . ASLS provide angular stable fixation nail screw resorbable sleeve use dowel nail lock hole . The present study evaluate handle ASLS surgeon 's compliance well complication occur baseline follow-up period patient proximal distal tibial , femoral humeral fracture treat intramedullary nail . Furthermore , relationship occur complication ASLS assess .</brief_summary>
