	<brief_summary>Despite formal recommendation , evidence efficacy aspirin individual diabetes scant controversial . While efficacy aspirin versus placebo patient diabetes currently investigation big randomize controlled trial , putative additive effect aspirin statins population remain investigated . Moreover data examine pathophysiologic mean aspirin without statin affect thrombosis diabetic patient . The aim trial evaluate efficacy low-dose aspirin ( 100 mg/daily ) , statins , neither reduction thrombin generation . These preventive strategy evaluate top strategy aim optimize care diabetic patient term metabolic control control cardiovascular risk factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspirin Statins Or Both For The Reduction Of Thrombin Generation In Diabetic People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite high cardiovascular risk profile , evidence efficacy aspirin individual diabetes scant . The meta-analysis efficacy antiplatelet therapy involve total 5,000 diabetic subject indicate non significant reduction risk major cardiovascular event 7 % , compare reduction 25 % documented secondary prevention study . Diabetes could represent special case aspirin resistance , although specific study , knowledge , fully explore hypothesis . The poor platelet responsiveness aspirin recently propose possible explanation failure antiplatelet therapy prevent cardiovascular event . The reduction aspirin activity patient indicated failure adequately suppress thromboxane-A2 synthesis , document presence high level urinary metabolite . The substantial lack clear evidence reflect low use drug clinical practice ; fact , 10 % diabetic patient treat aspirin prevention cardiovascular event . On hand , statin provide similar efficacy prevention major cardiovascular event population without diabetes . It recently show platelet response aspirin linearly reduce increase cholesterol plasma level . The presence dyslipidemia , particularly common among diabetic patient , could thus least partially responsible low efficacy aspirin population . The concomitant use statin could thus restore normal platelet sensitivity aspirin reduce cholesterol level One additional reason hypothesize positive effect statins improve platelet response aspirin relate anti-inflammatory property While efficacy aspirin versus placebo patient diabetes currently investigation , additive effect aspirin statins population remain investigated . This aspect particular interest light exist debate regard need multiple intervention reduce total cardiovascular risk . Given premise , important evaluate effectiveness aspirin use primary prevention cardiovascular event association statins therapy include strategy global risk control . The RATIONAL Study evaluate whether combine use aspirin ( 100 mg ) statins ( Atorvastatin 40 mg daily ) superior use single agent reduction thrombin generation patient diabetes without previous cardiovascular event .</detailed_description>
