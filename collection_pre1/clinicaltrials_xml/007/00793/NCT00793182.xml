	<brief_title>Effects Contrast Media Subjects With Stable Reduced Renal Function Undergoing Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) acute decline renal function administration iodinate contrast agent . CIN commonly define increase post contrast serum creatinine ( SCr ) great equal 25 % absolute increase great equal 0.5 mg/dL pre contrast baseline value . Study evaluate compare effect two ( 2 ) contrast medium product renal function subject stable reduced renal function undergo contrast-enhanced computed tomography .</detailed_description>
