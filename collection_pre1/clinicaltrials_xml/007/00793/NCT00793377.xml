	<brief_summary>The primary objective trial compare rate pathologically complete remission achieve use preoperative dose-intensified 8 week therapy consist adriamycin docetaxel preoperative sequential 24 week regimen consist adriamycin/cyclophosphamide follow docetaxel , patient operable carcinoma breast . Secondary aim ass disease-free overall survival , rate complete partial response palpation image method , rate breast-conserving operation , toxicity two chemotherapy regimen . Women meet follow criterion eligible study : operable breast cancer ( T2-3 N0-2 M0 ) , diagnosis histologically confirm biopsy , measurable disease mammography sonography breast MRI ( appropriate method choose investigator ) . After patient give write informed consent , randomly assign study treatment . Patients group I receive four cycle combination chemotherapy consist adriamycin 50 mg/m2 ( 15 min i.v . infusion ) docetaxel 75 mg/m2 ( 1 h i.v . infusion ) repeat every 14 day , follow surgery 9-10 week start therapy . Patients group II receive four cycle adriamycin 60 mg/m2 ( 15 min i.v . ) cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 ( 1 h i.v . ) every three week , follow four cycle docetaxel 100 mg/m2 ( 1 h i.v . ) every three week . Surgery perform week 25 26 . Patients group additionally receive oral dos tamoxifen 20 mg daily 5 year , start first day chemotherapy . Surgery consist removal remain tumor ( breast-conserving resection mastectomy ) axillary dissection ( Sentinel node biopsy allow patient involved randomize trial . Radiotherapy applicated accord standard proceeding participate center . A second randomization additional versus additional postoperative chemotherapy recommend ypN+ disease . Patients disease progression preoperative therapy , chemotherapy stop surgery perform immediately .</brief_summary>
