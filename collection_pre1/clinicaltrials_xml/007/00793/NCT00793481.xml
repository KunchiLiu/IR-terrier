	<brief_summary>Metabolic Syndrome highly prevalent condition comprise several major cluster factor increase risk develop cardiovascular disease . Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy non-invasively measure show change microvasculature human . Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy measure optical absorption scatter property near-infrared light tissue muscle order quantify absolute concentration oxygenate deoxygenated hemoglobin , water , lipid . It provide quantitative functional information microvasculature relate tissue perfusion , metabolic change , indicator tissue damage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vascular Reactivity Metabolic Syndrome Diabetic Patients Using Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy monitor change microvasculature patient Metabolic Syndrome diabetic mellitus , patient Diabetic Peripheral Autonomic Neuropathy , versus non-diseased predisposed subject evaluate change oxygen metabolism . The Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy measure change concentration oxygen saturation hemoglobin microvasculature stress , example , exercise response change breathe habit . The sensitivity Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy tissue hemodynamics provide impressive arena useful clinical applications..</detailed_description>
