	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery treatment morbid obesity associate long-term weight-loss decrease overall mortality . Long-term result report laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure long-term result laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy yet unavailable . As sleeve gastrectomy rapid less traumatic procedure good short-term result weight loss resolution comorbidities , investigator initiate prospective randomize two-center study compare laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG ) laparoscopic gastric bypass ( LGB ) treatment morbid obesity . Study hypothesis : As sleeve gastrectomy less traumatic , easy faster perform compare gastric bypass , LSG could become procedure choice treat morbid obesity long-term result weight loss resolution comorbidities comparable laparoscopic gastric bypass .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In addition compare outcome sleeve gastrectomy gastric bypass , study project include PET trial conduct Turku . The objective PET study measure effect obesity food-stimuli mediate brain activation response hormone affect feed energy balance . In second part variable study bariatric surgery : either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy Roux-en-Y gastric bypass . In addition effect weight loss due bariatric surgery glucose uptake free fatty acid metabolism measure . The objective also study whether less invasive sleeve gastrectomy beneficial term weight loss co-morbid disease invasive Roux-en-Y gastric bypass compare risk factor two surgical procedure . Regional glucose uptake free fatty acid uptake myocardium , skeletal muscle , subcutaneous fat , visceral fat , pancreas , liver brain study PET baseline bariatric surgery post-operatively 3rd month . Changes body fat distribution , ectopic fat fat content key organ investigate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . Brain reward system response food stimulus assess use functional MRI ( fMRI ) white grey matter volume use diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . The study consist 80 morbidly obese adult , BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 additional risk factor BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 . From subject , 40 study positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . In addition functional MRI ( fMRI ) perform 40 subject . For fMRI , control group recruit consist 20 lean healthy subject . Subjects physically examine anthropometric data measure along blood sampling .</detailed_description>
