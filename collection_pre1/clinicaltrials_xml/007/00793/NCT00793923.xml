	<brief_summary>The primary objective propose research study evaluate safety intravitreal ranibizumab combination intravitreal dexamethasone comparison intravitreal ranibizumab alone treatment wet ARMD . The addition broad spectrum anti-inflammatory activity dexamethasone may augment anti-VEGF activity ranibizumab amelioration inflammation exist microenvironment choroidal neovascularization . While anti-VEGF agent proven efficacious treatment exudative ARMD , narrow target window activity may limit overall durability action .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Comparing Ranibizumab Plus Dexamethasone Combination Therapy Versus Ranibizumab Monotherapy Wet AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , single mask comparative trial use either combination therapy ( group 1 ) : day combination therapy 0.05cc intravitreal dexamethasone injection ( 10mg/ml vial ) single 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab injection four consecutive month compare monotherapy ( group 2 ) : one intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab also give four consecutive month . These treatment follow PRN treatment base clinical exam , angiographic study , OCT evidence residual subretinal fluid , CME , subretinal hemorrhage , pigment epithelial detachment . Fluorescein angiography fundus photography perform baseline 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month follow-up visit . Only OCT test perform follow-up visit . Both group re-evaluated safety 12 24 month .</detailed_description>
