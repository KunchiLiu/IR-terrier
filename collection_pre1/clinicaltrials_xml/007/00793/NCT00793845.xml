	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy toxicity tandem HDCT/ASCR child high-risk neuroblastoma . In present study , single arm trial tandem HDCT/ASCR carry . In present study , investigator investigate whether tandem HDCT/ASCR might improve survival patient high-risk neuroblastoma acceptable toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tandem High-dose Chemotherapy Autologous Stem Cell Rescue Patients With High-risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis high-risk neuroblastoma conventional chemoradiotherapy generally poor . Therefore , strategy use high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell rescue ( HDCT/ASCR ) explore improve prognosis patient high-risk neuroblastoma . This strategy base hypothesis dose escalation might improve survival child high-risk neuroblastoma . The result randomize trial compare HDCT/ASCR chemotherapy alone show good event-free survival ( EFS ) HDCT/ASCR arm continuous chemotherapy arm . However , overall EFS unsatisfactory . In context , investigator examine efficacy double triple tandem HDCT/ASCR improve outcome high-risk neuroblastoma patient . George et al . carry single arm trial tandem transplantation consolidation therapy , report improved long-term survival ( 5-year progression-free survival 47 % ) acceptable toxicity . Kletzel et al . also conduct single arm trial triple tandem transplantation report improved survival ( 3-year EFS 57 % ) . They demonstrate dose escalation use sequential HDCT/ASCR might result improvement survival patient high-risk neuroblastoma . Investigators present study also carry tandem transplantation consolidation therapy , report improved long-term survival ( 5-year progression-free survival 62 % ) acceptable toxicity . However , throughout previous study , multiple modification make treatment plan , result significant variability time patient . This variability may create doubt whether tandem HDCT/ASCR result improved outcome . In addition , toxic death rate relatively high ( 15.4 % ) , although final survival rate high ( best survival rate ever report ) . Therefore , prospective study need evaluate efficacy toxicity tandem HDCT/ASCR .</detailed_description>
