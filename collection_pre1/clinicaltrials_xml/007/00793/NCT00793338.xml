	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether sildenafil help treat heart failure . Some patient heart failure high blood pressure lung ( refer `` pulmonary hypertension '' ) . Sildenafil medication use treat high blood pressure lung may reduce symptom heart failure . Studies look short-term benefit sildenafil patient congestive heart failure , study look longer-term benefit 12 week therapy sildenafil .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Sildenafil Treatment Moderate Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine effect acute long-term treatment sildenafil clinical status patient moderate HF . Secondary Objectives : To determine effect acute long-term treatment sildenafil cardiopulmonary exercise performance , effect acute long-term treatment sildenafil neurohormonal activation , effect acute long-term treatment sildenafil hemodynamics , effect long-term treatment sildenafil quality life . Background : Secondary pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) frequent manifestation heart failure result impaired vascular reactivity permeability contribute symptom HF . Levels endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , potent vasoconstrictor , increase patient HF . At time , pulmonary artery nitric oxide ( NO ) production decrease . NO increases concentration second messenger cyclic-GMP , ultimately leading vasodilation . This imbalance NO-dependent vasodilation ET-1 induce vasoconstriction likely contribute development secondary pulmonary hypertension . cGMP metabolized type 5 isoform phosphodiesterase ( PDE5 ) enzyme highly express lung . Sildenafil , selective PDE5 inhibitor , use extensively treatment erectile dysfunction recently approve use treatment PH . Recent study short-term administration sildenafil HF patient secondary PH demonstrate reduction pulmonary arterial pressure , pulmonary vascular resistance , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , systemic vascular resistance increase cardiac index exercise performance . However , remain see sildenafil safe effective long-term treatment heart failure . Methods : This open-label , pilot study design evaluate safety efficacy sildenafil treatment moderate heart failure . The primary endpoint change 6-minute walk test distance . Secondary endpoint change peak oxygen consumption ( measure cardiopulmonary exercise test ) , neurohormone ( b-type natriuretic peptide , catecholamine , ET-1 ) , quality life score . Additionally , attempt analyze responsiveness sildenafil basis PDE5 polymorphism . Study procedure perform UNM General Clinical Research Center UNM Congestive Heart Failure Clinic . Patients hospitalize 3 day analyze safety efficacy sildenafil administer three time daily . Patients complete exercise testing , neurohormone , hemodynamic assessment baseline ( day 1 ) follow 24 hour sildenafil treatment . The patient discharge complete 12-week maintenance phase treatment . At conclusion maintenance phase patient readmitted 2 day repeat measurement perform . The main analysis do use paired t-tests . All statistical analysis perform use SAS v6.12 .</detailed_description>
