	<brief_summary>People might prediabetes unrecognized diabetes screen problem outpatient visit . For screening , take sugary drink contain 50 gram glucose , blood sample one hour later . The blood sample test glucose A1c ( measure blood glucose previous two month ) . They also fill questionnaire ask health history would feel exercise try lose weight find prediabetes diabetes . At subsequent visit , oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) - blood sample , sugary drink contain 75 gram glucose , repeat blood sample 2 hour later . We evaluate cost find people prediabetes diabetes . For people find problem , also evaluate well doctor treat problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RELEVANCE TO VETERANS ' HEALTH : Lack good strategy identify prediabetes - probably ~10 year prior development diabetes recognize clinically - may greatest present impediment diabetes care . We develop new way screen prediabetes , constitute major opportunity improve health ~4 million veteran ; early recognition glucose intolerance would permit institution preventive strategy efficacious , convenient , cost-effective - improve health individual veteran , reduce diabetes-related health care resource use cost VA , help spare VA fund management disorder . BACKGROUND : Prediabetes major public health problem confers risk diabetes cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , veterans prediabetes detect , receive intervention reduce risk ; CVD event , health resource use , cost rise diabetes diagnose . Diabetes prevent delayed lifestyle change medication , since identify prediabetes , glucose intolerance progress 5-10 year , many patient early diabetes complication increase CVD risk finally recognize . We develop new screen test prediabetes , `` glucose challenge test '' ( GCT ) : patient 50g oral glucose challenge time day , regardless meal status , single 1 hr sample . If GCT exceed cutoff , 75g oral glucose tolerance test overnight fast , 0 2 hr sample ( OGTT ) . Our GCRC-based Preliminary Data show ROC AUC 0.83 ( 70 % specificity , 82 % sensitivity ) $ 51 per case identify ; GCT constitute effective , convenient , inexpensive , cost-effective screen prediabetes - critical indicator individual , VA health care system , societal risk . OBJECTIVES : To translate finding improve health VA patient , GCT need implement VA primary care setting - practitioner often screen prediabetes , manage diabetes optimally . Such barrier must overcome order conduct definitive study aim show use GCT detect prediabetes ( previously unrecognized diabetes ) primary care lead improve outcome . Thus , VA policy system-wide implementation GCT screening must precede logical next step : validation demonstration likely cost-effectiveness . METHODS : AIM # 1 . Validation : ( A ) To establish feasibility , interact VA primary care provider solve logistical problem , determine optimal screen strategy . ( B ) To assess test performance , ( ) perform GCTs measure A1c ~1,800 patient , ( b ) evaluate OGTTs subject , ( c ) compare sensitivity , specificity , ROC curve GCT vs. A1c `` predictive model '' screen primary care GCRC study . Availability dataset also permit ( ) subsequent management diabetes/prediabetes evaluate relative standardize guideline . AIM # 2 . Costs : To evaluate impact , ( ) capture cost diagnostic test , staff effort , patient time ; ( b ) express cost per case identify VA health system societal perspective ; ( c ) compare GCT vs. alternative strategy wide range assumption false- ( + ) /false- ( - ) cost reflect downstream cost implication test imperfection . Engagement process also provide ( ) study patient prediabetes go develop diabetes , opportunity explore VA resource use cost diagnosis diabetes . This provide preliminary data subsequent proposal compare resource use cost vs. VA patient newly diagnose diabetes setting screen prediabetes .</detailed_description>
