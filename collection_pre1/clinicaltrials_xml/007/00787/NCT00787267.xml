	<brief_title>Phase II Study Dasatinib Previously Treated Patients With Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death United States . Twenty seventy-five percent patient initially treat surgery radiotherapy recur become candidate systemic therapy . Src expression identify majority NSCLC cell line may important hypoxic growth angiogenesis NSCLC . This phase II trial investigate activity oral Src inhibitor dasatinib advance stage NSCLC . We hypothesize inhibition Src pathway dasatinib show anti-tumor activity advance NSCLC , tolerable safety profile . Fresh frozen tissue need genomics analysis , thus biopsy required participate trial . The genomic analysis determine tumor Src-active Src-inactive response dasatinib compare . In stage I , 40 patient treat without prior knowledge tumoral Src-activity . If stage I responses observed Src-active patient , second stage accrue cohort . If response observe Src-inactive cohort , activity dasatinib genomic determination dasatinib response re-evaluated . Otherwise , Stage I , responses observed cohort , accrue separately evaluate two-stage manner . Dasatinib give orally twice daily continue progression disease , intolerable toxicity patient withdrawal . Imaging study do pre-treatment every 6 week assess radiologic response therapy . Patients follow 30 day last dose dasatinib ass toxicity .</detailed_description>
