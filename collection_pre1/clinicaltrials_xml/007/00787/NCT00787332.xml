	<criteria>1 . Provide write Informed Consent 2 . Be least 18 year age . 3 . A suspicion heparininduced thrombocytopenia without thrombosis syndrome ( HIT/TS ) due one follow clinical scenario : 1 . Patients receive heparin/LMWH receive heparin/LMWH within previous 100 day AND one following : fall platelet count &gt; 30 % baseline prior heparin/LMWH , OR thrombotic event , OR develop skin lesion secondary subcutaneous heparin ( even patient longer receive heparin therapy thrombocytopenia , thrombosis skin lesion occur ) . Patients thrombosis skin lesion need concomitant thrombocytopenia include . 2 . A rapid fall platelet count &gt; 30 % baseline within 24 hour start heparin/LMWH patient suspect exposure heparin LMWH previous 100 day ( e.g . hospitalization invasive procedure within past 100 day ) . 3 . In postoperative cardiac surgery patient , development thrombocytopenia define decrease platelet count &gt; 30 % postoperative peak ; patient whose platelet count fail increase postoperatively ( e.g . remain &lt; 100,000 mm3 Day 4 later , calendar day surgery=Day 0 ) . 4 . In patient diagnosis HIT/TS establish hematology consultant , criterion fulfil , Investigator contact Medical Monitor consideration patient 's inclusion study ( A hematology consult highly advisable , required prior randomization ) . Confirmed pregnancy ( woman childbearing potential urine serum pregnancy test ) . Patients suspect confirmed pulmonary embolism , require continue anticoagulation acute ischemic stroke exclude Cerebrovascular accident within previous 6 month Intracranial neoplasm , arteriovenous malformation aneurysm . Severe renal insufficiency determine measure estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min . Known allergy Argatroban® , Desirudin hirudin derive drug , know sensitivity component product Patients receive recombinant hirudin ( e.g . lepirudin ) within previous 6 month prior enrollment . Patients receive &gt; 2 dos fondaparinux treatment suspect HIT Multisystem organ failure estimate survival le 30 day . Participation clinical research study involve evaluation investigational drug device within 30 day enrollment Refusal undergo blood transfusion become necessary Active bleeding irreversible coagulation abnormality Uncontrolled hypertension define blood pressure &gt; 180/110 mm Hg . Patients require indwell mechanical intervention leftventricular assist device , intraaortic balloon pump , venovenous ultra filtration , etc . Severe liver disease disease condition , , judgment Investigator , would place patient undue risk enrol trial , cause inability comply trial .</criteria>
