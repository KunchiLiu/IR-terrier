	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test experimental drug call ZT-031 help men 30 year post-menopausal woman 55 year age certain type hip fracture heal well faster follow surgery determine ZT-031 safe patient fracture . To allow study type hip fracture require surgery study ( intertrochanteric fracture ) . You must also otherwise good health , serious disease cancer , neurologic disease , bone disease , liver , heart kidney disease . You must able inject every day study medication use injection pen , like use insulin injection .</brief_summary>

Clinically acceptable medical history physical examination , accord judgment Investigator . 11 . Laboratory result within normal range , abnormal , consider Investigator clinically significant wellbeing subject purpose study . The following additional criterion require randomization dose ZT031 placebo occur : 12 . The recent value 25hydroxy Vitamin D ( 25OHD ) must lower limit normal ( LLN ) laboratory reference range test method use determination 25OHD . NOTE : Randomization delay know 25OHD ≥ LLN . 13 . The recent value intact PTH must ≤ ULN laboratory reference range . 14 . Randomization dose must occur within 2 week postop . Exclusion Criteria Subjects meet follow condition exclude clinical study : 1 . Previous fracture ( ) bone joint surgery currently fracture site 2 . Intertrochanteric fracture reverse obliquity 3 .
