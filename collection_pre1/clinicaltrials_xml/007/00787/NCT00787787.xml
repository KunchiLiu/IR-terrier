	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give sunitinib malate together capecitabine work treat patient unresectable metastatic liver cancer . Sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving sunitinib malate together capecitabine may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Capecitabine Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival patient unresectable metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) treat sunitinib capecitabine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival , response rate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RESIST ) criterion , alpha fetoprotein ( AFP ) response , survival one year , safety tolerability . OUTLINE : Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 capecitabine PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
