	<brief_summary>This research NIH single site study aim ( 1 ) determine whether surgically induced weight loss decrease risk CVD morbidly obese subject T2DM . ( 2 ) elucidate mechanism surgically induce weight loss reduces time risk CVD morbidly obsess subject T2DM . Study'subjects enrol obese individual type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . The study include two group , subject undergo gastric bypass surgery control group undergo weight loss surgery . A total 60 subject ( 30 group ) recruit . Basal , 6 12 month assessment include : insulin sensitivity determination , cardiovascular function echo doppler , DEXA scan . This study involve risk-level II procedure , however , risk inherent gastric bypass surgery consider study-derived subject enrol individual already decide surgery . We determine protein expression profile inflammation-related adipokines subcutaneous intra-abdominal adipose tissue morbidly obese subject T2DM surgically induce weight loss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) likely die cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) people without diabetes . Furthermore , Patients diabetes benefit advance management CVD and/or risk factor result decrease mortality CVD patient without diabetes . Short-term study demonstrate weight loss weight obese subject T2DM associate decreased insulin resistance , substantial improvement glycemic lipoprotein profile , reduction blood pressure . However , Long-term data substantiate improvement maintain limited . Obesity , susceptibility weight gain , chronic condition . Continuous care require avoid weight regain especially intensive weigh loss . Morbidly obese patient body mass index ( BMI ) 35 kg/m2 significant difficulty maintain weight loss adequate resolve obesity-related medical condition change lifestyle pharmacologic strategy . Currently , surgical treatment morbid obesity , term bariatric surgery , appear modality result significant sustained weight loss along reversal diabetes improvement cholesterol biosynthesis , lipoprotein metabolism morbidly obese patient . Given observation , question patient T2DM undergo gastric bypass surgery significantly reduce level abnormality vascular structure function central development atherosclerosis . In specific aim 1 , determine whether surgically induced weight loss decrease risk CVD morbidly obese subject T2DM . . In specific aim 2 , elucidate mechanism surgically induce weight loss reduces time risk CVD morbidly obsess subject T2DM . The propose study prospective cohort clinic trial aim evaluate change time cardiovascular structure function morbidly obese subject T2DM undergo gastric bypass surgery compare match control group undergo gastric bypass surgery . The result propose study provide foundation new clinic strategy aim prevent development CVD obese patient T2DM . Furthermore , serve baseline future large scale longitudinal study base aggregate occurrence severe cardiovascular event .</detailed_description>
