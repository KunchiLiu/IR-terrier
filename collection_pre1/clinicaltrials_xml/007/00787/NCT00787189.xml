	<brief_title>Study Low Level Laser Therapy Word Recognition Hearing Impaired Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sensorineural hearing loss account 90 % hearing loss find 23 % individual older 65 year . Sensorineural hearing loss occur hair cell inner ear neural pathway auditory cortex damage . In case , sensorineural hearing loss improve , reverse 'cured . ' Current treatment option focus method amplify external sound teach patient various strategy 'retrain ' brain interpret external stimulus . Low Level Laser Therapy first apply treatment inner ear disease Uwe Witt , MD Hamburg , Germany 1980 's . Hearing impaired patient inflammation and/or atrophy tissue neural pathway connect support cochlea 's cilia hair structure , hear mechanism inner ear . Low level laser therapy believe stimulate mitochondrion adipocyte cell , subsequently increase production ATP . The resultant surge ATP production work repair damage tissue regenerate cell reverse damage incur cochlea thus improve aspect hear function .</detailed_description>
