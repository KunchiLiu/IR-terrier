	<brief_summary>The natural history cirrhosis symptomatic asymptomatic stage . The symptom include development ascites , hepatic encephalopathy , variceal bleeding . The development portal hypertension represent critical transition point natural history cirrhosis , contribute , directly responsible event . It define increase intrahepatic vascular resistance portal venous inflow , subsequent development collateral vessel , esophageal gastric varix . As portal pressure rise time , however , result increase variceal size wall tension translate increase likelihood rupture bleeding , lead death 30 % patient . Over last twenty year , data emerge regard role tumor necrosis factor ( TNFÎ± ) portal hypertension animal model well vitro experiment . Portal hypertension condition characterize vasodilatation hyperdynamic circulation , driven relative overproduction nitric oxide23 . In animal trial use inhibitor TNF show decrease development hyperdynamic circulatory state portal pressure.24-25 Based data , investigator examine role TNF inhibition thalidomide . Significant improvement block development hyperdynamic circulation portal pressure demonstrated.26 Human trial also show efficacy thalidomide reduce portal pressure . In trial show promising result investigation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Secondary Prophylaxis Gastrointestinal Bleeding Cirrhotic Patients Using THALIDOMIDE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment duration thalidomide 16 week , begin hospital set immediately index bleed , clinical follow-up additional six month . Follow-up hepatology , outpatient clinic area endoscopy suite occur . Step wise thalidomide dose 100 mg/d day night . If evidence toxicity note 5 dos , dose increase 200 mg/d , continue dose outpatient completion study protocol 16 week . Patients follow daily inpatient , subsequently two-week interval upon discharge . Females child-bearing potential see weekly first month must confirm negative pregnancy test prior dispense next one week supply study drug . After first month , females child-bearing potential see every two week subject . Standard follow-up medical care esophageal variceal bleed patient undergone endoscopic therapy include : follow-up endoscopy regular interval variceal obliteration , use either endoscopic variceal ligation ( EVL ) sclerotherapy titrate dose nonselective beta blocker ( propranolol ) . At follow-up visit , patient assess development interim outcome interest : overt upper gastrointestinal bleed need transfusion worsen clinical status Patients initially follow daily hospitalize . outpatient visit occur every two-week interval upon discharge . Standard follow-up medical care esophageal variceal bleed patient undergone endoscopic therapy include : follow-up endoscopy regular interval variceal obliteration , use either endoscopic variceal ligation ( EVL ) sclerotherapy titrate dose nonselective beta blocker ( propranolol ) . At follow-up visit , patient assess development interim outcome interest : overt upper gastrointestinal bleed need transfusion worsen clinical status need TIPS , liver transplantation death . In addition , patient family question evidence potential toxicity assess use CTC Toxicity grade version 3 , adverse outcomes one study investigator well nurse coordinator , use standardized questionnaire along regular clinical</detailed_description>
