	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect specific activity without early therapeutic mobility ( ETM ) protocol among patient experience three day mechanical ventilation . A second purpose examine staff/delivery system patient factor influence initiation progression activity without ETM protocol . The hypothesis ETM protocols result improved patient outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Modes Progressive Mobility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim study : 1 . Compare patient response select mode therapy ( activity ) without ETM protocol 1 . Molecular response : marker inflammation interleukin ( IL ) -6 IL-10 2 . Physiological response : peripheral oxygen saturation , heart rate , blood pressure , new dysrhythmias 3 . Safety/Unsafe event include pain , fatigue , line tube dislodgement , fall near fall 2 . Determine association duration level activity/ETM achieve outcome : 1. occurrence delirium 2. occurrence ventilator associate pneumonia 3. occurrence deep vein thrombosis pulmonary emboli 4. occurrence acquire pressure ulcer 5. muscle strength 6. number day mechanically ventilate 7. discharge location ( ICU ) 3 . Describe strategy use ICU initiate implement activity without ETM protocol 1. use personnel register nurse , physical therapist , respiratory therapist nursing assistant 2. use equipment walker , lift device , belt bed 3. perception sufficient time ability 4 . Describe patient factor associate implementation ETM 1 . Potentially modifiable exemplar : sedation , site vascular access , physician order 2 . Potentially nonmodifiable exemplar : weight , consciousness , hemodynamic instability , terminal condition This prospective , longitudinal , repeat measure study control period , run-in period intervention period . Data collect three period comparison . During control period , patient receive standard care . Standard care institution include program progressive early mobility include activity similar ETM protocol , implement discretion staff . During run-in period , subject receive mix standard care intervention .</detailed_description>
