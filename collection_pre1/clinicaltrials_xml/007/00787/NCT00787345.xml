	<detailed_description>Central line associate bloodstream infection ( CL-ABI ) important preventable cause nosocomial infection responsible considerable morbidity mortality . It estimate 5 26 % patient experience infectious complication central venous catheter [ 1 ] . In United States , estimate nearly 50,000 patient develop central line associate bloodstream infection ICUs annually , rate approximately 5 infection per 1000 catheter day [ 2 ] many 15,000 death annually . Central line associate bloodstream infection also associate increase hospital ICU length stay ICU ( 2 ) . Estimates cost CL-ABI hospital range $ 25,000 $ 65,000 per patient [ 3 , 4 ] . The Centers Disease Control publish guideline prevention CL-ABI represent collaborative effort multidisciplinary coalition professional organization provide evidence base recommendation prevent catheter relate infection [ 5 ] . The intervention emphasize five distinct practice , include : education training healthcare provider place care catheter , utilize maximum sterile barrier precaution catheter placement , skin preparation use 2 % chlorhexidine , avoid routine replacement central line strategy reduce infection , use antiseptic antibiotic coat line event infection rate remain high despite adherence measure [ 5 ] . Several study demonstrate impressive reduction CL-ABI application strategy , range 18 100 % reduction realize significant reduction mortality cost [ 2 ] . The simple introduction maximum sterile barrier precaution insert central line observe dramatically reduce infection rate decade [ 6 ] . However , CDC 's guideline , despite seem simplicity , find frequently insufficiently apply , whether ignorance omission [ 2 ] . In past 12 month total 24 documented central venous line ( CVL ) infection SLRHC cumulative rate infection 3.8 per 1000 central line day . These infection rate figure benchmark experience . For SLRHC cost incur past 12 month estimate $ 1,080,000 . Training education healthcare personnel utilization maximum sterile precaution two important area . Residents still frequently learn central line placement technique `` see one , one , teach one '' method , definition allows multitude technique practice . While teach theoretically include utilization maximal sterile precaution central line placement , focus teaching , resident ' anxiety , often focused proper placement line , sterile technique use place . Guzzo et al find mentor trainee perform CVC placement emergent non-emergent situation significantly less likely consistently utilize maximum sterile precaution [ 8 ] . Furthermore , study video-based training sterile technique CVC insertion trauma resuscitation unit evaluate non-emergent CVC placement , total 5 case central- catheter- relate bacteremia report 68 patient , even video base training , 26 % resident continue infraction compliance sterile precaution [ 9 ] . Medical simulator allow resident practice skill realistic interactive environment minimizes risk patient . Studies find simulation effective mean teach skill diverse ACLS airway management laparoscopic surgical skill [ 10,11,12 ] . Additionally , use audio-visual equipment medical simulator record resident 's performance give valuable firsthand feedback otherwise available , allow resident visualize misstep [ 13 ] . This hypothesize particular value proper acquisition physical skill maximum sterile precaution . With mind , Department Surgery recently approve training policy aseptic technique central venous access placement ( see attach copy ) . All GS resident train MBP technique Sim Lab . Training include baseline assessment resident skill maintain maximum sterile precaution use standardized score tool , videotape training , short exam , individual simulate debrief performance correct MBP follow assessment training need . We plan collect data prospectively GS resident undergo evaluation training maximum barrier precaution CVC placement . Data review analyzed future research publication C METHODS : I . Inclusion criterion : General Surgery ( GS ) resident undergo evaluation training MBP accord department training policy . II . Design : A . All GS resident undergo evaluation training MBP CVC placement per department policy eligible study . B . All data collect purpose Education Quality Improvement GS resident , undergo evaluation training ( per standard department policy ) MBP CVC placement review analyze deidentified purpose study . C. Waiver Subject inform consent HIPPA authorization request minimal risk study data thus conclusion would greatly improve use data subject . There could selection bias use data resident felt do good job . Other criterion need waiver subject inform consent HIPPA authorization list : 1 . Minimal risk study : This observational , non-interventional study . The research part study prospective data collection purpose analysis aggregate data possible publication . Training resident MBP per describe protocol set accord approved hospital policy purpose quality improvement . The risk subject potential loss confidentiality , investigator minimize risk deidentifying data describe section III ( Confidentiality ) research data delete six month follow-up complete 2 . There reason believe waiving informed consent affect right welfare subject enrol since subject identify name form identity . Also , subject inform final project result include subject review group personal identification include result . 3 . This research may carry without waiver result thus conclusion would greatly improve use data subject . There could selection bias use result resident felt do good job 4 . This research may benefit subject directly understand limitation previous training ( lack ) MBP note analyze result , likely yield generalizable knowledge would benefit subject similar condition . 5 . This area research directly relate condition potential subject might able give consent 6 . Whenever appropriate subject provide additional pertinent information participation state protocol 7 . Protections take protect confidentiality subject outline Confidentiality section D. Information sheet provide resident participate project explain purpose project , confidentiality protection data potentially report , E. GS resident may repeat performance ( 3-6 month ) MBP technique central line placement individually discretion residency program director . If , data collect analyzed reviewed . III . Confidentiality : All aggregate data kept secure part research database password protect . No supervisor access aggregate data / able compare individual resident 's performance rest group database . All session sim lab videotape automatically . All videotape session title identify name cod ( i.e sim session medical code session 6 June 08 ) . All videotape review periodically delete except kept educational purpose . These videotape identify subject study number phase ( i.e . CVLN 01 phase 1 ) . In project , videotape subject performance purpose train , quality improvement . The research part project involve review data collect instructor assessment tool unrelated videotaping . IV . Data Analysis The overall performance score MBP technique , include overall maximum seven component analyze . The effect simulation base training performance , realize performance score improvement baseline , evaluate use Wilcoxon signed-rank test . A p-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant</detailed_description>
