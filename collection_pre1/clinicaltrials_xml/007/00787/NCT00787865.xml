	<brief_title>Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) Infants With Krabbe Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design learn early brain development child Krabbe disease use diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) early diagnostic tool differentiate child infantile Krabbe disease newborn disease free low enzyme level . Additionally , study determine certain structure brain develop 24 month child infantile Krabbe disease without disease low enzyme level . This study also reveal information learn motor development child , help researcher predict outcomes treatment . Krabbe disease rare , childhood neurodegenerative disorder cause galactocerebrosidase deficiency . It result rapid demyelination , progressive spasticity , mental deterioration , blindness , deafness , seizure , death . Based previously publish finding , treatment unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation standard Krabbe disease , provide treatment occurs within first week life symptom appear . Once newborns identify population screening , objective measure predict baby develop frequent rapidly progressive infantile form Krabbe slow juvenile adult form . Phenotype genotype correlation possible 150 mutation cause disease many polymorphism normal population affect enzyme level . There urgent clinical need develop predictive measure . To date , available tool classify infant infantile versus later form . New advance neuroimaging technique enable scientist quantify change brain growth myelination early life disease symptom develop . Knowledge study help identify window opportunity early intervention treatment prevent severe disability , may lead good treatment strategy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Positive newborn screen test ( low galactocerebrosidase ) 2 . Infantile Krabbe Disease diagnose confirmatory low level residual enzyme Dr. Wenger 's Lysosmal Storage Diseases laboratory Jefferson 's Medical College ( contracted New York State ) and/or carrier status establish family history Krabbe Disease . Patients le 6 week old time first assessment 3 . Children risk develop motor disability 1 . Diagnosis physical sign know genetic condition syndrome , serious medical neurological condition affect growth development ( e.g. , seizure disorder , diabetes , congenital heart disease ) sensory impairment vision hearing loss 2 . Children may suffer serious perinatal brain damage , child birth weight less 2000 gram and/or gestational age le 34 week , history intraventricular hemorrhage 3 . Children may contraindication MRI ( pacemaker , vascular stent , metallic ear tube , metal implant brace ) .</criteria>
