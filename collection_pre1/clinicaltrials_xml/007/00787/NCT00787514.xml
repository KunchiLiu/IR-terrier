	<brief_summary>The folate receptor ( FR ) cell express surface certain cancer , occur frequently ovarian cancer . Some normal tissue also express FR , however normal tissue , FR usually locate tissue surface inaccessible circulate drug . As , drug target FR may potentially use target cancer overexpress FR reduce toxicity normal tissue . Therefore ability measure FR level different cancer type may help select patient likely benefit treatment FR target therapy . Once drug BGC945 currently test preclinical study Institute Cancer Research</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FR Stored Plasma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FR may release cancer cell blood . We develop method laboratory able measure FR obtain cancer cell culture add blood . We would like study method able measure FR store plasma sample obtain patient ovarian cancer , may develop method select patient FR-target treatment BGC 945 .</detailed_description>
