	<brief_summary>In study , Visualase Thermal Therapy System use metastatic brain tumor remove surgery . Researchers want find possible use new device subject 1-3 metastatic brain tumor ( ) , measure 3 centimeter ( cm ) small . The safety device also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Laser Induced Thermal Therapy Treatment Metastatic Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Visualase Thermal Therapy System FDA-cleared thermal destruction soft tissue neurosurgery MRI guidance . The device combine 3 previously FDA-cleared device : Visualase Cooled Laser Application System , delivers laser ( energy ) tumor tissue ; PhoTex , Diode Laser Series , laser ; Visualase ENVISION Workstation , computer system help surgeon plan monitor treatment . The Visualase Thermal Therapy System use study give subject type therapy call Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy ( LITT ) . LITT use laser light heat destroy affect tissue ; sometimes refer tissue ablation . In LITT , small fiber-optic applicator place directly tumor heating perform inside , may lead destruction tumor . During heat process , MRTI use watch temperature around applicator make sure tumor receive enough treatment normal tissue around tumor get hot .</detailed_description>
