	<brief_summary>Idiopathic Small Fiber Neuropathy ( call SFN short ) , condition nerve sense pain become damage , often painful . SFN pain common , affect sleep , memory , health overall quality life . Pregabalin drug commonly use treat painful condition , like nerve pain . It available doctor many year , many study perform evaluate effectiveness . In study , pregabalin show effective treatment nerve pain , few side effect many medication currently available . The purpose study determine pregabalin relief pain effectively pill contain medication ( call placebo ) . The study also investigate side effect well effectiveness safety medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Pregabalin Idiopathic Small Fiber Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Painful small fiber sensory neuropathy ( SFN ) relatively common disable medical condition . It common type painful sensory neuropathy patient older 50 year age . It define neuropathy exclusively predominantly affect A-δ ( small myelinated ) nociceptive C ( unmyelinated ) nerve fiber function . The neuropathic pain associate SFN describe patient burn ( `` foot fire '' ) , sharp ( `` knife-like , jab pin needle '' ) , shoot , ache pain toe foot . The foot describe tingle , numb , feel tight , wooden dead . The pain disable often exacerbate night interfere disrupt sleep pattern . Allodynia cramp may also occur . Some patient also describe pressure induce pain foot stand walking . The autonomic nerve may involve lead increase decreased sweating , facial flushing , skin discoloration erectile dysfunction 40 % male . On examination dramatic mismatch symptom observable deficit SFN . Only abnormal finding loss pinprick temperature sensation foot may extend knee . Touch sensation may diminish sensation usually preserve . By definition , patient SFN allow minor involvement large fiber distally reduce vibration toe ankle reflex usually preserve . This study crossover design thus minimize number subject need . Each patient act his/her control . Previous study pregabalin show desired effect achieve eight week treatment . Therefore patient start either placebo pregabalin . They assess treatment arm eight week . There two-week drug taper washout period switch treatment , follow re-assessment additional eight week . This design minimize amount time patient treat placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis idiopathic SFN ( base clinical electrodiagnostic criterion ) . Each day 7 day prior Visit 2 ( Washout ) must complete modified Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale₁ show moderate severe pain ( i.e . daily mean rating score ≥ 4 ) . As safety pregabalin pregnancy establish , females childbearing potential must negative βHCG serum agree practice acceptable birth control method . All subject must screen laboratory value within normal limit abnormal value deem clinically significant Principle Investigator . Have psychological psychiatric condition may hinder ability provide important information History psychosis , drug alcohol abuse history within last year Malignancy within last 2 year ( except skin cancer ) Clinically significant condition ( include limit cardiovascular hepatic disease ) , seizure disorder . Subjects abnormal 2hour glucose tolerance test ( i.e. , glucose &gt; 7.8 mmol/l ) exclude `` clinically significant condition '' state . May participate previous trial pregabalin , history intolerance hypersensitivity pregabalin . Patients renal impairment ( CrCl &lt; 60 ml/min ) exclude .</criteria>
