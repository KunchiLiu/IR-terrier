	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand S-nitrosohemeglobin ( SNO-Hb ) transfuse blood extremely preterm infant . The long term goal project identify variation SNO-Hb pack red blood cell unit , among individual preterm infant pre post-transfusion . Duke investigator develop method replenish SNO-Hb , , successful , would improve RBC deformation addition provide vasodilatory stimulation hypoxic tissue , lead randomize clinical trial test treat vs. untreated RBC transfusion extremely premature infant . AIM 1 . Measure Total Hemoglobin ( Hb ) -bound nitric oxide ( NO ) , Hb [ Fe ] NO , SNO-Hb ( calculate value = ( total Hb-NO - Hb [ Fe ] NO ) blood transfuse extremely preterm baby , sample pre post- transfusion baby . Hypothesis 1 : Measures NO SNO-Hb low blood use transfusion preterm infant decrease post-transfusion sample infant compare pre-transfusion sample . AIM 2 . Collect clinical data study participant , include oxygen saturation measure perfusion pre post-transfusion . Hypothesis 2 : Measures perfusion reduce 20 % post-transfusion extremely preterm infant .</brief_summary>
