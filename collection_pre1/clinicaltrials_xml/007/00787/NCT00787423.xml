	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers interested develop accurate method assess environmental influence psychological stress drug use . One key accurate assessment environmental influence minimize delay exposure reporting . Portable device personal digital assistant ( PDAs ) global positioning system ( GPS ) unit may able provide real-time image factor . Objectives : - To assess use PDAs measure stress drug use , GPS unit assess effect neighborhood environment outpatient treatment population . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 75 year age current heroin user seek treatment addiction spend time Baltimore city . - Participants must able visit research treatment center least three time per week regular test . Design : - Participants study approximately 28 week ( 7 month ) . - A series three laboratory session examine responsiveness standardize stressor occur early treatment repeat late treatment . - Participants undergo 18 week daily methadone maintenance . Urine sample collect three time weekly . - To track drug use , stress , geographical location ( measure environmental risk ) , participant carry PDA GPS unit 16 18 week . Participants make entry ( 1 ) time use drug ( 2 ) time feel overwhelm , anxious , stressed usual . Participants also make three random-signal-triggered recording per day one brief ( end day ) recording . - Retrospective self-report questionnaire drug use stress give regularly . - After 18 week methadone maintenance , participant discontinue carry PDA GPS unit choice transfer community clinic undergoing 10-week taper methadone research clinic . Participants stay taper continue provide urine sample , week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background . This protocol arise response NIH Genes Environment Initiative ( GEI ) . There genetic component protocol ( update : genetics initially add amendment February 2013 ) ; rather , goal develop field-deployable measure environmental influence ( stressor , drug exposure , etc . ) ultimately used study gene-environment interaction . &lt; TAB &gt; Objective . To use Smartphones ( PDAs ) measure stress drug use ; Global Positioning System ( GPS ) unit assess geographical location ; biological sample genetic testing ; Daysimeters Dimesimeters assess circadian rhythm ; AutoSense collect ambulatory physiological activity data real time ; assess feasibility acceptability mobile HIV/STD Risk Reduction ( HIVRR ) deliver via PDA real time . Participant population . Opioid-dependent outpatient adult ( 400 enrol ; 300 completers ) . Target enrollment include 40 % woman 60 % minority ( mostly African-American ) . Experimental design . A natural-history study stress ( personal environmental ) drug use . Methods . Participants undergo 22 week daily methadone buprenorphine/naloxone ( henceforth buprenorphine ) maintenance offer least 8 week methadone buprenorphine taper ( week 23-30 ) . To track drug use , stress , geographical location ( measure environmental risk ) , participant carry PDA GPS unit 16 first 18 week . Event-triggered entry initiate participant ( 1 ) time use drug ( 2 ) time feel overwhelm , anxious , stressed usual . Participants also make 3 random-signal-triggered recording per day one brief end day record . We compare EMA result traditional assessment drug use stress : ( 1 ) urine collect three time weekly week 1-22 weekly optional methadone buprenorphine taper ( week 23-30 ) , ( 2 ) retrospective self-report questionnaire drug use stress give regularly , ( 3 ) laboratory session examine responsiveness standardize stressor occur 4th 6th week . Blood draw anthropometric measurement assess allostatic load ( physiological marker long-term cumulative stress ) blood sample obtain genetic analysis 2nd 4th week . After week 12 , also assess impact opioid agonist treatment hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis involve modulating stress . After 18 week opioid agonist maintenance , participant begin additional 4 week maintenance , carry PDA GPS unit unless participate secondary study include measure . At end 22 week , participant choice transfer community clinic undergoing eight-week taper Archway clinic . Secondary study : Up 70 participant ask wear Daysimeter Actigraph activity-monitor wristwatch 18 day ( two 72-hour interval repeat three time ) Dimesimeter daily ( 24 hours/day ) 16 week . Up 80 participant ask wear AutoSense four 1-week period , include laboratory session . Up 40 participant enrol mHIVRR evaluation program 4 week Maintenance Phase ( complete October 2013 ) . Up 100 participant ask wear SleepProfiler 7 night assess sleep architecture . Primary outcome measure : ( 1 ) EMA report drug use psychosocial stress , ( 2 ) real-time assessment environmental risk exposure measure via integration GPS data Neighborhood Psychosocial Index . Data methadone buprenorphine group analyze separately primary outcome measure combine appropriate . Secondary outcome measure : To determine feasibility acceptability use ( 1 ) Daysimeter/Dimesimeter Actigraph collect real-time field data light exposure impact circadian rhythm , ( 2 ) Autosense collect real-time field data physiological function . Also , ( 3 ) combine Daysimeter/Dimesimeter data electronic-diary data determine whether heroin/cocaine user experience circadian disruption , , disruption relate psychosocial stress illicit drug use , ( 4 ) combine Autosense data electronic-diary data determine physiological response trigger use inform drug relapse prevention effort , ( 5 ) To determine feasibility acceptability interactive mHIVRR software program deliver counsel HIV education , determine whether reduce HIV-related risk via increase HIV/STD knowledge , ( 6 ) determine HPA axis normal least 3 month opioid agonist treatment , ( 7 ) incorporate genetic characteristic predictor EMA GMA data behavioral measure , ( 8 ) ass objectively measure sleep quality associate EMA-reported psychosocial stress reward responsiveness , geographical exposure stressful rewarding environment , ( 9 ) determine feasibility use up-to-date EMA interface device , examine relationship opioid withdrawal symptom successful taper methadone buprenorphine maintenance ( 10 ) obtain qualitative data participant perception environment , order inform future work help explain participant seem well disorder environment .</detailed_description>
