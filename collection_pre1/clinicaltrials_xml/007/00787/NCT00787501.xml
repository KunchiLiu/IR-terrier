	<brief_summary>Our goal 1 ) use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) predict depressed individual respond different validated treatment unipolar depression include Cognitive Therapy ( CT ) antidepressant medication ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ; SSRIs ) 2 ) understand whether CT SSRIs affect similar aspect brain function underlie cognition emotion . Thus , examine depress adult age 18-55 use fMRI cognitive emotional information processing task , treatment SSRI ( n=25 ) CT ( n=40 ) . We hypothesize : 1 ) Recovery occur treatment SSRI primarily individual increase reactivity limbic brain region associate emotion generation prefrontal region associate regulation , . 2 ) Recovery CT occur patient increase activity brain region associate emotion generation decrease activity prefrontal region associate emotion regulation . 3 ) Recovery SSRI yield similar change brain function CT brain region associate emotion generation less change brain region responsible emotion regulation prefrontal cortex . Findings study may profound impact reduce burden clinical depression provide evidenced-based diagnostic treatment guideline .</brief_summary>
