	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well bevacizumab work treat patient sex cord-stromal tumor ovary come back . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Recurrent Sex Cord-Stromal Tumors Ovary</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate anti-tumor activity bevacizumab assess frequency objective response patient recurrent sex cord-stromal tumor ovary measurable disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine nature degree toxicity patient . II . To determine overall survival progression-free survival patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To quantify expression angiogenic lymphangiogenic marker recurrent stromal tumor ovary determine frequency alteration potential utility biologic agent direct protein inclusion future study . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
