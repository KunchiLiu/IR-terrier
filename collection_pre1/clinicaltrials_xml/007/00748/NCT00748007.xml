	<brief_title>Efficacy Rivastigmine Patients With Down Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Down syndrome ( DS ) common cause mental retardation due chromosome anomaly . Besides defect cognition , DS patient 30 yea old early dementia . Etiology early dementia know related APP gene dosage triplication similar neuropathological change Alzheimer disease ( AD ) . It known cognitive degeneration AD relate decrement cholinergic neuron brain . And clinical improvement delay degeneration cognitive function utilization cholinesterase inhibitor observe mild moderate AD patient . In DS brain , also note low acetylcholine , support relationship pathology DS AD . Since 1999 , Kishnani et al start treat adult DS patient cholinesterase inhibitor ( Donepezil ) . Data show improvement cognition life quality DS patient dementia . Recently , data show low cholinergic neuron DS brain might cause cognitive dysfunction DS . Therefore , early treatment cholinesterase inhibitor DS patient propose alleviate cognitive dysfunction . Since 2004 , Kishnani et al start treat DS child Donepezil Rivastigmine . Some patient show improvement language ability , memory , attention . We go conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover design , 12-month trial . Subjects enrol study randomize two group . Each group receive Rivastigmine placebo different order 6 month . Neuropsychological assessment include Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales NEPSY evaluate medication . Through , wish understand efficacy drug role improve cognitive functioning patient .</detailed_description>
