	<brief_summary>There grow evidence neuropeptides act neuronal messenger brain diverse function may include regulation mood behavior . For example , neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) think play role adaptive stress response . The therapeutic application neuropeptides psychiatric disorder limit difficult unreliable penetration blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) . However , recent data suggest intranasal administration may provide mean effectively deliver neuropeptides brain . Thus far unclear case NPY . The aim project : 1 . To evaluate , 15 healthy male volunteer age 25-45 , effect intranasal NPY administration ( 0 , 50 100 nmol ) level cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , measure mean lumbar puncture use intraspinal catheter L4 L5 , plasma , measure use intravenous catheter forearm . One three treatment administer participant double-blind fashion . The 0 nmol condition serve placebo control . 2 . To test effect intranasal NPY administration mood anxiety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There grow evidence neuropeptides , include neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) , act neuronal messenger brain diverse neurobehavioral function . Their therapeutic application psychiatric disorder limit , however , difficult unreliable penetration blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) . The BBB prevent use many therapeutic agent treat central nervous system ( CNS ) disorder . Several molecule successfully administer intranasal delivery , however , thanks unique connection nerve involve sense odor chemical provide CNS environment . NPY , abundant peptide mammalian brain , co-localized norepinephrine sympathetic nerve fiber longstanding interest research group ( Morgan et al. , 2002 ; Morgan et al. , 2003 ; Morgan et al. , 2001 ; Morgan et al. , 2000 ; Rasmusson et al. , 2000 ; Rasmusson et al. , 1998 ) potential role modulate mood anxiety . NPY implicate factor adaptive stress response ( Thorsell et al. , 1999 ) , show impact consolidation fear-related memory shock ( Flood et al. , 1989 ) . Clinically , low plasma NPY level correlate great psychological distress , increase symptom dissociation , poor performance among active duty military personnel . Acute stress human find elicit NPY release , manner parallel change cortisol norepinephrine usually see , blunt plasma NPY response response yohimbine ( Morgan et al. , 2002 ) . Baseline NPY level combat veteran PTSD reduce compare healthy non-traumatized individual ( Rasmusson et al. , 2000 ) . Another study find repeat exposure traumatic stress , rather presence PTSD PTSD-type symptom , associate reduction baseline plasma NPY ( Morgan et al. , 2003 ) . A recent report find deceased CSF concentration NPY patient treatment resistant unipolar major depression ( Heilig et al 2004 ) . In summary , suggestion study patient anxiety mood disorder well healthy volunteer abnormal regulation peptide . In study , evaluate intranasal administration NPY healthy male volunteer age 25-45 use specialized delivery device . Pending initial feasibility tolerability healthy volunteer , future protocol examine effect intranasal NPY administration patient disorder PTSD , major depression , panic disorder , social anxiety disorder .</detailed_description>
