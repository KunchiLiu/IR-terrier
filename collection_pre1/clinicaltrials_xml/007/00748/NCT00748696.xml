	<brief_summary>Age-related sarcopenia associate increased morbidity , mortality , disability reduce resistance metabolic stress . The aim study assess effect resistance training , associate oral nutritional supplement , skeletal muscle mass sarcopenic subject . This prospective randomise control single-centre study last two year , three month participant . 200 healthy elderly ( 70-80 year old ) subject screen sarcopenia dual energy X-ray absorptiometry . 128 sarcopenic subject randomize 4 group : - group 1 : control - group 2 : oral nutritional supplement ( 260 kcal 20 g protein per day ) - group 3 : resistance training ( 3 time per week ) - group 4 : oral nutritional supplement + resistance training Every subject assess begin end 12 week intervention : - muscle mass ( DXA ) - muscle function ( dynamometer ) - hormonal ( testosterone , GH , IGF-1 , cortisol ) inflammatory ( IL-6 , TNF-alpha ) profile - food intake . Ten subject group 4 undergo muscle biopsy ( quadriceps ) intervention order explore protein mRNA level mTOR pathway , may involve sarcopenia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Age-related sarcopenia common situation define muscle mass function loss otherwise healthy elderly person . Epidemiological data USA show 49 % men 72 % woman suffer sarcopenia . Few data available French population . Sarcopenia associate increased morbidity , mortality , disability reduce resistance metabolic stress . Resistance train nutrition two non-pharmaceutical method may able prevent several age-related condition . The aim study assess effect resistance training , associate oral nutritional supplement , skeletal muscle mass ( express skeletal muscle mass index ) sarcopenic subject . This prospective randomise control single-centre study last two year , three month participant . 200 healthy elderly ( 70-80 year old ) subject screen sarcopenia dual energy X-ray absorptiometry . 128 sarcopenic subject randomize 4 group : - group 1 : control - group 2 : oral nutritional supplement ( 260 kcal 20 g protein per day ) - group 3 : resistance training ( 3 time per week ) - group 4 : oral nutritional supplement + resistance training Every subject assess begin end 12 week intervention : - muscle mass ( DXA ) - muscle function ( dynamometer ) - hormonal ( testosterone , GH , IGF-1 , cortisol ) inflammatory ( IL-6 , TNF-alpha ) profile - food intake . Ten subject group 4 undergo muscle biopsy ( quadriceps ) intervention order explore protein mRNA level mTOR pathway , may involve sarcopenia . We expect show sarcopenia improve 12 week resistance training improvement potentialized oral nutritional supplement ( stimulation mTOR pathway ) , oral nutritional supplement alone affect neither muscle mass function .</detailed_description>
