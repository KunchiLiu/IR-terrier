	<brief_title>The Relationship Abdominal Circumference Trunk Length With Level Spinal Anesthesia Obstetric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The level spinal anesthesia obstetric patient investigate several study . Increased cephalad spread local anesthetic demonstrate increased intra-abdominal pressure , change anteroposterior spinal curve lumbar lordosis . Theoretically body shape might contribution factor might influence spinal level . In research plan investigate relationship abdominal circumference , trunk length level spinal anesthesia obstetric patient Cesarean section . Only C/S patient indicate scheduled spinal anesthesia observe . The spinal anesthesia perform routine practice . This study change clinical plan aspect . We passively record abdominal circumference , trunk length level spinal anesthesia calculate correlation .</detailed_description>
