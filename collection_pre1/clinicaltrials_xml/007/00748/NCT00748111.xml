Recent data suggest acute coronary occlusion cause plaque erosion rupture follow intense local inflammation rapid thrombus formation . Our hypothesis speed thrombus formation coronary occlusion determines clinical symptom .

	<detailed_description>Sudden death natural death occur within one hour onset symptom . It remain major public health problem account 5 10 % annual total mortality ie 40 000 death France 300.000 United States . ( 1 ) Despite community-based intervention , overall survival remain 5 % . ( 2 ) Better understand mechanism cause sudden death could allow early identification high risk subject implementation specific prevention strategy . ( 3 ) The cause 90 % sudden death cardiac ventricular fibrillation fast ventricular tachycardia complicate underlying heart disease . ( 4 ) Coronary heart disease consequence account least 80 % sudden cardiac death hypertrophic dilated cardiomyopathy account another 10 15 % cardiac cause . ( 4,5 ) Several risk factor associate sudden death myocardial infarction identify population-based study . ( 6-10 ) However , relationship occurrence coronary artery occlusion onset arrhythmia unclear.The Framingham study report sudden death occur without prior manifestation coronary heart disease 50 % men 65 % woman . ( 11 ) Data 10 country WHO MONICA PROJECT show sudden death frequent non sudden coronary death age 60 . ( figure ) . In study value immediate coronary angiography angioplasty survivor SCD , recent coronary artery occlusion find 50 % patient unstable coronary artery lesion 20 % ( 12 ) . In two series base autopsy , rate coronary artery lesion non-survivors SCD 80 % ( 13-15 ) . In study base autopsy non-survivors SCD , fresh thrombus find majority case . ( 2 ) Furthermore , noninflammatory plaque erosion find underlying cause thrombus formation 40 % case ( 14 ) . In case , thrombus form denuded endothelial plaque surface direct contact activate smooth muscle cell . In 211 patient non-complicated acute myocardial infarction cause acute coronary occlusion , SASKIA et al studied age intracoronary thrombus , aspirate angioplasty ( 16 ) . In least 50 % patient , thrombi day week old , thereby suggest ischemic pre-conditioning sub-group acute myocardial infarction patient ventricular arrhythmia . Maier et al study intra-coronary concentration select inflammatory biomarkers 42 patient acute myocardial infarction ( 17 ) . High level interleukin 6 serum amyloid A find occlusion site ; level even high patient previous clinical symptom acute myocardial infarction . These data suggest plaque erosion rupture follow intense local inflammation rapid thrombus formation . Our hypothesis speed thrombus formation coronary occlusion determines clinical symptom . Slow progressive thrombus formation likely induce myocardial pre-conditioning thereby reduce occurrence ventricular arrhythmia . In contrast , rapid thrombus formation follow acute coronary artery occlusion ischemia likely trigger fatal ventricular arrhythmia . We also believe precise determination endothelial cell apoptosis , plaque erosion , systemic local inflammation could shed light pathogenic mechanism prevail SCD due acute coronary artery occlusion . Protection thrombectomy device recently develop avoid distal embolisation angioplasty procedure saphenous vein graph angioplasty acute myocardial infarction . These device provide unique opportunity harvest blood thrombus site coronary occlusion . The aspirate use study speed intensity local thrombus formation . The use technique could extend patient SCD due acute coronary artery occlusion data compare patient acute myocardial infarction without ventricular arrhythmia . Furthermore , markers endothelial cell apoptosis , local systemic inflammatory biomarkers culprit coronary artery systemic blood could study patient also angioplasty procedure perform patient stable coronary lesion . ( 18-23 ) The aim TIDE study ( Thrombus Inflammation Sudden Death ) therefore compare composition age thrombus collect site coronary occlusion patient sudden death due acute coronary artery occlusion patient acute myocardial infarction without ventricular arrhythmia . The following hypothesis test : fresh thrombus frequent patient sudden cardiac death versus patient acute myocardial infarction without ventricular arrhythmia . Furthermore , coronary artery systemic blood sample draw group coronary angioplasty procedure patient stable angina pectoris determine role local systemic inflammation endothelial cell apoptosis setting .</detailed_description>
