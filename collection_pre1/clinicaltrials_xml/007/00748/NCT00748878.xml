	<brief_summary>Platelet transfusion routinely administer neonatal ECMO , average 1.3 platelet transfusion per day administer patient undergoing ECMO treatment . The cause thrombocytopenia ECMO largely involve platelet adherence oxygenator membrane . Platelet transfusion carry risk infection bacteria yeast , development worsen pulmonary hypertension . It likely few platelet transfusion administer ECMO run , cumulative adverse effect platelet transfusion would diminish patient outcome improve . In order well understand platelet function ECMO , investigator plan serially determine circulate platelet mass , plasma platelet factor 4 concentration , megakaryocyte mass ( estimate plasma thrombopoietin concentration ) , platelet function quantify PFA100 . Any patient ECMO eligible pilot study 5 patient . By understand change platelet function , hope design future study may modify frequency need platelet transfusion ECMO .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Platelet transfusion routinely administer neonatal ECMO , average 1.3 platelet transfusion per day administer patient undergo ECMO treatment.1 In general , platelet transfusion order patient ECMO platelet count fall 100,000/uL order prevent generalize hemorrhaging.1,2 The cause thrombocytopenia ECMO largely involve platelet adherence oxygenator membrane,3 mechanism also likely involved.4 Platelet transfusion carry risk well benefits.5 Infections bacteria yeast commonly report complication platelet transfusions,6,7 multiple platelet transfusion development worsen pulmonary hypertension may another common adverse effect.8,9 Pulmonary hypertension result administer biologically active pro-inflammatory protein ( know present platelet transfusion ) venous circulation . Of note , first capillary bed encounter within pulmonary circulation . It likely few platelet transfusion could safely administer ECMO run , cumulative adverse effect platelet transfusion would diminish thereby patient outcome might improve .</detailed_description>
