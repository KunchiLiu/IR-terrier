	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin decitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether carboplatin effective without decitabine treat patient ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study carboplatin decitabine see well work compare carboplatin alone treat patient progressive , advanced ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin With Without Decitabine Treating Patients With Progressive , Advanced Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare response rate patient progressive , advanced ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer methylated hMLH1 DNA plasma treat carboplatin v without decitabine . Secondary - To compare response rate patient ( regardless methylation status ) treat regimen . - To compare progression-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . - To compare safety tolerability regimen . - To determine feasibility combine decitabine carboplatin . - To determine incidence hypersensitivity reaction carboplatin . - To study relationship peak plasma level decitabine global CpG island specific methylation . - To study relationship global gene specific methylation peripheral blood mononuclear cell response . Tertiary - To correlate methylation status gene associate drug resistance detect plasma DNA response . - To determine sensitivity specificity methylation gene associate drug resistance detect plasma DNA predictor methylation status tumor cell isolate ascites tumor biopsy . - To study methylation expression gene tumor cell isolate ascites tumor biopsy treatment decitabine and/or carboplatin . - To investigate correlation methylation expression gene surrogate tissue , body fluid , tumor cell response progression-free survival . - To examine marker cell death plasma . - To compare methylation tumor take time presentation vs time treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior first-line treatment ( platinum alone vs platinum taxane v platinum combination ) , WHO performance status ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) , measurable disease criterion ( RECIST criterion vs CA-125 criterion v ) , participate center , number prior platinum-based regimen ( 1 vs 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive decitabine IV 6 hour day 1 carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 8 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacodynamic study . Samples assess methylation hMLH1 methylation-specific PCR ; global DNA methylation high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) ; methylation MAGE-1A gene promoter methylation-specific PCR bisulfite pyrosequencing ; marker apoptosis ELISA . Pharmacokinetic study decitabine also perform use blood sample patient randomize arm II . Ascitic fluid and/or tumor tissue sample may also collect pharmacodynamic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day every 2 month thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK .</detailed_description>
