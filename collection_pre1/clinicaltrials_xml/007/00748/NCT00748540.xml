	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation collect feasibility data assess safety efficacy Vibrant Soundbridge ( VSB ) , medical device design provide benefit aid hearing threshold , speech perception sound quality certain individual hear loss minimal change residual hearing . The VSB currently indicate adult moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss . Under present investigation , adult conductive mixed hearing loss successful user traditional amplification assess .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adults , 18 year age old time implantation English primary language Appropriate motivation expectation level Geographically physically able return investigational center schedule evaluation followup appointment . At least 28day unsuccessful hearing aid trial ( within past 24 month prior enrolment ) . Persons inform different hearing aid one currently may provide improved hearing , still request implant . Ability undergo general anesthesia Audiological test suggest either conductive mixed hearing loss . The nonimplanted ear may fall outside criterion ; however , threshold level may worse severe slop profound . Conductive Hearing Loss Puretone boneconduction threshold level ear implant shall fall within level state . There airbone gap 15 dB HL three frequency 500 , 1000 , 1500 , 2000 , 3000 , 4000 Hz . Puretone airconduction level indicate presence least moderate hearing loss least 41 dB HL . Air conduction level limit upper end .

There airbone gap 15 dB HL three frequency 500 , 1000 , 1500 , 2000 , 3000 , 4000 Hz . Bone conduction threshold least three frequency 26 dB great . Puretone airconduction threshold , average , least moderately impaired 41 dB great . Airconduction level limit upper end .

Hearing loss purely sensorineural origin Retrocochlear central auditory disorder Active middle ear infection Tympanic membrane perforation , ears previously reconstruct tympanic membrane may include Boneconduction threshold ear implant demonstrated recent fluctuation two frequency 15 dB either direction last 6 month , demonstrate serial audiogram . History postadolescent , innerear disorder , vertigo labyrinthitis Chronic nonrevisable vestibular balance disorder Middle ear infection responsive medical treatment Skin scalp condition may preclude attachment Audio Processor may interfere use Audio Processor Chronic pain around head Current previous use active hearing implant either ear . Any known physical , psychological , emotional disorder may interfere completion schedule followup evaluation Developmental delay organic brain dysfunction</criteria>
