	<brief_summary>Acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) frequent potentially life-threatening pulmonary illness . It complication sickle cell disease lead cause death disease adult . Several pathologic process recognize cause ACS , include infectious disease , hypoventilation secondary chest pain , situ thrombosis pulmonary fat embolism . Inhaled nitric oxide ( iNO ) show pulmonary vasodilatator minimal systemic effect also show improve gas exchange animal human acute lung injury ( ALI ) . The combined effect iNO gas improve pulmonary ventilation perfusion matching , reduce alveolar systemic inflammation , modulate course acute chest syndrome , combine physiopathology vaso-occlusive crisis acute lung injury . We hypothesise inhale NO improve oxygenation clinical outcome sickle cell disease patient acute chest syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : To compare outcome duration acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) patient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) treat iNO similar episode experience patient receive placebo . Study design : Bi-center , prospective , randomize , control clinical trial - Enrollment : 24 month - Patients treat 72 hour - Patients follow 15 day discharge home Sample size : - The study accrue maximum 240 patient - Progress trial review independent data safety monitoring committee determine randomization stop safety reason .</detailed_description>
