	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Calcium aluminosilicate anti-diarrheal ( CASAD ) may help treat prevent diarrhea cause irinotecan . It yet know whether CASAD effective placebo treat prevent diarrhea patient receive irinotecan . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study CASAD see well work compare placebo treat prevent diarrhea patient metastatic colorectal cancer receive irinotecan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcium Aluminosilicate Anti-Diarrheal Treating Preventing Diarrhea Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Receiving Irinotecan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare efficacy calcium aluminosilicate anti-diarrheal ( CASAD ) versus placebo reduce incidence grade 3 4 diarrhea patient metastatic colorectal cancer receive irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimen . Secondary - To compare stool per day patient treat drug . - To compare chemotherapy dose reduction delay due diarrhea patient treat drug . - To compare quality life patient treat drug . - To compare safety drug patient . - To compare incidence grade 3 4 diarrhea patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord chemotherapy regimen ( irinotecan hydrochloride combination fluorouracil and/or biologic therapy v irinotecan hydrochloride alone ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral calcium aluminosilicate anti-diarrheal ( CASAD ) 4 time daily 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients develop grade 3 4 diarrhea remove study may receive CASAD additional 6 week . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo 4 time daily 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients develop grade 3 4 diarrhea remove study may receive CASAD 6 week . Patients undergo quality-of-life assessment baseline week 3 , 5 , 6 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
