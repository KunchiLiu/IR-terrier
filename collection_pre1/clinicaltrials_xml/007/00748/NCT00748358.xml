	<detailed_description>- Antitumor efficacy sunitinib assess follow : - PSA response rate PSA progression accord Working Group Criteria , - Variation PSA doubling time ( PSADT ) initiation treatment , - Objective response rate ( ORR ) accord RECIST criterion , - Clinical benefit , - Overall survival ( OS ) . - Pharmacokinetic endpoint include sunitinib metabolite , SU012662 , plasma level estimation population pharmacokinetic parameter well inter-individual variability parameter , subgroup 30 patient . - The biological effect sunitinib patient metastatic prostate carcinoma evaluate measurement different biological marker could modulate antiangiogenic therapeutic , could predict monitor disease progression response treatment : - Bone tumor marker : bone resorption marker ( uCTX , uCTX , ICTP , CTX-MMP TRACP-5b ) , bone formation marker ( OC , PINP BALP ) , osteoclastogenesis marker ( OPG RANKL ) parameter calcium , phosphate , creatinine , albumin , PTH 25 ( OH ) D. - Angiogenesis marker : bFGF , SDF-1 , VEGF-A , VEGFR1 VEGFR2 , CECs CEPs , endothelial platelet microparticles .</detailed_description>
