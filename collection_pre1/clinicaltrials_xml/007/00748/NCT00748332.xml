	<detailed_description>Undernutrition frequent chronic heart failure ( approximately 40 % ) . Cardiac cachexia , main feature undernutrition , usually define weight loss 6 % 6 month , proven factor morbidity mortality disease . Its pathophysiology complex , proinflammatory cytokine seem play major role , thus appear close cancer cachexia . A number treatment proven effective prevent undernutrition chronic heart failure patient ( ß-blockers , ACE inhibitor , diuretic physical training ) . Omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acid , present fish oil , proven beneficial patient coronary heart disease , due part effect membrane also due anti-inflammatory effect , inhibition TNF-α interleukins 1 6 . However , study day conduct human cardiac cachexia . The aim phase III randomize control double-blinded study ass effect 8 week omega-3-enriched protein-energy supplement versus iso-energetic iso-nitrogenous supplement free omega-3 fatty acid cardiac cachexia . Thirty patient include group . The main judgment criterion maximum aerobic capacity ( VO2 max ) , best reflect aerobic capacity correlate muscle mass . Anthropometric , biological ( nutritional , inflammatory involve food intake control ) , cardiac ( functional ) quality life also study . All analysis perform intention treat . We expect significantly high improvement VO2 max omega-3 group . This study could lead therapeutic advance frequent severe disease .</detailed_description>
