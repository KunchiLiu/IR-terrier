	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety , tissue effect CryoSpray Ablation ( TM ) System ( CryoSpray Ablation ( TM ) , `` CSA '' `` cryospray therapy '' ) multiple center treat malignant airway disease lung use liquid nitrogen spray catheter via flexible fiber optic bronchoscopy ( FFB )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CryoSpray Ablation ( tm ) Malignant Airway Disease Determine Safety , Tissue Effect Lung ( ICE MAD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint efficacy cryogen tumor evaluate histopathological data visual inspection along visual confirmation absence scar stricturing airway . The primary safety endpoint report adverse event . The primary symptom measure St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) Borg Dyspnea Index ( BDI ) . The secondary endpoint consist measure treatment efficacy improvement luminal patency assess visual inspection . If initial repeat bronchoscopy , investigator determines immediate need intervention , future bronchoscopy perform upon subject presenting symptom . The propose study take place three center consist total 30 subject malignant airway obstruction . Treatment dosimetry 4 , 5-second spray cycle . Subjects initial cryospray treatment Day 0 . Subjects undergo repeat bronchoscopy first seven day initial treatment check mucosal slough reassess luminal patency airway . Subjects may undergo one bronchoscopy CSA therapy every seven day total four ( 4 ) treatment first month . If present symptom thereafter , repeat bronchoscopy perform ; luminal obstruction note , subject begin treatment protocol . Subjects may also rigid/flexible bronchoscopy laser electrocautery snare debulking tumor . If disease exist bilaterally , one side spray initially . The study population consist 30 subject malignant airway obstruction consequence endoluminal tumor obstructs portion respiratory tree vocal chord . These subject apprise Standard Care option , reject option deem ineligible . Subjects must sign consent form satisfy study inclusion exclusion criterion . It estimate enrollment take approximately 6 month . Each subject receive CryoSpray treatment course 1 year .</detailed_description>
