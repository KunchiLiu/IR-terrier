	<brief_summary>This research study examine health effect Iraq War , especially effect involve mental health . This study follow-up Neurocognition Deployment Health Study ( NDHS ) , also call `` Prospective Assessment Neurocognition Future Gulf-deployed Gulf-nondeployed Military Personnel : A Pilot Study . '' The specific purpose research study find longer lasting effect war mood stress symptom , think reaction skill , different aspect day day life , work daily activity . Survey test result previous participation NDHS compare new information obtain participant part study . The investigator expect total 817 military personnel military Veterans participate study . There two part study : ( 1 ) mail/internet/phone survey ( 2 ) in-person assessment . The investigator invite NDHS participant deploy Iraq participate survey component . The survey component study involve interview phone mood stress symptom head injury complete write survey question either mail internet address basic personal history ( age , military status , gender , combat injury history ) , mood , stress symptom , stressful experience . The phone interview take 2 2.5 hour complete . The questionnaire part take 20 30 minute complete , complete either mail back complete questionnaire internet use private , individual log-in/password combination . The investigator invite approximately 200 selected random large group survey responder take part in-person assessment . The in-person assessment involve take small subset neuropsychological task . The task give computer use paper pencil . Participants also ask complete questionnaire work , daily activity , health history , well basic health measure height , weight , blood pressure , heart rate , waist size . Potential participant give option complete in-person assessment one two study site ( Seattle Boston ) , private setting community ( e.g. , hotel small conference room ) .

	<brief_title>Neuropsychological Mental Outcomes Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) : A Longitudinal Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As August 2007 , approximately 1.5 million U.S. service member deploy either Iraq ( Operation Iraqi Freedom , OIF ) Afghanistan ( Operating Enduring Freedom , OEF ) . The sacrifice service member include &gt; 3500 fatality &gt; 35,000 injury result medical air transport . Medical sequela , involve traumatic amputation traumatic brain injury , common . Contemporary military operation also link significant adverse mental health consequence . In particular , recent evidence suggest overt psychiatric symptom functionally-relevant problem , attention memory impairment , occur . These adverse mental health consequence , already observe immediate aftermath war , could constitute significant public health problem prevalent persistent . In context , Cooperative Studies Program ( CSP ) study # 566 proposes observational cohort design examine war-related mental health dysfunction beyond immediate aftermath war . The propose work build unique data set available Neurocognition Deployment Health Study ( NDHS ) , interagency collaboration Department Defense ( DoD ) Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) . Initiated April 2003 , initial enrollment 1595 participant , NDHS focus short-term mental health outcome OIF deployment . To date , NDHS deployment health study U.S. troop include prospectively-gathered pre-deployment ( baseline ) post-deployment ( within 90 day return war ) data , well objective , performance-based measure mental functioning . The proposed work would collect new `` long-term follow-up '' data 3 5 year NDHS participant return initial deployment Iraq . The newly acquire data propose work analyze data available previous wave NDHS . The two primary objective CSP # 566 : ( 1 ) determine prevalence course posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) among Iraq War Veterans 3-5 year follow return Iraq War deployment ; ( 2 ) ass persistence previously observe neuropsychological change ( attention , verbal learning , visual memory , reaction time ) follow war-zone participation relationship subsequent development PTSD end-point . The second primary objective also evaluate traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) possible neural risk factor PTSD . The two secondary objective : ( 1 ) examine association risk resilience factor , include impact war zone stressor , outcome PTSD , major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , panic disorder ; ( 2 ) determine whether change PTSD symptom neuropsychological function associate subsequent day-to-day functioning , include health-related functional activity occupational functioning . The propose study include two hierarchical participant sample frame : ( 1 ) `` full sample '' ( N=817 ) examination PTSD related outcome ; ( 2 ) `` neuropsychological subsample '' ( N=200 ) examination neuropsychological functional outcome . Both sample draw anticipated 1149 participant original NDHS cohort deploy Iraq consent contacted future research . The `` full sample '' component include clinician-administered structured psychiatric phone interview determine clinically significant case PTSD , major depressive disorder , panic disorder ; mail questionnaire survey provide assessment posttraumatic stress ( PTS ) symptom severity . The `` neuropsychological sample '' component include in-person performance-based assessment neuropsychological outcome , show previously affect deployment Iraq . In addition , participant neuropsychological sample complete questionnaire relevant health-related functional impact occupational functioning . The planned duration study 5.5 year , include 6 month start-up period , 42 month locate , contact , complete assessment participant , 6 month lock close database , 12 month complete primary secondary analysis . The attribute establish study population , combination scope propose work , offer unique opportunity answer scientific question direct relevance healthcare policy return OIF Veterans . Specifically , study 1 ) identify quantifiable objective measure associate subsequent outcome functioning , 2 ) determine early potentially modifiable factor may use promote resilience , 3 ) optimize treatment `` window , '' 4 ) help project future resource allocation base frequency impact mental health problem identify .</detailed_description>
