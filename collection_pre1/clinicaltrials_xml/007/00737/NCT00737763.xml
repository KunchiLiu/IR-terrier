	<brief_title>Beta Cell Rescue New Onset Type 1 Diabetes With Efalizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since data show early intervention prevent destruction insulin produce beta cell , patient enrol study diagnose Type 1 diabetes within 6 week enrol start therapy . Patients meet screen criterion randomize 2 1 ratio either get weekly subcutaneous injection efalizumab 26 week versus placebo injection . The researcher patient blind treatment group assignment . All patient follow two year . The primary endpoint study difference baseline body 's ability respond Mixed Meal Tolerance Test 12 month enrollment . The Mixed Meal Tolerance test help test production insulin pancreas . By compare result test treat group placebo group , hope able show preservation beta cell function group treat efalizumab .</detailed_description>
