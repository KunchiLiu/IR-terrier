	<brief_title>Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing Preoperative Risk Stratification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year 20000 UK patient die within 30 day surgery . It seem UK patient 's chance become seriously unwell die follow surgery higher comparable country . Fewer bed UK give Intensive Care country . Closer attention care give operation , achieve intensive care unit ( ICU ) , almost certainly reduce chance serious illness follow major surgery . An increase number intensive care unit bed UK extremely unlikely . Better use available intensive care bed could achieve allocate believe improve outcome ( follow surgery ) allocating patient likely benefit . Tests use ass risk surgery patient largely ineffective . Cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPX ) seem effective identifying patient risk death serious illness post surgery . This information use study select patient ICU bed reduce death . The study far limitation design scope mean ca n't certain approach work UK . We suggest study answer question conclusively specifically UK patient . We randomly divide patient two group . In 1st group choice postoperative care environment base best current practice group make decision ( critical care ward ) base result CPX . We hope benefit include less patient become seriously ill die shorter stay hospital surgery follow major operation . We also hope information help patient understand risk operation well therefore make good inform decision . This may also reduce overall cost surgery hospital .</detailed_description>
