	<criteria>Signed , informed consent . Age &gt; 18 year Histologically cytologically document locally advanced metastatic solid tumour refractory standard therapy standard therapy exists . Patients recover acute adverse effect prior therapy ( exclude alopecia ) . Adequate bone marrow , hepatic renal function include follow : Hb &gt; 9g/dl ( transfusion independent ) &gt; 10g/dl ( transfusion permit ) , absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L , platelet ≥ 100 x 109/L ; Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper normal limit ; AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x upper normal limit Creatinine ≤1.5 x upper normal limit . Performance status ( PS ) ≤ 2 ( ECOG scale ) . Estimated lifeexpectancy great 3 month . Female patient reproductive potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior start trial . Both woman men must agree use medically acceptable method contraception throughout treatment period 3 month discontinuation treatment . Anticancer therapy include chemotherapy , radiotherapy , endocrine therapy , immunotherapy use investigational agent within 4 week prior first dose medication trial within long period , depend define characteristic agent e.g . 6 week nitrosurea mitomycin . Bisphosphonates bone disease permit provided dos stable trial . Coexisting active infection serious concurrent illness . Significant cardiovascular disease define : history congestive heart failure require therapy ; history unstable angina pectoris myocardial infarction 6 month prior trial entry ; presence severe valvular heart disease ; presence ventricular arrhythmia require treatment . Any coexist medical condition investigator 's judgement substantially increase risk associate patient 's participation study . Psychiatric disorder alter mental status preclude understand informed consent process and/or completion necessary study . Gastrointestinal disorder may interfere absorption study drug . Persistent grade II great toxicity cause . Patients know brain tumour metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurological dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event .
