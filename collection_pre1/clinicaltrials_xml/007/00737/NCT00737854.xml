	<brief_summary>Oral lichen planus common chronic mucocutaneous disease various clinical form . Erosive-ulcerative form usually cause symptom pain discomfort . The important complication OLP development oral squamous cell carcinoma , although controversial matter . various treatment suggest OLP result unsatisfactory . Through experience investigator , corticosteroid ( form ) wise option treat OLP many side effect . More , immunosuppressive therapy influence risk oral cancer . The purpose study determine efficacy free soft tissue graft treatment precancerous symptomatic lesion OLP . Removal lesion submucosa do . The graft slice healthy mucosa also submucosa . Then graft suture position . According author , basal epithelial layer graft remain intact represent focus re-epithelization . New epithelial cell migrate basal membrane appear guide proliferation , generate new epithelium . The wound re-epithelialized proliferation surround healthy epithelial cell , therefore , contaminate modify antigen cell membrane theoretically responsible lymphocyte aggression . The healthy graft remain free lesion appear clinically healthy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oral lesion OLP chronic , rarely undergo spontaneous remission , potentially premalignant often source morbidity . recent study support non reticular OLP predispose malignant change . Moreover , immunosuppressive therapy influence risk oral cancer . general , treatment aim eliminate precancerous lesion , alleviate symptom , potentially decrease risk malignant transformation . Although cause OLP unknown , generally consider immunologically mediated process microscopically resemble hypersensitivity reaction .it characterize intense T cell infiltrate localize epithelium-connective tissue interface . purpose study determine efficacy free soft tissue graft treatment precancerous symptomatic lesion OLP . removal lesion submucosa do . graft slice healthy mucosa also submucosa . graft suture position . According author , basal epithelial layer graft remain intact represent focus reepithelialization . new epithelial cell migrate basal membrane appear guide proliferation , generate new epithelium . wound re-epithelialized proliferation surround healthy epithelial cell , therefore , contaminate modify antigen cell membrane theoretically responsible lymphocyte aggression healthy graft remain free lesion appear clinically healthy .</detailed_description>
