	<brief_summary>The study conduct Matlab Health Demographic Surveillance System ( HDSS ) field area International Centre Diarrhoeal Disease Research , Bangladesh ( ICDDR , B ) determine population effectiveness Rotarix Bangladeshi child . Villages intervention government comparison area include evaluation . We propose introduce Rotarix half village Matlab HDSS . In village randomize receive vaccine , eligible child offer Rotarix first two Expanded Programme Immunization ( EPI ) visit , would routinely do Rotarix include Government EPI schedule . In village randomize receive Rotarix , child receive EPI vaccination exactly would absence study . Administration Rotarix conduct regular EPI staff , ICDDR , B study staff present document inform consent collect study-specific information . The Ministry Health active partner evaluation since agency may follow subsequent vaccine programme . Vaccination Rotarix record infant 's immunization card normally use EPI programme , also separate study-specific data collection form . Vaccination Rotarix continue study initiation June 30 , 2011 . Surveillance rotavirus gastroenteritis occur Matlab Diarrhoeal Hospital community treatment centre Matlab HDSS continuously throughout study period . Diarrheal illness information collect surveillance link Rotarix study-specific data subject 's HDSS identification number . The primary study endpoint occurrence illness episode acute diarrhoea , among infant child admit medical facility , determine cause wild-type rotavirus find stool specimen . At end surveillance period , rate primary study endpoint among age-eligible infant compare village randomize receive Rotarix versus village randomize receive Rotarix . We expect rate rotavirus diarrhoea significantly low among child vaccinate village . The first participant enrol study September 23 , 2008 . Till date ( May 12 , 2010 ) total 2,882 participant enrol receive first dose . 2,684 participant receive second dose Rotarix . There 1013 case gastroentritis report diarrhoeal treatment centre among &lt; 2 year old child vaccinate unvaccinated village . There six death case among child receive Rotarix vaccine . These death case relate vaccines/study product .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial determine population effectiveness Rotarix Bangladeshi infant . The study conduct government comparison area intervention area Matlab HDSS . To carry evaluation , introduce Rotarix vaccine half village HDSS area . In village randomize receive Rotarix , study explain parent consent child 's participation child eligible , child receive two dos Rotarix first two EPI visit ( schedule 6 10 week age ) , possible , would routinely do Rotarix include government programme . Administration Rotarix conduct regular EPI staff , ICDDR , B study staff present document inform consent collect study-specific information . Vaccination Rotarix record infant 's immunization card normally use EPI programme , also separate study-specific data collection form . Participation study affect subject 's receipt routine childhood immunization medical care . In village randomize receive Rotarix , child receive EPI vaccination exactly would absence study . Surveillance conduct Matlab Diarrhoeal Hospital two community treatment centre Nayergaon Kalirbazaar , facilitate quick easy accessibility treatment life-threatening diarrhoeal disease HDSS area . The main study outcome episode rotavirus diarrhoea among child admit Matlab Diarrhoeal Hospital either two community treatment centre ( Nayergaon Kalirbazaar ) . Study personnel record child 's symptoms clinical history , collect fecal specimen laboratory test rotavirus . The identity child confirm HDSS subject identification number system . All patient come Matlab Diarrhoea Hospital Nayergoan community treatment centre village already include Matlab diarrhoea surveillance system , faecal sample routinely test rotavirus pathogen , result link demographic health database HDSS . Kalirbazaar treatment centre currently include current surveillance system , establish surveillance centre study . For enrolled participant present one treatment facility , illness information test result link HDSS demographic data study-specific data collect enrolment subject 's HDSS number . For resident enrolled present treatment facility , illness information link HDSS demographic data , already do part surveillance activity . Rates acute gastroenteritis cause rotavirus agent among age-eligible infant compare infant ( vaccinate unvaccinated ) village randomize receive Rotarix versus ( unvaccinated ) village randomize receive Rotarix . We expect rate diarrhoea significantly low among child vaccinate village , rate diarrhoea cause pathogen may similar . ( This second analysis - `` control analysis '' - helpful verify lack bias health seek behaviour since one would expect cholera , ETEC , Salmonella Shigella gastroenteritis rate would similar two groups. ) . These case detect patient age come Matlab Diarrhoeal Hospital community treatment centre ( Nayergaon Kalirbazaar ) , primary analysis include rotavirus diarrhoea case among child age-eligible vaccination respective village . Although blinded evaluation , introduction bias reduce several way . First , vaccine team locate EPI centre completely separate clinical setting clinician conduct surveillance . Second , clinician separate scientist conduct laboratory test . Third , laboratory assay rotavirus carried laboratory Dhaka use cod specimen conducted time illness ( since little clinical value ) . Although parent could inform clinician his/her child 's participation study , believe unlikely important source bias two reason . One , rotavirus gastroenteritis see later 6 month infant 's second dose Rotarix , active follow-up among parent last receipt Rotarix . Thus , reduce likelihood parent remember child receive vaccination target specifically one type severe diarrhoea . Second , Matlab Diarrhoeal Hospital community treatment centre care severe diarrhoea many year entire community already accustom attend facility illness . Thus , reduce likelihood parent vaccinate unvaccinated infant go differential diarrhoeal illness treatment-seeking behavior . Again , study conduct government comparison area intervention area Matlab HDSS . Enrolment begin government comparison area later June 1 , 2008 . Enrolment begin intervention area January 1 , 2009 . Surveillance rotavirus diarrhoea occur continuously concurrently enrolment activity . Enrolment area cease June 30 , 2010 , surveillance rotavirus gastroenteritis occur December 31 , 2010 . By January 1 , 2009 , expect less 15 % child le 2 year age intervention area receive Rotateq Merck trial . Nonetheless , stratify randomization within intervention area rate participation trial village . Additionally , full dataset Matlab Rotateq trial , able analyze impact Rotateq trial Rotarix evaluation within intervention area .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A male female infant least 6 week age old 20 week age time first dose Rotarix .
