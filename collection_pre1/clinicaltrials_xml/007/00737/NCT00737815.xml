	<brief_summary>The investigator recent epidemiologic work several national survey cohort men woman show dietary pattern high plant-based food phytochemical associate low plasma level insulin , triglyceride , C-reactive protein , reduce risk type 2 DM CHD . While physiologic impact different food serum glucose insulin critical importance , extent specific dietary nutrient modify insulin resistance well understood . Magnesium biologically active constituent whole-grain , green leafy vegetable , nut appear play essential role hundred physiologic process human . However , remain uncertain whether magnesium intake exert effect insulin sensitivity inflammation . Moreover , little known extent magnesium intake elicits change expression level key gene responsible glucose homeostasis systemic inflammation . The ultimate clinical question whether magnesium supplementation would clinically effective improvement metabolic disorder yet diabetic high-risk individual , especially susceptible insulin resistance . Therefore , direct follow previous work study health benefit plant-based food whole grain , fruit vegetable , propose pilot randomize trial unravel metabolic anti-inflammatory effect magnesium supplementation versus placebo among overweight individual metabolic syndrome particularly prone adverse effect magnesium deficiency . Recent advancement molecular genetics genomic technology also enable u analyze expression level thousand gene simultaneously different experimental condition . The application high throughput microarray technology randomized-controlled set analyzed novel statistical method , help understand nutrient-disease relation , also afford investigator opportunity gain important insight molecular mechanism complex biological system inflammation , insulin resistance , metabolic abnormality response nutrition intervention .</brief_summary>
