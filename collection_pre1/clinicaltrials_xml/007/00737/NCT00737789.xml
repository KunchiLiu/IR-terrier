	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate mesalazine 4g orally per day daily ( QD ) non-inferior reference regimen , mesalazine 4g per day two divide dos ( BID ) ( 2g x 2 per day ) , patient active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) treat 8 week , term remission evaluate Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index ( UC-DAI ) score define less equal 1 . Both group ( 4g QD 2gx2 ) receive enema contain 1g mesalazine bedtime initial 4 week . Participants remission week 8 receive additional 4 week maintenance therapy 2g oral mesalazine day . Participants achieve remission Week 8 complete study week 8 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mesalazine 4g Once Daily Versus 4g Two Divided Doses Active Ulcerative Colitis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A key element therapeutic response UC treatment compliance . In daily practice , compliance UC patient 5-Amino Salicylic Acid ( 5-ASA ) treatment appear mediocre , particularly maintenance therapy . Poor non-existent compliance affect treatment response also disease progression . An inverse relationship find number daily dose prescribe treatment compliance . Thus , reduction single daily dose mesalazine major factor likely significantly increase treatment compliance . Reducing dose rate single daily dose 8 week constitute simple method improve treatment compliance necessary demonstrate least equivalent efficacy compare twice daily dose reference regimen . This study design show mesalazine 4g daily least effective mesalazine 4g two divided dos per day patient mild moderate ulcerative colitis 8 week treatment good compliance . To improve remission , group receive enema first 4 week , usually do current practice .</detailed_description>
