	<brief_title>Properties Clinical Performance Zirconia-based Dental Ceramics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Zirconia use dentistry since 2000 construct fix partial denture . Its advantage high fracture resistance , excellent biocompatibility , moderate opacity , etc . Because increase demand esthetic restoration , zirconia becomes popular use core material all-ceramic system . Its property investigate extensively many vitro study . However , clinical performance zirconia-based restoration would require period time result assess . Currently , much result regard clinical performance zirconia-based prosthesis information require future research .</detailed_description>
