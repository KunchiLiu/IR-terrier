	<brief_summary>This study examine hormone function men osteoarthritis pain affected opioid medication ( Percocet , Vicodin , MS Contin morphine ) versus placebo . Men 30 65 year age moderate severe osteoarthritis joint pain least 5 day week past 3 month may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination , x-rays , laboratory test , questionnaire pain , mood medical health . They give pain diary complete 2 week . Participants admit hospital two 12 hour overnight stay , provide 24-hour urine collection small blood sample drawn every 20 minute 12 hour ( 8:00 p.m. 8:00 a.m. ) catheter remain place vein . Blood pressure pulse monitor time . After catheter remove , subject complete questionnaire pain , mood activity . For several week two hospitalization , subject take either opioid medication placebo , standard medication motrin naprosyn , accord random assignment one three group . All participant allow take anti-inflammatory medication acetaminophen time need , pain medication treatment . They monitor two three time week telephone complete pain diary . After second hospitalization , subject taper study medication . After 2 4 week stop medication , return final outpatient visit review pain medical problem blood drawn .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormone Function Men Treated Pain With Opioids Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use opioid medicine relief chronic pain increase substantially opioidergic medication chronic pain show perturb neuroendocrine function . The objective protocol : To determine whether long term opioid usage men chronic pain due osteoarthritis result abnormality Adrenocorticotropic Hormone ( ACTH ) , cortisol , Luteinizing Hormone ( LH ) testosterone secretion . This protocol revise continuation two phase protocol name initiate NCCAM 2004 . In first phase study 12 opioid na ( SqrRoot ) men chronic OA pain compare to12 healthy men mean 12 hour overnight frequent blood sample measurement baseline ACTH , cortisol , LH testosterone . The result phase 1 suggest chronic osteoarthritis pain affect ACTH , cortisol , LH testosterone secretion middle age men compare match control . In second phase NCCAM protocol intend evaluate effect long term opioid usage AND placebo effect any- hormone men chronic OA pain . Therefore NCCAM study three arm design compare MS Contin placebo standard treatment . When protocol revise NINR , review placebo literature suggest placebo effect become negligible time therefore two arm design choose compare morphine placebo . Baseline overnight blood hormone sampling , dose medication , escalation taper schedule phase II NCCAM protocol . Because design change sample size however recalculate total 30 opioid na ( SqrRoot ) patient chronic OA pain . Fourteen patient , previously recruit NCCAM , randomize either morphine placebo finish study . Therefore 16 additional patient need complete study . Taking consideration 25 % drop rate therefore total 20 patient need recruit . After undergo overnight baseline hormone sample patient randomize one two treatment group : MS Contin ( 15-90 mg ) , placebo Doses placebo MS Contin escalate 4-8 week similar fashion follow two-week maintenance period . At point patient return repeat 12 hour frequent sample hormone baseline . They taper study medication period 2-4 week outpatient . Subjects return clinic final visit , AM blood obtain ACTH , cortisol , LH , testosterone . The primary endpoint study measure ACTH , cortisol , LH , testosterone secretion , whereas secondary endpoint neurobehavioral index pain symptomatology 0-10 ( Likert ) scale , Oswestry Disability Index , Multidimensional Pain Inventory , Beck Depression Inventory . It anticipate result second phase study provide novel information regard effect treatment opioids select neuroendocrine function men .</detailed_description>

Impaired pulmonary , renal , hepatic , cardiovascular endocrinemetabolic function major coexist medical condition cancer , Cushing disease , diabetes may make participation unsafe interfere hormone measurement 2 . Prostatic disease hypertrophy would make subject prone urinary retention require medication would interfere study hormone measurement 3 . Sexual dysfunction include lack libido , impotence erectile abnormality safety reason symptom may worsen morphine 4 . Rheumatoid arthritis type inflammatory arthritis 5 . Use systemic corticosteroid two month study entry might interfere study hormone measurement 6 . Present past history alcohol dependence might predispose subject problem opioid dependence base 2 positive response CAGE questionnaire ( latter group refer psychiatry evaluation exclude study find fulfill psychiatric criterion alcohol dependence abuse ) 7 . Current usage recreational unauthorized prescription drug may indicate abuse potential base positive urine drug test study screen visit 8 . History opioid abuse time past base patient report urine drug screen positive opioids 9 . Major depression base score great equal 20 Beck Depression Inventory screening , present history major depression treatment major depression may effect endocrine function 10 . Hct &lt; 35 ; anemia bleed disorder subject undergo serial blood sample assess hormone function 11 . Allergy inability tolerate morphine 12 . Current past fibromyalgia accord Wolfe criterion ( 1990 ) 13 . Present past history sleep apnea increase risk respiratory depression morphine 14 .
