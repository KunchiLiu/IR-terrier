	<brief_title>Clinical Outcome Study Minimally Invasive Decompression Lumbar Spinal Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient undergoing microendoscopic decompressive laminotomy ( MEDL ) lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS ) enrol prospective study . The patient include must fulfill follow selection criterion : - neurogenic claudication radicular leg pain associate neurologic sign refer LSS syndrome ; - moderate severe spinal canal stenosis show cross-sectional imaging MRI CT scan ; - failure conservative treatment least three month . The patient present either mechanical low back pain segmental instability . Mechanical low back pain define pain induced posture change , prevents patient sit stand 30 minute . Patients consider segmental instability isthmic spondylolisthesis , degenerative spondylolisthesis 4 mm translation intervertebral angle reversal dynamic radiographs.18 Surgical technique All surgical procedure perform single surgeon ( J. P. ) . The patient position prone Relton-Hall frame general anesthesia . Decompression do endoscope tubular retraction system METRx ( Medtronics , Minneapolis , MN ) . For patient unilateral neurological symptom , perform unilateral laminotomy foraminotomy . For patient bilateral neurological symptom , performe unilateral laminotomy bilateral decompression ( ULBD ) decompress central canal bilateral lateral recess . When perform multiple-level decompression , skin incision center midpoint select intervertebral disc level . The incision mobilize one level release underlying connective tissue . Then set tubular retractor system separate muscular portal level . For patient small stature , perform three-level surgery single surgical wound , size perform single-level surgery . All patient routine AP , lateral , dynamic lateral radiograph pre-operatively , six month surgery , final follow-up . Post-operative instability define progression listhesis scoliosis dynamic radiograph . Every patient MR image lumbar spine surgery . The severity stenosis classify accord cross sectional area dura sac axial plane T1-weighted MR images—severe stenosis le 76 mm2 , moderate stenosis 76 100 mm2 , mild stenosis 100 mm2 . When MRI contraindicate , CT-myelography use instead . Outcomes assessment do Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) overall disability Japanese Orthopedic Association ( JOA ) score clinical symptom sign . The patient receive evaluation surgery , six month , final follow-up examination . The range ODI 100 ~ 0 low index correspond good result . Significant improvement define 15 point improvement treatment . The range JOA score -3 ~ 29 high score correspond good result . The improvement rate base JOA score calculate follow : ( pre-operative score - post-operative score ) / ( 29 - pre-operative score ) × 100 % . The clinical result classify four grade improvement rate : excellent ( 75 % ) , good ( 51 % 75 % ) , fair ( 26 % 50 % ) , poor ( less 26 % ) . The success treatment define 25 % improvement rate JOA score.20 At final follow-up , inquire patient satisfied treatment result . The data pre-operative comorbidities , intra-operative , peri-operative , post-operative complication retrieve medical chart review . Distribution gender , age , clinical characteristic ( coexistence spondylolisthesis scoliosis , severity stenosis , level decompression ) , self-assessed satisfaction binary outcome treatment ( success , base JOA score ; significant improvement , base ODI ) tabulate . Fisher exact test preform compare difference two group . Odds ratio calculate use univariate logistic regression . Variables two-sided p-value le 0.05 consider significant factor associate successful treatment . All statistical analysis perform statistical software , SAS version 9.1 ( SAS Institute Inc , Cary , NC ) .</detailed_description>
