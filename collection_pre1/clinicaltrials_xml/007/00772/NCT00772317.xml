	<brief_title>A Multicenter Clinical Study Sonablate®450 TreAtment Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer With HIFU ( STAR Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study non-randomized , prospective , single arm study . The safety effectiveness Sonablate treatment subject locally recurrent prostate cancer evaluate regard freedom biochemical failure disease recurrence follow HIFU treatment . Men histologically confirm , locally recurrent , organ-confined , non-metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma two year follow EBRT , PSA ≥0.5 ng/mL ≤10 ng/mL , 40 85 year age , initial stag T1c-T2 prior radiation , meet criteria salvage treatment , enrol . This pivotal study cover pre-treatment 12-month post-treatment follow-up visit ( 8 visit ) . A 5 year extend follow-up study conduct annually 2nd-5th year post treatment ( 4 additional visit ) .</detailed_description>
