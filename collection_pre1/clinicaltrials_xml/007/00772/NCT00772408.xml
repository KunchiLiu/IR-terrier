	<detailed_description>Infection Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( TB ) remain epidemic level globally . One third word 's population infect organism , make tuberculosis prevalent infectious disease . Annually , 8 million people contract disease , 2 million death worldwide year , increase prevalence predict next several decade . ( 1 ) In Taiwan , 24,161 reporting case register national tuberculosis database , 17,660 diagnose confirm TB case 2004 . The annual incidence rate newly TB case 74.11 per 100,000 people . Immunity Against Mycobacteria M. tuberculosis unique pathogen infection occur , even face intact host immune system eradicate establishes chronically persistent , latent , state . Viable organism remain sequestered host 's immune system , though fail progressively replicate . Subsequently , approximately 15 % latently infect , infection may reactivate development overt , progressive , pulmonary disease . Impairments immune system may link reactivation , much remain discover control infection M. tuberculosis . Innate adaptive immune response evolve protective mechanism infectious organism human . Phagocytosis relatively small number organisms initiate host response alveolar cells.CD14 toll-like receptor ( TLRs ) examples pattern recognition receptor detect antigenic molecule surface bacteria mycobacteria . ( 2 ) The family TLRs capable recognize conserve microbial pattern include component bacterial cell wall , microbial nucleic acid , bacterial motility . TLRs first defense system detect potential pathogen , initiate immune response form crucial link innate adaptive immune system . TLRs also play import role pathophysiology infectious disease , inflammatory disease Crohn 's disease atherosclerosis , possibly play role autoimmune disease . ( 3 ) TLRs transmembrane protein characterize extracellular leucine-rich domain participates ligand recognition intracellular tail contains conserve region call Toll interleukin 1 receptor ( IL-1R ) homology domain . ( 4 ) Stimulation TLR initiate signal cascade involves number protein , MyD88 IL-1 receptor-associated kinase . ( 5 ) This signal cascade lead NF-κB activation , induce secretion pro-inflammatory cytokine . TLR2 report principle mediator macrophage activation response mycobacteria . TLR2 expression find primarily alveolar macrophage epithelial cell type Ⅱwithin tuberculous granuloma . Due ability recognize Mycobacterium tuberculosis component , expression TLR2 site disease critical . ( 6 , 7 ) Single nucleotide polymorphisms Toll-like receptor susceptibility pulmonary tuberculosis Growing amount data suggest ability certain individual respond properly TLR ligands may impair single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) within TLR gene , result altered susceptibility , course , infectious disease.TLR2 member TLR family . ( 8 ) Animal study show TLR2-knockout mouse susceptible septicemia due Staphylococcus Listeria monocytogenes , meningitis due Streptococcus pneumoniae , infection Mycobacterium tuberculosis , suggest functional TLR2 polymorphism may impair host response certain spectrum microbial pathogen . ( 9 ) Mycobacterium tuberculosis infect 2 billion people globally , yet 10 % develop clinical disease . The identification factor predispose disease could aid development new therapy vaccine . The genetic polymorphism TLR2 ( arginine glutamine substitution residue 753 ( Arg753Gln ) ) associate negative influence TLR2 function , may , turn , determine innate host response mycobacteria . In recent cohort study , polymorphism demonstrate influence risk develop tuberculosis Turkey patient . ( 10 ) In addition , another polymorphism ( Arg677Trp ) TLR2 report associated susceptibility tuberculosis Tunisian patient ( 11 ) , well lepromatous leprosy ( 12 ) . More recently , polymorphisms CD 14 TLR2 demonstrate associate increased prevalence infection critical ill adult ( 13 ) . TLR2 gene Arg753Lin polymorphism also strongly associate rheumatic fever child . Moreover , polymorphism risk factor coronary restenosis . ( 14 ) Dynamics cytokine generation inflammatory cell clinical outcome TLRs mediate activation cell innate immune system lead dynamic function include direct anti-microbial activity , induction cytokine secretion , trigger dendritic cell maturation , trigger apoptosis . Macrophage phagocytosis M. tuberculosis accompany activation transcription factor NF-κB secretion inflammatory mediator play important role granuloma formation immune protection . Once antigen-presenting cell ( alveolar macrophage dendritic cell ) process engulfed mycobacterial protein , present antigen context major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class Ⅱ surface molecule naïve CD4+ lymphocyte . The antigen-presenting cell produce IL-12 bias immune reaction T helper 1 ( Th1 ) IL-1 , stimulate CD4+ lymphocytes produce IL-2 . The net result rapid clonal expansion specific CD4+ Th1 lymphocyte , produce interferon gamma ( IFNγ ) , cytokine activate macrophage engulf mycobacteria become mycobactericidal . It demonstrate 19-kDa lipoprotein M.tb trigger cell activate NF-κB secret IL-2 TLR-2 dependent pathway ( 15 ) .On hand , The Th2 cytokine may play role mycobacterial inflammation well . IL-10 , produce monocyte , macrophage , lymphocytes , upregulated mycobacterail infection , downregulates IFN-γ production . Secretion IL-10 favor activation Th2 response incapable destroy intracellular pathogen . Activation human monocyte derive dendritic cell M.tb 19 kDa lipoprotein result preferential secretion IL-12 IL-10 ( 16 , 17 ) . The balance IFN-γ IL-10 production may determine wheather effective immunity establish anergy supervenes infect patient , may influence clinical outcome . Levels IFN-γ high moderate disease advance dias , whereas advance case show high IL-12 , TNF-alpha compare case moderate TB . In patient , decrease interferon-γ production PBMC seem transient response significantly increase active TB patient follow successful therapy . In TB patient systemic reaction , IL-12 IFN-γproduction monocyte challenge virulent M.tb strain significantly reduce compare PPD reactor group . Bronchoalveolar lavarge fluid level IFN-γ also correlate disease grade decrease anti-TB chemotherapy ( 18 ) .However , patient remain anergic vivo vitro chemotherapy , underlie biochemical mechanism T cell anergy modulate protection pathology TB need clarification . ( 19 ) Toll-like receptor 2 mutation profile cytokines The production IL-6 IL-10 dendritic cell response M.tuberculosis principally dependent TLR2 ( 20 ) . On hand , M. tuberculosis induce IL-12 production absence either TLR2 TLR4 . In leprosy patient TLR2 mutation ( Arg677Trp ) , production IL-2 , IL-12 , IFN-gamma , TNF-alpha M. leprae-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell decrease compare group wild-type TLR2 . However cell patient TLR2 mutation show significantly increase production IL-10 . These result suggest TLR2 signal pathway play critical role alteration cytokine profile PBMC patient mycobacterial infection . ( 21 ) In summary , TLR2 polymorphisms show associated susceptibility tuberculosis Turkey Tunisian people . These polymorphism demonstrate affect cytokine production monocytes vitro . To date , study association SNPs TLR2 serum cytokine profile clinical outcome M. tuberculosis infection . We hypothesize polymorphisms TLR2 associate : 1. increase prevalence active pulmonary TB infection , 2. altered level pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine serum , 3. clinical outcome presentation . We thus design prospective case control study test hypothesis . The frequency TLR2 polymorphisms pulmonary TB patient healthy control determine compare polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism . Serial serum level IL-12 , IFN-γ , IL-10 pulmonary TB patient without TLR2 polymorphism measure enzyme link immunosorbent assay initial presentation , 2months 6 month anti-TB drug treatment . Relationships TLR2 polymorphism serum cytokine dynamic clinical outcome analyze .</detailed_description>
