	<brief_title>Lenalidomide With Without Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess progression-free survival 1 year patient newly diagnose symptomatic multiple myeloma treat lenalidomide alone combination dexamethasone add disease progression lack partial response . Secondary - To assess response rate regimen patient . - To assess toxicity regimen patient . Tertiary - To examine effect lenalidomide alone tumor specific immunity global parameter immune function . - To examine effect dexamethasone addition patient require steroid . - To correlate change parameter immune response measure disease response . - To examine antiangiogenic activity lenalidomide alone combination dexamethasone . - To examine effect lenalidomide alone tumor cell survival proliferation . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 18 course absence second disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning course 4 , patient experience stable progressive disease also receive concurrent oral dexamethasone daily day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 subsequent course . Blood bone marrow sample collect periodically pharmacological correlative study . Samples analyze parameter immune activation , cell proliferation apoptosis , circulate tumor cell endothelial cell via flow cytometry ; global impact therapy immune cell subset via immunophenotype analysis ; angiogenesis via CD34 stain . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
