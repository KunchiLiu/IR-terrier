	<brief_summary>Glutamine , non essential branch chain amino acid , important non toxic nitrogen carrier body . It participate variety physiological function . It major fuel source enterocytes substrate gluconeogenesis kidney , lymphocytes , monocyte . It also nutrient muscle protein metabolism response infection , inflammation muscle trauma . The significance glutamine metabolic homeostasis become evident period stress , become conditionally essential amino acid . Role glutamine protective agent hepato-biliary dysfunction , maintain mucosal integrity Gastrointestinal tract follow administration patient major bowel surgery supplement part TPN critically ill patient patient septicemia , well establish . However role glutamine supplementation reduce prevent chemotherapeutic agent induced toxicity cancer patient controversial .</brief_summary>
