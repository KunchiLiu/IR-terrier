	<detailed_description>13.3 Study design protocol 13.3.1 Design : double-blind case-control cross-over study 13.3.2 Patients inclusion / exclusion criterion : The study consist 12-16 patient main study ( see main protocol ) select follow criterion - Abnormal right ventricular pressure response exercise ( cut-off 45 mmHg maximal RVSP exercise ) - Informed consent participation include use sildenafil / placebo . The patient approximately one year old initial study . 13.3.3 Examination protocol The patient examine similarly twice least 12 hour one night sleep activity ensure drug washout . One hour study part , pharmacy produce capsule ( envelope cod drawn random manner box ) contain either sildenafil citrate 50 mg placebo administer . In manner patient test placebo use sildenafil use respectively . The participant take clinical exercise physiology laboratory test separate night 's sleep least 12 hour . Monitoring equipment mounted period drug absorbtion distribution . 1 . One minute handgrip static exercise perform describe 80 % maximal strength apply . BP response register beat beat . 2 . Pulmonary function examine , include pulmonary volume ( single breath , technical description see ) , spirometry 3 . Cardiopulmonary exercise test accord main protocol ( see 3.8 ) 4 . Exercise echocardiography supine bicycle exercise perform describe main protocol ( see 3.7 ) . Other monitor supine cycle exercise : 1 . ECG 2 . Diffusion capacity monitor ( intra breath , technical description ) . For equipment calibration haemoglobin concentration measure fingertip blood sample cycle exercise . 3 . Cardiac output peripheral oxygen saturation continuously monitor Task Force Monitor ( see ) 5 . Pulmonary function test repeat 6 . Handgrip test repeat 1 . Difffusion capacity monitor There two way measure diffusion capacity use SensorMedics V-max analyze system ( Yorba Linda , CA , USA ) - intra breath single breath . Measurements force vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume ( FEV1 ) , FEV1 ratio ( FEV1/FVC ) , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) , total lung capacity ( TLC VA ) , diffusion capacity carbon monoxide ( TLCO ) , adjust diffuse capacity ( TLCO/VA ) , residual volume ( RV ) , capillary blood volume ( Vc ) membrane conductance ( Dm ) include analysis perform accord European Respiratory Society standard . Single breath The diffusion capacity use estimate amount gas travelling lung bloodstream across membrane . In process methane ( CH4 ) use concentration 0.3 % , 0.3 % carbon monoxide ( CO ) , 21 % oxygen ( O2 ) nitrogen ( N2 ) . In estimation TLCO several measurement include ; 1 ) area gas transportation alveoli capillary ( A ) , 2 ) wall thickness ( membrane ) alveolus erythrocyte ( T ) , 3 ) amount haemoglobin available ( Hb ) 4 ) reaction rate CO Hb ( Î¸ ) determinants amount CO manage diffuse across blood57 . In process CH4 use marker , diffuse across blood become dilute . CH4 mixes residual volume lung , degree dilution use calculate alveoli volume . CO diffuse across blood addition become dilute . By measure amount CO CH4 expiration air compare inhale gas , hold breath 8-10 second , get expression diffusion capacity lung . Figure 1 : The single-breath method TLCO Intra breath Intra breath reefer continuous real-time measurement carbon monoxide uptake pulmonary capillary blood single breath maneuver . Intra breath maneuver may perform exercise . The calibration procedure sample set span point 0.3 % CO 0.3 % CH4 ( methane ) . The patient start normal breathing instruct exhale much possible - inhale completely . After total inhalation patient exhale slow even flow computer end test . The test window show gas concentration versus time volume versus time trace real time maneuver . The flow versus time curve show simultaneously . The collection interval use calculation TLCO extend 20 - 80 % exhaled volume ( marked area figure 2 ) . Figure 2 . The intra breath method TLCO The patient need practice maneuver rest use exercise . The exhalation time reduce exercise , patient must try exhale slowly order analysis correct . Cardiopulmonary monitoring analysis When analyse change vascular resistance exercise measurement pressure part hemodynamic picture . According Ohms law , blood flow measurement necessary conclude vascular resistance . For purpose , non-invasive cardiac stroke volume analyser base thoracic impedance technique , use . ( Task Force Monitor , CNS system , product description enclose ) This equipment validate cardiac output monitoring compare thermodilution gold standard . Combined beat beat finger cuff system measurement blood pressure , machine produce core circulatory parameter continuously . Autonomic nervous function ( BP variation , HR variation ) baroreflex sensitivity also analyse . Continuous measurement peripheral oxygen saturation register Masimo SET pulse oximeter . 13.4 Statistics Responses without sildenafil compare within individual . For parameter affected calibration difference machinery test 1 2 delta value compare . Power analysis : Data main study allow estimation anticipate result statistical power . If average maximal RVSP exercise group 50 mmHg sildenafil cause 20 % decrease average 40 mmHg ( SD 10.0 ) sample size 13 patient lead statistical power 81.7 % 5 % confidence level ( calculation : DSS research 10.7.2008 , http : //www.dssresearch.com/toolkit/spcalc/power_a2.asp</detailed_description>
