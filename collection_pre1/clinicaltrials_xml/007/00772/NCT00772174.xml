	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Pioglitazone Combined With Metformin Metabolic Syndrome Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes none common , chronic disease worldwide affect nearly 200 million people . It fourth fifth lead cause death develop country , expect diabetes reach epidemic proportion , affect 333 million people globally 2025 . The metabolic syndrome cluster dangerous cardiovascular risk factor include diabetes pre-diabetes addition abdominal obesity , low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , high triglyceride hypertension . It estimate around quarter world 's adult population metabolic syndrome , twice likely die three time likely heart attack stroke compare people without syndrome . In addition , non-diabetic people metabolic syndrome fivefold great risk develop type 2 diabetes . The cluster cardiovascular risk factor typifies metabolic syndrome consider drive force cardiovascular disease epidemic . Metabolic syndrome recently define Consensus Conference International Diabetes Federation cluster clinical laboratory sign characterize presence abnormal deposition fat tissue abdomen visceral district , least two clinical laboratory abnormality , include alter glucose metabolism type 2 diabetes decreased level high-density lipoprotein cholesterol . One underlying pathophysiological mechanism metabolic syndrome insulin resistance , characterize increase glucose output liver , reduce glucose uptake muscle adipose tissue cell . Drugs whose mechanism action consist increase insulin sensitivity target tissue able reduce clinical manifestation consequence metabolic syndrome . While individual component metabolic syndrome confers increase risk cardiovascular-related complication death , risk pronounce syndrome present . The component metabolic syndrome evident , high cardiovascular mortality rate .</detailed_description>
