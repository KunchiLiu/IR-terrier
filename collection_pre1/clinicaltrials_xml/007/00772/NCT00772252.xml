	<brief_summary>Background : In patient undergoing hemodialysis hemofiltration suffer injury reactive oxidative specie . Oxidative stress affect cell membrane , protein , DNA . It damage cell result organ dysfunction . We believe patient , acute hepatic failure , undergo plasma exchange Molecular Absorbent Recirculating System bridge therapy suffer injury reactive oxidative specie , . It damage kidney , lung , cerebral cortex , organ . It may result death recovery liver function undergo liver transplantation . Aims : 1 . Investigate severity oxidative stress risk factor high oxidative stress acute hepatic failure patient undergo plasma exchange Molecular Absorbent Recirculating System . 2 . Investigate microcirculation status risk factor acute hepatic failure patient undergo plasma exchange Molecular Absorbent Recirculating System . 3 . Study relationship oxidative stress microcirculation status . 4 . Study correlation oxidative stress prognosis . 5 . Study correlation microcirculation status prognosis .</brief_summary>
