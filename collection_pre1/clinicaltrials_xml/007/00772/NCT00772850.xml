	<brief_title>Rotator Cuff Injury Antegrade Locked Nailing Humeral Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : With improved implant design surgical technique , operative treatment humeral shaft fracture increasingly become accepted . Such treatment offer several advantage . The rigidly fix , fracture limb use early without external support , patient sleep , normal , supine position . In addition , angular deformity often see conservative treatment effectively prevent . Although plate osteosynthesis afford rigid fixation good functional recovery , disadvantage report . By comparison , lock nailing , provide sufficient fixation stability prevents slipout nail , offer advantage less soft tissue injury , low infection rate , need radial nerve extrication . Locked nailing preferred especially open fracture , comminute fracture , pathologic fracture , fracture associate osteoporosis . The use Seidel lock nail spread fin complicate inadequate fixation , intraoperative bone comminution , unsatisfactory recovery shoulder function . Biomechanically , lock nails transfix lock screw allow much good rotational control distal fragment Seidel nail . Most rigid humeral nail insert antegrade , disadvantage antegrade nail risk shoulder function impairment , partially negate advantage close nail loadsharing mechanical property . The disadvantage retrograde nail potential risk elbow joint injury nonlinear entry portal nailing . Gaullier O et al study 23 case rotator cuff evaluation 1999 . Only humeral diaphyseal fracture enrol . Fracture type classification accord AO . Clinical shoulder assessment carry use Constant score . Treatment Seidel intramedullary lock nailing . Seidel intramedullary lock nailing big patient Taiwan . Compared patient western country , patient small stature . The humeral locked nail , invent Jinn Lin , provide proper treatment option humeral fracture Asian people . Although H-L nail advantage minimal tissue trauma , still possibility rotator cuff injury . The purpose study evaluate rotator cuff injury antegrade humeral lock nailing humeral fracture mean sonographic evaluation shoulder functional examination . Materials method : I. Implant design : The Humeral Locked nail uniform close cylindrical tube 5° bend 70 mm thread end . It manufacture 316L stainless steel ( Carpenter Technology Corporation , Indianapolis , IN ) 4 size : 7 ( diameter ) x 190 ( length ) mm , 7 x 210 mm , 8 x 210 mm , 8 x 230 mm . The thickness nail wall 1.5 mm 8 mm nail 1 mm 7 mm nail . There 3 parallel screw hole ( 2 outermost hole usually use ) thread end , 45° oblique axis nail , 2 transverse screw hole end . Cortical screw use lock screw insert guide L shape , nail mount target device . II . Patient selection : The inclusion criterion patient present study list follow : ( 1 ) subject must sign date informed consent ; ( 2 ) subject must fifteen year old , either sex ; ( 3 ) subject suffer acute humeral fracture non-unions ; ( 4 ) subject treat antegrade H-L nailing ( United , Taipei , Taiwan ) ; 5 ) subject solid union fracture ; 6 ) postoperative time least 12 month ; 7 ) subject operate 2003 2006 . The exclusion criterion patient present study list follow : ( 1 ) subject refuse take examination , ( 2 ) subject lose follow , ( 3 ) subject pre-existing shoulder problem . III . Study design : Our study design retrospective , cross-sectional study . Patients acute humeral fracture nonunions treat antegrade H-L nailing recruit study . Sonographic evaluation rotator cuff do experienced orthopedist shoulder functional score Neer score , Constant score QuickDASH score assess time . Real-time sonography perform Sonoline Sienna scanner ( HDI-5000 , Philips , USA ) equip 5.5-9.4-MHz linear-array transducer . The patient seat stool examiner sit front . Lateral transverse view lateral longitudinal view acquire . For two view , arm examine patient place adduction internal rotation , give good exposure supraspinatus tendon acromion . Criteria full-thickness rotator cuff tear nonvisualization rotator cuff hypoechoic anechoic discontinuity . Besides , criteria partial- thickness rotator cuff tear include focal heterogenous hypoechogenecity incomplete hypoechoic cleft . Measurement rotator cuff tear do lateral transverse longitudinal view . The width rotator cuff tear measure lateral transverse view , height rotator cuff tear measure lateral transverse view . Moreover , length rotator cuff tear measure lateral longitudinal view . The thickness rotator cuff dome humeral head measure lateral transverse compare operative sound side . We calculate ratio thickness supraspinatus operative side sound side . a. Thickness rotator cuff tear : Size ( full partial ) : i. width ( mm ) ii . height ( mm ) iii . length ( mm ) b. visualization nail c. scar : nature size d. supraspinatus thickness ( mm ) : IV . Baseline variables primary endpoint : We include patient 's age gender , fracture location , fracture cause , presence nail removal , post-operative period comorbidity associate disease independent variable . Fracture location either humeral neck humeral shaft . Humeral neck fracture define fracture surgical neck humerus . Humeral neck fracture categorize three group : two-part , three-parts four-parts , accord Neer classification . Meanwhile , humeral shaft fracture define fracture surgical neck humerus 5 cm olecarnon fossa . Humeral shaft fracture separate three group : proximal third shaft fracture , middle third shaft fracture distal third shaft fracture . Fracture cause included simple fall traffic accident . We calculate post-operative period accord late operation involve rotator cuff injury , include antegrade H-L nailing nail removal . For example , patient X treat antegrade H-L nailing two year ago receive nail removal one year ago , ( ) post-operative period twelve month rather twenty-four month . The primary endpoint present study functional score sonographic finding . As functional score , choose Neer score , Constant score QuickDASH score endpoint . Neer score consist pain component , function component , range motion component anatomy component . The interpretation Neer score list follow : excellent Neer score 89 unit , satisfactory Neer score 80 89 unit , unsatisfactory Neer score 70 79 unit , failure Neer score 70 unit . Constant score consist pain , activity level , arm positioning , strength abduction range motion . We examine Constant score affect healthy shoulder calculate difference Constant score two shoulder . The interpretation accord difference Constant score : excellent ( 0~5 point ) , good ( 6~10 point ) , good ( 11~20 point ) , fair ( 21~30 point ) poor ( 30 point ) . The QuickDASH outcome measure questionnaire ask patient 's symptom well ( ) ability perform certain activity . Patients answer questionnaire base condition last week . V. Statistics : We include age , gender , fracture location , fracture cause , presence nail removal , post-operative period comorbidity independent variable . We use Neer score , Constant score , QuickDASH score , presence full-thickness rotator cuff tear , partial-thickness rotator cuff tear scar , supraspinatus thickness ratio dependent variable . Univariate analysis conduct Student 's test continuous variable Chi square test binary variable . We also multivariate regression analysis adjust confound factor . The difference consider statistically significant p value 0.05 . VI . Sample size calculation ( power analysis ) : Neer score : The primary endpoint use calculation sample size . We assume standard deviation Neer score patient 12 point . How many patient require 80 % power detect 10-point difference mean functional score two group 5 % level significance ? The required sample size 48 patient ( 24 patient group ) .</detailed_description>
