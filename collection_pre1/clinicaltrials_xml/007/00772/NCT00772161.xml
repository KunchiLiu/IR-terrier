	<detailed_description>Study Design This single center , Phase I , prospective , randomize , single blind , two-treatment cross-over study . 24 patient enrol . Study duration patient approximately 4 week ( screening/inclusion ) . Based assumption 5 month recruitment , total study duration approximately 6 month . Target Population A number 24 prepubertal boy age 8 - 14 year Diagnosis ADHD accord DSM IV enrol study ensure 18 subject complete assessment . The prepuberal status determine Tanner stage ≤ 2 . Diagnosis confirm K-SADS-PL . Patients allow enter trial subject subject´s parents/legal guardian provide inform consent participation ( follow full explanation trial ) write informed consent document sign . In addition , verified physician patient meet Inclusion Criteria none Exclusion Criteria . Study Treatment Study medication either Ritalin LA 20 mg Medikinet ret . 20 mg . Patients pre-treatment psychotropic drug Methylphenidate individual washout period inclusion study . This individual washout period last 5 elimination half-life take drug . After randomization patient enter 2 week treatment phase crossover day 8 . Patients randomize Sequence 1 treat Ritalin LA first week ( day 1 day 7 ) Medikiniet ret . second week ( day 8 day 14 ) ; patient randomize Sequence 2 treat Medikinet ret . first week ( day 1 day 7 ) Ritalin LA second week ( day 8 day 14 ) . The study population randomize equally Sequence 1 Sequence 2 group Visit 2 . The study end 5 week enrollment last patient ( total study end ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient parents/authorized legal representative must understand nature study able comply protocol requirement . Male patient age 814 Tanner stage 0 2 BMI 10th 90th age percentile Patients diagnosis ADHD type accord DSMIV criterion , establish history , psychiatric examination structure diagnostic interview ( KiddieSADSPresent Lifetime Version ) Patients , whose symptom adequately control stable welltolerated dose immediate release methylphenidate equivalent 15 mg 30 mg least one month screening . Patients parent legal guardian , give write informed consent child participate study . Additionally , assent participate must obtain child enter study . Assent document child 's signature consent form . Health status : Patients must clinically significant disease clinically significant abnormal laboratory value assess medical history physical exam . Patients meet minimum intelligence requirement : In opinion investigator patient must generally function ageappropriate level academically , take account prior cognitive academic testing ( basic knowledge reading , write calculate ) . Patients already receive behavioral therapy ADHD may continue course trial . Patients comorbid psychiatric condition symptoms require current pharmacological treatment ( e.g . major depression , psychosis ) . Patients comorbid psychiatric somatic condition may contraindicate treatment confound efficacy safety assessment . Patients take concomitant medication likely interfere study drug confound efficacy safety assessment , e.g . Tricyclic antidepressant , SSRIs except Fluoxetine , bupropion , clonidine , buspirone 2 week randomization ; Atomoxetine 2 week randomization ; Fluoxetine antipsychotic 1 month randomization ; Pemoline amphetamines 1 week randomization . Patients know nonresponse methylphenidate . History hypersensitivity study drug drug similar chemical structure . Patients judge investigator likely noncompliant study procedure , include suspected history substance abuse , patient live person diagnose substance abuse disorder . Use investigational drug time enrollment , within 30 day 5 halflives enrollment , whichever long Patients warning , mentioned German Basic Prescribing Information Ritalin LA ( SmPC current version ) Medikinet retard ( SmPC current version ) : anorexia , severe depression , anxiety disorder , Gilles de la TouretteSyndrome , tic disorder , hypertension , occlusive arterial disease , severe stenocardia , tachycardiac arrhythmia , stroke , hyperthyroidism , increase intraocular pressure , hypertrophy prostate , know hypersensitivity sympathomimetics , MAOinhibitors . Patients history seizure disorder . History malignancy organ system , treat untreated , within past 5 year whether evidence local recurrence metastasis , exception localize basal cell carcinoma skin .</criteria>
