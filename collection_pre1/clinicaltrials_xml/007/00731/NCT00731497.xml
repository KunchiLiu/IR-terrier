	<brief_title>Solar Water Disinfection Intervention Trial Bolivia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More one third population rural peri-urban area develop country access sufficient clean drinking water free pathogen . Thus , waterborne gastroenteritis remain major infrastructural public health problem particularly , effective treatment ( filtration , chlorination , treatment plant ) often beyond financial mean environmental resource use water purification ( fire-boiling , burn carbon-based fuel ) become scarce community . In context solar disinfection drinking water especially appeal use combination irradiation direct sunlight solar heating kill water-borne patho¬gens contaminate drinking water . To date , efficacy SODIS technology home-based , low-cost intervention provide safe drinking water low income country well establish , large-scale promotion dissemination program way seven Latin American country . The principal objective study evaluate effectiveness home-based solar water disinfection ( SODIS ) reduce burden gastrointestinal illness child 5 year rural village participate country-wide Bolivian SODIS program . We conduct community ( cluster ) -randomized control trial follow cohort child &lt; 5 community . Totally , 22 community select among district designate country-program receive SODIS intervention . A pair-matched design employ community first rank accord baseline incidence diarrheal disease intervention assign within 11 consecutive pair community randomly one . In cluster , 30 child ( 660 total ) enrol follow 12 month . Data diarrheal illness obtain morbidity diary keep mother validated weekly home visit . Stool sample collect baseline morbidity survey time diarrheal episode child follow-up . Water quality monitor raw water source use drinking water water sample treatment SODIS device conduct systematically . Mothers participate child interview baseline trial regard current water use , behavioral environmental exposure child home within community . This study specifically estimate ; . ) much efficacy SODIS technology establish laboratory experiment two tightly control¬led phase-III trial retain effectiveness i.e . program condition , ii . ) preventive fraction all-cause child-diarrhea attributable SODIS . In addition , pathogen-specific attributable risk diarrheal illness calculate . The project organise University California , Berkeley , substantial experience water intervention trial US benefit tradition North-South collaboration public health research Swiss Tropical Institute , Basel , Switzerland . It run jointly Universidad Mayor de San Simon coordinate Bolivian SODIS program .</detailed_description>
