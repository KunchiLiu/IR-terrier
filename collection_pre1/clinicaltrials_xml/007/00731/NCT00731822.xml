	<criteria>Subjects eligible enrollment study must meet following criterion : 1 . Informed consent : Subjects must give sign write informed consent participate . 2 . Gender : Male subject female subject nonchild bear potential ( e.g . postmenopausal surgical sterile ) 40 80 year age screening ( Visit 1 ) . Postmenopausal female define amenorrhoeic great 2 year appropriate clinical profile , e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom . However indicate confirmed estradiol FSH level consistent menopause ( accord laboratory range ) screening ( Visit 1 ) . Surgically sterile female define document ( medical report verification ) hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy Tubal Ligation . Furthermore , male subject study must use doublebarrier ( condom/spermicide ) birth control method abstain sexual intercourse female partner pregnant , lactating , able bear child addition birth control method female partner use , first dose study medication 90 day last dose study medication . 3 . COPD diagnosis : Subjects clinical history COPD accordance follow definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society [ Celli , 2004 ] : COPD preventable treatable disease characterize airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Although COPD affect lung , also produce significant systemic consequence . 4 . Tobacco use : subject current previous history ≥ 10 packyears cigarette smoke screening ( Visit 1 ) . Previous smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . • Number pack year = ( number cigarette per day/20 ) ) x number year smoke 5 . Severity Disease : subject conform current severity classification Stage II/III disease term postbronchodilator spirometry Screening Visit 1 : Subject measure postsalbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio ≤0.70 Subjects measure postsalbutamol FEV1 ≥ 40 % ≤ 80 % predict normal value calculate use NHANES III reference equation . Subjects meet follow criterion must enrol study : 1 . Pregnancy : Women pregnant lactate 2 . Asthma : Subjects current diagnosis asthma . ( Subjects prior history asthma eligible COPD current diagnosis ) 3. α1 antitrypsin deficiency : Subjects α1 antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD 4 . Other respiratory disorder : Subjects active tuberculosis , lung cancer , bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , lung fibrosis , pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease active pulmonary disease 5 . Lung Resection : Subjects lung volume reduction surgery within 12 month prior Screening 6 . Chest Xray ( CT scan ) : Subjects chest Xray ( CT scan ) reveals evidence clinically significant abnormality believe due presence COPD . A chest Xray must take Screening chest Xray CT scan available within 6 month prior Screening 7 . Poorly control COPD : Subjects poorly control COPD , define occurrence follow 6 week prior Screening : Acute worsen COPD manage subject corticosteroid antibiotic , Acute worsen COPD require treatment prescribed physician Subjects hospitalize due poorly control COPD within 12 week Screening Visit 8 . Lower respiratory tract infection : Subjects low respiratory tract infection require use antibiotic within 6 week prior Visit 1 9 . 12lead ECG ( Electrocardiogram ) : An abnormal clinically significant 12lead ECG result active medical problem . For study , abnormal ECG define 12lead tracing interpret , limited , follow : Clinically significant conduction abnormality ( e.g . leave bundle branch block , WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome ) Clinically significant arrhythmia ( e.g . atrial fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia ) The independent cardiologist , contract GSK , determine clinical significance ECG abnormalities determine subject preclude enter study . However , follow predetermine ECG abnormality consider clinically significant result exclusion subject : Ventricular rate &lt; 45 bpm PR interval &gt; 240 msec Evidence SecondDegree ( Mobitz type II ) ThirdDegree atrioventricular ( AV ) block Pathological Q wave Nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay STT wave abnormality ( exclude nonspecific STT wave abnormality ) Right leave complete bundle branch block A mean QTc ( B ) value Screening &gt; 450 msec , uncorrected QT &gt; 600 msec ECG suitable QT measurement ( e.g . poorly define termination T wave ) 10 . Other Diseases/abnormalities : Subjects historical current evidence clinically significant cardiovascular , neurological , psychiatric , renal , hepatic , immunological , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes thyroid disease ) haematological abnormality uncontrolled . Significant define disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk participation , would affect efficacy safety analysis disease/condition exacerbate study . 11 . Hepatitis : Subjects positive Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody prestudy Screening 12 . Hypertension : Subjects clinically significant hypertension uncontrolled 13 . Cancer : Subjects carcinoma complete remission least 5 year . • Carcinoma situ cervix , squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma skin would exclude subject consider cure within 5 year since diagnosis . 14 . Drug/food allergy : Subjects history hypersensitivity study medication ( e.g . betaagonists , corticosteroid ) component inhalation powder ( e.g . lactose , magnesium stearate ) . Or history drug allergy history severe milk protein allergy , opinion study physician , contraindicate subject 's participation 15 . Drug/alcohol abuse : Subjects know suspected history alcohol drug abuse within last 2 year 16 . Medication prior spirometry : Subjects medically unable withhold rescue medication 6hour period require prior spirometry test study visit . 17 . Oxygen therapy : Subjects receive treatment longterm oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) nocturnal oxygen therapy require great 12 hour day . Oxygen prn use ( i.e . ≤ 12 hour per day ) exclusionary . 18 . Pulmonary rehabilitation : Subjects participate acute phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programme within 4 week prior Screening enter acute phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programme study . Subjects maintenance phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programme may include . 19 . Noncompliance : Subjects risk noncompliance , unable comply study procedures 20 . Questionable validity Consent : Subjects history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation condition limit validity inform consent participate study 21 . Prior use study medication/other investigational drug : Subjects receive GW642444 previous study . Subjects receive investigational drug within 30 day entry study ( Screening ) , within 5 drug halflives investigational drug , whichever longer 22 . Sleep apnea : Subjects clinically significant sleep apnea uncontrolled . 23 . Affiliation investigator site : Study investigator , subinvestigators , study coordinator , employee participate investigator immediate family member aforementioned excluded participating study</criteria>
