	<brief_summary>There grow interest generate dendritic cell ( DCs ) use vaccine . Several cytokine , especially stem cell factor ( SCF ) FLT3-ligand ( FL ) , identify essential produce large number myeloid precursor even increase DC yield obtain action granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-Î± ) . However , study effect early-acting cytokine , commonly use expand CD34+ progenitor cell , DC generation . We establish serious functional analysis maturate immaturated DCs include surface marker screen cytokine production . Here , design two-year project evaluate possible methodology generation CD14+CD1a- CD14- CD1a+ myeloid DC precursor CD34+ cell . In first year project , set standard protocol generate DC precursor cord blood stem cell . In first step , isolate CD34+ cell cord blood amplify cell . Purity CD34+ cell population obtain great 90 % . In next step , primary culture CD34+ cell treat early-acting cytokine GM-CSF IL-4 induction dendritic cell . Functional analysis dendritic cell would perform stage . In second year project , evaluate induction DCs CD34+ stem cell could affect combination mesenchymal stromal cell . These result research CD34+-based DCs induction provide basis material develop DC-based vaccine viral fungal infection , might powerful tool anti-tumor immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
