	<brief_summary>Background : When consider malignancy limit life expectancy , palliation quality life paramount . Owing limited centre offer ERCP endoscopic palliation South African state sector , patient often travel vast distance spend large amount time away family social support structure , severely impair quality life . Stent occlusion resultant readmission ERCP accredit centre obviously compound problem . The hypothesis propose test whether metal stent primary procedure result well patency rate , cost effective improve quality life plastic stent . We propose mean randomise trial determine best method palliation inoperable distal common bile duct malignancy South African context . Primary end-point Assessing cost metal versus plastic stenting inoperable malignant distal common bile duct strictures patient expect survival 3 month palliation symptomatic obstructive jaundice . Cost assess term hardware , hospital stay readmission stent occlusion ( patency ) complication Secondary end-point Assessing quality life use validate score system ( EORTC QLQ 30 ) patient receive metal plastic biliary stent definitive mean palliation malignant obstructive jaundice Hypothesis test Metal stent superior plastic stent term patency , result cost effective palliation inoperable malignant jaundice well quality life due few stent occlusions/episodes cholangitis .</brief_summary>
