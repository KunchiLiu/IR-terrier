	<brief_summary>Background : The safety vaccination patient autoimmune disease use immune suppressive therapy often discuss . Previous study Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ( JIA ) patient show increase disease activity immunisation dead vaccine . The safety live attenuate Measles , Mumps , Rubella ( MMR ) vaccination assess retrospectively JIA patient increase disease activity find . However , must prospectively confirm . In addition , unknown whether vaccination effective , since immune response vaccination may diminish due immunosuppressive therapy underlie disease . Finally , influence MMR vaccination immune system JIA patient study . Among others , regulatory T-cells ( Tregs ) control immune response prevent destructive autoimmune response environmental trigger vaccination . Objective : The aim present study investigate safety efficacy MMR booster vaccination influence immune regulatory mechanism child Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis . Method : JIA patient age 4 8 year treat pediatric rheumatology unit various University Medical Centers Netherlands , ask participate prospective study . In Netherlands , measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR ) vaccination include National Vaccination Program normally administer age 9 . Included patient randomise early vaccination ( age group 4 8yr entry study ) age 9 routinely do accord National Vaccination Program . Prior vaccination investigator assess disease activity collect blood . Outcome : During 12 month follow-up period investigator register disease activity side-effects different moment time determine safety vaccination . The efficacy vaccine study accord antibody level function measles , mumps rubella blood . Tregs isolated functionality determine use blood cell collect follow-up . This enable u study role influence vaccination regulatory mechanism immune system .</brief_summary>
