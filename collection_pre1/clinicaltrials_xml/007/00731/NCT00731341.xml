	<brief_title>Hysteroscopic Cryomyolysis Treatment Submucosal Leiomyomata</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently optimal method treat symptomatic uterine fibroid . Existing therapeutic option conservative ( medication ) , invasive ( e.g. , hysterectomy , surgical myomectomy ) , minimally invasive ( uterine artery embolization , myolysis ) . Fibroid ablation use cryogenic energy , know Cryoablation , offer potential alternative method fibroid treatment . Cryotherapy well-established technique treatment various benign malignant condition . Cryoablation describe treatment prostate cancer , renal cell carcinoma , liver tumor benign malignant breast tumor . Galil Medical 's propose feasibility study look examine technical success , safety feasibility hysteroscopic approach treatment symptomatic fibroid . This technique involve insertion placement Galil Medical 's 17-gauge cryoablation needle ( ) guide hysteroscopic device . Ultrasound provide real-time monitoring needle insertion , placement iceball propagation cryoablation procedure . This treatment offer patient preserve uterus minimally invasive procedure . The type fibroid intend treatment ( Type II submucous myoma ) often difficult completely safely remove hysteroscopically often treat open laparoscopic procedure . A hysteroscopic procedure involve intraperitoneal intervention therefore expect associated less intra-operative post-operative complication . The recovery hysteroscopic cryoablation expect fast minimal self resolve discomfort . The patient able return normal activity within 24-48 hour .</detailed_description>
