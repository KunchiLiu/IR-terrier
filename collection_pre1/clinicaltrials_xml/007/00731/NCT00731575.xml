	<brief_summary>The purpose study study prospectively early clinical immunological event child susceptible rhinovirus induce early wheezing ( i.e. , recently find high risk factor recurrent wheezing/asthma ) efficacy systemic corticosteroid modify event . Up 50 % child suffer acute wheeze school-age . The prevalence childhood asthma 5-7 % . Although pediatric asthma mainly allergic , exacerbation associate respiratory viral infection 95 % case . The mean predict asthma environmental factor limit mainly sensitization aeroallergens ( 3-fold risk ) , start develop usually 2-3 year age . VINKU 1-study ( orig . VINKU-study ) discover simultaneously two group , early wheezing associate rhinovirus , `` common cold '' virus , strong predictor recurrent wheezing/asthma ( 10-fold risky ) . Noteworthily , viral infection work risk marker already infancy , lot early sensitization aeroallergens . The investigator also find retrospectively early wheezers affect rhinovirus respond 3 day course oral prednisolone ( inexpensive widely available treatment ) : recurrent wheeze decrease 50 % follow 12 month difference appear continue . VINKU 5V-study currently investigate clinical history , prevalence asthma airway hyperreactivity child school-age . The mechanism rhinovirus associate risk respond prednisolone largely unknown . However , susceptibility rhinovirus infection associate atopy therefore possible child may impair anti-inflammatory ( Treg ) responses likely wheeze pro-inflammatory response ( Th1 Th2 ) . Moreover , may effectively clear virus , limit rhinovirus nose spread low airway cause wheeze . VINKU 2-study prospectively investigate immunological event young first-time wheezers affect rhinovirus , prospectively study clinical efficacy systemic corticosteroid . Most likely child benefit drug term less recurrent wheezing , investigator also explore immunological effect drug link clinical efficacy . The result expect give basis prevention asthma development new treatment strategy directly apply clinical medicine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Viral Inception Asthma : Prospective Study From Infancy School-age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main Hypothesis Anticipated Results Virology 1 . Rhinovirus common causative agent bronchiolitis . 2 . Persistence rhinovirus ( virus ) infection worsen long-term outcome . 3 . The dose virus inoculation time acute wheezing ( assessed semi-quantitatively rhinovirus respiratory syncytial virus ) relate outcome . Immunology 4 . Children susceptible rhinovirus induce early wheezing alter immunology ( T cell regulation interferon response ) compare child RSV induce wheeze child rhinovirus induce upper respiratory infection without wheeze . 5 . These immunological event related recurrent wheeze asthma inception . Therapeutic intervention systemic corticosteroid Systemic corticosteroid child susceptible rhinovirus-induced early wheezing 6. decrease persistence rhinovirus infection 7. decrease severity relapse first wheezing episode , prevents recurrent wheezing , asthma , 8. prevents Th2-polarization , favour Th1- Treg-responses treatment period . Design Time Prospective , randomize , double blind , placebo control , parallel , one-center trial . The study commence 6/2007 . Inclusion Criteria Age 3-23 month , deliver &gt; 37 week , first wheeze episode , write informed consent guardian . Inclusion Criteria Intervention Follow-up Rhinovirus PCR positive wheezing episode still sign low respiratory symptom ( cough , noisy breathe wheeze ) time initiation study drug . Inclusion Criteria Follow-up without Intervention Any rhinovirus negative wheezing episode . Exclusion Criteria Chronic illness atopy , previous systemic inhale corticosteroid treatment , participation another study ( exclude long-term follow-up study childhood ) , varicella contact previously intact , need intensive care unit treatment , poor understanding Finnish . Intervention The need hospitalization decide independently study on-duty physician emergency room . Whether hospitalize , eligible child ( rhinovirus positive wheezers , n=70 ) randomly assign ( 2 separate randomization list : one hospitalize one out-patients ) double-blind fashion receive either oral prednisolone ( first dose 2 mg/kg ( max 60 mg ) , 2 mg/kg/d ( max 60 mg/d ) 3 divide dos 3 day , Prednisolon® , 5 mg tablet , Oy Leiras Finland Ab , Helsinki , Finland ) placebo inform consent obtain . The randomization code list store hospital pharmacy reveal child complete first 2 month study . Separate cod patient store patient chart reveal case emergency . The tablet package indistinguishable appearance active drug ( Oy Leiras Finland Ab , Helsinki , Finland ) provide numbered container . The study drug administer nurse independent study parent . The tablet mince administer jelly yogurt . All patient receive nebulized albuterol 0.15 mg/kg 2 h interval first 12 h , 4 h interval hospital . After discharge , beta2-agonists use demand . The patient receive antibiotic nebulized epinephrine ( emergency room hospital ) demand . Risk-benefit ratio Previously , efficacy prednisolone evaluate post-hoc rhinovirus induce early wheezing &lt; 3 year-old-children . The prevalence relapse within 2 month discharge 22 % prednisolone group 56 % placebo group . This observation need confirm prospective randomize trial , purpose current study . Prednisolone find beneficial RSV-induced early wheeze many study therefore , recommend child . Neither , prednisolone use upper respiratory tract infection without wheeze . Short course ( 5 day ) prednisolone use decade treatment wheeze illness well tolerate . There data dosage patient group could cause similar long-term neurological consequence systemic corticosteroid treatment mechanically ventilated premature infant suffer severe respiratory distress syndrome . Sample Size Required sample size intervention &gt; 70 rhinovirus positive wheezing patient , include &gt; 35 infant prednisolone group &gt; 35 infant placebo group . In addition , &gt; 200 healthy control child ( wheeze first 2 year life ) recruit followed school age . Our primary endpoint occurrence new wheeze episode within 2 month discharge . According previous data rhinovirus induce first second episode wheeze child age less 3 year , prevalence relapse within 2 month discharge prednisolone group 22 % placebo group 56 % . To maintain alpha error 0.05 beta error 0.20 , require size sample 29 child treatment group 2-month follow-up . When assess risk development asthma age 6 year , expect 60 % rhinovirus group 18 % RSV group develop asthma age . We expect approximately 10-20 % child discontinue study within 6 year . Thus , 35 child need group follow-up school-age . We expect approximately 15-25 subject virus specific group sufficient reveal immunologically clinically meaningful difference . Recruitment Study subject recruit outpatient clinic Department Pediatrics , Pediatric Infectious Diseases Ward Turku University Hospital . Study physician/nurse on-duty physician/nurse tell guardian study given write information study . After guardian adequate time get familiar study change ask , his/her signature seek informed consent form study commence . Description Laboratory Methods VINKU 2-study The study protocol present Table 1 . Several laboratory analysis enable u address question regard relationship viral infection , T cell regulation , genetics , atopy , pulmonary function . Laboratory work do accord modern standard . Outcomes Intervention Primary outcome : The occurrence time new physician-confirmed wheezing episode within 2 month discharge ; number physician-confirmed wheeze episode first 12 month discharge ; diagnose asthma full study period . Asthma define accord NAEPP Guidelines ( http : //www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma ) . Secondary outcome : Up 2 week acute respiratory tract infection , severity symptom ( cough , wheeze , noisy breathing , breathlessness , rhinitis ) assess 4-graded scale ( 0-3 , mild 1 , moderate 2 severe 3 ) parent well exact number bronchodilator puff use ( symptom diary 1 ) . Up 2 month acute respiratory tract infection , parent record day rhinitis , cough , noisy breathing , wheeze , night-time symptom , medication ( bronchodilator , corticosteroid antibiotic ) visit physician hospitalization wheeze ( symptom diary 2 ) . Up 12 month , number out-patient care visit hospitalization wheeze course systemic inhaled corticosteroid record ( diary 3 ) . Multiple immunologic marker pulmonary function 24-36 month age 6 year measure . Termination Study Criteria termination study : 1 . Parent guardian neglect study order . 2 . Parent guardian want continue study reason . 3 . Completion study . Ethical Aspects The study protocol approve Ethics Committee Turku University Hospital 11/2006 follow rule current revision Declaration Helsinki directives clinical research European Union ( HE 20/2004 ) . Patients guardian wo n't get financial benefit study . Children cover insurance ( potilasvakuutus ) . This academic project researcher conflict interest . Patient data confidential wo n't share outside research group without cod . All deviation original protocol report Ethics Committee Turku University Hospital national authority ( Lääkelaitos ) . Adverse event All adverse event hospitalization record four-point scale ( 0-3 ) possible relation study drug assess three-point scale ( , possible , likely , Appendix 4 ) . Parents ask record adverse event two-week home symptom diary ( Appendix 5 ) . Investigator shall report clinically meaningful adverse event timely correct manner national authority ( Lääkelaitos ) accord national law , Leiras / Drug Safety Officer Johanna Kause . In case premature termination trial , due safety concern , investigator shall write safety summary report immediately forward Leiras national authority . In case emergency , seal envelope contain randomization code available patient chart Turku University Hospital easily open .</detailed_description>
