Patients diseasefree 5 year , patient history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible . 5 . Concurrent disease condition would make patient inappropriate study participation include : ( 1 ) unresolved unstable serious toxicity prior administration another drug , ( 2 ) serious medical disorder would interfere patient 's safety , obtain informed consent , compliance study . 6 . History clinical evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , except individual previously treat parenchymal CNS metastasis , asymptomatic , requirement steroid anticonvulsant &gt; 2 month prior study enrollment . Routine screen CNS image study ( compute tomography [ CT ] magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) require clinically indicate , patient history CNS metastases . 7 . Malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . 8 . Active peptic ulcer disease , inflammatory bowel disease , gastrointestinal condition increase risk perforation . 9 . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 4 week prior begin therapy . 10 . Presence uncontrolled infection . 11 .
