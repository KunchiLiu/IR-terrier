	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Humira Treatment Cutaneous Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcoidosis multisystem disease . Cutaneous involvement occur approximately 25 % patient lesion morphology vary widely . There universally accept treatment sarcoidosis . Systemic agent oral corticosteroid frequently necessary treatment , long-term therapy limit multitude serious adverse effect . Steroid-sparing agent methotrexate , azathioprine , anti-malarials , pentoxifylline , allopurinol , thalidomide show beneficial select patient , limited due significant toxicity inconsistency efficacy . Infliximab chimeric , monoclonal antibody direct TNF-α currently approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat rheumatoid arthritis , ankylose spondylitis , Crohn 's disease . Etanercept dimeric fusion protein consist extracellular ligand-binding domain human TNF receptor link Fc portion human IgG1 . Etanercept approve treatment psoriasis , psoriatic arthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . Treatment infliximab etanercept generally well tolerated safe report . To date , report describe treatment sarcoidosis adalimumab . Adalimumab ( Humira ; Abbott Laboratories , Abbot Park , IL ) fully human , monoclonal antibody direct TNF-α approve US FDA treat rheumatoid arthritis . Given adalimumab target cytokine infliximab etanercept , one would expect adalimumab may also effective treatment sarcoidosis . Treatment adalimumab advantageous infliximab difference drug delivery . Infliximab deliver intravenously office . This require routine office visit vital sign monitoring health care professional . Adalimumab , hand , administer subcutaneously weekly every week patient home . Patients instructed proper injection technique one nurse visit . Additionally , adalimumab fully human , patient may less likely form antibody medication . Because lack alternative safe , effective treatment sarcoidosis , clinical trial evaluate efficacy adalimumab treatment sarcoidosis warrant .</detailed_description>
