	<brief_title>A Phase I Study New Tuberculosis ( TB ) Vaccine , MVA85A , Healthy Volunteers With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate safety MVA85A healthy volunteer Senegal infect HIV . In phase I study , single vaccination MVA85A , administer dose 5 x 107pfu intradermally , show safe mycobacterially naïve individual , previously vaccinate BCG latently infect individual . We use 1 x 10^8 pfu MVA85A intradermally study . A trial BCG vaccinate subject show high dose ( 1 x 10^8 pfu MVA85A ) induce significantly high immune response high AE profile . In addition , variable immune response , trial HIV positive subject UK split two group , first get 5 x 10^7 pfu second get 1 x 10^8 pfu MVA85A . It , therefore , decide use high dose order maximise immune response whilst maintain good safety profile .</detailed_description>
