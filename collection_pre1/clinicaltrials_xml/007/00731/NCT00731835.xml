	<brief_summary>You ask take part study doctor determine ischemic foot ulcer . This research study compare two approved standard care treatment modality management ischemic foot ulcer . The ischemic foot ulcer ( wound ) foot result block artery leg . The wound sometimes heal wound care alone , include dress change cream remove ( debriding ) dead tissue . Alternatively , significant narrowing blockage one arteries leg treat several endovascular treatment technique include : - angioplasty , also call percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) and/or - stent placement - atherectomy The hypothesis study early endovascular surgical intervention subject moderate arterial insufficiency non-healing foot ulcer result higher overall incidence wound heal significantly short period time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ischemic Foot Ulcers : Is Intervention Better Than Wound Care Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : This study single center , prospective , randomized trial evaluate benefit endovascular intervention heal ischemic foot ulcer compare best wound care alone . The study population comprise subject foot ulcer non-palpable diminish pedal pulse . The expected duration subject trial 2 year . Patients randomize two group : 1 . Wound Care ( group 1 ) -- Best standard wound care aggressive debridement 2 . Endovascular Intervention + Wound Care ( group 2 ) -- Best standard wound care combination endovascular revascularization Subjects undergo standard care evaluation ischemic foot ulcer . These evaluation would perform whether subject participate research study . In event clinically significant event unanticipated disease condition identify , subject doctor notify , investigator , review result test procedure standard care , result become part research record . Prior undergoing randomization , subject sign fully understand IRB consent form HIPAA compliant .</detailed_description>
