	<brief_summary>phase 2 study . Target disease : Crohn 's disease . Rational relevance IBD patient : Copaxone know high safety profile act effective immunomodulatory agent treatment MS. . In experimental model IBD , beneficial effect Copaxone demonstrate significant amelioration macroscopic colonic damage , preservation microscopic colonic structure , reduce weight loss , improve long-term survival treat compare untreated mouse demonstrate . In addition , Copaxone suppress proliferation local mesenteric lymphocytes syngeneic colon extract , significantly reduce overall secretion TNF-α induced secretion transform growth factor ( TGF ) -β . The ability Copaxone effectively modulate clinical manifestation detrimental immune response involve experimental colitis , together high safety profile support potential effect new treatment CD . Patients : patient moderately active Crohn 's disease indicate CDAI 220 - 450 , whose diagnosis do 3 month enrollment . Study objective : test efficacy safety Copaxone CD patient . Study design : This single center , randomize , double blind placebo control phase 2 study . Subjects assess study eligibility 1 2 week prior baseline Eligible patient enrol study signing inform consent form allocate 1.5:1 ratio receive either Copaxone placebo . A total 50 patient recruit . Subcutaneous injection ( Copaxone Placebo ) administer daily week 12 . Patient assessment safety efficacy make week 0,4,8,12 16 . At week 12 non-responders would offer open label arm daily Copaxone 20mg next 12 week</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Double Blind Placebo Control Study Assess Safety , Tolerability Efficacy Copaxone Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data evaluation : Evidence therapeutic benefit safety evaluate following assessment : Clinical assessment : - Crohn 's disease activity assess component CDAI . - Mucosal heal assess VCE ( data quantitated use Lewis score ) . Patients require colonoscopy accord Physicians decision would also offer participate endoscopic mucosal heal evaluation substudy . Patients participate undergo colonoscopy biopsy begin ( screening±1 week ) end ( week 12±1 week ) treatment period . Endoscopic damage assess use CDEIS - Mean ( median ) dose corticosteroids average total aggregate dose corticosteroid receive per patient trial assess . - Quality life assess component Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( IBDQ ) . Safety : - AE incidence - Physical examination - Clinical laboratory value - Vital sign Tolerability Safety : - Adverse event , dropout rate register . - Proportion subject prematurely discontinue study . - Proportion subject prematurely discontinue study due Aes - Time premature discontinuation - Time premature discontinuation due Aes . Immunologic assessment ( include lymphocyte proliferation cytokine secretion assay ) perform baseline visit well week 4 12 16 . Serum sample cytokine study 24 hour first injection would also collect .</detailed_description>
