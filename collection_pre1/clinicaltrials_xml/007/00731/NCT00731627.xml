	<brief_summary>Intracranial bleeding rupture blood vessel ( call subarachnoid haemorrhage -SAH ) affect 7000 patient year UK source considerable death disability , even young adult . Recent observation indicate bleeds cause reduce cerebral blood flow lead bad outcome . High rate death disability occur , particularly prevalent low cerebral blood flow result stroke . Prevention cerebral artery spasm improvement blood vessel reflex target modern therapy . Candidate drug include statin impeccable safety record multiple potential beneficial action ( improve cerebral blood flow , reduce inflammatory process , reduce adverse blood coagulation ) follow SAH . The investigator plan use statin , Simvastatin ( 40 mg ) improve cerebral blood flow reduce inflammation . We already complete phase 11 study ( n=80 ) demonstrate potential benefit acute statin therapy follow SAH , investigator wish conduct multi-centre phase 111 study explore potential clinical benefit large population ( n=1600 ) . The purpose see whether positive effect statins see phase II study translate clinical benefit - short term ( e.g . reduce need intensive care ) long term ( outcome wellbeing 6 month ) .</brief_summary>
