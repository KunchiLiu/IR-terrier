	<brief_summary>Tacrolimus ( Prograf ) medication commonly use patient receive kidney transplant . It consider one important medication prevent rejection transplant kidney suppress immune system . Although tacrolimus good preventing rejection , unwanted side effect . These side effect include high blood pressure , increase blood sugar , headache , tremor . In addition , tacrolimus cause damage transplant kidney time , cause healthy tissue turn scar tissue function well healthy tissue . Therefore , kidney function may reduce time . In first three month kidney transplant , Prograf level keep 8 10 ng/mL . This study compare two group patient tacrolimus dose reduce slowly three month prevent rejection decrease risk cause toxic effect kidney . One group Prograf level keep 6 8 ng/mL , second group level keep 3 5 ng/mL . We compare two group see difference kidney function time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thymoglobulin Induction Therapy With Minimal Immunosuppression Evaluation Allograft Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study assess safety efficacy immunosuppression-minimizing regimen consist initially Thymoglobulin induction combination tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil , rapid steroid withdrawal . The protocol minimize long-term calcineurin inhibitor exposure toxicity wean tacrolimus start 3 month transplantation . Patients eligible participate study already consent participate another study entitle `` The use urinary PCR test help detect rejection kidney transplant patient '' . In `` The use urinary PCR test help detect rejection kidney transplant patient '' , kidney allograft status ( ie . whether immunologic activity transplant kidney ) characterize use protocol biopsy , diagnostic biopsy , urinary PCR profile . At 3 month transplant , patient immunosuppression regimen consist tacrolimus ( Prograf ) mycophenolate mofetil ( CellCept ) . Prograf dose manage measurement trough level . For first 3 month transplant , patient maintain trough level 8 10 ng/ml . After 3 month , target level lower order minimize long-term exposure immunosuppressive agent . However , consensus proper level first 3 month . Therefore , study randomize patient 2 group , one group trough level target 6 8 ng/mL group trough target 3 5 ng/mL . By study , hope determine trough level best , protect patient rejection protect patient adverse effect immunosuppressive medication . At New York Weill Cornell Center , unique position attempt immunosuppression minimization due ability non-invasively monitor patient use urine . Previous investigation perform center demonstrate diagnostic accuracy mRNA level cytotoxic attack molecule urinary cell . Preliminary data show acute rejection , Granzyme B Perforin strongly express urine . The sensitivity uPCR test 88 % specificity 79 % . All kidney transplant recipient center invite participate research study entitle `` The use urinary PCR test help detect rejection kidney transplant patient '' . In protocol , serial analysis urinary cell perform determine 1 ) change mRNA level predict clinical acute rejection 2 ) level correlate presence subclinical acute rejection . Kidney transplant recipient serial urinary PCR measurement . In addition , patient undergo protocol biopsy transplant kidney 3 , 15 , 36 month transplant . The biopsy help show correlation PCR result pathology kidney . It may also serve detect rejection blood test urinary PCR show . In small subset patient , urinary gene expression profile cytotoxic attack molecule able predict acute rejection prior clinical diagnosis renal allograft biopsy . Because ability monitor transplant recipient use urinary PCR protocol , safely minimize tacrolimus exposure time monitor patient non-invasively real-time basis . Minimization immunosuppression time kidney transplant recipient important order prevent minimize leading cause kidney graft loss ( defined return dialysis ) . Although immunosuppressive medication excellent prevent rejection , detrimental effect cardiovascular system well transplant kidney . One major cause kidney graft loss today chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) . Formerly know `` chronic rejection '' , CAN describe progressive decline allograft function occur month year transplantation , second lead cause kidney graft loss . Biopsies kidney allograft CAN may show inflammation , fibrosis , glomerulosclerosis , tubular atrophy , vascular smooth muscle proliferation . The scar fibrosis associate CAN generally irreversible . A new goal within modern transplant arena prevent CAN occurring : 1. decrease early acute rejection episode 2. decrease calcineurin inhibitor-related nephrotoxicity With use modern immunosuppressive agent induction therapy , already decrease early acute rejection episodes significantly . At time , want begin study potentially beneficial effect calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal may kidney function well long-term graft survival .</detailed_description>
