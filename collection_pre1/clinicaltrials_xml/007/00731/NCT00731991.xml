	<detailed_description>Both ART PNF soft tissue technique use decrease muscle hypertonicity , myospasm , and/or trigger point increase overall function muscle . Active-release technique , ARTÂ® , form myofascial therapy use pain management involve soft-tissue manipulation . ART express goal restore optimal texture , motion , function soft tissue release entrapped nerve blood vessel . An injury soft-tissue structure commonly cause muscle shorten guard protect area . A clinician perform ART make soft contact one hand patient distal injured area hand develop tension soft tissue . While contact tension maintain , structure lengthen use `` active motion . '' During motion , lesion palpate physical contact patient change move slightly order concentrate tension appropriate tissue ( Swann , et al ) . Active Release Technique develop Dr. Michael Leahy widely use rehabilitative sport medicine myofacial pain syndrome . The ART group treat one investigator concurrence treatment method outline Dr. Leahy 's ART instructional manual . An ART treatment pas involve take tissue shorten position lengthen position administer maintain manual contact . We perform three pass ART 10 second rest period pass . We perform ART symptomatic side ( side fit inclusion criterion ) ; side involve , side consider separate analysis . The research back ART inadequate . Although numerous testimonial , limit publish research study could find . Dr. George 's study effect ART , HVLA treatment temporomandibular joint masticatory muscle show significant difference pre- post-treatment mouth opening measurement . Another ART study lateral epicondylitis conclude technique successful remove adhesion promote restoration normal tissue also state research inadequate ( Howitt , et al ) . A carpal tunnel study complete 2006 use EMG measure effectiveness ART . There significant improvement symptom severity functional status treatment , significant difference find EMG analysis ( George , Tepe , Busold 119-122 ) . Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation ( PNF ) stretch technique commonly use athletic clinical environment enhance active passive range motion ( ROM ) view optimize motor performance rehabilitation elongate muscle ( Sharman , et al ) . A second investigator perform PNF use publish protocol Warren Hammer , DC , MS , DABCO , text Functional Soft Tissue Examination Treatment Manual Methods , follow : The patient supine examiner support head neck contralateral sidebending ipsilateral rotation flexion . The whole cervical spine occiput fixed hold long-axis traction . With hand , examiner contact shoulder forearm parallel table push inferiorly determine end feel . While maintain position , examiner asks patient resist push shoulder superiorly examiner 's resistance 7 second . The examiner ask patient let go , stabilize head neck , depress shoulder far possible 12 second . A previous study PNF conclude technique cause short-term deficit strength , power output , muscle activation ; also increase range motion ( Marek , et al ) . A second previous study conclude PNF cause increase electromyographic activity masticatory muscle ( Olivo , et al ) . Surface EMG reliable , non-invasive tool use measure muscular electrical activity . Electromyography ( EMG ) provide unique information mechanical motor control strategies various type muscle action . EMG measure muscle activation , surface EMG reflect algebraic sum electric muscle action potential pass within record area EMG electrode . There , EMG amplitude quantifies muscle activation , alter number motor unit recruit fire rate activate motor unit . Thus , decrease EMG amplitude due decrease muscle activation ( Marek , et al ) . The surface EMG protocol perform completely third investigator . Farina , et al publish article show EMG give reliable indication muscle activity fatigue . A previous study muscle activity use surface EMG note base visual inspection , surface EMG variable show consistent linear moderately curvilinear behavior function time ( Muhammed , et al ) . Surface EMG widely use accept however care must take pad placement incorrect placement give reading improper musculature , conclude study Susan Mercer .</detailed_description>
