	<brief_summary>OUR OVERALL HYPOTHESIS post-transfusion survival allogeneic autologous RBCs accurately quantify anemic human infant use biotin-labeled RBCs combine mathematical modeling adjusts confound factor commonly encounter neonate . These confound factor include 1 ) dilution label RBC result growth stimulate erythropoiesis , anemia stimulate erythropoiesis , blood transfusion ; 2 ) loss label RBC due laboratory phlebotomy ; 3 ) variable RBC life span result RBCs produce different developmental period vary rate erythropoiesis . In contrast infant , adjustment factor necessary healthy adult condition steady state erythropoiesis . Instead adult , RBC survival typify linear decline concentration label RBCs time . When line extrapolate zero concentration , intercept time axis represent mean potential lifespan ( MPL ) RBCs . ( &lt; 7 ) store ( &gt; 21 ) allogeneic adult RBCs transfuse infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase I : Includes Aim # 1 Thrasher Foundation Grant adult subject study . SPECIFIC AIM # 1 ( Thrasher Foundation Grant ) : To develop vitro validate vivo adult human anemic infant capability biotinylating RBCs 5 discrete density simultaneously determine RBC kinetics multiple , distinct RBC population . This require expansion RBC biotin label technology previously develop . After refinement , method apply subsequent aim conduct anemic infant receive clinically order RBC transfusion . As suggested previous RBC survival study , anticipate heavy biotin label alter intrinsic RBC structural property RBCs , shorten long term survival . The vitro vivo validation study propose adult necessary condition reproducibly obtain discrete RBC biotin density appropriate , closely spaced interval conclusively work , determine empirically five density artifactually shorten long-term RBC survival . We use light density RBC survival measurement heavy density simultaneous RBC volume measurement need account RBC volume increase cause growth . It important perform feasibility study adults infant vastly different physiologic state , ie , normal , healthy adult steady state erythropoiesis critically ill , anemic infant experience multiple clinical circumstance perturb RBC survival , eg , growth , phlebotomy , intervene transfusion , etc . In addition biotin label RBC method , `` differential agglutination , antigenic method '' use flow cytometry apply infant receive allogeneic RBC transfusion . The result two method compare one another . The differential agglutination method utilizes difference RBC surface antigen donor recipient determine short- long-term RBC survival . Genotyping result adult donor infant recipient RBC antigens ( perform Mississippi Valley Regional Blood Center ) permit identification minor blood group difference donor recipient RBCs appropriately label minor RBC antibody ( available commercially use blood bank minor blood group RBC typing ) use flow cytometric determination RBC survival . RBC survival determine biotin label RBC antigenic difference compare among one . The differential agglutination/antigen method consider `` gold standard '' RBCs label ex-vivo , AFTER RBC transfusion , thus without modify RBC membrane surface proteins biotinylation . Our hypothesis addition much biotin lead artifactually shorten vivo RBC survival , low dos biotin . By also include differential agglutination/antigen method RBC survival result , able good validate multi-density biotin hypothesis . Our overall objective research improve red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion practice anemic , critically ill infant . This project receive support two granting agency : 1 ) The Thrasher Foundation , entitle , `` Red Blood Cell Recovery Survival Following Transfusion Infants ; '' 2 ) NIH PPG Grant P01 HL046925 , Project 1 entitle , `` Red Blood Cell Survival Following Transfusion In Infants . '' Abstracts include . This project complete two phase : Phase I include study autologous biotinylated RBCs transfuse normal , health adult human volunteer ( see Specific Aim # 1 Thrasher Foundation Abstract ) ; Phase II include study infant require physician order red blood cell transfusion ( see Specific Aims # 2 , # 3 , # 4 Thrasher Foundation Abstract ; see Specific Aim # 4 NIH include entirety three Thrasher Grant specific aim ) . The Phase I study complete longer enrol adult . We enrol infant Phase II study . We add phase sequentially base recommendation Martha Jones time proposal first submit IRB . We apply knowledge gain Phase I study adult subject volunteer make modification study design Phase II perform infant study subject receive clinically order RBC transfusion . At end Phase II , justification include new , comparison `` gold standard '' method determine RBC survival infant ( `` differential agglutination , antigenic method '' ) include . We complete enrollment adult subject phase I. ABSTRACT I ( FOR THRASHER FOUNDATION GRANT ) Background : Anemic , critically ill newborn infant among frequently transfuse group patient US . An estimated 130,000 infant annually receive approximately 1,000,000 RBC transfusion . Unlike adult , important data lack regard transfusion product optimal RBC survival infant . Contributing lack two major recent change neonatal blood banking transfusion practice . These 1 ) use transfuse adult donor blood store 42 day FDA limit instead use blood store less 7 day do previously ; 2 ) potential use infant 's blood harvest placenta avoid risk viral infection immune transfusion reaction donor blood . Unfortunately , definitive infant study address change directly measure RBC survival . Such infant study hamper technical problem . Specifically , RBC survival data must adjust growth , laboratory phlebotomy loss , intervene additional RBC transfusion practice . Moreover , safety issue preclude many infant RBC survival study ( eg , exposure 51Cr radioactivity removal much blood today 's tiny , premature infant ) . Indeed , prior 1970 ( end use 51Cr RBC label infant RBC survival study ) , infants weigh less 1,500 g birth often survive , RBC survival data exist today 's small , frequently transfuse infant whose birth weight 500-1,000 g. Specific Aims : Specific Aim # 1 : To develop vitro validate vivo adult capability biotinylating RBCs 5 discrete density measurable flow cytometry . These five RBC biotin density label use Specific Aims # 2 , 3 , 4 simultaneously determine RBC survival multiple , distinct population transfuse RBCs premature infant . Specific Aim # 2 . To determine whether RBC survival donor placental RBCs significantly longer adjust mathematical modeling . We anticipate unmodeled value substantially underestimate RBC survival . Specific Aim # 3 . To compare long-term RBC survival result transfuse adult donor fetal/placental RBCs anemic newborn infant . We anticipate rapid growth fetus result great stress erythropoiesis lead intrinsic RBC `` defect '' shorten RBC survival compare adult donor RBCs . Specific Aim # 4 . To quantify effect storage model adjust RBC survival adult donor RBCs transfuse newborn infant . We anticipate storage donor RBCs alter RBC survival . Study Design : The study propose build biotinylation mathematical modeling method research group develop accurately measure RBC survival without expose infant radioactivity . The biotin RBC labeling method well suit newborn infant permit simultaneous track multiple RBC population &lt; 10 ÂµL blood . Survival RBCs label multiple biotin density quantify use standard RBC survival parameter , ie , post-transfusion short-term 24 h RBC recovery long-term modeled RBC survival , ie , 50 100 % biotin-labeled RBCs disappear circulation . The latter two measurement calculate use required mathematical adjustment growth , laboratory phlebotomy loss , intervene RBC transfusion . Only Specific Aim # 4 Thrasher Foundation Abstract involve human infant study subject . Specific Aim # 4 ) USE THE RBC BIOTINYLATION AND MATHEMATICAL MODELING METHODOLOGIES VALIDATED IN ADULT SHEEP AND NEWBORN LAMBS TO ACCURATELY MEASURE POST-TRANSFUSION RBC KINETICS IN ANEMIC NEWBORN INFANTS TRANSFUSED WITH FRESH AUTOLOGOUS , FRESH ALLOGENEIC AND STORED ALLOGENEIC RBCS . The use biotin , non-toxic , non-radioactive B vitamin , distinguish among different RBC population simultaneously flow cytometry critical accomplishing aim hold clear advantage RBC label method safety accuracy . In utilize four Specific Aims achieve goal establish effective transfusion practice identify optimal RBC transfusion product use anemic INFANTS .</detailed_description>
