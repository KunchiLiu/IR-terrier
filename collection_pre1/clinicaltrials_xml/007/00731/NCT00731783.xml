	<brief_title>Staphylococcus Aureus Decolonization Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) uniformly associate hospital-acquired infection ; however , MRSA strain emerge thrive outside hospital environment , cause significant morbidity mortality among immunocompetent individual , lead designation community-acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( CA-MRSA ) . CA-MRSA become major source morbidity mortality pediatric population . An important prerequisite S. aureus infection may nasal carriage organism . A variety decolonization strategy use infection prophylaxis , primarily patient undergo hemodialysis surgery , vary result . However , publish randomized eradication trial evaluate decolonization prevention CA-MRSA infection immunocompetent child outpatient set . While transmission CA-MRSA within household report , contribution recurrent CA-MRSA infection among household member undetermined . The investigator hypothesize spread CA-MRSA among household member lead recolonization failure decolonization child undergo eradication effort . Specific Aim : In pediatric patient present MRSA skin soft tissue infection , compare effectiveness decolonization measure perform entire household comparison measure direct index patient alone . The investigator conduct randomize , control trial test hypothesis decolonization measure perform entire household , specifically application intranasal mupirocin ointment bath chlorhexidine liquid soap , addition education basic hygiene intervention , twice effective eradicate CA-MRSA carriage index patient measure perform index patient .</detailed_description>
