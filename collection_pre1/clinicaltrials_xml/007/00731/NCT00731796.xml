	<brief_summary>This study design two Phases . In phase 1 , Functional Outcome Measure test determine validity reliability three population , subject stroke visual field defect , subject stroke visual field defect , lastly subject stroke visual field defect . The second phase employ amend version functional outcome measure administer two group subject . The first group subject subject diagnose visual field defect retrochiasmatic insult perform vision restoration therapy . The second group similar diagnosis first undergo vision restoration therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing Functional Outcome Measure Those With Visual Field Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct 18 month conduct two phase : Phase 1 In first phase , determine validity reliability Functional Outcome Measure apply Functional Outcome Measure 20 subject homonymous visual field defect ( VFD ) due stoke , 20 stroke case without visual field defect 20 normal individual . They ask perform Functional Outcome Measure second time within follow 1-2 week order evaluate test-retest reliability . The expectation without VFD ( stroke normal individual ) good excellent result Functional Outcome Measure , VFD abnormal result , thus reflect ability instrument record impairment present VFD . In addition , anticipate result similar retesting , ensure test-retest reliability . An interim analysis determine instrument valid component correlate magnitude visual field loss ( measure High Resolution perimetry ) . Once validation instrument accomplish , functional outcome measure amend suggested analysis include item correlate well VFD . The functional outcome measure administer either NovaVision , Inc. office ( normal individual ) cooperate medical center ( stroke patient without visual field defect ) . Phase 2 In second phase , amend version Functional Outcome Instrument administer individual VFD . Two group study : 100 case perform Vision Restoration Therapy ( VRT ) , 50 control . The latter group include 20 patient VFD study Phase 1 . Both group undergo visual field test high resolution perimetry , complete Functional Outcome Measure 4 occasion : twice within 2 week interval baseline , three month , 6-7 month , one group complete therapy time . Visual field test ( high resolution perimetry ) administer cooperate medical center . While patient undergo VRT perform functional outcome measure center VRT device home , control perform functional outcome measure medical center , n't access VRT device home .</detailed_description>
