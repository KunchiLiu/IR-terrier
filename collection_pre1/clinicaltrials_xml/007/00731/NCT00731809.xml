Such increased uptake describe neoplastic lesion also inflammatory lesion . In condition , uptake correlated local stimulation tumor necrosis factor , monocyte prim activation . A physiologic variable uptake may observe bowel , especially cecum , limited use PET inflammatory bowel disease . The advantage combine PET CT device lead significant improvement interpretation bowel area , greatly reduce number false-positive finding gastrointestinal tract .</brief_summary>
