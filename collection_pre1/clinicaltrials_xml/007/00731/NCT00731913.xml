	<brief_title>A Comparison Monosyn Monocryl Sutures Surgical Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physicians use suture close wound least 4,000 year . Archaeological record ancient Egypt show Egyptians use linen animal sinew close wound . In ancient India , physician use pincer beetle ant staple wound shut . They cut insect ' body , leave jaw ( staple ) place . Other natural material use close wound include flax , hair , grass , cotton , silk , pig bristle , animal gut . The fundamental principle wound closure change little 4,000 year . Successful closure wound involve surgical technique couple knowledge physical characteristic handle suture needle . The selection proper suture material closing surgical defect important wound healing , minimize infection , achieve optimal cosmetic functional result . A great deal progress make since Egyptian time regard suture material manufacture process . Today , suture available wide variety characteristic , configuration , manipulability , coefficient friction , solubility , strength , immunogenic property . Yet , suture currently rather crudely classify base numeric scale accord diameter tensile strength ; descend 10 1 , descend 1-0 12-0 . This study aim explore factor important surgeon choose suture via evaluate surgeon preference two type synthetic , absorbable , monofilament suture : Monosyn Monocryl . We hope initiate nuanced exploration suture characteristic influence surgeon preference , beyond filament type size , maker suture may better report represent factor .</detailed_description>
