	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose irinotecan treat Asian patient solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Treating Asian Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerate dose irinotecan hydrochloride accord genotype status Asian patient solid tumor . Secondary - To investigate pharmacokinetics irinotecan hydrochloride metabolites SN-38 SN-38G . - To evaluate time tumor response , response duration , time progression patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord genotype status ( UGT1A1*28 v UGT1A1*6 ) Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV weekly 3 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacogenetic , pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic study .</detailed_description>
