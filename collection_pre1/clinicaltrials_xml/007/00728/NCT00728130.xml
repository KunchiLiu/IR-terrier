	<detailed_description>Hypothesis 1 . The submandibular gland lymphatic organ usually remain uninvolved head neck cancer despite presence metastatic disease lymph nod surround . 2 . All lymph node submandibular triangle remove without resection submandibular gland . Study Design 1 . A prospective control study . 2 . A neck dissection least ipsilateral sub-level 1B performed patient . In case oral cavity tumor , 15 minute prior surgery , 1ml Lymphazurin® blue dye inject 4 quadrant around primary site . The dissection perform 3 stage . In first stage lymph node group lie either lateral , anterior , posterior , superior , inferior submandibular gland , within anatomical boundary level 1B , dissect . The submandibular gland leave intact portion procedure . Next , submandibular gland remove . Lastly , remain fibrofatty tissue lie deep submandibular gland within confines level IB remove . Each lymph node group , submandibular gland , fibrofatty tissue lie deep submandibular gland , submit pathological assessment separate container . 3 . The following end-points measure : number lymph node identify within lymph node group , number lymph node locate within submandibular gland , number lymph node within fibrofatty content lie deep submandibular gland . The presence absence carcinoma within assessed node document , well extracapsular spread . A good understanding frequency submandibular gland involvement may lead refined treatment strategy head neck cancer , possibly spare removal submandibular gland potentially improve long term side effect therapy .</detailed_description>
