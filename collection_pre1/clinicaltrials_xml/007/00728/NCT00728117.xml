	<brief_title>Feeding During Ibuprofen Indomethacin Treatment Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize control multi-center clinical trial determine whether low birth weight infant receive feeding indomethacin ibuprofen treatment patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) . Many neonatologists withhold feed premature infant receive indomethacin ibuprofen therapy PDA concern drug alter intestinal blood flow permeability . However , establish study show feed medical treatment lead bowel injury . At time , study suggest withhold feeding premature infant may lead intestinal atrophy injury , lead increase difficulty feeding initiate re-started . Thus , multi-center study evaluate whether feed infant indomethacin ibuprofen therapy improve feed tolerance measure number episode feed intolerance number day require attain full feeding .
