	<brief_summary>In summary , CHILLAS study first multicenter study perform Chinese population use patient-level analysis compare effect safety intensive statin therapy moderate statin therapy . Therefore , determine whether `` low better '' , , whether LDL cholesterol lower level approximately 100mg/dl provide benefit inferior LDL cholesterol lower much low level ; examine role inflammatory marker predict cardiac event response statin therapy ; evaluate effect statin therapy regression coronary atherosclerosis use IVUS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The CHILLAS study plan evaluate whether intensive treatment statins 2 year result reduction cardiovascular event patient ACS . A total 1,600 patient randomly assign receive intensive statin therapy ( atorvastatin , 20 40 mg/d , equivalent dose statin ) moderate therapy ( atorvastatin , 10 mg/d , equivalent dose statin ) . Both group receive dietary counseling . Over 2-year follow-up period , primary outcome measure time occurrence cardiac death , nonfatal acute myocardial infarction , revascularization either percutaneous coronary intervention coronary-artery bypass grafting , document unstable angina severe heart failure require emergency hospitalization , stroke . The planned duration December 2006 December 2009 .</detailed_description>
