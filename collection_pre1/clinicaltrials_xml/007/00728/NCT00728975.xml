	<brief_summary>The project 's primary purpose establish network Hospice Palliative Care setting use common consistent method assess document bowel function order able carry future collaborative study constipation treatment . The secondary goal gather normative data current bowel care function outcomes current treatment use determine sample size calculation future control trial bowel management protocol . In order complete goal project require thorough assessment current nursing practice regard bowel care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Bowel Research Collaborative Data Tracking System Implementation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Site assessment : Each site assess current bowel assessment documentation method , current bowel management strategy . Clinical practice leader ( nurse physician ) interview , many nurse contact ask complete brief questionnaire bowel care site , focus group hold order allow staff input . A retrospective chart review carry include least 30 patient establish current documentation standard outcome . The impact bowel care nursing practice assess . Intervention : As result assessment sit collaboration site leader , research team devise common reporting documentation system enable systematic collection bowel outcomes data . It intend Victoria Bowel Performance Scale introduce , combination reporting tool specific bowel management . The tool may vary site site depend context care , example inpatient unit differ requirement outpatient clinic . However goal require outcome data retrievable chart setting consistent , complete reliable way . Evaluation : Medical nursing staff survey way initial assessment ( interview , questionnaire focus group ) , assess performance acceptability modify report process . A second chart review undertaken least 30 patient pass service . Outcomes chart review communicate back care provider order give feedback quality bowel care provide . Any modification data track system make end project system acceptable site function effectively , allow network collaborate site proceed next step : clinical trial different bowel care treatment . Demographic data record require determine comparability cohort respect risk constipation include follow variable . - Age - Gender - Palliative Performance Status ( PPSv2 ) admission - Diagnosis ( cancer , tumour type ) - Major comorbid diagnose - Reason admission - Presence absence abdominal cancer - Presence absence ascites - Radiotherapy admission ( yes , abdomen ) - Medications take admission - Duration admission - Number day bowel protocol - Discharge death The primary outcome measure bowel function patient proportion day least one bowel movement day , proportion patient bowel movement least 40 % least 50 % day . The secondary outcome variable study use enema , suppository lactulose , report cramp and/or diarrhoea . Diarrhoea define either passage watery stool least day , 3 bowel movement day . These outcome variable use docusate study . Sites group accord type setting ( hospice , PCU , home etc ) . Sites similar patient combine statistical analysis ( example two Vancouver residential hospice patient refer common process assign accord bed availability ) . Acceptability BPS assess combination questionnaire focus group staff site elect pilot review result initial assessment . Their response analyse use qualitative methodology . Staff also ask end study whether would prefer continue use BPS routine clinical assessment revert previous method . The utility BPS suitable outcome measure clinical trial bowel management treatment explore correlate single item BPS score primary secondary outcome variable . As score BPS essentially composite multiple outcome variable , ( bowel movement frequency , consistency , degree sphincter control associate symptom cramp etc . ) anticipate BPS provide least outcome information multiple individual variable , rarely fully document . We hope BPS provide patient-centred useful information guide laxative treatment , tool centre around individual 's `` normal '' bowel habit , rather rely arbitrarily define norm . Data sit able pooled analysis .</detailed_description>
