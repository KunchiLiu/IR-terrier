	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common form malignancy affect woman worldwide , approximately 178,480 new case invasive breast cancer 62,030 new case situ breast cancer expect United States ( US ) 2007 . Approximately 40,460 woman expect die breast cancer come year , make disease second lead cause cancer-related mortality among woman ( trail cancer lung bronchus ) . However , thanks part recent advance treatment , mortality rate associate breast cancer decline consistently since 1990 . Surgical resection treatment may particularly benefit patient whose disease identify prior metastasis ; 5-year survival rate patient diagnose locoregionally advanced disease 83 % . However , woman distant metastases diagnosis much poor outlook , 5-year survival rate 26 % median survival approximately 2 year . Treatment advance disease may include first-line chemotherapy utilizing anthracycline ( eg , doxorubicin epirubicin ) , antibody therapy , limited surgery , taxanes , cytotoxic agent . As complete response rare , treatment generally employ curative effort prolong life provide symptom palliation . Approximately two-thirds breast cancer positive expression estrogen receptor.For patient whose tumor positive receptor progesterone receptor , preferred first-line treatment comprises blockade estradiol synthesis hormone receptor activity use aromatase inhibitor antiestrogen agent . Although endocrine therapy useful well-tolerated , patient respond form treatment 12-18 month develop refractory disease . New therapy able provide additional benefit patient hormone receptor-positive , antiestrogen-refractory , advanced metastatic breast cancer require .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient histologically cytologicallyconfirmed invasive breast cancer , time study entry either stage III ( locally advance ) disease amenable curative therapy stage IV disease . Histological confirmation recurrent/metastatic disease require clinical evidence stage IV disease recurrence available Tumors positive estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PgR ) , ( ie , 10 % infiltrate cancer cell exhibit nuclear stain ER and/or PgR ; positive biochemical test result also acceptable ) The patient receive prior antiestrogen therapy : 1 . With least one antiestrogen agent ( without ovarian suppression ) administer ≥ 3 month adjuvant metastatic setting ; 2 . Experienced disease progression within 12 month receive last dose endocrine therapy The patient postmenopausal and/or meet least one follow criterion : 1 . Age ≥ 18 year intact uterus amenorrhea ≥ 12 month , estradiol and/or folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) value postmenopausal range 2 . History bilateral oophorectomy 3 .
