	<brief_summary>Salvia hispanic ( Salba ) postulate increase satiety . This study determine optimal amount Salba well whether liquid solid enrich product produce maximum satiety . The result gauge effectiveness Salba weight loss program . The study randomize , double-blind crossover design include 10 test meal capillary blood sample perform glucose insulin analysis ( determine blood glucose response blood insulin response ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Salvia Hispanica-Enriched Foods Glycemic Insulinemic Responses Subjective Satiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There many factor involve ability food suppress appetite , instance fiber , fat protein content food . The novel whole grain Salvia hispanica may significantly lower appetite compare refine carbohydrate whole grain composition . First , Salvia hispanica 's high fiber content may help low postprandial glycemia . Whole grain much high fiber refine carbohydrate . High fiber food think satiate low energy density delay gastric emptying , cause glucose release slowly circulation . This , turn , hypothesize increase satiety prevent sudden drop blood glucose level , would normally trigger hunger . Another mechanism fiber may promote satiety , independent glycemic response , secretion gut hormone signal fullness . Furthermore , Salvia hispanica may satiate whole grain due high fat protein content . Protein fat also prolong satiety due mechanism delay gastric empty secretion gut hormone . Results preliminary study confirm satiate effect Salvia hispanica , demonstrate grain induces increase subjective satiety reduce postprandial glycemia . It presume food satiating , decrease subsequent intake food hunger suppress . A low caloric intake , turn , would help promote weight loss . Salvia hispanica may also encourage weight loss via another mechanism . Preliminary study suggest grain lower glycemic index value white flour . Consumption low-GI food compare high-GI food suggest reduce obesity discourage fat deposition promote fat oxidation . Thus , Salvia hispanica could potentially promote weight loss reduce hunger amount body fat store . In order study Salvia hispanica 's ability promote weight loss , feasibility study must first do determine amount optimal satiety also whether enrich product satiate liquid solid form .</detailed_description>
