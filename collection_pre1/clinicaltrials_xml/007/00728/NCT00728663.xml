	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Cetuximab may also stop growth prostate cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving docetaxel together cetuximab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give docetaxel together cetuximab see well work treat patient metastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess efficacy safety docetaxel cetuximab patient docetaxel-resistant hormone-refractory prostate cancer OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cetuximab IV weekly docetaxel IV day 1 ( 3-week course ) day 1 , 8 , 15 ( 4-week course ) . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
