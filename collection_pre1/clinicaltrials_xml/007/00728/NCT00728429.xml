	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Aerobic exercise may help prevent side effect cause chemotherapy help improve heart health . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study side effect aerobic exercise see well work patient receive chemotherapy cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerobic Exercise Patients Receiving Chemotherapy Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine patient cancer exercise safely routinely , supervision , receive anthracycline chemotherapy . - To determine magnitude change peak ventilatory oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) completion anthracycline chemotherapy concurrent exercise versus without exercise patient cancer . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 intervention arm . - Arm I ( exercise ) : Patients undergo supervise aerobic exercise ( walk bicycle ) 3 day week concurrently standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy approximately 18-24 week . - Arm II ( non-exercise ) : Patients receive standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy approximately 18-24 week . Patients undergo peak ventilatory oxygen uptake ( VO_2 ) exercise bike test gas exchange analysis baseline 2 week completion anthracycline-based chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
