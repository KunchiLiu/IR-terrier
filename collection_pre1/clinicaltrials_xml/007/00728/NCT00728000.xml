	<brief_title>Phase II Study Of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy In Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although surgery curative modality pancreatic adenocarcinoma , majority patient ( ~80 % ) unresectable presentation . The use multimodality approach may crucial method improve dismal survival rate patient pancreatic cancer . A logical tactic use neoadjuvant cytotoxic agent target drug facilitate resectability .</detailed_description>
