	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-dose , design investigate safety , tolerability efficacy NA-1 , peptide design reduce ischemic brain damage . Up 200 male female patient undergo endovascular repair brain aneurysm dose 2.60 mg/kg NA-1 placebo 10 minute intravenous infusion completion endovascular procedure Day 1 study period . Subjects undergo interim procedure Days 2-4 end-of study procedure Day 30 . Standard safety criterion analyse . Efficacy endpoint include ability NA-1 : 1 ) reduce volume ischemic embolic stroke , 2 ) reduce number ischemic embolic stroke , 3 ) reduce vascular cognitive impairment , 4 ) reduce frequency large stroke induce endovascular procedure . The plasma concentration NA-1 also analyze .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria A diagnosis rupture unruptured brain aneurysm deem suitable repair neuroendovascular technique involve intraluminal occlusion detachable platinum coil , stentassisted coiling , pipeline stent , balloonassisted coiling , cover stent , neckbridge device , recoil , retreatment previously coiled/treated aneurysm . There restriction adjunctive device . For patient ruptured aneurysm , endovascular repair must take place within 72 hour ictal haemorrhage . If aneurysm rupture , patient Grade IIII World Federation Neurological Surgeons ( WFNS ) grade scale subarachnoid hemorrhage . If patient intubate alert able follow command ( least 2step command ) , keep intubated neurological status ( i.e. , WFNS Grade IV V ) , patient consider WFNS Grade III eligible trial . Absence ongoing ischemic symptom transient ischemic attack , minor stroke , strokeinevolution , clinical evidence cerebral vasospasm within 2 week prior randomization . ( If CT scan , cerebral angiogram , image perform 2 week prior randomization show radiological vasospasm deem treat physician potentially clinically significant , subject exclude . ) Brain MRI imaging ( DWI FLAIR sequence ) within 2 week prior endovascular aneurysm repair procedure detail Section 8.2 . Imaging must demonstrate focal ischemic stroke define new region restrict diffusion and/or focal area reduce perfusion relative mean transit time ( rMTT ) relative time peak ( rTTP ) map Male female minimum age 18 year day enrolment . Female subject childbearing potential : Negative pregnancy test . After enrolment , blood drawn woman childbearing potential confirmatory test pregnancy evaluate serum BhCG test . The definition nonchildbearing potential include following : Surgically sterile ( e.g. , hysterectomy without oophorectomy ; fallopian tube ligation ; endometrial ablation ) , least 30 day prior signature Informed Consent form At least 5 year postmenopause ( i.e. , 6 year post last menstrual period ) , menopause confirm folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) test . Nonsurgically sterile female female undocumented postmenopausal status must willing use medically approve method birth control 3 month completion dose . Nonsurgically sterile male male partner childbearing potential must willing use condom spermicide 3 month completion dose . Body weight less equal 180 kg . Normal abnormal clinically significant finding nonneurological physical examination 12lead ECG PQ PR interval less equal 210 msec ; In unruptured aneurysm case , QTc interval le 450 msec male 470 msec female . For ruptured aneurysm case , QTc interval restrict . vital sign blood pressure 80180/50100 mm Hg , body temperature le equal 38.5oC Informed consent availability subject entire study period willingness subject adhere protocol requirement , evidence sign Informed Consent Form . Exclusion Criteria Dissecting mycotic brain aneurysm . Fusiform atherosclerotic intracerebral aneurysm may eligible trial endovascular treatment plan goal exclusion aneurysm circulation . Planned endovascular vessel sacrifice primary modality aneurysm treatment . Known history lifethreatening allergic reaction medication . Chronic renal disease define baseline serum creatinine &gt; 150 umol/L . Women pregnant , positive urine blood ( Î²hCG ) pregnancy test . Women breastfeed . Any clinically significant psychiatric psychological disease , would preclude patient complete protocol . Premorbid ( estimate ) modify Rankin scale score great 2 . Previous serious traumatic brain injury would preclude patient complete protocol preclude MRI analysis small stroke . Patients know HIV infection . Patients unable MRI scan reason . Participation clinical trial investigational drug within 30 day precede study . Previous participation ENACT trial ( e.g , , treat prior aneurysm ) , participation another trial involve NA1 prior receipt NA1 . Any medical condition site investigator deems would put patient excessive risk participation study expect life expectancy le 1 year would result inability collect clinical outcome 30 day .</criteria>
