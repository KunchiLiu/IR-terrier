	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine proportion patient esophageal eosinophilic infiltration objective ( measurable ) evidence gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . This study also do see patient eosinophilic esophagitis ( EE ) GERD would receive relief take medication Nexium steroid call Pulmicort . The study also evaluate accuracy pH monitoring ( acid exposure ) within esophagus predictor endoscopic , histological symptomatic response patient EE .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypotheses : 1 . There subset patient diagnosis EE also GERD . 2 . Patients EE GERD respond symptomatically histologically aggressive gastric acid suppression proton pump inhibitor monotherapy . 3 . Swallowed budesonide suspension effective treating patient EE evidence GERD . Participants randomize base result 24 hour pH study , determine average percent time distal esophagus expose pH less 4 . Subjects positive pH result randomize esomeprazole randomize budesonide , negative pH result . Studies interpret single gastroenterologist experience read esophageal pH study . The percent time pH monitor detect pH le 4 recorded esophageal pH le 4 4 % great study time consider abnormal . Note : pH measure acidity alkalinity ( low number acid , high number alkaline ) . Those subject GERD ( positive pH result ) receive gastric acid-suppressing medication ( esomeprazole 40 mg , twice daily ) 6 week . Subjects GERD ( negative pH result ) treat corticosteroid design coat esophagus ( budesonide suspension 1 mg twice daily ) six week . Response treatment assess esophageal histology symptom .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients ages 1880 . 2 . Patients carry diagnosis Eosinophilic Esophagitis ( EE ) base esophageal biopsy obtain within 18 month prior enrollment great 15 eosinophil ( eos ) per high power field ( hpf ) ( 400 X magnification ) . 3 . Patients moderate , severe , severe problem swallow . 1 . Patients currently treat EE . 2 . Patients use topical systemic corticosteroid therapy reason past 4 week . 3 . Patients treat acidsuppressing medication ( Proton Pump Inhibitor H2 receptor antagonist ) within 4 week prior enrollment . 4 . Patients known allergy hypersensitivity protonpump inhibitor corticosteroid . 5 . Patients contraindication procurement biopsy include patient know bleed disorder , history bleeding diathesis , currently use warfarin clopidogrel . 6 . Patients contraindication performance esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) include previous cardiopulmonary arrest endoscopic procedure . 7 . Patients contraindication performance ambulatory impedance 24hour pH test include patient oropharyngeal abnormality would prohibit safe passage transnasal catheter patient currently use warfarin , history bleeding disorder bleed diatheses . 8 . Patients pregnant .</criteria>
