	<brief_title>The Correlations Between HPV L1-Specific Immunologic Responses Cervical Cancer Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ( CIN ) Patients Their Prognosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical cancer frequent neoplasm woman Taiwan world . Cervical cancer affect half million woman year result 200,000 worldwide also influence 2,700 woman 1,000 woman die cervical cancer year Taiwan . There strong evidence suggest cancer 100 % attributable infection certain type human papillomavirus ( HPV ) ; fact , World Health Organization ( WHO ) recently recognize cancer cause HPV . There around 100 different HPV-types , around 40 type infect anogenital tract cause cervical lesion cervical cancer call High Risk HPV ( i.e. , HR-HPV-16 , -18 , -31 , -33 , -58 ) . From recent year , compel evidence infection human papillomavirus ( HPV ) major etiologic factor development cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) cervical carcinoma . As virus induced disease , adequate immune response likely play key role clearance HPV infection HPV-related lesion . This assumption bear epidemiological study animal model . Immune compromise patient HIV infect woman , organ transplant recipient , patient suffer forms malignancy , high risk develop CIN lesion invasive cervical cancer . Moreover , several study establish existence natural HPV-specific immunity human . Immune responses host indeed critical virus-related infectious disease . The immune response HPV antigens Human leukocyte antigen restrict . Consequently , HLA class I II phenotype may correlate effective immune response HPV associate cervical lesion . Differences recognition foreign antigen , contribute allele HLA class I II locus , might propose affect risk develop cervical cancer . Studies different group association certain HLA allele susceptibility , protection CIN lesion cervical carcinoma , reveal vary conclusion warrant research . Most potentially oncogenic , persistent , long-term HPV infection induce antibody response virus protein detect ELISA test good indicator past well current infection chronic active infection , associate presence cervical lesion high risk acquire cervical cancer . In fact , report woman seropositive HPV-16 present high risk develop cervical carcinoma seronegative woman . L1-viral capsid proteins one target antibodies induced persistent HPV genital infection . The L1 protein represent 90 % total protein surface virus . This protein able assemble , form virus-like particle ( VLPs ) . VLPs , mainly type 16 , broadly use study antibody response induce genital HPVinfection . The VLP-antibody presence stable time , correlate number sexual partner , associate persistent infection , viral load , development neoplasic lesion ; rarely find patient suffer transitory infection . Seropositivity occur frequently patient progress CIN III invasive cancer suffer CIN I CIN II antibody response significantly high woman higher viral load lower viral load . Prospective study show 70-90 % HPV-16 infected woman seroconverted 6 18 month HPV DNA detect rarely occurs patient detect transient HPV DNA . However , serological study show 20-50 % woman suffer HPV-associated lesion , HPV DNA presence , present detectable level anti-VLP antibody ; part due lack optimized test fact antibody reactivity type-specific virus . An optimized VLP-based ELISA test recently report show 93 % sensitivity 98.5 % specificity discriminate positive negative control serum . However , report evaluate antibody response patient HPV-infected cervical lesion prognosis patient . So present proposal , would like examine anti-L1 antibody various HPV type among Taiwanese woman HPV-related CIN cervical cancer . The purpose proposal 1 ) address immunologic response HPV CIN cervical cancer patient . , 2 ) elucidate correlation immunologic response HPV disease severity cervical cancer. , 3 ) evaluate correlation immunologic response HPV prognosis cervical cancer patient . The samples patient ' serum collect day surgery . 2 . The serum sample freezedon -200C analyze . 3 . The serum sample ship Lab . Merck company US . 4 . HPV Serologic Assay A competitive radioimmunoassay develop Merck Research Laboratories use perform quantitate serum HPV- 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 58 , 59 , 68 antibody Merck Research Laboratories ( 12 ) . Results read standard curve , correct dilution , report arbitrary unit ( milli-Merck Units , mMU per milliliter ) . A fixed cutoff 5.9 mMU per milliliter ( derive repeatedly test panel positive negative sample standard curve ) use determine HPV-6 , 11 , 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 58 , 59 , 68 serologic status woman .</detailed_description>
