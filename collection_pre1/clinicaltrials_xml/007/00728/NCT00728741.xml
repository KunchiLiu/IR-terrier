	<brief_summary>This study locate area brain help people devise action plan carry complex task require use strategy . The ability plan strategically impaired patient stroke affect front part brain . This study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) examine activity different area brain formulation execution plan . Right-handed healthy volunteer 18 60 year age may eligible study . Participants come NIH Clinical Center four five time complete follow procedure : Visit 1 - Screening - Medical history - Physical neurological examination Visit 2 - MRI brain scan ( one do within past year ) MRI - This test use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image brain . The scanner metal cylinder surround magnetic field . The subject lie table slide scanner , wear earplug muffle loud noise occur scan . Visits 3 5 - Task training session two fMRI scan Functional MRI involve take MRI scan subject performs task order learn change brain region involve performance task . Subjects train two task ( see ) perform task MRI scanner . - Task 1 : The subject press computer key response direction arrows show computer screen . The key press accord give set rule subject taught . - Task 2 : This task similar task 1 , subject also ask remember certain previous action response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Efficient behavior require ability generalize previous experience . This achieved behavioral strategy . We use many behavioral strategy ; strategy strict S-R association -stop RED light- ; others modifiable -balancing skill ballerina becomes useful rock climbing- serve abstract strategy enable solve problem . Strategy use common behavioral repertoire . A strategy define set computation associate act plan direct overall operation movement involve task . A behavioral strategy conscious behave primate spontaneously adopt order maximize reward well characterized literature . These call `` Repeat-Stay '' / '' Change-Shift '' strategy , show associated prefrontal neuronal activity multi-unit intra-cortical recording , clearly indicate special role play prefrontal cortex compute strategy use . It important understand human brain computes process strategy . This study aim understand activation pattern , neuronal connectivity human brain engage task require strategy . We hypothesize application strategy solve task would show specifically significantly increase Blood Oxygenation Dependant ( BOLD ) signal , particularly fronto-polar cortex ( PFp ) , ventral orbitofrontal prefrontal cortex ( PFV+o ) human brain . STUDY POPULATION The two experiment describe protocol may recruit 61 ( 6 pilot study ) adult healthy volunteer . DESIGN The study consist functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) . The fMRI consist two separate experiment : ( 1 ) strategy experiment ( 2 ) memory control experiment . Data analyze separately part experiment : Responses task collect data ( response time , accuracy rate ) search statistically significant difference use linear contrast ANOVA model . The image fMRI data analyze statistically significant functional activation use implementation General Linear Model ( GLM ) ( R. Turner et al. , 1998 ; K. J. Friston et al. , 2005 ) Statistical Parametric Mapping ( SPM ) . OUTCOME MEASURES We propose acquire response data ( response time , error rate ) , functional brain activation data use fMRI . Therefore , would two outcome measure . From response data evaluate statistically significant difference response time , error rate , learn curve . From BOLD fMRI data , main outcome would task specific neural activation would regress behavioral task General Linear Model . These measure understand human brain use strategy complex task performance . This lay foundation understand capable generalizing experience specific instance . Such knowledge also improve understand various aspect movement genesis , likely eventually shed light various movement disorder include psychogenic movement disorder chorea among others .</detailed_description>
