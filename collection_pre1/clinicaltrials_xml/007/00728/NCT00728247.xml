	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Kinematic parameter use monitor change three-dimensional head movement Manual Therapy treatment . Subjects level cervical dysfunction examine experienced Osteopathic physician . During clinical assessment cervical lateral flexion , kinematic data record . Subjects treat use manual therapy technique kinematic data record set interval treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Objective Kinematic Correlates Palpatory Diagnosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The physician providing treatment use , depend professional judgment subject , one four treatment modality : ( 1 ) soft-tissue stretch , ( 2 ) myofascial release , ( 3 ) muscle energy , ( 4 ) functional ( indirect ) method . These modality standard care practice osteopathic manual medicine , teach Osteopathic curriculum , practice day Michigan State University Clinical Center . After initial treatment , immediate follow-up kinematic test collect 3-D motion data . Then , subject return subsequent kinematic assessment : 24 hour post treatment , 48 hour post treatment seven day post treatment . At seven day mark , subject evaluate initial assessment physician use professional judgment determine subject would benefit second treatment . If , process treatment kinematic assessment would occur second time , kinematic assessment 24 hour post treatment , 48 hour post treatment seven day post treatment . A maximum two treatment session perform .</detailed_description>
