We hypothesize insertion sacrospinous ligament ischial spine could source pain woman long-lasting low back pain beginning pregnancy might therefore target therapy . The woman include randomized accord computer generate random allocation sequence , block size four , conceal investigator study closure . A physiotherapist perform assessment baseline follow four week treatment . The assessment consist questionnaire clinical examination back pelvis . Participants randomize receive injection treatment either compound 1 ml triamcinolone 20mg/ml ( Lederspan ) , Meda AB , Solna , Sweden ) 1 ml lidocaine hydrochloride 10mg/ml ( Xylocain ) , Astra Zeneca , Södertälje , Sweden ) 0.99 ml saline solution 9mg/ml , 1 ml lidocaine hydrochloride 0.01 ml fat emulsion ( Intralipid ) , Fresenius Kabi , Uppsala , Sweden ) , latter make solution opalescent Lederspan .
