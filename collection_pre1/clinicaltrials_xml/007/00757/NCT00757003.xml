	<brief_summary>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH : Endovascular stent-graft repair aortic pathology minimally-invasive alternative open surgery may decrease morbidity mortality , particularly high risk patient . Optimal patient selection , base pathology anatomy , define . Technically successful implantation require adequate assessment pathology anatomy , development execution novel delicate procedure resolve pathology minimize morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Evaluate Safety Efficacy GORE TAG Thoracic Endoprosthesis Treatment Thoracic Aortic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESCRIPTION : There maximum 100 patient treat new device . You evaluate doctor determine able participate research study . This evaluation include review medical history , physical examination , special x-ray . These special x-ray call CT scan angiograms . Your doctor explain test do . A CT scan special x-ray allows doctor see size shape aorta artery . An angiogram us catheter ( hollow tube ) place artery . Both test use dye see x-ray see blood flow aorta surround artery ; CT scan inject vein , angiogram inject catheter artery . These test would conduct whether participate research study . Your doctor use type test determine eligible participate research study part follow-up care . Currently two aortic stent graft manufacture W.L . Gore &amp; Associates approve FDA experimental use . Your doctor determine device appropriate treat condition .</detailed_description>
