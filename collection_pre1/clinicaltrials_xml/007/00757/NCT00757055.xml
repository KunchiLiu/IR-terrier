	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether medicine ivabradine , novel drug slow heart rate favourable effect patient diastolic heart failure . Ivabradine specific heart rate-lowering agent . It licence treat patient angina intolerant agent beta blocker whose angina adequately control . It show prolong exercise tolerance patient reduce frequency chest pain . Its mechanism action felt purely due reduce heart rate , much 10 beat per minute rest , well reduce heart rate response exercise . Patients diastolic heart failure often complain breathlessness exertion relate stiffness lack compliance heart i.e . heart fail relax rapidly enough allow fill blood heart beat . This may result high pressure heart chamber back lung may experience breathlessness . There little evidence specific therapy benefit patient type heart failure besides treat coexist problem high blood pressure angina . By slow heart rate ivabradine , heart would longer time fill exercise would make effective . This slow heart rate may therefore relieve breathlessness experienced activity walk shop flight stair etc .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>If Channel Blockade With Ivabradine Patients With Diastolic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Almost half patient heart failure ( HF ) preserve systolic function ( PSHF ) heart failure normal ejection fraction ( HFNEF ) . Some valvular abnormality severe mitral aortic regurgitation , severe anaemia , thyrotoxicosis rarer tropical cause heart failure . However , majority PSHF often echocardiographic evidence impair diastolic function i.e . impaired relaxation increase stiffness . This diastolic dysfunction may relate age , hypertension ischaemia . There little evidence effective therapy large HF population despite randomised trial compare placebo ACE inhibitor i.e . perindopril PEP-HF angiotensin receptor blocker i.e . candesartan CHARM Preserved trial . There also ongoing study aldosterone antagonists diastolic heart failure i.e . eplerenone v placebo TOPCAT continue recruit . In absence strong evidence base , many physician treat patient drug slow heart rate , namely calcium channel blocker verapamil beta blocker . This effect prolong diastole filling time theoretically improve stroke volume thus reduce leave ventricular end diastolic pressure ( LVEDP ) resultant drop wall stress therefore less stimulus myocardial fibrosis exacerbate diastolic dysfunction impede compliance . Hypothesis : An alternative mechanism slow heart rate ivabradine , novel If channel blocker act purely sino atrial node mean heart rate lower 10 bpm angina patient . This may result improved diastolic filling could demonstrate echocardiography , low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , could determine measure E : E ' ratio use tissue Doppler technique , improve effort tolerance , estimate assess change distance walk 6 minute physician assessment use NYHA score well patient Global Assessment possibly well quality life , determine Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaires . Other theoretical improvement could degree stiffness fibrosis due reduce LV wall stress secondary longer filling time . This could assess use surrogate wall strain brain natruretic peptide ( BNP ) , wall stress measure strain rate image echocardiography .</detailed_description>
