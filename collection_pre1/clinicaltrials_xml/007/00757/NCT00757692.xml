	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Vandetanib ( ZD 6474 ) Combination With Bicalutamide Versus Bicalutamide Alone Patients With Chemotherapy Naive Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With advent PSA surveillance , many patient diagnose hormone refractory disease , PSA rise disease , asymptomatic , evidence metastatic disease . There standard care patient population . A standard treatment population addition non-steroidal anti androgen bicalutamide . PSA response rate ( define 50 % decrease ) report 20 % range bicalutamide . Even patient hormone refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) metastases cancer relate symptom , initiation chemotherapy controversial give palliative nature chemotherapy potential serious toxicity . These patient generally well enough undergo trial novel agent achieve adequate drug exposure , cytostatic effect apparent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must pathological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate Patients must biochemically recurrent disease metastatic disease asymptomatic minimally symptomatic ( total daily morphine dose &lt; 30mg.day ) curative therapy exists . Patients must document evidence od PSA progression receive androgen ablative therapy ( i.e . must hormone refractory ) . Progression define development new metastatic lesion , rise PSA define least two rise PSA least 1 week apart . If second PSA rising , thrid PSA require show increase ; , subsequent level must show increase . The third ( subsequent ) PSA confirm progression must within 2 week randomization . The PSA must = &gt; 2ug/L time study entry . ECOG performance status 0 1 Age = &gt; 18 year Patients must life expectancy least 12 week No Prior chemotherapy permissible hormone refractory disease . Chemotherapy may receive neoadjuvant adjuvant setting provide give 12 month prior registration . Hormone Therapy Prior hormone therapy form either medical surgical castration require . If patient receive medical androgen abalation castrate level testosterone ( 1.7nmol/L ) must present . Therapy LHRH agonist must continue prostate cancer patient already receive treatment time registration . If patient discontinue LHRH agonist , must restart castrate level testosterone must present . Prior use nonsteroidal antiandrogens ( include bicalutamide ) permit must discontinue 6 week prior registration . Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 4 week elapse last dose registration trial . Exceptions make limited field , single fraction palliative radiation bone . No concurrent treatment steriods unless steriods ingest 4 week prior commence study dose less equal equivalent prednisone 20mg per day . No concurrent experimental trial medication permit . No prior use VEGF/VEGFR EGFR target agent hormone refractory disease permit . Laboratory Requirements within 7 calendar day prior registration Hematology : haemoglobin &gt; = 100g/L neutrophil &gt; =1.5 x 10 ( 9 ) /L Platelets &gt; =100 x 10 ( 9 ) /L INR = &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal Biochemistry : AST , ALT = &lt; 1.5 x upperlimit normal Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal Baseline QTc ( Bazett 's ) &lt; 480msec determined average least 3 consecutive electrocardiogram ( ECG ) take within 510 min . Patient consent must obtain accord local institutional and/or University Research Ethic Board ( REB ) requirement . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Protocol treatment begin within 7 calendar day patient registration . Patients history invasive malignancy , except : adequately treat non melanoma skin cancer solid tumor curatively treat evidence disease 3 year . Patients know brain metastasis leptomemingeal disease exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurological dysfunction would confound evaluation nerologic adverse event . History allergic reaction and/or sensitivity attribute compound similar chemical biological composition Vandetanib agent use study . Other serious intercurrent illness medical condition might aggravate protocol treatment include ; myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry , congestive heart failure , unstable angina , cardiomyopathy , unstable ventricular arrhythmia , OTc ( Bazett 's ) &gt; 480msec Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic &gt; 160 , diatolic &gt; 100 ) Uncontrolled psychotic disorder , serious infection , peptic ulcer disease , history bleed diathesis Upper gasrtointerstinal condition would preclude compliance oral medication Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat Marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , HIV positive patient receive combination antretroviral therapy exclude study possible risk lethal infection additionally possible pharmacokinetic interaction Vandetanib . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients require escalate amount narcotic therapy control pain e.g . morphine equivalent dose &gt; 30mg/day ) since patient would appropriately offer systemic chemotherapy Patients require therapeutic anticoagulation warfarin . Patients require follow medication : concomittant use warfarin , Class 1A antiarrythmics ( e.g. , quinidine , procainamide , disopyramide ) Class 1C antiarrhythmic ( e.g. , flecainide , propafenone ) , Class III antiarrhythmic ( e.g. , amiodarone , sotalol , ibutilide ) , antipsychotic ( e.g. , thioridazine , chlorpromazine , pimozide , haloperidol , droperidol ) , tri/tetracyclic antidepressant ( e.g. , amitriptyline , imipramine , maprotiline ) , ketoconazole , antiepileptic macrolide antibiotic . Patients stop ingestion grapefruit/juice .</criteria>
