	<brief_summary>Vaccination HIV infected individual sub-unit influenza vaccine safe ; however induce moderate immune response likewise modest protection compare HIV uninfected individual . Based upon available data , South African Thoracic Society provisionally recommend use influenza vaccine HIV infect individual CD4+ count &gt; 200/ml viral load &lt; 100 000 copies/ml . ( Green R et al . In press , SAMJ ) . This proposal however base upon recommendation make elsewhere minimal level evidence regard benefit , evidence country high prevalence HIV . Very HIV infect adult , however , actually receive influenza vaccine South Africa , partly absence compel data regard burden disease Africa well lack vaccine effectiveness issue relate physician awareness access influenza vaccine public immunization program . The conflict evidence , developed country Africa , regard effectiveness PPV highlight drawback extrapolate vaccine effectiveness data develop country develop country . Differences epidemiology HIV develop country prevalence HIV low high-burden sub-Saharan African country include : - difference mode transmission HIV demographic infected population . - difference standard care , include access prophylaxis opportunistic infection use highly active anti-retroviral therapy ( HAART ) - difference risk disease opportunistic pathogen , e.g . Mycobacterium tuberculosis , etc . These difference may contribute difference risk severity influenza illness among HIV infect adult community well possibly responsiveness effectiveness vaccination . The investigator conduct double-blinded , placebo control randomized trial HIV treatment clinic Helen Joseph Hospital determine effectiveness influenza vaccination HIV infect adult South Africa . The significance finding study help quantify burden influenza illness African HIV infect adult , well assist make informed recommendation use influenza vaccine HIV infect adult guide national policy prepare future influenza virus-pandemic .</brief_summary>
