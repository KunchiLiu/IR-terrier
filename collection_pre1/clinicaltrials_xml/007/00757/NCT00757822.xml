	<brief_title>Prevention Postoperative Nausea Vomiting ( PONV ) Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anesthesia become remarkably safe past two decade , yet postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) continue vex problem unacceptably high incidence . Multiple factor include age , gender , type surgery anesthetic agent , perioperative opioid use duration anesthesia implicate cause PONV . Several new drug introduce last two decade minimize PONV ; however incidence still remain significantly high , range 30 % first 24 postoperatively 35 % post discharge . Unrelenting PONV result delay discharge particularly significant outpatient surgery . The propose study examine anti-emetic property orally administer dronabinol give immediately prior surgery standard care intravenous ondansetron give end surgical procedure effort ass need cost effective prophylaxis PONV . The chemoreceptor trigger zone ( CTZ ) function emetic chemoreceptor vomit center . Many antiemetic drug act level CTZ responsible vomit patient receive chemotherapy postoperative patient . Our regimen oral dronabinol proven reduce incidence PONV patient receive chemotherapy . We intend prove regimen utilized patient receive chemotherapeutic drug work patient high risk develop PONV follow surgery . We hypothesize regimen preoperative low dose dronabinol superior efficacy standard antiemetic preventing incidence PONV , thus improve patient satisfaction also reduce length stay patient undergoing outpatient surgery . Specific Objectives 1 . Reduction postoperative postdischarge nausea vomit ambulatory surgery patient . 2 . Reduce rate hospital admission length inpatient stay outpatient surgery . 3 . Improve patient satisfaction outpatient surgery . Procedure After informed consent , surgical patient schedule outpatient abdominal surgery Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System ( CAVHS ) high risk develop PONV follow procedure randomize receive either study drug ( preoperative oral dronabinol-5 mg ) standard therapy ( 4 mg ondansetron intravenously end surgery ) . The outcome measure presence absence PONV , severity number episode , event count rescue antiemetic use patient satisfaction . All data record personnel blind drug regimen . Relevance : At CAVHS , 2/3 patient schedule outpatient surgical procedure everyday . Our regimen minimize postoperative postdischarge nausea vomiting , improve post-operative care unit ( PACU ) length stay , minimize unnecessary hospital admission , provide patient satisfaction cost containment . The potential application inexpensive intervention surgery enormous . Reducing incidence PONV could significant impact patient satisfaction . The intervention low-risk , efficacious , could substantially impact experience outcome Veteran undergoing surgery .</detailed_description>
