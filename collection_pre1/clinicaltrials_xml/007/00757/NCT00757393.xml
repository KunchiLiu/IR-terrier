	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis skeletal disorder characterize parallel loss bone mineral matrix result enhance bone fragility increase risk fracture . The associated fracture , morbidity mortality ensue , make osteoporosis public health problem enormous proportion . Clinical research observation strongly suggest adult osteoporosis root childhood identify genetic environmental factor central pathogenesis disorder . Osteoporosis major public health problem adult population increasingly diagnose childhood . Most case secondary chronic illness ( secondary osteoporosis ) . In chronically ill child several factor , addition underlie chronic illness , may predispose either reduce bone mass impairment bone quality . Osteoporosis otherwise healthy child ( primary osteoporosis ) generally classify either osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) juvenile idiopathic osteoporosis ( JIO ) . Optimizing Vitamin D calcium intake well weight bearing exercise program central approach prevention treatment osteoporosis . Despite increased awareness disorder pediatric population active implementation principle , ever increase number child osteoporosis present symptomatic disease ; progress stage frequent peripheral fracture , vertebral compression fracture and/or deliberate pain . Bisphosphonates often add therapeutic regiment . However , widely acknowledge little currently know key factor might predict safe effective use agent population . Children whose bone biopsy result indicate adynamic form osteoporosis low bone turnover marker make significant number child symptomatic osteoporosis . Many patient addition growth failure ( due prolong glucocorticoid usage chronic illness ) may low growth hormone secretion . In circumstance , agent choice would anabolic agent know increase osteoblast activity , normalize histomorphometric parameter improve bone quality . Unfortunately , one promising agent , recombinant PTH ( Teripeptide ) preclude use pediatric patient concern regard induction osteosarcoma . It unclear extent antiresorptive therapy might achieve goal , although become therapy choice default . The Growth hormone ( GH ) /IGFI- axis play central role longitudinal bone growth well acquisition maintenance bone mass child . Studies , growth hormone excess deficiency , suggest growth hormone may useful anabolic agent child osteoporosis . In acromegaly , bone turnover marker indicate activation osteoblast osteoclast . Both marker correlate circulate GH IGF-1 level . IGF-1 level increase cortical bone suggest anabolic action GH mediate local production . The impact bone density unclear , study show difference healthy control . However , study indicate increase cortical bone mass trabecular mass appear unchanged somewhat reduced . Furthermore rate appear increase . The Growth hormone ( GH ) /IGFI-axis plays central role longitudinal bone growth well acquisition maintenance bone mass child . Studies , growth hormone excess deficiency , suggest growth hormone may useful anabolic agent child osteoporosis . Growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) recognize result reduce bone mass , decrease bone turnover marker , secondary osteoporosis increase fracture rate . Epidemiological study suggest GHD alone may explain increased fracture rate see patient . Treatment GHD patient GH result increase turnover marker . While short-term study show little improvement bone mass , long term study treatment period 2 year show significant increase bone mass .</detailed_description>
