	<brief_summary>This chart review study neonate admit Primary Children 's Medical Center University Utah NICU develop diagnosis bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) treat condition inhale nitric oxide ( iNO ) begin 4th week life . For study BPD define need supplemental oxygen day 28 life . The data collection medical record gather demographic admission ( birth weight , gestational age , etc ) ; past medical history transferring hospital ; admission diagnose ; hospital respiratory care treatment course laboratory/xray finding ; nutrition growth ; discharge diagnose include major neonatal morbidity absence severity intraventricular hemorrhage , retinopathy prematurity , hear deficit . The data compile compare data previously publish similar infant BPD treat iNO .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neonatal Intensive Care ( NICU ) Course Hospital Outcome Infants With BPD Treated Using Inhaled Nitric Oxide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study ( e.g . Schreiber 2003 ) 1 prompt several large current clinical trial use inhaled nitric oxide ( iNO ) prevention bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) preterm infant . Results study yet publish forthcoming Spring 2006 . However , evidence suggest patient BPD , treatment iNO may improve oxygenation2 improve pulmonary blood flow relax pulmonary vascular tone . 3 Also , recent primate study suggest face exist BPD , treatment iNO may decrease oxygen ventilation requirement mechanism help preserve surfactant protein.4 Taken together , preliminary work suggest may clinical benefit treat establish BPD iNO . However , data exist clinical course BPD patient treat iNO , description necessary evaluate iNO potential treatment modality BPD . Since iNO use adjunctive therapy neonate PCMC serious respiratory disease , useful information relationship BPD iNO treatment may exist within patient population</detailed_description>
