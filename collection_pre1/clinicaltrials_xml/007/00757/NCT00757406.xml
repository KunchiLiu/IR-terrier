	<brief_title>Assessment Unilateral Lymphoedema Leg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When Lymphoedema present , lymph fluid build interstitial space tissue . This result overall increase total amount extracellular fluid ( ECF ) limb , cause swell . This document measure impedance ( opposition ) low frequency current pass limb . Low frequency current travel predominantly ECF , Lymphoedema manifest . As fluid build limb , impedance current decrease way low frequency bioimpedance able ass Lymphoedema . Multi-frequency bio-impedance analysis otherwise know Bioimpedance Spectroscopy ( BIS ) report effective measurement ECF sub clinical change ECF predict onset Lymphoedema arm study conduct Cornish et al . It report Warren et al BIS use reliable accurate tool document presence lymphoedema patient wither upper- lower-extremity swelling . The L-Dex U400 device use `` impedance ratio '' methodology assess unilateral Lymphoedema arm . By method unaffected arm act internal subject specific control . The strategy study show L-Dex U400 use methodology assess unilateral leg Lymphoedema .</detailed_description>
