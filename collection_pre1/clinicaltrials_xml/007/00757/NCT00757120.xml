	<detailed_description>COPD disease lung damage breathing passage become partly obstruct , make difficult breathe . Millions people United States COPD , fourth lead cause death country . Symptoms include cough , excess mucus production , shortness breath wheezing . Emphysema chronic bronchitis illness associate COPD . Emphysema usually result many year cigarette smoking , remain unknown exactly cigarette smoke cause emphysema . The purpose study examine current former smoker emphysema emphysema determine certain biomarkers genetic factor associate increase risk develop disease . Specifically , study researcher examine various gene two protein , membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase ( MT1-MMP ) extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer ( EMMPRIN ) , determine role play development emphysema . Participants attend one study visit , include medical history review , blood collection , lung function test , 6-minute walk test , chest compute tomography ( CT ) scan . A portion blood store current future genetic research . Participants also complete questionnaire collect information activity , health , quality life . Some participant invite return bronchoscopy , procedure allow doctor sample inside lung . Study researcher contact participant end study collect follow-up medical information .</detailed_description>
