	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample exhale breath patient ovarian epithelial cancer , polycystic ovarian syndrome , endometriosis healthy participant laboratory may help doctor identify learn biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor find diagnose ovarian epithelial cancer sooner , may easier treat . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study exhale breath biomarkers see well find ovarian epithelial cancer patient newly diagnose ovarian epithelial cancer , polycystic ovarian syndrome , endometriosis healthy participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Identify pattern exhale compound breath sample patient newly diagnose ovarian epithelial cancer significantly reproducibility different healthy volunteer use gas chromatography Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ( GC/FT-ICR MS ) . - Train five canine discriminate exhale breath sample patient newly diagnose ovarian epithelial cancer healthy volunteer . - Use canine olfaction GC/FT-ICR MS distinguish exhale breath sample patient newly diagnose ovarian epithelial cancer patient polycystic ovarian syndrome endometriosis . - Repeat breath sample patient newly diagnose ovarian epithelial cancer throughout course diagnosis therapy . OUTLINE : Exhaled breath sample collect patient healthy volunteer . The sample analyze gas chromatography Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ( GC/FT-ICR MS ) determine chemical composition , identity , predictive pattern biomarkers exhale breath condensate . GC/FT-ICR MS train canine olfaction use distinguish exhale breath sample patient ovarian epithelial cancer , patient polycystic ovarian syndrome endometriosis , healthy volunteer . Patients healthy volunteer complete questionnaire BRCA 1 BRCA 2 status ( know ) , alcohol use , smoking ( include duration type cigarette ) , physical activity ( duration type ) , socioeconomic status , education , county residence , age menopause ( applicable ) , age menarche , presence first- second-degree family history breast cancer ovarian epithelial cancer , body mass index ( height weight ) , co-morbidities .</detailed_description>
