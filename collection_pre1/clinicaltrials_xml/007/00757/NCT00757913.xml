	<brief_summary>Background : Delirium long-term cognitive dysfunction ( CD ) important complication major surgery intensive care treatment . Delirium associate increased mortality CD important impact mortality , independency , social interaction , quality life . Delirium important risk factor development long-term CD . Particularly , patient age 65 old undergoing cardiac surgery high risk develop problem . There data suggest inflammation play key role development delirium possibly CD . It show n-3 fatty acid modulate immune response patient beneficial effect abdominal surgery . Working hypothesis : 1 . Administration n-3 enriched nutrition therapy include modulate inflammatory response improve cognitive function cardiac surgery . Specific Aims : This project test impact perioperative enteral n-3 fatty acid ProSure , Abbott Nutrition ) elderly patient undergo elective cardiac surgery . Primary endpoint CD one week postoperatively . Methods : The investigator investigate 400 patient age 65 old undergo elective cardiac surgery . Half patient receive supplementary n-3 fatty acid modulate inflammatory response ; half receive isocaloric nutritional supplement without n-3 fatty acid ( Ensure Plus , Abbott Nutrition ) . Otherwise treatment patient influence study . Cognitive function assess preoperatively , 7 day three month postoperatively . C-reactive protein , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , S-100B , neuron specific enolase monitor marker systemic inflammation delirium .</brief_summary>
