	<brief_summary>The aim investigation determine whether synthetic hydroxyapatite effective enamel matrix protein periodontal regeneration patient intra-bony periodontal defect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Regenerative Treatment Intra-bony Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regeneration periodontal tissue diminish periodontal disease main goal periodontal therapy . While conventional surgical therapy offer limit potential towards recover tooth-supporting tissue , recently develop technique lead great predictable regeneration periodontal structure . Among technique , application enamel matrix proteins bone graft promote periodontal regeneration . The study prospective , control , mono-center , randomize , clinical trial , open operator , blind examiner . It conduct parallel group design . Participants least 1 intra-bony periodontal defect receive regenerative surgery baseline randomly select device . A newly develop synthetically manufacture bone graft material make hydroxyapatite ( Ostim ) product investigation . An enamel matrix protein derivative ( Emdogain ) act control device . Both material apply intra-bony defect periodontal flap surgery . Follow-ups take place 7 14 day post surgery , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month . The primary aim compare effectiveness test product control treatment 1- 2-wall intrabony periodontal defect amount bone fill 12 month surgery . Secondary parameter clinical attachment level gain reduction probe pocket depth 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
