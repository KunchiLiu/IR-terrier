	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Ramelteon Doxepin Subjects With Chronic Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 60 70 million adult United States alone affect insomnia . Daytime symptoms insomnia include tiredness , lack energy , difficulty concentrating , irritability . Recent epidemiologic research focus quality life identify significant insomnia-related morbidity relate work productivity , health care utilization , risk depression . Insomnia also associate diminished work output , absenteeism , great rate accident . Gamma-aminobutyric acid major inhibitory transmitter central nervous system currently prescribe sleep agent benzodiazepine receptor agonist , induce sleep binding benzodiazepine receptor site gamma-aminobutyric acid -A receptor complex . In addition sleep , benzodiazepine receptor agonist cause wide range ancillary effect directly relate sleep , include sedative , anxiolytic , muscle-relaxant , amnesic effect , risk tolerance , dependence , abuse potential . Doxepin one class psychotherapeutic agent know dibenzoxepin tricyclic compound . Doxepin indicate treatment depression , anxiety , psychotic depressive disorder . The common adverse event associate use doxepin drowsiness . A limited number control study perform examine effect low doxepin insomnia . TAK-375 ( Ramelteon ) melatonin receptor agonist affinity human melatonin receptor subtype 1 ( MT1 ) , melatonin receptor subtype 2 ( MT2 ) selectivity melatonin receptor subtype 3 ( MT3 ) receptor . This trial determine co-administration ramelteon doxepin decrease latency persistent sleep wake time sleep onset . Study participation anticipate 2 month .</detailed_description>
