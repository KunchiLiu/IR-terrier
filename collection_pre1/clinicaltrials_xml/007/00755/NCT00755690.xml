	<brief_summary>This study design describe physiological response increase decreased dietary phosphate intake various parameter mineral metabolism blood urine individual Chronic Kidney Disease stage 3 4 normal serum phosphate level . This detailed study give u far great understanding role diet abnormal mineral homeostasis early progression chronic disease . The finding study help physician dietitian better determine optimal time introduce dietary therapy CKD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Dietary Phosphate Mineral Homeostasis Early Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The potential benefit implementation phosphate management earlier CKD ( Stages 3/4 ) threefold : 1 ) prevention vascular damage early progression CKD thus reduce risk cardiovascular death 2 ) Improved management renal bone disease resultant co-morbidities 3 ) slow progression renal failure lengthen time require till dialysis require . Although dietary counsel currently normal part CKD care , utility effectiveness lower phosphate previously quantify . In part due difficulty measurement serum phosphate tightly control GFR fall 30mls/min . No study investigate whether possible modulate circulate FGF-23 phosphate excretion early stage renal failure use diet individual normal serum phosphate level . Study Objectives ; 1 . To measure FGF-23 level high phosphate diet , low phosphate diet low phosphate diet phosphate binder . 2 . To measure level calcium , phosphate , PTH , 25 1,25 vitamin D fractional phosphate excretion high phosphate diet , low phosphate diet low phosphate diet phosphate binder .</detailed_description>
