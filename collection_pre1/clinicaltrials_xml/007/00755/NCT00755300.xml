	<brief_summary>In patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty , thromboembolism common occurrence , especially follow tourniquet deflation . The result cardiopulmonary embolus potentially lead hypoxemia , hypotension , hemodynamic collapse post operative cognitive dysfunction due embolus . The standard surgical technique involve place intramedullary rod femur determine angle degree resection end femur . A new surgical technique utilizes computer navigation system perform desire cut appropriate position . The investigator hypothesize avoidance intramedullary instrumentation computer assist total knee replacement result few thromboembolic event compare standard technique use manual instrumentation femur . The present study test hypothesis quantify extent thromboembolism surgical technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Knee Arthroplasty And Thromboembolism : A Comparison Between Two Surgical Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , Transesophageal Echocardiography ( TEE ) routinely use intraoperatively monitor patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty thromboembolic event . Video recording ( without patient identifier ) TEE loop tourniquet release , offline analysis quantify extent thromboembolism two surgical technique compare . Patients assign particular technique accord non-rigid criterion . This study impact selection one group . Participation study influence choice/selection . We simply record analyze echo loop twenty patient already assigned surgical technique .</detailed_description>
