	<brief_title>The Effect Preoperative Oral Carbohydrate Attenuating Immediate Postoperative Insulin Resistance PI3K Dependent Signaling Pathway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative insulin resistance ( PIR ) central feature postoperative metabolism response surgical injury , result decrease insulin-stimulated glucose uptake skeletal muscle adipose tissue , increase glucose release hyperglycaemia . The PIR pronounce day surgery last 3 week uncomplicated elective open abdominal operation , consider factor clinical importance postoperative patient . Recent evidence elucidate toxicity hyperglycemia suggest causal relation PIR complication postoperative state degree PIR consider independent factor determine length postoperative hospital stay . The degree PIR proportional degree surgical trauma . Although overcome PIR insulin infusion one way combat hyperglycemia , prevention development also achieve preoperative oral carbohydrate instead overnight fast proven different kind surgery , total hip replacement surgery , colorectal surgery elderly patient undergo coronary artery bypass graft . As single intervention patient give 2-3 hour anaesthesia , efficacy preoperative oral carbohydrate show equally good intravenous infusion glucose regard PIR , attenuate development PIR 50 % measure first postoperative day major abdominal surgery . In placebo-controlled randomized control trial 65 patient undergoing major abdominal surgery , patient receive preoperative oral carbohydrate lose 0.5 cm mid-arm circumference discharge , placebo group twice reduction ( 1.1 cm ) . Furthermore , patient receive oral carbohydrate-rich beverage colorectal surgery small reduction quadriceps muscle strength operation 1 month without carbohydrate-rich beverage . These study suggest whole-body protein balance , muscle function well suppressive effect insulin endogenous glucose release well maintain enhanced patient receive carbohydrate-rich beverage surgery . Moreover , patient undergo surgery moderate severe degree PIR , PIR overcome sufficient amount insulin infuse maintain euglycemia , glucose uptake whole body substrate utilization could normalize presence elevate insulin concentration . The intensive insulin treatment maintain normoglycaemia post-surgical patient intensive care unit substantially reduce morbidity mortality . These finding show excessive insulin compensate defect insulin action well , suggest PIR might due block intracellular mechanism lead decrease glucose uptake . The human insulin receptor transmembrane glycoprotein , whose cytoplasmic domain contain insulin-activated protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) . Insulin signal initiated binding insulin extracellular α-subunit insulin receptor , result stimulation β-subunit , contain intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase activity , autophosphorylation receptor multiple tyrosine residue . Autophosphorylation receptor enhances intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity evoke series phosphorylation event . These include tyrosyl phosphorylation intracellular substrate name insulin receptor substrate ( IRS 1 4 ) , phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) , protein kinase B ( PKB ) . The phosphorylated protein mediate cellular action insulin . On hand , glucose uptake stimulate insulin muscle adipocytes translocation glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) intracellular pool plasma membrane . The translocation GLUT4 plasma membrane establish mediate PI3K , base use pharmacological inhibitor expression dominant negative mutant constitutively active form PI3K . As molecular switch regulate activity serine/threonine-specifc kinase , PTK PI3K signal pathway act cascade important mediate insulin 's effect endpoint response . Defects receptor kinase activity signal transduction skeletal muscle show previously major contributor pathogenesis insulin-resistant state , obesity type II diabetes . Despite finding , mechanism preoperative oral carbohydrate beverage consumption exerts effect attenuate immediate PIR patient still unknown . Defects insulin signal transduction via PI3K-dependent pathway may possible involved development PIR , highly speculate main molecular signal mechanism .</detailed_description>
