	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Alogliptin Glycemic Control Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Of approximately 19 million people United States diagnose diabetes mellitus , 90 % 95 % type 2 diabetes mellitus . The prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus varies among racial ethnic population show increase age , obesity , family history , history gestational diabetes , physical inactivity . Over next decade , disproportionate increase elderly population result mark increase diabetic patient , place ever-increasing burden family health care system . In response problem , Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center , Inc. develop SYR-322 ( alogliptin ) , selective , orally available inhibitor enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV . Dipeptidyl peptidase IV think primarily responsible vivo degradation 2 peptide hormone release response nutrient ingestion , namely glucagon-like peptide-1 glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide . Individuals want participate study require provide write informed consent . Study participation anticipate 14 Weeks . Multiple procedures occur visit may include blood collection , urine collection , vital sign include sit stand blood pressure pulse , body height weight , physical examination electrocardiograms .</detailed_description>
