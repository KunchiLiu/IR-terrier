	<brief_summary>Background : The investigator know exercise help child develop strong bone muscle generally stay healthy . What unclear however , much exercise child need low risk develop type 2 diabetes . Objective : The investigator try find whether high-intensity exercise short-period time well moderately intense exercise improve diabetes risk profile teen risk type 2 diabetes . The working hypothesis exercise-mediated improvement insulin sensitivity ( risk factor diabetes ) great follow vigorous intermittent physical activity follow low intensity physical activity overweight adolescent 13-18 yr risk T2DM . Brief Description Research Project : Teenagers age 13 18 yr , risk type 2 diabetes ( either family history abnormal response sugar ) randomly assign one two activity group control group . The activity group supervise exercise session 3 5 day per week 6 month . One group high-intensity exercise , lower-intensity exercise . We measure sensitive body insulin amount fat muscle liver tissue begin end exercise intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Effects Exercise Intensity Insulin Sensitivity Overweight Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Physical activity OverWEight youth Risk type 2 diabetes ( POWER ) Trial randomize controlled clinical trial design study effect aerobic exercise training regimens differ intensity ( relative peak fitness ) insulin sensitivity overweight youth . Additionally , trial explore biologic mechanism chronic physical activity alters lipid metabolism result improvement insulin sensitivity . We recruit 90 eligible adolescent randomly assign one two six-month intervention arm differ intensity elicit similar amount energy expenditure : ( 1 ) low intensity continuous activity arm ( 40-55 % peak oxygen uptake 60 min ) ; ( 2 ) vigorous intensity intermittent activity arm ( 70-85 % peak oxygen uptake 30 min ) sedentary control group . The primary outcome measure trial insulin sensitivity , measure directly Bergman 's frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Ethnic minority consider risk T2DM In utero exposure hyperglycemia ( i.e . mother gestational frank diabetes pregnancy ) and/or evidence hepatic steatosis ( serum ALT &gt; 60U/L , ultrasound MRIbased evidence steatosis ) . Exclusion criterion : The investigator exclude patient may alter insulin sensitivity tissue lipid content would confound ( mask ) effect intervention . These include overweight adolescent : diagnose impaired glucose tolerance type 2 diabetes currently treat corticosteroid atypical antipsychotic , agent significantly influence carbohydrate metabolism undergo puberty ( Tanner Stage 24 ) time investigation , associate transient change insulin sensitivity orthopaedic injury would prevent perform intervention experience weight loss enrol weight loss program six month prior study history alcoholism drug abuse .</criteria>
