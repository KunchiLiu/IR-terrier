	<brief_title>Metronomic Docetaxel Bevacizumab Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 80 % patient localized SCLC patient extensive SCLC relapse 1st line chemotherapy . For chemo-resistant patient ( eg relapse less 3 month 1st line chemotherapy sole agent approve 2nd line chemotherapy topotecan . Docetaxel show activity 1st line treatment ( ORR 17 % ) . The low dose metronomic chemotherapy administer short interval show vitro vivo antiangiogenic effect . Bevacizumab well know anti-angiogenic agent . Recently , phase III study 1st line treatment patient advance metastatic NSCLC show addition bevacizumab platinum-based regimen provide survival benefit . A number phase II study currently evaluate addition bevacizumab 1st line chemotherapy SCLC patient promise result safety efficacy . Given poor result 2nd line chemotherapy SCLC feel evaluation combination metronomic docetaxel bevacizumab ( 2 anti-angiogenic agent ) patient justified . This study evaluate combination metronomic docetaxel bevacizumab 2nd line treatment SCLC .</detailed_description>
