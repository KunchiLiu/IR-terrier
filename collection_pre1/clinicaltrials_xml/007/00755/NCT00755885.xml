	<brief_title>Abiraterone Acetate Treating Postmenopausal Women With Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety tolerability abiraterone acetate postmenopausal woman estrogen receptor- androgen receptor-positive advanced metastatic breast cancer . ( Phase I ) - To determine recommended phase II dose drug patient . ( Phase I ) - To evaluate clinical benefit rate drug 24 week patient . ( Phase II ) Secondary - To study pharmacokinetics drug patient . ( Phase I ) - To determine endocrine impact drug pituitary-adrenal-gonad endocrine axis . ( Phase I ) - To estimate duration objective tumor response patient . ( Phase II ) - To correlate response rate duration response endocrine profile patient . ( Phase II ) - To determine overall survival patient . ( Phase II ) Tertiary - To enumerate molecularly characterize circulate tumor cell . - To identify normal genetic variation predict resistance drug use pharmacogenomic analysis . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I study follow phase II study . Patients enrol phase II portion study stratify accord hormone receptor status ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] -positive androgen receptor [ AR ] status vs AR-positive ER-negative ) . Patients receive oral abiraterone acetate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically analyze pharmacokinetic assay ( phase I ) , pharmacodynamic assay , circulate tumor cell , pharmacogenomic analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK .</detailed_description>
