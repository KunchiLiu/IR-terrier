	<brief_summary>Mortality associate pelvic fracture result blunt trauma range 6 18 % . In case hemodynamic instability also present , mortality rate significantly great , report high 60 % . There general consensus among traumatologists initial management complicate subgroup patient . It largely debate whether emergent orthopedic fixation angiographic embolization first line treatment pelvic hemorrhage</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Angioembolization Management Pelvic Fracture-Related Hemodynamic Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic fracture usually isolated injury common severely injured patient concomitant abdominal thoracic trauma complicate management . In situation multiple source hemodynamic instability exist , need control hemorrhage quickly become imperative . In patient emergent laparotomy thoracotomy indicate , time pelvic bleeding source address prolong . Some would argue best initial management pelvic fracture surgical stabilization , others would support immediate angioembolization actively bleed pelvic vessel . The main drawback angiographic embolization occur separate Angio Suite facility , concern time lose patient transport environment less capable manage extremely unstable patient . At Hershey Medical Center , ten patient suffer pelvic fracture associate hemodynamic instability 2003 2007 manage intraoperative angioembolization ( Operating Room oppose Angio Suite ) . Extensive review publish orthopaedic , trauma surgery , radiology journal yield literature regard intraoperative angioembolization management approach patient . Whether approach carry medical institution , undoubtedly rare result yet report widely available literature . This novel approach potential stop pelvic bleed sooner control environment , surgical stabilization also accomplish simultaneously . Statistical analysis review patient do , may possibly show improvement survival , short length hospital stay , less time embolization , decrease need supportive measure blood platelet transfusion .</detailed_description>
