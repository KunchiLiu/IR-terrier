	<brief_title>Exploring Health Benefits Associated With Daily Pulse Consumption Individuals With Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : - Correlate serum adiponectin level daily intake pulse individual peripheral arterial disease - Monitor change arterial stiffness endothelial dysfunction individual early stage cardiovascular disease - Determine tolerability daily consumption pulse target population - Identify change expression profile white blood cell . Study Duration : 12 month Study Design : - This single site , open registration , dietary proof concept , food substance study design explore health benefit associate daily pulse consumption individual arterial disease - Each subject undergo 7-day adaptation period consist consumption ¼ cup pulse per serve daily , follow minimum ½ cup pulse per serve daily - Total duration subject participation 8 week ; - Subjects ask attend 3 in-person clinic visit duration participation study screening , registration/baseline end study assessment - Telephone follow-up subject occur week 1,2,4 , 6 - Both clinical assessment subject-based data collect various point study schedule - Subjects ask complete food frequency questionnaire outset , maintain 3-day food record two separate occasion , undergo brief semi-structured interview telephone follow-up assessment study Assessments : 1 . Screening Visit : Informed consent ; inclusion/exclusion criterion assessment ; medical history ; physical exam ; food frequency questionnaire ; 3-day food record 2 . Registration/Baseline : Registration ; ass change medical history ( include medication profile ) physical condition ; urine sample ; fast blood sample ; assessment arterial stiffness ankle-brachial index ; begin adaptation period ( 7 day ) food item contain ¼ c pulse per serve 3 . Visits 1,2,4 &amp; 6 : Telephone follow-up assess adverse event tolerability semi-structured subject interview ; distribution ( weekly ) food item contain minimum ½ cup pulse per serve ; 3-day food record repeat week 6 4 . Visit 8 ( final ) : Assess adverse event change medical history physical exam ; urine sample ; fast blood sample collection ; assessment arterial stiffness ankle-brachial index Outcomes : - Descriptive analysis clinical data : Demographics , medical history , physical finding , concomitant medication adverse event - Identification change endothelial function ( determine measure pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , ankle-brachial index , soluble adhesion molecule level coagulation status ) response dietary modification - Correlation serum adiponectin level , include adiponectin multimers truncate form ( globular adiponectin ) endothelial function - Correlation change endothelial cell function serum isoflavone level - Qualitative analysis data collect semi-structured subject interview ass parameter associate tolerability diet identify favour recipe - Profile cohort use 55,000 gene microarray identify potential biomarkers change gene expression ( phenotype mapping ) induce diet - Use microarrays examine gene methylation single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) DNA sample determine change expression profile due epigenetic modification ( global ) allelic ( individual ) variation study cohort response pulse-enriched diet - Serum urinary eicosanoids analyze multi-step procedure utilize liquid chromatography , derivitization step , thin-layer chromatography gas chromatography-mass spectrometry - Serum also analyze fatty acid composition use thin-layer chromatography gas chromatography</detailed_description>
