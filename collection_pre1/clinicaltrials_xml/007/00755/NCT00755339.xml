	<brief_summary>This study investigate sensation many people Tourette syndrome ( TS ) experience motor tic . It also test whether block sensation cause tic stop . People 18 65 year age TS least tic involve arm may eligible 3-part study . Those enrolled may participate part part 1 part 2 . Those choose participate part 3 must first complete part 2 . All must stop take medication TS medication may affect brain least 1 week study . Part 1 After numb skin muscle arm leg pre-tic sensation experience , response nerve test ask subject rate strength sensation pinprick stimulate nerve small electrical shock . Then , course approximately one hour , subject report pre-tic sensation motor tic count . The onset tic identify EMG , test use electrode skin indicate activity muscle . Part 2 Subjects brain wave record use magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) experience tic andpre-tic sensory experience . MEG test record magnetic field change produce brain activity . Subjects sit chair dome contain magnetic field detector . They watch clock report time sensory experience start . Tics record EMG . Later , standard MRI brain ( scan use magnetic field radio wave ) do see part brain produce activity record MEG . Part 3 Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) use try stop pre-tic sensation . For TMS , subject sits chair . A wire coil hold subject scalp , brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate region brain . The goal stimulation reduce sensory experience precedes tic one region body . During stimulation , subject hears click may feel pull sensation skin coil . There may twitch muscle face , arm leg . This study use pattern repeat pulse deliver short burst . Following train pulse , effect stimulation sensation test ask subject rate strength pinprick vibration . In addition , nerve stimulate small shock evaluate effect TMS nerve activity . To determine effect TMS pre-tic sensation , subject ask watch clock report sensory experience . The effect motor tic evaluate use EMG indicate tic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : We investigate whether sensory experience precedes motor tic Tourette syndrome generate peripheral nervous system whether may result altered sensory gating , whether necessary generate motor tic . Study Population : We study 100 subject . Thirty-five individual diagnosis Tourette syndrome describe sensory experience precede tic , 10 deny sensory prodrome total 45 subject . We also study 55 Healthy volunteer age 18-65.. Design : A Two-Part Study Part I : MEG record We determine extent CNS response tactile auditory stimuli habituate . Subjects present train stimuli , repeat 80 time . At end block , questionnaire ascertain subject perception stimulus . CNS responses stimulus record use MEG analyze first localization , amplitude frequency characteristic . Healthy volunteer include control group . Part II : rTMS inhibition We test whether sensory experience necessary generate motor tic . We inhibit sensory experience use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) cortical region identify prior ongoing image study group . Low intensity rTMS apply control . Sensory experience motor tic record rTMS.. Staged Study : This stag , exploratory study . In phase 1 , study 20 adult subject part II . Data analysis phase determine whether procedure well-tolerated safe enough allow inclusion adolescent child , age 14 older . Phase 2 involve completion part , 20 subject . Outcome Measures : &lt; TAB &gt; For part II , outcome measure 1 ) inhibition sensory experience , 2 ) relationship inhibition sensory motor phenomenon . For part I , outcome measure degree habituation TS subject compare healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
