	<detailed_description>When patient present physician symptom cancer later stage development , survival tends poorer . Earlier diagnosis cancer expect provide improve survival patient due earlier treatment intervention . However , implementation screen process impair access cost . A simple inexpensive test would serve screen tool could safely repeat regular interval identify person expensive less accessible diagnostic investigation might become appropriately directed . The specificity enzyme increase markedly cancer tissue , ease administration already license pharmaceutical prescription product , amantadine hydrochloride , would appear provide promise desirable screen test .</detailed_description>
