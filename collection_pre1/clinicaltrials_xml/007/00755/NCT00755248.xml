	<brief_title>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting : Factors Related Late Events Saphenous Graft Patency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass graft represent one frequent surgical procedure perform United States Europe . The clinical benefit myocardial revascularization relate freedom adverse cardiovascular event graft patency , great saphenous vein , nowadays main autologous vessel use graft coronary different anterior interventricular artery . Unfortunately , phenomenon lead early , , late complication graft occlusion fully clarify possible explain interindividual temporary variability progressive stenosis rate basis classical atherosclerosis risk factor . The aim study prospectively study role conventional risk factor ( preoperative risk factor clinical feature ) unconventional risk factor ( genetic polymorphism , inflammation coagulation marker ) saphenous late patency postoperative patient outcome , particular regard adverse clinical event ( myocardial infarction , successive stenting procedure , arrhythmias etc . ) bypass patency . Plasma venous sample collect day surgery , discharge hospital , follow-up patient undergo on-pump off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting store -80Â°C ; Patients followed-up periodically visit telephone interview , also invite undergo multislice ( 64 row ) CT scan order ass graft patency 12 24 month surgery . Finally relation conventional unconventional risk factor adverse event follow-up assess multivariable statistical model .</detailed_description>
