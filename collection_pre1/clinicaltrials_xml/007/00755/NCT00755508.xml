	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Ramelteon Combined With Gabapentin Treating Patients With Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 60 70 million adult United States alone affect insomnia . Daytime symptoms insomnia include tiredness , lack energy , difficulty concentrating , irritability . Recent epidemiologic research focus quality life identify significant insomnia-related morbidity relate work productivity , health care utilization , risk depression . Insomnia also associate diminished work output , absenteeism , great rate accident . gamma-aminobutyric acid major inhibitory transmitter central nervous system currently prescribe sleep agent benzodiazepine receptor agonist , induce sleep binding benzodiazepine receptor site gamma-aminobutyric acid -A receptor complex . In addition sleep , benzodiazepine receptor agonist cause wide range ancillary effect directly relate sleep , include sedative , anxiolytic , muscle-relaxant , amnesic effect , risk tolerance , dependence , abuse potential . Gabapentin novel anti-epileptic drug , currently use subject partial seizure . Some study show gabapentin also effect sleep architecture . In several study , include healthy subject , epileptic subject , subject restless leg syndrome , use gabapentin show prolong slow-wave sleep , increase total sleep time sleep efficiency , decrease number awakening . Ramelteon melatonin receptor agonist affinity human melatonin receptor subtype 1 , melatonin receptor subtype 2 selectivity melatonin receptor subtype 3 receptor . It also demonstrate agonist activity vitro relative melatonin cell express human melatonin receptor subtype 1 melatonin receptor subtype 2 receptor . The bind melatonin receptor think contribute maintenance circadian rhythm underlie normal sleep-wake cycle . The purpose trial determine co-administration Ramelteon gabapentin may produce increased sleep efficiency reduction wake time persistent sleep onset , addition reduction sleep latency increase sleep duration . Study participation anticipate one month .</detailed_description>
