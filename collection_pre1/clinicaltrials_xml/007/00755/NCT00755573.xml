	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate effect pregabalin pain result chronic pancreatitis . The effect investigate mean questionnaire concern daily experience pain general quality life . Furthermore patient invited participate experimental test multimodal pain model . The experimental test include stimulation skin , muscle visceral tissue . The result experimental part study may help u understand mechanisms action pregabalin patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Rationale The aetiology pain chronic pancreatitis remain elucidate . Therefore common guideline management pain exist topic great discussion . The area complicate fact clinical trial carry ( Wilder-Smith et al . 1999 ) . The best attempt establish clear guideline treatment chronic pancreatitis `` American Gastroenterological Association Medical Position Statement : Treatment Pain Chronic Pancreatitis '' ( Warshaw et al . 1998 ) . Initial treatment consist low fat diet non-narcotic analgesic , supplement oral pancreatic enzyme proton pump inhibitor . If acceptable level pain relief obtain drug , opioids remain management pain . Opioids number well-known adverse effect include elevation smooth muscle tone ( affect gastrointestinal motility ) , toxicity central nervous system especially induction addiction . Many patient suffer chronic pancreatitis history alcoholic abuse making opioids , associate abuse potential , less suitable patient . Alternatives medical treatment exist form nerve blockade , lithotripsy surgical treatment . However , result study non-medical treatment modality equivocal medical analgesic therapy must still consider first choice management painful chronic pancreatitis . Thus importance identify potential new treatment regime treatment pain chronic pancreatitis clear . In patient chronic pancreatitis pancreatic nerve find great diameter area innervate single nerve small ( Bockman et al . 1988 ) . A neural genesis pain therefore seem likely . The basis neurogenic generation pain may due altered expression neuropeptides like SP CGRP . The concentration nerve growth factor ( NGF ) receptor TrkA increase inflammatory area may lead enhanced transcription SP CGRP , transmitter pain system ( Di Sebatiano et al . 2003 ) . Interestingly , release SP know reduce agent pregabalin . Support neuropathic component pain chronic pancreatitis also find clinical observation , pain typically describe largely constant background pain shooting , burn lancinating episode may mimic see peripheral neuropathy . Finally , evidence central neuroplastic finding strong descend inhibition , may reflect pain mechanism neuropathic pain find recent study ( Dimcevski et al . 2006 2007 ) . Thus inflammatory `` true '' visceral pain component appear play role pancreatic pain . Hence potential extrapolate clinical trial demonstrate activity pregabalin treatment neuropathic pain treatment possible neuropathic component chronic pancreatitis great interest . Central sensitization essential factor development neuropathic pain ( Baron 2001 , Johnson et al . 2001 ) animal experiment NMDA receptor show involved process . Calcium play central role , increase influx calcium neuron observe NMDA receptor activate . The enhanced concentration intracellular calcium function second messenger number neurotransmitter calcium thus contributes maintenance central sensitization ( Nicholson 2000 ) . Pregabalin exert range effect pain transmission although precise mechanism action completely understood , likely involve bind drug calcium channel central nervous system ( Ben-Menachem 2004 ) . In animal experiment show pregabalin primarily exert effect dorsal horn , reduce pain signal see . Pregabalin ligand α2-δ subunit voltage-gated calcium channel bind pregabalin site result reduce calcium influx nerve terminal therefore reduce release several excitatory neurotransmitter , include glutamate , substance P ( SP ) , calcitonin-gene related peptide ( CGRP ) noradrenaline . This may result inhibition reduction sensitization mention . Moreover , may basis analgesic effect . It show , animal experiment , bind pregabalin calcium channel able counteract central sensitization dorsal horn . The evidence clinical effect pregabalin neuropathic pain substantial document number randomize clinical trial ( Dworkin et al . 2003 , Sabatowski et al . 2004 , Rosenstock et al . 2004 ) . The recommend dose treat neuropatic pain 150 mg 600 mg daily , similar dose chosen study . By opinion principal investigator clinically relevant medical interaction describe pregabalin administer chronic pancratitis patient . Pregabalin absorb small intestine saturable transporter ( Piyapolrungroj et al . 2001 ) . It well know pancreatitis patient suffer malabsorption fat therefore frequently suffer diarrhea . This could lead change mucosal surface small intestine , possibly change absorption pregabalin . Drug absorption never investigate patient suffer pancreatitis simple linear kinetics pregabalin make possible study drug absorption may vary patient . A poor absorption drug could partly explain pain pancreatitis difficult relieve .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female patient age 18 75 year diagnosis chronic pancreatitis diagnose use Mayo Clinic Diagnostic criterion criterion ( ( Layer P , Gastroenterology 1994 ; 107:14811487 ] ) . Both diabetic nondiabetic patient allow enter study . 2 . The patient must suffer chronic abdominal pain typical pancreatitis , meet criterion chronic pain ( pain ≥ 3 day per week least 3 month ) must consider pain severe enough medical treatment . 3 . Personally sign date informed consent document indicate patient inform pertinent aspect trial . 4 . Patients willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test trial procedure . 1 . Patients evidence history medical surgical disease importance study judge investigator 2 . Presence history major depression 3 . Patients previously diagnose moderate severe renal impairment . Patients creatinine value &gt; 2x ULN and/or significant change normal value exclude . 4 . Patients screen 12lead ECG demonstrate follow : heart rate &gt; 100 bpm , QRS duration &gt; 120 msec , QTc interval &gt; 450 msec , PR interval &gt; 210 msec , clinically significant rhythm abnormality , evidence myocardial ischemia injury . 5 . Patients clinically significant laboratory abnormality opinion investigator may increase risk associate trial participation may interfere interpretation trial result . 6 . Patients treat pregabalin ( Lyrica® ) previous 4 month . 7 . Treatment investigational drug within 4 month precede first dose study medication importance study judge investigator . 8 . Female patient pregnant lactating , intend become pregnant . Male patient intend father child course study . A pregnancy test conduct visit 1 3 ensure female patient pregnant study period . The investigator ensure fertile female patient use safe contraception method study least 35 hour termination study period . The following method consider safe contraception method : The pill IUD Gestagen Injection Subdermal Implantation ( Implanon ) Hormone vaginal ring Transdermal Plaster 9 . Patients unwilling unable comply lifestyle guideline . 10 . Patients must suffer generalized painful condition chronic pancreatitis ; however patient localize painful disorder allow enter study 11 . Clinical significant illness within two week participate study . 12 . Involved plan conduct study . 13 . Hypersensitivity pregabalin component .</criteria>
