	<brief_summary>Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption associate reduction cardiovascular event , red wine seem offer benefit type alcoholic beverage . However , relationship red wine consumption endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) remain unclear . The investigator examine whether intake red wine could enhance number functional capacity circulate EPCs upregulation nitric oxide ( NO ) bioavailability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Moderate ethanol intake type beverage show improve lipoprotein metabolism lower cardiovascular mortality risk , red wine , abundant antioxidant content , seem confer additional healthy benefit . Previous study indicate beneficial effect red wine derive increase endothelium-derived nitric oxide ( NO ) , imply enhance NO bioavailability may mediate cardiovascular protection provide red wine . Increasing evidence suggest injured endothelial monolayer regenerate partly circulate bone marrow derived-endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) , accelerate reendothelialization protect initiation progression atherosclerosis . Clinical study demonstrate number circulate EPCs predict occurrence cardiovascular event death cardiovascular cause may help identify patient increase cardiovascular risk . Although many epidemiologic study indicate light-to-moderate consumption red wine reduce incidence CAD , multifarious effect red wine circulate EPCs endothelial function remain determine . Therefore , design study test hypothesis intake red wine enhance number functional capacity EPCs increase NO bioavailability .</detailed_description>
