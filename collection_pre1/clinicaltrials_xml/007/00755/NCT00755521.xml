	<brief_title>Study Assessing Efficacy Etoricoxib Female Patients With Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) ill-defined clinical disorder characterize widespread pain diffuse tenderness assess specified anatomical location . The FMS 10 time common female , prevalence community increase two percent age 20 eight percent age 70 . Although American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) define classification criterion diagnosis FMS ' pathogenesis remain vague . Diffuse persistent musculoskeletal pain , consistent mention ACR criterion also report among patient ill define medical condition migraine , chronic fatigue pain , myofascial pain , irritable bowel syndrome presentation often overlap FMS . There mount data support overlap FMS psychiatric condition include depression , panic disorder anxiety . For example , lifetime history major depression report 50 % 70 % patient FMS current depression detect 18 % 36 % patient FMS . This association question raise possibility high prevalence reflect long term outcome cop chronic disable pain disability . Anti-depressants corner stone therapy FMS . Benzodiazepines recent experience melatonin implicate order alleviate sleep disturbance often encounter among patient disorder . Nevertheless , patient FMS often need therapeutical medication order ease acute exacerbation diffuse pain often provoke mental physical stressor . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , COX-2-selective agent acetaminophen often use large number FMS patient seek relief acute pain . However , numerous study fail confirm effectiveness analgesic FMS , although limited evidence patient may experience enhanced analgesia treat combination NSAIDs agent . We believe successful relief diffuse pain may sever bond tie pain increase anxiety characteristic patient . Furthermore , clinical path underline importance pain relief may ensure adherence compliance need element therapeutical multidimensional approach FMS may even improve psychiatric comorbidity stem chronic non relent pain . A major factor limit use NSAIDs concern development gastrointestinal complication bleed . COX-2 selective inhibitor develop decrease risk gastrointestinal tract injury avoid anti-platelet effect traditional NSAIDs . The recent MEDAL study confirm find randomize 30,000 patient either etoricoxib traditional NSAID diclofenate . Furthermore , MEDAL investigator demonstrate similar cardiovascular outcome measure patient group show use similar cardiovascular safety profile traditional used NSAIDS . Using safe analgesic low rate adverse event FMS patient , population enhance somatoform ideation , great importance may also insure adherence component therapy . Hypothesis - Adding etoricoxib , COX-2 selective inhibitor , therapeutic regimen patient FMS may ease degree pain ; improve measure quality life , disability , sleep , anxiety depression . Objectives - Organic , mental functional aspect FMS assess patient treat etoricoxib ( `` add '' ) compare placebo . The protocol-defined primary outcome measure pain severity measure self-reported BPI ( short form ) average pain severity score ( 15 ) . Secondary endpoint include tender point count , validate parameter measure quality life , quality sleep , disability , pain , depression anxiety fibromyalgia impact questionnaire ( measure physical function , pain assessment , fatigue distress ) . The study include eighty patient .</detailed_description>
