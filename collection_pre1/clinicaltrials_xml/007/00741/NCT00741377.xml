	<brief_summary>This study two portion , phase I portion phase II portion . The purpose phase I portion ass maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) characterize dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) escalate dos BHQ880 ( maximum dose 20 mg/kg ) combination standard chemotherapy zoledronic acid relapse refractory multiple myeloma patient . The phase II portion study also conduct relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patient . Patients treat various dos BHQ880 placebo combination standard chemotherapy . In phase II portion study zoledronic acid add first 28 day therapy BHQ880 placebo standard chemotherapy . This allow BHQ880-related change bone biomarkers detect zoledronic acid-free environment . The purpose phase II portion study , determine one dose BHQ880 development base dose-efficacy modeling . Efficacy define time first skeletal-related event change bone marker bone resorption formation relative placebo . A skeletal-related event define : - Pathologic fracture - Spinal cord compression - Requirement either radiation surgery bone due : - Pain - Prevention imminent fracture - Stabilization fracture Biomarker image endpoint assess phase study . The pharmacodynamic effect BHQ880 assess measure biochemical marker bone formation , resorption , metabolism serum urine . Charges serum DKK1 level characterize . The size number lytic bone lesion measure bone survey ( X-ray ) MRI assess . In addition , bone mineral density ( BMD ) measure DEXA scan select site QCT scan .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patient require treatment nonbortezomibcontaining regimen ( prior treatment bortezomib acceptable ) • The diagnosis symptomatic multiple myeloma ( International Myeloma Working Group ) 2 . Patients multiple myeloma measurable serum Mprotein measurable urine Mprotein must measurable increased concentration free light chain ( use FreeLite™ ) 3 . At least one prior SRE define one following : Pathologic fracture Spinal cord compression Requirement either radiation surgery bone due : Pain Prevention imminent fracture Stabilization fracture 4 . Current plan treatment zoledronic acid 5 . Ambulatory patient age 18 year old 6 . Adequate organ function 1 . Known concomitant disease ( ) know influence calcium metabolism include hyperparathyroidism , hyperthyroidism and/or Paget 's disease bone . 2 . Current active dental problem include Ongoing infection teeth jawbone ( maxilla mandibula ) Current expose bone mouth Dental fixture trauma Current previous osteonecrosis jaw Slow healing dental procedure Recent ( within 6 week ) plan dental jaw surgery study ( extraction , implant ) 3 . Patients allergic to/ intolerant bisphosphonate therapy 4 . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition ( e.g . uncontrolled diabetes , active uncontrolled infection , uncontrolled diarrhea ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol 5 . Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g . symptomatic congestive heart failure , uncontrolled arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply</criteria>
