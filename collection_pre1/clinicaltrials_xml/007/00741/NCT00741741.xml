	<detailed_description>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) -infected patient routinely treat combination 3 4 drug ( highly active antiretroviral therapy [ HAART ] ) , include nucleoside/nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs/NtRTIs ) , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) , protease inhibitor ( PIs ) , reduce risk viral resistance development . TMC278 new potent selective NNRTI development . It may able prevent replication virus consequence , prevent new HIV-1 infection . For novel indication , sustain release parenteral ( IM = Intramuscular SC = Subcutaneous ) formulation , name TMC278LA , allow sporadic dosing development . As second perspective , TMC278LA design cope , therapeutic treatment patient , pill burden obligation uninterrupted NNRTI treatment regular time interval , impose considerable compliance constraint HIV-infected patient . This formulation intend improve quality life patient drug compliance NNRTI treatment . This randomized , double-blind ( neither patient physician know name study drug ) , placebo-controlled clinical study evaluate safety , ( local ) tolerability plasma pharmacokinetics multiple dos novel formulation ( nanosuspension ) TMC278LA , contain 300 mg TMC278 per mL . A total 30 healthy volunteer select equally divided 3 panel . This study conduct male female volunteer . The clinical study may necessarily balance regard gender , intend aim 50 % gender . For safety reason , female must post-menopausal surgically sterile . The clinical study consist 3 panel : Panel 1 ( Multiple Dose 1 = MD1 ) , Panel 2 ( Multiple Dose 2 = MD2 ) Panel 3 ( Multiple Dose 3 = MD3 ) . MD1 , MD2 MD3 receive multiple dose regimen new formulation TMC278LA consist 4 successive IM dos ( 1-month interval ) Gluteus maximus ( MD1 MD2 ) 4 successive SC dos ( 1- month interval ) periumbilical region ( MD3 ) . The first dose ( load dose ) twice high follow 3 dos . Data collect first dose regimen serve substitute single dose . The dose regimen : MD1=600/300/300/300 mg ; MD2=1200/600/600/600 ( IM ) MD3=1200/600/600/600 mg ( SC ) . The study population include total 30 healthy adult volunteer . Ten volunteer enrol MD1 , MD2 MD3 ( 6 active , 2 vehicle , 2 saline ) . Each IM dose give one Injection Site ( IS ) ( Gluteus maximus muscle ) , except 1200 mg dose MD2 600 mg inject muscle ( left right Gluteus maximus muscle ) . Likewise , SC dose give one IS ( periumbilical region ) , except 1200 mg load dose 600 mg inject two ISs either site umbilicus . The new formulation concentration 300 mg/mL TMC278LA . Hence , maximum volume inject per injection site 2 mL . For multiple injection panel , rotation inject site recommend . The purpose dose sequence 3 MD panel provide load dose 300 mg ( MD1 ) 600 mg ( MD2 , 3 ) monthly regimen . In pharmacokinetics , load dose refers initial high dose drug may give begin course treatment drop low maintenance dose . A first safety review plan first 3 patient acute effect observe , follow 3 patient dose . A 2nd safety review plan acute effect observe , last 4 patient dose . Within Panel , second dose administer first dose consider safe well tolerate . The first dose MD2 start 1 month start MD1 , first IM dose MD1 evaluate Data Review Meeting ( DRM ) , approximately 3 week dosing , consider safe well tolerate . Similarly , MD3 start first dose MD2 consider safe well tolerate DRM . An extra DRM plan approximately 3 week 4th dose panel , order evaluate safety ( local ) tolerability 4 successive dos give 1-month interval . Dose Limiting Toxicities stop rule guide decision making DRMs . At DRMs , safety , local tolerability , systemic tolerability pharmacokinetic data collect till include 2 week dose evaluate . Based data collect load dose ( 1st dose ) , investigator sponsor decide whether safe proceed next dose give panel . The next dose adjust , require , base safety pharmacokinetic data available time , exceed 600 mg MD1 1200 mg MD2 MD3 . Such dose adjustment applicable patient particular panel . Upon unblinding Week 24 , patient placebo treatment allow leave study . In addition , patient receive active treatment TMC278 plasma concentration last sample take prior unblinding ( = WK20 ) 20 ng/mL allow leave study well , provide persistent AEs require follow-up . All patient active treatment TMC278 plasma concentration 20ng/mL last sample take prior unblinding , patient AEs require follow follow plasma exposure TMC278 20 ng/mL pending adverse event resolve stabilize , respectively . Based result TMC278-TiDP15-C146 clinical study , 90 % TMC278 expect wash within 20 week last dose . In case TMC278 exposure still 20 ng/mL WK 32 visit case persistent AE need follow , follow period extend TMC278 plasma exposure 20 ng/mL , AE resolve stabilize . The decision extent follow-up period communicate respective subject WK33 . These patient ask visit site every 4 week case follow-up TMC278 plasma exposure . Frequency on-site follow-up safety determine investigator case case basis . In Phase-I study healthy volunteer treatment medical care plan end clinical study . There 3 panel , patient randomize treatment either TMC278LA ( n=6 ) , vehicle ( n=2 ) saline ( n=2 ) . The dosing regimens consist 4 successive dos 1-month interval . Dosing regimen MD1 = 600/300/300/300 mg ( IM ) , MD2 = 1200/600/600/600 mg ( IM ) MD3 = 1200/600/600/600 mg ( SC ) . Patients receive saline vehicle , TMC278 plasma exposures 20 ng/ml , leave study WK24 . Other patient continue till WK32 beyond .</detailed_description>
