	<brief_summary>Cholera important diarrhoeal disease important cause death , particularly epidemic outbreak , Bangladesh many develop country . Used adjunct management dehydration , antimicrobial therapy use appropriate agent reduces diarrhoea duration stool volume severe cholera half . The usefulness antimicrobial , however , greatly erode increase prevalence resistant strain V. cholerae O1 . From October 2004 Matlab Hospital December 2004 Dhaka Hospital ICDDR , B , V. cholerae strain become increasingly resistant tetracycline erythromycin- two drug use treatment severe cholera adult child respectively . Because high prevalence resistance resort early 2005 use ciprofloxacin treatment multi drug resistant V. cholerae . Although isolates susceptible ciprofloxacin standard threshold disc-diffusion E-test use , majority strain demonstrate MIC value 0.250 µg/ml , hundred-folds great V. cholerae strain test early year , generally MIC &lt; 0.003 µg/ml . In randomized , double blind , control trial ass clinical bacteriological response 12 hourly oral dose ciprofloxacin 3 day first two dos 1 g later 4 dos 500 mg , compare single 1 g oral dose azithromycin . We use azithromycin comparator drug current circulating V. cholerae isolates susceptible ( MIC ≤ 0.125 µg/ml ) azithromycin , single-dose azithromycin evaluate earlier effective treatment cholera .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cholera cause infection human intestine Vibrio cholerae O1 V. cholerae O139 . It major health problem many develop country include Bangladesh.1 The importance cholera worldwide public health problem evident large number country affect cholera epidemics.2 Data Diarrhoeal Disease Surveillance system Dhaka Hospital demonstrate V. cholera O1 frequently isolate pathogen ( 617/2,068 i.e . 30 % ) patient attend hospital diarrhoeal illness 2006 . By extrapolate number patient enrol surveillance system estimate 30,000 total 106,531 patient attend hospital 2006 cholera- huge number patient indeed . Like diarrhoeal illness , prevention management dehydration use appropriate oral and/or intravenous fluid mainstay management cholera , irrespective severity . However , appropriate antimicrobial therapy useful adjunct therapy reduces duration diarrhoea , volume diarrhoeal stool ( thus amount oral intravenous fluid ) , also duration faecal excretion pathogen , V. cholerae O1 O139 50 % . 3-6 Based observation make numerous clinical trial , routine use appropriate antimicrobial therapy recommend management severe cholera , adults child . All three benefit , describe , important resources-constraint setting cholera endemic also epidemic outbreak . Nosocomial transmission cholera also increasingly recognize important problem,7 reduce duration excretion Vibrio cholerae stool associate appropriate antimicrobial therapy presumably decrease rate nosocomial infection . Lastly , shorten course illness , patient family ' quickly return normal life , lessen financial burden , particular relevance socio-economically disadvantaged population disproportionately share disease burden cholera . From time initial control trial antimicrobial therapy cholera , almost four decade ago,3 number antimicrobial agent evaluate useful treatment cholera . Tetracycline , chloramphenicol , doxycycline , furazolidone trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole find effective treatment cholera give multiple dos 3 days.8-14 Tetracycline 's long-acting congener doxycycline also effective administer single 1 2 g 200 300 mg oral dos respectively adults.13 , 14 Vomiting common problem association doxycycline therapy problem great doxycycline use 300 mg dose ( 39 % ) compare 200 mg dose use ( 30 % ) ; however , therapeutic efficacy well high dose ( mean duration diarrhoea 32h vs. 40h respectively.14 Antimicrobial resistance become important problem clinical management cholera . For example , 2006 virtually 683 clinical strain V. cholerae O1 isolate patient attend Dhaka Hospital multiply drug resistant 100 % resistance ampicillin , furazolidone co-trimoxazole , 83 % erythromycin 85 % tetracycline.15 All V. cholerae strain remain susceptible ciprofloxacin disc-diffusion testing , E-test MIC note increase 0.002 µg/ml 1993-2003 0.250-0.380 µg/ml 2006 Resistance V. cholerae commonly use drug tetracycline , doxycycline , furazolidone trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole also report Asia , Africa Latin America,17-20 In early 1990 's increase prevalence V. cholerae resistant antimicrobial commonly use treatment cholera ( tetracycline , ampicillin , co-trimoxazole ) prompt group others conduct series trial identify newer affective agent treatment cholera . We evaluate ciprofloxacin adult child infect V. cholerae O1 O139 , observe good rate clinical bacteriological response use multiple dos single dose administer once.11 , 21 , 22 Ciprofloxacin , member class drug call fluoroquinolones , act block action bacterial DNA gyrase.23 This enzyme , present human cell , responsible supercoiling bacterial DNA , essential element DNA functions.24 Without three-dimensional DNA structure cell unable replicate , thus bacterial growth rapidly halt . Ciprofloxacin active fluorinated 4-quinolones ( ciprofloxacin , norfloxacin , ofloxacin ) bacterial diarrhoea pathogens in-vitro assessed MIC . It relatively long serum half-life.25 Due multiple mechanism excretion toxic level quinolones usually accumulate body . Experience suggest resistance ciprofloxacin develop much slowly old quinolone agent nalidixic acid , rate spontaneous mutation much low multiple mutation require confer frank resistance.26 , 27 Increases MIC , however , occur single mutation , likely sequence occur among currently circulate V. cholerae isolate Bangladesh . Because resistance agent susceptibility isolate ciprofloxacin in-vitro , disc diffusion test , Dhaka Matlab Hospitals ICDDR , B change treatment policy ( early 2005 ) single-dose ciprofloxacin therapy treatment cholera irrespective patient ' age , except cholera pregnant woman . However , experience physician Dhaka Hospital quickly note sub-optimal clinical response ciprofloxacin therapy- high stool output long hospitalisation . A quick review clinical study recently publish New England Journal Medicine confirm findings.28 In study 26 ( 27 % ) 98 patient infected V. cholerae O1 experience optimal clinical response single-dose ciprofloxacin , 10 ( 10 % ) 98 patient bacteriologic cure , define protocol . Eventual determination MICs V. cholerae strain study reveal inferior clinical bacteriological response ciprofloxacin associate increase MIC values.29 Table 1 show increase ciprofloxacin MIC value observe 1993-1994 first conduct clinical trial ciprofloxacin subsequent year include 2005 ciprofloxacin first introduce routine use treatment cholera Dhaka Hospital . We see , median MICs increase approximately one hundred fold 1993 2006 .</detailed_description>
