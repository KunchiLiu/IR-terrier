	<brief_summary>Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) collective noun various chronic lung disease , include sarcoidosis idiopathic lung fibrosis ( IPF ) . Sarcoidosis multi-systemic disease include damage lung 90 % patient . Generally , disease describe systemic , granulomatous antigen-driven disorder . IPF disease lung , unknown cause induces strong inflammation reaction lead acute lung damage ultimately result formation scar tissue stiffness lung . Unfortunately , exact cause ILD still unknown . It suggest environmental work-related exposure various trigger exert effect course disease . Examples trigger include bacteria , organic agent pollen cotton dust inorganic agent like metal talc . Due unknown cause , difficult treat ILD . Consequently , current guideline medication anti-inflammatory agent severe case . Unfortunately , therapy completely effective . Triggers suggest cause ILD exert effect via various mechanism . On one hand , induce inflammatory reaction recently demonstrate various trigger include instillation material sicila . During inflammatory reaction , cytokine release induce oxidative stress , i.e . imbalance formation protection reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . On hand , ILD-inducing trigger may directly cause increased ROS production subsequently evoke inflammatory reaction . The objective current study investigate individual sensitivity development ILD exposure various trigger . Main focus difference formation protection ROS well occur inflammatory reaction exposure trigger . Furthermore , simple blood test develop study eventually even predict individual reaction subject various trigger . Finally , fully characterize development ILD exposure various trigger , exhale air patient study order identify specific marker oxidative stress damage .</brief_summary>
