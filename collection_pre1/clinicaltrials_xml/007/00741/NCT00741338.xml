	<criteria>Written inform consent require parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) prior protocolrelated procedure perform . ( A separate inform consent request parent ( ) genotyping , independent inclusion ) Participant 's parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) allow child 's participation willing able comply trial procedures The participant must include 5 year age time enrollment Clinical diagnosis severe ( Hurler ) phenotype MPS I Confirmed presence 2 nonsense mutation alfaLiduronidase ( IDUA ) gene ( , compound heterozygosity homozygosity ) . For purpose enrollment , genotyping may perform local laboratory . If genotyping perform local laboratory , sample collect analysis central laboratory enrollment Documented IDUA deficiency fibroblast , plasma , serum , leukocyte dry blood spot IDUA enzyme activity assay The participant clinically significant organ disease include : cardiovascular , hepatic , pulmonary , neurologic , renal disease , serious intercurrent illness extenuate circumstance , opinion investigator , preclude participation trial potentially decrease survival The participant previously receive treatment laronidase The participant know severe hypersensitivity excipients delivery solution laronidase investigational drug use study The participant undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) , regardless outcome , currently consideration transplant . If family later decide obtain HSCT , participant discontinue trial The participant receive investigational product within 30 day prior enrollment The participant prior treatment experimental protocol ( example , fibroblast injection ) might potentially induce antibody laronidase might affect interpretation participant 's antibody response laronidase The participant receive vaccination ( ) within 1 month prior enrollment , unwilling postpone vaccination Tolerance Induction Period trial The participant homozygous thiopurine methyltransferase ( TPMT ) deficiency , determine genotype ( presence 2 know null allele TPMT ) phenotype ( near complete absence TPMT enzyme activity ) The participant prior history tuberculosis positive test latent tuberculosis infection</criteria>
