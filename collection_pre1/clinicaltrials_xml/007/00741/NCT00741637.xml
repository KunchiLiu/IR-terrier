	<detailed_description>Cholera re-emerged 2006 global threat 79 % increase 2006 compare previous year . The re-emergence cholera increase increase number displace population live unsanitary condition . About 99 % report case Africa death report also region . Case fatality rate increase worldwide 2.7 % however , certain area Africa report much 30 % case fatality [ WER 2007 ] . These figure believe underestimate many 120 000 death due cholera estimate occur year [ WER 2001 ] . Underreporting common due inconsistency definition cholera limitation surveillance , however country report due fear international sanction . In 2007 , International Health Regulation come effect wherein trade economic sanction longer imposed country report cholera rather encourage open reporting contain prevent spread cholera epidemic [ WER 2007 ] . Provision safe water food , establishment adequate sanitation , implementation personal community hygiene constitute main public health intervention cholera . These measure fully implement near future cholera-endemic area . A safe , effective , affordable vaccine would useful tool cholera prevention control . Considerable progress make last decade development new generation oral vaccine cholera . These already licensed country consider wider public health application . The World Health Organization recently recommend new generation cholera vaccine consider certain endemic epidemic situation , indicate demonstration project need provide information cost , feasibility , impact use vaccine [ WHO Meeting 2002 ] . A killed oral cholera vaccine ( Dukoral™ ) long available internationally , however 2-dose schedule , use buffer cost vaccine long impeded use public health setting . A live oral vaccine ( Orochol™ ) , although internationally license currently available market . This vaccine available use child older 6 year old adult . Despite immunogenicity efficacy challenge study North American volunteer [ Tacket CO 1999 ] , field trial vaccine endemic area Indonesia , protective efficacy detect period observation [ Richie EE 1994 ] . A need exist improved cholera vaccine thermostable may use endemic country young age group . This new generation live oral cholera vaccine must administer single-dose regimen , thermostable , confer high grade long-term protection may give child 2 year age mass immunization campaign EPI . In Diseases Most Impoverished Programme ( DOMI ) IVI , Peru-15 ( CholeraGarde® ) identify promising vaccine candidate . It live oral attenuate cholera vaccine derive V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain first isolate Peru 1991 [ Taylor DN 1994 ] . This advantage biotype current pandemic strain . Peru-15 attenuate several genetic modification deletion . By deletion ctx A rtxA gene , render unable encode cholera toxin subunit A RTX toxin make non-toxigenic ; inactivation recA gene deletion attRS1 sequence , make unable integrate exogenous DNA make non-recombination absence potentially inflammatory flagellum render non-motile [ Taylor DN 1994 , Kenner 1995 ] . Phase I II study perform North American volunteer find safe immunogenic [ Kenner 1995 , Sack 1997 ] . Furthermore , vaccine strain isolated stool volunteer retain non-motile characteristic . In challenge study among North American volunteer , Peru-15 provide 100 % protection moderate severe diarrhoea , 93 % diarrhoea [ Cohen 2002 ] . This vaccine underwent phase I II study cholera-endemic area Matlab , Bangladesh three age group : adult age 18 - 45 year , child age 2 - 5 year infant age 9 - 23 month [ Qadri 2007 ] . In study , vaccine show safe elicit vibriocidal response among age group . Only 1 20 adult 8 140 child vaccine recipient excrete vaccine strain . Analysis strain isolate revealed strain remain unchanged phenotypic genotypic property passage stool . Although vaccine give single dose , appear immunogenic infant , vaccine require stringent cold storage condition -20ºC . Avant Immunotherapeutics Inc. , manufacturer Peru-15 , currently reformulate vaccine order make thermostable . In order ass whether vaccine safe immunogenic previous formulation , lyophilize formulation need undergo clinical test endemic community . The International Vaccine Institute ( IVI ) Cholera Vaccine Initiative ( CHOVI ) together Avant Immunotherapeutics Inc. , manufacturer Peru-15 vaccine , negotiate agreement allow clinical trial perform cholera-endemic country , include , India , Bangladesh , Thailand . This eventually enable licensure facilitate international use vaccine obtain WHO recommendation global use . This single dose vaccine may easily use endemic country deploy time outbreaks likely occur . Because cholera tend occur area seroprevalence HIV also high , safety immunogenicity vaccine cholera must establish among HIV infect individual . There limited data regard use oral cholera vaccine among HIV seropositive individual . A study Beira , Mozambique , area 20-30 % HIV seroprevalence reveal killed oral rBS-WC vaccine may effective cholera [ 12 ] . However , specific data HIV status safety vaccine determine study . The live attenuate CVD 103 HgR vaccine find equally safe among HIV seropositive HIV seronegative individual Mali . The vaccine however find result attenuate immune response among HIV seropositive individual [ Perry 1998 ] . In order Peru-15 cholera vaccine use extensively cholera outbreak cholera endemic setting HIV co-exists , safety immunogenicity must first establish among HIV-seropositive individual . To gain approval use develop world , single-dose CholeraGarde® confer high level protective efficacy three year give endemic population 9 month old . However , undertake phase III efficacy trial , series phase II clinical study need conduct order confirm safety immunogenicity vaccine . Since cholera HIV co-exist area world , safety immunogenicity Peru-15 vaccine must establish among HIV seropositive individual .</detailed_description>
