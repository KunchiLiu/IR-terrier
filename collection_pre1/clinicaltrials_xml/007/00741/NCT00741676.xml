	<brief_summary>Among surgical method gastric cancer , incision 15 ~20 cm length prepare open gastric cancer surgery 0.5 ~ 1.2 cm laparoscopy gastric cancer surgery . Complications pain , abdominal adhesion , problem associate delayed recovery common open surgery large incision ; however , complication less common laparoscopy surgery small size incision prepare . Range surgery curative dissection depend level progress cancer , i.e. , depend whether gastric wall invasion , lymph node metastasis , invasion adjacent organ present . Since recurrence lymph node operation common , important step gastric surgery dissect lymph node completely . According gastric cancer surgery manual publish Japan Gastric Cancer Association , D2 lymph node dissection essential improve survival rate advance gastric cancer . More D2 lymph node dissection relatively safely conduct open surgery , whereas controversial laparoscopy surgery hard maintain surgical field laparoscopic condition . Recently , widen rage lymph node dissection use laparoscopy possible laparoscopic surgical technique accumulate new surgical device introduce . According case report , D2 lymph node dissection laparoscopy surgery show similar result one open surgery aspect recurrence rate number dissect lymph node . Also , accord Hur el. , case upper gastric cancer , laparoscopy surgery useful dissect # 10 # 11 lymph node.In prospective case study , investigator would like compare effectiveness , complication , pattern recurrence , survival rate two surgical approach , laparoscopy distal gastrectomy open distal gastrectomy . The investigator randomly operate advance gastric cancer patient , need distal gastrectomy D2 lymph node dissection . Surgical method select randomly whether open surgery laparoscopy surgery . Finally , investigator wish case report contribute establishment safety effectiveness laparoscopy surgery conduct advanced gastric cancer . Consequently , case report contribute establish ideal surgical method advance gastric cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In arm , subtotal gastrectomy ( dissect 2/3 stomach total omentectomy ) D2 lymph node dissection ( around common hepatic artery , celiac artery , proximal part splenic artery ( 4d , 4sb ) , hepatoduodenal ligament , superior mesenteric vein ) wiil perform basically . As general rule , Billroth II method use gastric reconstruction cases.Billroth II gastrectomy link gastric pouch jejunum 10~15 cm distal ligament Treitz . An antecolic retrocolic gastrojejunostomy connects jejunum stomach one continuous segment . For anastomosis , absorbable suture use . Anastomotic diameter 5~6 cm length . Drainage tube insert right flank area additional drainage tube insert need .</detailed_description>
