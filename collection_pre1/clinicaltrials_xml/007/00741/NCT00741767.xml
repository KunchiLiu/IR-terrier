	<brief_title>The Impact Salmeterol-Fluticasone Sleep Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common clinically important disease characterize chronic , irreversible airflow obstruction . Poor sleep quality insomnia well described phenomenon patient COPD . Several study suggest sleep disturbance adversely affect quality life may worsen daytime pulmonary function COPD patient . Improving sleep quality patient COPD , therefore , may improve health quality , also attenuate decline daytime pulmonary function . Previous study investigate effect inhale bronchodilator sleep quality COPD show conflict result . These conflict data prompt u perform retrospective study patient COPD co-existing sleep apnea ( OSA ) investigate effect mechanical lung function impairment lung hyperinflation sleep . Our study find significant correlation increase lung hyperinflation reduce sleep efficiency ( measure sleep quality ) , relationship preserve multivariable regression model . We hypothesize Advair Diskus improve sleep quality reduce lung hyperinflation COPD . To test hypothesis , propose double-blinded , placebo control cross-over study Advair Diskus patient COPD lung hyperinflation . It mutually decide sponsor principal investigator terminate study early due study subject enrollment difficulty .</detailed_description>
