	<detailed_description>Ambulatory blood pressure ( BP ) measurement ( ABPM ) correlate closely target organ damage cardiovascular event clinical cuff measurement . ABPM reveal significant circadian variation BP , individual present morning increase , small post-prandial decline , extensive lower nocturnal rest . However , certain pathophysiological condition , nocturnal BP decline may reduce ( non-dipper pattern ) even reverse ( riser pattern ) . This clinically relevant since non-dipper riser circadian BP pattern constitute risk factor leave ventricular hypertrophy , albuminuria , cerebrovascular disease , congestive heart failure , vascular dementia , myocardial infarction . Hence , grow interest best tailor individualize treatment hypertension accord specific circadian BP pattern patient . The reduction normal 10-20 % sleep-time BP decline characteristic non-dipper riser pattern indeed associate elevate risk target organ damage , particularly heart ( leave ventricular hypertrophy , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction ) , brain ( stroke ) , kidney ( albuminuria progression end-stage renal failure ) . These result suggest cardiovascular risk could influence BP elevation alone , also magnitude circadian BP variability . However , potential dimension alter BP profile still debate , current discrepancy actual prevalence non-dipper BP profile among group interest , mainly elderly , patient diabetes patient resistant hypertension . Moreover , several independent prospective study suggest nighttime BP may better predictor cardiovascular risk daytime BP . Common previous trial prognostic significance ABPM rely single baseline profile participant , without account possible change BP pattern , mainly associate antihypertensive therapy age follow-up . Moreover , potential benefit , i.e. , reduction cardiovascular risk , associate normalization circadian BP variability ( e.g. , conversion non-dipper dipper pattern ) appropriately envision treatment strategy still matter debate . The HYGIA study design investigate , first , comparative prognostic value several BP parameter ( include , among many others , BP variability , diurnal/nocturnal ratio , diurnal nocturnal mean , hyperbaric index , slope morning rise , etc ) prediction vascular , metabolic , renal morbidity mortality ; second , whether potential change circadian BP pattern treatment hypertension medication may associate change risk cardiovascular event , stroke , diabetes , and/or chronic kidney disease ; third , keep second major objective , assess potential change efficacy , safety profile , and/or capability hypertension medication , use either alone combination , modulate circadian BP pattern reduce vascular , metabolic , renal risk function circadian time administration .</detailed_description>
