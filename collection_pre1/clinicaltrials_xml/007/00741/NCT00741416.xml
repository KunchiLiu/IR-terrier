	<brief_summary>Blood sample health information ( e.g. , age diagnosis , test result ) collect purpose genetic research . The blood sample assign number store repository safe keep need research project . Participants person healthy ( high blood pressure , diabetes , high cholesterol level ) person Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) live Indiana . Participants complete questionnaire time blood sample drawn contact year update health history . Researchers apply Fairbanks Institute use blood sample health information minus participant name contact information . Their research require related find gene substance make gene may involve Coronary Artery Disease purpose improve investigator understand illness potentially lead development new diagnostic tool identify illness , new treatment , preventative measure . This study repeat disorder like Diabetes Cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biorepository : Indiana Health Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Aim : The purpose study create extensively annotate bio-repository platform hypothesis-driven research lead advancement diagnosis , treatment prevention diseases common population Indiana . The first phase research platform create collect blood sample two group individual Central Indiana community , one document evidence coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , second group age , gender ethnicity match individual without clinical evidence CAD . Each individual 's blood sample link clinical , demographic epidemiological information , gather retrospectively prospectively . This repeated individual Cancer , Diabetes potentially illnesses . Recruitment : This initial study include 750 individual CAD ( CAD Group ) 750 individual age , gender , ethnicity match CAD Group , without presentation clinical evidence CAD ( Control Group ) . To reflect grow representation Hispanics Central Indiana , Hispanics overly recruit group study population accurately reflect general population Central Indiana . Follow-up : As prospective , longitudinal study , follow-up study subject intend continue indefinitely , unless , course , time , consent follow-up withdrawn subject . Follow-up include continue access subject 's medical record , well facilitate continue contact telephone , pursue data concern change subject 's health . Subjects may contact telephone , mail email every twelve month ask wish continue participation study . The collected dataset ( make collect blood sample link clinical epidemiological information collect retrospectively prospectively ) , use medical research find gene , gene product RNA proteins help understanding cause disease guide development new treatment .</detailed_description>
