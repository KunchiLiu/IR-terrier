	<brief_summary>This multicenter , non-randomized , Phase II study patient previously untreated NSCLC amenable radiotherapy surgical treatment . The planned enrollment trial 78 patient ( include 10 % rate inevaluable patient ) . There total 39 patient cohort ( Cohorts A B ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Carboplatin +/- Bevacizumab Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial include lead-in phase cohort ass safety . In Cohort A , 10 patient receive ixabepilone 30 mg/m2 carboplatin AUC = 6 intravenously ( IV ) Day 1 one 21-day treatment cycle . If unexpected toxicity occur , Cohort A open enrollment . Enrollment Cohort A do two stage ( lead-in portion complete ) . The first stage Cohort A enroll total 22 patient ( include 10 patient lead-in phase ) . If least 3 response stage 1 , enrollment stage 2 proceed . For stage 2 study , 17 additional patient enrol ( total 39 patient Cohort A ) . During stage 1 stage 2 , patient Cohort A receive treatment ixabepilone 30 mg/m2 carboplatin AUC = 6 intravenously ( IV ) Day 1 21-day treatment cycle . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity occurs . After lead-in phase Cohort A complete , similar lead-in portion , also consist 10 patient , do Cohort B . Patients Cohort B receive ixabepilone 30 mg/m2 , carboplatin AUC = 6 intravenously ( IV ) , bevacizumab 15 mg/kg Day 1 one 21-day treatment cycle . If unexpected toxicity occur group , Cohort B open enrollment . Enrollment Cohort B also do two stage ( lead-in portion complete ) . The first stage Cohort B enroll total 22 patient ( include 10 patient lead-in phase ) . If least 3 response stage 1 , enrollment stage 2 proceed . For stage 2 study , 17 additional patient enrol ( total 39 patient Cohort B ) . During stage 1 stage 2 , patient Cohort B receive treatment ixabepilone 30 mg/m2 , carboplatin AUC = 6 intravenously ( IV ) , bevacizumab 15 mg/kg Day 1 21-day treatment cycle . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur . Unexpected toxicity include grade 4 hematologic toxicity grade 3/4 non hematologic toxicity reverse within 7 day 2 patient . Eligible patient receive ixabepilone , carboplatin , bevacizumab ( bevacizumab administer patient Cohort B ) 21-day interval . Patients evaluate every 6 week use computerized tomography ( CT ) scan . Response therapy assign use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) ( Therasse et al . 2000 ) ( see Section 7 ) . Patients objective response stable disease continue treatment 6 cycle , time tumor progression intolerable treatment-related side effect . Patients Cohort B without progressive disease eligible receive bevacizumab monotherapy 6 additional cycle , undue toxicity tumor progression occur .</detailed_description>
