	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Followed Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) become feasible 1960s elucidation Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) complex . Since , therapy evolve effective treatment many hematologic disorder . Otherwise incurable malignancy frequently cure approach , likelihood cure range 10 % 85 % , depend disease disease status . The treatment strategy incorporate large dos chemotherapy often radiation eliminate cancer cell immunosuppress recipient allow engraftment donor cell . Donor cell give rise hematopoiesis within two three week , rescue patient effect high dose therapy . In ideal situation , immune recovery recipient-specific tolerance occur follow 6-18 month , patient cure underlying malignancy , immunosuppression , functionally intact donor-derived immune system . However , complication common include fatal organ damage effect high dose chemotherapy , infection , hemorrhage , , particular , graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) . A realistic estimate transplant-related mortality standard HLA-matched sibling set approximately 25 % . The risk treatment-related mortality limit success certainly preclude use old patient . Thus , new strategy transplantation need . With grow understand much curative potential allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplant ( SCT ) immune anti-tumor effect donor cell , know graft-versus-leukemia ( GvL ) graft-versus-tumor ( GvT ) , new strategy employ shifts emphasis high-dose chemo-radiotherapy donor-derived , immune-mediated anti-tumor therapy . In approach , patient receive preparative regimen , anti-tumor activity , mainly design immunosuppressive enough allow engraftment donor stem cell lymphocytes . Engrafted lymphocyte mediate GvL effect ; GvL effect initial transplant sufficient , additional lymphocyte may infuse ( achievement engraftment allow additional lymphocyte `` take '' recipient without require additional conditioning recipient ) . The low intensity preparative regimen lessen overall toxicity minimize dos chemo-radiotherapy . In addition , less intensive preparative regimen may associate less GvHD , much evidence suggest high-dose therapy contribute syndrome GvHD cause tissue damage , lead cytokine milieu enhance activation graft-versus-host ( GvH ) effector cell . Thus , approach may allow safe use allogeneic transplant standard population may allow extension allogeneic transplantation patient could receive standard ( myeloablative ) transplant age co-morbidities . This protocol investigate non-myeloablative transplant approach , use fludarabine cyclophosphamide , allow engraftment allogeneic cell , may mediate anti-tumor effect .</detailed_description>
