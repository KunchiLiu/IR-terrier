	<brief_summary>The aim report evaluate unstimulated whole saliva flow patient head neck cancer exclusive radiotherapy association lauryl-diethylene-glycol-ether sodium sulfate calcium hydroxide ( Hct20 ) . This study hold buccal cancer center UNESP involve thirty one patient ( n = 31 ) divide two group : Group 1 seventeen patient ( n = 17 ) submit fractioned radiation treatment head neck region total dose 7.000 cGy Hct20 treatment . Group 2 fourteen patient ( n = 14 ) start use Hct20 end radiotherapy . A weekly measure collection index total non stimulate saliva flow do patient group . The value obtain analyze statistically Bartlett test , Friedman test Wilcox test , seek evaluation effectiveness medication prevention intense drop salivary flow radiotherapy avoid xerostomia post-radiotherapeutic period . The patient group 1 end radiotherapy keep base index total non stimulate salivary flow , one group 2 use medication association radiotherapy great improvement total non stimulate salivary flow usage Hct20 well result index salivary flow radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Unstimulated Whole Saliva Flow During After Radiotherapy , With Use HcT20</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty one patient observe treated Oral Cancer Center - Brazil , March 1997 June 2006 , distribute two group follow way : Group I compose seventeen patient utilized Hct20 period radiotherapy Group II compose fourteen patient utilized drug association radiotherapeutic treatment . The average patient group I 58.8 Group II 64.7 year old . In distribution , sex , group I compose fourteen male three female group II 11 male four female.As color , group I present sixteen white patient one non-white group II present 12 white two non-white . From patient group I , eight refer elitism , six report social elitism three deny ; patient group II five refer elitism , two report social elitism seven deny . All patient , group , present lesion primary site mouth , oropharynx larynx diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma . The patient include research carrier oral oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma guide exclusive radiotherapeutic treatment.To accept study , establish requirement field irradiation include occasion major salivary gland , partially totally.Patients use medical drug wich could interfere salivary flow rate , teeth , mucositis alteration oral mucosa radiotherapy excluded.Group I compose seventeen patient ( n=17 ) perform eight saliva collection , one treatment ( c0 ) seven collection ( C1to C7 ) seven week radiotherapy utilize Hct20.Group II compose fourteen patient ( n=14 ) Who perform nine collection , one collection ( C7 ) end treatment without utilize Hct20 , six collection ( c8 C13 ) utilize Hct20 first two month radiotherapy two collection ( C14 C15 ) three four month radiotherapy suspend use Hct20.The total dose administer patient 7000 cGy , fraction dos 200 cGy daily , Five fraction weekly . The composition Hct20 800 ml distilled water , 200 ml lauryl-diethylene-glycol-ether sodium sulfate ( 0.125 g/ml ) 2 g calcium hydroxide.The patient receive vial contain Hct20 orient perform two oral rinse daily 10 ml.The collection unstimulated whole saliva weekly perform always day week , around time , breakfast , without oral hygienization , office illumination silence without presence company period patient office.The patient expel unstimulated salivary secretion test tube calibrate cubic millimeter funnel eight centimeter diameter adapt it.At end collection , wich last five minute , add three ml distil water sample , store temperature 6 degree Celsius 24 hour order decrease bubble foam sample . The three ml add end collection despise moment final reading.The value obtain analyze statistically Bartlett test , Friedman test Wilcox test , seek evaluation effectiveness medication prevention intense drop salivary flow radiotherapy avoid xerostomia post-radiotherapeutic period . The patient group 1 end radiotherapy keep base index total non stimulate salivary flow , one group 2 use medication association radiotherapy great improvement total non stimulate salivary flow usage Hct20 well result index salivary flow radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
