	<criteria>Patients must advance and/or metastatic , histologically cytologically document solid tumor lymphomas , available therapy show provide clinical benefit . Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) &gt; 70 % . Must ≥18 year age . Expected survival &gt; 3 month . Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , woman premenopausal surgically sterile ) must use accepted contraceptive method ( abstinence , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , oral contraceptive double barrier device ) , must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior treatment initiation . ( Note : Pregnant patient exclude effect CPI613 fetus unknown . ) Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive method study period , unless documentation infertility exist . Mentally competent , ability understand willingness sign inform consent form . No radiotherapy , treatment cytotoxic agent ( except CPI613 ) , treatment biologic agent within 3 week prior treatment CPI613 . At least 2 week must elapse prior surgery hormonal therapy . Patients must fully recover acute toxicity prior treatment cytotoxic drug , radiotherapy anticancer modality ( return baseline status note recent treatment ) . Patients persist , stable chronic toxicity prior treatment ≤Grade 1 eligible , must document . Laboratory value ≤2 week must : Adequate hematologic ( white blood cell [ WBC ] ≥3500 cells/mm^3 ≥3.5 bil/L ; platelet count ≥100,000 cells/mm^3 ≥100 bil/L ; absolute neutrophil count [ ANC ] ≥1500 cells/mm^3 ≥1.5 bil/L ; hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥9 g/dL ≥90 g/L ) . Adequate hepatic function ( aspartate aminotransferase [ AST/SGOT ] ≤3x upper normal limit [ UNL ] , alanine aminotransferase [ ALT/SGPT ] ≤3x UNL ( ≤5x UNL liver metastasis present ) , bilirubin ≤1.5x UNL ) . Adequate renal function ( serum creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL 177 µmol/L ) . Adequate coagulation ( International Normalized Ratio INR must ≤1.25 ) . Serious medical illness , significant cardiac disease ( symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , New York Heart Association Class III IV ) , severe debilitate pulmonary disease , would potentially increase patient ' risk toxicity . Patients active central nervous system ( CNS ) epidural tumor . Any active uncontrolled bleeding , patient bleed diathesis ( e.g. , active peptic ulcer disease ) . Pregnant woman , woman childbearing potential use reliable mean contraception ( teratogenic potential CPI613 unknown ) . Lactating female potential excretion CPI613 breast milk . ( Note : Lactating female exclude effect CPI613 nursing child unknown . ) Fertile men unwilling practice contraceptive method study period . Life expectancy le 3 month . Any condition abnormality may , opinion investigator , compromise safety patient . Unwilling unable follow protocol requirement . Dyspnea minimal moderate exertion . Patients large recurrent pleural , peritoneal effusion require frequent drainage ( e.g . weekly ) . Patients amount clinically significant pericardial effusion . Active heart disease include myocardial infarction within previous 6 month , symptomatic coronary artery disease , arrhythmias require medication , symptomatic congestive heart failure . Albumin &lt; 2.5 g/dL &lt; 25 g/L . Evidence active infection , serious infection within past month . Patients know HIV infection . Patients receive standard investigational treatment cancer , investigational agent indication within past 3 week prior initiation CPI613 treatment . Patients receive immunotherapy type within past 4 week prior initiation CPI613 treatment . Requirement immediate palliative treatment kind include surgery . Patients receive chemotherapy regimen stem cell support previous 6 month . A marked baseline prolongation QT/QTc interval ( e.g. , repeat exhibition QTc interval &gt; 470 ms. ) . A history additional risk factor torsade de pointes ( e.g. , clinically significant heart failure , hypokalemia , family history Long QT Syndrome ) . Troponin I institution limit normal Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) 35 % .</criteria>
