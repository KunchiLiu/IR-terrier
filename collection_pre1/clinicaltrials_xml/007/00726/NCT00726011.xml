	<brief_summary>Different pathophysiologic mechanism responsible development chronic pain disorder . Pain pathway trigger part ectopic discharge voltage-sensitive sodium channel , abundance peripheral central nervous system . Tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) selective blocker Na+ channel cause analgesia either decrease propagation action potential Na+ channel and/or block ectopic discharge associate chronic pain . TTX extract puffer fish ( fugu ) . Results animal pharmacology study reveal TTX potent analgesic standard analgesic agent aspirin , morphine meperidine . At present , management severe cancer pain generally include use opiate . This often result undesirable side effect , treatment type medication always effective . Because currently available pain-relieving therapy unsatisfactory many patient , need new therapeutic approach management moderate severe cancer pain . Recent study indicate intramuscular ( muscle ) subcutaneous ( skin ) injection tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) may reduce pain cancer patient respond standard therapy . The current propose study ( TEC-006OL ) design provide option patient participate TEC-006 study ( tetrodotoxin placebo-treated ) receive continue receive tetrodotoxin treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tetrodotoxin Open-label Efficacy Safety Continuation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : In cancer patient moderate severe pain participate TEC-006 study : Primary Objectives : - To assess long-term efficacy subcutaneous tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) treatment reduce pain outcome improving quality life ( physical emotional functioning ) . - To assess long-term safety tolerability subcutaneous tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) . Secondary Objective : • To assess duration analgesia follow repeated cycle tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) treatment . Overall Study Design : This multicentre , open-label , continuation trial efficacy safety tetrodotoxin patient inadequately control moderate severe pain associated cancer . All patient participate TEC-006 study ( tetrodotoxin placebo-treated ) , would like continue tetrodotoxin treatment meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , eligible receive First Treatment Cycle continuation study . The study conduct centre participate TEC-006 study . Patients may receive repeated cycle treatment tetrodotoxin . Each Treatment Cycle consist 4 day treatment 30 μg b.i.d . tetrodotoxin inject subcutaneously . Each Treatment Cycle last start treatment end analgesic response . All patient complete first Treatment Cycle protocol must meet criterion Responder ( First TEC-006OL Treatment Cycle ) definition order eligible second Treatment Cycle . Patient eligibility subsequent Treatment Cycles determine use eligibility criterion Repeated Treatment Cycle . Sample Size : Up 120 patient . Investigational Product : 30ug TTX ( Tetrodotoxin injectable ) inject subcutaneously twice daily 4 day . Efficacy Variables : Worst pain last 24 hour , average pain last 24 hour , and/or component-specific pain intensity last 24 hour , ATC breakthrough analgesic use , impact pain physical functioning ( general activity , walk ability , normal work ) , emotional functioning ( mood , relation people , enjoyment life ) . Safety Variables : Safety assessment include adverse event reporting , vitals sign , physical neurological examination , 12-lead electrocardiogram , clinical laboratory test . Data Analysis Method : An initial analysis result TEC-006OL study complete parallel TEC-006 study . Further periodic analysis complete every 6 month study close . All efficacy safety analysis perform subject dose least protocol TEC-006OL . All analysis perform descriptive . No statistic involve hypothesis test perform .</detailed_description>
