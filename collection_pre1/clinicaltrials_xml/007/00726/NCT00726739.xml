	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cell kill tumor cell . Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving aldesleukin together vaccine therapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether aldesleukin effective without vaccine therapy treat melanoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well aldesleukin work give without vaccine therapy treat patient stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aldesleukin With Without Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare progression-free survival patient stage IV melanoma treat aldesleukin v without allogeneic large multivalent immunogen melanoma vaccine LP2307 . Secondary - To compare clinical response patient treat regimen . - To compare 1- 2-year survival rate patient treat regimen . - To determine whether immune response generate vaccination patient . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive allogeneic large multivalent immunogen melanoma vaccine LP2307 intradermally day 1 aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) day 7 8 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( control ) : Patients receive aldesleukin SC day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression may cross receive treatment arm I . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically correlative laboratory study . Samples analyze immune response keyhole limpet hemocyanin tetanus toxoid ( control antigens ) ELISA assay ; IFN-γ production CD8 T cell response melanoma-derived peptide ELISpot assay ; delayed-type hypersensitivity response vaccination ; frequency peripheral blood lymphocyte , include T cell , B cell , NK cell , monocyte , flow cytometry . - Arm III Crossover : Patients progressive disease Arm II offer crossover Arm I provide continue meet study criterion . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 1 year , every 3 month disease progression , periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
