	<detailed_description>An innovative dietary approach obesity , base set-point theory body weight associative learning , develop Seth Roberts , professor psychology University California Berkeley . The set-point theory first propose G. Kennedy , hypothesize body fat , like body temperature , control set point thermostat-like system . Based theory subsequent work , Roberts hypothesize people strong condition response specific food item , raise weight set point , like thermostat , stimulate appetite store excess calorie fat . In environment attractive , easily accessible , inexpensive food , many people gain weight . Roberts also hypothesize consistency presentation , labeling , taste mass produce food item today elicit strong condition response past . Roberts 's approach focus dissociate flavor calorie consume small amount bland calorie-dense food extra-light olive oil sugar water meal . Roberts believe dissociation flavor calorie lower body weight 's set point , suppress appetite thereby induce weight loss without cause hunger . Decreased oral intake naturally follow decrease appetite , without hunger normally quickly appear people reduce caloric intake , people eat amount feel comfortable without conscious dietary restriction . Roberts outline approach book title `` The Shangri-La Diet '' really diet . Given originality approach , successful outcomes account book anecdote internet definitely warrant close look . Studying feasibility Shangri-La Diet particularly relevant patient take drug cause increase appetite weight gain side effect , increase hunger make usual calorie restriction approach even difficult normally . Low-income people diet high prepackaged standardize food , may one contribute factor high risk develop obesity . Specific Aims - To test acceptance , patient ' compliance rate , Shangri-La Diet - To ascertain whether controlled clinical trial Shangri-La Diet would feasible . - To see weight loss document anecdotally many people reproducible patient low-income area overweight take prescribed medication associate increase appetite weight gain . Methods 2 . Subjects receive light olive oil , capsule fish oil flaxseed oil , take daily home weight base dosing , base dos recommend Dr. Roberts ' work . Doses within recommended dietary range improve intermediate outcome coronary artery disease ( HDL , LDL , triglyceride ) range associate decreased risk cardiac cause mortality epidemiological study . They return weekly measurement weight , waist measurement , discussion problem oil , dose adjustment oil . 3 . Evaluation : At end 6 week intervention , subject complete questionnaire baseline , evaluation form intervention . Analysis : The primary end point acceptability dietary intervention measure final interview evaluation form—is something patient would willing long term ? Secondary outcome change participant ' weight , waist measurement , anxiety , depression score .</detailed_description>
