	<brief_summary>This clinical trial see treatment etanercept early skin graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) effectively treat prevent progression disease without use high dose steroid . GVHD common complication follow bone marrow transplant another donor . GVHD occur transplant , donor 's blood cell ( call lymphocyte ) recognize part body , skin , foreign . A certain chemical , call Tumor Necrosis Factor , TNF , also cause damage skin . The main effect skin red rash , skin GVHD mild , severe form skin blister . We study GVHD University Michigan past decade . We know high level TNF make GVHD bad . Our research show add anti-TNF drug ( call etanercept EnbrelÂ® ) standard GVHD treatment high dose steroid lead improvement GVHD twice many patient compare steroid alone use . It standard practice University Michigan many center treat GVHD steroid etanercept . The management early skin GVHD patient involve treatment steroid , give cream either mouth ( pill ) IV . Early skin GVHD also call grade I GVHD , mean skin rash cover less half body . Steroid treatment effective ; however , also cause many complication increase risk infection , weight gain , stomach ulcer , muscle weakness bone damage , among many others . We develop study test whether start treatment etanercept steroid cream alone treat GVHD without require use high dose steroid . The goal avoid complication come high dose oral IV steroid treatment . The high dose steroid treatment would begin GVHD get bad .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patient must undergo HCT ( donor cell source ) either myeloablative nonmyeloablative preparative regimen . 2 . Patient may age . 3 . Patient must biopsyproven Grade I acute GVHD ( Appendix A ) . Biopsy report back Pathology prior enrollment . Patients whose biopsy GVHD identifies pathology inconsistent GVHD remove study replace . However , GVHD clinical diagnosis , biopsy nondiagnostic show clear nonGVHD etiology cause remove patient study . 1 . Patients pregnant ( positive urine serum test ) nursing . 2 . Active infection unresponsive antibiotic ( &gt; 2 consecutive [ least 24 hour apart ] , positive blood culture initiation treatment ) . 3 . Allergic otherwise undesirable reaction etanercept . 4 . Use oral intravenous steroid previous time GVHD treatment . Prior use steroid therapy ( i.e . hydrocortisone ) premedication transfusion permissible . Prior use topical steroid allow . 5 . Use etanercept purpose . 6 . Noncompliance medication . 7 . Grade IIIV GVHD ( history time study entry ) .</criteria>
