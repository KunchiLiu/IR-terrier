	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate compare relative bioavailability Quinine Sulfate capsule follow single , oral dose healthy volunteer fast fed condition . Twenty-two healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , male female volunteer age 18 45 year age randomly assign crossover fashion receive two Quinine Sulfate dose regimen sequence 7 day washout period dose period . On morning Day 1 , subject receive either single oral dose Quinine Sulfate ( 2 x 324 mg capsule ) follow overnight fast least 10 hour , single oral dose Quinine Sulfate ( 2 x 324 mg capsule ) 30 minute standardize , high-fat breakfast . After 7 day washout period , morning Day 8 , subject receive alternate regimen . Blood sample draw participant dose 48 hour post-dose adequately define pharmacokinetics Quinine Sulfate . A goal study evaluate safety tolerability regimen healthy volunteer . Subjects monitor throughout confinement portion study adverse reaction study drug and/or procedure . Blood pressure heart rate measure prior dose 1 , 2 , 4 12 hour dose study exit . A 12 lead electrocardiogram ( EKG ) record study check-in 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 24 hour dose administration . All adverse event whether elicited query , spontaneously report , observe clinic staff evaluate Investigator report subject 's case report form .</detailed_description>
