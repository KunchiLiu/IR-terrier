	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine combination reduce fluence photodynamic therapy Ranibizumab : Similar efficacy Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) alone . The ability reduce number intravitreal injection Ranibizumab 13 month period The ability reduce number PDT treatment . The study also collect information safety combination therapy single therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Reduced Fluence PDT /Visudyne With Ranibizumab v Ranibizumab Monotherapy Exudative Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 13 month prospective , blind , randomize sham control parallel safety study . There 2 treatment arm . Arm 1 receive reduce fluence PDT baseline follow immediately intravitreal injection Lucentis . Subjects arm 1 receive 2 additional injection Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) next 2 month . Starting month 3 , receive combination reduce fluence PDT intravitreal Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) develop recurrence subretinal fluid , cystoid macular edema , increase pigment epithelial detachment ( PED ) , increase retinal thickness &gt; 100 micron compare best prior thickness measure OCT . Patients eligible repeat combination reduce fluence PDT + intravitreal Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) every 3 month thereafter . Group 1 patient eligible treatment combination reduce fluence PDT Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) point 3 month time point thereafter . After month 3 , patient eligible combined therapy ( &lt; 3 month since last combination therapy ) &gt; 2 line vision loss &gt; 100 micron increase retinal thickness OCT compare recent measure monthly visit , would eligible injection Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) monotherapy . Thereafter , subject combination therapy retreatment criterion meet &gt; 3 month since last PDT treatment . Study arm 2 receive 3 monthly intravitreal injection Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) . Following month 2 , eligible re-treatment Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) retreatment criterion meet ( criterion study arm 1 ) . At interval le 3 month previous sham PDT , receive sham PDT retreatment criterion meet .</detailed_description>
