	<brief_summary>This study aim ass possible alteration coagulation ( blood clot ) follow treatment sequential compression device ( SCD ) plus low-molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) oppose LMWH alone . The investigator examine coagulation early postoperative period patient undergo major abdominal surgery stay Intensive Care Unit . In addition common laboratory test , investigator examine coagulation use TEG® , device allow semi-quantitative examination phase coagulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) routinely use perioperative prophylaxis thromboembolic complication [ ( chiefly deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) ] . LMWHs prove safe equipotent superior compare unfractionated heparin . Sequential compressing device ( SCD ) relatively novel pneumatic stocking several air chamber . A computerized pump applies gradient pressure decrease foot cranially . Pressure also apply intermittently accord predetermine schedule . This device employ DVT prophylaxis patient anticoagulation therapy contraindicate , low risk DVT . They also employ complement anticoagulant therapy patient high risk DVT , undergo orthopedic surgery ( Fordyce , 1992 ; Handoll , 2002 ; Warwick , 2002 ; Pitto , 2004 ) . The mechanism action SCD seem primarily mechanical , displacement column blood venous system towards heart ; act surrogate muscular pump immobilize patient ( Killewich , 1995 ) . There also evidence SCD activity may influence coagulation/fibrinolysis system towards hypocoagulability ( Dai , 2000 ; Kohro , 2003 ) ; Kohro colleague also hypothesize shear force generate SCD may alter platelet adhesion direct effect platelets and/or increase release factor venous endothelium ( Kohro , 2005 ) . The investigator aim assess effect coagulation SCD apply patient high risk DVT addition standard LMWH therapy.The investigator choose study population SCD may useful reduce incidence DVT , patient undergo postoperative monitoring intensive care unit ( ICU ) major abdominal surgery cancer . In addition standard laboratory test , investigator use thrombelastography ( TEG® ) ass phase coagulation . A TEG parameter , maximum amplitude ( MA ) , link increase thrombotic complication postoperative population ( McCrath , 2005 ) .</detailed_description>
