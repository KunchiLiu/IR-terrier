	<brief_summary>The objective research program determine transfusion threshold require maximize functional recovery major orthopedic surgery ( total hip/knee replacement ) , often , elderly patient serious comorbidities . Hypothesis : hypothesize threshold hemoglobin concentration exist functional recovery become difficult , even vital prognosis patient impair .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anemia frequent surgical procedure . Postoperative anemia associate increase incidence transfusion , probably , increase incidence morbidity mortality . However , majority study evaluate consequence postoperative anemia retrospective , since anemic patient transfuse , unable distinguish effect anemia per se transfusion . In orthopedic surgery , two randomize control trial ( RCT ) attempt determine benefit transfusion patient population . The first evaluated benefit allogeneic transfusion patient undergo surgery fracture hip second evaluate autologous transfusion patient undergo total knee replacement . The small number patient include study allow definitive conclusion benefit ( lack thereof ) transfusion orthopedic surgery . Traditionally , transfusion trigger 100 g/L recommend postoperative period , especially old patient serious comorbidities . In Transfusion Requirements Critical Care trial , much low transfusion threshold ( 70 g/L ) adopt group patient transfusion restrict . This prospective randomize trial include 838 patient , , day , important field generate unexpected result . Serious morbidity ( cardiac respiratory particular ) mortality increase adoption low transfusion trigger number transfusion decrease significantly . On hand , common observe fatigue , decrease exercise capacity muscle strength , impaired performance activity daily life presence anemia , especially hemoglobin concentration decrease 90 - 100 g/L . In orthopedic surgery , decrease `` postoperative vigor '' prevent patient undertaking rehabilitation program require improve functional recovery hip fracture repair . The objective research program determine transfusion threshold require maximize functional recovery major orthopedic surgery ( total hip/knee replacement ) , often , elderly patient serious comorbidities .</detailed_description>
