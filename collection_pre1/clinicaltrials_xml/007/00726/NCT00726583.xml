	<detailed_description>PX-866 target inhibitor PI-3K . This study conduct determine maximally tolerate dose PX-866 give orally two different schedule : daily day 1-5 8-12 28 day cycle daily day 1-28 28 day cycle .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis advance solid tumor fail intolerant standard therapy , standard therapy exist . 18 year age old . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Predicted life expectancy least 12 week . Discontinued prior chemotherapy investigational agent least three week prior receive first dose study drug ( six week mitomycin C , nitrosureas , vaccine , antibody therapy ) recover toxic effect prior treatment ( recovered baseline ≤grade 1 per Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) ) . Discontinued radiation therapy least four week recover radiationrelated toxicity ( recovered baseline ≤CTCAE grade 1 ) prior receive first dose study drug . Palliative radiation 10 fraction less permit four week interval necessary ( also allow therapy ) . Adequate hematologic function define follow : WBC count &gt; 3,000 cells/μL ; platelet &gt; 100,000/μL ; hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL ( may transfuse level ) ; ANC &gt; 1500 cells/μL . Adequate hepatic function define follow : bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL ; aspartate aminotransaminase ( AST/SGOT ) &amp; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT/SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN &lt; 5 x ULN due metastatic disease . Adequate renal function define serum creatinine level &lt; 1.5 mg/dL . Any active infection study entry . Known diabetes fast blood glucose &gt; 160 mg/dL . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Any serious concomitant systemic disorder opinion investigator would place patient excessive unacceptable risk toxicity . Surgery within four week prior first dose Significant central nervous system ( CNS ) psychiatric disorder ( ) preclude ability patient provide inform consent . Known suspected brain metastasis receive adequate therapy patient require treatment steroids anticonvulsant . In case previously treat brain metastasis , minimum four week interval completion radiation therapy registration study radiologic evidence stable respond brain metastasis require . In set previous CNS metastasectomy , adequate ( minimum four week ) recovery surgery and/or radiation therapy document . Leptomeningeal brain metastasis exclude regardless whether metastasis treat . History seizure , nonhealing wound , arterial thrombosis . Unstable atrial ventricular arrhythmia require control medication ; cardiac ischemic event experience within precede six month ; prior history congestive heart failure require therapy . Breastfeeding pregnant ( confirm serum βHCG within 10 day prior start study treatment applicable ) . Total gastrectomy , partial bowel obstruction gastrointestinal condition may interfere absorption study medication . Any condition could jeopardize safety patient compliance protocol .</criteria>
