	<brief_title>A Dose Proportionality Study Quinine Sulfate Capsules Under Fasting Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate compare dose proportionality 324 mg Quinine Sulfate capsule follow single oral dose ( 1 x 324 mg capsule versus 2 x 324 mg capsule ) healthy adult volunteer administer fasting condition . Twenty-four healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , male female volunteer least 18 year age randomly assign crossover fashion receive two Quinine Sulfate dose regimen sequence 7 day washout period dose period . On morning Day 1 , overnight fast least 10 hour , subject receive either single oral dose treatment A , Quinine Sulfate 1 x 324 mg capsule , single oral dose treatment B , Quinine Sulfate 2 x 324 mg capsule . After 7 day washout period , morning Day 8 follow overnight fast least 10 hour , subject receive alternate regimen . Blood sample draw participant dose 24 hour post-dose confined basis time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics Quinine Sulfate . Blood sample continue non-confined basis 36 48 hour post-dose . A goal study evaluate safety tolerability regimen healthy volunteer . Subjects monitor throughout confinement portion study adverse reaction study drug and/or procedure . Blood pressure heart rate obtain prior dose schedule follow dose . All adverse event whether elicited query , spontaneously report , observe clinic staff evaluate investigator report subject 's case report form .</detailed_description>
