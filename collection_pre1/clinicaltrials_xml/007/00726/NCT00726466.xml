	<brief_summary>Efalizumab immunosuppressive recombinant humanize IgG1 monocolonal antibody ( 150 Kd ) bind human CD11a ( 1 ) use treatment plaque psoriasis . Efalizumab derive humanization murine efalizuman monoclonal antibody MHM24 , recognize human chimpanzee CD11a . Humanization MHM24 accomplish graft murine complementarity determine region ( hypervariable region ) consensus human IgG1/ heavy light chain sequence ( Werther et al 1996 ) . These consensus human immunoglobulin sequence successfully use humanization murine antibody , include target HER2 IgE . Efalizumab inhibit bind LFA-1 intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) thereby inhibit adhesion leukocyte cell type . Ranibizumab recombinant , humanize , Fab fragment mouse monoclonal antibody target VEGF . As VEGF bind cellular receptor , stimulate angiogenesis vascular leakage . Blockade VEGF ranibizumab lead reduced stimulation cell proliferation permeability result inhibition angiogenesis decrease leakage . Ranibizumab intravitreal administration neovascular AMD patient show effectively reduce vascular leakage growth CNV stabilize improve visual function . To improve visual acuity , combination therapy use efalizumab ranibizumab propose . Efalizumab could target adhesion factor precede angiogenesis improve outcome AMD patient combination anti-VEGF agent , Ranibizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Efalizumab Combined With Intravitreal Ranibizumab Treatment Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , study 0.5 mg intravitreal dose Ranibizumab combination 1 mg/kg/wk subcutaneous dose Efalizumab subject AMD . 10 subject 1 site enrol study . Subject accrual trial expect complete within 6 month . All subject evaluate monthly full ocular examination , visual acuity measurement ( ETDRS chart distance 4 meter ) , OCT , adverse event monitoring . Fluorescein Angiography ( FA ) fundus photo do BSL , Months 3 , 6 , 9 12 . Subjects receive efalizumab 1mg/kg weekly subcutaneous injection 24 week . Subcutaneous Efalizumab injection self administer initial teaching session office Day 0 . Subjects receive six initial dos 0.5 mg/eye intravitreous monthly injection ranibizumab ( Day 0 , Months 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 ) schedule follow-up visit monthly 12 month . Re-treatment first six injection as-needed basis , base predefined criterion . 3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN The rationale study follow : - Phase III study patient primary recurrent choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) secondary age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) treat repeated intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab show evidence bioactivity , safety , tolerability ( Rosenfeld 2006 ) ; - Phase III study patient chronic moderate severe plaque psoriasis treat weekly subcutaneous efalizumab injection 1mg/kg show evidence bioactivity , safety , tolerability ( Dubertret 2006 ) ; - A Phase I study patient uveitis treat subcutaneous efalizumab injection 1mg/kg patient uveitic macular edema currently enrol ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT00280826 ) - Combination therapy iCAM-1 inhibitor anti-VEGF agent may offer increased treatment benefit management age-related macular degeneration .</detailed_description>

Had prior treatment Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) . Had treatment antiVEGF agent within 30 day prior BSL . Had treatment Kenalog within 6 month prior BSL . Had treatment Dexamethaosne within 30 day prior BSL . Had ocular surgery within past 60 day study eye . Concurrent use two therapy glaucoma . Uncontrolled glaucoma study eye ( defined intraocular pressure &gt; 30 mm Hg despite treatment antiglaucoma medication ) . Concurrent use systemic antiVEGF agent Has active infection study eye . Inability obtain photographs document CNV . Has receive investigational therapy within 60 day prior study entry . Patients significantly compromise visual acuity study eye due concomitant ocular condition . Have history hypersensitivity efalizumab component Current history prior treatment psoriasis subcutaneous efalizumab within 6 month study entry . Have history ongoing uncontrolled serious bacterial , viral , fungal , atypical mycobacterial infection . This include diagnosis require 2 week therapy , endocarditis osteomyelitis , treat past 6 month . In addition , subject currently receive antibiotic , antiviral , antifungal infection suppression prophylaxis diagnosis .
