	<criteria>1 . The patient demonstrate Grade I Grade II degenerative spondylolisthesis exhibit maximum slippage flexion extension radiograph symptom include back pain and/or leg pain spinal fusion indicate , spinal instability evidence great 3 mm translational motion great 10 degree angular motion involve vertebrae evidence flexionextension radiograph . 2 . This surgery primary fusion attempt three ( 3 ) vertebra 2 disc space involve . 3 . The patient must available yearly followup study completion 24 month evaluation . 4 . The patient must skeletally mature ( epiphysis close ) . 5 . Bone graft material must limit autograft and/or bonebank allograft . 6 . The patient must willing comply treatment regimen , followup requirement , legal ability give inform consent . 1 . Patients supplemental spinal internal fixation device previously implant level and/or previous fusion attempt involve level ( ) ( interbody fusion , salvage procedure , prior hardware ) . 2 . Patients pathology involve spinal level , e.g. , osteomyelitis , Paget 's disease , pathologic fracture , etc . 3 . Patients disease entity condition totally preclude possibility bony fusion know active cancer , etc . 4 .
