	<brief_summary>The objective pilot study test feasibility large plan trial . The objective large trial determine extent aspects circadian rhythmicity , include , sleep/wake rhythm , daily social routine ( i.e. , social rhythm ) , circadian type ( morningness/eveningness ) , endogenous circadian rhythm polymorphism associate altered circadian function specific gene ( namely , CLOCK , Period 2 Period 3 ) moderate treatment response bipolar disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study small scale pilot study use support large trial . The major aim large study determine extent aspect circadian rhythmicity , include , sleep/wake rhythm , daily social routine ( i.e. , social rhythm ) , circadian type ( morningness/eveningness ) , endogenous circadian rhythm polymorphism associate altered circadian function specific gene ( namely , CLOCK , Period 2 Period 3 ) moderate treatment response bipolar disorder . The overarch aim study clarify nature rhythm abnormality bipolar disorder , especially , relation clinical state . We propose context randomize intervention protocol half subject receive treatment aim rhythm regularization . We expect study individual range circadian sleep-wake abnormality , social rhythm disturbance , circadian type examine extent parameter predict subject ' clinical outcome . Since one half subject receive IPSRT part treatment regimen ( increase regularity social routine goal treatment ) , able examine extent change social rhythm regularity sleep quality associate clinical functional improvement whether outcome mediate change endogenous circadian rhythm .</detailed_description>
