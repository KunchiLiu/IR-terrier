	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Neutropenic Diet Pediatric Oncology Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically , many intervention try reduce incidence infection reduce patient ' exposure potential pathogen . The neutropenic diet one intervention intend reduce introduction bacteria host 's gastrointestinal tract . This diet exclude food consider high risk bacterial colonization , especially raw fruit vegetable . The study evaluate diet use intervention combination germ free environment , phase practice , independent effect diet remain unknown . In addition , pediatric oncology patient suffer significant gastrointestinal side effect secondary cancer therapy , likely affect satisfaction dietary regimen . Qualitative data child suggest decreased pleasure food major concern preliminary data neutropenic diet show although patient able stick , find difficult . The Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) offer liberalize food safety guideline immunocompromised patient . We hypothesize neutropenic dietary restriction offer advantage FDA CDC endorse food safety guideline food safety guideline afford patient improve quality life increase choice control diet . The result study could potentially modify clinical practice improve quality life patient without adverse effect rate infection . Furthermore , allowance fresh fruit vegetable back diet patient may positive impact health .</detailed_description>
