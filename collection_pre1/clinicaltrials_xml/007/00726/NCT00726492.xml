	<brief_title>An Examination Value Shortwave Diathermy Hydrotherapy Patients With Osteoarthritis Their Knees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis common disable disorder increase prevalence advance age ( Blixen Kippes , 1999 ) . As rapid increase percentage people 55 year Western country ( Okma-Keulen Hopman-Rock , 2001 ) become increasingly important address issue relate old people . In 2010 , project percentage population age 60 year old Europe approximately 25 % . The increased incidence arthritis among old people , significant health care problem today , set become even great concern come year ( Reginster , 2002 ) . Rheumatic disease huge encumbrance health care system country worldwide account significant disability , lose productivity reduction quality life ( Sangha , 2000 ) . The burden disease relate prevalence also cost disease health care system country , cost include direct cost , cost associate drug , medical care , hospital , research , pension benefit indirect cost , premature mortality chronic disability ( Reginster , 2002 ) . Neither census statistic statistics Department Health Children reveal true prevalence osteoarthritis Ireland . A search also carry use Hospital Inpatient Enquiry ( HIPE ) system The Economic Social Research Institute Ireland ( ESRI ) likewise reveal frequency osteoarthritis population . Osteoarthritis characterise progressive loss articular cartilage , appositional subchondral bone development osteophyte formation joint margin . The result pain , stiffness functional limitation ( Jakobsson Hallberb , 2002 ) lead diminish quality life . The knee particularly common site involvement osteoarthritis . Osteoarthritic knee pain find associate poor perceive health significant disability , psychological distress strongly associate pain disability ( O'Reilly et al , 1998 ; Sangha , 2000 ) . Restricted knee joint mobility , particular flexion appear important determinant disability patient osteoarthritis ( Steultjens et al , 2000 ) . Minor et al ( 1999 ) note low extremity impairment old adult link reduced ability use public transportation , climb stair , perform household chore , shop engage leisure activity . Similarly van Barr ( 1998 ) note disability patient low limb osteoarthritis significantly relate pain joint range motion . Due chronic nature osteoarthritis , physical modality , lifestyle modification patient self-management term education exercise consider important approach treatment ( Sangha , 2000 ) . Physiotherapists important role play clinical management osteoarthritis ( Green et al , 1993 ) however , effect involvement rarely assess term randomise control trial . Chard et al ( 2000 ) examine research output relation number physiotherapy intervention available patient osteoarthritis knee establish 1950 1998 60 research article publish , majority occur 1985 1998 . Advice ( Maurer et al , 1999 ; Manek Lane , 2000 ) exercise ( Puett Griffin , 1994 ; Clarke , 1999 ; O'Reilly et al , 1999 ) clearly identify beneficial term relieve impairment experienced individual knee osteoarthritis . Indeed evidence support use number physiotherapy intervention include hydrotherapy ( Ahern et al , 1995 ; Norton et al 1997 ; Alexander et al , 2001 ) continuous short-wave diathermy ( CSWD ) ( Wright , 1964 ; Lankhorst et al , 1982 ) treatment knee osteoarthritis difficulty regard design many study thus undermine conclusion draw . This study present result randomise controlled factorial trial ( Polger Thomas , 2000 ) design examine hydrotherapy and/or continuous short wave diathermy ( CSWD ) patient knee osteoarthritis also examine perception patient participate physiotherapy programme .</detailed_description>
