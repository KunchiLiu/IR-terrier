	<brief_summary>Inadequate feeding infant toddler impair physical cognitive development major contributor early childhood infectious disease illnesses preventable mortality . Optimal feed two broad component : Exclusive breast feeding ( EBF ) first-6 month follow continue breast feed accompany complementary food ( CF ) adequate quantity quality . While EBF theoretically straightforward , CF complex . This CF typically limit mainly entirely plant-based food develop country worldwide . Dependence adequate , affordable locally-produced food complete CF require inexpensive , regular source meat especially provide 'problem ' micronutrient , notably , , zinc bioavailable iron . While use micronutrient-fortified CF supplement , include SprinklesTM , spread , efficacy largely remain uncertain availability , particularly sustainable , affordable basis Achievement widespread regular use meat CF require : ( 1 ) adequate local production affordable small scavenging/foraging animal poor rural , feasible , periurban community worldwide ; ( 2 ) effective communication behavioral change/education young child , start age 6 month ( meat readily accept infant ) , receive priority use meat . Solid scientific evidence value international/national program achieve goal essential provide basis incentive major international national program promote feed meat early regular CF . The acquisition evidence goal study The intervention evaluate meat feed daily complementary food age 6-18 month . Thirty infants-toddlers 60 rural community ( total 1,800 subject ) participate . In cluster design , twenty community ( test ) randomize receive meat , twenty community ( control ) receive plant recipe provide amount calorie , twenty community ( fortified cereal ) receive commercially available fortified cereal provide amount calorie . This project locate rural China county high quality collaboration already establish , recently demonstrate inadequate bioavailable zinc intake zinc deficiency toddler . We also find high ( 30 % ) incidence stunting , widely use indirect indicator population zinc deficiency . Other advantage location include willingness doctor locate rural community provide test control meal 7 day per week home absence access supplement / fortify product could complicate interpretation data . The young child test community receive certify safe lean pork 7 day per wk . Starting small quantity 6 month , quantity lean pork increase infant ready take plateau 2 oz/d . No subsequent increase plan neither zinc iron requirement increase 6-11 month 12-18 month . Lean pork use pig ubiquitous China maintain cheaply scavenging/foraging waste material adjacent human habitation . Test control cluster also receive nutrition education achieve maximal diversification locally available affordable food . Longitudinal outcome measure include index physical growth , especially length ; infectious disease incidence prevalence ; cognitive development ; zinc iron intake biomarkers micronutrient . Zinc absorption measure .

	<brief_title>Development Health Rural Chinese Children Fed Meat Daily Complementary Food From 6-18 Mos Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The goal project determine efficacy daily intake locally available , low cost meat complementary food young child age 6-18 month otherwise dependent continue breast feeding locally available non-fortified plant food . Efficacy determine public health outcome , include infectious disease morbidity physical cognitive development , linear growth primary outcome measure . Other outcome measure require interpretation result food nutrient intake ; biomarkers key micronutrient status ; zinc absorption measure host factor might compromise effect optimize nutrition . Rationale Inadequate complementary feeding ( CF ) major contributor preventable morbidity mortality young child develop world . Except emergency situation , inadequate macronutrient intake largely attributable lack adequate maternal knowledge , optimal micronutrient intake depend food diversity . Though food fortification program diminish possibly eradicate need food diversity , reliable source affordable fortified foods/supplements frequently unavailable efficacy always certain . Locally grown , nutritionally complete affordable source CF remain key strategy especially million rural poor . Adequate food diversity depend meat provide adequate zinc also favorable source bioavailable iron , addition assure sufficient intake key micronutrient , e.g . vitamin B12 . Meat 's theoretical benefit CF , however , test adequately . Clear demonstration public health benefit essential support policy promote local production adequate , affordable small foraging animal priority use old infants/toddlers . The long-term goal achieve nutritionally complete complementary feeding affordable local source million poor rural/semi-rural young child worldwide . Methods The project unmask randomize control trial cluster design 60 rural village community , 30 infant , within County Xi-Chou , Wen-Shan , Yunnan Province , SW China randomly select randomly assign intervention control cluster . The intervention meat feed daily age 6-18 month . Control participants receive equi-caloric rice-based supplement commercially available fortified rice cereal . The intervention team include 80 community doctor , supervise support senior staff Xi-Chou Women 's Children 's Hospital . This senior staff also responsible purchase quality intervention food . The intervention meat certify safe pork , pig ubiquitous rural China maintain cheaply foraging/scavenging . Lean pork , increase accept plateau 2 oz/d , provide meat-rice recipe daily community doctor ' home ; food remain feed home later day . Control child receive daily plant-based recipe fortify rice cereal also community doctor ' home . Starting time recruitment age 3 month , monthly nutrition education message give mother . Initially focus exclusive breast feeding ; 6 month age , education test control cluster focus optimize diversity locally available , affordable complementary food responsive feeding ( message design increase energy intake require population ) . Specially trained local Shanghai health research team obtain longitudinal outcome measure 6-18 month . Outcomes include : anthropometry 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 18 month ; daily record infectious disease morbidity ( kept community doctor ) ; Bayley Scales Infant Development III 6 , 12 , 18 month plus WHO motor questionnaire ; 24-hr dietary recall data 6 , 7 , 9 , 12 , 15 18 month ; biomarkers , subsample , measurement zinc absorption gut function 6 , 9 18 month . Data transfer daily local research base Xi-Chou Women Children 's Hospital , check accuracy enter data management system . These data transfer weekly data manager Shanghai Jiao Tong University , School Medicine , Xin-Hua Hospital . Data collate share Colorado research group 3-monthly interval . SAS software use range outcome-specific statistical measure . Significance Positive outcomes meat group versus control provide scientific justification promotion production affordable small animal meat globally rural/semi-rural even peri-urban community communication behavioral change/education provide meat regular complementary feed age 6 month .</detailed_description>
