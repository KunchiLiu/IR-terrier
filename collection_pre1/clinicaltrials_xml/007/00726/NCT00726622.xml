	<brief_summary>This study do compare two type surgery currently use rectal cancer . The two type surgery laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection open laparotomy rectal resection . Although laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection use rectal cancer medical center , effectiveness type surgery compare open surgery unknown . The study compare safety effectiveness surgery , recovery surgery hospital , overall recovery surgery cancer outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic-Assisted Resection Open Resection Treating Patients With Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter study . Patients eligible trial complete 5FU base neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation therapy per institution 's standard care IRB approve clinical trial . Patients may registered/randomized anytime completion neoadjuvant therapy , surgery must occur within 4-12 week ( 28-84 day ) completion neoadjuvant therapy . Patients stratify accord site primary tumor ( high , middle low rectum ) , register surgeon , plan operative procedure ( low anterior resection abdominal perineal resection ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Please see arm section detail . The primary secondary objective list . Primary Objective : To test hypothesis laparoscopic-assisted resection rectal cancer inferior open rectal resection , base composite primary endpoint oncologic factor indicative safe feasible operation . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To assess patient-related benefit laparoscopic-assisted resection rectal cancer vs. open rectal resection ( blood loss , length stay , pain medicine utilization ) 2 . To assess disease free survival local pelvic recurrence two year . 3 . To assess quality life , sexual function , bowel stoma function schedule time point throughout trial . Patients evaluate surgery determine need subsequent care base final pathology . Patients start treatment investigative trial involve intervention invasive diagnostic procedure ≤ 30 day follow surgery enable complete evaluation post-operative adverse event complication occur within 30 day surgery . Patients follow periodically 5 year post surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria : 1 . Histologic diagnosis adenocarcinoma rectum ( ≤ 12 cm anal verge ) 2 . T3 , N0 , M0 , T13 , N12 , M0 disease determine preneoadjuvant therapy CT scan pelvic MRI transrectal ultrasound . Patients T4 disease eligible . 3 . Completion preoperative 5FU base chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy . Capecitabine may substitute 5FU . 4 . Age ≥ 18 year 5 . ECOG ( Zubrod ) Performance Status ≤ 2 6 . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) ≤ 34 7 . No evidence condition would preclude use laparoscopic approach ( eg , multiple previous major laparotomy , severe adhesion ) 8 . No systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic ) would preclude surgery . No severe incapacitate disease : ASA IV : A patient severe systemic disease constant threat life . OR ASA V : A moribund patient expect survive without operation . 9 . No concurrent previous invasive pelvic malignancy ( cervical , uterine rectal ) within five year prior registration 10 . No history psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement . NOTE : Incompetent patient eligible trial .</criteria>
