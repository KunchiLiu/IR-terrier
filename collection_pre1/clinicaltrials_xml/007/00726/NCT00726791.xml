	<brief_summary>Chronic somatoform pain common psychiatric patient . Chronic somatoform pain cause significant distress disrupts social functioning . Moreover , chronic somatoform pain often sufficiently respond medication . Chronic somatoform pain associate medial pain system . The medial pain system comprise structure engage affect motivation , medial thalamus limbic structure . The medial pain system get inhibitory control motor cortex . Functional neuroimaging study indicate chronic somatoform pain associate hypoactivity motor cortex , defective inhibitory process , hyperactivity medial pain system . Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) safe non-invasive tool modulate neurophysiologic activity focal brain . Therefore , pain relief rTMS obtain motor cortex stimulation , restoration defective inhibitory process , deactivation medial pain system . Studies show motor cortex stimulation use rTMS relieve pain patient neuropathic pain . However , knowledge , rTMS study chronic somatoform pain psychiatric patient . The purpose study evaluate effect motor cortex rTMS chronic somatoform pain .</brief_summary>
