	<brief_summary>This study design compare femoral perineural catheter insertion distance , order help determine best pain relief knee surgery . Hypothesis : quality femoral nerve block inferior catheter insert deeper ( 7cm compare 3 cm )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insertion Distance Femoral Perineural Catheters Context Major Knee Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain knee surgery report severe 60 % patient , major concern hospitalise ambulatory surgery patient . Pain control particularly important , adequate analgesia allow rapid mobilisation operate knee prevents complication related immobility . Several method propose treat pain , promise injection local anesthetic close femoral nerve . The injection local anesthetic around femoral nerve reduces sensation knee provide well pain relief surgery narcotic medication . To prolong duration analgesia , small catheter must position next nerve . Through catheter , small quantity local anesthetic continuously deliver several hour surgery , effectively relieve bad pain . To date , administration local anesthetic catheter next femoral nerve show improve pain relief knee replacement surgery . These pain relief benefit result faster recovery total knee replacement . Until recently , catheter technique frequently use due technical difficulty encounter attempt find femoral nerve , well difficulty relate catheter displacement surgery . Due recent improvement nerve catheter localisation , catheter installation become easier , precise reliable . However , distance catheter must advance next femoral nerve order provide best pain relief remain unknown . Insertion distance could influence initial quality distribution freezing , duration , . Therefore , study design compare two catheter insertion distance , order help determine best pain relief knee surgery . Patients randomly assign follow group : - Group 1 : 3 cm insertion - Group 2 : 7 cm insertion The anesthesiologist insert catheter close femoral nerve , junction thigh torso immediately begin anesthesia surgery . The usual medication use make installation comfortable . The exact location catheter put place identify use ultrasound machine . This device allow anesthesiologist identify various anatomical structure . A specially design needle insert next femoral nerve , position confirm neurostimulator . Once adequacy needle position confirm , anesthesiologist introduce 3 cm ( Group 1 ) 7 cm ( Group 2 ) catheter needle , withdraw needle . The catheter fix place avoid displacement . Patients receive standard regional general anesthesia type surgery . After surgery , pain assess use verbal numeric pain scale . A Patient Controlled Analgesia pump provide patient . In addition , patient receive local anesthetic femoral catheter least 24 hour surgery , partially freeze knee . Patients ask fill pain intensity measurement form use 0-10 pain scale 3 , 6 24 hour surgery .</detailed_description>
