	<brief_summary>This study compare immune response side effect experimental HIV vaccine give two different method administration needle injection use needle-free device call Biojector 2000 ( Registered Trademark ) . The vaccine , call VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP , rAd5 , make use adenovirus modify contain DNA cod three HIV protein . It cause HIV adenoviral infection . Healthy volunteer infect HIV virus may eligible study . Subjects recruit two study group : Group 1 comprise volunteer 18 50 year old never receive HIV vaccine Group 2 comprise volunteer 18 55 year old participate prior study receive least one injection study rAd5 vaccine . Subjects group randomly assign receive vaccine needle Biojector 2000 ( Registered Trademark ) muscle upper arm . They call study nurse 2 day injection , record temperature symptom diary card home 5 day injection later review , visit clinic two week injection checkup . The injection give day enrollment . Additional visit schedule week 2 , 4 , 12 24 , subject check health change problem , use medication feel . Blood sample collect clinic visit . Subjects test HIV begin end study , ask sexual behavior drug use , counsel HIV risk reduction . Women test pregnancy begin end study . Participants Group 2 may undergo apheresis 4-week visit . This procedure do collect white blood cell test examine immune response vaccine . Blood collect needle vein one arm direct machine separate cell component . The white cell remove rest blood return needle . Subjects ask social effect may experience participate study . These effect monitor make sure participant receive need assistance learn way prevent problem future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study HIV Adenoviral Vector Vaccine Healthy Subjects Using Needle Biojector Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : VRC 015 examine safety , tolerability immune response VRC recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 5 vector vaccine , VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP ( rAd5 ) , uninfected subject randomize receive injection either needle Biojector injection . The study include enrollment rAd5 vaccine-naive subject , well enrollment rollover subject receive least one rAd5 injection prior study include rAd5 vaccine . The hypothesis rAd5 vaccine safe immunogenic administer either needle Biojector . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability rAd5 vaccine 10 ( 10 ) PU dosage naive previously vaccinate , uninfected subject administer needle Biojectors . The secondary objective include evaluate HIV-1-specific humoral T-cell immune response adenovirus serotype 5 ( Ad5 ) antibody response , social impact participation HIV vaccine study . Exploratory evaluation include epitope mapping immunogenicity evaluation . Product Description : The VRC HIV rAd5 vaccine recombinant product compose 4 adenoviral vector ( 3:1:1:1 ratio ) encode HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein clade B HIV-1 Env glycoproteins clades A , B , C , respectively . Subjects : Group 1 include healthy adult , age 18-50 year old HIV vaccine-naive . Group 2 include healthy adult , age 18-55 year old , rollover enrollment prior study VRC HIV rAd5 vaccine . Study Plan : Study Group 1 Group 2 simultaneously enrol . Both group randomize 1:1 ratio receive study injection needle Biojector . All study injection dosage 10 ( 10 ) particle unit ( PU ) rAd5 vaccine deliver deltoid muscle . There 100 past study participant potentially eligible Group 2 . The study design base least 10 rollover subject , allow additional rollover enrollment 10 ( i.e. , Group 2 total n=20 ) great expect interest participation . The sample immunogenicity study collect Week 4 vaccination Group 2 subject obtain apheresis willing eligible apheresis ; otherwise peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) obtain 80 mL blood collect phlebotomy . Study Duration : Subjects evaluate 5 clinical visit 24 week study injection follow annual clinic telephone mail contact subsequent 4 year .</detailed_description>
