	<brief_title>Adding Maraviroc Antiretroviral Therapy Suboptimal CD4 T-Cell Recovery Despite Sustained Virologic Suppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority HIV-infected subject virologic suppression antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) mark increase CD4+ T-cell count first year treatment . However , portion individual show suboptimal immune response remain elevated risk disease progression . The use CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc ( MVC ) associate enhanced CD4+ T-cell recovery subject initiate ART . AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( ACTG ) A5256 study effect ART intensification MVC CD4+ T-cell count subject suboptimal CD4 recovery despite sustained virologic suppression . Eligible subject add MVC ART regimen , continue MVC 24 week . At week 24 , subject discontinue MVC follow additional 24 week MVC . Subjects see week 48 clinical laboratory evaluation , include plasma HIV-1 RNA , CD4+ T-cell count , safety laboratory . Subjects 2 baseline visit prior start MVC . Study visit schedule week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 22 , 24 , 36 , 46 , 48 . CD4+ T-cell count measure every study visit HIV-1 RNA week 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , regardless treatment status . Measures activation , T-cell maturation , apoptosis perform week except 4 , 8 , 16 . At end study , pre-entry , entry , week 12 , 22 , 24 , 36 sample HIV-1 RNA single-copy assay ( SCA ) run . The week 46 48 sample run .</detailed_description>
