	<brief_summary>Patients study type lymph gland cancer call non-Hodgkin Lymphoma chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia . Their lymphoma CLL come back go away treatment . Because standard treatment cancer time currently use treatment work fully case , patient ask volunteer take part gene transfer research study use special immune cell . The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease : antibody T cell . Antibodies type protein protect body infectious diseases possibly cancer . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include cell infected virus tumor cell . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer . They show promise , strong enough cure patient . The antibody use study call anti-CD19 . This antibody stick lymphoma cell substance outside cell call CD19 . CD19 antibody use treat people lymphoma CLL . For study , anti-CD19 antibody change instead float free blood attach T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . These chimeric receptor-T cell seem able kill tumor , n't last long chance fight cancer limit . Investigators find T cell work well also attach protein call CD28 T cell . This protein make T cell active survive longer . Also find T cell also train recognize virus cause infectious mononucleosis ( call Epstein Barr Virus EBV ) stay blood stream many year . These CD19-CD28 chimeric receptor T cell CD19 chimeric-EBV specific T cell investigational product approve FDA . The purpose study find big dose chimeric T cell safe administer , see long T cell population ( CD19-CD28 CD19-EBV-specific ) last , assess side effect , evaluate whether therapy might help people lymphoma CLL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient donor give u blood make CD19-CD28 chimeric receptor T cell CD19 chimeric-EBV specific T cell laboratory . These cell grow frozen patient . Because patient receive cell new gene follow total 15 year see long term side effect gene transfer . The patient assign dose CD19-CD28 chimeric receptor-T cell CD19 chimeric receptor-EBV specific T cell . Several study suggest infuse T cell need room able proliferate accomplish function may happen many T cell circulation . Because , patient 's level circulating T cell relatively high , receive one treatment cyclophosphamide . This drug decrease number patient 's T cell infusion CD19 chimeric receptor T cell . Although 's expected effect tumor dose subject receive , drug part many regimen use treat lymphoma CLL . If subject already receive chemotherapy , may need . The patient give injection cell vein IV line assign dose . The patient follow clinic injection 3 hour . If 4-6 week evaluation period infusion , patient seem experience benefit ( confirmed radiological study , physical exam and/or symptom ) , may able receive three additional dos T cell . These additional infusion would least 4-6 week apart dose level patient receive first time .</detailed_description>
