	<brief_summary>The consolidation learning enhance adrenalin stress hormone . This memory enhance effect oppose propranolol . In posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , psychologically traumatic event may overstimulate stress hormone adrenalin , turn overly strengthen consolidation memory event , lead excessively powerful persistent memory . Administration propranolol psychologically traumatic event could reduce subsequent PTSD . Unfortunately , exist window opportunity influence consolidation traumatic event long-term memory . In person already develop PTSD , would close month year earlier . However , recent development animal research suggest reactivation ( retrieval ) consolidate memory return labile state , must restabilized order persist . This process , term `` reconsolidation , '' reduce animal propranolol . In preliminary study perform PI colleague Canada , civilian participant PTSD describe traumatic event script preparation session , serve reactivate traumatic memory . They receive either propranolol placebo . A week later , script-driven imagery traumatic event , physiologic response small participant receive post-reactivation propranolol compare placebo , suggest traumatic memory weaken propranolol . These result suggest post-reactivation propranolol recapitulate effect consolidation , time block reconsolidation traumatic memory . Several important question remain unanswered . First , propranolol also weaken traumatic memory combat-related PTSD ? Second , weaken effect occur propranolol give combat memory reactivation ? If , would refute reconsolidation hypothesis suggest propranolol affect non-specific mechanism . Third , long traumatic memory weaken last ? The propose project investigate question perform improved , double-blind , placebo-controlled study Iraq Afghanistan veterans combat-related PTSD . Participants randomly assign one two group : post-reactivation propranolol non-reactivation propranolol . Participants non-reactivation propranolol group receive propranolol absence traumatic memory reactivation . Participants randomize post-reactivation propranolol group receive match placebo capsule . Two day later , participant return script preparation session , time describe detail traumatic event . Participants randomize post-reactivation propranolol group receive propranolol , whereas participant randomize non-reactivation propranolol group receive placebo . Participants return psychophysiologic script-driven imagery test one week six month later . We hypothesize receive propranolol reactivation memory traumatic combat event ( ) show significantly small psychophysiologic response script-driven imagery test compare participant receive propranolol absence combat memory reactivation , support inference post-reactivation propranolol block reconsolidation traumatic combat memory .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Psychophysiologic Study Weakening Traumatic Combat Memories With Post-Reactivation Propranolol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Animal evidence indicates consolidated memory reactivate ( retrieve ) need reconsolidated . During process , memory enhance weaken . In preliminary , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , test whether post-reactivation administration beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol , reduce reconsolidation aversive memory rodent , would reduce emotional strength traumatic memory , condition fear response , patient non-combat-related PTSD . Civilian participant describe traumatic event `` script preparation '' session thereafter receive either combine dose short- long-acting propranolol ( n=9 ) , placebo ( n=10 ) . A week later , engage script-driven mental imagery personal traumatic event , peripheral physiologic response record measure emotional strength traumatic memory . We find physiologic response significantly small participant receive post-reactivation propranolol compare placebo week earlier : F ( 3,15 ) =5.1 , p=.007 , η2=.49 . The result preliminary study consistent pharmacologic blockade reconsolidation traumatic memory PTSD . However , several important question remain unanswered . First , propranolol also weaken traumatic memory combat-related PTSD ? Second , weaken effect occur propranolol give combine traumatic memory reactivation ? If , would refute reconsolidation hypothesis suggest propranolol affect non-specific mechanism . Third , long traumatic memory weaken last , i.e. , recovery condition fear response occur ? Objective/Hypothesis : The first objective replicate extend find preliminary study Iraq Afghanistan combat veteran PTSD show propranolol follow combat memory reactivation result significantly great weaken traumatic combat memory propranolol alone , support proposition weaken due pharmacological blockade memory reconsolidation , rather non-specific action propranolol . We hypothesize participant undergo script preparation combat event ( ) cause PTSD , follow ( post-reactivation ) propranolol , show significantly small psychophysiologic response script-driven imagery test week later compare receive ( non-reactivation ) propranolol two day prior combat script preparation . The second objective show effect long-lasting , would expect underlying mechanism reduction traumatic memory trace blockade reconsolidation . We hypothesize effect remain significant participant undergo follow-up psychophysiologic script-driven imagery test six month later . Specific Aim : To perform control , randomize , double-blind study Iraq Afghanistan veterans combat-related PTSD address hypothesis . Study Design : Participants randomly assign one two group : post-reactivation propranolol non-reactivation propranolol . After write informed consent obtain , participant randomize non-reactivation propranolol group receive `` test '' dose 0.67 mg/kg short-acting propranolol combine 1 mg/kg long-acting propranolol . Participants randomize post-reactivation propranolol group receive match placebo capsule . Two day later , participant return approximate 15-30 minute `` script preparation '' session , time describe detail traumatic combat event ( ) Principal Investigator . Participants randomize post-reactivation propranolol group receive combine propranolol dose , whereas participant randomize non-reactivation propranolol group receive placebo . Based upon history obtain script preparation session , Principal Investigator compose `` script '' approximately 30 second duration portray participant 's combat event word . Participants return script-driven imagery test session psychophysiology laboratory one week six month later . During session , undergo record heart rate , skin conductance , corrugator frontalis electromyogram baseline period . They listen record traumatic script instruct imagine event portray happen , physiologic measure record . Responses ( change ) score physiologic variable session calculate subtract precede baseline period mean imagery period mean . The physiologic data analyze multivariate analysis variance ( MANOVA ) follow univariate ANOVAs . The hypothesis predict time period , physiologic response post-reactivation propranolol group significantly small non-reactivation propranolol group . Relevance : If traumatic memory undergoes reconsolidation reactivate , could re-open window opportunity influence memory pharmacologically . This could important implication treatment PTSD . Should propose psychophysiologic study confirm post-reactivation propranolol weaken traumatic combat memory , would relatively short leap clinical study therapeutic efficacy novel modality .</detailed_description>
