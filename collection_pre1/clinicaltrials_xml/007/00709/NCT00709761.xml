	<brief_summary>This open-label , single-arm , multi-center , Phase II study determine activity nab-paclitaxel plus lapatinib first second-line set woman ErbB2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . Sixty subject enrol study . Subjects receive nab-paclitaxel ( 100 mg/m2 intravenously weekly 3 week , follow rest week 4-week cycle ) plus lapatinib ( 1000 mg daily ) . Subjects receive treatment disease progression withdrawal study . The primary objective study evaluate overall tumor response rate lapatinib combination nab-paclitaxel administered woman ErbB2 overexpressing MBC receive chemotherapeutic regimen metastatic setting . Secondary objective include progression-free survival , overall survival , duration response , time response time progression safety . Safety efficacy assessment perform 8 12 week interval , end treatment . Subject : Metastatic Breast Cancer , ErbB2 , First-line therapy , Lapatinib , Nab-paclitaxel</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Subjects must histologically confirm invasive breast cancer Stage IV disease primary diagnosis relapse curativeintent surgery . Where disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature lesion confirm cytology histology . Documented amplification ErbB2 3+ immunohistochemistry positive score ( &gt; 2.2 ) FISH use local laboratory result ( consider sufficient study verification central laboratory ) . Subjects must receive one prior chemotherapeutic regimen metastatic setting . If taxane administer neoadjuvant , adjuvant metastatic setting , progression must occur ≥12 month completion treatment . Prior therapy radiation breast cancer population permit administered neoadjuvant adjuvant non metastatic setting . Radiotherapy give metastatic setting , prior initiation study medication , allow limited area ( e.g. , palliative therapy involve less 25 % bone marrow ) , sole site disease . Subjects must complete radiation treatment recover acute radiation treatment related toxicity ( e.g. , bone marrow suppression ) prior commencement combination treatment . The subject must receive prior chemotherapy treatment least 4 week prior enrollment study must recover related toxicity . Subjects receive weekly dose prior chemotherapy e.g . gemcitabine capecitabine may enroll 2 3 week cessation treatment provide recover related toxicity . Prior therapy trastuzumab neoadjuvant , adjuvant metastatic setting permit . The subject must receive prior trastuzumab treatment least 4 week prior enrollment study must recover related toxicity . Prior endocrine therapy permit neoadjuvant adjuvant metastatic setting . The subject must receive prior endocrine treatment least 1 week prior enrollment study must recover related toxicity . Prior diagnosis cancer allow long subject free disease 5 year . Subjects completely resect basal squamous cell skin cancer , thyroid cancer successfully treat cervical carcinoma insitu allow 1 year great since definitive surgery . Subjects must measurable disease , accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) guideline ; define least 1 lesion accurately measure least 1 dimension ( long diameter [ LD ] record ) mammogram , ultrasound physical exam [ Therasse , 2000 ] . Subjects liver metastasis stable chronic liver disease permit study . Women ≥18 year age : Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , woman function ovary current document tubal ligation hysterectomy , woman postmenopausal ) ; Childbearing potential ( i.e. , woman function ovary document impairment oviductal uterine function would cause sterility ) . This category include woman oligomenorrhoea ( severe ) , woman perimenopausal young woman begin menstruate . These subject must provide negative serum pregnancy test Screening agree 1 follow : Complete abstinence intercourse 2 week prior administration first dose study medication 5 day final dose study medication ; Consistent correct use 1 follow acceptable method birth control : Male partner sterile prior female subject 's entry study sole sexual partner female subject . Implants levonorgestrel . Injectable progestogen . Any intrauterine device document failure rate le 1 % per year . Oral contraceptive ( either combine progestogen ) . Barrier method , include diaphragm condom spermicide . Considered Investigator life expectancy ≥6 month . ECOG Performance Status ( PS ) 0 1 ( Karnofsky ≥80 % ) [ Oken , 1982 ] . Subjects must normal organ marrow function define Table 3 : CONFIDENTIAL UM2007/00382/01 LPT111111 28 Table 3 Baseline Laboratory Values Adequate Organ Function Hematologic Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Platelets ≥100 × 10^9/L Hepatic Serum bilirubin ≤ upper limit normal ( ULN ) Aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase ≤3 × ULN without liver metastasis ≤5 × ULN document liver metastasis Renal Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL OR Calculated creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min Subjects must cardiac ejection fraction &gt; 50 % measure echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) within institutional range normal . Subjects stable central nervous system metastasis ( stable least 3 month ) confirm computerized tomography ( CT ) /magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evidence leptomeningeal involvement eligible take steroid enzymeinducing anticonvulsant . Subject must free gastrointestinal disease impede swallow retain oral medication . Signed , inform consent prior registration . Bisphosphonate therapy bone metastases allow ; however , treatment must initiate prior first dose study medication . Prophylactic use bisphosphonates subject without bone disease , except treatment osteoporosis , permit . Subjects whose disease estrogen receptor + and/or progesterone receptor + unknown status include study meet follow criterion : They symptomatic visceral disease require chemotherapy . Significant visceral organ tumor burden The disease consider Investigator progress rapidly life threaten . Subjects receive prior endocrine therapy longer benefit therapy . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Subjects receive one prior chemotherapeutic regimen metastatic set Subjects take treatment medication provide list restricted medication substance drug information section lapatinib eligible study ( Section 5.11.2 ) . This include human immunodeficiency viruspositive subject receive combination antiretroviral therapy possible pharmacokinetic interaction lapatinib . Prior treatment lapatinib . Concurrent anticancer concomitant radiotherapy treatment ; Concurrent treatment prohibit medication ( Section 5.11.2 ) ; Use investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose investigational treatment , , concurrent treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial involve investigational agent . Known history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition lapatinib nabpaclitaxel excipients ; Known history uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Have current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety . Pregnant lactate female time study ( due potential teratogenic abortifacient effect lapatinib breastfeed ) . Subjects diseases affect gastrointestinal function result inability take oral medication , include ; malabsorption syndrome , requirement iv alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption e.g . gastric resection uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's , ulcerative colitis ) . Peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 great . Unresolved unstable , serious toxicity prior administration another investigational drug and/or prior cancer treatment . History prior malignancy . However , subject diseasefree 5 year , subject completely resect basal squamous cell skin cancer , thyroid cancer successfully treat cervical carcinoma situ eligible least 1 year since definitive surgery . render informed consent . Other Eligibility Criteria Considerations : To assess potential impact subject eligibility regard safety , Investigator must refer follow document ( ) detail information regard warning , precaution , contraindication , AEs , significant data pertain investigational product ( ) use study : Clinical Investigator 's Brochure ( IB ) , SPM , nabpaclitaxel Product Label .</criteria>
