	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , 3-way crossover bioequivalence study single dose 250 mcg NGM/35 mcg EE without folic acid . The study consist pretreatment phase ( screening period last 21 day ) , open-label treatment phase ( consist 3 period single dose study drug administer follow 72 hour serial blood sample collection pharmacokinetic analysis ) , posttreatment phase ( consist safety evaluation completion third open-label treatment period early withdrawal ) . All healthy volunteer receive follow treatment ( 1 period ) : Treatment A : 250 mcg NGM/35 mcg EE ; Treatment B : 250 mcg NGM/35 mcg EE plus folic acid 400 mcg ( combined formulation ) ; Treatment C : folic acid 400 mcg . Healthy volunteer randomly assign 1 6 treatment sequence group ( ABC , ACB , BAC , BCA , CAB , CBA ) Day 1 first open-label treatment period . Healthy volunteer receive single dose study drug Day 1 period accord assign treatment sequence . There washout period treatment least 4 week . Healthy volunteer confine study unit even dosing ( Day -1 ) vital sign measure follow collection 24 hour ( Treatment C ) 48-hour ( Treatments A B ) postdose blood sample . Blood sample collect specified time 24 hour dose determination blood level folate 72 hour dose determination blood level norelgestromin ( NGMN ) , norgestrel ( NG ) [ active breakdown product NGM ] , EE . The total duration study , include pretreatment phase , approximately 9 week . Safety evaluate base following : incidence , type , severity adverse event ; clinical laboratory test ; vital sign electrocardiogram ( ECG ) measurement ; physical gynecological ( include breast ) examination . Oral temperature , heart rate , respiratory rate , blood pressure measure screening , dose , least 15 minute 24-hour ( treatment ) 48- 72-hour ( healthy volunteer receive Treatments A B ) pharmacokinetic blood sample period , early withdrawal . In Period 3 , end-of-study assessment consider 24-hour ( healthy volunteer receive Treatment C ) 72-hour ( healthy volunteer receive Treatments A B ) measurement . Physical gynecologic examination ECG perform screen , least 1 hour last pharmacokinetic blood sample Day 58 healthy volunteer receive Treatment C Period 3 , Day 60 healthy volunteer receive Treatments A B Period 3 , early withdrawal . Blood sample blood chemistry , hematology , urine sample urinalysis collect screening , last pharmacokinetic blood sample Day 58 healthy volunteer receive Treatment C third treatment period , Day 60 healthy volunteer receive Treatments A B Period 3 , early withdrawal .
