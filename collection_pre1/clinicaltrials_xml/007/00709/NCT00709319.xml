	<detailed_description>Study Design The study design prospective cohort study . A randomized trial design consider reject decide insufficient equipoise part investigator group randomize eye DME vitreal traction surgery surgery ( thus eye potentially may benefit vitrectomy would include ) , insufficient information available natural course surgical outcome eye DME without significant traction . A cohort study provide opportunity collect data prospectively use standardize protocol ass potential benefit risk vitrectomy . The result use determine whether proceed randomize trial merit design trial . If randomize trial conduct , result plus cohort study experience use help design protocol . Study Objectives 1 . To provide information follow outcome eyes Diabetic Macular Edema ( DME ) undergo vitrectomy : visual acuity , retinal thickening , resolution traction ( present ) , surgical complication . 2 . To identify subgroup appear benefit vitrectomy subgroup vitrectomy appear beneficial . 3 . To obtain data use plan randomize trial . B . Intervention Vitrectomy perform investigator 's usual routine . C. Duration Follow-Up : Two year D. Follow-up Visit Schedule Study visit data collection 3 6 month 1 , 2 year . Additional visit follow investigator 's usual routine . E. Rationale : There least two avenue investigation support theoretical value vitrectomy treatment DME , base ( 1 ) vitrectomy relief traction macula ( 2 ) vitrectomy improve oxygenation macula lead decreased permeability subsequent resolution decrease DME . Vitrectomy relieve biomechanical traction macula report widely . Schepens coworkers discuss role vitreous vitreomacular traction cystoid macular edema 1984 . Nasrallah et al observed 1988 resolution diabetic macular edema individual spontaneous separation vitreous gel retina . In 1992 , Lewis coworkers report success vitrectomy peel `` thicken hyaloid membrane '' eye DME anatomical feature . Since report nonrandomized retrospective case series , author prospectively analyzed series support concept relief clear-cut anteroposterior traction , usually set epiretinal membrane complex associate vitreous adherence , may ameliorate macular thicken edema DME . Evaluation individual documentation pre postoperative characteristic render vastly objective ocular coherence tomography Retina Thickness Analyzer . Series use optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) image case vitreomacular traction observe case treat , confirm clinical impression mechanical force work posterior retina document anatomic improvement surgery . How case OCT could refine ability diagnose define clinically important anatomical feature relationship investigate . As Kaiser coworkers document , OCT find case thus far come vitrectomy situation support conclusion disease process progress far many case individual actual traction retinal detachment macula . These severe case exception spectrum DME : case macular edema obvious vitreomacular traction , factor investigate adequately new sophisticated imaging technique . It possible subclinical traction macula exist large number individual diabetes , whose internal limiting membrane vitreomacular interface often thicken , hypercellular appearance whose vitreous gel , gradually contract many year , may exert subclinical significant traction compromise diabetic macular vascular bed . The line reason prior research support possibility vitrectomy would help DME articulate Steffanson others indicate posterior segment oxygenation improve vitrectomy . Using oxygen sensor retinal surface , investigator show retinal oxygen tension increase vitreous gel remove posterior segment becomes perfuse relatively oxygen-rich aqueous humor . Supporting conclusion additional observation retinal vessel decrease caliber vitrectomy , presumably response improvement hypoxia , although confound factor could contribute decrease , addition endolaser retinal photocoagulation , rule . Numerous line investigation elucidate factor produce permeability retinal blood vessel . One central factor Vascular Endothelial Growth factor ( VEGF ) , formerly know Vascular Permeability Factor ( VPF ) . VEGF know upregulated hypoxia , downregulated increased oxygenation . The speculated sequence event vitrectomy produce improved oxygenation posterior segment , lead downregulation VEGF , lead decreased vasopermeability , result reduce macular thickening , plausible one . More rapid clearing growth factor vitrectomized eye also postulate potential mechanism response . See full protocol drcr.net list reference</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjectlevel Inclusion Criteria To eligible , follow inclusion criterion ( 13 ) must meet : 1 . Age &gt; = 18 year 2 . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) 3 . Able willing provide inform consent . Subjectlevel Exclusion Criteria A patient eligible follow exclusion criterion ( 46 ) present : 4 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . 5 . Patient expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center first year study . 6 . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . Study Eye Criteria To study eye , inclusion criterion ( ae ) none exclusion criterion ( fm ) list must meet . A patient one study eye . If eye eligible undergoing vitrectomy , first eye surgery study eye . The eligibility criterion study eye follow : Inclusion 1 . Vitrectomy perform treatment DME . 2 . EETDRS visual acuity 20/800 better ( EETDRS visual acuity score &gt; = 3 letter ) . 3 . Definite retinal thickening due diabetic macular edema base clinical exam involve center macula . 4 . Presence vitreomacular traction associate macular edema OR edema felt diffuse respond focal grid laser OR edema judge inadequately responsive previous treatment ( ) unlikely benefit focal photocoagulation . 5 . Media clarity , pupillary dilation , patient cooperation sufficient adequate fundus photograph . Exclusion 6 . Macular edema consider due cause diabetic macular edema . 7 . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , visual acuity would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigmentary abnormality , subfoveal hard exudate , fibrous metaplasia , nonretinal condition ) . 8 . An ocular condition present ( diabetes ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , postsurgical cystoid macular edema , etc. ) . 9 . History retinal macular photocoagulation , intravitreal corticosteroid , treatment DME within 3.5 month prior enrollment . 10 . History peripheral scatter photocoagulation within 4 month prior enrollment anticipate need within 4 month follow enrollment . 11 . History prior par plana vitrectomy . 12 . History major ocular surgery ( include cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within prior 6 month anticipate within next 6 month follow enrollment . 13 . History YAG capsulotomy perform within 2 month prior enrollment .</criteria>
