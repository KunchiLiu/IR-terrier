	<brief_summary>This research study individual advance breast , colon , pancreatic , ovarian bladder cancer . Celldex Therapeutics , Inc. test form immune therapy ( vaccine ) see use make immune system attack cancer . The study include administration additional treatment , combination , think enhance immune response effect . ( CDX 1307-01 )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study CDX-1307 , Patients With Incurable Breast , Colorectal , Pancreatic , Ovarian Bladder Cancer ( CDX 1307-01 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol CDX1307-01 : CDX-1307 investigational drug test see stimulate immune system ( cell substance protect body infection foreign matter ) people certain kind cancer . It believe body 's immune system attack tumor cell kill . It think immune cell recognize special protein surface tumor signal fight cancer . One proteins call human chorionic gonadotropin-beta ( hCG-β ) find several type cancer include breast , colorectal , pancreatic , bladder ovarian . The study drug give injection skin ( intradermal intracutaneous injection ) . In addition , study include combination TLR agonists , thought stimulate immune response tumor cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Patients must read , understood , provide write informed consent HIPAA authorization nature study fully explain . 2 . Patients must 18 year age old . 3 . Patients incurable breast , colorectal , pancreatic , ovarian bladder cancer measurable evaluable disease . 4 . Patients never receive prior hCGβ therapy . 5 . Patients therapy potential survival benefit available , diseasespecific palliation goal therapy , must receive appropriate standard care therapy experience recurrence progression care . If therapy available , patient progressive disease may enrol . Patients refuse standard care option know provide potential survival benefit disease specific palliation eligible study . 6 . At least 4 week must elapse prior therapy first dose vaccine . Prior radiation therapy must complete least 4 week prior first vaccine dose . No prior radiopharmaceutical within 8 week prior first vaccine dose . The patient must recover clinically significant toxicity experience prior treatment ( ) . 7 . Patients follow medication may enrol study medication initiate 4 week longer prior screen dose change anticipate study . 1 . Hormonal therapy include gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRh ) agonist , antiandrogens , selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) , aromatase inhibitor , progestin . 2 . Bisphosphonates . 8 . Patients must ECOG Status 0 1 . 9 . Patients must life expectancy ≥ 16 week . 10 . Male patient sexually active must agree practice effective form barrier contraception course study . 11 . Screening laboratory value must meet following criterion : Neutrophils ≥1.5 x109/L Platelets &gt; 100 x109/L Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL Creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL AST &lt; 2 X ULN Bilirubin &lt; 2 X ULN unless due Gilbert 's syndrome upper limit normal . Laboratory abnormality attribute liver involvement cancer outside normal range allow exceed follow limit : AST &lt; 4 X ULN Bilirubin &lt; 4 X ULN Exclusion Criteria 1 . Since treatment CDX1307 theoretically may cause permanent sterility , woman childbearing potential exclude ( woman participate study must postmenopausal [ absence menses least 1 year ] and/or surgically incapable bear child ) . 2 . Previous administration hCGβ vaccine therapy . 3 . Concurrent treatment immunosuppressive immunomodulatory agent . 4 . Positive test HIV , HBV HCV . 5 . Patients active systemic infection require antibiotic treatment fever 100°F within 72 hour prior enrollment . 6 . Generalized dermatologic condition ( allergic reaction , infection , edema , scar ) allow easy access study drug administration evaluation localize adverse event . 7 . Patients active central nervous system metastasis , unless previously treat asymptomatic 2 month progressive size number 2 month . 8 . History second malignancy , except adequately treat cured basal squamous cell skin cancer cancer patient diseasefree ≥ 5 year . 9 . History anaphylactic reaction follow exposure humanize human therapeutic monoclonal antibody , know hypersensitivity GMCSF , yeast derived product . 10 . Patients follow condition : myocardial infarction within 1 year screening , congestive heart failure ( unless LVEF ≥ 50 % determine MUGA within 30 day screen ) , uncontrolled hypertension ( ≥ 160 mm Hg/systolic ≥ 100 mm Hg/diastolic ) , symptomatic lifethreatening arrhythmia persistent medication screening , clinically evident chronic lung disease unless lung capacity ≥ 55 % FEV1 ≥ 60 % screening . 11 . Any underlying medical condition Principal Investigator 's opinion make administration study drug hazardous patient would obscure interpretation adverse event . 12 . Medical condition require use systemic corticosteroid ( must discontinue least 4 week prior enrollment . The use inhale corticosteroid acceptable ) .</criteria>
