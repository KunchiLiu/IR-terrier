	<brief_title>HIV-1 Viral Dynamics Subjects Initiating Raltegravir Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study closely examine viral dynamic HIV-1 RNA DNA treatment-experienced subject initiate raltegravir . The data derive study elucidate effect antiviral therapy viral decay help refine current viral dynamic model . In addition , result study generate hypothesis test regard mechanisms action integrase inhibitor therapy salvage regimen . Lastly , viral dynamic study unique cohort provide opportunity validate effectiveness method measure rate decrease viral RNA DNA pilot potential potent drug regimen .</detailed_description>
