	<detailed_description>A grow body evidence support importance intervention Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) lung disease infancy early childhood , order potentially delay prevent irreversible lung disease . Yet , aside antimicrobial therapy , CF community clinical trial evidence base guide pulmonary therapy child &lt; 6 year age . Hypertonic Saline ( HS ) attractive chronic maintenance therapy investigate young child address defective mucociliary clearance , early step cascade event lead CF lung disease expect abnormal prior onset airway infection inflammation . This study randomize , parallel group , control trial ass efficacy safety 7 % HS inhale twice daily 48 week among young child CF 4 &lt; 60 month age enrollment . The primary hypothesis , compare isotonic saline ( IS ) , HS decrease number protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbation 48 week treatment period . The result propose trial may first time provide evidence early initiation HS , , improve mucociliary clearance , may delay hind cycle infection inflammation responsible progressive airway damage CF lung disease .</detailed_description>
