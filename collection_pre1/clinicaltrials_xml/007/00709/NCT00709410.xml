	<detailed_description>The seventh cholera pandemic begin Indonesia 1961 spread quickly Asian country . In 1970 , etiologic agent , Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor , invade sub-Saharan Africa , whose resident experience cholera 100 year . Outbreaks rapidly occur disease become endemic several part continent . In 2006 , Africa report 234,349 cholera case WHO , account 99 % officially-notified global cholera ( 1 ) . Between 1995 2005 , 66 % cholera outbreak report ProMed come sub-Saharan Africa ( 2 ) . There grow evidence large increase burden cholera Africa . One African country severely repeatedly affect cholera Zanzibar . After first case cholera confirm country January 1978 , regular outbreak report ( 3 ) . These outbreak cause human suffering , socially disruptive , divert resource essential service . Cholera control Zanzibar focus mainly case management , water chlorination campaign , dissemination hygiene message . The Ministry Health Social Welfare ( MOHSW ) eager identify new effective tool , oral cholera vaccination , could implement Zanzibar . In 2002 , World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend potential use oral cholera vaccine endemic epidemic situation , deem necessary gain experience demonstration project ( 4 ) . Since , mass oral cholera vaccination conduct Beira , Mozambique ( 5 ) , Darfour , Sudan , Aceh , Indonesia demonstrate feasibility effectiveness vaccination actual public health condition . The oral cholera vaccine available market consist kill whole-cell V. cholerae O1 purify recombinant B-subunit cholera toxin ( WC/rBS ) administer buff solution two dos , least week apart . The vaccine internationally-licensed ( include Zanzibar ) use individual 2 year age old . This vaccine , predecessor ( BS-WC ) contain chemically extract rather recombinant cholera toxin B subunit , show safe protective several trial conduct cholera-endemic setting Asia South America ( 6-9 ) sub-Saharan African setting high prevalence HIV ( 5 ) . An incompletely answered question regard vaccine potential confer herd protection ( 10 ) . The level herd immunity would determine minimum vaccine coverage require produce widespread protection cholera community . A recent study compare cholera rate sit Asia Africa show burden cholera great young child ( 11 ) ; herd immunity would provide protection child young receive vaccine , well unvaccinated member community . Although recent re-analysis data large placebo-controlled field trial oral cholera vaccine Bangladesh 1980s show substantial herd protection vaccination ( 12,13 ) , may limitations applicability finding cholera endemic setting different living condition ( 14 ) . Mathematical model Bangladesh data find cholera transmission could control endemic area 50 % vaccine coverage . At level coverage , model predict would 89 % reduction cholera case among unvaccinated , 93 % reduction overall entire population . A modest coverage 30 % would result 76 % reduction cholera incidence population area cover ( 15 ) . If confirm actual field study , mathematical prediction major vaccine cost-effectiveness implication . We propose carry mass oral cholera vaccination population high risk cholera Zanzibar follow assessment direct indirect protection . The WHO award grant Bill Melinda Gates Foundation entitle : `` Pre-emptive use cholera vaccine vulnerable population risk '' , proposal fund . The 6 million US $ grant aim address issue regard potential utilization mechanism pre-emptive delivery vaccine prevent outbreak endemic region . An important component potential creation `` revolving '' stock vaccine financial sustainability maintain stockpile . The lesson learn project crucial inform decision potential wider use cholera vaccination Zanzibar cholera-endemic sub-Saharan African country . The lesson learn effectiveness study form part evidence possible establishment sustainable vaccine stockpile . The project would provide essential information vaccine coverage require control cholera endemic area additional data vaccine effectiveness different setting Africa .</detailed_description>
