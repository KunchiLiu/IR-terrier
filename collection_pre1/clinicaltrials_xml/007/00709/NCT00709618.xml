	<brief_summary>This open-label , single-arm , multi-center , Phase II study determine activity vinorelbine plus lapatinib either first- second-line set woman ErbB2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . Sixty subject enrol study . Subjects receive vinorelbine intravenously weekly 3 week , follow rest week 4-week cycle ) plus lapatinib daily . Subjects receive treatment disease progression withdrawal study . The primary objective study evaluate overall tumor response rate lapatinib combination vinorelbine . Secondary objective include progression-free survival , overall survival , duration response , time response time progression safety . Safety efficacy assessment perform 4 , 8 12 week interval , end treatment . Subject : Metastatic Breast Cancer , ErbB2 , First-line Second-line therapy , Lapatinib , Vinorelbine</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : 1 . Signed informed consent prior registration . 2 . Considered Investigator life expectancy ≥12 week . 3 . Subjects must histologically confirm invasive breast cancer Stage IV disease primary diagnosis relapse curativeintent surgery . • Where disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature lesion confirm cytology histology . 4 . Documented amplification ErbB2 3+ immunohistochemistry positive score ( &gt; 2.2 ) fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) use local laboratory result ( consider sufficient study verification central laboratory ) . NOTE : If IHC FISH result available , FISH result must use eligibility . 5 . Subjects must receive 1 prior chemotherapeutic regimen metastatic setting . 6 . All prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , surgery ( except minor surgical procedure ) must discontinue least 4 week prior first dose investigational product . Hormonal therapy must discontinue least 1 week prior first dose . 7 . Prior diagnosis cancer allow long subject free disease treatment prior malignancy 5 year . Subjects completely resect basal squamous cell skin cancer successfully treat cervical carcinoma situ allow 1 year longer since definitive surgery . 8 . Subjects must measurable disease , accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) guideline . 9 . Females age ≥18 year menopausal status : Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , woman function ovary current document tubal ligation hysterectomy , woman postmenopausal ) Childbearing potential ( i.e. , woman function ovary document impairment oviductal uterine function would cause sterility ) : This category include woman oligomenorrhea ( severe ) , woman perimenopausal , young woman begin menstruate . These subject must negative serum pregnancy test screen agree one following : Complete abstinence intercourse 2 week prior administration first dose study medication 28 day final dose study medication ; Consistent correct use one follow acceptable method birth control : male partner sterile prior female subject 's entry study sole sexual partner female subject ; intrauterine device document failure rate le 1 % per year ; oral contraceptive ( either combine progestogen ) contraindicate subject population per local practice . ; barrier method , include diaphragm condom spermicide . 10 . ECOG performance status ( PS ) 0 2 [ Oken , 1982 ] ( Appendix 1 ) . 11 . Subjects must normal organ marrow function define Table 1 . Table 1 Baseline Laboratory Values Adequate Organ Function System Laboratory Value Hematologic Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Platelets ≥100 × 10^9/L Hepatic Serum bilirubin ≤1.25 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) Aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase 3 × ULN without liver metastasis 5 × ULN document liver metastasis Renal Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL OR Calculated creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min 12 . Subjects must cardiac ejection fraction least 50 % ( measure echocardiogram [ ECHO ] multigated acquisition scan [ MUGA ] ) within institutional range normal . Subjects require cardiac medication ( e.g . positive inotropic agent afterload reducer ) abnormal ejection fraction ineligible . MUGA scan accept case ECHO perform inconclusive . The modality ass cardiac ejection fraction must use consistently throughout study . 13 . Radiotherapy prior initiation study medication allow limited area ( e.g. , palliative therapy ) , sole site disease . Subjects must complete radiation treatment recover acute radiation treatmentrelated toxicity ( e.g. , bone marrow suppression ) prior commencement combination treatment . 14 . Subjects stable central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases . Subjects stable CNS metastasis define follow : subject asymptomatic CNS metastases stable least 3 month confirm compute tomography ( CT ) /magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Subjects evidence leptomeningeal/parenchymal involvement eligible take steroid enzymeinducing anticonvulsant within 4 week commencement study . Treatment prophylactic anticonvulsant permit , unless list prohibited medication . 15 . Subject must free gastrointestinal disease impede swallow retain oral medication . 16 . Able swallow retain oral medication ( intact pill ) . 17 . Bisphosphonate therapy bone metastases allow ; however , treatment must initiate prior first dose study medication . Prophylactic use bisphosphonates subject without bone disease , except treatment osteoporosis , permit . 18 . Subjects whose disease estrogen receptor + and/or progesterone receptor + unknown status include study meet follow criterion : They symptomatic visceral disease require chemotherapy . The disease consider Investigator progress rapidly life threaten . Subjects receive endocrine therapy longer benefit therapy . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : 1 . Subjects take treatment medication provide list restricted medication substance drug information section lapatinib eligible study . This include human immunodeficiency viruspositive subject receive combination antiretroviral therapy possible pharmacokinetic interaction lapatinib . 2 . Prior therapy lapatinib . 3 . Prior therapy vinorelbine treatment breast cancer . 4 . More 1 line therapy treatment MBC . 5 . Concurrent anticancer concomitant radiotherapy treatment . 6 . History uncontrolled symptomatic angina ; history arrhythmia require medication ; clinically significant myocardial infarction &lt; 6 month study entry ; uncontrolled symptomatic congestive heart failure ; ejection fraction institutional normal limit ; cardiac condition , opinion treat physician , would make protocol unreasonably hazardous patient . 7 . Have current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) 8 . Use investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose investigational treatment , , concurrent treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial involve investigational agent . 9 . Known immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically related agent use study excipients . 10 . Known history uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 11 . Concurrent disease condition would make woman inappropriate study participation , serious medical disorder would interfere woman 's safety . 12 . Pregnant lactate female time study ( due potential teratogenic abortifacient effect lapatinib breastfeed ) . 13 . Subjects diseases affect gastrointestinal function result inability take oral medication , include ; malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . Women ulcerative colitis also exclude . 14 . Peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 great . 15 . Unresolved unstable , serious toxicity prior administration another investigational drug and/or prior cancer treatment . 16 . Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent .</criteria>
