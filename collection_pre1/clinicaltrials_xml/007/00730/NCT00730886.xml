	<brief_summary>The objective trial evaluate efficacy safety ExAblate 2000 system enhancement fertility woman non-hysteroscopically resectable uterine fibroid , diagnose unexplained infertility . Uterine fibroid fairly common woman child-bearing age . An evidence base review support remove fibroid distort uterine cavity increase pregnancy rate decrease rate miscarriage . Some fibroid remove hysteroscopically minimally invasive , low morbidity . However , removal fibroid within uterine wall require invasive surgical procedure ( e.g. , myomectomy ) , increase morbidity risk include , limited , infection , blood loss postoperative uterine adhesion . ExAblate approve FDA treatment uterine fibroid ; however , use patient seek pregnancy consider experimental . Accumulated evidence suggest significant complication procedure woman seek pregnancy exist fibroid therapy ; however , data base small number patient . This study evaluate fertility enhancement follow ExAblate treatment myomectomy , woman unexplained infertility non-hysteroscopically resectable uterine fibroid .</brief_summary>
