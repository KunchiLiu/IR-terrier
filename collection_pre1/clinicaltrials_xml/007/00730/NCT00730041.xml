	<brief_title>Palatal Implants Combination With Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) intermittent cessation breathe sleep due collapse pharyngeal airway . As report April 2004 Journal American Medical Association , estimate 59 million people United States suffer OSA symptom . OSA typically diagnose overnight sleep study ( polysomnogram PSG ) sleep laboratory portable monitoring system . The American Academy Sleep Medicine 's ( AASM ) recommend treatment patient OSA Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) , life-long therapy require subject wear nasal facial mask connect portable airflow generator sleep . CPAP therapy intend treat OSA prevent collapse upper airway sleep use positive pressure . Compliance CPAP therapy may problem fewer 50 % patient use CPAP consider `` regular '' user due variety factor claustrophobia , nasal stuffiness , social factor , inconvenience . The Pillar® Palatal Implant System currently commercially available United States , Europe , country treat habitual snoring mild moderate OSA . It minimally invasive , well-tolerated procedure reduce flexibility soft palate increase stiffness , reduces snore may limit palate 's ability collapse airway sleep contribute clinical episode OSA . The Pillar system consist delivery system implant . The delivery system comprise disposable handle needle assembly allow position placement implant within soft palate . The 18mm x 2mm implant cylindrical shape segment braid polyester filament intend permanent implantation soft palate . The needle delivery system insert soft palate , near hard palate junction . A slide thumb switch retract deploy implant . The first implant place midline two additional implant place , one side approximately 2mm midline implant , total three implant . An antiseptic rinse recommend pre-procedure appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic give pre post-procedurally . Local anesthesia use patient . Pain medication suggest manage discomfort immediate post-operative period . While Pillar procedure effective treatment mild moderate OSA , effect combination CPAP treatment never study . In study , treatment OSA use Pillar procedure combination standard CPAP treatment vs. sham procedure combination standard CPAP treatment investigate . All subject ask continue normal use CPAP treatment study . The study evaluate whether Pillar implant allow less therapeutic pressure use treat OSA le pressure translates increase usage .</detailed_description>
