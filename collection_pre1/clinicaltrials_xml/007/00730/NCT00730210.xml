	<brief_title>Treatment Hypoparathyroidism With Subcutaneous PTH ( 1-84 ) Injections : Effects Muscle Function Quality Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoparathyroidism one hormonal insufficiency state usually treat replace miss hormone . Currently , Standard therapy include treatment calcium 1alpha-hydroxylated form vitamin D ( e.g . calcitriol alphacalcidol ) order relieve symptom associate hypocalcaemia . However , recent study show calcium homeostasis well regulate PTH replacement therapy patient hypoparathyroidism . It seem PTH treatment safe even may posses advantage compare conventional treatment vitamin D. As renal calcium excretion decrease PTH therapy , risk renal calcification cause impaired renal function may reduce . In addition , hypoparathyroid patient treat PTH report less fatigue increase endurance response treatment . This may due either well regulate ( i.e . physiological ) calcium homeostasis PTH therapy , due direct effect PTH neuromuscular system . Therefore , study need effect PTH replacement patient hypoparathyroidism . Outcome measure : - Muscle- balance function : Effects treatment muscle strength balance function determine use dynamometer stadiometer ( Meititur Ltd , Finland ) . In addition , effect treatment muscle function assess muscle biopsy , electromyographic , echocardiography , biochemical measure ( muscle enzymes ) . - Quality life : Effect treatment index quality life assess use SF-36v2- WHO-Five Well-Being Index ( WHO-5 ) -survey . - Calcium homeostasis , bone metabolism , body composition . Effects treatment assess measurement calcitropic hormone , biochemical marker bone turnover , iliac crest biopsy . In addition , bone mineral density body composition measure .</detailed_description>
