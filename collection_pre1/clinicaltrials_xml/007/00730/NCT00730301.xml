	<brief_title>EUROPT Clinical Trial Study Efficacy One-Way Valve Implantation ( New Treatment Algorithm ) Patients With Heterogeneous Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emphysema progressive pulmonary disease characterize abnormal permanent enlargement air space distal terminal bronchiole accompany destruction pulmonary parenchyma . Treatment include inhaled bronchodilator therapy , rehabilitation and/or oxygen treatment . In addition , patient severe emphysema may benefit surgical lung volume reduction and/or lung transplantation . The rationale lung volume reduction surgery reduce lung size would restore elastic recoil lung improve chest wall diaphragm mechanic . It previously show particularly patient heterogeneous emphysema seem benefit surgical lung volume reduction . Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction ( BLVR ) recently introduce less invasive potential alternative surgical lung volume reduction . BLVR attempt achieve effect surgery , place bronchial prosthesis use fibreoptic bronchoscope selectively occlude airway supply affect hyperinflated region emphysematous lung , permit exhale gas escape . This attempt achieve segmental lobar volume reduction , simulate effect surgical LVR . Recent trial BLVR use endobronchial one-way valve demonstrate significant improvement lung function parameter , exercise capacity quality life patient end-stage emphysema . The treatment algorithm valve implantation achieve BLVR , however , vary considerably report well clinical functional response rate . Subset analysis study reveal particularly , exclusively , patient radiological sign lung volume reduction treat unilaterally show significant clinical improvement , whereas patient without sign lung volume reduction experience benefit . The present study investigate response BLVR base new treatment algorithm include lung function criterion compute tomography thorax .</detailed_description>
