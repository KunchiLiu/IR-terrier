	<brief_summary>Malaria pregnancy contribute substantially maternal anaemia low birth weight : effective malaria control pregnancy could avoid 10,000 maternal 200,000 infant death every year . Intermittent preventive treatment drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( IPTp-SP ) , administer least twice routine antenatal clinic , recommend World Health Organization area moderate high malaria transmission , include Sub-Saharan Africa . Studies carry Kenya Malawi 2004 show two dos IPTp-SP significantly reduce maternal anaemia , placental malaria parasitaemia low birth weight . However , country strategy introduce part national policy , coverage target population vary widely , estimate 33-93 % uptake one dose 24-68 % two dos , country reach goal 80 % pregnant woman receive least 2 dos IPTp . New approach design improve IPTp coverage therefore urgently need . This study therefore set 2002 , order evaluate additional effect target promotional campaign antenatal clinic utilization coverage uptake Intermittent preventive treatment sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine rural health district Burkina Faso ; investigate effectiveness intermittent preventive treatment sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine compare weekly chloroquine , order provide additional evidence Burkinabé Ministry Health impending policy change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Approaches Improve Coverage Compliance Antimalarial Treatment Pregnant Women Rural Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year , 50 million woman live malaria endemic region become pregnant , half sub-Saharan Africa . In area relatively stable transmission , acquire immunity Plasmodium falciparum limit infection prevents severe disease adult , woman first second pregnancy vulnerable subject , due high risk severe anaemia low birth weight ( LBW ) outcome , lead cause child mortality poor growth development . Malaria pregnancy adverse consequence prevent suppressive antimalarial treatment chemoprophylaxis . Weekly chloroquine ( CQ ) basis prevention many year , application become limited time , partly difficulty coverage compliance throughout pregnancy partly increase parasite resistance CQ endemic area . A new strategy prevention base insecticide-treated bed net ( ITNs ) use intermittent preventive treatment pregnancy ( IPTp ) thus formulate , IPTp base administration treatment dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( 1500/75 mg ; SP ) pregnant woman pre-defined interval regardless malaria infection . WHO elaborate new recommendation , base administration SP two three time schedule antenatal visit least one month apart second trimester onwards . Evidence efficacy IPTp SP prevent malaria infection improve birth weight report East Africa West Africa . However , IPTp strategy assume pregnant woman attend antenatal clinic ( ANC ) least twice pregnancy time SP administer direct observation . Unfortunately , appear soon late attendance ANC weak health service limit effectiveness strategy ; coverage two SP dos vary widely ( 24-68 % ) well behind goal 80 % propose Roll Back Malaria Partnership . New approaches increase IPTp coverage urgently need . This study , conceive 2002 carry 2004 2006 , therefore two different component : one side , investigate whether promote regular early antenatal attendance pregnant woman community base health education would increase coverage uptake IPTp ; side , investigated effectiveness IPTp-SP compare weekly CQ , order provide additional evidence Burkinabé Ministry Health impending policy change .</detailed_description>
