	<brief_title>Pharmacogenetic Determinants Of Treatment Response In Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pharmacogenetics discipline devote elucidate genetic determinant drug response . Particularly area drug metabolism , many gene exhibit genetic polymorphism ; , stable percentage population ( generally differ ethnic group ) deficient functional expression enzyme involve , deficiency typically inherit autosomal recessive trait . With currently know polymorphisms drug metabolism , percentage homozygous deficient individual range 0.3 % many 90 % population , depend enzyme ethnic group . Our prior study reveal multigenic pharmacogenetic model significantly predictive various drug response phenotype ( e.g. , drug resistance , drug clearance , drug toxicity , disease response ) child ALL . The large number candidate loci relatively small number patient illustrate fact large sample size require definitively establish polygenic model . The fact significant race/genotype interaction , prediction differ white vs black , highlight need adequate number patient within racial ethnic group allow differential analysis genotypic predictor adjust confound demographic factor pharmacogenetic study via stratified design analysis .</detailed_description>
