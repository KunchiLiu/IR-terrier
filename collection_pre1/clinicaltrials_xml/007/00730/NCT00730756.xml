Double barrier method spermicide plus mechanical barrier ( e.g. , spermicide plus male condom spermicide female diaphragm ) . Female subject enrol plan become pregnant time study participation . A urine pregnancy test perform screen visit ( Visit 1 ) , randomisation visit ( Visit 2 ) final visit ( Visit 6 Early Withdrawal ) . Clinical history : Diagnosis evidence air pollution trigger predominant irritant trigger rhinitis symptom include ALL follow : A two year clinical history irritant ( nonallergic ) rhinitis trigger predominantly air pollution exposure ( write verbal confirmation ) opinion investigator evidence symptom rhinorrhea , nasal congestion postnasal drip relate concentration air particulate , air quality level exposure . Based trigger questionnaire , subject must indicate air pollution predominant trigger make rhinitis symptom worse complete Visit 1 . Negative skin test ( prick method ) response seasonal allergen ( include tree , grass weed pollen ) perennial allergen ( include animal dander , house dust mite , cockroach mould ) relevant geographical area complete Visit 1 . A negative response allergen skin prick test define wheal &lt; 3 mm diluent control . Positive response histamine skin test ( prick method ) complete Visit 1 . A positive response histamine skin prick test define wheal ≥3 mm large diluent control . Normal sinus radiograph ( Waters view ) rule sinusitis ( presence mucosal thicken ≥6 mm point maximal thicken air fluid level opacification ) . The sinus radiograph schedule Visit 1 . Ability comply study procedure : Subject understands willing , able likely comply study procedure restriction . Literate : Subject must able read , comprehend , record information English native language .

A subject must complete 80 % assessment screen symptom diary card . Significant concomitant medical condition , define limited : historical current evidence clinically significant uncontrolled disease body system ( e.g. , tuberculosis , psychological disorder , eczema ) . Significant defined disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk study participation would confound interpretation study result disease/condition exacerbate study . severe physical obstruction nose ( e.g. , deviated septum nasal polyp ) nasal septal perforation could affect deposition double blind intranasal study drug nasal ( e.g. , nasal septum ) ocular injury/surgery last 3 month asthma , exception mild intermittent asthma [ Global Initiative Asthma ( GINA ) , 2006 ] . NOTE : Subjects allow use shortacting inhaled beta2 agonists ONLY need basis . rhinitis medicamentosa bacterial viral infection ( e.g. , common cold ) upper respiratory tract within two week Visit 1 screening period document evidence acute significant chronic sinusitis , determine sinus radiograph ( Waters view ) do Visit 1 current history glaucoma and/or current cataract ocular herpes simplex physical impairment would affect subject 's ability participate study clinical evidence Candida infection nose oropharynx history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation , substance abuse ( include drug alcohol ) condition limit validity inform consent would confound interpretation study result history current use cocaine history adrenal insufficiency Chickenpox measles within 3 week Visit 1 . A subject eligible he/she currently chickenpox measles , expose chickenpox measles last 3 week nonimmune . If subject develop chickenpox measles study , he/she withdrawn study . If nonimmune subject expose chickenpox measles study , his/her continuation study discretion investigator , take consideration likelihood develop active disease . Use corticosteroid , define : Intranasal corticosteroid within 4 week prior Visit 1 .

Astelin ) within 2 week prior Visit 1 Oral intranasal decongestant within 3 day prior Visit 1 Intranasal , oral , inhaled anticholinergic within 3 day prior Visit 1 Oral antileukotrienes within 3 day prior Visit 1 Subcutaneous omalizumab ( Xolair ) within 5 month Visit 1 Use medication significantly inhibit cytochrome P450 subfamily enzyme CYP3A4 , include ritonavir ketoconazole . Ocular antihistamine , artificial tear , eyewashes/nasal irrigation solution , homeopathic preparation , lubricant , sympathomimetic vasoconstrictor preparation screen treatment period . No exclusion period prior screen ( Visit 1 ) require treatment . Throat treatment ( e.g. , cough lozenge , throat spray ) screen treatment period . No exclusion period prior screen ( Visit 1 ) require treatment . Use medication may affect irritant rhinitis symptom Chronic use concomitant medication , tricyclic antidepressant , would affect assessment effectiveness study drug . Chronic use longacting betaagonists ( e.g. , salmeterol ) . Chronic use intranasally administer medication ( e.g. , calcitoninsalmon ) . Use face mask ( e.g , general face mask use protection air pollution , CPAP face mask pillow ) , saline nasal spray lavages , eye drop , local , herbal homeopathic treatment .
