	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Humira Treatment Pyoderma Gangrenosum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pyoderma gangrenosum ( PG ) uncommon dermatosis consist nodule pustule ulcerate . PG occur anywhere body . Lesions often progress size may multiple . There universally accept treatment PG . In mild disease , therapy consist local wound care topical intralesional corticosteroid . For severe disease , systemic agent necessary . Systemic corticosteroid often effective , large dos require lead serious long-term side effect . Other immunosuppressive report successful individual case report small case series . However , associate significant toxicity . Infliximab antibody direct TNF-α . It use success treatment PG . Adalimumab ( Humira ) fully human antibody direct TNF-α . Given adalimumab target infliximab , one would expect adalimumab may also effective treatment PG . Treatment adalimumab may advantageous infliximab give home , whereas infliximab deliver intravenously office . Additionally , adalimumab fully human , patient would less likely form antibody medication . Purpose study determine safety efficacy Humira treatment pyoderma gangrenosum .</detailed_description>
