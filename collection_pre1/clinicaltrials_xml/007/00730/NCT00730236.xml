	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study AEGR-733 Treat Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia ( FH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) serious life-threatening genetic disease . Total plasma cholesterol level generally 500 mg/dl markedly premature cardiovascular disease major consequence . Untreated , patient develop atherosclerosis age 20 generally survive past age 30 . The primary goal therapy involve reduce cholesterol ( specifically , LDL cholesterol ) prevent coronary artery disease . Unfortunately , patient homozygous FH minimally responsive unresponsive available drug therapy thus limited treatment option . The current standard care LDL apheresis , physical method remove plasma LDL cholesterol transiently reduce cholesterol 50 % . However , rapid re-accumulation LDL cholesterol plasma , therefore apheresis repeat frequently ( every 1-2 week ) require 2 separate site IV access . Although anecdotally procedure may delay onset atherosclerosis , laborious , expensive , readily available . Furthermore , although procedure generally well tolerate , fact need frequent repetition IV access challenge many young patient . Therefore , tremendous unmet medical need new medical therapy orphan disease . AEGR-733 novel oral therapeutic agent hypercholesterolemia . Its mechanism involve inhibition microsomal triglyceride transfer protein , result reduction LDL cholesterol . Earlier study patient homozygous FH reveal AEGR-733 highly effective lower LDL cholesterol , yet long term safety efficacy need establish .</detailed_description>
