This study propose use sleep-directed hypnotherapy address sleep issue complementary element empirically support Cognitive Processing Therapy ( CPT ) treat PTSD sexual physical assault survivor . Specifically study aim : 1 ) compare result sleep-directed hypnosis plus CPT CPT , 2 ) ass relationship sleep PTSD symptom , 3 ) examine relationship sleep improvement , PTSD symptom improvement , therapeutic element ( hypnosis , exposure , cognitive therapy ) determine mechanisms action intervention , 4 ) ass relationship sleep physical reactivity trauma-related cue stimulus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep-directed Hypnosis As A Complement To Cognitive Processing Therapy ( CPT ) In Treating Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive Processing Therapy ( CPT ) demonstrate significant empirical support treat victim sexual assault suffer Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) throughout program research University Missouri - St. Louis . Similarly large treatment outcome literature , clinical trial reveal portion participant whose sleep remain refractory treatment even conclusion full course treatment . In fact , specific cause sleep disturbance posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) sufferer , prominent insomnia nightmare , determine . However , sleep impairment often report 17 PTSD symptom consider one refractory treatment . It theorize PTSD sleep impairment relate hypervigilance inherent PTSD sleep disrupt perception vigilance ( response perceive threat ) must maintain night . Sleep impairment see PTSD sufferer may result increased physiological arousal associate chronic hypervigilance . Hypnosis provide deep relaxation hypothesize decrease overall hyperarousal . Nightmares trauma cue disrupt sleep learning conditioning . PTSD sufferer may learn associate nighttime cue danger condition emotional response cue may disrupt sleep . Detecting relatively innocuous environmental stimulus ( i.e . normal nighttime noise ) try fall asleep interpret dangerous increase arousal . Hyperarousal interfere sleep identify causal development non-PTSD insomnia . Beyond decrease general hyperarousal , additive benefit hypnotic trance use post-hypnotic suggestion would facilitation new learn bedroom stimulus could become associated pleasant , restful image . The use hypnosis complement CPT , empirically support , cognitive-behavioral intervention develop treat PTSD , could specifically remediate 1 . ) sleep onset maintenance deficit , 2 ) frequency intensity parasomnia episode , 3 . ) cumulative sleep deprivation . Acquisition skill self-hypnosis provide PTSD sufferer tool regain normal restorative sleep pattern . Restoring sleep enhance efficacy CPT remediate psychiatric symptom ( PTSD major depression ) , reduce overall physiological reactivity , increase psychosocial functioning , decrease somatization . This study propose use sleep-directed hypnotherapy complementary element empirically support CPT treat PTSD sexual physical assault survivor . Specifically : Aim 1 : Compare result sleep-directed hypnosis + CPT ( hypCPT ) versus CPT-only ( CPT ) within sample female sexual/physical assault survivor . It hypothesize hypCPT group show significantly great improvement overall PTSD severity , concurrent psychopathology , overall sleep impairment . Aim 2 : Assess relationship sleep PTSD sxs . Specifically , identify temporal directional relationship elevation PTSD symptom increase sleep impairment accounting daily life stressor . Aim 3 : Evaluate improvement respect process therapy . Specifically , examine relationship sleep improvement , PTSD symptom improvement , therapeutic element ( hypnosis , exposure , cognitive therapy ) determine mechanisms action intervention . It specifically hypothesize improvement sleep positively temporally related improvement PTSD symptomatology throughout treatment . Further , overall decrease sleep impairment indicate temporal , positive relationship overall improvement psychosocial function health-related concern . Aim 4 : Assess relationship sleep psychophysiological reactivity trauma-related cue auditory startle probe . It hypothesize impairment sleep onset maintenance , frequency/intensity parasomnia episode , overall sleep deprivation positively related elevation psychophysiological reactivity ( heart-rate , skin conductance , facial EMG ) scripted-imagery paradigm auditory startle paradigm . It hypothesize decrease sleep impairment positively related decrease physiological reactivity across hypCPT treatment .</detailed_description>
