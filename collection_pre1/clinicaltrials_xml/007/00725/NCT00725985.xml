	<brief_summary>A randomized , double-blind , clinical trial ass safety efficacy two dose oral cladribine versus placebo subject first clinical demyelinate event ( clinically isolate syndrome ) . Subjects either cladribine placebo group may also enter treatment period open-label interferon-beta open-label cladribine depend upon disease status . The primary objective study evaluate effect two dosage regimens oral cladribine versus placebo time conversion multiple sclerosis ( MS ) ( randomization ) accord Poser criterion subject first clinical demyelinate event high risk convert MS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , double blind , three-arm , placebo-controlled , multi-center trial evaluate safety efficacy oral cladribine versus placebo treatment subject sustain first clinical demyelinate event within 75 day prior Screening . Subjects must minimum 2 clinically silent lesion Screening magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The study include pre-study evaluation period ( Screening period : 10 28 day prior start treatment blind study medication ( oral cladribine placebo ) . Depending upon clinical course MS , subject proceed ITP either Maintenance Treatment Period ( open-label interferon-beta treatment ) LTFU period ( either open-label low-dose cladribine additional treatment ( progression MS note initial treatment period ) . The single primary endpoint overall study , determine ITP , time conversion MS ( randomization ) , accord Poser criterion . For every subject , eligibility study enrollment entry study period , diagnosis conversion either McDonald MS CDMS must confirm approve Sponsor appoint study Adjudication Committee .</detailed_description>
