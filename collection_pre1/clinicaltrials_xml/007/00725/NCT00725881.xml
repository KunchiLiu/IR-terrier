	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety pharmacokinetics multiple , once-daily , intravenous dos trans sodium crocetinate ( TSC ) . The effectiveness TSC alleviating symptom intermittent claudication ( IC ) also assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Efficacy , Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Study Trans Sodium Crocetinate ( TSC ) Patients With Intermittent Claudication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral Artery Disease ( PAD ) manifestation systemic atherosclerosis , patient PAD commonly manifest symptom intermittent claudication ( IC ) cramping , ache , fatigue calf muscle provoke activity . In PAD , arterial occlusion lead decrease leg blood flow exercise walk pain associate ischemia IC . The diffusion oxygen blood muscle could component overall decreased delivery deficit oxygen ( hypoxia ) skeletal muscle result symptom PAD patient . The overall goal development TSC treatment PAD allow enhance diffusion oxygen plasma alleviate symptom cause hypoxia tissue . This double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial randomize 48 patient 8 clinical research sit US . In addition safety pharmacokinetic assessment conduct trial , primary endpoint study demonstrate standardized , grade exercise treadmill test conduct throughout study . The clearly measurable parameter peak walking time ( PWT ) claudication onset time ( COT ) compare baseline TSC placebo well-established endpoint accept medical community regulatory authority IC clinical trial .</detailed_description>
