	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( study body process drug ) , initial activity GS-9450 preventing liver damage due scarring , fibrosis , cause Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics , Activity GS-9450 Subjects With Chronic HCV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 32 subject receive GS 9450 placebo 14 consecutive day . Eight subject receive treatment within four dose cohort ; 6 randomize receive GS 9450 two randomize placebo : Cohort 1 : GS 9450 10 mg placebo give daily x 14 day Cohort 2 : GS 9450 40 mg placebo give daily x 14 day Cohort 3 : GS 9450 80 mg placebo give daily x 14 day If characterization activity profile deem necessary , additional cohort lower dose ( 5 mg ) may enrol : Cohort 4 : GS 9450 5 mg placebo give daily x 14 day Each cohort conduct sequentially . Advancement high dose cohort dependent upon satisfactory safety tolerability profile precede cohort determine Sponsor review ( conduct consultation Lead Investigator [ ] ) . Progression Cohort 4 ( 5 mg dose strength ) require safety review Cohort 3 ( 80 mg dose strength ) ; screen randomization Cohort 4 may begin immediately fully enrol Cohort 3 . Alternatively , dose-response relationship apparent review blind activity data first three cohort , final 5 mg cohort may omit .</detailed_description>
