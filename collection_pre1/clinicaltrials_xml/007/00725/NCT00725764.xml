	<brief_summary>This study conduct determine best confirm response rate , safety , tolerability GSK1363089 treatment adult subject squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) . GSK1363089 new chemical entity inhibit multiple receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) growth-promoting angiogenic property . The primary target GSK1363089 HGF vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) RTK family ( eg , MET , VEGFR2/kinase insert domain receptor [ KDR ] ) . Since MET overexpression associate poor prognosis MET tyrosine kinase mutation report SCCHN , inhibition MET receptor VEGFR2/KDR activation agent GSK1363089 may therapeutic benefit patient population .</brief_summary>
