	<detailed_description>In study , patient receive maximum 24 dos WT1 ASCI accord four cycle period four year . This protocol summary update accord Protocol Amendment 6 ( date 10 Sept 2014 ) . There longer active follow-up patient discontinuation completion treatment . The study end 30 day last dose administer , patient expose unnecessary study relate procedures.. In addition , biological sample collect protocol research purpose . For biological sample already collect scope study test yet , test perform default , except scientific rationale remain relevant .

	<criteria>The patient cytologically proven AML , define WHO classification . The pretreatment AML karyotype document . The leukemia could de novo secondary AML . The patient receive induction consolidation therapy accord Institution 's standard care . The patient 's blast cell show expression WT1 transcript , detect quantitative RTPCR . The patient complete remission ( i.e . CR1 , CR2 , … ) : Written inform consent obtain prior performance protocolspecific procedure . The patient &gt; = 18 year age time signature inform consent form . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 , 1 2 . Adequate hepatic renal function define : Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) . Serum alanine aminotransferase &lt; 2.5 time ULN . Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min . If patient female , must nonchildbearing potential , i.e . current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopausal , childbearing potential , must practice adequate contraception 30 day prior treatment administration , negative pregnancy test continue precaution two month completion treatment administration series . In view investigator , patient comply requirement protocol . The patient morphologic leukemiafree state morphologic complete remission incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) . The patient acute promyelocytic leukemia ( 15 ; 17 ) ( q22 ; q12 ) , ( PML/RARα ) variant . The patient receive , receive induction chemotherapy follow Stem Cell Transplantation . The patient ( ) previous concomitant malignancy , except effectively treat malignancy consider investigator highly likely cure . The patient hypercalcemia . The patient know HIVpositive . The patient symptomatic autoimmune disease , limited multiple sclerosis , lupus , inflammatory bowel disease . The patient history allergic reaction likely exacerbate component study investigational product . The patient concurrent severe medical problem , unrelated malignancy , would significantly limit full compliance study expose patient unacceptable risk . The patient history congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease previous myocardial infarction . The patient psychiatric addictive disorder may compromise his/her ability give inform consent , comply study procedure . The patient receive investigational nonregistered medicinal product study medication within 30 day precede first dose study medication plan receive drug study period . The patient require concomitant treatment systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent . The use prednisone , equivalent , &lt; 0.5 mg/kg/day ( absolute maximum 40 mg/day ) , inhaled corticosteroid topical steroid permit . The patient receive intravenous administration antibiotic within 2 week prior first study treatment oral antibiotic within 1 week prior first study treatment .
