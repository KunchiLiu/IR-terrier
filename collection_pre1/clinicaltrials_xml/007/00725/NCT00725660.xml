	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Pre-eclampsia complicates 2 % pregnancy . It account least 50 000 maternal death per year worldwide second common cause maternal death develop world . Also , Pre-eclampsia commonest cause iatrogenic prematurity , It frequently coexist intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) placental abruption , important cause adverse prenatal outcome . There many study investigate whether disease prevent . In order achieve , one need able identify firstly woman high risk disease . Early study show impedance flow uterine artery decrease gestation normal pregnancy , pregnancy establish pre-eclampsia IUGR impedance increase . These observation lead number screen study second trimester , assess possible predict pregnancy destine complication impaired placentation . These study show woman increase impedance uterine artery blood flow increase risk develop pre-eclampsia , detection increase use angiogenic factor ( That involve pathogenesis Pre- eclampsia could useful early prediction disease : VEGF , PIGF , PP13 , sFLT1 ) combination uterine artery Doppler study second trimester . METHODS : In study would like add uterine artery Doppler early routine detail ultrasound examination ( 14-16 week ) , 3000 woman Jerusalem . addition would like check angiogenic factor serum blood take routine triple test woman ( 16-18 week ) .pregnancy outcome would collect labour medical center participate research .</brief_summary>
