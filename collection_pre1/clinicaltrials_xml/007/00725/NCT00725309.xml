	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) lung disease primarily cause cigarette smoking . The breakdown elastin , protein find lung , cause lung damage may contribute development COPD . Some people may prone elastin damage turn develop COPD others . This study examine whether genetic factor responsible alter elastin function increase risk develop COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Genetic Factors That May Contribute Elastin Function Development Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD disease lung airways damage partly obstruct , make difficult breathe . There cure disease , fourth lead cause death United States . Symptoms include cough , excess mucus production , shortness breath , wheeze , chest tightness . The common risk factor develop COPD cigarette smoking ; however , 15 % 20 % smoker diagnose COPD lifetime , suggest smoker prone develop COPD others . Elastin , protein find tissue surround lung airway alveolar wall lung , essential healthy lung function . As elastin break , lung damage occur , potentially leading COPD . It think people may genetically predispose elastin damage cigarette smoke , thus account select group smoker affect COPD . This study examine way elastin defect contribute development COPD . Researchers examine whether genetic variation play role alter elastin function influence health outcome people COPD . This study enroll people COPD cause emphysema . Participants complete one study visit include medical record history review blood collection ( saliva collection , blood draw unsuccessful ) . A portion blood store future genetic research . Participants also complete questionnaire collect information activity , health , quality life . Study researcher contact participant end study collect follow-up medical information .</detailed_description>
