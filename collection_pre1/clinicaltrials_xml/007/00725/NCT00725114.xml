	<brief_summary>Different pathophysiologic mechanism responsible development chronic pain disorder . Pain pathway trigger part ectopic discharge voltage-sensitive sodium channel , abundance peripheral central nervous system . Tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) selective blocker Na+ channel cause analgesia either decrease propagation action potential Na+ channel and/or block ectopic discharge associate chronic pain . TTX extract puffer fish ( fugu ) . Results animal pharmacology study reveal TTX potent analgesic standard analgesic agent aspirin , morphine meperidine . At present , management severe cancer pain generally include use opiate . This often result undesirable side effect , treatment type medication always effective . Because currently available pain-relieving therapy unsatisfactory many patient , need new therapeutic approach management moderate severe cancer pain . Recent study indicate intramuscular ( muscle ) subcutaneous ( skin ) injection tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) may reduce pain cancer patient respond standard therapy . The current propose study ( TEC-006 ) design 1 ) demonstrate double-blind , placebo-controlled trial subcutaneous 30 μg b.i.d . dose TTX 4 day effective reduce pain outcome improving quality life ; 2 ) characterize onset duration analgesia , 3 ) demonstrate TTX well tolerate patient inadequately control cancer-related pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Efficacy Study Subcutaneous Tetrodotoxin Moderate Severe Inadequately Controlled Cancer-related Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : Male female subject moderate severe pain ( related cancer cancer treatment ) inadequately control current therapy : Primary Objectives : - To compare efficacy subcutaneous tetrodotoxin treatment ( TTX ) placebo measure : - pain outcome ( pain intensity reduction use analgesic ) - improvement quality life ( physical emotional functioning ) - To compare safety subcutaneous tetrodotoxin placebo . Secondary Objectives : - To assess onset analgesic response subcutaneous tetrodotoxin . - To determine duration analgesic response associate subcutaneous tetrodotoxin treatment . Overall Study Design : This multicentre , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-design trial efficacy safety tetrodotoxin patient 18 year age stable inadequately control moderate severe pain associated cancer . Approximately 15 center across Canada , New Zealand Australia expect participate . Subcutaneous tetrodotoxin ( 30 µg b.i.d . ) placebo administer 127 patient per group four consecutive day . The study period least three week start screen end analgesic response . Patients screen study enter 4- 7-day baseline period within 28 day screen . Following baseline period , patient either admitted hospital see site 's outpatient facility daily basis . Patients randomize Day 1 receive study drug twice daily four consecutive day . After treatment period , patient see Days 5 , 8 , 15 safety efficacy evaluation , every two week pain return . Sample Size : A total 254 subject ( 127 per treatment arm ) enrol study . The first interim analysis plan adjust sample size 60 evaluable subject enrol , complete data available analysis . A second interim analysis plan 50 % subject ( 110 evaluable subject ) complete study data available analysis . Investigational Product 30 µg TTX ( tetrodotoxin injectable ) equivalent volume placebo , identical appearance , inject subcutaneously twice daily 4 day . Efficacy Variables : Efficacy assessment include global pain intensity , component-specific pain intensity , ATC breakthrough analgesic use , impact pain physical functioning ( general activity , walk ability , normal work ) , emotional functioning ( mood , relation people , enjoyment life ) , impression change , onset analgesic response , duration analgesic response , time peak analgesic response . Safety Variables : Safety assessment include adverse event reporting , vital sign , physical neurological examination , 12-lead electrocardiogram , clinical laboratory test . Data Analysis Method : Two co-primary endpoint analyze study follow : Co-primary # 1 ( composite endpoint ) : Proportion responder observe treatment arm composite endpoint satisfy follow three component : 1. ≥30 % decrease mean pain intensity decrease ≥50 % opioid use baseline 2. ≥30 % improvement QOL least one descriptor physical functioning 3. ≥30 % improvement QOL least one descriptor emotional function Co-primary # 2 ( Pain intensity endpoint ) : Proportion responder observe treatment arm reduction pain intensity satisfy follow : 1. ≥30 % decrease mean pain intensity decrease ≥50 % opioid use baseline Trends differences treatment individually tabulate : - impact pain physical functioning - impact pain emotional functioning Comparison proportion responder treatment group make use Mantel-Haenszel procedure . Safety assess analysis adverse event , abnormal laboratory result , abnormality detect 12-lead electrocardiogram .</detailed_description>
