	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Oral Medication Treatment Prevention Digital Ulcers Patients With Systemic Sclerosis ( Scleroderma ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ambrisentan endothelin blocker approve treatment pulmonary arterial hypertension . Patients systemic sclerosis damage blood vessel , result increased level endothelin bloodstream cause decrease blood flow digit . This result painful digital ulcer . We hope learn whether block action endothelin ambrisentan helpful treatment prevention digital ulcer patient systemic sclerosis . This therapy approve treatment systemic sclerosis , study help u learn whether ambrisentan safe effective treatment prevention digital ulcer patient systemic sclerosis .</detailed_description>
