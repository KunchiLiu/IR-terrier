	<brief_summary>People 65 year ag break ( metabolize ) drug differently young adult . It known happen elderly people absorb break drug differently . These difference may show elderly individual need low dos medication avoid possible toxicity . We interested study yor body absorbs break lamotrigine medication . This research may indicate dos lamotrigine lower people get old .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination Absorption Elimination Lamotrigine-XR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If agree study admit General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) approximately 24 hour two different day ( Part 1 Part2 ) . We need take portion lamotrigine medication special form needle arm ( intravenously ) . The special form drug drug normally take except stable label ( NON-radioactive , naturally occur atom ) compound trace small amount drug body . No commercial product lamotrigine intravenous use available poor solubility water . The intravenous formulation use study chemical , hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin , improve solubility lamotrigine water . This formulation similar intravenous formulation approve another drug , Sporanox® ( itraconazole ) approve FDA . We obtain approval form FDA intravenous lamotrigine product use research purpose show safe twenty young individual . We collect fourteen ( 14 ) blood sample small tube place vein arm collect urine period 24 hour . One blood sample draw day 3 day total blood collection seventeen ( 17 tube ( total approximately 170 mL 11.5 tablespoon ) . The sample take measure blood chemistry concentration lmaotrigine metabolite result medication take control disease ( epilepsy depression ) For second part study , switch regular lamotrigine ( Lamictal® ) daily morning dose extended-release formulation Lamictal-XR® ( total daily dose ) . You remain extended-release lamotrigine ( Lamictal-XR ) two week , re-admitted GCRC 24 hour Part 2 study . Study drug administration blood urine sample identical Part I . The extended-release formulation regular lamotrigine determine manufacturer preliminary study absorb ( bioequivalent0 . You need change total daily dose take lamotrigine daily extended-release product . Your blood level lamotrigine check insure achieve appropriate concentration new extended-release product . For study , give one-month supply free charge extended-release formulation . After study complete , would return take regular lamotrigine dosing . If FDA approve XR formulation end study , doctor may decide keep extended-release form drug . With consent , genetics sample , consist three ( 3 ) additional blood tube ( total approximately six teaspoonful ) also collect genetic analysis . The genetics sample identify subject number corresponds sample . We use sample determine genetic sequence DNA responsible encode protein responsible break transport medication like lamotrigine eliminate body . You choose participate main study without take part genetics portion study . If withdraw main study , genetics sample discarded rest sample . choose participate genetics portion study , store genetics sample indefinitely , however , test specific DNA sequence do unless contact receive permission .</detailed_description>
