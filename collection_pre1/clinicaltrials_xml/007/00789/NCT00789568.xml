	<brief_summary>Sapropterin dihydrochloride ( subsequently refer sapropterin ) ( Kuvan® ) approve FDA treatment hyperphenylalaninemia 2007 . Preclinical clinical study post-marketing surveillance demonstrate specific cardiovascular concern sapropterin ( Kuvan® ) . Nonetheless , nonantiarrhythmic drug may potential prolong QT interval , lead potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia , include torsades de pointes . As part post-marketing commitment , thorough QT/QTc study conduct accord ICH guideline .</brief_summary>

Has know hypersensitivity sapropterin excipients , moxifloxacin . Pregnant breastfeed Screening plan become pregnant ( self partner ) time study . Use investigational product investigational medical device within 30 day prior Screening , requirement investigational agent prior completion schedule study assessment . Concurrent disease condition would interfere study participation safety condition , view PI , place subject high risk poor treatment compliance complete study . History clinically significant cardiac condition , eg , myocardial ischemia ( include angina ) infarction , congestive heart failure , leave ventricular hypertrophy , cardiomyopathy . Screening , Checkin , Baseline ECG show follow : Sinus arrhythmia unacceptable rate variation judge Investigator . Excessive heart rate variation rest , Investigator 's opinion . PR interval &gt; 210 ms. QRS interval &gt; 110 ms. QRS and/or T wave Investigator judge unfavorable consistently accurate QT measurement ( eg , indistinct QRS onset , low amplitude T wave , invert terminally inverted T wave , merge T U wave , indistinct T offset , prominent Uwave affect QT measurement ) . Neuromuscular artifact readily eliminate . Documented history arrhythmia ( eg , ventricular arrhythmias atrial fibrillation ) . Clinically significant electrolyte disturbance Screening Checkin ( eg , hypo hyperkalemia hypocalcemia ) condition could lead electrolyte disturbance ( eg , eat disorder ) , Investigator 's opinion . History palpitation , seizure , unexplained syncopal episode , symptomatic arrhythmia . History additional risk factor torsade de pointes ( eg , history neardrowning survival due loss consciousness , family history long QT syndrome , family history unexplained early sudden death ) . Any condition , opinion Investigator , may compromise absorption , metabolism , elimination moxifloxacin . History cancer within last five year , exception adequately treat basal cell carcinoma . Known allergy intolerance compound test product closely related compound , member quinolone class antimicrobial agent .
