	<brief_title>Relative Bioavailability Iron Folic Acid New Test Supplement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The proposal address issue bioavailability supplement SuppleFem compare current standard supplement Materna pregnancy Canadian woman . In recognition difficulty Canadian woman face order meet iron ( 27 mg/day ) folic acid ( 600 µg/day ) requirement dietary source alone pregnancy , Health Canada currently recommend iron/folic acid supplement take woman pregnancy . However , issue relate adherence , many pregnant woman fulfill Health Canada recommendation . Adherence largely influence gastrointestinal side-effects associate use iron tablet pill , well nausea vomit common first trimester . It estimate approximately10 % woman discontinue use iron adverse effect others use less daily dose . Women suffer indigestion heart-burn ( gastro-esophageal acid reflux ) associate use iron supplement commonly discontinue use many find difficult swallow pill nauseate . The bioavailabilities iron folic acid supplement may area concern , primarily due high requirement pregnancy . Materna® contain large quantity calcium ( 250 mg ) , whereas Sprinkles contain none . A study Hallberg , et al . ( 1991 ) show add little 165 mg calcium meal reduce absorption iron 50-60 % wheat roll . In addition , study Koren , et al . ( 2004 ) show adjust dose , iron absorb one maternal iron supplement contain calcium statistically less compare one without calcium . A study Rossander-Hultén et al ( 1991 , cite Sandröm , 2001 ) find zinc potential inhibit iron absorption supplement zinc add food . The iron supplement contain 25mg zinc whereas SuppleFem contain 5.5mg . There report interaction folate nutrient . However , evidence folate bioavailability may influence amount ingest . While pregnancy increase demand folate , amount SuppleFem compliant current DRI guideline 600µg , whereas iron supplement contains 1000 µg . Currently , enough research indicate whether unmetabolized folic acid pose health risk . Rationale : A new natural health product , `` SuppleFem Sprinkles '' , design address issue adherence . Sprinkles single-dose sachet ( like small packet sugar ) contain micronutrient powder form ( iron ferric pyrophosphate , folic acid micronutrient ) , easily sprinkle onto food liquid prepare household . Any semi-solid food liquid fortify addition . Sprinkles meant add daily semi-solid food eat home ( eg : pureed fruit , orange juice oatmeal ) , mixed liquid . The efficacy Sprinkles prevent anemia pregnant woman previously demonstrate , however , past five year , seven community-based trial four different country examine efficacy Sprinkles infant young child develop country xii , xiv , , , , , Before adherence measure primary outcome , however , must show significant difference bioavailability ferric pyrophosphate SuppleFem® compare iron lead iron supplement thus show SuppleFem efficacious standard treatment . If new delivery system prove non-inferior lead iron tablet , adherence new natural health product examine later date . Trial Objectives : Primary objective- The primary objective study determine whether powdered formulation micronized ferric pyrophosphate SuppleFem® ( mixed liquid food ) bioavailable iron standard recommend pregnancy supplement . Secondary Objective- The secondary objective study compare relative bioavailability ( ratio AUCs serum folate 8 hour period ) folic acid follow single dose Materna® Sprinkles . Study Design &amp; Duration : The crossover design study allow subject act control . Since intervention give therapeutic dosage rather large pharmaceutical dose anticipate carryover effect next intervention . The washout period treatment one week . It anticipate study begin September 1 , 2005 would last period 6 9 week . Duration study subject 3 week . Patients enrol trial upon answer post advertisement . During initial encounter , prospective subject inform purpose trial , trial conduct , time commitment possible potential harm This information explain study coordinator inform consent obtain patient agreeable . Subjects fill baseline questionnaire detail supplement use well demographic information commence study . Prior supplement use impact relative bioavailability either supplement since crossover design ensure prior use impact treatment equally . Visit number one determine diurnal variation value serum iron well establish iron status . Individuals group randomly allocate either SuppleFem® Materna® select coloured poker chip bag assign equal probability subject fall either two treatment . Two color choose represent two intervention . The chip place opaque bag study coordinator subject ask commencement second visit ( first intervention ) withdraw chip bag part randomization process . The colour identify intervention group subject place . For visit number three , subject receive opposite treatment one take visit two . Subject blind possible due physical form intervention ; Materna large pill whereas Sprinkles granular powder . This study highly control subject closely observe ingesting supplement ensure entire precisely measure amount consume . Further , serum measurement objective nature influence subject .</detailed_description>
