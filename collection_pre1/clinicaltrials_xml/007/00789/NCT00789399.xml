	<brief_summary>This trial prospective , single-center Phase II randomize study demonstrate superior efficacy Fondaparinux Sodium subcutaneous injection patient undergo CABG surgery ( isolated redo isolate ) versus treatment placebo . All consecutive patient schedule CABG surgery meet general inclusion none exclusion criterion consider enrollment study . Consecutive patient randomize day admission prior CABG surgery one two group . One group randomize placebo second group receive 2.5 mg Fondaparinux Sodium injection . Both group receive routine mechanical prophylaxis determine treat physician . Group randomize receive Fondaparinux Sodium receive 2.5 mg SQ daily drug dose start 12 +/- 2 hour post-wound closure follow day morning ( discretion cardiothoracic surgeon ) . The second dose would administer 24 hour later dose day . The group randomize placebo receive subcutaneous equivolume isotonic saline time point describe . Patients randomize receive 2.5 mg dose Fondaparinux Sodium placebo subcutaneously total 3-9 day post CABG day 1 day surgery . The drug discontinue patient discharge day 9 . If patient stay 9 day inside hospital , duplex would obtain per protocol DVT prevention measure would institute per discretion treat physician . Patients assess daily hospitalize symptom adverse reaction undergo laboratory testing ( CBC , PT/INR , PTT UA ) specify protocol . Post-op day 3-9 ( later 2 day last preventive drug dose ) patient undergo protocol specific low limb venous duplex scan earlier symptomatic . Patients also contact ( phone/office visit ) follow-up 25-35 day post CABG ass sign symptom deep venous thrombosis thromboembolism potential complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Efficacy Preventive Dosing Fondaparinux Sodium Versus Placebo Prevention Venous Thromboembolism ( VTE ) Patients Undergoing Coronary Bypass Surgery Receiving Routine Mechanical Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Information Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) follow coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery formidable risk view various predispose factor include restriction activity , history myocardial infarction patient , presence multiple predispose baseline demographic characteristic risk factor include advanced age smoking . The reported incidence asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) use duplex ultrasound ( DUS ) significant varies 16 48 % , thrombi calf vein . ( 1,2,3 ) The incidence symptomatic VTE base chiefly retrospective data range 0.5 3.9 % VTE , 0.3 0.5 % DVT , 0.2 3.9 % PE , 0.06 0.7 % fatal PE . ( 2-10 ) The absolute number affect patient may significant since number procedure perform every year US alone huge . According American Heart Association 's Heart Disease Stroke Statistics - 2008 Update , 469,000 surgical revascularizations do US 2005 . The benefit thromboprophylaxis medically ill patient include congestive heart failure well demonstrate 60 % reduction VTE risk . ( 11 ) The patient undergo CABG similar risk profile hence evaluate pharmacokinetic thromboprophylacic strategy . In CABG patient , American College Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines ( 8th Edition ) , 2008 , ( 12 ) recommend routine prophylaxis low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) , low dose unfractionated heparin ( LDUH ) , optimally used bilateral graduate compression stocking ( GCS ) intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) . The guideline base moderate low quality evidence strength recommendation weak randomize controlled trial . Rationale In CABG patient , American College Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines ( 8th Edition ) , 2008 , ( 12 ) recommend routine prophylaxis LMWH , LDUH , optimally used bilateral GCS IPC . The guideline base moderate low quality evidence strength recommendation weak randomize controlled trial . Optimally used stocking may applicable many CABG patient saphenous vein harvest hence pharmacologic mean preferable . Fondaparinux pentasaccharide efficacy safety show equal well LMWH thus may prefer agent VTE prophylaxis . ( 13-18 ) OBJECTIVES The primary goal study demonstrate superiority Fondaparinux Sodium placebo prevention VTE Patients undergoing Coronary Bypass Graft Surgery ( CABG ) . Primary Efficacy Endpoint : • Cumulative incidence VTE ( define symptomatic asymptomatic deep-vein thrombosis , fatal non-fatal pulmonary embolism , ) day 11 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : • Primary efficacy end-point VTE day 35 Primary Safety Endpoints : • Major bleed event day 11 Secondary Safety Endpoints : - Cumulative major minor bleed event day 11 - Deaths , requirement transfusion adverse event day 35 STUDY DESIGN This trial phase II , prospective , single-center , assessor patient-blinded , placebo control , randomize study demonstrate superior thromboprophylactic efficacy Fondaparinux Sodium subcutaneous injection patient undergo CABG surgery versus placebo . OBJECTIVES The primary efficacy objective include assessment cumulative rate VTE ( define DVT fatal non-fatal pulmonary embolism ) 11 day post CABG . The primary safety objective include assessment frequency occurrence major bleed event post-operatively day 3-11 . Finally , secondary efficacy objective include cumulative VTE event assessment component VTE secondary safety objective include assessment frequency non-major bleeding event day 3-11 well cause death , need transfusion monitor adverse event till day 35 . The inclusion safety mainly descriptive purpose study power safety end point . The safety efficacy endpoint determine Fondaparinux Sodium 's ability placebo prevent VTE assess bleed risk study population . A randomized control need head head comparison Fondaparinux Sodium placebo plan . Approximate time complete study enrollment 2 year . This estimation base number subject need study rate CABG surgery perform institution .</detailed_description>
