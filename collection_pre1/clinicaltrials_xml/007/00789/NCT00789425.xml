	<brief_title>Investigating Effect Standardized Olive Extract Bone Turnover Markers Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apart estrogen deficiency , early postmenopausal period also characterise increase inflammatory oxidant status , contribute development osteoporosis/osteopenia . The link systemic inflammation osteoporosis establish recently find high circulate hsCRP level associate low bone mineral density healthy pre- postmenopausal woman . Furthermore , already know long time one important cytokine implicate pathogenesis various metabolic bone disease , include postmenopausal osteoporosis , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , produce osteoblast , monocytes T-cells . Olive oil principle fat source traditional Mediterranean diet , diet associate low incidence disease , include coronary heart disease osteoporosis . In addition main ingredient ( ie . oleic acid ) extra virgin olive oil also contain phenolic compound , oleuropein- ligstroside-aglycones derivative . They form olive enzymatic removal glucose polar parent compound oleuropein-glycoside . A Mediterranean diet rich olive oil supply 10 - 20 mg phenol per day . The main metabolic attribute oleuropein exert antioxidant anti-inflammatory activity lowering level proinflammatory cytokine like IL-1 , IL-6 TNF-alpha . By inhibit osteoclast activity , may result lower rate bone resorption , least part , protect osteoporosis development . Formulated capsule expect compliance tolerability improve compare liquid administration . The present study design investigate effect 250 mg standardize extract olive polyphenols per day bone loss postmenopausal woman decrease bone mass ( osteopenia ) .</detailed_description>
