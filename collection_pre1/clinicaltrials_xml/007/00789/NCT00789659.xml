	<brief_summary>It belief investigator current trend complication rate associate fixation pelvic ring injury acetabular fracture obese unacceptable . The overwhelming majority complication attribute problem surgical wind healing . The investigator feel cost effective easily perform intervention prospectively utilized specific at-risk orthopaedic trauma population order control potentially devastating complication , effort discover intervention may prove valuable . It hypothesis obese patient treat V.A.C . therapy standard closure trauma-related , operative orthopaedic incision fewer postoperative wound complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity show independent risk factor postoperative surgical infection variety obesity relate non-obesity related surgery . With risk increasingly obese society , complication rate significantly differ base patient ' relative obesity may become increasingly unacceptable . The purpose propose prospective study evaluate role vacuum assist closure ( VAC ) may play reduce complication rate . Negative pressure vacuum assist closure first introduce 1997 way control potentially treat chronic wound . Since time , indication explode include variety chronic acute wound heal problem . We anecdotally use VAC therapy ( V.A.C . ; KCI , San Antonio , Texas ) effort control postoperative drain nearly ubiquitous morbidly obese orthopaedic trauma patient . The V.A.C . dress applied acute postoperative wound maintain immediate postoperative period . Although novel approach use V.A.C. , use previously report orthopaedic literature case series . To knowledge , prospective study evaluate efficacy immediate placement V.A.C . dress postoperative wound infection rate set morbidly obese orthopaedic trauma patient . It hypothesis obese patient treat V.A.C . therapy standard closure trauma-related , operative orthopaedic incision fewer postoperative wound complication .</detailed_description>
