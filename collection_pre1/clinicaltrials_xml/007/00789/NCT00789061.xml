	<brief_summary>Disequilibrium acid base inner ear suggest important factor lead hear impairment associate SLC26A4 mutation . For acid-base homeostasis inner ear , gastric-type proton pump might demonstrate antagonistic effect pendrin , protein encode SLC26A4 . To investigate whether proton pump inhibitor might prevent treat acute fluctuate hearing loss relate SLC26A4 mutation , launch current double-blind randomized clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Applying Proton Pump Inhibitor Prevent Treat Acute Fluctuating Hearing Loss Patients With SLC26A4 Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hereditary hearing loss common inherited sensory defect , affect 1 per 1000 child . With advance molecular genetics , nature hereditary hearing loss start unraveled . A plethora deafness gene discover past year , among certain genetic mutation note extraordinarily popular hearing-impaired population . For example , mutation SLC26A4 gene document high prevalence variety ethnic background , include Caucasians , Japanese Han Chinese . The two specific clinical feature patient SLC26A4 mutation inner ear malformation fluctuate hearing loss . For decade , latter constitute treatment difficulty pediatric otologist , traditional regimen , steroid intracranial-pressure-lowering-medication , usually could achieve satisfactory predictable outcome . Nevertheless , basic research recent year begin shed light pathogenesis hearing loss SLC26A4 mutation , novel strategy could develop base crucial finding . For instance , disequilibrium acid base inner ear report important factor lead deafness SLC26A4 knock-out mouse . And acid-base homeostasis inner ear , proton pump find demonstrate antagonistic effect pendrin , protein encode SLC26A4 . Consequently , regimen modulate function proton pump , like proton pump inhibitor , might good choice prevent treat acute chronic hearing loss relate SLC26A4 mutation degenerative dysfunction . Corresponding postulation , clinically experience significant recovery hearing loss several patient SLC26A4 mutation suffer acute fluctuate hearing loss refractory traditional treatment . In case , acute hearing loss recur medication discontinue . Therefore , launch current clinical trial investigate efficacy proton pump inhibitor prevent treat acute hearing loss patient SLC26A4 mutation .</detailed_description>
