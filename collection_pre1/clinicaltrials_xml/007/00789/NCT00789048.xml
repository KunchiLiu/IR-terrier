	<brief_title>The Influence `` Operating Table Position Simulating Radiographs '' Acetabular Cup Angle During Primary Total Hip Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type research : A prospective study . Population : A power study calculate order define sample size . The result indicate follow sample size suffice : - Study group : 50 consecutive patient undergo primary total hip replacement procedure - Control group : 50 consecutive patient undergo primary total hip replacement procedure Inclusion criterion : 1 . Age &gt; 18 2 . Candidate primary total hip replacement 3 . Agrees participate study Exclusion criterion : 1 . Patient n't agree participate study Protocol : Patients include research group control group undergo `` Operating Table Position Simulating `` radiograph pelvis . The radiograph do follow manner : patient potisioned non-operated side way pelvis perpendicular table . The legs flexed 30 degree hip joint 30 degree knee . The plate grid place behind pelvis device notch ( use measure angle later ) . After total hip replacement patient undergo A-P radiograph hip joint lie back hip joint bend 30 degree overcome forward tilt pelvis . All radiograph perform presence orthopedic surgeon . The control group first group patient . Their radiograph store standalone file control access rather general PACS system . The file open study . The radiologist control file responsible stage . The study group next group patient . In group radiograph save general PACS system . The radiographs measurement lateral inclination pelvis , lie `` Operating Table Position '' show chief surgeon day surgery one day prior . Both chief surgeon know study end . At end study , comparison group ' acetabular cup angle do . The angle measure twice . The first measurement do senior orthopedic surgeon specialize joint replacement operation . The second one do senior radiologist specialize skeletal radiology . If difference 5 degree find two measurement , third measurement do third examiner .</detailed_description>
