Evidences hypercoagulability include abnormal expression phosphatidylserine red blood cell ( rbc ) surface consequent increase platelet activation thrombin generation .

	<detailed_description>Hypercoagulable state well recognize patient β-thalassemia . Evidences hypercoagulability include abnormal expression phosphatidylserine red blood cell ( rbc ) surface consequent increase platelet activation thrombin generation . In addition , reduction anticoagulant i.e . protein C S antithrombin ( AT ) demonstrate . However , coagulable state patient β-thalassemia following stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) characterized.Therefore , objective compare coagulation marker anticoagulant among β-thalassemics without SCT normal control ( NC ) .The subject classify 3 group ; β-thalassemia post SCT ( Thal-SCT ) , β-thalassemia treat regular transfusion ( Thal-RT ) NC . Blood sample test annexin V ( index abnormal expression phosphatidylserine rbc surface ) , marker activation coagulation system ( thrombin antithrombin complex ( TAT ) , prothrombin fragment ( F1+2 ) , D-dimer ) anticoagulant ( protein C S AT ) .</detailed_description>
