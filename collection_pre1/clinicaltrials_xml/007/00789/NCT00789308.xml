	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Low Molecular Weight Sulfated Dextran Islet Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type I diabetes , also know insulin-dependent diabetes , chronic disease pancreas produce insufficient insulin properly regulate blood sugar level . Hypoglycemia , low blood sugar , hyperglycemia , high blood sugar , lead significant complication people type 1 diabetes . Intensive insulin therapy show reduce risk chronic complication people achieve near normalization glycemia . However , therapy labor intensive , difficult implement , associate increased frequency severe hypoglycemia . Transplantation islets healthy pancreas successful restore normal blood sugar level lead initial insulin independence people type 1 diabetes . Rejection islets recipient 's immune system , however , make treatment ineffective . An immune response know instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction ( IBMIR ) result disruption islet integrity islet loss within hour transfusion . LMW-SD inhibits IBMIR prevent cascade trigger , combine pancreatic islet . The purpose study determine safety efficacy LMW-SD give islet transfusion post-transfusion along immunosuppressive therapy , include mycophenolate mofetil sirolimus , tacrolimus cyclosporine , thymoglobulin basiliximab , success islet transplantation people type 1 diabetes . This study last 1 year final islet transplant . Participants may receive 3 islet transplant participate study . Participants eligible study clinic visit every 6 month . Once preparation islet become available , participant randomly assign Arm 1 Arm 2 . Participants Arm 1 receive LMW-DS 5 hour infusion . Participants Arm 2 receive heparin time infusion . In addition , participant receive anticoagulation prophylaxis agent consist Klexzane速 ( Enoxaparinsodium ) Trombyl速 Albyl-E速 ( Acetylsalicylic acid ) . All participant also receive oral immunosuppression medication consist mycophenolate mofetil sirolimus tacrolimus cyclosporine throughout study . In addition , receive intravenous thymoglobulin day -2 , -1 , day 0 ( transplant ) , +1 , +2 first transplant intravenous basiliximab time transplant Day 4 second third transplant . Enbrel速 ( Etanercept ) give participant anti-inflammatory therapy . Islet infusion occur hospital give intravenously . Participants eligible receive second third islet infusion previous infusion fail continue meet eligibility criterion . After infusion , study visit occur Days 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 75 Months 6 12 . At visit , physical exam blood collection occur . At visit , urine collection also occur .</detailed_description>
