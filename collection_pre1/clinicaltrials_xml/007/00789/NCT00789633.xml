	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study Compare Efficacy Safety Masitinib Combination With Gemcitabine , Placebo Combination With Gemcitabine , Treatment Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human pancreatic cancer overexpresses number important tyrosine kinase ( TK ) growth factor receptor ligand , include expression PDGF PDGF receptor . Drugs selectively inhibit TKs likely benefit pancreatic cancer . Masitinib TK inhibitor , selectively effectively inhibit c-Kit ( mast cell growth factor receptor ) , PDGF receptor , FGF receptor lower extent FAK kinases . Pre-clinical clinical study show masitinib reverse resistance pancreatic tumor cell line gemcitabine . Based pre-clinical phase 2 clinical study , masitinib consider good candidate use combination gemcitabine treatment pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
