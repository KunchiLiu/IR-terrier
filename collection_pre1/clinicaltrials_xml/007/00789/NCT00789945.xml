	<detailed_description>Data : The Rationale Timing premeal insulin administration - In type 1 diabetes , little , , endogenous insulin available handle carbohydrate load rapidly enter circulation start meal . In non diabetic individual , complex array physiological event occur prior eating ( often call cephalic phase insulin secretion ) prepare pancreas immediate release preform insulin meal related increase blood glucose occurs . This rapid insulin secretion prepare tissue ( primarily muscle liver ) take glucose rapidly thereby prevent severe hyperglycemia postprandial state . Since significant absorption short acting insulin ( e.g . insulin lispro , aspart , glulisine ) subcutaneous tissue occur 15 minute follow injection ( 26 ) , delay often result postprandial hyperglycemia . If patient happen hypoglycemic prior meal , delay advantageous , he/she hyperglycemic , severe postprandial hyperglycemia may result . A rationale solution problem would time short act insulin injection base premeal blood glucose , aside one pilot study address strategy , clinical study publish support approach . Our grant application design correct deficiency provide scientific data support addition intensive insulin therapy . We study effect Timing fix dose rapid act insulin lispro ( Humalog™ ) twelve type 1 diabetic subject make hyperglycemic prior standardize diabetic meal ( 11 ) . In study , dose insulin 0.15U/kg ( ~10 unit ) remain constant represent typical dose utilized type 1 diabetic patient prior even meal . Each twelve diabetic volunteer participate four study arm ( 48 total study ) . The insulin lispro give follow time : 1 ) 30 minute prior meal time ( -30 minute ) , 2 ) 15 minute prior meal time ( -15 minute ) , 3 ) meal ( 0 minute ) , 4 ) 15 minute meal begin ( +15 minute ) . As show Figure 1 , normal postprandial glucose excursion observe insulin take 15 minute prior meal . No postprandial excursion observe insulin take 30 minute prior meal . This desirable outcome hyperglycemic individual . Of particular interest fact insulin lispro take right mealtime ( common pattern type 1 diabetic patient ) , significant postprandial hyperglycemia observe . Figure 2 provide integrate postprandial glucose excursion ( baseline ) entire 5½ hour study reflect data Figure 1 . This study strongly support injection insulin lispro least 15 minute prior meal premeal hyperglycemia present . To certain absorption insulin lispro different four study might account difference postprandial glucose excursion ; measure free insulin level four research study . As show Figure 3 , insulin excursion concentration superimpose study , difference insulin absorption occur four insulin administration protocol . This data strongly support concept time insulin injection prior meal major effect glucose kinetics follow meal . Utilization Timing Intensive Insulin Therapy regimen major beneficial effect suppress postprandial hyperglycemia reduce A1C . Study Design : The propose study double-blind , randomize control trial approximately eight month duration per patient . The volunteer screen randomize either Timing protocol ( continue Intensive Insulin Therapy regimen ) continue usual Intensive Insulin Therapy . All volunteer utilize Continuous Glucose Monitoring every month order provide data magnitude postprandial hyperglycemia incidence hypoglycemia . Insulin Timing Algorithm : Based preliminary data ( 24 ) , utilize follow algorithm time premeal insulin administration dose : 1 ) premeal blood glucose &gt; 250 mg/dl = take insulin 30 min meal , 2 ) premeal blood glucose 250 150 mg/dl = take insulin 15 minute start meal , 3 ) premeal blood glucose 150 75 mg/dl = take insulin start meal , 4 ) premeal blood glucose &lt; 75 = take insulin 15 min start meal . Participants remain current insulin determine time algorithm indeed effective . The advantage algorithm easy remember practical typical patient type 1 diabetes . It design keep glucose 100 mg/dl 150 mg/dl . It reduce postprandial glucose excursion need , i.e . premeal glucose abnormally high prevent hypoglycemia premeal glucose low . Statistical Assessment Power Analysis : Our pilot data data available literature ass effect time pre-prandial short act insulin dose . As detailed , pilot study short term include assessment change A1C . Since A1C primary endpoint propose study , estimate change A1C would occur change observe integrated postprandial excursion ( figure 1 ) . Assuming postprandial glucose excursion responsible 50 % A1C value ( normal concentration 5.5 % ) estimate type 1 diabetic patient ( 16,17 ) , variance mean change integrate glucose excursion use estimate change A1C would expect proposed study . From data , calculate improvement A1C 1 % ( difference A1C control Arm A intervention Arm B would require 16 subject per group provide power 90 % detect difference p &lt; 0.01 . In order control maximum drop rate 20 % , recruit randomize total 40 volunteer group ( total 80 subject ) . Data Analysis : The primary endpoint study difference A1C level experimental Arm A ( volunteer utilize Timing ) Group B ( volunteer utilize Timing ) . This comparison provide net effect Timing direct measure change postprandial hyperglycemia . In addition , several sub analysis do . This comparison control positive effect Continuous Glucose Monitoring may A1C . In addition , integrate area five hour postprandial glucose curve provide day Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data primary meal day ( state patient - usually supper ) . This data provide mechanism improvement A1C observe . Finally , indirect assessment change postprandial hyperglycemia , change 1 , 5-anhydroglucitol ( Glycomark™ ) measure every month . We utilize `` intention treat analysis '' analyze data obtain . Analysis data do use NCSS computer software ( 42 ) . Clinical Importance : If pilot study validate propose randomized clinical trial grant application , new parameter control postprandial glucose become available patient type 1 diabetes . To date , concept utilized healthcare provider one demonstrate Timing result reduction A1C . Our propose grant application design obtain data make use Timing integral part glucose control algorithm . Our result restrict type 1 diabetic patient utilize insulin lispro since short act insulin analog exhibit approximately absorption insulin profile ( 26 ) , Participants remain current insulin regimen . If hypothesis prove correct , i.e. , correct Timing premeal insulin bolus reduce A1C average 1 % type 1 diabetic individual A1Cs 7.0 % 9.0 % , accord data generate Diabetes Control Complications Trial , significant reduction microvascular macrovascular complication diabetes occur . In addition , successful completion study provide stimulus examine Timing premeal insulin group diabetic patient , include type 2 diabetic patient insulin therapy , pregnant woman gestational diabetes , child type 1 diabetes . Finally , day age continue increase health care cost , inclusion Timing add additional financial cost diabetic patient 's intensive insulin therapy regimen .</detailed_description>
