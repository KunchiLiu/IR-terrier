	<brief_summary>With advance flexible bronchoscopy , like metallic stent , electrocautery real time endobronchial ultrasound , complexity duration procedure increase . So , adequate sedation analgesia important patient bronchoscopist . Clinical-judged midazolam administration current standard . However , midazolam difficult titrate clinical observation reliable sedative index . Propofol titrate easily unique pharmacokinetics . Bispectral index ( BIS ) , real time monitor depth-of-sedation , apply general anesthesia . We design BIS-guided propofol sedation bronchoscopy . Through combination advantage propofol BIS , hope provide patient tolerable safety sedation bronchoscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bispectral Index-guided Sedation Flexible Bronchoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well known patient undergo bronchoscopy could less suffer procedure could carry smoothly patient adequate sedation analgesia . The preferred sedative analgesic drug Midazolam opioid , like Alfentanil Morphine , titrate accord physician ' judgment patient ' clinical responsiveness . However , due pharmacokinetic characteristic midazolam use intravenous injection ( onset time 4-6 minute , effective time 2-4 hour ) , effective onset time may slow repeat injection patient already suffer bronchoscopic procedure . It also note over-sedation occur side effect like apnea/hypopnea , hypoxemia , hypotension could last dozen minute hour . Although event mention could handle properly experience medical staff , still difficult predict oncoming event pharmacokinetic effect variant individually . Ideally , safe efficient , invasive procedure like bronchoscope , sedative drug could onset vanish fast drug effect could titrate objective device directly monitor depth sedation anesthesia . Propofol short-acting intravenous sedative agent use induction general anesthesia child adult ; maintenance general anesthesia ; sedation medical context , intensive care unit ( ICU ) sedation intubate , mechanically ventilated adult , procedure colonoscopy . Its mechanism action uncertain , postulated primary effect may potentiation Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid-A receptor , possibly slow channel closing time . It fast onset time ( 1~2 minute ) short work duration ( 8~10 minute ) , vanish fast stop administration . Bispectral Index ( BIS ) , non-invasive neurophysiologic monitor instrument , transform electroencephalogram ( EEG ) electromyography patient continual numeral , range 0 99 , provide direct real-time sedative depth monitor . A BIS value 0 equal EEG silence , near 100 expect value fully awake adult , below70 indicated patient lose explicit memory recall still ability maintain vital sign . In study , design sedative technique bronchoscopy , BIS-guided propofol administration , compare traditional sedative technique , clinical-judged midazolam administration . Through combination advantage unique pharmacokinetics propofol real time monitor sedative level BIS , hope provide patient undergo bronchoscopy satisfy safety sedative procedure .</detailed_description>
