	<brief_summary>This purpose study design compare two type image ; magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Trans-Rectal Ultrasound ( TRUS ) see one performs accurately image-guided insertion Fiducial Markers ( FMs ) within tumour . Though effective guide FM placement pole prostate gland due excellent visualization prostatic boundary , TRUS may ideally suit mark GTV . Conventional TRUS neither sufficiently sensitive specific accurate visualization intra-prostatic tumor . A new interventional MRI technique enable needle guidance gross tumour Volume ( GTV ) FM placement . It particular importance technique evaluate enable one effective implement design future trial involve dose-escalation prostate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fiducial Localization Individualized Radiotherapy -Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The success dose escalation strategy prostate cancer last decade rely high accuracy target delineation , localization radiation delivery . Improved biochemical control acceptable level toxicity ( specifically rectal ) achieve stringently monitor location prostate course radiation treatment . Studies early 1990 's demonstrate daily bony alignment poor surrogate prostate gland location . Since , various strategy devise localize prostate precisely treatment . Of , Transrectal Ultrasound ( TRUS ) -guided gold fiducial marker ( FM ) insertion x-ray imaging marker broadly successful approach . TRUS guidance use fiducial marker insertion within prostate since 1985 various center throughout world also standard practice PMH since 1997 men undergo radical external beam radiotherapy . A retrospective comparative study 106 patient evaluate relative accuracy endorectal MRI TRUS detect location tumor report improved performance endorectal MRI especially base midgland region . Over last year , mount experience interpretation prostate MRI , addition physiologic image sequence improve performance MRI detect localize GTV .</detailed_description>
