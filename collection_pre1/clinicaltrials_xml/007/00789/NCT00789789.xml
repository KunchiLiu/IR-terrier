	<detailed_description>Since 1992 , 16 phase I II clinical trial perform French National Agency Research AIDS Viral Hepatitis ( ANRS ) evaluate safety several HIV-1 vaccine candidate capacity induce immune response . The ANRS program evaluate recombinant HIV-1 envelope protein Rgp-160 , canarypox ALVAC vector , mixture lipopeptides whose sequence represent CTL-epitopes HIV-1 Gag , Pol Nef proteins . Most administered intramuscularly recently , mucosal immunization intradermal route use . Previously compile publish meta-analysis , safety study restrict duration trial . ANRS establish cohort study order describe long-term safety preventive HIV-vaccines administer phase I II clinical trial healthy volunteer `` ANRS volunteer-network '' France gather clinical biological data database blood specimen collection could analyse case long-term safety issue ANRS vaccine trial pertinent , HIV vaccine trial ANRS COV1-COHVAC prospective , multicentric cohort study compose participant preventive HIV-vaccines phase I II trial . All ANRS volunteer ever receive one dose candidate vaccine eligible go complete participation clinical trial cohort study time . The ANRS COV1-COHVAC project rely long-term follow-up cohort ( least 7 year end vaccine trial ) , include retrospective prospective collection medical biological data [ severe health event ( grade 3-4 ) , well neurological , ophtalmological , immunological event ( grade ) , start first injection candidate vaccine , record ] , blood specimen collection psycho-behavioral evaluation ( self-questionnaires interview ) order collect data consequence participation experience possible HIV vaccine-induced seropositivity trial . Of ANRS `` volunteer-network '' , 206 participant involve early trial actually eligible participate cohort . Altogether recent study complete progress , cohort comprise least 400 individual 2009 .</detailed_description>
