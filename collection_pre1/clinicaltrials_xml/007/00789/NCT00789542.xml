	<brief_summary>Strokes occur blood flow part brain interrupted . Patients often bedbound several day week although survive , make recovery . The lack mobility encourage blood clot form legs − call deep venous thrombosis DVT . About 10 % patient develop . Pieces clot may break carried bloodstream lung . These clot , call pulmonary embolus , stop heart cause patient stroke die suddenly . A treatment reduce risk DVT surgery intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) . Inflatable sleeve wrap around legs inflate interval squeeze blood leg , increase blood flow , decrease likelihood clot form − least theory ! . Although sound uncomfortable , people actually quite like sensation ! There small randomise trial IPC stroke patient , particularly intracerebral bleeding . However , study although encourage provide enough information persuade clinician use treatment routinely stroke unit . The propose study include 2000 patient stroke admitted stroke unit . Patients walk independently , great risk DVT invite join study . If agree randomly allocate routine care plus IPC routine care . Patient group routine ultrasound scan legs detect DVTs . The study establish whether IPC reduces risk DVT . This result could improve outcome many thousand patient year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A RCT Establish Effectiveness Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Prevent Post Stroke DVT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : Multicentre randomise control trial observer blind assessment primary outcome . Setting : Stroke unit UK . Identification eligible patient , consent , recruitment , delivery monitoring allocate treatment occur within unit . Screening compression doppler ultrasounds occur radiology department vascular laboratory mainly hospital admission although minority patient discharge hospital may test outpatient . Six month follow occur place residence via postal telephone questionnaire . Target population : Patients ( 16 year ) admit hospital acute stroke immobile therefore significant risk develop deep venous thrombosis . Health technology assess : The trial compare outcomes patient receive Routine care plus Intermittent Pneumatic Compression ( IPC ) v . Routine care avoid IPC . Patients allocate IPC fit thigh length IPC sleeves although well tolerate , instance heavy soiling due faecal incontinence , knee sleeve substitute . Ideally IPC worn day night 30 day randomisation OR second screen doppler ultrasound ( 30 day ) . Routine care likely include general measure reduce risk DVT include , adequate hydration , routine use aspirin patient ischaemic stroke early mobilisation . It may also include routine use graduate compression stocking ( GCS ) show effective ongoing CLOTS Trials 1 &amp; 2 . Participating centre ask ensure standard care specific institution apply equally rigorously patient trial irrespective treatment allocation . Collaborators permit use intervention feel clinically justified − monitor use antithrombotics GCS ensure balance two treatment arm . Measurement cost outcome : The primary outcome `` presence definite probable symptomatic asymptomatic DVT vein behind knee thigh detect either two screen compression Doppler ultrasound scan ( perform 7−10 day 25 − 30 day part research ) contrast venography MRI ( clinically indicate ) within 30 day randomisation '' . This regard clinically important outcome , acceptable patient staff show practical collect vast majority patient ongoing CLOTS Trials 1 &amp; 2 . Secondary outcome measure hospital collect hospital discharge review casenotes include : death within 30 day ; Presence definite probable DVT popliteal femoral vein detect screen Compression Doppler ultrasound scan suspect clinically scan , Definite ( i.e . exclude probable DVTs ) symptomatic asymptomatic DVT popliteal femoral vein detect either Compression Doppler ultrasound scan contrast venography MRI direct thrombus image within 30 day randomisation ; Any definite probable symptomatic asymptomatic DVT ( i.e . include DVTs involve calf vein ) ; Confirmed fatal non−fatal PE ; Adherence allocate treatment . Others secondary outcome measure either postal telephone questionnaire six month include : death cause , place residence , post discharge DVT , PE , post DVT syndrome , disability , health relate quality life . These supplement follow−up survival via GPs . Sample size : We plan recruit 2000 patient . The Trial &gt; 90 % power ( alpha 0.05 ) identify absolute reduction risk primary outcome 4 % ( 10 % 6 % ) . The frequency primary outcome estimate ongoing CLOTS Trials 1 &amp; 2 use entry criterion method follow . The estimated effect size ( odds reduction = 43 % ) base treatment effect systematic review previous stroke trial ( odds reduction = 48 % ) attenuate delay apply treatment due trial recruitment realistic estimate adherence allocate treatment . If event rate treatment group combine low expect Trial Steering Committee may decide increase recruitment target . We aim enrol least 1500 patient Days 0−2 stroke onset . This provide great 80 % power detect reduction proximal DVT 10 % 6 % patient enrol Days 0−2 . If proportion enrol Day 2 exceed 25 % total Trial Steering Committee consider raise overall target beyond 2000 ensure least 1500 recruit Days 0−2 . This help ensure miss real treatment effect delay recruitment . If trial show IPC effective reducing risk DVT stroke likely IPC treatment start earlier trial . Flow patient perspective 1 . Approach clinical staff give verbal write information trial 2 . Completion consent form 3 . Informed treatment allocation 4 . Start treatment − application intermittent pneumatic compression half patient . This involve nursing staff measure patient thigh diameter , fit correct size sleeve check patient legs three time per day ensure problem skin develop . 5 . At 7−10 day recruitment patient go X Ray department screen Doppler ultrasound leg . The IPC remove prior leave ward replace return . 6 . At 25−30 day recruitment patient go X Ray department second screen Doppler ultrasound leg . If already discharge hospital may involve outpatient appointment . Patient transport provide require . 7 . At 30 day IPC ( allocate ) finally remove unless remove earlier specific reason ( see protocol ) 8 . At 6 month recruitment patient receive short postal questionnaire find current functional status , whether clot since hospital discharge blood thin medication might take .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any patient admit hospital within 3 day clinical stroke fulfil WHO criterion . • Who able get chair/ bed walk toilet without help another person Patients randomise Day 0 ( day admission ) Day 3 hospital admission . If patient stroke hospital admission eligible Day 3 stroke onset ( Day 0 ) . Stroke likely clinical diagnosis visible infarction see brain scan . Patients stroke due subarachnoid haemorrhage . These exclude generally treat neurology/neurosurgical centre , rather stroke unit , care often include coil clip aneurysms general anaesthetic . One could therefore argue exist evidence support use IPC surgical patient adequate support routine use group patient . Patients , opinion responsible clinician / nurse , unlikely benefit Intermittent Pneumatic Compression instance judge low risk DVT . For instance , would include patient expected mobilise within next day . Patients anticoagulated ( take Warfarin , unfractionated heparin , Low Molecular Weight Heparin Direct thrombin inhibitor ) time enrolment plan continue anticoagulation throughout first week two stroke . These patient likely low risk post stroke DVT little potential benefit either IPC participation CLOTS 3 trial . However , patient may start anticoagulant first day reason prophylaxis VTE e.g . secondary prevention ischaemic stroke atrial fibrillation eligible enrolment . Patients contraindication use IPC . These include : patient local leg condition IPC sleeve would interfere dermatitis , vein ligation ( immediate postoperative ) , gangrene , venous stasis , recent skin graft . patient severe arteriosclerosis ischaemic vascular disease indicate absence pedal pulse history definite intermittent claudication . patient massive leg oedema pulmonary oedema congestive heart failure . Patients already swell sign exist DVT . Such patient may recruit DVT exclude normal D Dimers Compression Doppler ultrasound . Patients 16 year age Inclusion another research study , include another randomise control trial , automatically exclude patient participate CLOTS 3 . As long inclusion study would confound result CLOTS 3 , coenrolment permissible . Also , local researcher must avoid overburden patient . Patients coenrolled another research study aim test intervention aim reduce risk venous thromboembolism</criteria>
