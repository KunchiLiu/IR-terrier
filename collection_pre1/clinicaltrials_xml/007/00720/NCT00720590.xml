	<brief_summary>HIV protease inhibitor ( PIs ) class antiretroviral drug use inhibit viral replication . They interfere key step replication process . Some HIV PIs associate increase risk adverse cardiovascular side effect . Further study need , however , assess full extent effect new HIV PIs , include atazanavir lopinavir/ritonavir , cardiovascular disease risk . This study compare effect atazanavir , lopinavir/ritonavir , placebo certain cardiovascular disease risk factor healthy people without HIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect HIV Protease Inhibitors Atazanavir Lopinavir/Ritonavir Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral therapy HIV , particularly use PIs , associate increase risk heart attack . Specific cardiovascular side effect see use PIs include insulin resistance , abnormal blood lipid level , endothelial dysfunction ( abnormality cell line inner surface blood vessel ) . Past study show treatment indinavir , old PI , result significant endothelial dysfunction , may main cause increase cardiovascular risk . Indinavir seldom use clinical practice , new PIs atazanavir combination lopinavir/ritonavir account nearly 70 % total PI use United States . It known effect new PIs endothelial dysfunction . This study compare effect atazanavir , lopinavir/ritonavir , placebo certain cardiovascular disease risk factor , include abnormal glucose metabolism endothelial dysfunction , healthy people without HIV . Participation study last 4 week . All participant undergo initial assessment include various vascular metabolic evaluation . Body weight , height , basal heart rate , systolic diastolic blood pressure also measure . Participants assign randomly receive 4 week treatment 400 mg atazanavir per day plus placebo , 400 mg/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice per day plus placebo , placebo drug per day . Upon complete 4 week treatment , participant repeat initial assessment .</detailed_description>
