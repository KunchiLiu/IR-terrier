	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study lenalidomide effective drug prevent relapse MDS AML patient chromosomal abnormality involve monosomy 5 del5q allogeneic HSCT . Due immunomodulatory action might also able enhance T - NK cell mediate graft versus leukemia ( GVL ) effect . Nevertheless , one keep mind possible , yet unknown influence modulation clinical GVHD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytogenetics main predictor outcome patient MDS AML . In fact , monosomy 5 ( -5 ) del5q ( exclude typical 5q-syndrome ) mostly poor prognostic marker also frequently part complex karyotype . Together , patient often respond conventional chemotherapy cure allogeneic HSCT . Nevertheless , even transplantation relapse rate considerably high majority patient 's relapse occur within first year HSCT . Lenalidomide successfully use MDS patient del5q , irrespective additional cytogenetic abnormality . Furthermore , vitro study demonstrate also impressive anti-proliferative effect compound cell line harbour monosomy 5 . Therefore , seem promise compound prevent relapse high-risk MDS AML patient chromosomal abnormality involve del5q -5 allogeneic HSCT . Due immunomodulatory action might also able enhance T - NK cell mediate graft versus leukemia effect . Nevertheless , unknown whether lenalidomide could modulate enhance clinical graft versus host disease .</detailed_description>
