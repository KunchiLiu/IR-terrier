	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis : Low dose growth hormone ( GH ) , generation free 'bioavailable ' insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -I , improve insulin sensitivity metabolic profile subject metabolic syndrome . Study aim : The purpose study determine mechanism low dose GH treatment affect body 's sensitivity insulin action whether low GH dose affect body 's handle steroid hormone level ( cortisol clearance ) fat deposition subject metabolic syndrome . Study design : Subjects satisfy criterion metabolic syndrome ( central obesity , treat untreated high blood pressure , high cholesterol impair fast glucose level ) invite participate study . The subject assess initial visit ascertain suitability participation study . If eligible , equal number men woman randomize ( like flip coin ) receive either daily low dose GH placebo injection first 12 week , exchange another 12 week treatment 4-week washout period . Before , treatment , subject assess frequently blood test , scan fat biopsy . During study , subject study 4 time Oregon Clinical Translational Research Institute ( OCTRI ) . At first , second final visit , test include scan measure amount whole body fat fat stomach area , muscle , liver ; blood test measure level cortisol , fat tissue ( take biopsy ) analysis measure density insulin-like growth factor-I ( hormone stimulate growth hormone body ) fat ; whereas blood test examine well insulin work body ( insulin sensitivity ) collect visit study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study double-blinded randomize placebo-controlled cross-over study . Thirty subject screen eligibility initially , first 12 eligible subject enrol . Six subject randomize receive low GH dose ( 0.1 mg/day ) treatment 6 subject receive Placebo treatment 12 week , exchange treatment 12 week 4-week washout period . The study drug store Oregon Health Science University ( OHSU ) Research Pharmacy follow randomization , subject taught either Principal Investigator one Endocrine Nurses self-administer injection use Norditropin/Placebo vial insulin syrinx abdomen 2200h . Randomization treatment assignment perform investigator directly involved patient ' recruitment , treatment follow-up care . The randomization process perform computerized pre-assigned random code block , stratify age examine possible difference body mass index . During in-patient stay Oregon Clinical Translational Research Institute ( OCTRI ) OHSU , subject allow eat food provide OCTRI . Initial Screening Assessment ( outpatient ) The following assessment perform : - Written inform consent - Demographics ( demographic information include subject 's birth date , race ) - Physical exam medical history - Previous/significant medical history - Concomitant medication review - Vital sign , e.g. , pulse blood pressure measurement - Height , weight waist circumference - Laboratory finding , e.g . CBC , electrolytes , fast glucose level Visit 1 , Baseline Assessment First Treatment Phase ( in-patient ) The following description assessment perform consent obtain : - Physical exam medical history - Vital sign , e.g. , pulse blood pressure measurement - Height weight - Waist circumference measurement - Concomitant medication review - Urine pregnancy test female child-bearing subject - Fasting blood assessment , e.g. , hemoglobin , glucose , insulin , C-peptide , serum total free IGF-I , IGFBP-3 , C-reactive protein , non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFAs ) , adiponectin , ghrelin - A 3-hour one-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp - MRS DEXA scan - Cortisol clearance rate assessment - Fat biopsy - Randomization GH Placebo - Teach GH Placebo self-administration Visit 2 , Final Assessment First Treatment Phase ( Week 12 +/- 1 week ) ( outpatient ) The following description assessment perform end first treatment phase either GH Placebo . Subjects also monitor safety collection follow : - Physical exam medical history - Vital sign , e.g . pulse blood pressure measurement - Height weight - Waist circumference measurement - Concomitant medication review - Adverse event record - Urine pregnancy test female child-bearing subject - Fasting blood assessment , e.g. , hemoglobin , glucose , insulin , C-peptide , serum total free IGF-I , IGFBP-3 , C-reactive protein , non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFAs ) , adiponectin , ghrelin - A 3-hour one-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp - MRS DEXA scan - Cortisol clearance rate assessment - Fat biopsy Washout Period Crossover first treatment phase GH Placebo , subject 4-week washout period treatment cross another 12-week treatment phase either GH Placebo . During time , subject advise maintain stable diet weight . Visit 3 , Baseline Assessment Second Treatment Phase ( Week 16 +/- 1 week ) ( outpatient ) The following description assessment perform : - Physical exam medical history - Vital sign , e.g. , pulse blood pressure measurement - Height weight - Waist circumference measurement - Concomitant medication review - Urine pregnancy test female child-bearing subject - Fasting blood assessment , e.g. , hemoglobin , glucose , insulin , C-peptide , serum total free IGF-I , IGFBP-3 , C-reactive protein , non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFAs ) , adiponectin , ghrelin - A 3-hour one-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp - MRS DEXA scan - Cortisol clearance rate assessment - Fat biopsy - Treatment exchange Placebo GH Visit 4 , Final Assessment Second Treatment Phase ( Week 28 +/- 1 week ) ( inpatient ) The following description assessment perform end second treatment phase either GH Placebo . Subjects also monitor safety collection follow : - Physical exam medical history - Vital sign , e.g. , pulse blood pressure measurement - Height weight - Waist circumference measurement - Concomitant medication review - Urine pregnancy test female child-bearing subject - Fasting blood assessment , e.g. , hemoglobin , glucose , insulin , C-peptide , serum total free IGF-I , IGFBP-3 , C-reactive protein , non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFAs ) , adiponectin , ghrelin - A 3-hour one-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp - MRS DEXA scan - Cortisol clearance rate assessment - Fat biopsy Because potentially long duration Visits 1 , 2 4 , study either divide two separate admission upon prior arrangement do one admission , depend subject 's wish schedule .</detailed_description>
