	<brief_summary>Most study demonstrate untreated bacterial vaginosis increase rate preterm birth .

However , treatment symptomatic bacterial vaginosis associate modest reduction subsequent preterm birth . Potential mechanisms reduction include decrease peripheral maternal pro-inflammatory activation TH1 inflammatory cascade treatment , however direct pathway elucidate . The approved treatment bacterial vaginosis pregnancy consist Metronidazole 500mg BID 7 day . A complete understanding effect Metronidazole maternal inflammation would useful design strategy reduce rate preterm birth . This study propose determine effect standard treatment BV carriage maternal serum marker inflammation . This accomplished give patient asymptomatic BV either standard treatment metronidazole placebo 7 day . Blood drawn compare level Interleukins 1 6 well Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha .</brief_summary>
