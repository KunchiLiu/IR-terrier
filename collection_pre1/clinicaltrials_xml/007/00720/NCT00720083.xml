	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Vandetanib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether give chemotherapy together radiation therapy effective without vandetanib treat patient head neck cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study give chemotherapy together radiation therapy see well work compare give chemotherapy radiation therapy together vandetanib treat patient high-risk stage III stage IV head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy ( RT ) With Without Vandetanib Treating Patients With High-Risk Stage III Stage IV Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To screen indication addition vandetanib chemoradiotherapy may prolong disease-free survival compare combination chemoradiotherapy patient resect , high-risk stage III IV head neck squamous cell carcinoma . Secondary - To determine whether treatment regimen deliver safely successfully follow surgical resection advance head neck cancer . - To estimate locoregional progression , distant metastasis , overall survival rate patient treated regimen . - To examine distribution select biomarkers may include limited EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor , total phosphorylated ) , E-cadherin , pMAPK ( phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase ) , pAKT , Stat-3 ( signal transducer activator transcription 3 ) , Ki-67 , COX-2 ( cyclooxygenase 2 ) , cyclin B1 ( G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B1 ) expression group patient explore potential correlation marker ultimate treatment outcome OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord Zubrod performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) primary site disease ( oral cavity/hypopharynx v larynx v oropharynx , HPV+ ( human papillomavirus positive ) v oropharynx , HPV- ( human papillomavirus negative ) ) . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 time week 6.5 week receive cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , 22 , 43 radiotherapy . - Arm II : Patients undergo radiotherapy arm I receive cisplatin IV 1 hour week begin day 1 radiotherapy . Patients also receive oral vandetanib daily begin 14 day prior start radiotherapy . In arm , treatment continue 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tissue sample patient collect review . Tissue patient oropharyngeal carcinoma analyze human papillomavirus . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 4 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
