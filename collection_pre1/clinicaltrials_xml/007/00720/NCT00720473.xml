	<brief_title>Lamotrigine Therapy Geriatric Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We use MRI technique neuropsychological test investigate potential marker treatment response elderly bipolar depress patient receive lamotrigine age-matched , non-depressed control . We intend test hypothesis : 1 . At least 50 % old subject bipolar depression respond treatment lamotrigine evidence 50 % reduction Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . In addition , treatment lamotrigine safe well tolerate evidence drop-out rate less 10 % due adverse effect . 2 . Compared healthy age-matched , non-demented , non-depressed control , subject geriatric bipolar depression demonstrate abnormality cerebral energy metabolism assess elevated level glutamate lactate , decrease level NAA , use 1H MRS 4T . 3 . Successful treatment lamotrigine geriatric bipolar depression result decrease lactate glutamate , elevation NAA . 4 . Baseline measure executive function information processing speed ( measure performance Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( WCST ) , Trails A B Stroop test ) impair subject geriatric bipolar depression compare healthy control . These measure improve successful treatment lamotrigine correlate improvement marker cerebral energy metabolism ( lactate , glutamate , NAA ) .</detailed_description>
