	<brief_summary>Several open-label study report thalidomide efficacy induce clinical remission steroid taper refractory Inflammatory Bowel disease ( IBD ) , adults child . This randomized placebo control ( RCT ) double blind study , evaluate efficacy thalidomide induce clinical remission 8 week refractory IBD patient age 2-20 year . The primary hypothesis study thalidomide would effective placebo induce clinical remission . The RCT phase follow open-label phase , evaluate efficacy safety thalidomide thalidomide responder , total follow one year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) particularly debilitate . They present chronic-recurrent symptom often seriously affect patient 's quality life , acute complication may need surgical intervention long-term risk evolution cancer ulcerative colitis . Although onset common third decade life , one third IBD case diagnose age sixteen , young patient , especially Crohn 's disease , increase Western country . Recent study United Kingdom , Sweden United States report incidence 5-7 new case IBD every year per 100,000 subject &lt; 16 year age , increase trend last two decade . IBD-related morbidity cause special concern childhood-onset case , since disease compromise height weight development . This even worsen patient poor disease control , need steroid treatment multiple course and/or long period time . There various drug treatment available management IBD , patient , course illness , become resistant conventional treatment , develop serious adverse effect immunosuppressive drug . A particular challenge represent patient ( especially child ) fail respond conventional treatment , steroid-dependent , suffer serious side effect steroid use . Thalidomide first market early 1960s sedative drug sadly gain notoriety teratogenic effect . After year tragedy , thalidomide rediscover immunomodulator anti-inflammatory drug , anti tumor necrosis factor-alfa property . Thalidomide approve treatment multiple myeloma erythema nodosum leprorum . It also test , beneficial effect , variety inflammatory disease , especially involve skin mucous membrane : recurrent aphthous stomatitis , oral oesophageal ulcer HIV , oral genital ulcer intestinal symptom Behcet 's syndrome , graft versus host disease , skin manifestation systemic lupus erythematosus , sarcoidosis , tuberculosis . In disease , especially case resistant conventional treatment , thalidomide seem promising role secondary therapeutic option . The safety efficacy thalidomide IBD recently evaluate several open-label study adult child , long-term follow . A total approximately 200 patient steroid-resistant steroid-dependent IBD treat thalidomide . Overall , drug effective induce clinical remission 20-70 % patient ( average 40 % ) . 60-100 % patient ( average 70 % ) clinical response . Steroid-tapering possible 60-100 % case . The frequent side effect thalidomide IBD case neuropathy , mainly report cumulative dose-dependent . Other possible side effect constipation , sedation , dermatitis , mood disturbance , vertigo , cephalea , hypertension , hormonal alteration . In experience center , thalidomide effective achieve clinical remission several child , adolescent , young adult intractable IBD . From 1998 2004 twenty-eight patient refractory moderate-severe IBD ( 19 CD , 9 UC ) receive thalidomide 1.5-2.5 mg/kg/day . Remission achieve thalidomide 21 28 ( 75 % ) patient ( 17 CD , 4 UC ) . Mean duration remission 34.5 month . Sixteen 20 ( 80 % ) patient suspended steroid . Reversible neuropathy occur seven 28 ( 25 % ) patient , cumulative dos 28 g. Other side effect require thalidomide suspension vertigo/somnolence ( one case ) , agitation/ hallucination ( one case ) . The aim study evaluate efficacy thalidomide therapy child , adolescent young adult refractory Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UD ) , total follow one year . The study divide two phase : - Phase I : randomize placebo control double blind study , evaluate efficacy thalidomide refractory IBD patient , 8 week . - Phase II : open-label study , evaluate efficacy safety thalidomide patient responder Thalidomide Phase I , total follow one year . Analysis stratify Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . Given hypothesis thalidomide effective induce clinical remission 8 week 60 % patient Crohn 's disease , 55 % patient ulcerative colitis , compare 20 % patient placebo , significance 0.05 % power 80 % , estimate needed sample size 124 patient .</detailed_description>
