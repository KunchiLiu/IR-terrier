	<brief_summary>Each year 730,000 Americans experience stroke . Forty percent leave significant paralysis one arm . Certain types physical therapy , example constraint induce movement therapy ( CIMT ) , show effective improving arm function . However , subject , improvement modest .

	<brief_title>Improving Stroke Rehabilitation : Spacing Effect D-cycloserine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year , 730,000 Americans experience stroke . Forty percent leave persistent impairment upper extremity function . Although scientifically vet rehabilitation therapy impairment start emerge , current treatment generally unsatisfactory . Therapies seek engage neuroplastic mechanism constitute one approach problem . A good example constraint induce movement therapy ( CIMT ) , treatment seek , extensive functional task practice , overcome acquire intentional predisposition use spar arm ( learned non-use ) , improve motor function affect arm . CIMT test host trial , recently multicenter randomize control trial ( RCT ) - EXCITE trial . These trial generally demonstrate average , treatment show efficacy , result RCT indicate efficacious `` standard '' therapy . However , problem CIMT readily identify pose research challenge : 1 ) average , efficacy limit ; 2 ) fraction subject show substantial benefit . We propose address two problem pilot RCT 20 subject test two modification standard CIMT : 1 ) addition drug , d-cycloserine , may enhance neuroplasticity potentiate NMDA-glutamate receptor-mediated learning mechanism ; 2 ) delivery fixed amount CIMT great number day , accord learn research , may enhance long-term retention gain . All subject trial receive CIMT . Subjects randomize one 4 group : A. CIMT + d-cycloserine , condense treatment B. CIMT + d-cycloserine , less condensed treatment C. CIMT + placebo , condense treatment D. CIMT + placebo , less condensed treatment The primary outcome measure performance Wolf Motor Function Test ( time ) 3 month completion treatment .</detailed_description>
