	<detailed_description>Subjects first test possible growth hormone deficiency . This do administer two intravenous medication stimulate growth hormone secretion measure growth hormone blood every 30 minute follow administration . Once result enough subject split cohort subject growth hormone deficient normal growth hormone . The two group undergo various test design assess component cardiovascular risk .
