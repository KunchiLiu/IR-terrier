	<brief_title>Pazopanib Versus Sunitinib Treatment Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate efficacy safety pazopanib compare sunitinib subject advance RCC receive prior systemic therapy advance metastatic RCC . Subjects randomize 1:1 ratio receive either 800mg pazopanib administer daily orally continuous dose 50mg sunitinib administer 6-week cycle : 50mg orally daily 4 week follow 2 week treatment . Subjects permit receive supportive care throughout study include transfusion blood blood product , treatment antibiotic , anti-emetics , anti-diarrheal agent , analgesic , erythropoietin , bisphosphonates , appropriate . The study treatment continue subject experience disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdraw consent , death .</detailed_description>
