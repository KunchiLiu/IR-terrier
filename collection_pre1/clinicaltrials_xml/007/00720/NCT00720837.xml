	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn new therapy device call Visualase® Thermal Therapy System ( device use laser kill tumor cell guide use magnetic resonance thermal image [ MRTI ] ) . The Visualase® Thermal Therapy System use treat metastatic brain tumor . Researchers want find possible use new device patient metastatic brain tumor ( ) , measure 3 centimeter ( cm ) small . The safety device also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Temperature Imaging &amp; Imaging-Guided Laser Induced Thermal Therapy Treatment Metastatic Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Device Process : The Visualase® Thermal Therapy System combine 3 FDA-approved device : Visualase Cooled Laser Application System , delivers laser ( energy ) beam tumor tissue ; PhoTex 15 Diode Laser Series , laser ; Visualase ENVISION Workstation , computer system help surgeon plan monitor treatment . The Visualase® Thermal Therapy System use study give patient type therapy call Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy ( LITT ) . LITT use laser light heat destroy affect tissue ; sometimes refer tissue ablation . In LITT , small fiber-optic applicator place directly tumor heating perform inside , may lead destruction tumor . During heat process , MRTI use watch temperature around applicator make sure tumor receive enough treatment normal tissue around tumor get hot . LITT less invasive open surgical procedure . There radiation-related side effect , limit number time repeat . Also , since procedure perform use MRTI , doctor find right away effective therapy use special imaging sequence , may also show survive tumor cell . Screening : Before enroll study , `` screening test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . The following test procedure perform within 14 day treatment : - Your medical history record , ask question treatment metastatic brain tumor ( ) . - You complete physical exam . - You neurological exam . This include exam function nerve head , exam visual field , test reflexes , muscle strength , sens . - You MRI scan brain within 30 day LITT therapy . - Women able child must negative urine pregnancy test within 48 hour ( 2 day ) treatment . Study Treatment : If find eligible take part study , schedule treatment brain tumor ( ) use Visualase® Thermal Therapy System . You bring special operating room call BrainSUITE® . The BrainSUITE® regular operating room built-in MRI machine use take picture surgery . The imaging procedure perform anesthesia ( either deep sedation fully `` asleep '' ) . A standard tumor biopsy perform . Then , use needle holder , laser applicator place within tumor . MRI scan take make sure applicator place properly . The biopsy applicator placement take 1 hour . After , laser treatment perform . At time , MRI scan take procedure . The treatment last 5 10 minute . After treatment , follow-up MRI scan take , may take 30-60 minute longer . If tumor tissue leave , laser may move slightly second treatment perform . Once complete , needle remove , incision close standard way . If tumor biopsy result reveal tumor come back , LITT perform . Other treatment option available discussed doctor prior surgery . Study Tests : After laser treatment , observe hospital 24 hour . While hospital , 1 day treatment , physical neurological exam , well compute tomography ( CT ) scan brain ( without use contrast dye inject bloodstream ) make sure problem treatment . This standard biopsy . Follow-Up Testing : You see doctor follow-up test 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month treatment . It important return see doctor schedule visit , even feel fine . At follow-up visit , doctor perform complete physical neurological exam . You also MRI visit , start 1-month visit . This investigational study . Each part Visualase® Thermal Therapy System FDA approve use deliver LITT patient . Up 22 patient take part clinical research study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
