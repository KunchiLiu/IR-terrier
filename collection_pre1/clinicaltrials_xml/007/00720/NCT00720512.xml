	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , oxaliplatin , leucovorin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective without bevacizumab treat metastatic colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study second-line combination chemotherapy see well work compare without bevacizumab treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer receive first-line chemotherapy bevacizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Second-Line Combination Chemotherapy With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Who Have Received First-Line Chemotherapy Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare progression-free survival second-line chemotherapy without bevacizumab patient metastatic colorectal cancer receive first-line chemotherapy bevacizumab . Secondary - To compare overall survival , response rate , safety profile second-line chemotherapy regimens patient . - To conduct pharmacogenomics assessment candidate variant VEGF gene evaluate association progression-free survival study outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1-2 ) , disease-free interval last administration first-line chemotherapy metastatic disease ( ≤ 3 month vs &gt; 3 month ) , type second-line chemotherapy ( irinotecan hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil [ FOLFIRI ] v oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil [ mFOLFOX-6 ] ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive either irinotecan hydrochloride 1 hour oxaliplatin 1 hour day 1 . Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV 46 hour continuously begin day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive combination chemotherapy arm I bevacizumab IV day 1 . Treatment arm repeat every 2 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Existing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sample assess pharmacogenomics marker predictive response , resistance , toxicity bevacizumab . Samples analyze via RT-PCR , array comparative genomic hybridization , fluorescence situ hybridization , sequence candidate gene , immunohistochemistry . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
