	<brief_title>This Multi-center , Single Arm , Open Label Study Intended Provide Expanded Access Plerixafor Patients With Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) , Hodgkin 's Disease ( HD ) Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) Who Are Receive Treatment With Autologous Peripheral Stem Cell Transplant .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Expanded Access Program ( EAP ) ( protocol number MOZ00607 ) open label study intend provide access plerixafor patient non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma , Hodgkin 's Disease , Multiple Myeloma receive treatment autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant . Patients previously fail stem cell mobilization attempt previously receive autologous allogeneic stem cell transplant eligible enroll program . The standard care regimen stem cell mobilization include growth factor , G-CSF , increase peripheral blood stem cell . Plerixafor give even prior dos standard treatment G-CSF . The combination G-CSF plerixafor potential increase number circulate stem cell . The stem cell develop specialized white blood cell platelet necessary immune system function normal blood clotting . The stem cell remove process call apheresis , blood drawn patient , stem cell separate plasma , plasma return patient . The separated stem cell frozen , similar blood banking process . The patient receives chemotherapy accord institutional standard . After chemotherapy , stem cell transplant intend replenish cell bone marrow may destroy chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
