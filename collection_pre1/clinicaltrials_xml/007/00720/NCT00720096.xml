	<brief_summary>This pilot study help u determine success use special technique call microarray technology examine cancer gene order predict individual woman respond one two therapy , liposomal doxorubicin topotecan , effective treat ovarian cancer return ( recurrent ovarian cancer ) . We believe study may lead mean microarray technology predict effective treatment decision , base genetic characteristic tumor tissue , woman recurrent ovarian cancer . Another purpose study determine quickly woman recurrent ovarian cancer respond treatment ( treatment response rate ) evaluate accuracy genomic prediction . Recent data suggest microarray technology predict patient 's response chemotherapy ; yet prove forward-looking study conduct research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genomic Directed Salvage Chemotherapy With Either Liposomal Doxorubicin Or Topotecan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients take part study initial visit undergo CT guide core biopsy . Using tissue CT guide core biopsy , microarray analysis perform help predict two drug appear well suit individual genomic factor . The result result assigned treatment either liposomal doxorubicin topotecan . Patients receive liposomal doxorubicin - IV chemotherapeutic treatment occur 3 time , 28 day apart , week 1,5 , 9 . At visit patient evaluate blood work check liver test electrolyte . Every 8 week patient radiologic evaluation tumor . Patients receive topotecan - IV chemotherapeutic treatment occur 4 time , 21 day apart , week 1,4,7 , 10 . At visit patient evaluate blood work check level liver test electrolyte . Every 8 week patient radiologic evaluation tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must history histologically cytologically confirm epithelial ovarian cancer recurrence . Must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral compute tomography CT ) scan . May 2 prior chemotherapy regimen , least one regimen contain platinum , disease recurrence progression occur 0 12 month ( 1 365 day ) platinumcontaining regimen . Patients treated consolidation treatment allow consolidation consider separate regimen . Hormonal therapy immunotherapy consider prior chemotherapy regimen . Hormonal therapy give treat patient 's cancer stop least 30 day prior dose trial . Typical lowdose hormone replacement therapy treat postmenopausal symptom may continue treat physician 's discretion . Life expectancy &gt; 6 month . ECOG performance status 2 less ( Karnofsky 60 % ) . Must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte 3,000/microL absolute neutrophil count 1,500/ microL platelet 100,000/microL total bilirubin ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ( SGOT ) ] /alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ( SGPT ) ] ≤2.5 X ULN creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance 60mL/min/1.73m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Measurable disease CT must consider amenable biopsy Core method ( core biopsy may radiographically nonradiographically perform ) . Potential ability obtain core material must review Principal Investigator ( PI ) and/or designate prior enrollment . Must consent biopsy part enrol trial . Patients reproductive potential must use adequate contraceptive method ( e.g . abstinence , intrauterine device , oral contraceptive , barrier device spermicide surgical sterilization ) treatment three month complete treatment . Must Multiple Gated Acquisition ( MUGA ) scan 2d echocardiogram indicate ejection fraction &gt; 50 % institutional standard within 42 day prior first dose study drug . The method use baseline must use later monitoring . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study version 13 , 01/10/08 MCC 15042 16 recovered adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . May receive investigational agent concurrently . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition liposomal doxorubicin topotecan . Myocardial infarction within 6 month . History cardiac disease , New York Heart Association Class II great , clinical evidence congestive heart failure . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Women pregnant . Women breastfeed discontinue breastfeeding . Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) positive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction increase toxicity . Patients may malignancies prior 5 year nonmetastatic , locallycontrolled , nonmelanomatous cutaneous cancer . Patients receive radiation 25 % marrowbearing area .</criteria>
