	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving bevacizumab together erlotinib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together erlotinib work radiation therapy temozolomide treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Erlotinib After Radiation Therapy Temozolomide Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme Gliosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine overall survival patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) unmethylated MGMT promoter treat bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride radiotherapy temozolomide . Secondary - To determine 12- 24-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient newly diagnose GBM unmethylated MGMT promoter treat regimen . - To assess radiographic response rate . - To perform correlative tissue assay . - To collect safety data combination bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride patient newly diagnose GBM unmethylated MGMT promoter treat bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride radiotherapy temozolomide . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo radiotherapy ( either intensity-modulated radiation therapy 3-D conformal radiotherapy ) daily 5 day week receive oral temozolomide concurrently radiotherapy daily 6 week ( plan ) . Patients whose tumor methylated MGMT promoter remove study . Approximately 4 week completion radiotherapy temozolomide , patient receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Treatment bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow approximately 30 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
