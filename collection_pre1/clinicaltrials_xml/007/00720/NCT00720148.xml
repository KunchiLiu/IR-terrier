	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial Bortezomib Sunitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I study assess combination bortezomib sunitinib patient solid tumor refractory standard chemotherapy . The study take place two stage . In stage , patient receive sunitinib orally food daily 4 week bortezomib injection vein week 4 week . This follow 2 week rest . This 6-week period call one cycle . In stage 1 , maximum 10 patient treat sequentially increase dos sunitinib ( fix dose bortezomib ) . Each dose level must well tolerate next patient start treatment next dose level . Whichever high dose sunitinib well tolerate use next stage . In stage 2 , maximum 20 patient treat sequentially increase dos bortezomib ( fix dose sunitinib ) . Each dose level must well tolerate next patient start treatment next dose level . Together , two stage determine high dos sunitinib bortezomib well tolerate give combination . Determining optimal dos primary aim study . Patients also follow see whether tumor responds treatment . If patient 's cancer remain stable improves , repeat treatment cycle . There defined end date study since patient follow duration survival .</detailed_description>
