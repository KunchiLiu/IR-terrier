	<brief_title>ICU Family Communication Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three decade research end-of-life care United States indicate people die often spend final day receive care would choose . The intensive care unit ( ICU ) important focus effort improve end-of-life care death common set - approximately 20 % Americans die shortly stay ICU - also care highly technologic , thus , expensive . As result prior work develop wealth knowledge improve communication decision-making concern end-of-life care ICU . One important insight knowledge need development facilitator-assisted interdisciplinary communication intervention . This intervention , design improve communication decision-making end-of-life care ICU , offer significant potential benefit improve patient- family-centered care five reason : 1 ) communication integral component clinician skill affect aspects end-of-life care ; 2 ) physician nurse practice demonstrate adequate skill communicate end-of-life care , especially ICU acute care set ; 3 ) intervention focus improve communication within ICU team team family show reduce `` prolongation dying '' common ICU , remain unclear generalize success hospital ; 4 ) recent randomize trial France use intervention base prior research show dramatic reduction symptom anxiety , depression , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) among family member patient 's death , unclear translate finding hospital U.S. ; 5 ) sustainable , generalizable , widely available intervention improve communication end-of-life care available . The long-term objective : 1 ) demonstrate efficacy generalizable facilitator-assisted interdisciplinary communication intervention ICU improve family patient outcomes ; 2 ) demonstrate feasibility make intervention routine part clinical practice ICU setting . The study advance Nursing science address important area emphasis within Nursing science key component National Institute Nursing Research 's strategic plan . One fifth death America occur intensive care unit nurse provide key component care set . With age population coincident advance medical technology , patient likely die unsuccessful trial intensive care . Prior research suggest intervention improve communication end-of-life care ICU may reduce prolongation die common ICU setting time improve quality care patient family member . Unfortunately , prior research provide clear generalizable intervention easily implement academic community hospital . The propose randomized trial test feasible generalizable intervention improve communication end-of-life care improve patient family outcome . The consent form use study address purpose , procedure , risk , alternative , benefit , information -- include emphasis voluntary nature research assurances confidentiality . The conceptual model intervention address three component self-efficacy theory : 1 ) knowledge , base team 's prior research identify component communication ICU family conference associate improved patient family outcome ; 2 ) attitude , inform attachment theory apply clinician-patient relationship communication ; 3 ) communication behavior inform principle mediation base identify resolve conflict healthcare set . The intervention include following step : 1 ) in-person interview facilitator family prior family conference order discuss family 's concern , question , need unique communication characteristic address family conference ; 2 ) pre-conference meeting facilitator , physician ( ) , nurse ( ) , clinicians brief summary describe family 's concern , question , need , unique communication characteristic present discuss ; 3 ) facilitator participation family conference ; 4 ) facilitator follow family throughout ICU stay . Prior facilitator 's involvement , intervention control group meet research coordinator obtain consent family distribute baseline questionnaires ; research coordinator also contact intervention control group family time follow-up questionnaire ( 3 6 month discharge death ) notify questionnaire send ask question . The contact research coordinator expect enhance response rate group . For control group , contact research coordinator provide `` attention control . '' The research coordinator provide intervention component provide facilitator ( i.e. , discussion concern question prior family conference ; brief summary clinician ; participation family conference ; follow-up contact family conference duration ICU stay ) . A component facilitator 's role also include help identify need family conference scheduling conference . Therefore , part multi-faceted intervention , anticipate family conference occur earlier frequently intervention arm . After initial family conference , may additional family conference facilitator participate conference intervention group .</detailed_description>
