	<brief_summary>We propose study compare measure brain energy metabolism geriatric bipolar individual healthy old adult . We would also like investigate change brain energy metabolite vivo creatine kinase ( CK ) enzymatic activity associate CoQ10 administration old bipolar individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CoQ10 Geriatric Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses 1 . At baseline , forward rate constant ( kfor ) CK enzymatic activity frontal lobe old subject bipolar depression significantly decrease relative age-matched healthy control . 2 . After 8 week treatment , bipolar depression subject demonstrate increase kfor CK 8 week CoQ 10 treatment . 3 . Increases CK forward rate constant ( kfor ) correlate improvement subject ' mood state assess Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . 4 . Baseline measure executive function information processing speed ( measure performance Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( WCST ) , Trails A B Stroop test ) impair subject geriatric bipolar depression compare healthy control . These measure improve successful treatment CoQ10 correlate increase CK forward rate constant ( kfor ) . Summary : A review literature suggest distinct pattern bioenergetic change , possibly relate mitochondrial dysfunction abnormal CK function , old adult individual bipolar disorder . As opposed rudimentary measurement static metabolite concentration , novel use MT-MRS individual offer insight enzyme kinetics CK , specifically examine rate ATP form PCr . From previous investigation would seem dietary-supplement , CoQ10 , able improve efficiency mitochondrial function subject alter bioenergetics . We propose measure CK activity PCr turnover rate CoQ10 treatment , overall aim understand metabolic relationship brain bioenergetic alteration treatment CoQ10 geriatric bipolar depression .</detailed_description>
