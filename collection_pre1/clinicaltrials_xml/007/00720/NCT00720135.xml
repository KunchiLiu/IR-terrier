	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , fusion protein cytokine therapy , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving fusion protein cytokine therapy together rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose fusion protein cytokine therapy give rituximab treat patient B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fusion Protein Cytokine Therapy After Rituximab Treating Patients With B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) DI-Leu16-IL2 ( DI-Leu16-IL2 immunocytokine ) follow peripheral blood B cell depletion rituximab patient B-cell NHL . II . To investigate optimal biological dose ( OBD ) DI-Leu16-IL2 follow peripheral blood B cell depletion rituximab patient B-cell NHL , may differ MTD . III . To describe toxicity associate propose DI-Leu16-IL2 regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate immunogenicity measure induction DI-Leu16-IL2-specific antibody . II . To evaluate pharmacokinetics DI-Leu16-IL2 . III . To document clinical response associate proposed therapy survival endpoint enrol patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study DI-Leu16-IL2 immunocytokine . Patients receive DI-Leu16-IL2 immunocytokine IV 4 hour 4 consecutive Wednesdays . Patients detectable CD20-positive B-cells pretreatment also receive rituximab IV 4 consecutive Tuesdays . Treatment repeat every 6 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
