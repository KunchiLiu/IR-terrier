	<brief_title>Topical Tazarotene Treating Patients With Basal Cell Skin Cancer Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome Chest Back</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To expand refine chemopreventive strategy individual basal cell nevus syndrome ( BCNS ) chest back , high risk development basal cell carcinoma ( BCCs ) . - To determine whether tazarotene 0.1 % cream apply chest two year reduce number basal cell carcinoma ( BCCs ) observe , compare number expect , base change BCC number observe month 0-12 . Secondary - To compare difference total BCC burden ( measure total lesion surface area ) chest back various time point aggregate interval interest . - To determine whether detectable wash-in wash-out period tazarotene effect . - Explore use random effect model longitudinal analysis total lesion time . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I : Patients apply 0.1 % tazarotene cream month 0-12 vehicle ( placebo ) month 13-36 daily chest absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients apply vehicle ( placebo ) month 0-12 0.1 % tazarotene cream month 13-36 daily chest absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Treated chest untreated back evaluated 3 month interval 36 month .</detailed_description>
