	<criteria>Healthy determine responsible physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Japanese ethnic origin ( define born Japan four ethnic Japanese grandparent able speak Japanese ) Male female 18 65 year age . Female subject must non childbearing potential include premenopausal female document ( medical report verification ) hysterectomy double oophorectomy postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea 6 month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) 6 week postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy . Male subject must agree use one contraception method list Section 8.1 . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication 90 day postlast dose . Body weight &gt; 45 kg body mass index within range 1828 kg/m2 inclusive . Average QTc ( B ) &lt; 450 msec take triplicate assessment screen . No clinically active relevant abnormality 12lead ECG screen 24h Holter ECG . Normal spirometry ( FEV1 ≥ 80 % predict , FEV1/FVC ≥ 70 % ) . Nonsmokers ( never smoke smoking &gt; 6 month &lt; 10 pack year history ( Pack year = ( cigarette per day smoked/20 ) x number year smoke ) ) A sign date write informed consent obtain subject The subject capable give informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form Available complete study Any clinically important abnormality identify screen medical assessment ( physical examination/medical history ) , clinical laboratory test , ECG ( 12lead ) . 24hr Holter monitoring outside normal limit . A history breathing problem ( i.e . history asthmatic symptomatology , unless asthma childhood resolve long require maintenance therapy exclusion ) . A mean QTc ( B ) value screen &gt; 450msec , ECG suitable QT measurement ( e.g . LBBB poorly define termination T wave ) . A history elevate rest blood pressure mean blood pressure high 140/90 mmHg screen . A mean heart rate outside range 4090 bpm screen . The subject positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A minimum list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates benzodiazepine . The detection drug legitimate medical use would necessarily exclusion study participation . The detection alcohol would exclusion screen would need negative predose study . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . A positive test HIV antibody ( determined local SOP 's ) . History high alcohol consumption within 3months study define : average weekly intake great 21 unit average daily intake great 3 unit ( male ) , defined average weekly intake great 14 unit average daily intake great 2 unit ( female ) . One unit equivalent halfpint ( 220mL ) beer 1 ( 25ml ) measure spirit 1 glass ( 125ml ) wine . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Use prescription nonprescription drug , ( except simple analgesic eg paracetamol ) , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ( Hypericum ) ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol .
