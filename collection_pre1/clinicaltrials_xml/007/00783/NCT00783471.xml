	<brief_title>Docetaxel Intermittent-Erlotinib ( Tarceva® ) In Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination chemotherapy [ docetaxel ] continuous administration target drug block molecular machinery cancer cell growth [ erlotinib ] fail improve efficacy only-chemotherapy patient metastatic lung cancer non-small cell histology type . It yet know whether administer target drug intermittently could result improved efficacy combination . This multicenter randomize Phase II trial aim determine active dose sequence intermittent erlotinib docetaxel treat patient advance Non-Small-Lung-Cancer.Patients randomly assign one two treatment arm : receive 12-days course erlotinib either docetaxel [ arm A ] docetaxel administration [ arm B ] .Treatment repeat every 21 days.Patients evaluate every 2 cycle ( ~6 week ) response use RECIST criterion . Those patient achieve stable disease well continue therapy total 8 cycle . Those patient experience progressive disease take study . Biopsy material assess biomarkers .</detailed_description>
