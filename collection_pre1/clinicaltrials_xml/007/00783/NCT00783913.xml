	<brief_summary>This study determine electrical brain stimulation movement practice improve ability stroke patient reach object movement practice alone . People 18 85 year old stroke may eligible study . Participants randomly assign one two study group : movement training active ( tDCS ) movement train sham ( tDCS ) . Participants undergo 1-hour movement training ( tDCS ) session twice day , 5 day week , 3 week . For session , subject sit front computer screen show target ( round dot ) cursor ( line ) . Participants instructed move cursor various target computer screen fast accurately possible , control position cursor move arm , rest mechanical device . Participants receive real sham ( tDCS ) movement training session . For ( tDCS ) , electrode sponge soak tap water place scalp forehead . A small electrical current pass electrode . The stimulation last 20 minute . Patients follow test four time study - 1 ) start movement train 2 ) ( tDCS ) course training ( tDCS ) , 3 ) complete training ( tDCS ) , 4 ) 3 month complete training ( tDCS ) : Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use magnetic field radio wave take picture brain . Functional MRI ( fMRI ) show part brain use task perform . For test , subject lie table slide scanner . A computer screen see inside scanner . During scan , subject may ask study task lie still 20 minute time . Movement function test - Measurement arm stiffness - Moving arm actively resistance - Picking object move quickly possible - Performing daily living task like buttoning , dress walk - Performing task wear glove monitor position arm - Completing questionnaire ability perform daily activity movement level tiredness Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) TMS use magnet stimulate brain way different ( tDCS ) . This study u ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals suffer stroke may benefit development new rehabilitative intervention improve motor recovery stroke . Objective : The objective protocol test hypothesis active training complex upper extremity visuomotor task combine anodal transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) use activate affect hemisphere improves functionality reach affect upper-extremity comparison training combine sham tDCS stroke patient . The Study population : The study population include chronic ( 3 month ) stroke patient . Design : The study follow factorial design subject undergo several session complex visuomotor task train upper extremity . One half patient undergo anodal transcranial direct current stimulation first 20 minute train session , control subject sham stimulation apply . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure study accuracy completion reach task . The primary endpoint study end 3 week training ( 15 day ) . Secondary endpoint measure include time reach , kinematic , functional measure . These measure take end train 3 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 18 85 year . Ability sit active hour chair ( wheelchair ) without cardiac , respiratory and/or pain disturbance assess screen visit . Willingness commit participate longterm followup study ( 3 month ) Willingness give write informed consent . Diagnosis first clinically apparent unilateral cortical subcortical stroke least 3 month prior study entry EXCLUSION CRITERIA : History severe neurological illness ( e.g . brain tumor , epilepsy acute seizure , polyneuropathy etc . ) severe cognitive impairment ( MMSE less 23 ) MRI contraindication . ( Cardiac pacemaker ; Intracardiac line ; Implanted medication pump ; Neural stimulators ; blood vessel , cochlear , eye implant ; Metal cranium except mouth ; Dental brace ; Metal fragment occupational exposure ; Surgical clip near brain ) . History alcohol drug abuse Active depression severity psychoactive medication change last 2 month , active psychosis , disruptive violent behavior , poor motivational capacity assess study physician patient question Aphasia language disturbance would interfere perform study task Uncontrolled medical problem ( e.g. , active cancer renal disease , type endstage pulmonary cardiovascular disease , diabetes , medical condition , determine study physician , would interfere participation study ) . Increased intracranial pressure evaluate clinical mean ( fundoscopic exam ) . Severe neglect ataxia would interfere completion study task . History one stroke stroke affect side brain , brainstem , cerebellum . Inflammation tissue , severe rheumatoid arthritis , abnormal function joint due arthritis affected arm use often .
