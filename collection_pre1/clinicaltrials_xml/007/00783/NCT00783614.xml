	<brief_title>Aspirin Antiretroviral Therapy HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease major health concern among person HIV infection . Our general hypothesis HIV-mediated inflammation injury vascular surface up-regulates thrombotic pathway lead damage blood vessel promote development cardiovascular disease . HIV drug treatment ( antiretroviral therapy ; ART ) may reduce inflammation vessel injury via suppression HIV replication , also include side effect toxicity may increase risk cardiovascular disease . In context , additional anti-inflammatory anti-thrombotic medication need . Acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) excellent candidate commonly use secondary prevention cardiovascular event general population , study examine 's use person HIV infection . The goal study generate pilot data regard change measure cardiovascular risk , determine reduction inflammatory thrombotic blood marker decrease blood vessel injury ( blood marker ) dysfunction ( assessment arterial elasticity ) , occur start ART aspirin among person HIV infection .</detailed_description>
