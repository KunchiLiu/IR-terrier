	<brief_summary>It hypothesize OGF biotherapy may safely administer combination gemcitabine individual unresectable pancreatic cancer . The study include two aim , first evaluate safety toxicity combination OGF gemcitabine chemotherapy . The second aim trial study efficacy OGF gemcitabine use combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Opioid Growth Factor ( OGF ) Gemcitabine : Novel Treatment Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer 4th lead cause cancer-related death United States median survival 3-6 month five-year survival rate 1 % make bad gastrointestinal malignancy . The reason poor prognosis related failure diagnose cancer early stage unresponsiveness pancreatic cancer conventional chemotherapy radiation therapy . Gemcitabine become standard care treatment advance pancreatic cancer ; however , mean survival gemcitabine report 5.6 month . Our research team discover novel biotherapy call Opioid Growth Factor ( OGF ) inhibit growth pancreatic cancer vitro , animal , human subject . A Phase 1 study OGF complete maximum tolerated dose , safety toxicity evaluate . Currently Phase 2 trial progress study efficacy OGF monotherapy respond standard treatment . Recent experiment basic science laboratory indicate mark additive benefit cancer inhibition OGF combine gemcitabine . Additionally , animal receive combination regime healthier treat gemcitabine alone suggest perhaps protective effect OGF chemotherapy toxicity . It hypothesize OGF may safely administer combination gemcitabine individual unresectable pancreatic cancer . In order test hypothesis 22 eligible naïve patient pancreatic cancer prospectively treat standard dos gemcitabine . Concomitantly , OGF administer weekly start 150 μg/kg increase Maximum tolerate dose 250 μg/kg order determine follow specific aim : 1 ) evaluate safety toxicity combination OGF biotherapy gemcitabine ; 2 ) determine whether combination therapy alter pharmacokinetics either agent ; 3 ) study efficacy combination therapy tumor size , patient survival , time progression disease . The long-term goal research team involve translation novel discovery basic science laboratory clinical practice ultimate goal improve survival patient devastate disease .</detailed_description>
