	<brief_title>Effects Rapid Genetic Counseling Testing Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Netherlands , approximately 12,000 woman diagnose breast cancer annually , 5-10 % carry mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene . Genetic counseling DNA test usually offer select patient primary treatment complete ( e.g . first year diagnosis ) . For woman mutation one two breast-ovarian cancer syndrome gene , chance second breast cancer high , therefore proportion woman may opt preventive measure addition immediate breast cancer treatment . Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy significantly reduce risk , associate reduction mortality . Genetic counseling test breast cancer typically take approximately 4-6 month complete . However , hospital laboratory able generate test result within 3 6 week . This technology rapid genetic test create new opportunity provide woman treat surgeon information potentially relevant decide available treatment option , include type surgery adjuvant therapy . The study focus newly diagnose breast cancer patient , prior receiving treatment , identify least 10 % risk carry mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene . We investigate whether woman recent diagnosis breast cancer make use rapid genetic counseling offer . Furthermore , investigate whether process genetic counseling ( subsequent DNA test ) influence choice treatment , whether rapid genetic counseling testing ( RGCT ) affect level risk perception , cancer-related worry distress , decisional satisfaction . This multicenter study employ randomize controlled trial . In 18 month period newly diagnose breast cancer patient recruit 13 hospital Amsterdam Utrecht region Netherlands . Eligible patient randomize either `` usual care '' ( UC ) arm study , RGCT arm study . The randomization do ratio 1:2 Women RGCT arm study refer genetic counseling within week diagnosis , prior primary surgery . Women UC condition receive standard advice care treat physician . Standardized questionnaire administer patient study entry , 6 12 month assess psychosocial outcome . The endpoint include : 1. choice clinical management strategy , include uptake direct bilateral mastectomy ( BLM ) delay preventive contralateral mastectomy ( PCM ) ; 2. cancer risk perception , cancer-related worry distress ; 3. knowledge genetic aspect breast cancer ; 4. decisional satisfaction ; 5. health-related quality life ( HRQL ) . The study also evaluate woman 's experience satisfaction RGCT ( i.e. , time quality service provide , perceived impact treatment decision , perceive need additional psychosocial service , etc. ) . Data surgical outcome abstract medical record . A subset woman interview obtain supplementary , qualitative data RGCT experience . This study provide essential information impact RGCT choice primary surgical treatment among woman breast cancer increase risk cancer hereditary basis , psychosocial effect RGCT process ensue treatment decision . It inform clinical geneticist , surgeon patient potential benefit risk RGCT , useful shape content process genetic counseling diagnostic early treatment phase breast cancer . The study also yield recommendation improve quality multidisciplinary care provide breast cancer clinic addition genetic expertise patient relatively high risk genetic predisposition breast cancer .</detailed_description>
