	<brief_title>Evaluating Effectiveness Community Exercise Program Reduce Risk Metabolic Syndrome Among Black Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome term use describe group risk factor coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The risk factor include abdominal obesity , insulin resistance , high cholesterol , high blood pressure . People live sedentary lifestyle get enough exercise risk develop metabolic syndrome CAD . Black Americans also increase risk metabolic syndrome CAD , particularly sibling young 60 year old premature CAD . Studies show people engage regular , moderate intensity exercise eliminate metabolic syndrome risk factor lead CAD ; however , many high-risk Black Americans take part regular exercise . The purpose study compare community-based , coach-led exercise program individual , self-led home-based exercise program examine program effective reduce metabolic syndrome risk factor lead CAD Black Americans . This study enroll Black Americans metabolic syndrome sibling premature CAD . Participants randomly assign ( individual ) either community-based exercise program ( C-FIT ) self-help home-based exercise program ( HOME ) . Participants C-FIT group 1 hour exercise two three time week community set supervise personal coach trainer 1 year . Participants SELF group undergo fitness evaluation instruct exercise . They also expect 1 hour exercise two three time week 1 year . Study visit occur baseline , Month 6 , Years 1 2 . At study visit , participant undergo follow : medical history review ; physical examination ; blood pressure measurement ; blood collection ; body measurement , include height , weight , waist circumference ; treadmill stress test ; strength test ; dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan measure body fat ; echocardiogram examine heart ; flow-mediated vasodilatation test brachial reactivity measure vascular function ; questionnaire diet , exercise habit , self-efficacy .</detailed_description>
