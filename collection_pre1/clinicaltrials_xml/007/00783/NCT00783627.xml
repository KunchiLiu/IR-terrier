	<brief_summary>Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) prevalent genetic disease haemoglobin.The underlie abnormality red blood cell ( RBC ) SCD presence abnormal sickle cell hemoglobin ( HbS ) , , deoxygenate , become relatively insoluble , form aggregate hemoglobin molecule within RBC cause rigid deformation cell . Acute pain vaso-occlusive crisis , stroke acute chest syndrome main acute complication , sometimes life-threatening , often lead organic functional squeal . Although common SS form SCD unique gene disorder , range clinical severity remarkably wide striking , suggest clinical polymorphism due modifier gene environmental factors.Most research effort focus biology haemoglobin red cell . Meanwhile , complex pathophysiology SCD undoubtedly influence many physiologic function vascular wall . In line hypothesis several report increase circulate level endothelium-derived surface molecule SCD patient suggest marked endothelial stress SCD . Similarly , process involve endothelium , leukocyte adhesion activation , may play role vascular occlusion . This accumulation data raise unanswered question mechanism endothelium maintenance regeneration SCD . Through mechanism , likely function dysfunction vascular endothelium contribute overall vascular pathobiology disease , include recurrent vaso-occlusions , stroke , leg ulcer , chronic organ ischemic damage , neovascularizing retinopathy affect nearly one-half ( 48 % ) survive patient fifth decade.Thus , group combine respective clinical biological expertise test hypothesis SCD condition specific endothelial stress dysfunction upon chronic Paracystic abnormal interaction circulate cell abnormal oxygen delivery tissue . Specifically , hypothesize chronic endothelial stress detachment activate endothelial cell require increase mobilisation Endothelial Progenitor Cells ( EPCs ) maintain endothelial homeostasis avoid major thromboembolic event vasospasm . Inappropriate mobilisation maturation EPCs SCD may participate severity disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sickle Cell Disease Endothelial Progenitor Cells ( EPCs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In bone marrow , reservoir EPCs exist , mobilize circulation need , example ischemia , situation may occur sickle cell disease . These cell able reach distant target participate neovascularisation process necessary tissue vascular healing . Conversely , abnormality maturation , mobilization homing process would contribute thrombotic ischemic risk associate ischemia . Furthermore , vascular stress encounter SCD lead detachment endothelial cell vessel . The number detach mature circulate endothelial cell ( CEC ) seem related vascular hurting . The balance EPCs CECs would thus informative vascular condition patient progression disease . A relatively high level EPCs would indicate prominence heal neoangiogenesis vasculogenesis process , increase level CECs would indicative severe progression disease . Our study publish others indicate number EPCs peripheral blood tightly regulate . Indeed , mediator inflammation could participate EPC mobilization recruitment diseased area local activation vascular endothelium . In context , sickle cell disease provokes transient occlusion episode , lead situation chronic ischemia different organ , sometimes acute episode . This suggest defect maintenance vascular integrity target organs.Within project , compare number EPCs CECs 25 SCD patient 25 normal individual search correlation severity disease . SCD patient potential confound factor may alter endothelial physiology ( drug , blood transfusion , hydroxyurea therapy ) exclude . In addition , analyse compare culture vivo phenotypic functional characteristic EPCs obtain patient control . We work bilateral hypothesis , since know whether SCD subject appropriate angiogenic balance ( high EPCs/CEC ratio functional EPCs ) face situation endothelial activation tissue hypoxia induce SCD . Therefore , quantitatively qualitatively study several distinct biological steps:1 . Evaluate number colony generate EPCs culture kinetics appearance patient ( major end point ) 2 . Enumerate EPCs CECs flow cytometry use specific set marker ( CD133 , CD146 , KDR ) .3 . Measure plasma concentration PlGF , VEGF , EPO , ET-1 , modulators angiogenesis.4 . Test correlation respective characteristic EPCs clinical vascular abnormality disease ( retinopathy assess angiography , nephropathy , leg ulcer ) severity vaso-occlusive crisis assess number length hospitalization previous year study .</detailed_description>
