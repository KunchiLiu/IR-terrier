	<brief_title>Study Vedolizumab ( MLN0002 ) Patients With Moderate Severe Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , phase 3 , randomize , blind , placebo-controlled study patient moderately severely active ulcerative colitis comprise two phase : - The Induction Phase , design establish efficacy safety vedolizumab induction clinical response remission . - The Maintenance Phase , design establish efficacy safety vedolizumab maintenance clinical response remission . The 6-week Induction Phase contain 2 cohort participant : Cohort 1 participant randomize treat double-blind study drug , Cohort 2 participant treat open-label vedolizumab . The second cohort enrol ensure sample size Induction Phase responder randomize Maintenance Study provide sufficient power Maintenance Study primary efficacy analysis . These participant contribute efficacy analysis perform Induction Study . Participants cohort assess treatment response Week 6 . In Maintenance Phase vedolizumab-treated participant Cohort 1 Cohort 2 demonstrate clinical response randomize 1:1:1 ratio double-blind treatment vedolizumab administer every 4 week ( Q4W ) , vedolizumab administer every 8 week ( Q8W ) , placebo . Vedolizumab-treated participant demonstrate response Week 6 continue treatment open-label vedolizumab , administer Q4W . Participants treat double-blind placebo Induction Phase continue double-blind placebo Maintenance Phase , regardless treatment response induction . The Maintenance Phase begin Week 6 conclude Week 52 assessment . After Week 52 assessment , participant meet protocol-defined criterion eligible enroll Study C13008 ( NCT00790933 ; Long-term Safety ) receive open-label vedolizumab treatment . Participants withdraw early ( prior Week 52 ) due sustain nonresponse , disease worsening , need rescue medication may also eligible Study C13008 . Participants enroll Study C13008 complete final on-study safety assessment Week 66 ( final safety visit 16 week last dose ) Maintenance Phase Study C13006 .</detailed_description>
