	<brief_summary>Brain vascular malformation , include arteriovenous malformation ( AVM ) , cavernous malformation ( CVM ) aneurysm , source life-threatening risk intracranial hemorrhage . The etiology pathogenesis unknown . There medical therapy presently available . Prevention spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) primary reason treat brain vascular malformation . The goal study : begin pilot study lay groundwork future clinical trial develop medical therapy decrease ICH risk . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) regulate extracellular matrix association various hemorrhagic brain disorder . MMP-9 consistently associate vascular wall instability hemorrhagic brain disorder . Doxycycline , non-specific MMP inhibitor , may enhance vascular stability , thus reduce risk spontaneous hemorrhage brain vascular malformation decrease MMP-9 activity .</brief_summary>
