	<brief_summary>Trauma patient risk serious head trauma . The consequence serious head trauma often life alter . Currently , method available rapidly assess severity head injury need neurosurgical intervention CT scan . This time consume test require transportation potentially unstable patient CT scanner . The investigator goal traumatic brain injury identify early patient may require neurosurgical intervention . Brain swelling ( elevate intracranial pressure ) transmit eye measure ultrasound . The investigator hypothesis test rule significant elevation intracranial pressure perform well CT scan . The investigator study aim demonstrate ultrasound optic nerve good CT scan ruling clinically significant elevation pressure within brain . After consent obtain , trauma patient indication undergo CT scan brain also undergo ultrasound eye . A radiologist review CT scan determine sign elevate intracranial pressure present . The investigator hope demonstrate bedside ultrasound perform trauma suite reliable ruling possibility elevate intracranial pressure . **Update August 2009** Currently , defer consent obtain REB allow u defer consent intervention minimal risk . As well , REB also approve phone consent interim .</brief_summary>
