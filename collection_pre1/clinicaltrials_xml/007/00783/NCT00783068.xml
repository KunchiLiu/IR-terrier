	<brief_summary>Rationale : The vagus nerve exert anti-inflammatory effect vitro animal experiment . This 'vagal anti-inflammatory pathway ' mediate nicotinergic α7nACh receptor selectively stimulate GTS-21 . Activation cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway via vagus nerve stimulation α7nAChR agonists improve outcome animal model endotoxemia , sepsis experimental arthritis . Up , anti-inflammatory effect oral administration GTS-21 human vivo investigate . Objective : Primary aim : investigate anti-inflammatory effect oral administration GTS-21 inflammatory response human endotoxemia model subsequent inflammation-induced subclinical organ dysfunction . Secondary aim : measure effect LPS administration absence presence GTS-21 human volunteer vagal nerve activity measure heart rate variability analysis . Study design : Double-blind placebo-controlled randomize cross-over intervention study healthy human volunteer experimental endotoxemia . Study population : Non-smoking healthy male volunteer , age 18-35 yr Intervention : Subjects test cross-over design 2 separate sequential session , 2-4 week apart . A total 12 subject randomly assign one two dose group 1:1 ratio : GTS-21 follow Placebo n=6 , Placebo follow GTS-21 n=6 . Subjects receive 150mg GTS-21 placebo orally tid 3 day LPS injection oral dose 150 mg GTS-21 placebo morning day LPS administration ( 07:00 AM ) . Subjects receive oral dose 150 mg GTS-21 placebo 08:00 AM another oral dose 150 mg GTS-21 placebo 1 hour LPS administration ( t=0 ) . Before LPS injection , prehydration perform infusion 1.5 L 2.5 % glucose/0.45 % saline solution 1 hour . One hour last dose GTS-21 placebo , LPS derive E coli O:113 inject ( 2 ng/kg iv 1 minute ) . There 14 day washout period patient group . The last group subject subject identical dose LPS placebo two different moment 2-4 week apart obtain time control . Main study parameters/endpoints : Main study endpoint concentration circulate cytokine LPS absence presence GTS-21 . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : A medical interview physical examination part study . Approximately 350 ml blood withdrawn urine collect . There mild discomfort associate participation study , LPS induce flu-like symptom approximately 4 hr . GTS-21 find well tolerate dose 150 mg three time daily ( 450 mg/day ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE : The innate immune response first line defense invade pathogen ( 1 ) . This tightly regulate system consist wide variety chemokines , cytokine , cell associate receptor mediator orchestrate initial response infection . Experimental evidence past several year demonstrate activation efferent vagus nerve inhibitory effect innate immune response ( cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway , review ( 2,3,4 ) ) . The anti-inflammatory effect vagal nerve mediate α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( α7nAChR ) express macrophage cytokine-producing cell ( 9 ) . Activation cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway vagus nerve stimulation α7nAChR agonists improve outcome animal model endotoxemia , sepsis experimental arthritis . This cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway efferent arm reflex mechanism activate inflammatory mediator peripheral tissue signal afferent vagus nerve . Thus , vagus nerve relay inflammation signal central nervous system activate oppose efferent response inhibit excessive inflammation . GTS-21 ( E-3- ( 2,4 ) -dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine ) highly specific α7nAchR agonist , develop treatment Alzheimer 's disease study inflammation-related model . In murine pancreatitis model pre-treatment animal GTS-21 decrease pancreatitis severity associate reduce IL-6 level decrease pancreatic neutrophil accumulation ( 11 ) . Pre-treatment mice GTS-21 attenuate systemic TNF concentration injection LPS increase survival ( 12,13 ) . Similarly , GTS-21 inhibit blood level inflammatory mediator High Mobility Group Box 1 ( HMGB1 ) improve survival mice cecal ligation puncture. ( 13 ) . Recently , show stimulation α7nAChR highly selective agonist GTS-21 lead dramatic dose-dependent inhibition pro-inflammatory cytokine release induced stimulation various Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) human whole blood ( Kox et al , submit ) . This inhibitory effect GTS-21 specific TLR-agonist use GTS-21 inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production strong nicotine equimolar concentration . Moreover , production anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 inhibit , even significantly stimulate . Therefore , stimulation α7nAChR GTS-21 result profound anti-inflammatory shift pro-/anti-inflammatory balance . So far , data available anti-inflammatory effect GTS-21 human vivo . The human endotoxemia model widely use study inflammation human vivo . Systemic inflammation induce low-dose infusion Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) healthy volunteer , result flu-like symptom , increased production C-reactive protein increase concentration pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine . The `` human endotoxemia model '' permit elucidation key player proinflammatory response human vivo serf useful tool investigate potential novel therapeutic strategy standardize set . GTS-21 develop novel agent treatment Alzheimer 's disease . Until date , 87 healthy male volunteer enrol four Phase I study assess safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , effect cognitive function oral administration GTS-21 77 subject receive GTS-21 10 subject receive placebo . GTS-21 find well tolerate dose 150 mg three time daily ( 450 mg/day ) healthy male subject . The common adverse event headache , occur 27 % subject GTS-21 group compare 21 % subject placebo group . There serious adverse event , severe adverse event report study . In one patient GTS-21 group transient mild elevation liver enzymes detect , without sign hepatic dysfunction . PRIMARY AIM : Primary aim present study investigate putative anti-inflammatory effect oral administration GTS-21 inflammatory response subsequent subclinical organ dysfunction human endotoxemia model . Secondary aim measure effect LPS administration absence presence GTS-21 human volunteer vagal nerve activity .</detailed_description>
