	<brief_summary>The purpose study look NOD2 gene child Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) parent . We hope understand NOD2 gene well determine whether child IBD NOD2 gene . In NOD2 gene , want see type gene abnormality predict nature disease genetic information help doctor decide therapy and/or treatment use patient . We also hope explore relationship know serologic marker IBD ( ASCA , pANCA , ompC ) clinical characteristic course child IBD . About 1500 child many parent possible take part study . Children newly diagnose IBD well child see Children 's Health System eligible participate study . We look child 18 year old young participate . If possible , would also like parent child participate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Markers Predictors Phenotypes Pediatric Onset Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , collectively know inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) chronic , life-long , destructive inflammatory condition gastrointestinal tract . IBD onset occur age high incidence occur late childhood , adolescence young adulthood . The incidence IBD child adolescents significantly increase last 40 year . The precise factor underlie IBD pathogenesis yet define may involve persistent bacterial infection , defective mucosal barrier , imbalance regulation immune response . Epidemiologic study adult population identify significant genetic contribution etiology CD , simple Mendelian model IBD inheritance support segregation analysis . Taken together , observation support complex immunogenetic model IBD whereby genetically susceptible individual harbor aberrant response yet-unidentified environmental influence . Attempts localize IBD susceptibility gene genome-wide linkage study identify putative locus chromosome 16 . Recently 3 group investigator show sequence variation within NOD2 gene ( MIM 605956 ) chromosome 16q12 strongly associate susceptibility CD . Attempts link NOD2 mutation disease phenotype recently identify association ileal specific-disease patient NOD2/ CARD 15 mutation . This initial association genotype phenotype suggest genetic factor influence disease location . At time frequency NOD2 gene mutation population base sample , specifically cohort newly diagnose patient know . In addition , attempt correlate genotype CD phenotype perform adult , data generate child . Identification mutation child particular interest , presentation initial disease manifest disease `` pure '' form , long duration chronic inflammation typically see adult patient exert influence disease phenotype ( i.e . stricture formation secondary longstanding , poorly control inflammation ) . Thus , genotype/phenotype correlation child prospective fashion function characterize NOD2/ CARD15 mutation general population , also begin evaluation disease progression prediction disease severity behaviour time , start point time diagnosis . This obvious clinical therapeutic implication , begin process link disease genotype optimal therapy . Therefore , central hypothesis : Identification NOD2/ CARD 15 mutation newly diagnose CD child predict disease location , disease behaviour identify optimal approach therapy . This test follow three Specific Aims . 1 . Genotype cohort WI IBD child 4 NOD2 / CARD 15 mutation . 2 . Statistical analysis phenotype genotype correlation cohort WI pediatric IBD alliance child without family history IBD . The Wisconsin pediatric IBD alliance form January 2000 track new diagnosis IBD occur child young age 18 . This clinical consortium successfully recruit 100 % pediatric GI specialist within Wisconsin prospectively record new IBD diagnosis , order obtain population base incidence CD UC within U.S . Between 1/1/00 12/31/01 , identify 192 new case IBD within state . Sixty-five percent child Southeast Wisconsin , diagnose Children 's Hospital Wisconsin . In addition newly diagnose child , cohort 294 additional pediatric IBD child follow Children 's Hospital Wisconsin serve reference population . The focus proposal correlate genetic influence clinical disease course behavior use molecular classification pediatric CD child population base pediatric cohort . This DDC grant allow PI co-investigator generate sufficient preliminary data under-researched area pediatric CD continue investigation support national foundation ( CCFA ) /or NIH .</detailed_description>
