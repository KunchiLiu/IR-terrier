	<brief_summary>Despite significant advance understand brain tumor biology genetics well improvement surgical technique , radiotherapy administration , chemotherapy method , many primary brain tumor remain incurable . Most primary brain tumor highly infiltrative neoplasm , therefore unlikely cure local treatment surgery , focal radiotherapy , radiosurgery brachytherapy . A particularly problematic aspect management patient brain tumor eventual development enhance lesion MRI radiation therapy . The treat physician leave dilemma enhance lesion may represent ( radiation necrosis versus recurrent tumor ) . The differential diagnosis recurrent tumor radiation necrosis however amount contribute enhance mass MRI difficult impossible ass . This particular problem common patient develop degree radiation necrosis therapy radiation . Differentiation necrosis recurrence particularly challenge . MRI typically unable make important distinction simply enhance mass , etiology could either necrosis recurrence . Other image method FDG-PET use technique also complicate normal brain FDG uptake often difficult differentiate recurrence necrosis . [ F-18 ] FLT may prove reliable method make important differentiation ( necrosis versus recurrence ) normal brain necrotic brain proliferative activity thus [ F-18 ] FLT uptake whereas tumor proliferative activity thus [ F-18 ] FLT uptake .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>F-18 Fluorothymidine ( FLT ) Imaging Patients With Primary Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study assess preliminary efficacy radiopharmaceutical 3'-deoxy-3'- [ F-18 ] fluorothymidine , [ F-18 ] FLT , radiopharmaceutical directly assess tumor proliferation use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) differentiate tumor recurrence radiation necrosis group 30 patient glial neoplasms . This preliminary clinical study investigate [ F-18 ] FLT patient previously treat primary malignant brain tumor ( WHO Grade II , III IV glial-based tumor ) new enlarge enhance lesion Gd-MRI possible differentiate recurrent tumor radiation necrosis basis conventional imaging technique . The ability make important differentiation accurately determine amount/degree tumor recurrence amount/degree radiation necrosis enhance mass critical care treat brain tumor patient could potentially change patient management validate accurate mean differentiate amount/degree radiation necrosis recurrence . While safety [ F-18 ] FLT study many patient date also obtain additional safety data use agent patient primary brain tumor cohort initial 12 patient study . It important emphasize potential clinical application [ F-18 ] FLT image brain tumor must compare current widely use image technique MRI PET image use agent , [ F-18 ] fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) . In study , [ F-18 ] FLT PET use assess three goal project : 1 . Show imaging [ F-18 ] FLT PET good determine amount/degree tumor versus necrosis abnormal area see recent MRI scan FDG-PET scan . 2 . The [ F-18 ] FLT radiopharmaceutical show safe safe amount administer study . 3 . The amount [ F-18 ] FLT see PET study show correlate correlate test use determine proliferation brain tumor tissue sample newly identify abnormality MRI event another surgical biopsy procedure perform</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient ( n = 20 ) primary brain tumor study . All patient previous radiation may may chemotherapy treatment primary brain tumor . All patient must either radiological establish histological diagnosis follow general category : glioma ( grade 2 grade 4 ) previously treat radiation therapy possibly chemotherapy . It expect patient may need biopsy neurosurgical procedure diagnostic and/or therapeutic purpose necessary treatment disease . In instance pathologic result use correlation image finding . Only clinically indicate biopsy and/or surgery do surgery incidental inclusion protocol . Patients must 18 year old inclusion study . After entry study , initial 12 patient expect follow least 1 month infusion [ F18 ] FLT . The patient , female , must postmenopausal minimum one year surgically sterile , one follow method birth control minimum one month prior entry study : IUD , oral contraceptive , DepoProvera Norplant . These criterion waive discretion investigator patient 's intracranial tumor consider life threaten one month wait require best interest patient . Negative pregnancy test accept . Pretreatment laboratory test patient receive [ F18 ] FLT must perform within 14 day prior study entry . These must great less 4X normal upper low limit . These include liver enzyme ( SGOT , SGPT , ALK Phos , GGT , LDH ) , bilirubin ( direct total ) , amylase , serum electrolyte , CBC platelets absolute neutrophil count , prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , BUN , creatinine , urinalysis . Pretreatment radiological scans/studies ( Gd enhance MRI FDGPET ) patient receive [ F18 ] FLT must perform within 10 day study entry . Patients clinically significant sign uncal herniation , acute pupillary enlargement , rapidly develop motor change ( hour ) , rapidly decrease level consciousness , eligible . Patients know allergic hypersensitivity reaction previously administer radiopharmaceutical . Patients significant drug allergy autoimmune disease may enrol Investigator 's discretion . Patients pregnant lactate suspect might pregnant . Adult patient require monitored anesthesia PET scanning . HIV positive patient due previous toxicity note FLT patient group .</criteria>
