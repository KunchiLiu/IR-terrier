	<detailed_description>Pertussis , `` whooping cough '' , cause gram negative pleomorphic bacillus , Bordetella pertussis , highly contagious , potentially life-threatening respiratory illness re-emerged United States ( US ) cause morbidity mortality infant less 6 month age well morbidity adolescent adult . Tetanus toxoid , reduce diphtheria toxoid acellular pertussis vaccine adsorb ( Tdap ) immunization woman third trim pregnancy represent opportunity protect vulnerable young infant passively acquire maternal pertussis specific antibody . Tdap vaccine evaluate purpose since monovalent acellular pertussis ( aP ) vaccine available U.S . This multi-site , randomize , double mask , cross-over study 48 healthy pregnant woman , 18-45 year age randomize ( 2:1 ) two group . One group receive single dose Tdap vaccine 30-32 week gestation postpartum dose saline . The group receive saline 30-32 week gestation postpartum dose Tdap vaccine . On May 30 , 2008 Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) issue recommendation use Tdap pregnant postpartum woman : `` Pregnant woman ( include woman breastfeed ) receive dose Tdap previously receive Tdap delivery discharge hospital birthing center 2 year elapse since recent administration Td . '' This study design provide control evaluation safety Tdap vaccine administer pregnancy provide compliance ACIP recommendation . Immune responses Tdap vaccine measure antepartum postpartum woman enrol clinical trial compare . Also , immune response 32 pregnant woman antenatally immunized Tdap compare approximately 32 healthy non-pregnant woman contemporaneously enrol 2 age group ( 18-39 year 40-45 year ) equal pregnant woman . The purpose study evaluate safety Tdap vaccine pregnant woman neonate effect maternal immunization infant immune response DTaP vaccination . The safety immune response Tdap vaccine 32 pregnant woman immunize antenatally compare approximately 32 non-pregnant woman enrol contemporaneously . The primary objective phase I study : evaluate safety single 0.5 mL intramuscular injection Tdap vaccine healthy pregnant woman vaccinate 30-32 week gestation compare woman immunize postpartum non-pregnant control group ; evaluate safety maternal Tdap immunization neonate . Secondary objective : ass immunogenicity Tdap vaccine healthy pregnant woman compare woman immunize postpartum non-pregnant control group ; determine efficiency placental transport maternal pertussis specific antibody neonate ; assess persistence maternal pertussis specific antibodies infant prior receive first dose DTaP [ Diphtheria Tetanus Toxoids Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed , Inactivated Poliovirus Haemophilus b Conjugate ( Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate ] vaccine infant ) ; assess effect maternal immunization Tdap vaccine infant immune response DTaP vaccination . Study duration approximately 3 year . Subject participation approximately 15 month ( mother-infant pair ) 7 month non-pregnan</detailed_description>
