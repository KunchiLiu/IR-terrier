	<brief_title>Trial Induction Therapy With Docetaxel , Cisplatin Fluorouracil Previously Untreated Patients With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma and/or Poorly Differentiated Carcinoma Nasal Cavity and/or Paranasal Sinuses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Docetaxel design stop growth cancer cell , may cause cell die . It believe weakly effective kill blood vessel cancer cell well . Cisplatin atom center contain platinum . The platinum suppose poison cancer cell , may cause die . Carboplatin design interfere growth cancer cell stop cell division , may cause cell die . 5-Fluorouracil design destroy cancer cell prevent divide multiplying . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive 5-fluorouracil needle vein , non-stop , Days 1-4 21-day study `` cycle '' . On Day 1 , receive docetaxel 1 hour cisplatin 30-180 minute . You receive 2-3 cycle therapy . If study doctor think best interest , may receive carboplatin place cisplatin . If side effect , study doctor may schedule receive study drug longer cycle . Study Visits : During Weeks 1-3 Cycles 1 2 , study visit week receive chemotherapy treatment . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Your medical history record , include measurement height weight . - Your doctor ask side effect may experience . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your skin inside mouth examine doctor . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) . - You hear test . Once Cycle 2 complete , follow test procedure perform learn disease respond therapy : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your medical history record , include measurement height weight . - You nasal endoscopy . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . - Your doctor ask side effect may experience . - Your performance status check . - The nerve function head neck check hand . - If doctor think necessary , chest x-ray . - If doctor think necessary , bone scan . - If liver test abnormal doctor think necessary , CT scan abdomen . - If doctor think necessary , positron emission tomography ( PET ) PET-CT. - You eye exam . Chemotherapy Radiotherapy : Based result test procedure perform check see disease respond , doctor decide next treatment . If respond partly completely , receive 3rd cycle chemotherapy . You follow schedule first 2 cycle . Once complete 3 cycle chemotherapy , begin chemoradiation . Your doctor discus detail receive separate consent form . If disease respond partly completely , surgery follow radiotherapy . Before surgery , ask sign separate inform consent . Risks discuss treat doctor depend type surgery . Before radiotherapy , ask sign separate inform consent describe possible risk . Additional Cycles : If disease respond partly completely , receive additional ( third ) cycle therapy . If additional cycle , follow schedule Cycles 1 2 . Before receive additional cycle , hear test . Study Visit After Chemoradiation : If receive chemoradiation , last chemotherapy treatment follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your medical history record , include measurement height weight . - The nerve function head neck check hand . - You nasal endoscopy . - You MRI . - Your doctor ask side effect may experience . - If doctor think necessary , also CT positron emission tomography ( PET ) -CT scan . Length Study : You remain study treatment 16-20 week . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Follow-up/End-of-Treatment Visits : If disease respond completely study , follow-up visit every 3 month Years 1-2 , every 4 month Year 3 , every 6 month Years 4-5 . If disease respond completely side effect end-of-study visit , follow-up visit every 4 week side effect go away . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your complete medical history record , include measurement height weight . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You nasal endoscopy . - The nerve function head neck check . - Your doctor ask side effect may experience . - Your performance status check . - One ( 1 ) time year , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw thyroid function test . If disease respond completely study , additional test procedure also perform 6 month Year 1 , yearly Years 1-3 . The following test also perform : - You eye exam . - You hear test . - You dental exam . - You complete questionnaire ask rate symptom much may interfere daily activity . This take 10 minute complete . - You saliva flow test . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . - If doctor think necessary , chest x-ray . - If doctor think necessary , bone scan . - If liver test abnormal doctor think necessary , CT scan abdomen . - If doctor think necessary , positron emission tomography ( PET ) PET-CT. Additional information : At time study , MRI doctor think necessary . This investigational study . Docetaxel FDA approve treatment certain type breast cancer , gastric cancer , prostate cancer , advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Cisplatin FDA approve use together drug treat advance ovarian cancer , testicular cancer , locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck , late-stage cervical cancer , non-small cell lung cancer . Carboplatin FDA-approved commercially available treatment ovarian , lung , head neck cancer . 5-fluorouracil FDA approve use drug treat metastatic colorectal cancer , locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck , gastric adenocarcinoma . The use drug treat cancer nasal cavity paranasal sinuses investigational . Up 45 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must confirm ( MDACC pathologist ) cytologic histological diagnosis locally advance squamous cell carcinoma , poorly differentiate carcinoma , sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma nasal cavity and/or paranasal sinuses . 2 . 2 . Stage IIIV disease ; T 24 , N , M0 . Measurable disease require follow criterion : Measurable lesion accurately measure , least one diameter &gt; \= 1.0 cm spiral CT scan MRI . Lesions bidimensionally measurable unidimensionally measurable . Every effort make measure lesion two dimension . Measurable disease present patient one measurable lesion . Nonmeasurable lesions/disease lesion , include small lesion ( measurement &lt; 2.0 cm ; &lt; 1.0 cm spiral CT ) . 3 . ECOG PS 01 . 4 . Age &gt; 16 year . 5 . Patients adequate bone marrow function define absolute peripheral granulocyte count ( AGC ) &gt; /= 1500 cells/mm3 platelet count &gt; /= 100,000 cells/mm3 ; 6 .
