	<brief_title>A Randomized , Self Controlled Clinical Study Hemostatic Efficacy HemCon Dental Dressing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HemCon® Bandage successfully use achieve hemostasis patient high systolic pressure , high blood volume wound , promote hemostasis massive scale compare hemostasis requirement oral surgery wound . Therefore , human clinical trial recently complete evaluate efficacy use HemCon® Bandage small finish size dental extraction oral surgery site . The HemCon® Bandage proven significantly well promote hemostasis oral surgery wound control ( cotton gauze Gelfoam ) subject test . All HemCon® Bandage sit achieve hemostasis faster control sit . Based data , 510 ( k ) submit received FDA clearance HemCon® Dental Dressing use oral wound dress intended physical barrier temporary protection oral mucosal tissue provide pain relief . This study evaluate FDA clear HemCon® Dental Dressing use hemostasis soft oral tissue subsequent dental surgical procedure tooth extraction exclude procedure involve primary closure HemCon® Dental Dressing within oral wound .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients require 2 4 3rd molar tooth extraction procedure . Index pair must reflect anatomically similar extraction location , i.e. , 2 extraction must upper must lower extraction . Patients must 14 year age old Patients must available minimum one post operative evaluation schedule time procedure approximately 7 day post surgery . Additional followup visit may schedule discretion surgeon base severity particular patient case patient 's need earlier followup . Extraction sit require primary closure suture Willingness ability provide inform consent/ assent participation Patients seafood allergy Patients discontinue use anticoagulant medication ( e.g. , aspirin , coumadin , Plavix , etc . ) minimum 3 day prior plan surgical visit . Scheduled undergo surgical procedure 3rd molar tooth extraction Scheduled undergo 2 extraction whereby one upper 3rd molar low 3rd molar . These reflect proper index pair statistical calculation data analysis base anatomical similarity . Extraction procedure expect require primary closure suture HemCon® Dental Dressing within oral wound . Unable unwilling provide inform consent/ assent participation subject Patients currently take anticoagulant medication ( e.g. , aspirin , coumadin , Plavix , etc . ) discontinue anticoagulant medication less 3 day prior surgical visit . Patients undergo bisphosphonate therapy .</criteria>
