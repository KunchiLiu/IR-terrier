	<brief_title>rhBMP-2/CRM/CD HORIZON® Spinal System Pivotal Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial conduct evaluate rhBMP-2/CRM/CD HORIZON® Spinal System posterolateral fusion treatment patient symptomatic degenerative disc disease versus control group autogenous bone CD HORIZON® Spinal System . The investigational treatment open bilateral posterolateral implantation rhBMP-2/CRM/CD HORIZON® Spinal System . One investigational implant place across two adjacent transverse process side spine spinal fusion procedure . The control treatment bilateral posterolateral implantation autogenous bone harvest iliac crest CD HORIZON® Spinal System .</detailed_description>
