	<detailed_description>What significance project ? The significance two fold : ( 1 ) serious nature clinical condition address , ( 2 ) potential ease safety approach could translate clinical practice . Although many advance treatment modality relate febrile neutropenia , still remain common complication cancer therapy account majority chemotherapy-associated death ( Sipsas 2005 ) . The broad-spectrum therapeutic management febrile neutropenia often `` shotgun '' approach , without clear source allow target-specific therapy . The subpopulation patient febrile neutropenia present great problem persistent febrile neutropenia &gt; 5 day despite broad spectrum antibiotic , without identifiable source infection . As noted previously , however , definition persistence change medical practice . Currently medical professional order diagnostic imaging study CT scan earlier due need localize site infection use appropriate antibiotic therapy . Without target , multi-drug antibiotic therapy patient continue many week . The drug often toxic , substantial side effect . Hospitalization extend . The cost broad spectrum hospital course antibacterial antifungal drug range multiple $ 10,000 , cost extend hospitalization treat unknown infection patient persistent febrile neutropenia may multiples $ 100,000 . Chemotherapy may suspend discontinued , risk development chemo-resistant tumor cell . Conventional image method limited evaluation febrile neutropenia due lack anatomic change . The lack sufficient white cell mount inflammatory reaction compromise detection sit infection radiography CT. Because white cell number severely reduce , use label white cell scan often preclude . If FDG-PET/CT provide likely anatomic site target antibiotic therapy specific high risk population , possible morbidity/mortality infection antibiotic side effect may minimize , hospitalization day may reduce , effective anti-cancer therapy may continue without interruption . Although FDG-PET/CT cheap , ultimate result may highly cost-effective . Our oncologist infectious disease co-investigators predict tissue diagnosis obtain least 80 % FDG-PET/CT CT finding suspicious infection child 50 % adult . This confirmatory tissue diagnosis serve `` gold standard '' assess effectiveness FDG-PET/CT finding source infection . Additional confirmatory factor include clinical response target therapy resolution associate radiographic CT finding . The data evaluate address follow question , sub-aims fund proposal : 1 . How effective FDG-PET/CT identifying site infection patient febrile neutropenia without obvious cause ? 2 . To degree FDG-PET/CT improve detection site infection CT alone ? 3 . What FDG-PET/CT image variable best predict presence infection specific site ( e.g . standardize uptake value [ SUV ] , concomitant abnormality CT ) ? 4 . Can magnitude uptake FDG measure SUV site infection predict identity infective agent ( bacterial vs. fungal vs. viral ) ? 5 . Does magnitude uptake site infection correlate absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ? 6 . Can clinical score system develop identify population patient FDG-PET/CT likely efficacious identify site infection ? This pilot data use determine whether sufficient support , aid design , large , prospective , multi-center clinical trial establish cost-effectiveness efficacy FDG-PET/CT evaluation febrile neutropenia , compare patient manage conventional method .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pediatric patient : All pediatric subject recruit Intermountain Primary Children 's Medical Center ( PCMC ) . At point time , 610 inpatient PCMC treat inpatient febrile neutropenia . Each day , 23 new patient febrile neutropenia admit transfer PCMC hospital clinic across intermountain area . Approximately 35 patient per week eligible inclusion study ( highrisk persistent febrile neutropenia without obvious cause ) . The target study recruit minimum 12 pediatric patient per month protocol . Therefore , eligible pediatric patient population sufficient meet goal . Most patient &gt; 10 year age . The vast majority adolescent teenager , pediatric patient high risk febrile neutropenia high dose methotrexate high risk leukemia lymphomas target adolescent teenager . Leukemics constitute large percentage patient . To eligible inclusion , subject must admit treatment inpatient febrile neutropenia , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 500 cells/mm3 , fever persists without obvious source despite 5 day broad spectrum antibiotic . Typically , pediatric patient category treat IV Fortaz ( ceftazidime ) . We also study patient meet old definition persistent ( &gt; 5 day ) fever medical reason advance image study ( typically CT scan ) medically indicate localization possible site infection . These patient fever neutropenic , however may febrile &gt; 5 day . Medical image indicated sooner typical 5 day due patient condition need localize site infection . Exclusion criterion include inability undergo FDGPET/CT scan without conscious sedation , medical instability would preclude safe transport PET center Huntsman Cancer Hospital ( PCMC PET scanner ) , fast serum glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl . A negative pregnancy test require postmenarche female prior inclusion . Adult patient : All adult subject recruit Huntsman Cancer Hospital , patient recruit general oncology service . As pediatric patient , consider eligible include document fever &gt; 5 day despite IV antibiotic , ANC &lt; 500 cells/mm3 , patient treatment high risk patient . We also study patient meet old definition persistent ( &gt; 5 day ) fever medical reason advance image study ( typically CT scan ) medically indicate localization possible site infection . These patient fever neutropenic , however may febrile &gt; 5 day . Medical image indicated sooner typical 5 day due patient condition need localize site infection . On average , 56 patient per week admit Huntsman Cancer Hospital diagnosis high risk persistent febrile neutropenia . At one time , typically 34 adult patient ward diagnosis persistent febrile neutropenia . Of , approximately 23 patient per week eligible inclusion study ( persistent febrile neutropenia without obvious cause ) . The target study recruit minimum 12 adult patient per month protocol . Therefore , eligible adult patient population sufficient meet goal . As pediatric population , majority patient leukemia lymphoma ( 50:50 ) . Adult patient may also multiple myeloma . In patient , typical duration neutropenia 34 week . Typically , initial workup adult patient febrile neutropenia chest Xray , CBC , urinalysis , peripheral central line blood culture , additional study direct symptom . Initial inpatient treatment high risk patient typically IV meropenem ceftazidime . If fever persist beyond 5 day without specific localize sign symptom , antibacterial may change add , antifungal start ( typically amphotericin B caspofungin ) , typically persist white count return 1000 cell/mm3 . Additional imaging study do consistent basis adult persistent highrisk febrile neutropenia . Extended image typically do symptom dictate . Typically , source infection find 4050 % patient febrile neutropenia institution well literature ( Chaimberlain 2005 ; Hughes 2002 ; Roguin 1996 ) . In persistent febrile neutropenia patient despite comprehensive evaluation assessment source identify additional 10 % patient . As pediatric patient , adult exclusion criterion include inability undergo FDGPET/CT without conscious sedation , medical instability , fast serum glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl , pregnancy . A negative pregnancy test require female reproductive potential prior inclusion . Of note , patient bone marrow transplant unit eligible participate pilot study , . Many patient place prophylactic antifungal agent time presentation neutropenia fever . This may cause druginduced fever certain percentage recipient . For reason , clinical picture cloud however patient may still occult infection . Bone marrow transplant patient include study exploratory study information gain assess ability FDGPET/CT localize site infection neutropenic , febrile bone marrow transplant patient valuable .</criteria>
