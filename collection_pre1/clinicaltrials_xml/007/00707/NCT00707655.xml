	<brief_title>Zalutumumab Combination With Radiotherapy Head Neck Cancer Patients Ineligible Platinum Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , multi-center , phase I/II dose-escalation clinical trial investigate safety zalutumumab combination radiotherapy . The safety zalutumumab dose combination radiotherapy ( RT ) investigate use 3 patient cohort dose-escalation / de-escalation design base Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) . The dose-escalation start 8 mg/kg zalutumumab combination RT . Initially , three patient treat dose level observe DLTs . If none three patient experience DLT , next cohort three patient treat next high dose zalutumumab . If one three patient treat dose level experience DLT , three patient treat dose level . If two three patient experience DLTs , next cohort three patient treat next low dose zalutumumab , unless least six patient dose already dose . Furthermore , 1 few DLTs observe among six patient give dose level , next cohort three patient treat next high dose zalutumumab . The maximum tolerate dose decide Genmab base recommendation make IDMC basis review aggregate safety data .</detailed_description>
