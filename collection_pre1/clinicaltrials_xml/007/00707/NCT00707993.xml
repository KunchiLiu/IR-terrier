	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Alogliptin Compared Glipizide Elderly Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes among common chronic condition adult 65 year age older . A recent National Health Nutrition Examination Survey report 20 % adult age 65 year old diabetes . These individual often under-treated respect glucose-lowering medication , care complicate extent clinical functional status . Age-related change physiology , diabetes-associated illness illness ( renal , cardiac , hepatic insufficiency ) , well use multiple medication make standard oral anti-hyperglycemic therapy insulin use problematic . In addition , hypoglycemia common severe old rather young patient take oral antidiabetic drug precipitate serious event fall hip fracture . While avoidance hypoglycemia paramount elderly diabetic patient , many commonly used medication associate substantial risk hypoglycemia . New class drug avoid complication elderly population increase interest population continue expand . Takeda develop SYR-322 ( alogliptin ) improvement glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . Alogliptin inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme . Dipeptidyl peptidase IV think primarily responsible degradation 2 peptide hormone release response nutrient ingestion . It expect inhibition dipeptidyl peptidase IV improve glycemic ( glucose ) control patient type 2 diabetes . This study compare effectiveness safety alogliptin glipizide ( commonly use diabetes medication ) adults 65 90 year age Type 2 diabetes . Individuals participate study either fail diet exercise therapy alone 2 month Screening , receive single oral antidiabetic medication without obtain good blood glucose ( sugar ) control . Each participant require commit screen visit . Study participation anticipate 59 week .</detailed_description>
