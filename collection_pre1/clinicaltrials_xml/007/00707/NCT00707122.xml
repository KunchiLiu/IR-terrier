	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND The association mortality hypoalbuminemia observe several disease . Nonetheless , efficacy albumin survival critically ill patient controversial . Several meta-analyses report either negative , neutral , beneficial effect albumin administration . To clarify controversy , large multicenter prospective study perform , compare effect 4 % albumin vs. saline volume replacement critically ill patient . Although difference overall mortality observe , predefined subgroup analysis show trend longer survival septic patient treat albumin . As fluid replacement show critical sepsis , base primary ( oncotic ) secondary property ( anti-inflammatory ) , conceivable use albumin volume replacement treat hypoalbuminemia may beneficial effect survival septic patient . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : verify whether volume replacement albumin ( treat group ) maintenance within plasmatic physiologic range ( equal 30 g/l ) improve survival patient severe sepsis septic shock , compare crystalloids ( control group ) . Secondary objective : verify difference organ dysfunction , hospital intensive care unit ( ICU ) length stay treat control group . METHODS About 1350 patient severe sepsis septic shock randomize receive either albumin crystalloids fluid therapy . Volume replacement perform group accord early-goal direct therapy . Treated group receive 60 gr albumin infusion randomization , 40-60 gr albumin daily infusion maintain serum album level equal 30 g/l . Control group receive crystalloids entire study ; albumin administration allow daily serum albumin level lower 15 g/l . Patients treat 28th day randomization ICU discharge , whichever come first . EXPECTED RESULTS Primary outcome : absolute risk reduction overall mortality 7.5 % 28th day , control 90th day , follow randomization . Secondary outcome : reduction number severity organ dysfunction ( assess Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ) , reduction ICU hospital length stay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE The association mortality hypoalbuminemia document several disease , include liver cirrhosis , nephrosic syndrome , others . Being responsible 80 % oncotic power plasma protein human , albumin key factor regulate fluid exchange interstitial intravascular space , thereby extensively affect hemodynamics . Besides oncotic property , albumin present characteristic potentially important critically ill patient : 1 - binding capacity several physiological molecule drug , 2 - scavenge action oxygen free radical , 3 - modulating activity nitric oxide ( NO ) metabolism , 4 - buffer power acid-base equilibrium . Regardless theoretical usefulness , efficacy albumin administration survival critically ill patient controversial . The critical review publish Cochrane Albumin Reviewers 1998 , include 30 clinical study , show increased mortality critically ill patient treat albumin . A meta-analysis performed 2001 , include 55 clinical trial , conclude albumin administration safe although effect survival . In recent meta-analysis , include 90 cohort study , , separately , 9 prospective control trial correct albumin level , hypoalbuminemia show negative prognostic factor term mortality , morbidity length stay , dose-dependent effect . In particular , 10-g/l decline plasmatic albumin level observe significantly increase odds mortality 137 % . Moreover , analysis perform within 9 controlled trial suggest complication rate may reduce plasmatic albumin concentration maintain 30 g/l . To clarify controversial finding , multicenter double-blinded randomize prospective study perform 7000 critically ill patient , compare effect 4 % albumin vs. saline infusion volume replacement . Although difference overall mortality observe , predefined subgroup analysis show trend improvement survival patient treat albumin affect severe sepsis ( p=0.09 ) . In contrast , trend towards bad outcome patient treat albumin observe subgroup patient trauma ( p=0.06 ) , likely due high number patient trauma associate brain injury survive albumin-treated group . These finding , therefore , highlight importance characterize different type critically ill patient may benefit albumin administration . More recently , prospective , randomize control study show , series 100 patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) , significant reduction organ dysfunction , detect Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score , correction hypoalbuminemia albumin administration . In parallel investigation role albumin critically ill patient , increase interest focus time hemodynamic target volume replacement septic patient . In particular , recent randomize control study perform patient sepsis show well survival group patient fluid replacement obtain early possible accord predefined hemodynamic target ( `` early goal-directed therapy '' ) , compare control group . Focusing attention septic patient , , therefore , conclude : - early-goal directed volume replacement improve survival , , b - `` type '' volume replacement may effect survival . In fact , volume replacement use saline require great amount fluid may lead metabolic acidosis . On hand , volume replacement use hydroxyethyl starch potentially harmful . Volume replacement use albumin involve know risk may also beneficial septic patient . The current study aim verify whether volume replacement use albumin maintenance within plasmatic physiologic range may beneficial effect term mortality , morbidity length stay patient severe sepsis septic shock , compare standard volume replacement use crystalloids . For purpose , overcome possible bias explain , study design include two different important aspect : 1 - arm study population , i.e. , patient treat albumin crystalloids , volume replacement perform accord `` early-goal directed therapy '' ; 2 - volume replacement , follow day treatment 28th day admission ICU ( day ICU discharge , whichever come first ) , serum albumin level monitor kept equal level 30 g/l albumin treat group . Such study design several advantage . In particular , introduction `` early-goal directed therapy '' patient treat albumin crystalloids , use pre-defined hemodynamic target , standardize optimize volume replacement septic patient accord standard care moment suggest worldwide . Moreover , allow u specifically observe direct effect albumin administration per se maintenance serum level within normal range . In fact , besides oncotic property , conceivable physiological characteristic albumin potentially important septic patient ( NO modulation , free oxygen radical scavenging , acid-base homeostasis ) may possible benefit survival , especially early resuscitation phase . Under perspective , attempt elucidate possible mechanism use albumin volume replacement may beneficial patient sepsis , plan create centralize blood bank include blood sample sequentially withdraw patient include study population evaluate effect albumin biological marker . Albumin , fact , may important effect reduce overall systemic inflammation ongoing septic patient , thereby explain possible direct benefit administration . For purpose , plan involve sub-group 50 participate ICUs enrol 700 patient , three serum sample withdraw ( day 1 , day 2 day 7 enrollment ) store bank . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To verify hypothesis volume replacement albumin maintenance within predefined plasmatic physiologic range ( equal great 30 g/l ) improve survival patient severe sepsis septic shock , compare volume replacement use crystalloids . Survival measure 28th 90th day enrollment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To verify hypothesis volume replacement albumin maintenance within predefined plasmatic physiologic range ( equal great 30 g/l ) reduce : 1 . The number severity organ dysfunction , detect SOFA score 2 . The hospital length stay 3 . ICU length stay SUB-STUDY To understand possible mechanism albumin administration maintenance serum level equal 30 g/l might potentially beneficial , compare crystalloids , patient severe sepsis septic shock , particular regard inflammatory process characterize category patient . For purpose , create blood bank sequential plasmatic sample patient include study , aim detect possible difference plasmatic level biologic marker systemic inflammation .
