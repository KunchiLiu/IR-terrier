	<brief_summary>This study design randomize , prospective study test efficacy imiquimod plus tazarotene treatment LM . Eligible consent patient randomize one two treatment group : 1 ) topical imiquimod group , 2 ) topical imiquimod combine topical tazarotene group . All patient undergo staged surgical excision rush permanent section confirm negative histologic margin . This follow surgical repair defect long-term follow-up five year rule recurrence . Both group polygonal excision use 2mm margin per stage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives The objective study : 1. reduce surgical morbidity stag excision often require multiple stage surgery order verify negative histologic margin 2. investigate addition topical retinoid , standard-of-care ( topical imiquimod staged-excision ) evaluate improvement efficacy 3. see treatment surround normal appear skin combination topical agent reduce recurrence rate compare staged-excision . Our hypothesis combination topical agent well treat subclinical melanocytic atypia give rise recurrence . Primary endpoint : The primary goal comparison number stage require negative histologic margin imiquimod plus tazarotene group compare imiquimod group . Tumors require 5 stage combine one category data analysis . The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test use statistical comparison . Secondary endpoint : 1 . Comparison surgical defect size ( mm2 ) study group . The difference area entire surgical defect original tumor ( record transparent plastic ) calculate patient use endpoint . 2 . Comparison skin inflammation study group . Skin inflammation record ordered categorical variable four category ( 0-3 ) describe Section 5 . 3 . The type surgical repair require ( i.e . primary repair , skin flap , skin graft ) . 4 . Immunostaining evaluate inflammatory infiltrate . Immunostaining analyzed ordered categorical variable . 5 . Recurrence tumor 3 month , 6 month , 12 month , yearly next four year . 6 . The proportion patient skin ulceration . 7 . The relationship ulceration , skin inflammation clearance LM . Study Procedures A total eighty patient , twelve-month period , recruit one center open label study . Forty patient randomly assign one two treatment group mention Study Design section . The study consist 4 phase : ( 1 ) Enrollment screen period evaluate skin cancer , measure trace perimeter ; ( 2 ) 12 week treatment topical application study drug ( ) ; ( 3 ) Surgical excision treatment site ensure eradication tumor ; ( 4 ) Follow-up period rule recurrence . All patient must biopsy-proven diagnosis lentigo maligna confirm least two dermatopathologists Department Dermatology University Utah School Medicine . At initial examination clinical border lesion define use Wood 's lamp ( 360nm ) perimeter outline gentian violet marker photograph medical record . ( Wood 's lamp examination help identify pigmentary alteration skin sometimes difficult appreciate normal lighting condition . ) At time enrollment , rule invasive melanoma , potential study participant undergo shave biopsy lesion use local anesthesia . Enrollment occur biopsy examine confirm lentigo maligna ( melanoma in-situ ) . If invasive melanoma find , patient exclude study additional evaluation/therapies implement . If patient enrol study , piece biopsy specimen use perform immunohistochemistry evaluate inflammatory infiltrate . A similar series histochemical stain perform conclusion study use piece excise skin . Topical imiquimod group : Patients randomize group perimeter LM site , define Wood 's lamp examination , drawn skin gentian violet pen photograph Polaroid camera . One photograph go medical record second give patient help identify propose treatment area . The gentian violet perimeter copy transparent plastic facilitate tumor localization since tumor predict disappear clinically treatment . The patient treat LM site two centimeter beyond perimeter margin topical imiquimod 5 % cream Monday thru Friday week total twelve week . After three month topical treatment , one-month wash period observe allow resolution inflammation obscure pathologist 's ability evaluate excise tumor/treatment site . A staged excision perform two millimeter margin around original tumor perimeter previously record transparent plastic place patient 's skin outline perimeter accurately . Once negative margin confirm histologically , post-operative defect size measure mm2 plastic surgical repair perform optimize cosmesis . Topical imiquimod topical tazarotene 0.1 % cream group : Patients randomize group undergo identical treatment protocol topical imiquimod group addition topical tazarotene 0.1 % cream Saturday Sunday week .</detailed_description>
