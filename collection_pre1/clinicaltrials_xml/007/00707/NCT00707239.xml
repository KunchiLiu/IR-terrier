	<brief_summary>This study compare safety efficacy tigecycline regimen versus imipenem/cilastatin regimen treatment subject hospitalize hospital-acquired pneumonia ( HAP ) . At least 70 % enrolled subject ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) . Two dose level tigecycline assess compare imipenem/cilastatin parallel . Subjects receive intravenous therapy minimum 7 &amp; 14 consecutive day , exact duration decision investigator base subject 's condition . Additional protocol specify antibiotic may give ensure appropriate coverage . A final assessment test-of-cure ( TOC ) visit do 10 21 day last day therapy . The total duration subject participation 17 44 day , include follow period 30 day last day therapy SAEs . Subjects follow safety efficacy . The safety assessment include : physical examination , vital sign , assessment clinical sign symptom pneumonia , collection adverse event , 12-lead ECG , collection sample hematology , serum chemistry , coagulation parameter , &amp; serum urine pregnancy test study entry woman childbearing potential . The clinical microbiological efficacy evaluate .</brief_summary>
