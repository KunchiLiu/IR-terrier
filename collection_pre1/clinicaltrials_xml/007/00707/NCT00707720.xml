	<brief_title>Multi-Center Feasibility Study Trans-oral Endoscopic Restrictive Implant System ( TERIS ) Treatment Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity consider epidemic industrialized world . The consequence obesity long-term health individual well document . While lifestyle change diet activity level key instrument arrest reverse condition , conventional medically supervised program prove marginally effective . Bariatric surgery show reliable long-term treatment reduce excess body weight . Though surgical technique evolve complication rate reduce , surgery patient still carry significant mortality morbidity . Techniques instrument develop allow Endoscopic approach procedure aim reduce complication associate open laparoscopic technique procedure . The primary objective study evaluate safety Trans-oral Endoscopic Restrictive Implant System ( TERIS ) procedure treatment obesity six month follow-up period . A secondary objective perform preliminary evaluation efficacy TERIS procedure order guide design future study , include pivotal trial . This prospective feasibility study 3 investigational site 40 subject obese fail standard obesity therapy diet , exercise , behavior modification , pharmacologic agent either alone , combination . Up 60 subject may enrol , undergo baseline evaluation order obtain final total 40 subject appropriate trans-oral implant . Barosense intend use data study support subsequent investigational study , include pivotal trial</detailed_description>
