	<brief_summary>Antiglaucoma medication show induce subclinical conjunctival inflammation considerable proportion glaucoma patient . Today , trabeculectomy still remain gold standard surgical treatment medically uncontrolled glaucoma disease . However , procedure associate variable possible complication , subconjunctival fibrosis frequent one . The latter result non-functional filtering bleb . As consequence , either additional intervention laser suture lysis , needling , bleb revision additional IOP-lowering medication necessary . Previous study demonstrate benefit use topical steroid postoperatively reduce inflammation subsequent subconjunctival fibrosis . In perspective , prospectively explore usefulness topical NSAID corticosteroid therapy preoperatively compare placebo subject schedule first-time trabeculectomy , without interrupt topical antiglaucoma therapy . This allow u determine wether impact longterm topical antiglaucoma therapy subclinical conjunctival inflammation possibly result postoperative fibrosis bleb failure reverse anti-inflammatory medication filtering surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective double-blind randomize placebo-controlled clinical trial approve institutional review board adhere tenet Declaration Helsinki . Patients agree study sign inform consent . Eligible subject subsequently allocate one three topical study medication group computer-based randomisation programme : placebo group receive artificial lacrimal tear ( Liquifilm® ) , NSAID group non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( Aculare® , ketorolac ) , CS group corticosteroid ( FML® , fluorometholone ) . All study medication make pharmaceutical manufacturer ( Allergan™ ) , contain preservative benzalkonium chloride . Each subject 3 study group take one drop study medication four time daily one month filter surgery addition routine antiglaucoma medication . The trabeculectomy technique do accord modify Moorfields procedure experience surgeon ( IS , TZ ) use standard fornix-based approach . Patients postoperatively examine day 1 2 , week 1 , 2 , 4 , month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 follow trabeculectomy . IOP measure Goldmann applanation tonometry . IOP outcomes observed IOP value relative ( percentage reduction ) IOP reduction compare baseline different postoperative time point . In addition , complete ( without additional postoperative medication ) qualify ( without additional postoperative medication ) , number postoperative additional treatment ( needle , laser suture lysis , needle revision ) study eye assess . Statistical Analysis Before onset study , sample size power calculation perform . In addition , randomization programme set . A multivariate regression model use compare IOP evolution three group .</detailed_description>
