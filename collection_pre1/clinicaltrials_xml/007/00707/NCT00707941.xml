	<brief_summary>Background In preparation global influenza pandemic , urgent need representative data population setting pandemic likely arise . There data oseltamivir efficacy Asian urban slum population concern duration illness viral shedding , whether efficacy depend start treatment &lt; 48 hour ≥ 48 hour illness onset . Finally , data capacity drug , setting , affect household community transmission rate . Aims Objectives This proposal aim compare duration clinical illness among patient treat oseltamivir v placebo &lt; 48 hour ≥ 48 hour illness onset . It compare duration viral shed among treatment group vs placebo , risk transmission household contact treatment group whether neuraminidase inhibitor use create resistance . Secondarily aim measure effect influenza . Design Methods A double-blind placebo control clinical trial design among population urban slum current influenza disease burden surveillance enrol . Infection status confirm rRT-PCR . Patients ≥ 1 year old randomise &lt; 48 hour ≥ 48 hour treatment arm . Family member neighbour also assess PCR basic reproductive number calculate ( R0 ) . Relevance These finding address whether oseltamivir affect illness duration severity , affect transmission , incidence resistance high risk urban Asian setting pandemic likely arise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose Influenza disease global importance , cause three pandemic 20th Century . Although concern persist new pandemic , possibly avian influenza A strain , people die 20th Century seasonal epidemic influenza single pandemic , thus global preparedness must address epidemic pandemic influenza . It generally believe pandemic emerges , efficacious vaccine either either generally available broadly protective . Additional strategy require effective control . Neuraminidase inhibitor , include oseltamivir , show efficacy limit controlled trial human influenza , use avian influenza case . Numerous question , however , persist extent efficacy . These include whether effective give 48 hour post-symptom onset , whether reduce duration titre viral shedding , effect transmission household contact , quickly - even - resistance emerge high endemic set seasonal use . Finally , clinical trial date use small sample size control setting industrialized country . There data efficacy neuraminidase inhibitor over-crowded urban setting rate influenza respiratory infection , like Dhaka , Bangladesh . The finding study enable well assessment performance neuraminidase inhibitor condition similar global pandemic likely occur . This study evaluate whether oseltamivir effective reduce illness household transmission seasonal influenza epidemic crowd urban set Dhaka , Bangladesh . Design/Methods This double-blind placebo randomise controlled clinical trial identify study subject clinic present signs/symptoms suggestive influenza . Patients screen use commercial rapid diagnostic test high sensitivity specificity ( QuickVue A + B , Quidel , Inc. , San Diego , CA , USA ) , status confirm use RT-PCR . Rapid test-positive patient randomise oseltamivir placebo standard twice daily , five-day course . A total 512 PCR-confirmed patient recruit treated . Patients provide nasopharyngeal specimen day presentation ( day 0 ) , day 2 , 4 7 determine duration viral shed . All patient follow home daily field research assistant ( FRAs ) , monitor progress use standardised form , refer back clinic anyone meet criteria treatment failure . Once patient meet criteria recovery , refer back clinic exit interview physician . At end study , comparison make group duration illness , duration viral shed household inter-household transmission rate , well whether difference start oseltamivir &lt; 48 hour ≥ 48 hour onset illness . 1 . Requirements subject population , rationale use : The influenza virus , suspect primarily attack old person , recognise cause illness child , particularly &lt; 5 year . Indeed , hospitalisation rate , serious complication , even mortality among healthy child &lt; 5 year approach old person chronic condition place high risk [ 1 ] . Children also potent spreader influenza infection community [ 2 ] . However , order model impact neuraminidase inhibitor duration illness , especially intra inter-household transmission , entire age spectrum must examine , early stage epidemic , adult may among first show infection sign seek treatment , even though child important spread epidemic early stage [ 3 ] . 2 . Potential risk , likelihood , seriousness impact methodology : The risk great minimal , oseltamivir routinely prescribed influenza infection Bangladesh , license drug , potential side effect , common gastrointestinal upset , nausea vomit - rare report , well sleep behaviour disturbance , even less common causally link oseltamivir . Likewise , nasopharyngeal wash swab routinely collect Bangladesh , cause minor discomfort procedure , however complication , primarily nasopharyngeal swab , nosebleed , also uncommon . There alternative procedure sample , need document whether person influenza long . 3 . Procedures minimise risk , effectiveness assessment : 1 ) All physician train procedure specimen collection , ongoing Kamalapur since 2004 . A refresher course provide study physician prior new study ensure correct procedure . 2 ) All physician train potential side effect , relate patient caregiver , currently medication . 3 ) FRAs train look sign illness well complication medication daily home visit , refer back clinic patient sign suggestive complication ( e.g . skin rash , repeat vomit ) . 4 . Confidentiality anonymity : All patient information , record case report form , ( CRF ) keep locked cabinet . Only project staff see . Patients ' name potential identifier remove data share public forum . Published data aggregate anonymised . 5 . Description consent procedure : One consent form household consent participation weekly home visit influenza surveillance , collection sample rapid diagnostics ( nasal swab ) nasopharyngeal wash nasopharyngeal swab specimens index case , subsequent household suspect case ( Household consent , Appendix 1 ) , This form obtain field research assistant ( FRA ) , surveillance form use Kamalapur . This format current influenza surveillance child &lt; 5 year age . The FRA read consent form entirety responsible adult ( legal responsibility child home , child , home ) home , answer question use standardised response ( key point ) . The second consent form obtain consent index case receive antiviral placebo administration , provide subsequent NPW NPS specimens day 2 , 4 7 ( Oseltamivir Study , Appendix 2 ) . A study physician obtain consent form clinic . If subject ( index case ) adult ( age ≥ 18 year ) , consent obtain subject himself/herself ; subject child , consent seek his/her parent legal guardian . The Oseltamivir study consent form readability score Flesh-Kincaid Grade level = 7.8 . An Assent form read child age 7-14 year . The Assent form readability score Flesh-Kincaid Grade level = 5.6 . The methodology obtain consent form standardise . The FRA use home visit consent form , study physician use antiviral administration form , read entire consent form patient parent patient minor , illiterate population . If parent question , study physician provide clarification consent form standardise set key point cover section consent form . Patients , parent patient minor , indicate understand agree term study ask provide write consent . If sign form , thumb impression take . 6 . Interviews : The interview conduct home FRA either screen illness follow-up ill patient home , focus illness sign use standardise screen calendar questionnaire follow-up questionnaire . The interview occur clinic study physician , focus history present illness , past medical history , physical exam , follow-up exit interview , describe . These physician-patient interview fundamentally physician patient , except standardise . 7 . Potential benefit individual society , risk/benefit : Patients may receive direct benefit receive treatment drug , include mild reduction duration influenza symptom . In addition , household member person treat oseltamivir may experience few influenza illness , transmission reduce . Patients receive routine medical care regardless treatment group , even refuse participate study . The daily home follow-up train FRA another benefit , help identify sign indicate need medical attention . The information collect valuable inform future pandemic planning Bangladesh globally , information available regimen develop world . The potential real benefit thus outweigh potential real risk . 8 . Drug status : Oseltamivir ( Tamiflu® ) experimental drug , US Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve , pass Good Clinical Practices license trial , term use trial . Furthermore , oseltamivir manufacture Roche Pharmaceuticals , branch Bangladesh , currently supply local pharmacy drug sale . 9 . Experimental new drug : N/A 10 . Placebo , indication use study : In order objectively demonstrate efficacy drug duration illness specifically , household transmission generally , patient observer blind intervention , knowledge intervention assignment affect record outcome ( observational bias ) . Although know oseltamivir affect illness duration control setting setting low disease burden document Dhaka , Bangladesh , know effective condition , know whether work patient present later illness ( ≥48 hour ) . For reason , patient allocate study arm pre-allotment use block randomisation , along blind use placebo . No patient deny standard care , focal illness , pneumonia , bronchitis , bronchiolitis , otitis medium , sinusitis , common complication influenza similar pathogen , treat standard , WHO-recommended approve regimen . 11 . Experimental 'new ' drug sponsorship : N/A 12 . Use record , organ , tissue , body fluid , faetus/abortus : The study acquire nasopharyngeal wash and/or swab specimen , objective collect nasopharyngeal epithelial cell , use cell culture isolate influenza virus . The purpose isolating influenza virus validate whether patient actually influenza , , long shed .</detailed_description>
