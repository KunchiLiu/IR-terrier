	<brief_summary>Until recently , tuberculin skin test ( TST ) available diagnostic assay detection latent infection M. tuberculosis ( LTBI ) . Despite low overall incidence symptomatic tuberculosis infection low-prevalence country , potential mortality morbidity mandate constant vigilance identify patient risk reactivation . Due systemic immunosuppression , immunocompromised patient latent M. tuberculosis infection increase risk progression active disease . This apply patient various cause immunodeficiency HIV-infected patient , allogeneic stem cell solid organ transplant recipient , patient rheumatoid arthritis patient chronic renal failure . Therefore , current guideline aim prevent tuberculosis infection immunocompromized individual recommend generalize screening evidence latent infection target appropriate preventative prophylaxis . At present , tuberculosis control program exclusively rely tuberculin skin test identify latent infection asymptomatic individual . Recently , novel vitro assay term T cell interferon-gamma release assay ( TIGRA ) become available base detection interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) production T cell supernatant stimulation highly specific antigen M. tuberculosis . Two TIGRA commercially available , ELISPOT base T.SPOT.TB ELISA base QuantiFERON-TB Gold test ( available `` IN-TUBE '' version ) . The aim study prospective comparison two commercially available approve TIGRA ( QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube T.SPOT.TB ) establish Mendel-Mantoux skin-test immunocompromized patient ( main focus sensitivity specificity ) . The study hypotheses follow : 1 . In immunocompromised patient , two commercially available approve TIGRA ( QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube T.SPOT.TB ) increase sensitivity specificity compare establish Mendel-Mantoux skin-test . 2 . Results QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube T.SPOT.TB differ immunocompromised patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Until recently , tuberculin skin test ( TST ) available diagnostic assay detection latent infection M. tuberculosis ( LTBI ) . Despite low overall incidence symptomatic tuberculosis infection low-prevalence country , potential mortality morbidity mandate constant vigilance identify patient risk reactivation . Due systemic immunosuppression , immunocompromised patient latent M. tuberculosis infection increase risk progression active disease . This apply patient various cause immunodeficiency HIV-infected patient , allogeneic stem cell solid organ transplant recipient , patient rheumatoid arthritis patient chronic renal failure . Therefore , current guideline aim prevent tuberculosis infection immunocompromized individual recommend generalize screening evidence latent infection target appropriate preventative prophylaxis . At present , tuberculosis control program exclusively rely tuberculin skin test identify latent infection asymptomatic individual . Recently , novel vitro assay term T cell interferon-gamma release assay ( TIGRA ) become available base detection interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) production T cell supernatant stimulation highly specific antigen M. tuberculosis . Two TIGRA commercially available , ELISPOT base T.SPOT.TB ELISA base QuantiFERON-TB Gold test ( available `` IN-TUBE '' version ) . Current evidence suggest TIGRA base cocktail contain ESAT-6 CFP-10 potential become useful diagnostic tool . It , however , show , rate indeterminate positive result may differ test , suggest might provide different result routine clinical practice . Moreover , inadequate evidence value TIGRA management immunocompromised individual . Based current literature recent meta-analyses , urgent need head-to-head comparative study two commercially available test immunocompromised patient . This study design carry head-to-head comparison T.SPOT.TB ELISA base QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test TST immunosuppressed population . In second step address later stage , study may extend longitudinally assess predictive value positive blood test progression active disease . The study perform within tuberculosis network european trialsgroup ( TBNET ) . It perform multicenter set involve 23 participate center total 14 european country . The study aim include total 1800 study subject distribute follow : 200 HIV infected individual high low CD4 T cells/µl ( 250 CD4 T cell/µl ) , respectively , 200 patient chronic renal failure , 200 stem cell transplant recipient , 200 solid organ transplantation ( lung , liver , kidney , kidney-pancreas ) patient , 200 patient rheumatoid arthritis . In addition , 200 immunocompromised patient confirm tuberculosis , 200 immunocompetent individual similar risk factor patient , 200 immunocompetent control know risk exposure tuberculosis serve control group .</detailed_description>
