	<brief_title>Long Term Follow Up RAD001 Therapy Angiomyolipomata Patients With Tuberous Sclerosis ( TSC ) Sporadic Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberous sclerosis complex genetic disorder birth incidence approximately one six thousand . Angiomyolipomas occur eighty percent person TS , 60 % person LAM . They fatty tumor often occur kidney liver well part body . They grow cause damage surround kidney tissue even renal failure . They may also leak blood cause potentially life-threatening hemorrhage . Laboratory study show RAD001 suppress chemical cause tumor grow tuberous sclerosis sporadic LAM . The use RAD001 treat angiomyolipomas tuberous sclerosis sporadic LAM consider experimental .</detailed_description>
