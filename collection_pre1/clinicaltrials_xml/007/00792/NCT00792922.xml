	<brief_summary>Trachoma , ocular infection cause C. trachomatis , second lead infectious cause blindness worldwide . Years repeat infection C. trachomatis cause eyelid scar contract ultimately rotate inward eyelash rub eyeball abrade cornea ( trichiasis ) . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) endorse multi-faceted strategy combat trachoma , include use antibiotic treatment reduce community pool infection C. trachomatis . The objective study conduct randomize , community-based trial three country ( Niger , Tanzania The Gambia ) , represent different baseline endemicities , alternative coverage frequency administration mass antibiotic treatment well determine cost-effectiveness different strategy program perspective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomize , 2x2 factorial design trial implement three country . Communities randomize two different coverage target ( 80 % -89 % versus â‰¥90 % ) three year mass treatment . In The Gambia Tanzania , community randomize yearly mass treatment versus mass treatment baseline follow yearly mass treatment trachoma prevalence sentinel child great 5 % . The community continue follow treatment resume trachoma prevalence find 20 % great 12 18 month survey . In Niger , communities randomize different coverage level annual mass azithromycin distribution randomize biannual treatment two coverage target child age twelve young . Cross-sectional rate trachoma infection determine examine sentinel child , age five year young , randomly select community base community census . The census update year , village monitor baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 month infection clinical disease . The three-year study accord WHO guideline recommend three year annual mass treatment follow re-survey determine need treatment . We evaluate efficacy guide mass treatment accord laboratory test Chlamydia WHO guideline . Where estimate communities infection rate less 5 % sentinel child , TF rate less 5 % , community `` graduate '' mass treatment follow three year look evidence re-emergent infection disease . If rate infection find 20 % return 12 18 month survey , mass treatment re-initiated .</detailed_description>
