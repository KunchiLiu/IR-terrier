	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect switch antiretroviral combination include efavirenz ( Susitiva® ) , individual experience efavirenz-related side effect , replace investigational HIV medication call Etravirine ( TMC125 ) . The study primarily investigate effect change medication viral load ( level HIV virus blood ) , immunological parameter ( CD4 count ) , safety parameter ( cholesterol ) side effect also quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Switching Individuals Receiving EFV With Continuing Central Nervous System Toxicity TMC125</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority individual commence treatment HIV UK start regimen include EFV combination antiretrovirals . These regimen convenient ( daily dose ) highly efficacious . However EFV several potential drawback include continued CNS toxicity , potential teratogenesis low barrier development virological resistance . In past alternative NNRTI available nevirapine appear low rate virological success associate potentially life threaten toxicity include hepatotoxicity cutaneous toxicity include Stevens-Johnson syndrome . Clinically control trial frequently report undesirable nervous system side effect patient receive 600 mg EFV antiretroviral agent , include dizziness , insomnia , somnolence , impaired concentration abnormal dreaming . CNS symptom moderate severe intensity experience 19.4 % patient compare 9.0 % patient receive control regimen . These symptom severe 2.0 % patient receive EFV 600 mg daily 1.3 % patient receive control regimen . In clinical study 2.1 % patient treat 600 mg EFV discontinue therapy nervous system symptom . Nervous system symptom usually begin first one two day therapy often resolve first 2 -4 week . However significant proportion individual continue adverse effect quality life . CNS toxicity may also worsen drug compliance . In study uninfected volunteer , representative nervous system symptom median time onset 1 hour post dose median duration 3 hour . Nervous system symptom may occur frequently EFV take concomitantly meals possibly due increase EFV plasma . Dosing bedtime seem improve tolerability symptom recommend first week therapy patient continue experience symptom although always successful may associate vivid disturb dream . Dose reduction split daily dose show provide benefit . Other adverse event associate efavirenz include rash ( 5-26 % , usually minor ) , increase cholesterol ( 20-40 % ) triglyceride ( 6-11 % ) , diarrhea ( 3-14 % ) , nausea hyperglycemia ( 2-5 % ) . Serious psychiatric adverse event precipitation psychosis , seizure , suicidal ideation , paranoia , mania aggression also associate use . These see &lt; 1 % take EFV think likely history mental illness/drug abuse predisposition psychological reaction . TMC125 diarylpyrimidine derivative proven efficacy HIV-1 include activity viral isolates exist NNRTI signature mutation . Resistance TMC125 also appear develop less readily EFV NVP . This attribute molecular structure . TMC125 demonstrate safety efficacy short term study treatment-naïve NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 infected patient . Recently publish result phase 3 trial give support finding efficacy reduction HIV-1-RNA level see patient substantial NNRTI PI resistance treat TMC125 plus optimize background . TMC-125 generally well tolerate particular low report rate CNS toxicity EFV . Animal study show low risk teratogenesis . The major toxicity TMC125 skin rash usually self-limiting . In repeat dose trial adverse event ( AEs ) report 10 % subject headache , somnolence , diarrhea , flatulence , nausea vomiting , fatigue , fever , rash , pruritus . Overall , AEs mild moderate intensity , apparent doseresponse relationship . No consistent clinically relevant change electrocardiogram ( ECG ) vital sign observe single repeat TMC125 dose . TMC125 new NNRTI proven efficacy HIV-1 several potential advantage EFV include CNS toxicity high barrier development resistance . This study aim investigate whether substitution EFV TMC125 lead improvement CNS toxicity continue virological suppression immunological reconstitution whether associate improvement quality life .</detailed_description>
