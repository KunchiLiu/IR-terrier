	<detailed_description>Prostate surgery require meticulous dissection around nerve associate structure bladder , seminal vesicle vas deferens . Nerve damage prostatectomy result undesirable outcome impotence urinary incontinence . Robot assist minimally invasive prostatectomy offer enhance visualisation surgical field . Superior clinical outcome term length hospital stay , blood loss , oncologic margin compare open surgery report . Confocal endomicroscopy provide high resolution subsurface cellular image real time already clinical use gastroenterology investigation surgical application . A potential role exist confocal endomicroscopy enhance microscopic nerve identification intra-operatively guide surgical decision make robot-assisted prostatectomy .</detailed_description>
