	<brief_title>Sunitinib Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Transitional Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine objective tumor response rate accord RECIST criterion patient locally advance metastatic transitional cell carcinoma urothelium treat sunitinib malate fail progressed first-line chemotherapy . Secondary - To determine safety drug . - To determine time response duration response . - To determine progression-free survival overall survival patient . - To evaluate quality life patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily 4 week . Courses repeat every 6 week 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
