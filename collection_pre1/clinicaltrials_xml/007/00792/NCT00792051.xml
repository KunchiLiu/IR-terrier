	<detailed_description>Design subject : A double-blind randomise control trial 800 subject age 6-17 drawn general population 2000 household contact . The subject randomise 3:2 ratio intervention placebo group , respectively . Serum sample collect subject pre- 1 month post-vaccination , influenza season . Serum sample collect household contact baseline end influenza season . During follow-up period , subject household member keep symptom diary report influenza-like-illness offer free doctor consultation home visit arrange collection nose throat swab . Study instrument : An antibody titre â‰¥40 post-vaccine serum use define seroprotection particular strain , four-fold high increase antibody titres baseline end-of-season follow-up household contact define influenza infection season . Subjects household contact ask keep symptom diary , episode ILI collect nose throat swab laboratory confirmation influenza infection ; primary serology result compare clinical laboratory-confirmed influenza episode . Interventions : 1 ( intervention ) inactivate influenza vaccine ( Vaxigrip , Sanofi Pasteur ) ; 2 ( placebo ) saline injection .
