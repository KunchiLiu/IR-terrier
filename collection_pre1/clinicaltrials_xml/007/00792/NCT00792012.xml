	<brief_title>A Dose Per Fraction Escalation Trial Hypofractionated IMRT With Temozolomide Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypo-IMRT give few treatment conventional radiation therapy . This dose per fraction escalation study . A dose per fraction escalation study mean successive group patient receive high dos per fraction radiation keep total dose radiation ( 60 Gy , Gy radiation unit ) . The radiation dose per fraction increase number radiation treatment decrease fraction dose reach unacceptable side effect compare possible benefit . Which group subject assign depend stage study reach time subject decide participate . This research do current standard radiation therapy ( A total dose 60 Gy give 2 Gy day 6 week ) outcome poor . New effective radiation therapy method desperately need patient GBM . In study , radiation therapy give together chemotherapy Temozolomide . This study also design monitor level know cytokine ( specific proteins blood ) radiation , meantime screen unknown protein patient ' blood radiation therapy . Hopefully , provide clue future study monitoring radiation damage , possibly new therapeutic approach patient GBM .</detailed_description>
