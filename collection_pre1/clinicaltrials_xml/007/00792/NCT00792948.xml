	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect give combination chemotherapy together without donor stem cell transplant see well work treat patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill cancer cell . Giving chemotherapy total-body irradiation donor stem cell transplant help stop growth cancer cell . It also stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's stem cell . The donated stem cell may replace patient 's immune cell help destroy remain cancer cell ( graft-versus-tumor effect ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Donor Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test whether relapse-free survival allogeneic stem cell transplantation among Philadelphia chromosome positive and/or breakpoint cluster region ( BCR ) /Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene ( ABL ) positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) patient give intensive short-term chemotherapy regimen fractionate cyclophosphamide , vincristine sulfate , doxorubicin hydrochloride , dexamethasone ( hyper-CVAD ) combination tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib sufficiently high warrant investigation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test whether continuous complete remission rate previously untreated Philadelphia chromosome positive and/or BCR/ABL positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) patient give intensive short-term chemotherapy regimen hyper-CVAD combination tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib sufficiently high warrant phase III investigation . II . To investigate preliminary manner relative effectiveness minimal residual disease ( MRD ) detection use real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) BCR/ABL versus flow cytometry predict outcome patient treat hyper-CVAD + dasatinib regimen and/or allogeneic stem cell transplant . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate frequency severity toxicity intensive short-term chemotherapy regimen patient . II . To estimate overall survival patient study .

INTENSIFICATION : For course 6 13 , patient receive cyclophosphamide IV 3 hour BID day 1-3 ; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 24 hour day 4 ; vincristine sulfate IV 30 minute day 4 11 ; dexamethasone IV PO QD day 1-4 11-14 ; dasatinib PO QD day 1-14 ; G-CSF SC QD BID . NOTE : *Only transplantation ready induction/consolidation therapy patient undergoing transplant . ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION ( FOR PATIENTS ACHIEVING CR OR CRi ) : CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients receive 1 follow regimen : REGIMEN A : Patients receive total-body irradiation ( TBI ) QD day -7 -4 cyclophosphamide IV day -3 -2 . REGIMEN B : Patients receive TBI BID day -6 -4 cyclophosphamide IV day -3 -2 . REGIMEN C : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV day -7 -6 TBI QD day -4 -1 . REGIMEN D : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV day -6 -5 TBI BID day -3 -1 . REGIMEN E : Patients receive TBI QD day -7 -4 etoposide IV day -3 . REGIMEN F : Patients receive TBI BID day -6 -4 etoposide IV day -3 . ALLOGENEIC STEM CALL TRANSPLANTATION : Patients undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation day 0 . GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE ( GVHD ) PROPHYLAXIS : Patients receive 1 follow regimen : REGIMEN A : Patients receive sirolimus PO tacrolimus IV continuously ( change PO BID ) begin day -3 continue 6 month . REGIMEN B : Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously ( change PO BID ) continue 6 month , methotrexate IV day 1 , 3 , 6 , 11 . SINGLE-AGENT THERAPY : After completion maintenance therapy begin day 100 post-transplantation , patient receive dasatinib PO QD 5 year . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
