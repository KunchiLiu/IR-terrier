	<detailed_description>Stroke common cause permanent disability , second common cause dementia third common cause death elderly industrialize country . Approximately 85 % stroke due cerebral ischemia , whereas 15 % due cerebral hemorrhage . In 1998 , 600.000 new stroke occur within European Union . Since incidence stroke strongly age-related , number stroke victim expect increase substantially next decade proportion subject older 70 estimate grow 13 % 20 % ( Wahlgren 2001 ; The European stroke initiative , 2000 ) . Within next 8 year yearly direct cost stroke estimate 27 billion â‚¬ Germany ( Kolominsky-Rabas et al. , 2006 ) . Due increase incidence future , cost expect increase 10 - 15 % within next 10 year . The main cause ischemic stroke thromboembolic occlusion cerebral vessel embolism heart brain feeding artery . This occlusion cerebral artery lead immediate drop blood flow correspond arterial territory . This reduce blood flow lead known neurological symptom affect brain area . Animal experiment show massive cellular death occurs within minute occlusion intracerebral artery centre ischemic lesion ( infarction core ) . The region surround area ( penumbra ) high risk functionally reduce blood flow . By improve blood flow , area could potentially rescue therefore represent focus every stroke therapy . Aggravatingly , first irreversible cellular death penumbra start early 30 minute 1 hour stroke onset ( Astrup et al. , 1981 ; Heiss et al. , 1983 ; Garcia et al. , 1995 ; Watanabe et al. , 1977 ; Siesjo et al. , 1992 ; Hossmann 1994 ; Hu et al. , 2001 ) . Based data , causal therapy ischemic stroke appear possible , cerebral blood flow re-established within first hour symptom onset ( Dyker et al. , 1998 ; Kasner et al. , 1997 ; Adams et al. , 1996 ; Brott et al. , 1992 ; Del Zoppo et al. , 1996 ; Zivin , 1998 ) . Currently , systemic thrombolysis recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) , approve Germany since 2000 , represent first evidence-based causal treatment acute ischemic stroke . The therapy perform early possible minimize cerebral injury avoid complication ( i.e. , hemorrhagie ) . Treatment rt-PA study 6 large randomize placebo-controlled multi-centre study ( The National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke rt-PA Stroke Study Group , 1995 ; Hacke et al . 1995 ; Hacke et al. , 1998 ; Clark et al. , 2000 ) . Meta-analysis study show thrombolytic therapy within first 3 hour result significant reduction disability death ( Hacke et al. , 1998 ; 2004 ) . The chance save brain tissue thrombolytic therapy exponentially decrease passing time . In case , patient examine emergency physician , begin final thrombolysis therapy delay variety factor , like delivery hospital , neurologist re-examinations , delay blood analysis CT scan . Due , therapy decision possible within first 3 hour minority stroke patient . This contribute low lysis rate 4-7 % stroke patient . The odds ratio ( OR ) favourable 3-month outcome stroke therapy converges 1 first 4 hour favour rt-PA group ( Hacke et al. , 2004 ) . Meta-analyses demonstrate reduction time begin thrombolytic therapy best potential reduce disable effect stroke . The rational study investigate whether `` Mobile Stroke Unit '' contribute well stroke management save precious time therapeutic decision make , accord concept `` time brain '' .</detailed_description>
