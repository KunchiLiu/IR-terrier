	<detailed_description>Juvenile arthritis chronic disease affect approximately 250,000 people young 16 year age United States . Its symptom include swell , pain , damage joint . Juvenile arthritis take four different form , include poly JIA . Poly JIA affect five joint , generally small one wrist finger , cause stiffness , joint damage , sometimes eye inflammation child adolescent suffer . Approximately 30 % people juvenile arthritis Poly JIA . Treatment juvenile arthritis involve drug escalate strength , depend individual responds best . The first treatment option non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , Motrin IB Aleve . The second treatment option methotrexate ( MTX ) . About 30 % 50 % poly JIA patient effectively treat MTX . Only patient respond MTX anti-TNF drug use . Anti-TNF drug often result profound disease improvement , unfortunately , toxic side effect expensive . For people whose poly JIA inactive minimally active MTX anti-TNF drug , 50 % 80 % experience worsening symptom stop take medication . Most flare-ups occur within 8 month stop treatment . Currently , way predict people poly JIA safely stop anti-TNF medication . This study evaluate two different factors—levels certain calcium binding proteins production TNF—for use predict whether people poly JIA likely experience disease flare-up stop anti-TNF treatment . The study also look genetic marker serve predictor safe discontinuation anti-TNF treatment . Participation study last 14 month involve nine study visit . Visits conduct study entry 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 14 month . The first three study visit involve test determine baseline health indicator ensure inactive disease . If , 6 month , participant continue inactive disease , take anti-TNF medication . For remainder study , visit use monitor disease activity . If participant experience clinically define disease flare-up , immediately stop participate study begin additional treatment prescribe health care provider . At study visit , participant undergo general physical examination , joint examination , questionnaires disease affect live , blood collection research sample .</detailed_description>
