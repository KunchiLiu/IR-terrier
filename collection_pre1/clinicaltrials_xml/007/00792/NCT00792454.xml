	<brief_summary>The mortality rate treat patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) 22 death patient-years risk 2006 . Incident patient ESRD vulnerable within first 90 day dialysis , annualized mortality rate 50 deaths/100 patient year . The vast majority death due cardiovascular cause . As cardiac rehabilitation program show 20 % reduction one year overall mortality rate post myocardial infarction investigator propose similar type rehabilitation program also benificial effect morbidity mortality patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ESRD.The overall goal project study whether renal rehabilitation program base guide exercise implement patient stage III stage IV CKD influence mortality rate patient prior first 90 day dialysis Hypothesis : The application guide exercise program ( renal rehabilitation ) institute patient stage III Stage IV CKD decrease mortality rate prior initiation renal replacement therapy . Hypothesis : The application renal rehabilitation late stage CKD decrease mortality risk first 90 day renal rehabilitation therapy . Hypothesis : A guided exercise program immediate prolong effect activity level , mental health adaption chronic illness patient advance CKD .</brief_summary>
