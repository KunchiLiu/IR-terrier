	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy drug surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . Sometimes , surgery , tumor may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gemcitabine together cisplatin work treat patient stage I non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0720 : Adjuvant Therapy Based Gene Expression Stage IA IB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess feasibility assign adjuvant treatment base tumoral RRM1 ERCC1 gene expression patient complete surgical resection stage IA ( ≥ 2 cm ) IB non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - To estimate collective 2-year disease-free survival patient . - To assess frequency severity toxicity result administration cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride . - To explore , preliminarily , relationship RNA protein expression RRM1 ERCC1 , relationship RRM1 ERCC1 expression formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimen , generate result situ protein expression assay gene involve drug efficacy . - To assess analytical performance biomarker assay . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm base RRM1 ERCC1 gene expression . - Arm I ( RRM1 ≥ 40 ERCC1 ≥ 65 ) : Patients undergo active monitoring surgery disease assessments 8 , 16 , 24 week . - Arm II ( RRM1 &lt; 40 and/or ERCC1 &lt; 65 ) : Beginning within 84 day surgery , patient receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 cisplatin IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor sample acquire time surgery analyze immunofluorescence-based automated quantitative analysis situ expression RRM1 ERCC1 . If available , additional sample assess use RT-PCR real-time quantitative PCR RRM1 ERCC1 expression level ; polymorphism analysis RRM1 ERCC1 expression protein level ; tissue microarray analysis gene associate DNA synthesis , damage repair , drug efficacy . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
