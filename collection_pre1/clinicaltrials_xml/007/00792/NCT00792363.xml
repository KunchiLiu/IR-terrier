	<brief_title>Irinotecan Panitumumab 3rd Line Treatment mCRC Without KRAS Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer one frequent type cancer Denmark approximately 3,400 diagnosed patient per year . The prognosis patient still poor half develop metastatic disease thus candidate chemotherapy . In Denmark 5-FU Oxaliplatin Irinotecan use several year either combination mono therapy . In recent year biological antibody target EGFR add treatment . A newly develop antibody Panitumumab , enable treatment every 3 week instead weekly administration . The effect EGFR activation mediate intracellular pathway involve KRAS protein . It proven mutation KRAS cause KRAS protein constantly activate , patient mutation benefit antibody EGFR . Approximately 40 % patient present mutation .</detailed_description>
