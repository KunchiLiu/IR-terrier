	<brief_summary>This open label , phase IIa High Pulse Dose Clinical Trial test ITF2357 ( orally administration ) adult patient relapsing/refractory multiple myeloma least 2 previous line treatment . Patients receive ITF2357 accordance follow scheme : Weeks 1-6 Patient # 01 administer ITF 2357 400 mg one single dose day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 36 . Safety assessment perform twice week . If issue ( grade &gt; 3 neutropenia grade ≥3 toxicity ) emerge day 15 two patient ( # 02 # 03 ) enrol receive dose . If patient # 02 # 03 show favourable safety profile day 15 , meantime safety concern arise patient # 01 , patient enrol treat accord reported scheme : - 8 patient ( # 04-11 ) receive 400 mg weekly ; safety assessment perform weekly . - 1 patient ( # 12 ) receive 600 mg weekly ; safety assessment perform twice week . If safety concern emerge patient 12 day 15 , two patient ( # 13 # 14 ) enrol treated 600 mg weekly . If patient # 13 # 14 n't show relevant safety concern ( grade &gt; 3 neutropenia grade ≥3 toxicity ) day 15 , meanwhile patient # 12 maintains favourable safety profile , eight patient ( # 15-22 ) recruit receive treatment regimen . If grade &gt; 3 neutropenia grade ≥3 toxicity appear time week 1-6 , treatment permanently discontinue . In phase treatment administer inpatient basis . Weeks 7-12 For patient still therapy day 43 visit , M protein quantify treatment continue possibly modify follow basis parameter : Decrease &gt; or= 25 % : patient 400/week group continue 400mg 6 week patient 600/week group continue 600mg 6 week Stable +or- 25 % : patient 400/week group increase 600mg continue 6 week patient 600/week group add dexamethasone 40mg 4 days/week ( day 1-4 ) continue 600mg 6 week Increase &gt; 25 % : patient 400/week group add dexamethasone 40mg 4 days/week ( day 1-4 ) continue 400mg 6 week patient 600/week group failure : study patient 600/week group Safety assessment perform weekly interval . In case grade &gt; 3 neutropenia grade ≥3 toxicity treatment permanently discontinue . In phase treatment administer inpatient basis . Weeks 13-18 For patient still therapy day 85 ( week 13 , day 1 ) , response rate quantify accord EBMT criterion . In case response ( complete , partial minimal ) stable disease ( change ) treatment prolong week 18 , whereas case disease progression patient leave study . A new complete efficacy evaluation perform day 127 ( end treatment ) . During phase safety assess weekly interval case grade &gt; 3 neutropenia grade ≥3 toxicity treatment permanently discontinue . This phase study conduct outpatient basis . No dosage modification temporary discontinuation admit Primary objective : To assess safety ITF2357 administer weekly high pulse dose patient relapsing/refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
