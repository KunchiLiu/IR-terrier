Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea may lead serious consequence like inflammation large bowel case , death . There study suggest Bio-K drink , probiotic preparation contain lactobacillus acidophilus lactobacillus casei , decrease risk diarrhea antibiotic use . As result , St. Joseph 's Healthcare recently use Bio-K routinely try reduce risk patient develop diarrhea . No Hamilton hospital use Bio-K routinely strong evidence effectiveness Bio-K prevention diarrhea . This study provide information Bio-K 's effectiveness prevention diarrhea associate antibiotic use capsule drink .</brief_summary>
