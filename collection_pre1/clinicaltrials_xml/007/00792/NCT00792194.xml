	<brief_summary>Life expectancy patient cystic fibrosis improve dramatically last year . Respiratory complication remain main contributory factor morbidity mortality associate disease . Exercise tolerance reduce disease progress , peak aerobic capacity seem link survival . Regular physical activity positive benefit , include good body image , improvement pulmonary function , exercise capacity possible improvement quality life.But considerable variability subject , exercise program tailor individual need , easy include cumbersome treatment routine professional activity . In cystic fibrosis center Strasbourg able propose patient one-year physical exercise program , partly supervise coach , home . Electronically braked cycle ergometer heart rate monitoring system patient disposal , one year , home . Thus , patient choose , day , best moment work .Subjects randomise two groups:1. control group , subject ask continue normal daily activity physiotherapy regime.2 . train group , subject ask exercise three time week . For train group , three time week , patient train 30 minute . Heart rate continuously monitor send medical staff every week-end . A correction exercise intensity , need , weekly propose maintain maximal training efficiency , coach help , necessary . For two group , quality life measure disease-specific questionnaire ( CFQ14+ ) ( Henry , 1998 , Quittner , 2000 ) , generic questionnaire ( SF 36 ) ( Gee , 2002 ) program , 6 12 month . After one year training program , compare control group , expect improvement aerobic capacity peak oxygen consumption , associate improved prognosis cystic fibrosis . We also expect observe improvement quality life measurement , short hospital stay few exacerbation . With kind program , also would like improve degree adherence daily life exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We hope regular contact coach medical staff provide self-confidence . Thus , patient probably able choose physical activity enjoyable , share others ( family , friend ) , give real benefit term health status .</detailed_description>
