	<brief_summary>Low current electrical stimulation test , also call Tsui test , use successfully confirm catheter location epidural space various patient population . The result study show whether Tsui test predict inadequate epidural analgesia early course place epidural , appropriate measure could apply immediately upon gather unfavorable result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite high success rate , epidural technique remain rather blind technique , failure continue occur . The incidence reason failure well understood . The Tsui test routinely perform epidural catheter insertion , rather use suspicion catheter location . In study , Tsui test perform twice epidural procedure , bupivacaine consumption record first 2 hour . Information gain study could great impact clinical practice , since incidence inadequate labor analgesia still relatively high ( 10-20 % ) , lead maternal distress disappointing labor experience .</detailed_description>
