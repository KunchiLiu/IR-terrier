	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness new procedure place DBS electrode , entire surgery perform within MRI scanner ( `` interventional MRI '' ) , patient fully asleep ( general anesthesia ) . The standard method placement deep brain stimulators use MRI actual DBS placement . The standard method involve placement rigid frame patient 's head , performance short MRI scan , transport operating room , placement DBS electrodes operating room , return MRI suite another MR confirm correct electrode placement . In standard method , patient must awake 2-4 hour operate room `` brain mapping '' perform , brain target confirm pass `` microelectrodes '' ( thin wire ) brain record electrical activity . In standard method , general anesthesia require . In study , surgery guide entirely MRI image perform multiple time DBS electrode advance . This eliminate need patient awake , eliminate need pass microelectrodes brain place permanent DBS electrode .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Interventional MRI Implantation Deep Brain Stimulator Electrodes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) new increasingly common surgical technique treatment Parkinson 's disease dystonia . The current technical approach DBS implantation involve frame-based stereotaxy . In method , stereotactic frame rigidly fix patient 's skull , MRI obtain , anatomic target identify , coordinate target stereotactic space calculate . Instruments mount stereotactic frame point calculate coordinate . However , due inherent inaccuracy standard frame-based stereotaxy , complex 6-hour procedure ensue `` map '' brain target microelectrodes , place lead , return MR unit confirm proper placement . The goal project test feasibility perform DBS implantation entirely within Phillips 1.5T Siemens 3T open magnet MRI machine . Prior study initiation , instrumentation MR protocol test use phantom head . In proposed project , subthalamic nucleus globus pallidus DBS implantation perform bilaterally patient Parkinson 's disease dystonia . Patients general anesthesia . Targeting lead verification perform image alone , without physiologic mapping . Data gather following : operative time , degree benefit bilateral implantation ( change standard rating scale motor disability ) , DBS voltage requirement , complication ) , electrode location MR . These measure compare historical control , previously enter research database , electrode place standard method . We expect use near real time MR improve speed accuracy DBS implantation , eliminate need invasive physiological monitoring .</detailed_description>
