	<brief_summary>This single-center , open label , phase II study aim test activity multiple cycle ITF2357 follow Mechlorethamine administer patient relapsed/refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Patients receive maximum twelve 3-week cycle ITF2357 follow Mechlorethamine accord follow schema : - ITF2357 , 50 mg every 6 hour , per o , day 1 - 3 - Mechlorethamine , 6 mg/sqm , intravenously , day 4 Study therapy administer every 21 day long evidence progressive disease unacceptable adverse event patient 's request discontinue treatment occur , case maximum 12 cycle . Decision regard continuation ITF2357/Mechlorethamine therapy make ( ) basis tumor reassessment follow cycle 2 , 6 , 9 , 12 ( ii ) occurrence toxicity . Tumor response evaluate accord International Working Group response criterion HL . Treatment administrate outpatient basis patient follow regularly physical laboratory test , specify protocol ; case hospitalisation , treatment continue interrupted accord Investigators ' decision . The study accrue 23 patient evaluable efficacy anticipate duration study 24 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Histone-Deacetylase Inhibitor ITF2357 Followed Mechlorethamine Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) enzymes involved remodel chromatin , key role epigenetic regulation gene expression . In addition , activity non-histone protein regulate HDAC-mediated hypoacetylation . In recent year , inhibition HDACs emerge potential strategy reverse aberrant epigenetic change associate cancer , several class HDAC inhibitor find potent specific anticancer activity preclinical study . Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) relatively uncommon lymphoma histotype , incidence Italy approximately 1700 new case per year ( approximately 12 % lymphoma ) . Combination chemotherapy without radiotherapy cure approximately 70 percent advanced-stage HL . Fifty percent fail patient salvage second line chemotherapy ( mainly high-dose regimen ) , remain patient eventually die disease progression . The development effective salvage regimen refractory/resistant population represent true unmet medical need . The use latter patient subset HDAC inhibitor , like ITF2357 , support several consideration . Namely : ( 1 ) relate hydroxamate , SAHA , show activity clinical condition ; ( 2 ) drug markedly inhibit production several cytokine , cytokine production HL granuloma define role pathogenesis HL ; ( 3 ) effective treatment refractory/relapsed HL presently lack ; ( 4 ) ITF2357 , 200 mg daily per o , show favorable toxicity profile . All mention argument represent strong rationale prompting use ITF2357 patient population .</detailed_description>
