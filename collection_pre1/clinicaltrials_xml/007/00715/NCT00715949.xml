	<brief_summary>Brain injury trauma common child , often result death disability . Most brain injury minor , yet treatment challenging . Because many different scale use characterize severity brain injury , consensus regard manage patient minor brain injury . Specifically , agreement recommendation regard safety return activity follow injury . In young athlete minor brain injury ( i.e . concussion ) strong data suggest return baseline neurologic function often delayed day week . Children allow return activity soon may high risk second concussion , may delay recovery , rare case , die . Researchers design computer-based testing system ( ImPACT© ) objectively test neurologic deficit follow injury . This test use primarily athletes follow concussion also applicable child brain injury non-sports related trauma . We propose utilize test pediatric patient admit hospital minor brain injury . The test would administer time hospitalization well outpatient trauma clinic time routine follow . The test would allow u determine neurologic deficit , potentially subclinical , brain injured patient quickly recover injury . If successful , test likely useful clinical setting primary care office ( e.g . pediatrician ) , specialty care office ( e.g . sport medicine ) , emergency room determine injure child require additional intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurocognitive Evaluation Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Hospitalized Pediatric Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Head injuries frequent source morbidity common source mortality pediatric trauma population . [ 1 ] It estimate head injury result 500,000 emergency department visit , 95,000 hospital admission 7,000 death pediatric age-groups . [ 1 ] Despite magnitude number , likely underestimate problem , many injured child bring medical attention . Fortunately , head injury ( 75 % ) classify minor . [ 2 ] While major head injury obviously pose great threat life individual , sheer volume minor head injury , well potential endure neurologic sequela , make significant public health problem . Management large group patient challenge due lack consensus health care community regard definition minor traumatic brain injury , ideal assessment modality injure child recommendation return activity follow brain injury . Return play recommendation traditionally base grade concussion clinical exam . However give large number concussion grade scale existence subtle nature many neurologic deficit , standard recommendation lack . Further still , tremendous variability time full recovery exhibit brain-injured child make generic guideline naïve . While recovery head injury child variable difficult predict , desire return activity however , near constant . Determining safe return play thus important . Recent literature highlight perils premature return activity ( notably contact sport ) child traumatic brain injury . [ 3-6 ] Dangers include prolongation post-concussive symptom , increase risk recurrence injury death . [ 3-6 ] Further , danger may common young athlete . [ 7 ] However , evidence even non-contact , exertional activity may detrimental initiated quickly . It observation First International Conference Concussion Sport previously publish guideline management concussion adequate assessment concussion . Further , recognize utility neuropsychological test understanding injury determine management concuss patient . [ 8 ] Unfortunately , majority treat clinician tool available help determine appropriate individual return activity . One tool use extensively effectively head injure athlete Immediate Post concussion Assessment Cognitive Testing ( ImPACT© ) program . This interactive software program originally design assess subjective objective cognitive ability head injured athlete . The program validate use sports-related concussion . [ 9 , 10 ] Studies concuss athlete demonstrate much slow return baseline previously appreciate . [ 11 ] Further , young athlete ( high school vs. college professional ) slow return baseline . [ 7 ] This program prove quite useful determine optimal time return activity population head injure athlete provide objective data upon base recommendation . The decision face clinician treat child sport relate head injury also exist non-sports related mechanism ( e.g . motor vehicle collision , fall ) . Motor vehicle related cause fall common source traumatic brain injury child . [ 12 ] Sports recreation account le 10 % hospitalize minor traumatic brain injury . Non-sports related traumatic brain injury often severe equally difficult ass . Anecdotal evidence collect researcher ImPACT© team suggest neurocognitive test would similarly efficacious assessment non-sports related brain injured patient . Utilizing treatment algorithm involve neurocognitive test level individual likely effectively determine suitability return activity need specialty intervention . SPECIFIC AIMS 1 . To assess feasibility inpatient bedside neurocognitive test pediatric patient minor traumatic brain injury . 2 . To establish neurocognitive deficit exist , extent , cohort hospitalize pediatric patient minor traumatic brain injury . 3 . To document time extent recovery pediatric traumatic brain injury follow-up neurocognitive testing .</detailed_description>
