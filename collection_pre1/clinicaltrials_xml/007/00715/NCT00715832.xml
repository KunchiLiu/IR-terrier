	<brief_summary>The study use molecule particle find cancer cell unique cancer cell , detect normal tissue . The molecule know `` oncofetal antigen '' OFA . Because OFA unique cancer , investigator feel OFA could use educate patient ' defense effectively fight cancer , harbor . Although investigator find OFA present large concentration cancer , find especially abundant breast cancer . Therefore , investigator feel molecule would good target stimulate patient defense especially breast cancer cell . To accomplish , certain defense cell ( immune cell ) wash patient ' blood use machine patient connect two small cannula place vein locate patient ' arm . Those cell manipulate laboratory artificially engineer OFA . These `` reeducated '' cell inject skin patient . There series three skin injection 4 week interval . It hop treatment convert patient ' defense point effective anti cancer response induce . Effectiveness treatment monitor blood test assessment size cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Cancer Vaccine Study Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study open-label study ass safety immune response universal tumor antigen OFA/iLRP . All patient immunize 1 x 107 viable OFA/iLRP-loaded mature , autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cell ( DCs ) . The DC vaccine administer intradermally proximal medial upper extremity , contralateral original site breast cancer every month 3 month . Changes tumor document . The patient remain study unless toxicity adverse side effect require discontinuation follow RECIST CTC guideline , patient withdraws reason .</detailed_description>
