	<detailed_description>Previous study show , patient learn new motor movement , may cause change way nerve act area brain control movement . This change call use-dependent plasticity . The ability part brain , call motor cortex ( M1 ) , reorganize play major role recovery motor deficits post-stroke ; hence importance development rehabilitative strategy utilize potential recovery . In proposed study examine influence use-dependent plasticity non-injured M1 healthy subject injure M1 stroke subject use combination non-invasive cortical stimulation , medication , exercise technique . In Specific Aim 1 , test effect drug interact specifically different neurotransmitter system use-dependent plasticity intact M1 healthy human . In Specific Aim 2 , identify parameter non-invasive TMS stimulation M1 effective enhance use-dependent plasticity intact healthy human M1 . Specific Aim 3 ass efficacy plasticity enhance method develop non-injured M1 healthy subject ( Specific Aims 1 &amp; 2 ) injure M1 stroke patient . Our proposal link science neurorehabilitation practice stroke patient apply principle know enhance practice dependent plasticity intact human M1 injure M1 stroke patient enhance motor recovery . These newly design rehabilitation strategy could potentially reduce morbidity disability stroke , thus , reduce dramatically cost long-term ambulatory nursing home care . The positive impact field neurorehabilitation considerable .</detailed_description>
