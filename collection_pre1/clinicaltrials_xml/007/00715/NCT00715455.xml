	<brief_title>Feasibility Safety Study Comparing REG1 Anticoagulation System With Unfractionated Heparin Elective PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study drug , REG1 , first specific , direct-acting , antidote-controlled anticoagulant ever describe . Regado develop REG1 use patient suffer acute coronary syndrome undergo coronary revascularization procedure . These procedure , include coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , put patient high risk therapy-related bleeding complication . REG1 develop initially increase therapeutic flexibility improve patient outcomes coronary revascularization procedure . REG1 two-component system , consist aptamer-based anticoagulant match antidote . The REG1 anticoagulant component ( RB006 ) single-stranded , nucleic acid aptamer . RB006 selectively potently bind inhibits Factor IXa , protein critical blood coagulation . The antidote component , RB007 , complementary nucleic acid bind neutralizes RB006 . The binding RB007 RB006 cause predictable rapid reversal RB006 effect allow patient 's blood return normal .</detailed_description>
