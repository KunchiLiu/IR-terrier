	<detailed_description>Background : Low mobility , define limited bed chair , common acute hospitalization . The candidate 's work demonstrate low mobility associate adverse outcome include functional decline , need new nursing home admission , death even control illness severity comorbidity . Objective : Using Phase II trial design , impact safety hospital walk program old patient acute general medical hospitalization evaluate . Project Design : 100 patient , age 65 year admit medical ward Birmingham VAMC recruit within 48 hour hospitalization follow 14 day enrollment discharge , ever come first . Exclusion criterion include : ( 1 ) Delirious base positive Confusion Assessment Method ( CAM ) ; ( 2 ) Mini Mental State Examination Score &lt; 17 ; ( 3 ) Patient isolation ; ( 4 ) Inability ambulate 2 week prior admission ; ( 5 ) Having medical diagnosis deem primary physician contraindication ambulation ; ( 6 ) patient imminently terminal illness ; ( 7 ) Non-English speaking . Participants randomize either usual care ( UC ) hospital walk program ( WP ) , include twice daily walk assistance , provision necessary ambulatory device , behavioral intervention strategy design encourage bed activity . Throughout hospitalization , WP UC veteran wear ipsilateral thigh ankle wireless monitor measure horizontal vertical orientation respect gravity . Previously validated candidate ass level mobility hospitalization , output use calculate length time patient spend lie , sit , stand walking , use pre-defined criterion . Other daily measure include orthostatic blood pressure , functional assessment , assessment fall symptom previous 24-hours . The primary outcome measure time bed measure wireless monitor . Importantly , goal ass amount mobility occur result hospital walk program occur beyond intervention . In previous VA-funded study , patient spend average 17.1 % 4.1 hour bed per 24-hour period time ( s.d . 2.9 ) . Our goal increase 50 % 2 hour average 6.1 hour . This result effect size 0.69 standard deviation unit . A sample size 45 per group provide 90 % power detect 2-hour difference amount time patient spend bed = .05 level . Significance : present paucity data regard impact safety hospital walk program general medical patient . Results study enable researcher determine safety efficacy walk program old veteran hospitalization provide information regard effect size definitive intervention trial .</detailed_description>
