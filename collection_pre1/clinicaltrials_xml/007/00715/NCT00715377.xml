	<detailed_description>Anticholinergic antiparkinsonian agent ( AAAs ) frequently prescribe patient primary psychotic disorder either treat prevent emergence antipsychotic induce extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) . Second generation antipsychotic ( SGAs ) definition associate few neurological side effect . This would expect associated low use AAAs . However , recent prescription survey , Park colleague find rate concomitant use antiparkinsonian agent drop 9.2 % patient schizophrenia change antipsychotic typical antipsychotic SGAs , 30 % prescription SGAs include concomitant antiparkinsonian agent . This consistent result cross-sectional survey demonstrate anticholinergic co-prescription rate 12 - 65 % patient treat SGA . These high rate remarkable especially one considers incidence EPS report past clinical trial use SGAs ( 3 - 20 % ) much low report co-prescription rate . This apparent discrepancy likely explain , part , establish tradition prophylactic ( routine ) use AAAs patient start antipsychotic drug . The adverse effect AAAs well known , particularly significant clinically elderly , high risk cognitive impairment AAAs . Anticholigergic effect report impair cognitive function globally well specific domain , include memory executive functioning . The association anticholinergic activity cognitive performance also strongly support recent study measure serum anticholinergic activity ( SAA ) . Furthermore , addition well-known side effect dry mouth , blur vision , constipation , also report increase risk tardive kinesia claim negative impact clinical efficacy antipsychotic drug . In view adverse effect , World Health Organization discourage prophylactic use AAAs , careful risk-benefit analysis necessary individual patient . Since case antipsychotic-induced EPS present within 11 week initiation antipsychotic treatment dosage increase , trial AAA taper discontinuation recommend follow 3 month regular AAA treatment . These recommendation emerge prior widespread use SGAs , one might expect successful discontinuation concomitant AAAs would higher SGAs conventional antipsychotic . AAA discontinuation trial conventional antipsychotic inconsistent , study report favorable outcome others report re-emergence EPS . More recently Mori et al report favorable outcome follow AAA discontinuation cognition EPS patient maintain chlorpromazine , risperidone , haloperidol mixed age population schizophrenia . The study AAA discontinuation old patient schizophrenia also report improved cognitive function sample 21 elderly inpatient schizophrenia . However , study include extrapyramidal symptom , psychopathology , side effect AAAs outcome measure . Furthermore , improvement cognitive function report study could attribute practice effect : Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale administer interval 10 day - though learning effect scale studied patient schizophrenia . Older patient schizophrenia would expect particularly sensitive side effect antipsychotic AAAs due age-related change pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics . However , view well know adverse effect AAAs elderly , use anticholinergic drug specifically include 2002 criterion potentially inappropriate medication use old adult . This may especially relevant old patient schizophrenia since cognitive function already impaired function dual effect age-related decline cognitive difficulty inherent psychotic illness . Concomitant use AAAs would expect lead decline cognitive social functioning . We therefore propose open-label prospective trial ass feasibility reduce dose frequently prescribe AAA Centre , benztropine , old subject primary psychotic disorder SGAs use validated assessment scale method . In order quantify anticholinergic burden patient AAA dose reduction , serum anticholinergic activity also assess .</detailed_description>
