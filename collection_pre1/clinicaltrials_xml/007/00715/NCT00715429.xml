Baseline , mid-study , final laboratory test assess change 25-hydroxyvitamin D related variable ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D best measure vitamin D status . ) The time begin diary run-in final dose drug last lab , 14 week . Optimal vitamin D status health unknown , although many expert aim serum 25hydroxyvitamin D 35-40 ng/ml . Subjects study randomize vitamin D take vitamin D capsule ( 50,000 unit ) daily 10 day , follow weekly vitamin D ( 50,000 unit ) maintenance dose 7 week . Based published literature ability vitamin D raise serum 25OHD time , estimate loading dose `` boost '' level 10 day increment ~40ng/ml ( ~65 ng/mL total , start typical person 's baseline 25ng/ml ) . This achieve level 65 within reference range VA 's reference range 20-100 . ( In PI 's experience , veteran without special D supplementation baseline level 15 40 ) .</detailed_description>
