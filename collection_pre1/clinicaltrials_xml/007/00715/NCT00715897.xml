	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Induced Neuroplasticity Post Stroke Patients Suffering Chronic Neurological Deficiencies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Evaluate effect hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) patient chronic neurological deficiency due stroke . Methods : A prospective , randomize , control-crossed trial include patient stroke 6-36 month prior inclusion . All patient least one motor dysfunction . After inclusion patient randomize treated cross group . The neurologic function evaluate NIHSS , ADL , life quality brain SPECT . Patients treat group evaluate twice-at baseline HBOT . Patients cross group evaluate three times-baseline , 2 month control period treatment consequent 2 month HBOT . The following HBOT protocol practice : 40 daily session , 90 minute , 100 % oxygen 2ATA , 5 days/week , . Results : The study include 74 patient ( 8 exclude ) . During control period , cross group , NIHSS ADL change , treat group significantly improve . After cross-over , cross group receive HBOT , NIHSS ADL significantly improve . Same trend change life quality . The SPECT correlate clinical improvement . The improvement mostly territories noticeable discrepancy CT SPECT . Interpretation : In study , first time , demonstrate HBOT induce neuroplasticity patient chronic neurologic deficiency due stroke . The beneficial effect HBOT mostly territories brain SPECT/CT mismatch .</detailed_description>
