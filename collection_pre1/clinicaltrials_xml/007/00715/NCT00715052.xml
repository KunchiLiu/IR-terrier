	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) major cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Due improvement emergency medical care , transportation specialize trauma facility , number people survive TBI impairment significantly increase recent year . The long term cognitive sequela , often visible persist far beyond resolution obvious physical disability . This combine relatively low awareness general public designate TBI `` silent epidemic '' ( TBI CDC 2006 ) . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) suggest possible treatment modality case preliminary study promise . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness HBOT treatment chronic mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . Sequential SPECT scan brain neurocognitive testing use evaluate cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) response , cognitive functional improvement follow treatment . Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) Traumatic brain injury major cause morbidity mortality lead major long term consequence personal national level estimate 5.3 million Americans suffer permanent TBI related disability ( 24 ) .The prevalence traumatic brain injury United States estimate approximately 1.5 million individual per year ( 24,25 ) . This however include individual receive care facility include national surveillance system receive medical care thus probably significantly underestimate actual number TBI victim . The 2006 NIH consensus state prevalence 2.5 - 6 million people per year suffer form TBI ( 23 ) . Due improvement emergency medical care , transportation specialize trauma facility , number people survive TBI impairment significantly increase recent year . The long term consequence TBI vast , affect large number people substantial effect patient , family society whole . These injury also impart significant economic burden involve , personally society . Approximately 80,000 - 90,000 individual suffer long term disability annually , estimate cost include direct medical care indirect expense lose earn potential 60 million dollar 2001 US ( 28 ) . The long term sequela TBI may include impairment individual physical , cognitive psychosocial functioning . The neurological consequence numerous complex affect various site function . Sensory , motor autonomic system may affect symptom may include headache , seizure , visual defect , movement disorder sleep disorder . The cognitive consequence likewise broad vary . Amongst symptoms commonly noted memory deficit problem attention concentration . There may impair executive function , problem solve ability language difficulty well problem plan , information processing , judgment insight . While symptom may apparent immediately injury , others may present day , week month initial trauma ( Kushner,24 ) . Moreover , vast fluctuation change severity presentation time . Another realm difficulty result TBI include behavioral , emotional psychological impairment . There vast personality change include loss decrease ability initiate response activity , disinhibition , impulsivity , aggressive behavior - verbal physical , change sexual behavior . Personality mood disorder may appear depression , anxiety change emotional control often note TBI . ( 23 ) The social consequence may also widespread often devastate . There increased incidence divorce , chronic unemployment , suicide substance abuse follow TBI . Even chronic stage patient recovery stage , increase demand place workplace upon undertake new task may uncover problem executive function plan ability yet unnoticed . These problem burden care individual long term basis place cumulative strain family support network . Family member care giver report increase occurrence depression , anger social isolation . These combine result disrupt family function relationship problem may persist worsen time . ( 24 ) HBO TBI Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy ( HBOT ) use since 1930 's initially use decompression sickness . Shortly thereafter physician start usingHBOT variety condition . The use HBOT neurological indication start early 1960s work Smith et al show protective effect cerebral ischemia Saltzman show effectiveness stroke patient . ( Jain ) HBOT inhalation 100 % oxygen pressure exceed 1 atmosphere absolute ( ATA ) order enhance amount oxygen dissolve blood body fluid , thereby allow increase oxygen delivery tissue . The mechanism HBOT think improve outcome brain injury multifaceted . The Neubauer Walker ( 2000 ) theory postulate HBOT improve cerebral metabolism improve function dormant neuron stimulate axonal growth ( 10 ) . Zhang et al suggest potential target oxygen therapy include prevention apoptosis , inhibition neuroinflammation BBB damage ( Zhang pathophysiology 2005 , Rossignol ) . There stimulation angiogenesis neovascularization , well direct effect blood vessel brain , maintenance BBB integrity . ( 1 ( ( 5-12 ) ) ,20 ) . Similarly , SPECT scan demonstrate positive effect cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) damage brain follow HBOT ( 2,8,10,16,19,17 , neubauer HBOT close head,20 , ) . HBOT also bring improved neurocognitive functioning patient suffer chronic brain injury . ( 14,9,6,13,20,21 ) . Under normobaric condition , amount oxygen dissolve blood 0.3 ml/dl . At 1.5 ATA amount increase 10 fold 3.2 ml/dl . Using animal model brain injured mouse Daughrty et al ( rockswall 9 ) find 250 % increase local brain tissue oxygen level 100 % oxygen administer 1 ATA ( 103 mmHg ) oppose give 1.5 ATA ( 247 mmHg ) . This seem suggest dissolve O2 readily available brain tissue hemoglobin bound oxygen ( 20 ) . Additionally , work several investigator seem indicate HBOT allow efficient use baseline oxygen level injure brain tissue follow treatment , turn lead positive persistent affect tissue ( 20 ) . It theorize follow brain injury cause , area `` idling neuron '' ischemic penumbra zone still viable potentially salvageable give right treatment . This area consist dormant neuron area dead tissue unaffected healthy tissue surround . . ( 2,16,17,18,19 , jain,22 ) . There appear sufficient oxygen available cell maintain cell life ion pump mechanism , enough generate action potential allow act functioning neuron ( 17,19 ) . The hyperoxia HBOT cause vasoconstriction cerebral blood vessel show cause decrease brain edema ICP ( 11,13,6,7,12 fr rockswald ) . This vasoconstriction appear harmful affect brain tissue due greatly increase oxygen availability tissue . There also beneficial effect effect BBB , evidence reduce post ischemic BBB permeability defect ( jaine , veltkamp , rockswald 52,55,63 ) . There well document animal model TBI grow body literature use HBOT animal model verify state hypothesis finding . Sun et al demonstrate improved penumbral oxygenation follow HBO treatment focal ischemia use animal model measure extrinsic intrinsic marker hypoxia ( SUN ) . Harch et al use rat model TBI evaluate HBO effect spatial learn memory , well 's affect blood vessel density . After receive unilateral cortical contusion , Long-Evans rat test Morris Water Task ( MWT ) 31-33 day post injury . The rat divide untreated control group , sham-treated normobaric air group HBO group receive 80 bid treatment HBO 1.5 ATA/90 min . The rat subsequently retested MWT euthanized . Blood vessel density measure bilaterally hippocampus correlate MWT performance . The HBOT cause significant increase hippocampal vascular density ( p &lt; 0.001 ) associate significant improvement spatial learning ( p &lt; 0.001 ) compare control group . Similarly , increase vascular density improve MWT HBOT group highly correlate ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . ( 11 ) SPECT investigation follow Single photon emission CT ( SPECT ) scan found effective evaluate post traumatic lesion mTBI patient useful mean follow recovery . In prospective study evaluate usefulness SPECT scan diagnosis patient mTBI 's correlation common clinical symptom post concussion syndrome ( PCS ) , post traumatic amnesia ( PTA ) loss consciousness ( LOC ) , Gawda et al find perfusion abnormality 63 % patient . This opposed positive CT finding 34 % patient . In adult , frontal lobe commonly affect whereas temporal lobe likely involved child . The SPECT scan find sensitive CT patient present LOC , PTA PCS ( 14 ) . Jacobs et al evaluate predictive value SPECT scan clinical outcome 136 mTBI patient prospective study . None patient abnormal finding CT. All patient underwent initial SPECT scan CT scan within 4 wks trauma . Follow evaluation perform 3 , 6 , 12 month post injury . All patient abnormal SPECT study deteriorate clinical finding follow SPECT scan perform subsequent time evaluation . The initial SPECT positive 54 % patient gradual decrease number positive scan time . The clinical normalization occur rapidly normalization image study . The SPECT show high sensitivity negative predictive value 3 month post injury onward negative early SPECT reliable criterion exclusion clinical sequela . A positive initial SPECT scan exclude positive clinical outcome , however , positive SPECT scan 12 month post injury reliable predictor clinical outcome ( 13 ) . Golden et al show improved blood flow measure sequential SPECT study 50 patient chronic neurological disorder ( 10 ) . SHI Xiao -yan present large study 310 patient effect HBOT CBF well usefulness SPECT diagnosis assessment neurocognitive disorder follow TBI examine . Pre post treatment scan compare percent positive initial SPECT scan substantially high find CT alone ( 81.3 % vs. 15.2 % ) . Following HBOT 63.5 % SPECT scan normalize concomitant mark improvement clinical symptom headache , dizziness , poor concentration poor memory . An additional 36.5 % initial positive SPECT scan show 33-66 % improvement CBF along clinical improvement well . Proposed Study Design Sixty consent TBI patient age least one year post injury stable cognitive deficit recruit . Any patient previous neurological deficit , head trauma substance abuse exclude well anyone contraindication HBOT . All patient trustee sign write informed consent inclusion study protocol approve local Helsinki committee . Patients exclude one follow criterion : 1 . Had treat HBOT indiction prior inclusion . 2 . Have indication HBOT 3 . Chest pathology incompatible pressure change 4 . Inner ear disease 5 . Patients suffer claustrophobia . 6 . Inability give write informed consent patient trustee . A complete history include medical concurrent medication record . Patients undergo evaluation activity daily live ( ADL ) , physical examination , neurocognitive test SPECT scan perform baseline . Mild traumatic brain injury define accord 1993 American Congress Rehabilitation Medicine definition head trauma loss consciousness last less 30 minute , Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) score 13 , posttraumatic amnesia last less 24 hour . ( Kay et al ) . The patient randomly assign two group . Group I initially receive 40 consecutive HBOT treatment Group II HBOT treatment . At end first phase approximately two month , group revaluated second SPECT scan neurocognitive testing . There cross two group Group II ( previously none treat ) receive HBOT treatment Group I ( previously treat ) receive treatment . Again end second phase follow SPECT scan neurocognitive test group . Additionally end phase detail questioner assess adverse effect evaluate change ADL . There evaluation result first phase comparing difference treat non treat group well allow evaluation spontaneous change occur non treat group due passage time learn curve cognitive evaluation . Following completion second phase another evaluation result compare effect HBOT Group II compare baseline well evaluate whether effect see Group I maintain two month treatment . The HBOT treatment consist 40 consecutive one hour treatment 1.5 ATA 100 % O2 either multiplace monoplace unit per patient preference . The treatment give daily five time week . Cognitive evaluation Statistical analysis This pilot randomize crossover study . The sample size 30 patient subgroup ( total 60 patient ) post ischemic stroke well post hemorrhagic stroke determine order achieve 90 % power base follow assumption relate expected change neurologic evaluation : mean difference group least 25 % drop rate 16 % alpha 5 % cross match period . Statistical analysis perform use statistical software SPSS-version 13 . Parametric data express mean ± standard deviation compare one way ANOVA . Non-parametric data compare use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Differences result yield p value less 0.05 ( p &lt; 0.05 ) consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
