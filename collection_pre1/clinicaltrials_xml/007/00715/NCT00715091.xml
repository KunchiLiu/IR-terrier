	<detailed_description>Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) common chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease prevalence 0.5 % . First symptom normally occur young adulthood . Early course , AS dominate chronic pain , fatigue morning stiffness , later ankylosis loss function . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha block agent drug proven efficacy sign symptom . It clear , however , whether drug also capable retard stop structural damage , i.e . prevention bony ankylosis . Earlier investigation indicate NSAIDs , addition anti-inflammatory , also anti-osteoproliferative effect . In study investigate whether treatment 150 mg diclofenac , non-selective NSAID , daily basis ( continuous treatment ) 2 year capable slow development bony ankylosis compare treatment 75-150mg diclofenac need accord clinical symptom ( on-demand treatment ) . In national multi-centre randomize trial patient symptomatic AS indication NSAID therapy enrol 40 centre . The primary outcome parameter proportion patient radiographic progression spine 2 year treatment arm . If continuous NSAID treatment result less radiographic progression compare on-demand treatment , true disease modify effect NSAID assume likely change place NSAID treatment AS .</detailed_description>
