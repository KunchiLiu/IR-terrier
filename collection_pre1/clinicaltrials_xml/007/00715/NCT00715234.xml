In way , able determine degree reminder/recall successful adolescent , also identify impediment success , provide foundation future effort . Our study also investigate cost establish operate reminder/recall system adolescent type clinical setting . Major Hypotheses 1 . Reminder/recall adolescent result increase rate receipt immunization private setting approximately 10 percentage point 2 . Reminder/recall result great rate receipt immunization patient public setting access school-based health center ( SBHC ) compare access SBHC 3 . Reminder/recall originate SBHC site result high efficacy reminder/recall among type clinical site</detailed_description>
