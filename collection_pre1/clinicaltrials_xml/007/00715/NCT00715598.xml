	<brief_title>Cognitive Testing Pain Quality Assessment Scale ( PQAS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , grow number investigator notice curious find summarize research literature pain treatment : Most effective pain treatment show similar effect global pain intensity , despite vast difference patient sample , presume mechanisms action ( e.g. , Collins et al. , 2000 ; Gutierrez-Alvarez , 2007 ; Wiffen et al. , 2005 ) . As list available treatment various pain condition grows , extent global measure pain used ass outcome , become increasingly difficult one treatment stand others ; understand might choose treatment management one patient 's pain problem . One way well understand treatment differ determine effect treatment pain quality . That , determine treatment A effective `` ache '' `` deep '' pain treatment B , might effective `` electrical '' `` surface '' pain treatment A . By systematically measure effect pain treatment different pain quality , becomes possible begin distinguish effect different treatment one another . To require investigator include measure pain quality secondary outcome measure clinical trial . The NPS PQAS ( include 10 NPS item ) increasingly use clinical trial detect effect pain treatment pain quality . Moreover , grow body research support validity measure identify specific pain quality impact different pain treatment . However , entirely clear either measure could use make label claim . The recent draft FDA 's guidance industry patient-reported outcome specifies number criterion measure must meet order able use make label claim . Although NPS PQAS meet many requirement , meet three critical one . First , guideline specify measure ' item need generate patient involvement . The NPS PQAS item generate ( 1 ) clinical experience measure ' author ( 2 ) review literature concern pain quality often identify patient various chronic pain condition . However , item yet directly check use patient input ( clarify item reflect important common pain quality domain ) . Second , guideline specify patient interview help determine readability understanding item . These interview analyze , action take delete modify item accordance interview . Finally , FDA recommend instrument development process include `` â€¦ generation user manual specifies incorporate measure clinical trial way minimize administrator burden , patient burden , miss data , poor data quality . '' To date , manual write NPS PQAS . To address concern , current proposal seek address limitation PQAS ( PQAS incorporate NPS item , would also address limitation NPS ) perform cognitive test PQAS instruction item two sample patient chronic pain , modify PQAS/NPS need , write manual PQAS/NPS . The procedure would allow critical testing improvement PQAS NPS , make measure even useful understanding impact different pain treatment . In way , measure could even useful already identify unique advantage new , already develop , pain treatment .</detailed_description>
