	<detailed_description>GSK Biologicals develop meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( GSK134612 ) . This candidate vaccine show well tolerate immunogenic subject 12 month age . The purpose study evaluate antibody persistence approximately 1 year , 3 year 5 year post-administration one dose GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Biologicals ' meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 compare Menactra® ( meningococcal serogroups A , C , W-135 Y-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine , sanofi pasteur ) give healthy adolescents/ adult 11 25 year age In addition , safety immunogenicity booster dose GSK134612 administer eligible subject 5 year primary vaccination evaluate . Another cohort subject ( naïve control group ) 15 &lt; 31 year age offer dose MenACWY-TT vaccine time allow evaluation primary ( naïve control group ) booster dose within study .
