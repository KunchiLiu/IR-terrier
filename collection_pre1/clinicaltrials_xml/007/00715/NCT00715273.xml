	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis condition deposit fat , cholesterol , substance build along inner wall artery ; deposit know plaque . People atherosclerosis risk develop coronary artery disease , plaque build-up occurs artery supply blood heart , carotid artery disease , plaque build-up occurs artery deliver blood neck brain . These condition lead blood clot , heart attack , stroke . Research show people fat content atherosclerotic plaque may higher risk experience heart attack stroke . Treatments atherosclerosis include lifestyle change , medicine , medical procedure surgery . There several medication aid people control cholesterol level , include atorvastatin , medication inhibits production cholesterol ; niacin , B-complex vitamin reduce cholesterol level combination dietary change ; colesevelam , medication inhibits fat absorption . Using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , study evaluate whether medication , alone combination , decrease fat content atherosclerotic plaque within carotid artery people coronary artery disease carotid artery disease . This study enroll people coronary artery disease carotid artery disease . Participants randomly assign one follow 40-month treatment group : - Group 1 participant receive atorvastatin , placebo niacin , placebo colesevelam day . - Group 2 participant receive atorvastatin , niacin , placebo colesevelam day . - Group 3 participant receive atorvastatin , niacin , colesevelam day . At baseline study visit , participant undergo blood collection receive dietary counseling focus lower cholesterol level . They also undergo MRI scan carotid artery . For next 4 month , participant attend monthly study visit repeat blood collection dietary counseling ; subsequent 36 month , participant attend study visit every month . Repeat carotid artery MRI scan occur Months 12 , 24 , 36 . At three different time study , researcher ask participant record food consumption 3 consecutive day .</detailed_description>
