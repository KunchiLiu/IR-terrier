The primary methodology dynamic PET imaging , use three tracer respectively portray kinetics glucose delivery , bi-directional trans-membrane glucose transport glucose phosphorylation . The three tracer : 1 ) [ 15O ] -H2O quantify tissue perfusion , portray kinetics glucose delivery plasma tissue ; 2 ) [ 11C ] -3-O-methyl glucose , tracer constrain bi-directional trans-membrane glucose transport ; 3 ) [ 18F ] -fluoro-deoxy glucose , like [ 11C ] -3-OMG transport , add subsequent metabolic step , glucose phosphorylation . We propose 2 specific aim apply methodology investigate pathogenesis IR . The 1st aim quantitatively assess kinetics glucose delivery , transport phosphorylation skeletal muscle type 2 DM compare obese lean non-diabetic men woman . We appraise contribution step pathogenesis IR . We postulate severe IR oxidative muscle , dual impairment glucose transport phosphorylation . The 2nd aim implement triple-tracer dynamic PET image protocol adipose tissue ( AT ) , examine normal insulin action non-obese volunteer test whether difference AT insulin action present obese insulin sensitive volunteer compare obese IR participant relation AT IR muscle liver .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose clinical investigation pathogenesis insulin resistance ( IR ) skeletal muscle adipose tissue ( AT ) obesity diabetes mellitus , focus separate interactive role glucose delivery , bi-directional trans-membrane glucose transport glucose phosphorylation . The primary methodology dynamic PET imaging , use three tracer respectively portray kinetics glucose delivery , transport phosphorylation . The three tracer : 1 ) [ 15O ] -H2O quantify tissue perfusion , parameter together glucose concentration portrays kinetics glucose delivery plasma tissue interstitial space ; 2 ) [ 11C ] -3-O-methyl glucose , tracer constrain bi-directional trans-membrane glucose transport ; 3 ) [ 18F ] -fluoro-deoxy glucose , like [ 11C ] -3-OMG transport , add subsequent metabolic step , glucose phosphorylation . In recently complete study , implement triple-tracer dynamic PET image protocol investigate insulin action lean , healthy individual 1-3 . Rates glucose uptake obtain method ( e.g . glucose clamp , arterio-venous limb balance ) . What uniquely valuable dynamic PET image acquisition temporal plot tracer uptake , one obtain within organ rather derive plasma determination . These tissue-time activity curve provide information ass velocity metabolic step . By three tracer , assessment make among glucose delivery , transport phosphorylation rate-controlling , properly , rate control distribute amongst step . The triple-tracer procedure provide novel , quantitative insight action insulin change distribution control , re-distribution trigger healthy individual robust activation glucose transport . Robust activation glucose transport increase permeability muscle glucose sufficiently delivery manifest great rate limitation basal condition . Also , couple PET bio-imaging MRI study specific muscle 1 , 3 . This approach yield provocative unanticipated new finding . Unlike lean non-diabetics , oxidative muscle insulin sensitive ( widely demonstrate animal study ) , type 2 type 1 DM , oxidative muscle severely IR . We encourage bio-imaging methodology enable new insight pathogenesis IR skeletal muscle approach successfully adapt vivo investigation adipose tissue metabolism . The 1st specific aim quantitatively assess contribution glucose delivery , transport phosphorylation pathogenesis skeletal muscle IR type 2 DM obesity . The 2nd specific aim implement triple-tracer dynamic PET imaging study insulin action gluteal-femoral adipose tissue ( GF-AT ) non-obese obese woman , investigate among latter group mechanisms IR GF-AT , role GF-AT IR may differentiate obese insulin-sensitive ( OB-InS ) obese insulin-resistant ( OB-IR ) woman . Experiment Synopsis : During past year , pilot study , initiate PET image procedure AT , use [ 18F ] -FDG . We propose full development triple tracer methodology GF-AT . Non-obese obese woman study , latter recruit form group obese insulin-sensitive ( OB-IS ) obese insulin-resistant ( OB-IR ) . Triple-tracer PET image do basal insulin stimulate condition , use infusion rate 20 mU/min-m2 . Complementary assessment include : ) MRI DXA measure quantity fat-mass ( FM ) , GF-AT , abdominal adipose depot ( ABD-SAT VAT ) ; b ) endogenous glucose production ( EGP ) assess use prim , constant infusion [ 6,6 ] d2-glucose ; c ) adipokine profile ; ) needle biopsy GF-AT histological analysis .</detailed_description>
