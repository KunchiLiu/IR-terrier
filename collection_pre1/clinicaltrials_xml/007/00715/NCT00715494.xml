	<brief_summary>Intensive care unit ( ICU ) hospitalization save life often high personal cost ICU survivor frequently experience significant cognitive impairment array physical functional disability limit recovery quality life . While problem experience patient likely amenable rehabilitation , ICU survivor receive focus rehabilitation follow hospital discharge . The purpose study initiate test feasibility complex intervention incorporate cognitive , physical , functional rehabilitation program time hospital discharge implement 12 week program use in-home visit tele-technology . We hypothesize interdisciplinary rehabilitation program , initiated hospital discharge implement use in-home visit tele-technology , result improve recovery neuropsychological physical performance overall functional status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Rehabilitation Among Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) Survivors : RETURN Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term consequence critical illness intensive care unit ( ICU ) hospitalization ICU survivor profound include cognitive , physical , functional impairment . The purpose study pilot test 12-week , home-based rehabilitation program target cognitive functioning physical functioning , determine feasibility rehabilitation program , determine whether participation rehabilitation program result improve outcome among ICU survivor . The study rely randomize controlled clinical trial design , patient assign either `` usual care '' control group vs. treatment group . Individuals treatment group receive protocolized cognitive rehabilitation intervention , well individualized physical functional rehabilitation target ability strength , endurance , balance , functionality basic task daily living . Cognitive , physical , functional rehabilitation intervention deliver patient home take place alternate week 12 week period . Televideo technology employ context intervention , expert Vanderbilt University Duke University medical center provide assistance via video monitor conjunction rehabilitation specialist implement intervention patient home . The study 3 primary outcome include : ( 1 ) . Executive functioning ( e.g . ability plan , organize , multi-task ) time measure Tower Test , psychometric tool evaluate executive ability ; ( 2 ) Physical Impairment , measure Timed Up Go ( TUG ) test ; ( 3 ) Physical Functioning , measure Step Activity Monitor ( SAM ) . These three primary outcome select area primary focus due fact available research point presence significant deficit area among ICU survivor . Secondary outcome include activity daily live ( Katz ADL ) instrumental activity daily live ( Pfeffers FAQ ) , activity specific balance confidence ( ABC Scale ) , health relate quality life ( SF-36 ) , 12-month mortality , rehospitalization rate number rehospitalization day . We measure change outcome measure interest 3 12-month follow determine short term efficacy , along evaluate overall feasibility . The study duration include 1 year protocol development complex intervention 1.5 2 year enrollment .</detailed_description>
