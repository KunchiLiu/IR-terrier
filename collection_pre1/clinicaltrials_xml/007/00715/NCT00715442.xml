	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn Sutent® ( sunitinib malate ) , give surgery , help control renal cell carcinoma . The safety sunitinib malate also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-Surgical Sutent Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Sunitinib malate design block pathway control important event growth blood vessel essential growth cancer . Study Treatment : If find eligible take part study , take sunitinib malate day ( either without food ) 4 week row , follow 2 week rest study drug . These 6 week consider 1 cycle study treatment . During Cycle 2 , surgery remove tumor . You start take sunitinib malate surgery ( least 14 day surgery ) schedule . Study Visits : At begin new cycle ( Cycles 1-6 ) , follow test : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , weight . - You performance status evaluation . - You ask medicine currently take experienced side effect since last visit . - You blood draw ( 4 teaspoon ) routine test . This blood also test check function thyroid gland . - You follow-up scan ( one screen check disease status ) begin Cycle 2 , surgery , begin next 4 cycle . - You ECG measure health heart . Every 2 Cycles , follow-up echocardiogram MUGA scan check heart function , doctor feel need . Beginning Cycle 7 , ask return clinic every cycle ( every 12 week ) , unless doctor think return often . This mean would return clinic visit start Cycles 8 , 10 , 12 , , may ask come back time . At visit , follow test : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You performance status evaluation . - You ask medicine currently take experienced side effect since last visit . - You blood draw ( 4 teaspoon ) routine test begin cycle . If schedule return M. D. Anderson every 2 cycle ( 12 week ) , may blood drawn routine test local doctor 's office `` non-visit '' cycle . - You ECG measure health heart . - You echocardiogram MUGA scan check heart function , doctor feel need . - You follow-up scan ( one screen check disease status ) . Length Study : You continue take sunitinib malate study , unless disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , and/or need alternative treatment course study . Early Withdrawal : Early withdrawal define patient able complete full cycle sunitinib malate . If withdraw early , return clinic follow test : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , weight . - You performance status evaluation . - You blood draw ( 4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine testing . This blood also test check function thyroid gland . - You ECG measure health heart . - You ask medicine currently take experienced side effect since last visit . - You follow-up scan ( one screen check disease status ) . Post Treatment Evaluation ( within 1 month last dose ) : About 30 day last dose sunitinib malate , return clinic follow-up visit . You follow test : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , weight . - You performance status evaluation . - You blood draw ( 4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine testing . This blood also test check function thyroid gland . - You ask medicine currently take experienced side effect since last visit . - You follow-up scan ( screen ) check status disease . - You ECG measure health heart . Long-Term Follow-Up : Following post-treatment visit , contact regularly check status disease . You contact ( telephone routine clinic visit ) every 6-12 week first 2 year , every 6 month 5 year . This investigational study . Sunitinib malate commercially available FDA approve treatment clear-cell renal cell carcinoma . At time , use combination surgery research . Up 50 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
