	<brief_title>Cysteamine Therapy Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) chronic , disable illness affect 17 % general population . Despite advance treatment , two-thirds patient fail respond initial trial pharmacotherapy . Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) neural growth-promoting polypeptide find central nervous system , implicate pathophysiology potential treatment MDD . A multitude study show low level BDNF subject MDD , normalized treatment antidepressant . Traditional antidepressant serotonin reuptake inhibitor may increase BDNF via indirect intracellular pathway . The current study drug , cysteamine bitartrate ( Cystagon ) , FDA approve treatment nephropathic cystinosis show increase BNDF neuronal tissue , stimulate cell growth . Cysteamine already investigate human potential treatment Huntington 's Disease . Given evidence decrease level major depression , subsequent increase post-treatment antidepressant , BDNF may play key role develop novel treatment patient fail conventional agent . Therefore , drug demonstrably increase central BDNF , cysteamine , may significant potential novel antidepressant medication .</detailed_description>
