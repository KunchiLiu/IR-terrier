	<brief_title>Locomotor Training ( Walking Therapy ) Post Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persons ask walk indoors walkway speed fast safely . The walkway measure speed walk size step . Participants use assistive device typically use . A physical therapist walk beside walk across walkway . Participants ask walk several time across walkway distance approximately 20 foot time . If person meet study requirement , schedule test training . We contact physician inform him/her interest participate study study criterion participation . We need receive physician 's write medical approval participation study begin train . Persons first exercise tolerance test make sure safe participate exercise program part study . In exercise test , ask ride stationary bicycle specific speed cardiologist ( doctor specialize test well heart work ) nurse practitioner PhD specialize cardiology monitor heart rate , blood pressure , EKG ( electrical signal produce heart ) . The cardiologist nurse practitioner conduct , supervise , interpret finding exercise tolerance test . Every minute , resistance bicycle increase heart rate rise certain level . The test stop immediately atypical abnormal reaction test . If test stop reason , refer back doctor , able participate study . A therapist research assistant assist bicycle sure comfortable . Clinical Testing . We first evaluate severity stroke effect stroke ability move arm legs . Next test walk speed , balance , strength , much walk typical 4-day period . We repeat clinical test completion training , 6 month finish training . Walking Testing : Persons ask wear short low-heeled walking shoe ( tennis shoe prefer ) . Small , dime-sized light-reflecting marker place head , shoulder , arm , hand , trunk , hip , knee , ankle , foot study assist record position joint move . They may ask muscle activity leg motion record walk overground treadmill . For walk test , may need shave small area legs attach small sensor skin record activity leg muscle . We may also attach small angle measurement device skin hip , knee , ankle joint leg . We film walk video camera . When walking , therapist guard assist necessary . They ask begin walk 1 ) treadmill 2 ) overground comfortable speed fast possible . During treadmill walking , wear harness attach mobile device attach ceiling . This harness use safety prevent fall ( catch lose balance stumble ) . However , support weight walk . If use brace and/or assistive device , may ask walk without , accord comfort safety . A therapist stand beside provide physical assistance may need . Persons may ask pedal stationary bike muscle sensor attach . If , assist sit stationary bike foot secure pedal . A trainer monitor may assist move leg . Persons ask wear small device leg , keep count many step take course day . The device safe , lightweight , small . We show use device go home . This device may take bath sleep need worn 4 day test session . We repeat walk test completion training , 6 month finish training . There also weekly test lab intensive . Metabolic Testing : This test do 2 time , start train session follow completion training session . They ask wear facemask , cover nose mouth , connect portable metabolic unit . A metabolic unit measure oxygen breathe carbon dioxide breathe walking . The metabolic unit also measure respiration rate - many breath take every minute . Their heart rate measure wireless heart monitor walk . Persons may ask wear facemask walk indoor walkway mention . They may also ask wear mask walk six minute . Immediately finish walk may ask show hard feel work walk point chart number 6 20 short phrase light , somewhat hard , etc , next number . This chart explain start walking . Currently metabolic test performed typical inpatient outpatient rehabilitation . Training : Persons train 3 time week 12 week . The training session last hour hour half . Times therapy coordinate trainer , either licensed physical occupational therapist . The therapist monitor heart rate blood pressure train stop therapy session necessary heart rate blood pressure exceed normal limit . Persons may ask many rest break need test training . For treadmill training , wear vest like rock-climbing harness , attach device help support weight . A safety support also attach make sure fall ground . The therapist work help take step treadmill , try help walk close normal possible . Participants also ask walk overground get treadmill . Their walking therapy may include walk different setting ( example , outside inside ) , choose appropriate assistive device , examine need leg brace , train balance endurance , use skill learn treadmill walk overground home community . During overground training , may ask walk across walkway measure speed . Participants may ask answer question feel training ; help , help ; train like ; way improve training . These interview may document write record and/or audiotape record . Also , train session may observe person may make note train go , therapist ( ) work important comment trainer make training session .</detailed_description>
