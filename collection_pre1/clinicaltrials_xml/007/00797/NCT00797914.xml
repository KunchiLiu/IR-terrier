	<brief_title>Evaluation Handheld Colonoscopy Force Monitor Expert Endoscopists Performance Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy require skilled endoscopist use visual tactile information advance withdraw instrument series fix stationary loop . To develop maintain skill necessary perform colonoscopy safely effectively require extensive training ongoing education . Quantification tactile information provide opportunity understand `` feel '' use endoscopist perform colonoscopy . The identification force application pattern potential enhance training improve performance . CFM™ handheld device us load cell transform apply force electric signal transmit wirelessly signal computer storage visual display . The device design endoscopist maintains conventional hand position use electronically control grip release mechanism fix position instrument . Several expert endoscopists multiple institution use CFM™ perform colonoscopy . The data record analyzed difference patient characteristic ( e.g . gender , age , pain sensation , surgical history ) endoscopist .</detailed_description>
