	<brief_summary>SCH 900518 potent oral inhibitor HCV NS3 protease disrupts hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) polyprotein processing . SCH 900518 , add current standard care ( SOC ) , peginterferon-alfa plus ribavirin , would likely increase proportion patient achieve undetectable HCV-RNA level sustain virologic response ( SVR ) . In study , SCH 900518 would use combination low dos ritonavir enhance level SCH 900518 within body reduce number daily SCH 900518 tablet require . The purpose study identify optimal dose schedule ( twice day ) SCH 900518 plus ritonavir previously untreated patient genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C give combination SOC . The study compare SOC 6 experimental arm . In experimental arm , SOC plus SCH 900518 dose 200 , 400 600 mg daily 100 mg twice daily ritonavir 100 mg twice daily explore . The benefit 4 week lead-in PegIntron ribavirin prior addition SCH 900518 also explore .</brief_summary>
