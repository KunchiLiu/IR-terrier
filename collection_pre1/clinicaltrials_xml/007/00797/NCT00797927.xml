	<brief_title>Quetiapine Related Neurochemical Changes Measured Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The impact medication MRS change brain schizophrenia patient rarely study well-controlled study . Most MRS study schizophrenia patient cross-sectional uncontrolled devoid comparison effect different drug . To date , limited research explore issue result conflict . These conflict result may relate small sample size , different patient population design study . Thus , study warrant . Besides , advent new generation atypical antipsychotic , important know whether atypical antipsychotic exert different effect neuron conventional antipsychotic . If neuronal activity improve atypical antipsychotic , finding great clinical implication . Fifteen patient experimental group receive MRS examination ( include bilateral frontal temporal area ) two phase : baseline ( conventional antipsychotic ) 4 week shift conventional antipsychotic quetiapine . Another 15 schizophrenia patient receive conventional antipsychotic serve control group . The control group receive MRS examination twice ( baseline 4 week later ) without change medication . In phase , every patient also receive Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) assessment . The change MRS marker analyze compare , within 2 group , correlation PANSS score explore .</detailed_description>
