	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety MK-0518 Treatment-Experienced HIV-1 Infected Adult Patients With Hemophilia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Objective To assess safety , tolerability efficacy MK-0518 compare placebo combine antiretroviral drug , treatment-experienced HIV-infected patient hemophilia . 2 . Background Significance Current anti-HIV drug mainly reverse transcriptase inhibitor , include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) , protease inhibitor ( PIs ) . However , HIV become rapidly resistant due high rate mutation replicating , force people seek new target anti-HIV therapy continually . Integrase another enzyme essential HIV reproduction . To inhibit integrase activity effective measure suppress HIV replication . MK-0518 ( Raltegravir）was approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) October 12th 2007 due potent antiviral activity become first-to-market integrase inhibitor.Compared antiviral drug , new action mechanism target site , cross resistance , make good option patient multi-drug resistant HIV strain . HIV infection common hemophiliac patient need continuous infusion clotting product , chance get HIV infection hemophilia patient high , especially 1985 non-virus-inactivated factor concentrate widely use . Many hemophilia patient infected HIV , AIDS become main cause death.The recommend first-line antiretroviral regimen HIV/AIDS patient hemophilia concludes two NRTIs one NNRTIs , protease inhibitor recommend use patient , likely worsen bleed tendency . So , HIV/AIDS patient hemophilia resistant NRTIs NNRTIs , remain option choose part second-line drug . However , MK-0518，a drug novel anti-HIV mechanism different NRTIs NNRTIs , may use HIV/AIDS patient hemophilia second-line drug . 3． Study design 1 . Patients Enrollment 2 . Patients enrol study sign consent form 3 . Select optimized background therapy ( OBT ) subject 4 . Randomization : patient randomly assign MK-0518 400 mg twice daily plus OBT group placebo plus OBT group , group conclude least 50 subject . 5 . Data collection : patient , detection HIV viral load CD4+ T lymphocyte count do screening , weeks4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 . The safety profile MK-0518 monitor accord patient ' complaint result physical laboratory examination . 6 . Endpoints study : The primary endpoint safety tolerability MK-0518 400 mg b.i.d . compare placebo , combination OBT.The secondary endpoint antiretroviral activity MK-0518 400 mg b.i.d . compare placebo , combination OBT .</detailed_description>
