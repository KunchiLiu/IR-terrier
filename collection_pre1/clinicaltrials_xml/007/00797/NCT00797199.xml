	<brief_summary>Hormone Replacement Therapy ( HRT ) double edge sword : alleviate effect menopause significant proportion female population , however small proportion , induce significant increase short-term lifetime risk develop breast cancer ( BC ) . Fewer woman prescribe HRT compare decade ago due concern pertain BC physicians patient . By develop technology could identify woman risk adverse effect HRT , first month use , physician may offer HRT wide proportion female population menopause . More importantly , relate BC prevention , technology identify woman risk provide useful decision make tool regard care menopausal year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring Breast Tissue Change Due Hormone Replacement Therapy Post-menopausal Women Using OBS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hormone Replacement Therapy ( HRT ) provide many benefit post-menopausal woman , overshadow increase breast cancer woman follow HRT , result negative HRT cost-benefit ratio . Epidemiological study show evidence direct association HRT use breast cancer incidence . This increase incidence also reflect increase mammographic breast density ( MBD ) . Endogenous MBD well establish risk factor breast cancer provide high odds ratio ( OR 4 - 6 ) towards breast cancer . Increases MBD report woman initiate HRT , concern potentially indicate great adverse effect HRT individual . In case , majority incremental MBD increase manifest first year use decrease case therapy cessation . The ability detect change MBD woman commence HRT treatment , without ionize radiation dose penalty imparted mammography , thus permit improve monitoring MBD change de HRT , would certainly impact debate applicability HRT . Women identify increase MBD induce HRT discontinue use modify prescription increase MBD potentially indicate adverse ratio ; woman whose MBD adversely affect HRT continue use reap benefit HRT ( e.g . relief climacteric symptom , beneficial effect osteoporosis coronary heart disease ) . Optical Breast Spectroscopy ( OBS ) safe non-invasive optical technique provide information breast tissue composition physiology state . Comparison breast tissue status time provide information change MBD breast cancer risk due intervention HRT . To demonstrate breast tissue status change HRT use , exploit exist algorithm correlate OBS various biological outcome . A complete study cohort 300 healthy woman ( age 38 72 ) show high correlation OBS optical parameter Cumulus derive MBD . An ongoing study , complete Q3 2008 interim analysis available , suggest OBS parameter optically detect difference contralateral breast woman unilateral carcinoma ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) healthy control . Through study , two OBS algorithm ( `` density '' `` risk '' ) available application propose study . The algorithms take OBS optical data input output OBS-derived percent breast density ( PBD ) OBS-derived risk value . The aim study examine change OBS-derived PBD OBS-derived risk value due initiation , use cessation HRT 1 year period . The case group comprise population post-menopausal woman elect undergo HRT regiment design last least 1 year prior HRT treatment . The comparison group ( control ) comprise post-menopausal woman HRT prior HRT treatment . OBS measurement assess interval correspond : baseline ( pre-HRT ) , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year initiation HRT use , 3 month cessation treatment ( case HRT discontinue within one year ) . Blood collect baseline 3 month treatment examine change circulate hormone ( estrogen , progesterone ) . Mammography perform three month treatment compare screen mammogram ( take within year prior HRT treatment ) determine change breast density . A Papanicolaou test ( PAP smear ) perform baseline assess endometrial change . Changes OBS derive PBD MBD well pertinent risk value examine function time . Four model group monitor consist case receive treatment Premarin , Premarin + Provera combination , Premarin + Prometrium combination control HRT . A total 20 woman recruit group four group . While total number woman intend recruitment small , sufficient enable u demonstrate OBS change function MBD change . Of interest , want determine whether OBS detect change prior change MBD standard clinical setting . In particular , aim determine magnitude effect size variance within study group later initiation large definitive clinical monitoring trail HRT effect OBS . The long term clinical goal identification woman adversely affect HRT OBS advise alternative method possible low risk benefit ratio relieve climacteric symptom . An overall effect reduction population-based incidence breast cancer withhold beneficial effect HRT majority woman menopause .</detailed_description>
