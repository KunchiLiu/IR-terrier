	<brief_summary>This protocol focus development noninvasive method early coronary artery disease detection diabetes . The overall hypothesis risk factor metabolic syndrome predict invasive finding intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) noninvasive finding cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) perfusion image . Secondary objective include demonstrate relative importance individual risk factor early disease , demonstrate positive effect aggressive risk factor modification disease , demonstrate relative importance treatment individual risk factor disease progression stabilization , invasive finding IVUS predict noninvasive finding CMR . Such technique may allow earlier noninvasive detection disease well tailor treatment early disease process make prevention cost effective . The specific aim proposal follow : 1 . To assess whether risk factor coronary artery disease , know novel , predict quantitative qualitative plaque characteristic IVUS alteration myocardial blood flow CMR . 2 . To assess whether improvement risk factor aggressive treatment improve microvascular function measure CMR plaque stabilization and/or regression measure IVUS . 3 . To assess risk factor predictive early disease demonstrate risk factor , treat , provide benefit . 4 . To assess whether finding CMR predict finding IVUS , thus , provide noninvasive method early disease detection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type II Diabetes become epidemic United States . Cardiovascular disease common cause death population two four fold high general population . This increase risk least partially attributable high prevalence metabolic syndrome multiple coronary heart disease risk factor include central obesity , hypertension , glucose intolerance , chronic inflammation , dyslipidemia . However , recent trial demonstrate traditional risk factor alone completely predictive disease burden particularly early disease process prior development flow-limiting coronary stenosis . Diagnosis prevention cardiovascular disease development , thus , elusive high risk population . It entirely clear factor , know novel , contribute early disease therapy may beneficial . It suggest microvascular dysfunction , composite endothelial dysfunction , abnormal blood cell rheology , abnormal blood viscosity , precedes development overt coronary stenosis contributes increase cardiovascular risk early disease development . Microvascular reactivity affect many aspect metabolic syndrome . Commonly used tool may adequate evaluate microvascular function heart baseline response therapy . Myocardial contrast echocardiography ( MCE ) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) provide noninvasive technology capable directly measure microvascular function within heart . Our preliminary data modality show significantly reduce microvascular function diabetes absence distinct coronary stenosis . Prior development stenosis coronary artery , plaque accumulates via positive remodel preserve lumen . This detect invasively use intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) . Coronary CT potential noninvasive modality able assess early remodel process , require substantial radiation dose iodinate contrast dye . In addition , CT require calcification occur within plaque , find believe occur well life plaque . It unclear early plaque development relate microvascular function stabilization regression plaque available therapy improve microvascular function . The overall hypothesis risk factor metabolic syndrome predict invasive finding IVUS noninvasive finding CMR perfusion image . Secondary objective include demonstrate relative importance individual risk factor early disease , demonstrate positive effect aggressive risk factor modification disease , demonstrate relative importance treatment individual risk factor disease progression stabilization , invasive finding IVUS predict noninvasive finding CMR . Such technique may allow earlier noninvasive detection disease well tailor treatment early disease process make prevention cost effective . The specific aim proposal follow : 1 . To assess whether risk factor coronary artery disease , know novel , predict quantitative qualitative plaque characteristic IVUS alteration myocardial blood flow CMR . This accomplish perform IVUS cardiac catheterization follow CMR perfusion image subject baseline . Risk factor assess follow method : history , physical exam , laboratory test . As CMR ability detect global dysfunction , oppose current commonly use noninvasive technique , hypothesis risk factor cardiovascular disease predict finding IVUS well CMR . 2 . To assess whether improvement risk factor aggressive treatment improve microvascular function measure CMR plaque stabilization and/or regression measure IVUS . Subjects treat aggressively accord current American College Cardiology American Diabetes Association recommendation Diabetes Cardiovascular Clinic reassess one year . The hypothesis improvement risk factor predict improvement measurement IVUS MRI . 3 . To assess risk factor predictive early disease demonstrate risk factor , treat , provide benefit . As metabolic syndrome present many 10 year prior development diabetes , hypothesis risk factor associate directly metabolic syndrome predictive disease disease improvement . 4 . To assess whether finding CMR predict finding IVUS , thus , provide noninvasive method early disease detection . The hypothesis MRI predict finding IVUS , provide novel noninvasive mechanism direct detection early coronary artery disease .</detailed_description>
