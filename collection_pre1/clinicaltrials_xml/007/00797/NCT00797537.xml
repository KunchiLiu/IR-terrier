	<detailed_description>Osteo-articular echography currently recognize important development among rheumatologist . Chondrocalcinosis , promote joint inflammation cartilage degeneration , highly prevalent elderly subject . Osteo-articular echography currently reconized important development among rheumatologist efficiently use detect Chondrocalcinosis . The aim study find correlation radiography echography detect CPPD crystal deposition , sample patient important new generation ultrasound probe superficial performance . 166 patient enrolled trial echography radiography 2 knee ( front profile ) do patient . Ih echography show calcification , exams wrist , hip shoulder echography conduct . In case liquid epanchement , analysis liquid carry order eliminate differential diagnostic include septic arthritis</detailed_description>
