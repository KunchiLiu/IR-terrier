	<brief_summary>Malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPMs ) tumour associate asbestos exposure involve tissue line surround lung . Radiation therapy ( RT ) dramatically reduce risk tumour recurrence within irradiated area ( &gt; 90 % ) . But patient continue succumb MPMs due tumour spread outside chest cavity . This may due tumour cell inadvertently contaminate area outside chest cavity surgery . The study look whether give short intense course chest radiation prior surgery sterilize tumour cell thus , avoid reduce contamination area outside chest cavity . The investigator hypothesize short neoadjuvant ( pre-operative ) hemithoracic RT , follow immediate plan extrapleural pneumonectomy ( EPP ) ( +/- adjuvant chemotherapy ) reduce risk intra-operative seeding reduce incidence distant metastatic disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study phase I/II prospective single cohort clinical feasibility study . 100 patient early stage resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma enrol study . Patients baseline PET scan . Patients study receive IMRT approximately 1 week 5 daily treatment . 1 week post-RT , proceed extrapleural pneumonectomy . If mediastinal lymph node remove surgery positive tumour cell , 3 cycle chemotherapy , consist raltitrexed cisplatin OR Pemetrexed cisplatin , give 6-12 week post-surgery . Before treatment , side effect assess . After treatment , follow visit conduct every 1 2 month first year , every 3 month second year . At visit , history physical examination perform ECOG performance status assess . Routine test include CBC , liver profile , creatinine chest x-ray . CT thorax abdomen do 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month . Additional test may do discretion oncologist patient become symptomatic . The study evaluate feasibility safety short pre-operative RT , may help confirm intraoperative seed hypothesis . Preoperative RT may also reduce risk local distant spread , ultimately , improve overall survival . By shorten overall treatment time , may also improve patient compliance convenience . We may able give chemotherapy patient high risk avoid others .</detailed_description>

Suitable combined modality therapy Informed consent Distant metastatic disease Previous thoracic irradiation Serious nonmalignant disease ( e.g . cardiovascular , pulmonary , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , scleroderma ) would preclude definitive radiation treatment Previous chemotherapy concurrent malignancy Previous concomitant malignancy except patient nonmelanoma skin cancer , contralateral noninvasive breast cancer , prostate cancer treat curative intent carcinoma situ site .
