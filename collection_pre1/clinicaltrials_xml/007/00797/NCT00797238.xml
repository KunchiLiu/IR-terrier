	<brief_summary>The studied material contain surgically specimens two group patiens non-small cell lung cancer receive two regimen induction ( neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy tumor resection . Pathological specimen pre-chemotherapy post-chemotherapy whatever retrievable collect . The protein ad RNA expression DNA repair gene ( ERCC1 , ERCC2 , XRCC1 , XRCC3 , BRCA1 RRM1 ) well DNA polymorphism gene study , correlate treatment response outcome patient . The aim study include : 1 . To identify expression status DNA repair gene Taiwanese NSCLC patient . 2 . To correlate expression , well DNA polymorphism DNA repair gene treatment response two differenct chemotherapeutic regimen . 3 . To correlate expression , well DNA polymorphism DNA repair gene outcome stage III NSCLC patient . 4 . To explore whether platinum base chemotherapy change expression status DNA repair gene indeed change , whether would influence outcome patient</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DNA Repair Genes Outcomes Patients With Stage III NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients clinical stage IIIA N2 non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) 5-year survival rate 10 % 15 % , much bad earlier stage disease . The use pre-operative ( neo-adjuvant ) chemotherapy show beneficial several studies.1 However , precise chemotherapeutic regimen neoadjuvant therapy remain open question . The treatment response toxicity chemotherapy vary widely among within individual , race . Recently , molecular predictive marker may help identify may benefit individual therapy . Many evidence show level ERCC1 ( excision nuclease within nucleotide excision repair pathway ) important repair platinum-DNA adduct response platinum-based chemotherapy.2-5 Not measure protein mRNA expression , study address polymorphism ERCC1 ( 118 C/T C8092A ) demonstrate impact survival chemotherapy-treated NSCLC patients6,7 . XPD/ERCC2 ( xeroderma pigmentosum group D/excision repair cross-complementing group 2 ) 8 , XRCC1 ( X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 ) XRCC3 ( X-ray repair cross-complementing group 3 ) another three protein involve NER , serve prognostic factor survival.9 BRCA1 protein participate recombinant repair ( RR ) stronge predictive marker chemotherapy response . BRCA1 function differential modulator survival cisplatin antimicrotubule drug ( paclitaxel , docetaxel vinorelbine ) . Low level BRCA1 enhance cisplatin activity lead resistance paclitaxel , docetaxel vinorelbine , whereas opposite phenomenon observe presence normal high level BRCA1 . In contract , BRCA1 level influence effect gemcitabine10 . On contrary , RRM1 ( ribonucleotid reductase subunit M1 ) involve gemcitabine metabolism DNA repair chemotherapy damage , increase RRM1 mRNA expression relate gemcitabine resistance NSCLC11 . All DNA repair gene participate pathogenesis , mechanism chemotherapeutic resistance outcome lung cancer patient . Previously , joint study do NTUH VGH Taipei use gemcitabine cisplatin induction chemotherapy treat 52 patient stage III NSCLC , 36 operable 18 completely resected.12 From 2004 till , prospective study perform NTUH use docetaxel cisplatin neoadjuvant regimen treat patient stage IIIA ( N2 ) non-small cell lung cancer . Up , 40 patient enrol , receive tumor sample chemotherapy 90 % received operation tumor resect . The tissue specimens valuable patient receive protocolized treatment , file detailed clinical information collect systematically . All peroperative biopsied operatively resected tumor tissue available paffin-embedded block , frozen tissue stock , plan study DNA polymorphism , protein RNA expression above-mentioned DNA repair gene two series patient .</detailed_description>
