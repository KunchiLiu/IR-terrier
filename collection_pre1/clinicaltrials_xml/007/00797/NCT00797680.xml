	<brief_summary>In study , child survive cardiac arrest evaluate whether 24 72 hour whole body hypothermia ( cool ) recovery good help prevent brain injury improve outcome . The investigator also test safety cooling patient 24 72 hour . The investigator hypothesize 72 hour cool beneficial 24 hour without compromise safety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cooling show decrease amount brain injury occur heart attack adults newborn baby birth asphyxia ( lack blood flow oxygen fetus ) . It unknown cool effective child cardiac arrest . However , cool recommended American Heart Association `` consideration '' use child cardiac arrest prevent brain injury use doctor intensive care unit since 2002 . Children randomly assign receive either 24 72 hour cool compare result 1 ) blood-and urine derive marker brain injury , 2 ) brain magnetic resonance image spectroscopy ( MRI MRS ) , measure anatomy chemical pattern brain without use ionize radiation , two group patient 24 72 hour cool . We also evaluate cool effect patient outcome quality life 6 month one year use telephone mail questionnaire . A child may take part research study cardiac arrest , receive help breathe chest compression get spontaneous heart rate health care worker , remain unconscious intensive care unit ( ICU ) . The attend physician ICU already decide cool child provide protection brain function . Children invite participate study also 1 week 17 year age , access tube already place artery vein blood draw , urine catheter , able undergo MRI MRS brain scan , , female , pregnant . Patients acute brain injury cause ( ex. , meningitis , trauma ) , hemorrhage ( excess bleed site ) , congenital heart disease , resuscitate status , undergo brain death examination , know coagulation defect make bleed easily . The study perform total 40 child strictly hospital .</detailed_description>
