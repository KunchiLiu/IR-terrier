	<brief_summary>The purpose research improve understand molecular functional property human olfactory system . The specific aim : - determine location AC3 Golf proteins human olfactory epithelium freshly harvest nasal/sinus tissue surgical patient - perform objective functional study fresh human nasal/sinus tissue use electro-olfactogram ( EOG ) whic measure electrical activity olfactory sensory neuron fresh biopsied tissue response odor pheromone stimulation . An organotypic culture system human tissue establish optimize electrical signal acquisition . - correlate AC3 Golf expression profile pre-operative test human olfactory function - correlate EOG find pre-operative test human olfactory function . - systematically evaluate role individual intranasal agent olfaction optimize electrical signal acquisition olfactory tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study . Subjects recruit group patient University Washington Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery Clinic undergo endoscopic sinus surgery chronic sinusitis disorder nasal cavity sinus . Subjects sign consent complete subjective smell test ( UPSIT -- University Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test ) , SNOT-20 ( Sinonasal Outcome Test-20 ) During surgery , subject two four piece normally discard tissue preserve study . Subjects also two four piece healthy tissue remove ( total size approximately pencil eraser tip ) depend type surgery involve . The following procedure perform tissue : - immunocytochemistry utilizing antibody AC3 Golf determine pattern level expression proteins - two odorants , isoamyl acetate citralva , elicit odorant-induced activity human olfactory sensory neuron . The tissue also subject two putative human pheromone : 4,16-androstadiene-3-ol 1,3,5 ( 10 ) ,16-estrateraen-3-ol . - application six commonly use intranasal agent : 0.9 % saline , 1:1000,000 epinephrine , 0.05 % oxymetazoline , 1 % lidocaine , Zicam ( 0.12 % zinc gluconate ) Nasocort AQ ( triamcinolone acetate ) .</detailed_description>
