	<brief_summary>This study design test use G-CSF peripheral vascular disease . The investigator hypothesize mobilization angiogenic cell blood granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) may stimulate formation new blood vessel result sustain improvement blood flow patient severe peripheral arterial disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Mobilization G-CSF Treat Severe Peripheral Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One fourth patient peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) low extremity severe symptomatic disease 1-2 % critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) . In patient CLI , risk limb amputation 1 year 50 % . In addition , patient CLI often rest pain , non-healing ulcer severe limitation ambulation . Revascularization procedure , include bypass surgery , percutaneous transluminal angioplasty angioplasty stenting , currently treatment option . However , many patient eligible revascularization procedure due small vessel disease coexist medical problem . Moreover , restenosis rate high . There currently effective non-invasive treatment critical limb ischemia . We hypothesize mobilization angiogenic cell blood granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) may stimulate angiogenesis area ischemia result sustain improvement blood flow patient severe PAD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must critical limb ischemia secondary PAD , define presence nonhealing ulcer , rest pain , dry gangrene . Patients must toe pressure ≤ 30 mm Hg . Patients must ≥18 year old . Patient must able selfadminister daily subcutaneous injection caregiver able administer daily subcutaneous injection . Patients must take absolute contraindication take aspirin clopidogrel . If currently take aspirin , must willing take aspirin ( 81 mg daily ) clopidogrel ( 75 mg daily ) 14 day start first day GCSF treatment . After informed treatment involve , patient must give write consent . The patient serious medical psychiatric illness would prevent either give informed consent receipt treatment . A builtin period one week discussion trial initiation trial mandatory enrollment . Patients transmetatarsal high amputation affect limb exclude . Patients candidate revascularization procedure .</criteria>
