	<detailed_description>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation（PNF） define treatment method promote hastens response neuromuscular mechanism stimulation proprioceptor within related muscle joint . PNF stretch technique therapeutic technique use PNF concept relate muslces either increase neuro-inhibition mechanism release muscle spasm elongate muscle length , increase neuro-excitation mechanism enhance muscle strength . Improvement range motion use PNF stretching technique report superior technique previous literature , study do healthy adult . Less known effect PNF stretch improvement joint restriction . Range motion limitation usually disturb patient total knee arthroplasty . PNF stretch technique use frequently patient total knee arthroplasty clinical practice increase range motion effectively reduce knee pain exercise . However evidence-based research technique patient total knee arthroplasty . This research project , therefore , explore application PNF stretch change knee flexion , pain , muscle strength , function lower extremity follow total knee arthroplasty . Purposes： To investigate immediate short term effect angle knee flexion , intensity pain , strength knee extensor , function lower extremity use PNF stretch technique patient total knee arthroplasty . Method： Sixty patient receive total knee arthroplasty National Taiwan University Hospital recruit study . They allocate randomly either experimental control group . Conventional physical therapy give participant . Besides , experimental group assume PNF stretch technique third post-operative day day discharge . This technique execute physical therapist , include 5 trial isometric knee extension 6 , follow active knee flexion maximum range immediately , hold 10 . The rest interval 10 s. For control group , passive stretch technique treatment time give , instead . All participant ask home exercise discharge hospital . The outcome measure give first session treatment day , day discharge , one month operation . The variable measure ( 1 ) knee flexion angle measure universal goniometer , ( 2 ) maximum voluntary isometric strength knee extensor measure hand-held dynamometer , ( 3 ) pain score use pain visual analog scale , ( 4 ) function performance low extremity measure time go test , ( 5 ) Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) record 5 dimension include symptom , stiffness , pain , difficulty knee function and/or daily activity , limitation sport recreational participation , quality life .</detailed_description>
