	<brief_summary>A Phase II , multi-center , open-label , single-arm study 42 subject first recurrence progression GBM 12 site Australia , Europe , Israel , United States . Subjects receive intratumoral infusion PRX321 administer via convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) concentration 1.5 μg/mL total volume 60 mL 2 7 day . Primary Objective : To evaluate efficacy ( express overall survival 6 month [ OS-6 ] ) intratumoral infusion PRX321 subject first recurrence progression glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Secondary Objectives : To assess safety intratumoral infusion PRX321 subject recurrent progressive GBM . To evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ) , duration response ( DR ) , overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) . Tertiary Objective : To evaluate relationship observed infusate distribution clinical radiological response .</brief_summary>
