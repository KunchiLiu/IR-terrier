	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase III trial study well give induction therapy bevacizumab together combination chemotherapy without capecitabine follow bevacizumab maintenance therapy treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare two strategy induction bio-chemotherapy follow maintenance biotherapy term time failure patient previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer . Secondary - To compare two arm treatment term response rate , duration response , progression-free survival , safety , quality life patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord treatment center , performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , number metastatic site ( 1 v ≥ 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 induction therapy arm . - Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Patients also receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy comprise irinotecan hydrochloride IV 1 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive bevacizumab FOLFIRI chemotherapy ( B-FOLFIRI ) arm I . Treatment repeat every 2 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 oral capecitabine every 12 hour day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In arm , patient achieve stable disease completion 6 month induction therapy proceed maintenance therapy . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every 3 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . During completion maintenance therapy , patient tumor regrowth classified disease progression baseline achieve partial complete response induction therapy proceed reinduction therapy . - Reinduction therapy : Patients receive B-FOLFIRI describe previously . Quality life assess baseline , every 3 month induction therapy , discontinuation study therapy . After completion study therapy , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
