	<brief_title>Curcumin With Pre-operative Capecitabine Radiation Therapy Followed Surgery Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Therapy : Radiation therapy capecitabine commonly use treatment rectal cancer . Curcumin active ingredient spice , turmeric , commonly use Indian cooking . Researchers hope curcumin interfere cop mechanism cancer cell use avoid kill radiation , thus allow radiation great likelihood kill cancer cell . Study Therapy Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive radiation therapy day , 5 day row ( Monday-Friday ) 5-6 week ( 28 treatment ) . You take capecitabine capsule mouth twice day , morning night , day receive radiation therapy . These capsule take Saturday Sunday . These capsule take within 30 minute eat full glass water , fruit juice . You also randomly assign ( roll dice ) one two group . Participants one group receive additional treatment curcumin preparation . Participants group receive placebo . The placebo substance look like curcumin active ingredient . You 2 3 chance get curcumin . This mean every 3 participant enrol , 2 get curcumin 1 get placebo . Neither doctor know group assign . You take curcumin/placebo capsule mouth twice day , every day receive chemotherapy radiation therapy , empty stomach . The first dose day take 1 hour radiation therapy second dose take later even . These capsule must take Saturday Sunday well . The placebo curcumin treatment continue complete chemotherapy radiation therapy additional 6 week . Study Visits : Every week chemotherapy radiation treatment , follow procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check side effect chemotherapy radiation therapy . - You ask side effect experience . - A plain X-ray film take check position correctly . Questionnaires : You ask fill 2 questionnaire symptoms time enrollment , 1 time week receive radiation therapy , surgery . The 2 questionnaire take total 10 minute fill . Length Treatment : You receive 11 1/2 week curcumin placebo study . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 6-12 week complete radiation therapy , follow-up visit . At visit , physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . You ask side effect experience . You evaluate surgeon time . If tumor surgically remove , offer surgery remove tumor , standard care disease . In addition , matter surgery , 1 month ( +/- 1 week ) finishing study drug , receive telephone call study staff . They ask side effect experience may relate study drug . Your medical record review time time check health status information . This investigational study . Capecitabine , radiation therapy curcumin commercially available . Capecitabine FDA approve treat colon cancer surgery , treat rectal cancer ( specific type colon cancer ) spread . Radiation therapy standard treatment rectal cancer . The use curcumin capecitabine radiation therapy study investigational . At time , combination use research . Up 45 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
