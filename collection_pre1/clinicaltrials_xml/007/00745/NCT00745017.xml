	<brief_summary>Depression affect one million people Canada , result $ 14.4 billion per year cost Canadian society . In order prevent often lifelong disorder , critically important identify risk factor recurrence depression . A crucial force maintain depression generation stressful life event . That , individual history depression likely generate event precipitate future depressive episode ( e.g. , relationship break-up , fire job , conflict law ) due negative personality characteristic disrupt social support network result previous episode . This project first test model examines role negative personality , low social support , childhood abuse neglect risk factor generation stressful life event predict future depression . We test model group patient meet formal criterion depression treat follow 12 month depression recurrence . With long-term design unique position understand depression maintain time , thus suggest important treatment strategy prevent depression recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stress Generation Recurrent Depression : The Role Differential Treatment Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) Treatment Depression Collaborative Research Programme ( TDCRP ) ( Elkin et al. , 1989 ; Sotsky et al. , 1991 ) compare three form treatment depression -- imipramine plus clinical management ( IMI-CM ) , cognitive behaviour therapy alone ( CBT ) , interpersonal therapy alone ( IPT ) -- placebo control plus clinical management ( PLA-CM ) condition . These three treatment find equally effective treatment index episode depression compare placebo control ( Elkin et al. , 1989 ) . The result TDCRP study also indicate patient characteristic , irrespective treatment modality , predictive treatment effect . Six patient dimension -- social dysfunction , cognitive dysfunction , expectation improvement , endogenous feature , double depression duration current episode -- find significant predictor outcome ( Sotsky et al. , 1991 ) . Patient characteristic also find associated differential outcome depend treatment modality . Elevated social dysfunction , example , interfere successful outcome IPT , whereas cognitive dysfunction hinder successful outcome CBT . Cognitive dysfunction also predict poor treatment response IMI-CM condition . Cognitive vulnerability would expect mediate response treatment CBT , presume mechanism change dysfunctional depressogenic cognition ( e.g. , Beck et al. , 1979 ; Whisman , 1993 ) . The find cognitive vulnerability also implicate treatment response pharmacological intervention without theoretical explanation specific causal agency . The purpose propose research examine relationship treatment outcome patient characteristic associate depression . In particular , relationship treatment outcome two personality/cognitive characteristic implicated vulnerability factor depression - self-criticism dependency - explore . The first aim propose investigation examine relationship change self-criticism dependency relationship change treatment response reduction severity depression . Mode-specific outcome measure administer outpatient major depression randomly assign treat CBT , IPT PHT . The second aim study examine issue whether successful target either cognitive dysfunction CBT interpersonal functioning IPT result reduce risk relapse and/or recurrence major depressive episode . We believe dependent type , centre definition self entirely around issue affiliation others , would likely show change relate theme therapeutic intervention specifically design address interpersonal problem . In contrast , self-critic defines self primarily around issue relate achievement engages excessively harsh unrealistic self-appraisal would respond best intervention target punitive cognition . HYPOTHESES/RESEARCH QUESTIONS Prediction Treatment Outcome ( Objective 1 ) : Two set hypothesis propose . In analysis DEQ use assess self-criticism dependency . The first set hypothesis involve mode specific treatment outcome second set hypothesis address difference mechanisms change across treatment . The first set hypothesis : ( ) treatment equally effective treatment index episode , ( b ) baseline self-criticism dependency score predict outcome treatment , high self-criticism dependency score related poor outcome , ( c ) CBT demonstrate great specificity target self-criticism either PHT IPT , ( ) IPT demonstrate great specificity treat interpersonal functioning either PHT CBT , ( e ) PHT demonstrate great specificity treat endogenous symptom either CBT IPT . The second set hypothesis : ( ) change self-criticism score dysfunctional cognition mediate positive treatment response CBT IPT PHT , ( b ) change dependency score interpersonal deficit mediate positive treatment response IPT CBT PHT , ( c ) change endogeneity mediate positive treatment response PHT CBT IPT . Prediction Relapse Recurrence ( Objective 2 ) : It hypothesize : ( ) CBT IPT produce low rate relapse recurrence PHT great reduction stable dysfunctional cognition relate either self-critical and/or interpersonal vulnerability ; ( b ) case interpersonal vulnerability predominant , IPT produce low rate relapse recurrence either CBT PHT , case self-critical vulnerability predominant , CBT produce low rate relapse recurrence either IPT PHT .</detailed_description>
