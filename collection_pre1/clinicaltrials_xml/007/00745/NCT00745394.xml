	<brief_summary>Non-invasive assessment blood flow organ long challenge clinician . Recently , near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) recognize methodology may achieve goal . A commercially available NIRS monitor , market Somanetics , Inc. , widespread use clinical care pediatric cardiac patient operate room intensive care unit post-operatively . When patch/probe monitor place forehead lower back , blood oxygen concentration data obtain found correlate actual blood sample take IV . The presence NIRS data would give surgeon important feedback blood flow important area like brain kidney heart surgeries child operation complete intensive care unit . The investigator wish perform prospective study NIRS monitor use child need heart surgery require heart-lung bypass sometimes require monitoring ICU , post-operatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) During Heart-Lung Bypass Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After patient prospectively consent pre-operatively , standard medical care , include use NIRS monitor , implement patient 's operation post-operatively intensive care unit modification . These modification include : ( 1 ) placement oximetric probe lumen cardiopulmonary bypass circuit tube output continuous blood oxygen content bypass , ( 2 ) addition extra connector bypass tube allow blood draw surgery , ( 3 ) placement doppler blood flow probe tube measure blood flow velocity , ( 4 ) addition LFTs post-operative phase , follow . Patients receive operation require circulatory arrest and/or selective cerebral perfusion follow ICU 5 day . Data bypass machine along , data collect NIRS oximetric probe monitor , serum data interfaced data collection system . Data collect : Minimum patient demographic data ( age , sex , ethnic origin ) , NIRS data , serum blood gas data , serum lactate level , hemoglobin level , vital sign , doppler blood flow data , LFT analysis , clinical course events/data ( i.e . need dialysis , length stay , surgical time point , etc ) , diagnostic test result ( EKGs , ECHOs , etc ) , significant medical history data , standard care laboratory result . The investigator wish evaluate relationship data patient 's diagnosis , operation perform , post-operative course , outcome . Validation use NIRS monitor characterization NIRS monitor also seek .</detailed_description>
