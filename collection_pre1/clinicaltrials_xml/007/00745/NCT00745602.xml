	<brief_summary>The propose research investigate whether irregular effect atrial fibrillation body 's circulation directly impact regulation cerebral blood flow . To delineate finding , investigation potential effect include difference postural positioning . This data use understand overall hemodynamic effect atrial fibrillation extra-cardiac organ body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Atrial Fibrillation Hemodynamics Regulation Cerebral Blood Flow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study evaluate 10 subject refer elective direct current cardioversion ( DCCV ) atrial fibrillation . Subjects see Parkland Health Hospital System . After full consent obtain explanation research , subject undergo series entirely non-invasive test include Transcranial Doppler ultrasound ( TCD ) , manual cuff blood pressure ( BP ) , beat beat BP monitoring Portapress monitor , respiratory tidal CO2 . These measurement take lay patient supine position 10 minute subsequently stand 10 minute . Measurements also take full body squat -stand repetition 20 second interval ( 0.05 Hz ) x 5 minute . Patients unable squat may rise seat position chair . This protocol easy follow even debilitated patient Alzheimers Disease Dr. Zhang Dr. Levine 's laboratory . The subject undergo elective DCCV plan standard care . The measurement respective body position repeat 30 minute later patient successfully convert normal sinus rhythm DCCV . The experimental test take approximately 1 Â½ 2 hour complete .</detailed_description>
