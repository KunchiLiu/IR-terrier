	<brief_summary>Ischemia- reperfusion ( IR ) injuries see transplanted organ also remote organ lung brings major postoperative complication . Severe complication pulmonary infiltration pulmonary edema follow reperfusion frequently associate liver transplantation . Cardiac surgery perform use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) provoke systemic inflammatory response syndrome affect postoperative pulmonary , myocardiac renal function . Previous study reperfusion injury focus leukocyte endothelial activation follow oxidative injury , however , alteration pulmonary function dynamic compliance oxidative/antioxidative balance erythrocyte follow effect CPB fully study . Erythrocytes ' reaction oxidative stress include cytoplasma cell membrane study RBCs major circulate blood cell different type antioxidant system capture reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) thus RBC may severely injure ROS protect ROS injury CPB . In three-year study , plan explore extent pattern remote oxidative injury lung massive ROS production follow product release reperfused organ . In first year , remote pulmonary injury hepatic IR focus . We plan establish animal model pulmonary function pulmonary injury assessment include dynamic compliance ( Cdyn ) , pulmonary edema wet-to-dry ratio ( W/D ) , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) histopathological finding hepatic IR challenge . In second year , IR effect CPB circulate blood cell fully study . We plan investigate magnitude , subtypes time ROS production , change oxidative antioxidant activity erythrocytes include cytoplasma cell membrane , change leukocytes plasma explore role circulate erythrocyte oxidative stress CPB . In third year , plan try propofol , state antioxidant vivo vitro , remote pulmonary injury follow hepatic IR CPB .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Seven ml blood sample take arterial line stabilization anesthesia ( T1 ) , 30 minute total CPB ( T2 ) , one hour wean CPB ( T3 ) 24 hour wean CPB ( T4 ) . One ml blood sample immediately wrap aluminum foil keep ice immediate measurement MetHb , COHb CL ( ROS ) . CL assay carry within 2 hour sample . Six ml sample remain placed tube contain ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid . Serum separate ( 2000rpm 10 minute ) immediately sample store -80â„ƒ TAS assay , cytokine measurement , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) determination , complement leukocyte elastase measurement . Those assay measurement carry within 4 week surgery . Measurements hemoglobin ( Hb ) , COHb MetHb : Hb , COHb MetHb measure immediately ABL520 , Radiometer , Copenhagen , Denmark ) . Measurement Redox balance : 0.2ml fresh drawn blood use measure ROS production lucigenin Chemiluminescence ( CL ) ( detect superoxide mainly ) luminal CL ( detect H2O2 HOCl mainly ) previous study.The total antioxidant status 20 uL plasma measure total antioxidant status ( TAS ) kit ( TAS CAL , Randox ) . Hemodilution effect CPB , TAS level T2 correct hematocrit . Lipid peroxidation determine thiobarbiturate reaction measure formation MDA plasma TBARS assay kit ( Cayman chemical co.
