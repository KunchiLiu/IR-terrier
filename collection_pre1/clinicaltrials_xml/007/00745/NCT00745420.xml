	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Effectiveness Bone Marrow Transplants Children With Sickle Cell Disease ( BMT CTN 0601 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCD inherit blood disorder . Symptoms include anemia , infection , organ damage , intense episode pain , also call `` sickle cell crisis . '' SCD cause abnormal type hemoglobin , protein inside red blood cell carry oxygen vital organ , brain , heart , lung , kidney . Defective hemoglobin damage red blood cell . The damage cell , turn , block blood flow vessel block oxygen nutrient reach organ . For people severe form SCD , one treatment option bone marrow transplant , may correct abnormal blood cell production problem . In case , bone marrow transplant perform people healthy sibling tissue type . If people sibling tissue type , possible receive blood stem cell transplant unrelated donor bone marrow transplant . Traditionally , people SCD undergo bone marrow transplant receive high dos chemotherapy medication transplant part condition regimen prepare immune system accept donor cell . Participants experience few side effect reduce intensity condition regimen intense condition regimen . The purpose study determine safety effectiveness blood stem cell transplant , use bone marrow unrelated donor , child severe SCD receive reduce intensity condition regimen transplant . Specifically , researcher evaluate whether reduce intensity condition regimen successful allow donor cell settle grow successfully , prevent production SCD-damaged red blood cell , limit SCD-related organ damage . This study enroll child severe SCD lack sibling tissue type serve donor . Participants attend study visit prior transplant undergo blood collection , neurocognitive testing measure learn brain function , magnetic resonance angiogram ( MRA ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Questionnaires assess quality life also complete . Twenty-two day transplant , participant begin receive reduce intensity condition regimen chemotherapy medication prepare transplant . Eight day transplant , participant admit hospital continue condition regimen . Participants receive bone marrow transplant . After transplant , participant receive immunosuppression medication least 6 month prevent graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , may occur immune cell donate bone marrow attack body recipient . One week transplant , participant receive granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , natural protein increase white blood cell count help protect body infection . Participants receive G-CSF white blood cell level normal . Participants remain hospital closely monitored sign infection complication study researcher feel safe return home . After leave hospital , participant attend study visit weekly Weeks 1 8 , Day 60 , weekly Weeks 9 14 , Day 100 , Month 6 , Years 1 2 . At study visit , blood collection , medical history review , physical exam occur . In addition , Day 100 , Month 6 , Years 1 2 , questionnaire assess quality life complete . At select visit follow procedure also occur : lung function testing , heart function testing , MRA MRI scan , neurocognitive testing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>SCD ( genotype hemoglobin SS disease [ Hb SS ] , genotype hemoglobin SC disease [ HbSC ] , sickle ß° [ Sß° ] thalassemia , sickle ß^+ [ Sß^+ ] thalassemia ) one following : 1 . Patients must symptomatic SCD ( genotype Hb SS , Hb SC , Sß° thalassemia Sß+ thalassemia ) , AND 1 follow clinical complication : ( ) Clinically significant neurologic event ( stroke ) neurologic deficit last 24 hour accompany infarct cerebral MRI ; OR ( ii ) patient Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) velocity exceed 200 cm/sec nonimaging technique ( TCD measurement great 185 cm/sec imaging technique ) measure minimum 2 separate occasion one month apart ; OR , 2 . Minimum two episode acute chest syndrome 2 year study entry , define new pulmonary alveolar consolidation involve least one complete lung segment ( associate acute symptom include fever , chest pain , tachypnea , wheeze , rale , cough attribute asthma bronchiolitis ) despite adequate supportive care measure 3 . History 3 severe pain event per year 2 year study entry Lansky/Karnofsky performance score great equal 40 Patients must unrelated adult bone marrow donor Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) match 8 8 HLAA , B , C DRB1 high resolution use DNAbased typing . Patients adequate physical function : ) Cardiac : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) great 40 % , LV shorten fraction great 26 % ; b ) Pulmonary : Pulse oxymetry baseline O2 saturation great equal 85 % required patient , Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity ( DLCO ) great 40 % ( correct hemoglobin ) patient pulmonary function test perform ; c ) Renal : Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal age glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) great 100 mL/min/1.73 m. For patient older equal 16 year age , GFR great 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2 ; ) Hepatic : Serum conjugate ( direct ) bilirubin le 2x upper limit normal age per local laboratory ; alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) less 5 time upper limit normal per local laboratory . If patient receive chronic transfusion therapy equal 1 year AND clinical evidence iron overload ( serum ferritin level great 1000 ng/ml ) , liver biopsy shall obtain within 90 day start condition therapy ( alemtuzumab ) . Histologic exam liver must document absence bridge fibrosis cirrhosis liver . In case , liver biopsy optional . Hemoglobin S ( Hb S ) level less equal 45 % , seven day prior initiation alemtuzumab Evidence uncontrolled bacterial , viral fungal infection ( currently take medication progression clinical symptom ) within 1 month prior start condition regimen . Patients fever suspect minor infection await resolution symptom start condition regimen Pregnant breastfeed Patients 8/8 HLAmatched family donor able donate Seropositivity HIV Prior allogeneic marrow stem cell transplant Iron chelation must discontinue equal 48 hour initiate condition regimen Hydroxyurea ( receive therapy ) must discontinue equal 48 hour initiate condition regimen</criteria>
