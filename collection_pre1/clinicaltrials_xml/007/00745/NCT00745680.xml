	<brief_summary>Left ventricular ( LV ) remodel acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) well describe previous study . However , paucity data incidence risk factor LV remodel modern clinical practice incorporates widespread use acute reperfusion strategy almost systematic use `` antiremodeling '' medication , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor beta blocker . The recent improvement AMI management abolish LV remodeling , remain relatively frequent event initial anterior wall AMI . As lead cause heart failure , postinfarction LV remodel represent important target therapeutic intervention . Within ventricular mass , size , shape , connection orientation three-dimensional space every single constituent determine functional behavior . The complex architecture ventricular mass create multiple inhomogeneity electrical mechanical load cellular microscopic tissue level , cause cardiac function 'stochastic nature ' . The myocardial infarction alter ventricular shape functional inhomogeneity carry morphodynamic advantage impair suction diastole diminish recoil relaxation decrease twist strain systole . The alteration contractile mechanic interact intraventricular fluid dynamic file influence regional myocardial shear stress . Altered LV transmural wall strain propose cause infarct extension may important role propagate LV remodeling .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We currently witness advent new diagnostic tool therapy heart diseases , , without serious scientific consensus fundamental question normal diseased heart structure function . During last decade , three successive , international , multidisciplinary symposium organize order setup fundamental research principle , would allow u make significant step forward understanding heart structure function . ( Kocica MJ et al. , 2006 ) Helical ventricular myocardial band ( HVMB , Figure 2-1 ) Torrent-Guasp revolutionary new concept understand global , three-dimensional , functional architecture ventricular myocardium . This concept define principal , cumulative vector , integrate tissue architecture ( i.e . form ) net force develop ( i.e . function ) within ventricular mass . Helical ventricular myocardial band Torrent-Guasp may also , hopefully , allow overcome difficulty encounter contemporary effort create comprehensive mathematical model heart . Within ventricular mass , size , shape , connection orientation three-dimensional space every single constituent determine functional behavior . This kind spatial dependence allow ventricular myocardial mass consider source interdependent vectorial force ( i.e . electrical mechanical ) , generate different length time scale . The ultimate net result vectorial force translate uniaxial sarcomere shorten efficient three-dimensional deformation ventricular cavity . The complex architecture ventricular mass create multiple inhomogeneity electrical mechanical load cellular microscopic tissue level , cause cardiac function 'stochastic nature ' . However , macroscopic ( i.e . organ ) level , stochastic event become average appear consistent continuous medium . This dialectic coexistence complexity simplicity , discreetness continuity suggest existence certain rule-based assignment , 'may apply equally well ventricular myocardial fiber ' , enable ventricular myocardial mass assemble abundant , dynamic , stochastic vectorial force produce apparently smooth , average , continuous , global response .</detailed_description>
