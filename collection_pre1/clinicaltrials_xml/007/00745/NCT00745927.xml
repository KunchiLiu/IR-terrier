	<brief_summary>It report carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) insufflation reduce patient pain abdominal discomfort colonoscopy . Its safety efficacy colonoscopy even sedation already assess early trial . Air insufflation still standard method , however , lack suitable equipment continue technical improvement colonoscopy . In laparoscopic surgery , CO2 insufflation widely apply safely use patient general anesthesia . CO2 insufflation also apply CT colonography reduction discomfort procedure.2 During endoscopic procedure colorectal neoplasia resection , however , long procedural time may increase degree discomfort procedure also risk perforation . In addition laparoscopic surgery , CO2 insufflation also apply endoscopic procedure . Saito et al report application CO2 insufflation Endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) colorectal neoplasia prospective study average procedural time use CO2 insufflation 90 minute conscious sedation average 5.6 mg midazolam . When compare control group use room air , statistically negligible difference pCO2 observe significant difference abdominal discomfort.6 Screening colonoscopy , complete within 15 minute lesion detect , require high screenee satisfaction improve patient compliance . In set colonoscopy positive FOBT , attendance rate secondary colonoscopy around 60 70 % accord data demonstrate previous RCT population-based study . With application CO2 insufflation , improvement patient compliance anticipate . This study aim investigate whether use CO2 insufflation reduce examinee discomfort comparison air .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Setting : Screening colonoscopy secondary colonoscopy positive FOBT perform endoscopic unit single university hospital - Study design : Single blind randomize trial - Randomization process : seal envelope - Study subject : Inclusion criterion : Subjects receive Screening colonoscopy secondary colonoscopy Exclusion criterion : subject COPD cardiovascular disease - Study duration : June 2008 November 2012 - Post-colonoscopy discomfort measure obtain screenee several time point use visual analogue pain score system : - Immediately colonoscopy non-sedated patient , immediately awaken sedation sedate patient - 2 hr colonoscopy - 8-12 hour colonoscopy - Statistical analysis : - Sample size estimation : accord previous unpublished data use air insufflation colonoscopy , mean pain score 3 standard deviation 2.38 . Assuming 15 % difference discomfort , sample size 171 require group ( CO2 vs. air , sedate non-sedated ) study . ( 2 side test , Î±=0.05 , power=80 % ) - Student t-test pain score comparison - Ancillary analysis : pCO2 , sedation drug dosage , procedural time group . For TCCO2 comparison , ANOVA repeat measurement use . For variable normally distribute , Wilcoxon rank sum test wall use supplementary analysis . - SAS statistical program , version 9.0 ( SAS institute Inc. , Cary , NC ) use statistical analysis</detailed_description>
