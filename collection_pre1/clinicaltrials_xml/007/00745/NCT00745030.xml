	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) second common neurodegenerative disorder elderly affect million patient US . Sleep dysfunction impact 90 % PD patient . PD patient experience variety sleep disorder include parasomnias , specifically REM behavior disorder ( RBD ) precede onset motor manifestation PD . RBD negative consequence patient ' bed partner ' quality life mainly due impact sleep quality day time alertness . RBD also predispose affected individual bed partner physical injury . There FDA approve treatment RBD . Clonazepam commonly use treatment carry risk daytime sedation , tolerance , withdrawal symptom . More recently , melatonin demonstrate effective several small study . Ramelteon , selective melatonin receptor agonist favorable safety profile , could potentially effective treatment RBD . This pilot protocol investigate safety efficacy ramelteon treatment RBD subject parkinsonism . We plan recruit 20 subject RBD diagnose base clinical interview confirm polysomnographic ( PSG ) data . The study design prospective randomize placebo control 12-week study . Primary outcome measure change frequency RBD event base daily sleep diary . Secondary outcome measure change amount tonic muscle activity base result baseline final PSG . A number secondary exploratory outcome measure collect</brief_summary>
