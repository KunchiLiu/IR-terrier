Spermatozoa injection ( improvement ) vagina cervix ( Intra-Cervical Insemination , ICI ) . 3 . Spermatozoa injection ( improvement ) directly uterus ( IUI-Intra-Uterine Insemination ) . The EVIE - Slow Release Insemination method : The slow release insemination utilize Grasby type MS16 pump 3 hour . The release rate motile spermatozoa 50X103 per minute . Advantages : - Very close approximation natural procedure spermatozoon arrive fertilization site long period . - An extended `` window opportunity '' meet ovum spermatozoon longer . - There loss spermatozoon due leak sometimes happen single-time injection practice IUI method . Primary Endpoint : Accumulation 50 cycle SRI- slow release insemination ( study group ) addition 50 cycle regular IUI ( control group ) . Two week insemination Beta hCG test Secondary Endpoints : Four week insemination - US Viability scan Procedure : Subjects woman fertility difficulty designate IUI treatment . 100 insemination cycle conduct .
