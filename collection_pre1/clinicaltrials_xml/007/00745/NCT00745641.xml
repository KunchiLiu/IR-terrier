	<brief_summary>The clinically widely use X-ray compute tomography examination low-grade radiation effect recently attract much attention concern possible adverse effect radiation human body [ ref . 1-5 ] . The radiation harmful human tissue cell mainly interact water ( make 80 % cell ) generate reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , especially formation hydroxyl radical . So far reach , report concern relation X-ray compute tomography examination blood ROS level . Therefore , wish conduct study clarify routinely applied abdominal X-ray compute tomography examination may induce high level ROS peripheral blood . Study subject patient admitted hospital abdominal disease need receive abdominal X-ray compute tomography examination diagnosis . In total , sixty case enrol study . The formal consent deliver explain patient family several hour performance abdominal X-ray compute tomography . The formal consent retrieve peripheral blood sample performance compute tomography.ROS level sample peripheral blood , performance abdominal X-ray compute tomography , measure , compare , analyze . Totally 120 blood sample , include 60 sample 60 sample 2 hour performance compute tomography , collect 60 study subject within 5 month ( August 10 ~ December 30 , 2008 ) . Reactive oxygen species（ROS）levels measure chemiluminescence ( CL ) analyse system ( CLD-110 , Tohoku Electronic Industrial , Sendai , Japan ) .</brief_summary>
