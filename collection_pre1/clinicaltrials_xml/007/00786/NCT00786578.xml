	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes grow public health issue one component Type 2 diabetes 'insulin resistance '' - ability insulin work less well . The skeletal muscle one large user sugar body , skeletal muscle `` insulin resistant '' , contribute diabetes . There evidence amount fat skeletal muscle related amount insulin resistance . We ask people participate study look amount fat muscle fat amount change exercise . We hypothesize heavy people higher amount fat deplete fat slowly lean subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Skeletal Muscle Lipid Content Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) content skeletal muscle correlate insulin resistance obese subject . Yet , endurance athlete high intramyocellular lipid content low insulin resistance . There several explanation paradox . This study use new magnetic resonance imaging technique look amount fat muscle depletion exercise . We hypothesize overweight subject higher amount fat deplete fat slowly lean subject .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age range age 18 45 . We limit upper age range increase age associate sarcopenia alteration fiber type . We define lean train group BMI &lt; 24 kg/m2 . We define overweight group BMI &gt; 26 25 kg/m2 . The subject participate regular running exercise ( &gt; 30 min/day , â‰¥ 5 days/week ) . Weight must stable [ +/ 5 pound ] least three month prior study participant . The subject must medication may affect lipid level , specifically lipid lower agent , birth control pill , diuretic . The subject high fat diet ( &gt; 45 % fat ) measure screen questionnaire . The subject must contraindications magnetic resonance imaging .</criteria>
