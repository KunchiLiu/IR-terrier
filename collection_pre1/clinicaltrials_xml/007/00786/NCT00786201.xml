	<detailed_description>This study test safety effectiveness experimental drug , CNTO 888 , compare placebo . The purpose research study determine CNTO 888 safe determine effect patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) . CNTO 888 approve regulatory authority use patient condition . The screen phase study , study doctor determine patient eligible study last 1 4 week . The study enroll treat first 20 patient part safety evaluation , select site . The patient randomize placebo 1 mg/kg 5 mg/kg 15 mg/kg CNTO 888 . The study drug give needle inserted patient 's vein ( IV ) . A Data Monitoring Committee responsible review portion study , study general . They review information patient portion study , patient receive three infusion study agent , 3 month pass since first patient enrol . After review , recommend whether continue enrol additional patient remainder study , require modification study . Patients receive study agent Week 48 continue follow Week 72 assessment safety effect discontinuation therapy . Patients study 74 week . The end study define last visit last patient . Patients randomly assign 1 4 treatment group . Group 1 , placebo IV infusion administer 90 minute every 4 week , Week 0 Week 48 . Group 2 , CNTO 888 1 mg/kg IV infusion administer 90 minute every 4 week , Week 0 Week 48 . Group 3 , CNTO 888 5 mg/kg IV infusion administer 90 minute every 4 week , Week 0 Week 48 . Group 4 , CNTO 888 15 mg/kg IV infusion administer 90 minute every 4 week , Week 0 Week 48 . Enrollment complete plan . Dosing terminate interim DMC ( Data Monitoring Committee ) review . Participants follow trial complete .</detailed_description>
