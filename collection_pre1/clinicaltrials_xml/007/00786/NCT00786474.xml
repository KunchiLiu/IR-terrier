	<brief_summary>Blood thinner , warfarin , prevent blood clot form , thereby reduce risk stroke heart attack . When people undergo surgery certain procedure , must stop use warfarin prevent much bleeding surgery procedure . Some doctor prescribe different blood thinner , one work quickly wear quickly , bridge gap start stop warfarin . However , short-term treatment expensive , may increase risk bleeding , proven effective . This study determine whether bridge blood thinner call dalteparin helpful harmful people atrial fibrillation stop take warfarin preparation surgery procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Bridging Anticoagulation Surgery ( The BRIDGE Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 2 million people North America take anticoagulant warfarin prevent stroke , heart attack , event related blood clot . Warfarin need stop person undergoes surgery certain procedure cause dangerous amount bleed surgery . Some doctor give low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) patient 2-week period participant without effect warfarin . The LMWH effect warfarin , act leaf system quickly warfarin . However , LMWH expensive , may increase risk bleeding , proven effective . This study determine safety efficacy LMWH adult atrial fibrillation stop warfarin preparation surgery . Participation study last 36 67 day . Participation involve nine point contact researcher , least two in-person visit research clinic . The others conduct phone . All point contact include assessment possible bleed new symptom . The first two point contact , take place signing inform consent , involve screen medical record random assignment participant receive either LMWH dalteparin placebo . Participants self-administer subcutaneous injection assign treatment twice day 3 day surgery procedure 6 day . During course study , participant visit primary physician regularly schedule appointment , recommend undergo two international normalize ratio ( INR ) test blood clot ability day 2 10 surgery procedure . The remain seven point contact occur sometime day surgery 37 day surgery . One in-person visit occur within first week surgery include assessment possible bleeding , new symptom , INR result .</detailed_description>
