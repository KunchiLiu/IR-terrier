	<brief_summary>In 2006 research group report initial finding multi-center prospective trial compare primary repair primary repair buttress biologic mesh make porcine small intestinal submucosa ( SIS ) . We able accrue 108 patient 7/2002-3/2005 follow patient 6 month perform UGI check durability repair rule recurrence . The result suggest significant benefit use SIS mesh short-term , primary group 26 % recurrence rate mesh group 9 % recurrence rate . While result encourage , important know durability long term benefit use SIS mesh . For reason propose follow-up original study patient outcome measure ( symptom questionnaire , SF-36 , UGI ) . This give u good idea long-term success laparoscopic PEH repair primary SIS mesh .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Paraesophageal Hernia Repair With Small Intestine Submucosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally paraesophageal hernia repair thoracotomy laparotomy morbidity around 20 % mortality 2 % .1,2 The advent later popularization antireflux operation via minimally invasive approach lead development similar ( laparoscopic ) approach treatment paraesophageal hernia . This approach call excision sac , thorough esophageal mobilization , primary closure hiatus Nissen fundoplication . 3,4 Laparoscopy appear benefit thoracotomy ( hiatus access easy , esophagus dissect direct vision high mobilization esophagus possible ) advantage laparotomy ( less morbidity , need collapse lung , need postoperative chest tube ) . In fact , PEH currently repair via laparoscopic approach . Hashemi et al 2000 report patient repair paraesophageal hernia via laparoscopic approach high recurrence rate compare operate via thoracotomy laparotomy.5 The study compare open laparoscopic repair reveal high incidence recurrence open repair group ( 8 % vs. 0 % ) ,6 also base solely symptom . Case series LPEHR evaluate recurrent hiatal hernia x-ray endoscopy find recurrence rate 12-42 % ,3,5,7 suggest significant room improvement . It surprising primary repair paraesophageal hiatal hernia suture pillar diaphragm together tension significant risk disruption . With development wide application mesh material tension-free repair inguinal ventral hernia , many surgeon apply technique tension-free closure mesh hiatal hernia . Two randomized trial demonstrate significant reduction recurrence rate use synthetic mesh large hiatal hernia repairs.8,9 However , potential problem introduce use synthetic mesh dynamic hiatus mesh erosion , ulceration , stricture , dysphagia.9,10,11 Recently , number biomaterials develop hernia repair . The idea behind biologic scaffold , usually contain extracellular collagen , serve temporary matrix , thus strengthen natural hernia closure.12,13 One mesh derive porcine small intestinal submucosa ( SIS ) ( Cook Surgical Indianapolis , IN ) . A pilot study use SIS PEH repair suggest safe possibly effective reduce recurrence.14 We organize carry multi-center randomize trial compare primary repair crus buttress primary repair SIS mesh laparoscopic PEH repair . The result 6 month operation demonstrate nearly 3-fold reduction recurrence rate use mesh ( 26 % 9 % ) .15 Furthermore , mesh related complication dysphagia , infection , erosion . These result meet tempered enthusiasm surgical community . The question many surgeon 's mind whether buttressed repair hiatus durable . To answer question need complete long term follow-up patient . The aim study determine use SIS reinforce closure hiatus patient paraesophageal hernias result low recurrence rate 2.5-5 year operation , result improve outcomes , without increase complication rate .</detailed_description>
