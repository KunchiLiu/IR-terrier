	<brief_title>The Efficacy Nurse-driven , Protocol Guided Ventilator Weaning Medical-Surgical Intensive Care Unit ( ICU )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ventilatory support one common indication admission ICU ( 1 ) . The duration mechanical ventilation associate several serious complication , increase mortality , prolong ICU stay , increase hospital cost ( 7,8 ) . Traditionally , process ventilator wean initiate carried physician . Recently , study support utility protocol guide wean algorithm . Its use associate earlier initiation wean , lead short ventilator time , trend short ICU length-of-stay lower hospital cost ( 1,2,4,9 ) Several study also show relative safety utilize nursing ( 3 ) RT staff alone cooperation medical staff wean patient mechanical ventilation ( 1,2,6 ) . We recently develop nurse-driven ventilator wean protocol ICUs St. Luke 's Roosevelt hospital . The protocol approve Critical Care Committee implement May 2007 . All ICU nurse , respiratory therapist , ICU physicians educate protocol We plan prospectively collect data look length stay mechanical ventilation patient wean nurse-driven ventilator wean protocol . We plan compare data retrospectively collect ventilator LOS data patient wean physician-initiated ventilator wean method .</detailed_description>
