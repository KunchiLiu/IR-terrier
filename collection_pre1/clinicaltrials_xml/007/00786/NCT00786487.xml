	<brief_summary>We interested skeletal muscle process fat may affect insulin resistance . This important question since insulin resistance predate predicts type 2 diabetes . We know pharmaceutical grade fat infused people , develop insulin resistance . Likewise , would like infuse pharmaceutical grade fat trained subject , believe trained subject less insulin resistance , less decline muscle energy function , less accumulation fat metabolite untrained subject . For compare effect pharmaceutical grade fat infusion , also group train untrained subject give control ( glycerol ) infusion . Glycerol basically pharmaceutical grade fat infusion without fat component .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We interested skeletal muscle process fat effect insulin resistance . This important question since insulin resistance predate predicts type 2 diabetes . We know pharmaceutical grade lipid infused people , develop insulin resistance . Thus , would like infuse pharmaceutical grade lipid trained subject , believe trained subject develop less insulin resistance , less decline muscle energy function , less accumulation fat metabolite untrained subject . For compare effect pharmaceutical grade fat infusion , also group train untrained subject give control ( glycerol ) infusion . Glycerol basically pharmaceutical grade lipid infusion without lipid component . Three visit require . The first visit involve measurement fitness . A second visit involve measurement insulin resistance . The third visit involve inpatient stay , six hour infusion either lipid glycerol . Three muscle biopsy ( , ) take conjunction infusion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Regardless training status , age range age 18 45 . We limit upper age range increase age associate sarcopenia alteration fiber type 29 would like limit confound effect age . We define lean group BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2 . Weight must stable [ +/ 5 pound ] least three month prior study participant . The untrained subject must engage regular exercise program ( &lt; 30 minute regular exercise 1 week ) . The trained subject participate regular running exercise ( &gt; 45 min/day , â‰¥ 5 days/week ) preferably currently recently participate competition ( within 2 year ) . Regardless training status , subject must medication may affect lipid level , specifically lipid lower agent , birth control pills diuretic . The subject high fat diet ( &gt; 45 % fat ) measure screen questionnaire . We also administer PARQ questionnaire ( attach ) establish whether subject safe exercise testing . The female subject must pregnant . A pregnancy test perform prior study visit . If screen TG &gt; 300 ( base 1st visit result ) fast glucose &gt; 100 ( base 1st visit result ) , subject exclude . If subject allergic egg ( use lipid emulsion ) , soybean ( use lipid emulsion ) , lipid emulsion subject exclude study . Subjects take antiplatelet agent ( antiplatelet agent hold seven day ) subject take anticoagulation therapy exclude . Subjects clinically significant medical issue history hematologic ( platelet &lt; 100 ) , hepatic ( LFTs &gt; 2X nl ) , renal ( Cr &gt; 1.5 ) , pulmonary , cardiac abnormality ( include abnormal EKG ) also exclude .</criteria>
