	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Addition Bevacizumab VOIT Regimen Relapsed/Refractory Pediatric Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recent Children 's Oncology Group study evaluate 3-drug combination vincristine , oral irinotecan , temozolomide ( VOIT ) , find safe tolerable pediatric patient . This VOIT regimen may useful variety childhood cancer . Additional data suggest beneficial effect irinotecan improve give bevacizumab . Bevacizumab monoclonal antibody work protein call `` vascular endothelial growth factor '' ( VEGF ) . In cancer treatment , use reduce tumor growth block formation new blood vessel . All drug use study approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use adult certain cancer type . However , combination drug study consider experimental FDA approve use together . Each drug give child , combination temozolomide , irinotecan , vincristine give child one clinical trial . This first study four drug ( vincristine , oral irinotecan , temozolomide , bevacizumab ) give together child . Up 20 pediatric patient receive therapy . The previously establish bevacizumab dose 15 mg/kg administer intravenous infusion day 1 start every 3-week course . Intravenous vincristine give day 1 , oral irinotecan day 1-5 , oral temozolomide day 1-5 . Courses repeat frequently every three week patient evidence disease progression adequate recovery previous course . Cephalosporin antibiotic use reduce irinotecan-associated diarrhea . Patients monitor study toxicity response 6 course .</detailed_description>
