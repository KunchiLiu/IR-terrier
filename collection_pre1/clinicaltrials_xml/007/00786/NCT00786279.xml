	<brief_summary>We propose pilot study determine feasibility long-term clinical trial alcohol intake atherosclerosis , first step determine whether moderate drinking prevents cardiovascular disease hence understand full health effect alcohol across population . We randomize 40 participant age 55 old six-month period consumption 1 glass per day either pure alcohol ( diluted strength wine ) water . At baseline 6 month , measure several standard novel cardiovascular risk marker blood perform magnetic resonance imaging measure atherosclerosis aorta .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The feasibility long-term randomized trial alcohol intake clinical endpoint uncertain . One approach could minimize size duration randomize trial would assess effect alcohol progression radiologically-defined atherosclerosis . We propose proof-of-principle pilot study effect longer-term alcohol intake atherosclerosis . We recruit randomize 40 participant age 55 old high risk CHD six-month period consumption single 150 ml glass per day either 10 % ethanol ( approximate wine ) water . At baseline 6 month , assess aortic atherosclerosis use magnetic resonance imaging . We determine adherence several way , include serum marker , dietary recall , measurement unused beverage . The primary outcome feasibility study compliance alcohol intake two MRI examination . As secondary outcome , measure standard novel cardiovascular risk marker , include inflammatory marker measure glucose metabolism . We assess safety continual basis , include repeat test liver enzymes blood count . If successful , pilot study form basis definitive trial determine effect alcohol intake progression atherosclerosis , could establish feasibility even large , longer-term study alcohol intake occurrence cardiovascular event .</detailed_description>
