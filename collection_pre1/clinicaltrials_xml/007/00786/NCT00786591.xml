	<brief_summary>Acute pancreatitis refers inflammation pancreas associate sudden onset severe abdominal pain , often accompany transient systemic manifestation , include fever . In majority case , inflammatory process self limit patient recovers uneventfully ; however , 20 % 30 % case , protracted clinical course ensues disease may progress severe necrotizing form , often trigger systemic inflammatory response syndrome time , acute respiratory distress syndrome , renal failure , shock , disseminate intravascular coagulation may occur . In bad sequela , multiple organ dysfunction may follow death supervene . The clinical outcome patient suffer severe acute pancreatitis depend great extent early diagnosis prediction severity timely therapeutic intervention prevent local systemic complication . However , course disease often difficult predict outset . Currently , still single clinical laboratory test consider `` gold standard '' diagnosis and/or assessment severity acute pancreatitis . For disease may progress rapidly without apparent sign , ideal marker prediction disease severity patient would one measurable rapidly easily , besides able fulfill criterion require good biological marker . To identify potential marker acute pancreatitis require understanding pathophysiological process underlie rapid progression fulminant course disease . Although much remains elucidate , recent study animal suggest inflammatory mediator substance P hydrogen sulfide may play critical role . This study evaluate inflammatory mediator substance P hydrogen sulfide upregulated early disease process , level elevation predict disease severity .</brief_summary>
