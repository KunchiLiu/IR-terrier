	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Tailored Interactive Multimedia Reduce Colorectal Cancer Screening Disparities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Background : Interactive multimedia computer program ( IMCPs ) show promise way deliver personally tailor ( PT ) information enhance cognitive mediator health behavior improve patient outcome . However , unclear whether PT IMCPs deploy primary care office increase cancer screen uptake eliminate ethnic disparity uptake provide PT information user 's preferred language . - Aims/Hypotheses : We compare change colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen cognitive mediator ( self-efficacy , perceive barrier , readiness ) uptake result IMCP - PT enhance key cognitive mediator target patient ' self-identified ethnicity - change result non-tailored `` electronic leaflet '' control IMCP . The experimental control IMCPs offer English Spanish version . We hypothesize , compare appropriate control condition ( English , Spanish , combine ) : ( 1 ) English version PT IMCP enhance cognitive mediator CRC screen behavior English-speaking Hispanics non-Hispanics ; ( 2 ) similarly favorable change mediator Hispanics use Spanish version PT IMCP ; ( 3 ) deployment PT IMCP provide evidence elimination disparity CRC screen Hispanic non-Hispanic subject via relative impact cognitive mediator group ; ( 4 ) PT IMCP ( English Spanish combine ) increase CRC screen uptake Hispanics non-Hispanics ( consider separately ) via change cognitive mediator . - Methods : Randomized control trial 2 group , compare PT ( cognitive mediator ) CRC screen IMCP offer English Spanish version deploy primary care office visit non-tailored `` electronic leaflet '' CRC screen IMCP ( control ) also offer English Spanish . Screening method target fecal occult blood testing , flexible sigmoidoscopy , colonoscopy . Primary outcome CRC screen uptake , self-efficacy , perceived barrier , readiness . - Implications : Our finding determine whether IMCP PT cognitive mediator screen behavior deploy primary care office prior previously schedule visit activate patient various ethnicity undergo CRC screen . They may also suggest promising , portable method reduce disparity CRC ( ) screen uptake Hispanic non-Hispanic individual .</detailed_description>
