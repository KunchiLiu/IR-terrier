	<brief_summary>At field site southern Nepal , acute respiratory illness ( ARI ) lead cause mortality among young child . Besides immunization little evidence effective primary preventive approach ARI population basis . Low birth weight highly prevalent population well affect approximately 30 % live born infant . Low birth weight key determinant neonatal mortality also resistant cost-effective intervention resource poor setting . Given lack appropriate intervention poor , rural area develop country strong observational association open burn biomass fuel source ARI young child low birth weight , design community-based randomize trial determine reduction household indoor smoke exposure reduce incidence duration acute low respiratory infection child &lt; 36 month age low birthweight among newborn infant . Household indoor smoke reduction accomplish replace current cook stove household locally appropriate , inexpensive model efficient vent exterior . In addition , assess impact respiratory function symptom among adult household . The project 2 phase . Phase 1 cluster-randomized , community-based , step-wedge trial cookstove replacement rural population southern Nepal . Households randomize receive replacement cook stave appropriately design , efficient stove vent exterior different time period course study . An initial period surveillance ARI low birth weight establish baseline rate cluster . This follow randomized , serial replacement cook stove 12 month period . Surveillance continue throughout period additional 6 -18 month depend stove replace . Phase 2 individually randomize trial subset household receive either improved biomass stave phase 1 LPG stove gas . Follow-up phase 2 12 month outcomes phase 1 . Measurement indoor air particulate concentration conduct household stave replacement . The analysis phase focus estimate impact incidence ARI child low birth weight among live birth result stove replacement . Approximately 4200 child 1-35 month age require observe minimum 10 % reduction risk ARI 90 % power phase 1 . Given expected number live birth occur cluster , detect 50 gram difference birthweight 90 % power type I error 5 % . Phase 2 low power ( total 1800 household ) .</brief_summary>
