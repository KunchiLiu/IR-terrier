	<brief_title>A Clinical Demonstration EEG Brain-computer Interface ALS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People affect severe motor disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) need alternative method communication control . They may able use even basic conventional assistive technology , rely one way another muscle . For people , communication control technology depend neuromuscular function essential . Brain-computer interface ( BCIs ) give individual communication control capacity depend nerve muscle . It show even people almost completely paralyzed control sensor motor rhythm feature scalp-recorded electroencephalographic ( EEG ) activity use control move computer cursor one two dimension , select letter icon , even move robotic arm . The group focus develop clinically practical BCI application , translate laboratory people 's home , establish positive impact live people severe disability . The goal VA demonstration project show BCI technology clinically practical important new communication control option improve life veteran amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . The project test four well-supported hypothesis : ( 1 ) people ALS find ( soon find ) conventional assistive technology inadequate use BCI system important purpose daily life without close technical oversight , 2 ) continue even increase use throughout period study , ( 3 ) BCI use improve life , 4 ) BCI improve live family caregiver . In accord hypothesis , aim : Aim 1 : To recruit 2-4 person team VA health professional ( e.g. , physician , nurse , nurse- practitioner , physician 's assistant , EEG technician , therapist , rehabilitation specialist , medical researcher ) 5-6 participate VA center , train use ongoing support BCI home system . These team use VA ALS database , local ALS Association affiliate , VA clinic identify recruit site 3-4 patient ALS adequately serve conventional assistive technology ; stable physical social environment ; caregiver basic computer skill willing support BCI use . The VA team set BCI system patient ' home teach caregiver use system daily basis application individual patient desire , e-mail , environmental control , computer-mediated conversation , word-processing , and/or entertainment . The VA team provide long-distance Internet-based oversight patient begin use BCI technology communication control daily life . The Project team available onsite supervision begin BCI use periodic in-home evaluation later . In addition provide ongoing oversight guidance project , group focus reduce need continue expert support ( onsite remote ) incorporate BCI software adaptation adjustments essential reliable operation simplify streamline caregiver interface aspect system operation . The ultimate goal practical system use many severely disabled people home minimal ongoing technical support . Aim 2 : To assess extent success BCI usage impact quality life . Via Internet link periodic visit , Project team quantify amount BCI usage absolute term term importance support specific function ( e.g. , interaction family , e-mail ) ; quantify BCI performance term accuracy speed . In addition , standard specialize quality-of-life measure BCI assessment questionnaire use quantitatively evaluate long-term impact BCI technology live user , caregiver , family . The effect disease progression ( e.g. , loss remain neuromuscular function ) extent nature BCI use also monitor . We expect work establish communication control application provide BCI system heavily use people severely disabled ALS , BCI produce last improvement live life close , BCI even allow people would otherwise become totally locked-in continue interact family friend . The success project depend establishment maintenance reliable high-speed daily communication subject , VA sit , Project team . The VA investigator must able evaluate subject 's EEG data every day , 7 days/week , question answer , problem solve , system parameter optimize within 24 hr . In study , first primary hypothesis subject begin use BCI important purpose daily life continue even increase use throughout period study . Thus , primary quantitative outcome hypothesis 1 ) time spend use BCI 2 ) change time study period . If BCI use time substantial remain stable increase study , able conclude subject find BCI system desirable valuable . The second primary hypothesis BCI improve quality life people severely disabled ALS . Secondary outcome include : caregiver quality life measure ; patient caregiver assessment BCI usefulness ; BCI performance ( i.e. , speed accuracy ) ; amount time spend project staff technical support . The completion study achievement aim help move EEG base BCI technology laboratory demonstrate powerful , clinically practical , affordable communication control technology substantially improve life people ALS . Furthermore , study validate establish important new option , BCI-based communication VA provide many severely disabled patient . This achievement would make VA first entity world provide radically new important assistive technology patient . Forty prospective BCI Users satisfy inclusion criterion provide informed consent* . [ *Footnote 1 : Two additional people provide informed consent subsequently find satisfy inclusion criterion . ] Thirty-seven complete BCI assessment session , 28 satisfy BCI accuracy criterion , 27 BCI system place home .</detailed_description>
