	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect impair blood flow regulation exercise . It also determine whether effect important heart skeletal muscle tissue exercise . In addition , study decide whether temporarily reverse problem improve blood flow control , improve heart muscle tissue function help improve exercise capacity person type 2 diabetes . This study use two method : ( 1 ) give vitamin C intravenously ( IV ) ( 2 ) three month exercise training program . Up 100 subject enrol study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator find person type 2 diabetes impaired ability perform exercise even without clinically apparent complication . The reason mark abnormality unknown important decrease ability exercise could contribute decreased expenditure physical activity frequently observe population may potentially constitute early marker cardiovascular disease . The investigator wish evaluate effect impair blood flow regulation exercise capacity whether effect important heart skeletal muscle tissue exercise . In addition , investigator determine whether correct abnormality two method improve blood flow regulation ( acutely infuse Vitamin C three month chronic exercise training ) lead improved blood flow regulation , improved heart skeletal muscle tissue function hence well exercise capacity person type 2 diabetes . This information provide mechanistic understanding cause abnormal exercise response observe person type 2 diabetes well whether degree response modifiable . Interventions reverse exercise defect may facilitate patient adherence prescribe physical activity program potentially decrease cardiovascular mortality large segment population .</detailed_description>
