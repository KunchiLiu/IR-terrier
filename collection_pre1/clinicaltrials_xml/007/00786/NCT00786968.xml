	<brief_summary>This one-year extension study use laronidase spinal fluid treat spinal cord compression mucopolysaccharidosis I. Mucopolysaccharidosis I rare genetic condition due deficiency enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase . Spinal cord compression occur condition due accumulation material call glycosaminoglycans ( GAG ) . Laronidase manufacture form enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase deficient mucopolysaccharidosis I patient . The aim study determine whether laronidase safe effective give spinal fluid potential non-surgical treatment spinal cord compression due mucopolysaccharidosis I disease . Funding Source -- FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extension Study Intrathecal Enzyme Replacement Therapy MPS I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) develop mucopolysaccharidosis I ( MPS I ) , lysosomal storage disorder . ERT help many physical ailment due disease , treat central nervous system , due inability cross blood brain barrier . Our purpose test delivery ERT spinal fluid via intrathecal injection patient MPS I . In pilot study , use recombinant human Î±-L-iduronidase administer intrathecally per month four month individual Hurler-Scheie Scheie form MPS I spinal cord compression . If successful , intrathecal delivery could represent practical , straightforward method treat central nervous system disease due lysosomal storage .</detailed_description>
