	<detailed_description>The study design Phase II , prospective , non randomize , open-label , single arm , multicenter trial , patient locally advance metastatic ACC amenable complete surgical resection . STUDY OBJECTIVES The aim phase II trial evaluate clinical benefit toxicity combination Sorafenib plus metronomic chemotherapy patient locally advance metastatic ACC progress first second line chemotherapy . Primary objective To assess clinical benefit measure non progress rate 4 month combination Sorafenib plus weekly Paclitaxel patient locally advance metastatic ACC progress first second line chemotherapy . Secondary objective - Assessment Objective ( Complete Partial ) Response Rates - Assessment Duration Response - Assessment Hormonal Response - Assessment Progression-Free Survival - Assessment Overall Survival - Assessment relationship specific `` biomarkers '' cancer- treatment-related outcome - Assessment Quality Life EORTC QLQ-C30 - Assessment Toxicity ENDPOINTS The first disease assessment perform 8-weeks , subsequent assessment perform every 12 week end study . Primary endpoint - Progression-Free Survival rate ≥ 40 % 4 month Secondary endpoint - Response rate evaluation perform accord RECIST criterion . The method measurement technique use characterize identify report lesion baseline study . TREATMENT SCHEME Treatment scheme consist oral Sorafenib 400 mg p.o . bid plus intravenous Paclitaxel 60 mg/mq/weekly i.v. , disease progression .</detailed_description>
