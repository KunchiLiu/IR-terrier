	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find blood sugar level change day night people live spinal cord injury ( SCI ) compare people spinal cord injury . As people SCI get old become likely develop health problem , like everyone else . However , SCI increase risk certain problem . The amount time post-SCI also increase risk certain problem . This research project focus identify pattern change blood sugar level SCI . Sugar blood important source energy body . Too much sugar blood know hyperglycemia enough sugar blood know hypoglycemia . Under healthy condition , amount sugar blood automatically regulate steady level maintain . After SCI , however , automatic regulation damage . The likelihood experience much little blood sugar increase . Over time , much blood sugar lead development diabetes . In opposite situation , individual SCI begin experience frequent episode little blood sugar , lead acute emergency situation . The pattern blood sugar level change typical 24-hour time period person SCI know . There may unknown factor affect blood sugar level . In order find information , study involve continuously monitor blood sugar 3-day period variety person SCI . A non-invasive , wireless monitoring system attached abdomen . This system record blood sugar level every 5 minute . The information gather observational study vital understanding SCI alters regulation sugar level blood subsequent medical management population .</brief_summary>
