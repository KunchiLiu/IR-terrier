	<brief_title>A Survey Evaluate Rate Abnormal Glucose Tolerance Among Hong Kong Chinese Subjects With Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes become epidemic Hong Kong , affect 10 % population cause major burden health care system . Over 30-40 % patient admit medical ward Hospital Authority hospital diabetes contributory factor . It estimate thirty fifty percent patient stroke , heart failure acute myocardial infarction diabetes key causative factor . However , exact prevalence rate diabetes , include asymptomatic undiagnosed glucose intolerance , among subject coronary heart disease still unknown Hong Kong . Many heart disease patient undiagnosed diabetes remain untreated abnormal glycemic status , aggravate heart disease impair prognosis . The investigator plan conduct cross-sectional survey study rate undiagnosed diabetes glucose intolerance among Chinese patient coronary heart disease Hong Kong . The survey result important u plan logistics investigate manage potential glucose abnormality heart disease patient .</detailed_description>
