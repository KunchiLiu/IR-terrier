	<brief_title>Measurement Glucose/Glycogen Metabolism Humans Using Magnetic Resonance 4 7 Tesla</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On morning study subject report Clinical Research Center ask stay Clinical Research Center 72 hour . You ask eat anything midnight . Small plastic catheter place two vein subject arm infusion glucose measure blood glucose level every 15-30 minute . While subject study continuously receive small dose glucose enrich 13C label either catheter drink small amount sugar water solution every 15-60 minute . Subjects ask transfer Center Magnetic Resonance Research every 6-8 hour ( except night ) ask time conduct MRI scan follow : Subjects place patient bed magnet room one-to-two hour . A nurse stay subject time study . During scan subject may ask perform visual task watch change checkerboard pattern mirror place front eye . After scan subject receive low carbohydrate meal weight-maintenance . Subjects may ask receive infusion glucose and/or insulin one-to-three time and/or infusion 13C-enriched glucose start . During infusion subject 's blood sugar maintain either high low normal level 3 hour . This do ass effect hyper- hypoglycemia brain glycogen metabolism . Subjects may also ask several day prior study report Clinical Research Center `` mock '' study see comfortable MRI scan and/or test body 's response either protocol ( describe , carry Clinical Research Center ) . If subject would like try MRI procedure advance , test exceed 2 hour . If need test subject 's response infusion , `` pre-test '' involve draw blood administer glucose perform describe either protocol , last 4 hour . Magnetic resonance measurement perform magnet similar magnetic resonance image exam ( MRI ) . Subjects always possibility signal feel claustrophobic wish remove magnet . The magnetic resonance measurement associate regular clunk noise subject may initially find unpleasant . For comfort offer wear ear plug . During measurement magnet subject ask lie still time .</detailed_description>
