	<brief_summary>As people spinal cord injury ( SCI ) get old become likely develop health problem , like everyone else . However , SCI increase risk certain problem . This research project focus control blood sugar SCI . Sugar blood important source energy body . Too much sugar blood know hyperglycemia enough sugar blood know hypoglycemia . Under healthy condition , amount sugar blood automatically regulate steady level maintain . After SCI , however , automatic regulation damage . The likelihood experience much little blood sugar increase . Over time , much blood sugar lead development diabetes . In opposite situation , individual SCI begin experience frequent episode little blood sugar . It think level SCI , amount time post-injury , amount body fat important factor development hyperglycemia hypoglycemia . This study test 2 factor , level SCI amount body fat . A total 35 subject enrol , 24 SCI 11 able-bodied control . All procedure perform university 's clinical research center . Susceptibility hyperglycemia test subject drink sugar water solution take blood sample every 30 minute 2 hour . Hypoglycemia test carefully induce low blood sugar , take blood sample 2 hour time period evaluate different chemical , answer questionnaire different symptom experience procedure . Body fat measure special kind x-ray . It predict subject cervical injury body fat great risk experience hyperglycemia hypoglycemia . The result study provide important information future study aim examine effect exercise potentially therapeutic agent blood sugar regulation age SCI population .</brief_summary>
