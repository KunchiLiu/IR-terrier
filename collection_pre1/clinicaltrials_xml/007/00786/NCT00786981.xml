	<brief_summary>Lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS ) prevalent disable condition rapidly grow age population . People LSS often substantial physical psychosocial burden well significant healthcare cost affect individual society . It report patient LSS age 65 likely undergo spinal surgery condition estimate total annual inpatient expense one billion . Individuals undergo surgical treatment LSS tend older , therefore operative morbidity mortality particular concern . Functional benefit derive conservative treatment may increase health quality life individual suffer LSS avoid delay need surgery subject . As population continue age , identify effective non-surgical treatment option older patient LSS important research priority . Ultimately , information gain study help fill significant void medical literature regard non-surgical option patient population .</brief_summary>
