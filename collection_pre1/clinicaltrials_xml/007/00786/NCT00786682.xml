	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Hydroxychloroquine may help docetaxel work well kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give docetaxel together hydroxychloroquine work treat patient metastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Hydroxychloroquine Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess antitumor activity , term tumor response rate , docetaxel combination hydroxychloroquine patient metastatic , hormone-refractory , chemotherapy-naive prostate cancer . Secondary - To measure time disease progression overall survival . - To determine feasibility safety regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily day 1-21 docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day ( 6 course docetaxel ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
