	<brief_summary>We conduct research study tumor respond prior treatment . The subject receive investigational drug call IMC-1121B . ImClone LLC , maker IMC-1121B , run research study . We believe IMC-1121B block growth factor make cancer cell , new blood vessel grow . It believe without new blood vessel , cancer tumor get oxygen food need grow . This may stop cancer grow spread tumor cell may die . Since normal blood vessel already form adult , might possible stop tumor growth without harm normal cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conduct research study tumor respond prior treatment . The subject receive investigational drug call IMC-1121B . ImClone LLC , maker IMC-1121B , run research study . In order cancer grow , need blood vessel bring oxygen food . Cancer cell make growth factor cause abnormal growth new blood vessel . This call angiogenesis . Normally , new blood vessel grow adult . Angiogenesis inhibitor drug may prevent abnormal growth blood vessel tumor . IMC-1121B angiogenesis inhibitor . We believe IMC-1121B block growth factor make cancer cell , new blood vessel grow . It believe without new blood vessel , cancer tumor get oxygen food need grow . This may stop cancer grow spread tumor cell may die . Since normal blood vessel already form adult , might possible stop tumor growth without harm normal cell .</detailed_description>
