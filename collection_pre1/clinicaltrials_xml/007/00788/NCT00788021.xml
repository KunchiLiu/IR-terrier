	<brief_summary>Patients undergo kidney transplant must take medication prevent organ rejection . There standard immunosuppressant medication prednisone , tacrolimus ( Prograf ) , mycophenolate mofetil ( Cellcept ) sirolimus ( Rapamune ) give patient prevent rejection . It well known patient immunosuppressant medication increase risk viral infection , influenza . However , well understood immunosuppressive medication may uniquely affect immune response infection . This study determine whether unique difference effect immune system different immunosuppressive medication , particularly difference tacrolimus sirolimus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While benefit transplantation society substantial , ever-growing population immunosuppressed recipient pose unique challenge development immunization containment strategy protect population communicable pathogen weaponize infectious agent . The immunosuppressive regimen allow emergence successful transplant therapy inhibit T cell-dependent rejection also cause systemic immunosuppression , attenuate response vaccine general precludes use live attenuate vaccine . To date , relatively little detailed systematic study immune alteration accompany either short- long-term immunosuppressive regimen use clinical organ transplantation . Despite recent development increasingly effective , also increasingly complex , regimens use drug distinct molecular target , current policy vaccination transplant recipient generic remain base old concept rather new understand cellular molecular effect therapy human immune system . This proposal seek improve understand biological mechanism underlie distinct immunosuppressive regimen practice today ( calcineurin-inhibitor , CNI , sirolimus-based regimen ) emerge regimen employ agent novel mechanisms action , CD28 costimulation blocker , and/or JAK3 kinase inhibitor . Such knowledge critical strategy enhance desirable immune response precipitate rejection .</detailed_description>
