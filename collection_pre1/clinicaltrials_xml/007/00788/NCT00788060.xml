	<brief_summary>This single center , Phase Ib study Sunitinib RAD001 patient advance RCC . The study design phase I interpatient dose-escalation dose expansion maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) patient metastatic RCC . In dose escalation portion , patient treat sunitinib , give intermittent schedule ( 2 week daily dose follow one week drug . RAD001 give daily . Escalation drug occur tolerate . Treatment arbitrarily divide 3-week cycle , dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) determine Cycle 2 Day 0 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Escalation drug occur tolerate . Treatment arbitrarily divide 3-week cycle , dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) determine Cycle 2 Day 0 . Dose level evaluate one time begin 3 patient . If 1/3 patient demonstrate DLT ( define section Complete ) , enrollment proceed next dose level . 1/3 patient develops DLT , 3 patient accrue dose level . If 0-1/6 patient demonstrate DLT , enrollment proceed next dose level . However , 2 patient 6 demonstrate DLT dose level , enrollment proceed next lowest dose level . The high dose level result great 1/6 DLT consider MTD . Dose expansion proceed dose level . Once maximum tolerate dose establish regimen dose expansion 20 patient metastatic RCC undertaken . Up 10 patient positive FDG- PET scan baseline ( defined 1 target lesion demonstrate SUV &gt; 5.0 ) begin treatment per Figure 2B . Patients 1-10 begin Sunitinib Day 0 begin RAD001 Day 14 repeat FDG-PET scan . Patients 11-20 , 2 week lead-in period RAD001 begin Sunitinib 2 week later Day 0 . After repeat FDG-PET scan . Both group patient repeat PET scan Day 14 cycle 2 . Patients negative FDG PET scan ( SUV &lt; 5.0 lesion ) undergo repeat scanning . Patients undergo evaluation tumor response every 12 week appropriate measurement study ( CT , MRI , bone scan ) . In set mixed response ( progressive disease 1 lesion continue regression stable disease baseline lesion ) patient may continue study determine PI , treat physician patient ongoing clinical benefit patient .</detailed_description>

Also , current use chronic immunosuppressive therapy allow . Patients active brain metastasis ( history brain metastasis ) exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event .

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection ( require antifungal , antibiotic antiviral therapy ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( NYHC II great ) , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia ( uncontrolled SVT VT ) , uncontrolled diabetes psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) . Patients receive prior treatment mTOR inhibitor . Patients receive prior treatment Sunitinib eligible participate study .</criteria>
