	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Evaluate FDG-PET , Breast MRI , Breast Ultrasonography Monitoring Tumour Responses Patients With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer ( LABC ) Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Locally advanced breast cancer ( LABC ) usually treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow surgery radiation . At present , monitor tumour response chemotherapy primarily carry use physical examination begin chemotherapy cycle . Differentiating viable tumour tissue inflammation fibrotic scar tissue difficult . There grow body evidence newer image technique positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) may better determine whether tumour actually shrink . The purpose study determine sensitivity specificity PET , MRI ultrasound evaluate tumour response chemotherapy patient LABC compare physical examination , current standard care . Two objective study 1 ) determine whether PET , MRI ultrasound high sensitivity/specificity physical examination alone determine LABC patient achieve complete pathologic response follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy , 2 ) investigate whether additional investigation might lead change clinical management identify non-responders earlier physical examination alone . A prospective cohort study design conduct . Patients LABC receive chemotherapy undergo physical examination , PET , MRI , ultrasound baseline , midway , completion chemotherapy . Approximately 100 patient accrued 5-year period . This study give clinician insight usefulness PET , MRI , ultrasound monitoring treatment responses patient LABC . This could potentially lead change clinical management patient .</detailed_description>
