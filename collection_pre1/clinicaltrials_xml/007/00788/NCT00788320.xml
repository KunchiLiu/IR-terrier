	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis disease cause bacterium ( germ ) cause illness organ body , frequently cause disease lung . TB short tuberculosis . Treating TB require several month ( usually 6 month ) treatment , first 2 month intensive treatment usually four medicine . Treatment need keep infection get bad prevent death TB . Vitamin D hormone present human body manage level essential electrolyte calcium phosphate . Vitamin D important bone formation prevention bone breakdown ( osteoporosis ) investigator age . There also new evidence link vitamin D function immune system well . Even though body make vitamin D also obtain vitamin D diet , adult , especially patient tuberculosis low vitamin D level ( vitamin D deficient ) need correct . Full correction low vitamin D level require 6 week weekly vitamin D supplement . There several benefit correct vitamin D deficiency ( good bone health , good balance calcium phosphate ) , know whether correct vitamin D deficiency lead well immune response tuberculosis . Preliminary data suggest vitamin D increase level antimicrobial molecule ( cathelicidin LL-37 ) body , possibly lead well immunity tuberculosis . The primary objective pilot study ass relationship vitamin D level patient active pulmonary tuberculosis level LL-37 cathelicidin sputum whole blood .

	<brief_title>Vitamin D Active Tuberculosis ( TB ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.0 Introduction Background Tuberculosis remain enormous public health problem major cause morbidity mortality throughout world . The WHO estimate 8.8 million new case tuberculosis occur worldwide 2005 , along 1.6 million TB related death . New challenge TB control include HIV epidemic , well emergence multidrug resistant ( MDR ) extremely drug resistant ( XDR ) strain tuberculosis associate high morbidity mortality . While cure rate drug susceptible TB reach &gt; 90 % range give appropriate infrastructure diagnose treat patient , cure rate MDR-TB much low , best , approach 60 % accord late estimate WHO . In many part world , second line drug treat MDR-TB available . Not urgent need novel TB treatment regimen , adjunctive therapeutic modality need explored goal maximize clinical response patient drug susceptible drug resistant disease . The use vitamin D primary adjunctive TB therapy long history . Therapeutic dos oral vitamin D supplementation TB treatment first pioneer 1950 's Jacques Charpy , note excellent result cutaneous TB disease . Subsequently , vitamin D use primary adjunctive therapy pulmonary tuberculosis , practice fell favor effective antimycobacterial chemotherapy become widely available latter half twentieth century . More recently , however , resurgence interest vitamin D effective adjunctive therapy tuberculosis . Recent report indicate vitamin D may pronounce immunomodulatory role pathogenesis tuberculosis within human host . It well know area granulomatous inflammation TB sit increase vitamin D production stem activate macrophage Th1 lymphocytes within granuloma Recently , immunomodulatory function increase vitamin D level sit TB involvement demonstrate , 1,25 ( OH ) 2D , active metabolite form vitamin D , find induce antimycobacterial activity vitro monocytes macrophage . One propose pathway observed immunomodulatory effect vitamin D TB infection involve toll-like receptor ( TLR ) signal pathways innate immune system . Liu et al demonstrated macrophage TLR binding M. tuberculosis antigen upregulates expression cellular 1 hydroxylase , result high level active 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D . It also show 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D turn bind nuclear vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , activate downstream signal cascade result upregulation several aspect innate immune response , include induction newly describe anti-microbial peptide LL-37 , cathelicidin . Cathelicidins , addition broad spectrum antimicrobial activity , also possess chemotactic property neutrophil , monocyte T cell , among function within immune system . While mechanism action vitamin D demonstrate vitro , little clinical work do validate piece knowledge clinical practice care TB patient . As proxy vivo study , subsequent experiment Liu et al evaluated induction cathelicidin TLR activation macrophage sera African American Caucasian subject . These experiment demonstrate failure induce detectable level cathelicidin mRNA sample African American patient , know significantly vitamin D deficient Caucasians due difference vitamin D production skin . The difference cathelicidin mRNA level correct upon supplementation deficient serum therapeutic level 25 ( OH ) D3 prior TLR stimulation . Given preliminary result vitro study , propose clinical pilot investigation relationship vitamin D level cathelicidin production TB patient . It well know majority TB patient deficient vitamin D , unknown whether deficiency functional consequence treatment response relapse rate . While recent vitro data suggest vitamin D supplementation recent TB contact improve immune response Mycobacterium tuberculosis measure whole blood assay , clinical trial vitamin D supplementation latent active TB disease undertaken . In preparation large trial would need address clinical question , propose clinical relationship physiologic level vitamin D supplementation effect cathelicidin production within host need study , give recent suggestion vitro study ability generate adequate cathelicidin level may impact quality effectiveness host immune defense M. tuberculosis . 2.0 Objectives 2.1 Overall Objective The primary objective pilot study ass relationship 25-hydroxy vitamin D level patient active pulmonary tuberculosis level LL-37/cathelicidin sputum , saliva , whole blood .</detailed_description>
