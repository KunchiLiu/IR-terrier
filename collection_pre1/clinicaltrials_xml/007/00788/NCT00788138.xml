	<brief_summary>Vitamin D insufficiency common patient cystic fibrosis . The investigator study examine large dose vitamin D give patient cystic fibrosis admit hospital pulmonary exacerbation determine whether vitamin D improve clinical outcome whether dose give correct . The investigator hypothesis vitamin D therapy improve production anti-microbial peptide increase bacterial kill microorganism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vitamin D insufficiency common CF patient . Treatment vitamin D insufficiency CF patient require large dos vitamin D. Adequate vitamin D status CF important skeletal health prevention osteoporosis . In addition skeletal benefit vitamin D , recent evidence demonstrate vitamin D play important role regulation immune system increase anti-microbial peptide lung barrier site . Whether improve vitamin D status CF patient would enhance immune system yet explore clinical study . This would significant clinical impact CF care since vitamin D status remain undertreated , especially set infection . The hypothesis proposal rapid correction vitamin D insufficiency result improve innate immunity increase production anti-microbial peptide result effective kill bacteria . To address hypothesis , follow two aim propose : 1 ) To evaluate effect rapid correction vitamin D insufficiency adjunctive therapy production anti-microbial peptide acute respiratory exacerbation CF patient 2 ) To determine effect vitamin D treatment bacterial kill acute respiratory exacerbation CF patient correlate free LL-37 level sputum . The long term objective proposal research group study role nutrition include vitamin D improve immune system set infection CF .</detailed_description>
