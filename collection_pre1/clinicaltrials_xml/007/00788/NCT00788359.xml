	<brief_summary>Clinical translational research cystic fibrosis ( CF ) hamper lack biomarkers use identify promise new therapy . There urgent need development validation biomarkers quickly predict usefulness potential drug CF might prognosticate clinical course . In particular , combination protein biomarkers obtain non-invasively offer great promise . The goal project determine whether protein biomarkers blood demonstrate beneficial effect treatment two week . We intend initially target acute pulmonary exacerbation CF know subject treat intravenous antibiotic enhance mucus clearance display clinical improvement within two week . We propose prospectively collect blood sample large cohort well-characterized CF person serially inpatient admission pulmonary exacerbation longitudinally annual visit . Through proposal , hope identify CF lung injury biomarker panel increase set acute pulmonary exacerbation improve rapidly follow intravenous antibiotic therapy . Additionally , begin explore whether CF lung injury biomarker panel might also prognosticate clinical course include decline pulmonary function . Finally , study serve important source blood sample bank future biomarker therapeutic study design benefit entire CF community .</brief_summary>
