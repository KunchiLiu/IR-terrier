	<criteria>Diagnosed CD20positive lymphoproliferative disorder ( REAL/WHO ) bidimensionally measurable disease least 1 lesion &gt; = 1.0 cm ECOG performance score &lt; = 1 Adequate bone marrow function , independent growth factor support ( exception subject bone marrow heavily infiltrate underlying disease [ 80 % ] may use growth factor achieve ANC eligibility criterion ) per local laboratory reference range follow : Absolute Neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/μL ; Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 ( untransfused ) ; Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL . Subjects history autologous stem cell transplant ( e.g. , bone marrow ) must &gt; 6 month post transplant adequate bone marrow function , independent growth stimulate factor ( exception subject bone marrow heavily infiltrate underlying disease [ 80 % ] may use growth factor achieve ANC eligibility criterion ) per local laboratory reference range follow : Absolute Neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/μL ; Platelets ≥ 125,000/mm3 ( untransfused ) ; Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL . Subject must adequate renal , hepatic coagulation function per local laboratory reference range follow : Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min ; AST ALT ≤ 3.0 × upper normal limit ( ULN ) ; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN . Subjects Gilbert 's Syndrome may Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN ; aPTT , PT exceed 1.2 × ULN Females must surgically sterile , postmenopausal ( least 1 year ) , negative pregnancy test screen serum sample prior first dose study drug urine sample . Females surgically sterile postmenopausal ( least 1 year ) nonvasectomized male must practice least 1 follow : total abstinence sexual intercourse ( min.1 complete menstrual cycle ) , vasectomized partner , hormonal contraceptive least 3 month prior study drug administration , doublebarrier method . Inclusion Criteria ( Extension Study ) Subjects enter Extension Study must continue meet Inclusion Exclusion criterion , exception inclusion criterion regard measurable disease inclusion criterion regard laboratory parameter . Subjects enter Extension Study must also stable lab value per local laboratory reference range . In addition must meet follow lab criterion : Subjects must meet follow hematology coagulation lab criterion : Platelet count must ≥ 25,000/mm3 ( untransfused ) . Platelet count ≤ 50,000/mm3 must stable monitor increased frequency discretion investigator . Absolute Neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 500/μL . ANC ≥ 500/μL &lt; 1,000/μL monitor increased frequency discretion investigator . Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL . aPTT , PT exceed 1.2 × ULN . Subjects ' chemistry value must exceed Grade 2 . Grade 2 chemistry lab monitor increased frequency discretion investigator . Subjects must meet following chemistry criterion : Serum creatinine ≤ 3.0 × upper normal limit ( ULN ) institution 's normal range . AST ALT ≤ 5.0 × upper normal limit ( ULN ) institution 's normal range . Bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN . Subjects Gilbert 's Syndrome may allow Bilirubin &gt; 3 × ULN base joint decision investigator Abbott medical monitor . History clinically suspicious cancerrelated Central Nervous System ( CNS ) disease , allogeneic stem cell transplant , recurrent significant infection , previous current malignancy within last 5 year ( except : adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix uterus ; basal squamous cell carcinoma skin ; situ carcinoma bladder ; previous malignancy confine surgically resect curative intent ) , toxicity rituximab result permanent discontinuation treatment toxicity ABT263 another Bcl2 family protein inhibitor , significant cardiovascular disease ( e.g. , MI within 6 month ) , renal , neurologic , psychiatric , endocrinologic , metabolic , immunologic hepatic disease would adversely affect participation , severe ( defined Grade 4 and/or require permanent discontinuation prior antibody therapy ) allergic anaphylactic reaction human , humanize , chimeric murine monoclonal antibodies The subject underlying , predispose condition bleed currently exhibit sign clinically significant bleeding . The subject recent history nonchemotherapy induce thrombocytopenic associate bleeding within six month prior first dose study drug . The subject active peptic ulcer disease hemorrhagic esophagitis/gastritis active immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) history refractory platelet transfusion ( within six month prior first dose study drug ) . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding Subject test positive HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C infection , ( Subjects test positive antiHBc ( carrier ) allow enroll ) Evidence clinically significant uncontrolled condition ( ) include , limited : active systemic fungal infection ; diagnosis fever neutropenia within one week prior study drug administration Received steroid therapy antineoplastic intent within seven day prior first dose study drug , receive aspirin within seven day prior first dose study drug , CYP3A inhibitor ( e.g. , ketoconazole , clarithromycin ) within 7 day prior administration first dose study drug , radioimmunotherapy within six month prior first dose study drug , receive anticancer therapy within fourteen day prior first dose study drug .</criteria>
