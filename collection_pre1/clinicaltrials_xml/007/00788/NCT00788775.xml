	<brief_summary>Given poor prognosis limit treatment option available patient mucosal acral/lentiginous melanoma develop metastatic disease , genetic discovery KIT mutation cancer present need test multi-targeted kinase inhibitor potent KIT inhibitory activity patient population . Imatinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) potential effective patient population , patient may develop resistance treatment . Therefore , study , propose test nilotinib patient metastatic mucosal , acral , chronically sun-damaged melanoma follow treatment another TKI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nilotinib TKI Resistant Intolerant Patients With Metastatic Mucosal , Acral , Chronically Sun Damaged Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary * To estimate proportion patient , metastatic mucosal , acral , chronically sun damage melanoma , whose tumor KIT aberration , progress could tolerate KIT target tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) ( e.g . include limited imatinib mesylate , sunitinib , dasatanib ) , alive without progression disease four month begin treatment nilotinib . Secondary - To determine early evidence biologic clinical activity best overall response rate . - To estimate time progression disease overall survival . - To determine tolerability nilotinib . - To evaluate use FDG-PET scanning determine early biologic response therapy . - To correlate c-kit mutational status amplification status response therapy . - To evaluate feasibility nilotinib . - To evaluate tolerability nilotinib patient brain metastasis .</detailed_description>
