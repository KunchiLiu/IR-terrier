	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radioactive drug , radioactive iodine , may carry radiation directly tumor cell harm normal cell . Placing gene call Ad5CMV-NIS prostate cancer cell may help prostate cell take radioactive iodine thus kill cancer cell . Drugs , liothyronine sodium , may protect thyroid side effect radioactive iodine . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose gene therapy give together radioactive iodine treat patient locally recurrent prostate cancer respond external-beam radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine safety tolerance Ad5CMV-NIS administer intraprostatically follow radioiodine treatment patient locally recurrent adenocarcinoma prostate follow external beam radiotherapy . - To determine maximum tolerate dose Ad5CMV-NIS patient . Secondary - To evaluate PSA response rate , duration , time PSA progression patient . - To evaluate immune response Ad5CMV-NIS . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study Ad5CMV-NIS . Patients receive intraprostate Ad5CMV-NIS , via transperineal injection anesthesia , day 1 . They receive dosimetry oral iodine I 123 day 4 undergo image study periodically next 24 hour measurement radioiodine uptake . Patients receive therapeutic oral iodine I 131 day 5 . All patient intact thyroid gland ( i.e. , previously surgically remove ablate ) receive TSH suppressive dos oral liothyronine sodium 3 time daily 10 day prior 15 day post administration iodine I 123 . Blood sample collect periodically measurement PSA , fT4 , TSH ; peripheral blood cell monitor evidence virus DNA via quantitative reverse-transcriptase-PCR . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 8 year . A transrectal tumor biopsy perform 3 month 1 year post-treatment .</detailed_description>
