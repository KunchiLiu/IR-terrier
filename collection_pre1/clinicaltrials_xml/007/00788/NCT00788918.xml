	<brief_summary>Patients HCV infection often suffer chronic fatigue , depression reduce cognition , even evolve severe liver fibrosis , liver cirrhosis hepatic encephalopathy . It currently unclear extent symptom er due direct pathological effect virus , due pre-existing psychiatric disease . There complex relationship prior exist drug abuse , psychiatric disease HCV infection , make difficult establish cause-effect relationship . A biological mechanism suggest contribute development cerebral dysfunction patient . According prevail Trojan Horses hypothesis circulate lymphocyte cross blood brain barrier carry HCV central nervous system virus subsequently replicate macrophage microglia brain separate compartment . As part immunological response viral replication , neurodegenerative process take place harmful effect neural circuit cerebral function . Identification HCV RNA negative strand , replication product , brain tissue HCV patient , part autopsy study , support hypothesis . Moreover , HCV patient also observe abnormal metabolic concentration frontal white substance basal ganglia MRI spectroscopy compare control group . The overall study objective assess cerebral function particular emphasis cognitive function HCV patient ( genotype 1,2,3 4 ) use neuropsychiatric test battery . Furthermore , patient examine MRI , include magnetization transfer , diffusion tensor contrast perfusion , order perform measurement cerebral volumetric microstructure . Finally , HCV analysis , include viral sequence cytokine profile , serum cerebrospinal fluid carry study population .</brief_summary>
