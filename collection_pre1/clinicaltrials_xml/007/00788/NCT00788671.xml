	<brief_title>Levonorgestrel Intrauterine Device ( IUD ) Treat Complex Atypical Hyperplasia ( CAH ) Grade 1 Endometrioid Endometrial Carcinoma ( G1EEC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Levonorgestrel IUD : The levonorgestrel IUD T-shaped birth control device make flexible plastic . It design prevent pregnancy release hormone call levonorgestrel , type progesterone . Progesterone common type hormone use prevent pregnancy . In study , levonorgestrel intrauterine device test treatment hyperplasia and/or early-stage cancer line uterus . Study Surgery IUD Placement : If find eligible take part study , surgical procedure perform Day 1 study ( within 1 week screening test ) . The procedure call dilation curettage , purpose confirm diagnosis . First complete pelvic exam , line uterus scrap operating room order remove sample tissue . The tissue sample use find exact diagnosis . Women previously undergone dilation curettage ( D &amp; C ) diagnosis undergo second D &amp; C . The Levonorgestrel IUD place clinic . During surgery , low risk pain procedure , receive general anesthesia . The cervix area may also numb anesthetic . You ask sign separate consent form surgical procedure , procedure risk explain detail time . At time surgery , levonorgestrel IUD insert uterus , remain place . Study Visits : After IUD place , return clinic follow study visit . About one ( 1 ) week surgery , study staff review surgery pathology result . If result show change diagnosis hyperplasia early-stage cancer , re-assessed eligibility study . If still eligible , chest x-ray MRI abdomen . These scan perform check status disease . If pathology result show disease outside uterus , unable take part study . The LIUD remove operating room surgery removal disease outside uterus . You may also LIUD remove clinic . About one ( 1 ) month surgery , visit check placement LIUD . This visit may office local doctor 's office , whichever prefer . Placement LIUD check first pelvic exam . In addition , may ultrasound uterus confirm location LIUD . If IUD correct location , replace visit . At Months 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 surgery , follow procedure perform : - You ask side effect may experience . - You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your medical history record . - You biopsy line uterus . To perform biopsy , small plastic tube place uterus . The tube scrape tissue sample line uterus . Biomarker Testing : The leftover tissue study surgery test biomarkers ( chemical `` marker '' tissue may relate response study drug , levonorgestrel ) . This biomarker test also perform tissue leftover uterine line biopsy Month 3 . Length Study Participation : The first part study last 12 month , levonorgestrel IUD remain uterus time . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect time , take study levonorgestrel IUD remove . In case , would need return follow-up study visit describe . Instead , would visit primary gynecologic oncologist ( regular doctor disease ) , discuss different treatment option disease . At Month 12 study , ask want keep levonorgestrel IUD place . If choose levonorgestrel IUD remove Month 12 visit , consider `` study '' Month 12 visit . If choose keep levonorgestrel IUD Month 12 , remain study long levonorgestrel IUD still place . Instead visit study doctor , visit primary gynecologic oncologist . Anytime check-ups biopsy line uterus part routine medical care , long levonorgestrel IUD still place , result check-ups biopsy share study staff use part research study . You remain `` study '' long levonorgestrel IUD still place . You may ask primary gynecologic oncologist remove IUD time . This investigational study . The levonorgestrel IUD commercially available FDA approve form birth control . Its use treatment cancer hyperplasia experimental . At time purpose , use research . Up 70 patient take part multicenter study . Up 50 enrol MD Anderson . Up 20 enrolled Harris Health System .</detailed_description>
