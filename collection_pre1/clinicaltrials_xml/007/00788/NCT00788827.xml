	<brief_summary>This phase I study assess safety tolerability infuse expanded stem cell pancreas patient type I diabetes successful renal transplant . The stem cell use study occur naturally body collected recipient procedure call leukapheresis . The cell expand differentiated insulin-like cell sterile suite inject body tail pancreas recipient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Islet transplantation potential treatment diabetes investigate extensively past 10 year . Such approach , however , always limit mainly difficult obtain sufficiently large number purify islet cadaveric donor . One alternative organ tissue transplantation use renewable source cell . Adult stem cell clonogenic cell capable self-renewal multilineage differentiation . These cell potential proliferate differentiate type cell genetically modify vitro , thus provide cell , isolate used transplantation . Recent study give well-defined differentiation protocol , use guide stem cell specific cell lineage neuron , cardiomyocytes insulin-secreting cell . Moreover , derive cell useful different animal model . In regard , insulin-secreting cell derive R1 mouse embryonic stem cell restore blood glucose concentration normal transplant streptozotocin-induced diabetic animal . Our group isolate stem cell ( CD34 positive subset stem cell ) capable differentiate multiple tissue type ex vivo . In defined condition , culture , 40 percent cell produce insulin reduce blood sugar level streptozotocin-induced mouse . Clinically , perform phase I trial stem cell administration patient liver insufficiency . The procedure well tolerate specific side effect sustain sign clinical benefit . These result support protocol application adult stem cell therapy treatment diabetes . In order evaluate potential clinical application recent advance design prospective Phase I clinical study expand progeny adult CD34 positive subset ( InsulinCytes ) inject directly body tail pancreas participant via selective catheterisation splenic artery . The study group consist patient complicate diabetes mellitus type I plus kidney transplantation aim ascertain whether confers clinical benefit treatment model diabetes . Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) administer suitable patient mobilise haematopoietic stem cell ( HSCs ) bone marrow peripheral circulation . These blood cell collect patient leukapheresis . CD34 positive stem cell isolate immunoselection introduce Nunc cell factory subset CD34 positive stem cell allow attach plastic tray within cell factory 2 hour 37 degree C 5 percent carbon dioxide . After period non-attached CD34 positive cell wash system progeny attach cell secrete supernatant medium expand presence growth medium supplement growth factor . At end 6 day expansion , stem cell differentiate insulin c-peptide protein excrete cell next 14 day addition specify reagents/growth factor continue incubation 37 degree C 5 percent carbon dioxide accordance principle Good Manufacturing Practice . As optional step cell label iron oxide allow track cell Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan , infused patient . An ongoing institute experience liver failure patient infuse undifferentiated stem cell show administer dose 2 x 10 log 9 cell well tolerate . The propose study group consist 10 Type I Type 2 diabetic patient successful previous kidney transplant . The primary purpose study assess safety tolerance stem cell infusion pancreas assess impact new modality treatment diabetes .</detailed_description>
