	<brief_summary>This four-part dose-escalation confirmation study participant advance solid tumor . Part A dose escalation determination maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) MK-4827 . Part B prostate/ovarian cancer cohort expansion . Part C cohort participant relapse refractory T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( T-PLL ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Part D cohort participant locally advance metastatic colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) , persistent recurrent endometrial carcinoma , locally advanced metastatic triple negative highly proliferative estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancer , partially platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer . The study also design find whether MK-4827 cause least 50 % inhibition poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase ( PARP ) enzyme activity .</brief_summary>
