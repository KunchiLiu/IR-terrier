	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know combination chemotherapy regimen effective treat patient undergone surgery high-risk colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study chemotherapy give surgery treat patient high-risk stage II stage III colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy After Surgery Treating Patients With High-Risk Stage II Stage III Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess efficacy compare associate toxicity adjuvant chemotherapy last 12 week vs 24 week patient fully resect high-risk stage II III colorectal cancer . - To conduct economic analysis cost effectiveness regimen . - To compare randomization methodology use study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center 's recruitment potential . Patients randomize ( within 10 week surgery receive 12 week chemotherapy ) 1 2 treatment arm . The treatment regimen patient receives ( Oxaliplatin Modified DeGramont [ OxMdG ] XELOX ) determine participate center . - Arm I : Patients receive 12 course OxMdG ( describe ) XELOX ( describe ) combination chemotherapy ( 6 additional course patient already receive 6 course ) treatment last total 24 week . - Arm II : Patients receive 6 course OxMdG XELOX combination chemotherapy ( additional course patient already receive 6 course ) treatment last total 12 week . The two adjuvant combination chemotherapy regimens administer follow : - OxMdG : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - XELOX : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete quality-of-life assessment periodically use EORTC QLQ-C30 , EORTC QLQ-CR29 , EQ-5D , GOG Ntx4 questionnaire . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 7 year .
