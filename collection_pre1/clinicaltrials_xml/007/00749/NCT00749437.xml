	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Placing gold marker area tumor remove may help doctor well direct radiation therapy help reduce risk cancer recurrence . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study well radiation therapy use gold marker work treat woman early-stage breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Using Gold Markers Treating Women With Early-Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine delivery external-beam accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) base gold fiducial marker accurate compare delivery radiotherapy base bony anatomy woman early-stage , node-negative breast cancer . Secondary - To assess migration fiducial marker course APBI . - To quantify change volume seroma ( lumpectomy ) cavity course APBI . - To compare overall operative time suture fiducial marker place vs current standard method place surgical clip . OUTLINE : Patients undergo plan lumpectomy gold fiducial marker placement ( procedure already perform ) . Patients meet post lumpectomy criterion continue treatment study proceed accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) . Between 15-80 day surgery , patient undergo 3-dimensional APBI ( may intensity-modulated radiotherapy ) use CT-guided planning ( gold fiducial marker place lumpectomy ) daily , 5 day week , 15 day . Patients undergo fluoroscopy weekly determine real-time movement bony anatomy fiducial marker cone-beam CT weekly determine change volume seroma cavity .</detailed_description>
