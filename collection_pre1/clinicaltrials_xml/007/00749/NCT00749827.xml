	<brief_summary>Contrast induce nephropathy ( CIN ) term apply acute renal failure associate intravascular injection iodinate contrast agent typically use cardiac angiography . CIN occur 15 % cardiac angiography , dialysis require 0.5 % case . The development CIN associate adverse outcome include major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) death . The mechanism underlie association MACE death unclear largely unknown whether measure reduce frequency severity CIN also reduce associated adverse event . The cause CIN human know , many preventive therapy test base understand mechanism underlie CIN animal model . Despite multiple study , one drug therapy proven consistently prevent CIN time . Prophylactic fluid therapy uniformly recommend component preventive approach CIN . However , optimal type , dose duration fluid therapy remain unclear . Existing study suggest role isotonic saline [ 3 ] bicarbonate [ 4 ] . Initial use hypotonic fluid follow isotonic fluid might allow rapid sustained increase tubular fluid flow suppression ADH . This assist reduce tubular fluid viscosity potential injury contrast medium . The aim research program design test strategy prevention CIN patient undergo elective cardiac angiography percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . The primary purpose pilot study determine biological plausibility use hypotonic solution CIN prophylaxis . Specific Objectives : Primary 1 . To compare effect two fluid prophylaxis strategy CIN urine output , urine pH , urine composition ( urine metabolic profiling ) , novel marker renal injury ( NGAL ) urine osmolality Secondary 2 . To assess relative sensitivity definition CIN base change serum creatinine cystatin C within 72 hour post contrast . 3 . To determine feasibility future multicenter randomize trial hypotonic fluid prophylaxis strategy prevention radiocontrast nephropathy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design We propose pilot randomize trial evaluate type fluid choose CIN prophylaxis . This study conduct Health Sciences Centre , St. John 's , University Alberta Hospital , Edmonton . Proposed Interventions : Bicarbonate hydration arm . Intravenous sodium bicarbonate ( 130 mEq per L ) 4.35 % dextrose 3.5 ml per Kg 1 hour pre-contrast , follow solution intravenously 1 ml/Kg/hr 6 hour . Hypotonic hydration arm . Intravenous 5 % dextrose water 3.5 ml per Kg 1 hour pre-contrast follow 0.9 % saline intravenously 1 ml per Kg per hr 6 hour . In case maximum rate fluid permit body weight 110 Kg . Intra-vascular low-osmolal iso-osmolal contrast ( accord operator institution choice ) use minimal dose need complete require imaging . Patient population The patient population study limit urban dweller meet follow inclusion exclusion criterion . Our rationale limit study urban dweller blood urine sample NGAL need frozen -70 shipping , therefore test need do site storage peripheral lab . Duration Treatment Follow Active treatment limit hour patient cardiac catheterization laboratory . Patients follow 7 day post intervention . They ask provide urine and/or blood sample collect baseline , pre-catheterization , 2 6 , 24 , 48-72 hour post-angiography . They follow telephone 7 day post intervention determine experience adverse event related procedure intervention . Measures Baseline Information Baseline measure include demographic information , comorbidity , location , indication cardiac procedure , type procedure perform . Detailed information angiographic procedure record include type volume parenteral contrast use . In addition accurate information regard baseline blood pressure , use medication ( specifically ACE inhibitor , angiotensin receptor blocker , NSAIDS , diuretic ) record well evaluation know risk factor CIN . Outcome Measures Blood collect measurement serum creatinine cystatin C baseline prior fluid administration , 6 , 24 48-72 hour post-angiography . Urine sample measurement urine pH , osmolality , electrolytes creatinine , NGAL well metabolic profile collect patient baseline , pre cardiac catheterization , 6 hour postcardiac catheterization , end hydration period . As majority patient indwell urinary catheter , urine sample collect close time point possible . A table sample collection timepoints append application . Assays perform stored sample single laboratory ensure assay standardization site . Duration hospitalization ( ) determine review record . Data collection Identification potential participant feasible review data collect pre-admission purpose site 's catheterization laboratory . Study investigator work collaboratively catheterization lab identify screen potential participant . Following introduction clinical staff , potential participant approach study nurse site , either day day prior cardiac angiography . The study nurse obtain consent , collect baseline information blood urine specimen , contact local investigator randomization . Once patient randomize study nurse arrange administration study therapy provide patient requisition follow blood work . The study investigator contact patient either person hospitalize phone discharge post procedure remind specimen collection time point . Sample Size This study exploratory nature therefore power specific endpoint . Previous study area demonstrate positive result sample sizes order 50 -100 subject . We plan enroll 100 patient study . Statistical Analysis Analysis intention treat . P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Given pilot study interim analysis . 1 . Effect intervention urinary outcomes The difference treatment group analyze use linear regression model . Estimates correspond 95 % confidence interval report . Additional covariates explore . Residual , leverage influence diagnostics examine . As metabolic profile relatively new technology patient serve control result report paired test , describe change metabolism associate radiocontrast administration . Attempts make determine fluid type influence change metabolic profile compare treatment arm use linear regression technique . 2 . Relationship change NGAL serum creatinine cystatin C Diagnostic statistic ( sensitivity , specificity , ROC curve ) also explore change NGAL level 24 hour use common definition CIN reference standard ( 44umol/L 25 % rise serum creatinine 72 hour post contrast ) . Additionally , different time point ( 4 48 hour ) NGAL level consider . Data management Dr. Barrett Dr. Pannu oversee data management study . Blood urine collect stored -70C locally participate center , appropriate storage facility</detailed_description>
