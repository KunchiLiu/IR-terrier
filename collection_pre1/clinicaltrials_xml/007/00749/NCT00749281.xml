	<brief_summary>Serum NGAL describe biomarker neutrophil activation inflammatory marker correlate obesity metabolic complication . Since neutrophil activation implicate pathogenesis coronary artery disease , investigator hypothesize serum NGAL level would high patient CAD serum concentration would correlate extent CAD document coronary angiography , serve potential biomarker severity CAD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inflammation consider play major role coronary artery disease ( CAD ) account high morbidity mortality rate western world . Several line evidence support role neutrophil development atherosclerosis progression . Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) , also know Lipocalin-2 , 25-kDa secretory glycoprotein originally identify mouse kidney cell human neutrophil granule . This protein use marker neutrophil activation several study , recently find inflammatory marker closely related obesity metabolic complication . Recently , lactoferrin , protein co-localizes NGAL specific granule human neutrophil propose dynamic marker neutrophil activation compare widely use myeloperoxidase patient CAD . In line accumulate evidence , study design investigate relationship serum NGAL concentration presence severity coronary artery disease accord coronary angiography .</detailed_description>
