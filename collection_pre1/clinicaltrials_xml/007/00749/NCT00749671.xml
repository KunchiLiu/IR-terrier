	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND Physician-guided moderate sedation , administer Registered Nurse standard practice patient undergo wide range electrophysiology procedure past decade . Currently subjective sedation assessment tool standard practice within Electrophysiology Lab ( EP Lab ) . Bispectral Index monitoring ( BIS ) objective measure depth sedation presently employ Baystate Medical Center Intensive Care Unit within department anesthesia . AIM The aim research study assess utility BIS monitoring measure depth sedation patient undergoing defibrillation threshold testing ( DFT ) . Our primary endpoint : A change OAAS score one point 30 minute data collection time period . Our secondary endpoint : Lack explicit recall DFT test measurement perioperative level comfort . STUDY DESIGN AND SCOPE The population study patient receive primary ICD implant ICD battery change defibrillation threshold testing ( DFT ) . All patient consent ICD placement DFT test moderate sedation invite participate research study . Patients candidate DFT testing , determine EP physician , exclude study . Demographic data include : age , gender , BMI , current medication history sleep apnea collect . Data detail amount drug administer procedure use reversal agent , retrieve medical record . The study conduct within Electrophysiology lab Baystate Medical Center . An enrollment 60 subject expect complete within 6 month . 30 patient originate outpatient population 30 inpatient . Follow assessment use OAAS scale complete 30 min , 1 hour 4 hour post procedure . Also , perioperative comfort recall DFT test assess 4 hour mark .</brief_summary>
