	<brief_title>Pilot Study Patients With Poor Response Deferasirox</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose trial examine three potential mechanism inadequate response Exjade® patient transfusion dependent iron overload include patient thalassemia syndrome , sickle cell disease bone marrow failure . Hypothesis : Patients physiologic barrier adequately respond deferasirox may include absorption , pharmacokinetics drug metabolism , hepatic clearance and/or genetic factor . Study objectives Primary objective - To evaluate three potential mechanism inadequate response deferasirox small cohort patient hemoglobinopathy . - Oral pharmacokinetics measure Cmax AUC follow standard dose deferasirox . - Hepatobiliary excretory function - Accessibility chelatable iron pool deferoxamine challenge Secondary objective ( ) - To identify risk factor predict adequate response include demographic , disease status , presence severity liver disease , trough level deferasirox outpatient visit pharmacogenomics . - To investigate usefulness potential surrogate measure response include serum deferasirox level , HIDA-nuclear medicine scan evaluate hepatic excretory function urinary iron excretion deferoxamine challenge . This investigator-initiated , pilot-scale , open-label physiological assessment patient respond poorly deferasirox compare patient respond well . We plan study 2 group patient : ) 10 patient demonstrate poor response b ) 5 control patient good response define protocol . The study two part . Part I : Both group patient inpatient physiological assessment dose 35mg/kg deferasirox . Part II : Inadequate responder eligible continue deferasirox continue dose 35 mg/kg three month time serial pharmacokinetic level study . The control patient resume previous clinically appropriate dosing ( likely less 35 mg/kg ) three month serial pharmacokinetic level draw well . The study begin outpatient screen visit demographic historical information well physical examination obtain review eligibility . At visit patient able sign inform consent . Shortly thereafter patient admit GCRC Children 's Hospital Boston part I study , 2-3 day stay PK nuclear medicine study perform well deferoxamine urinary iron excretion challenge . Patients eligible continue part II study , 3 month monitor compliance , PK ferritin change appropriate deferasirox dos .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Part I : Inclusion criterion Inadequate responder Male female patient transfusion dependent iron overload include patient thalassemia syndrome , sickle cell disease bone marrow failure . Patients currently Desferal ( desferrioxamine ) therapy require one day wash prior first dose study drug . Dose deferasirox : &gt; 30 mg/kg/day deferasirox least 3 month No improvement worsen liver iron content ( LIC ) evaluate deferasirox 3 month precede baseline study . Age great 6 year Serum Ferritin : Ferritin &gt; 1500 ng/ml rise three month period deferasirox . Patients achieve 'failure ' describe previously may may currently deferasirox may currently adequate response dose great equal 35 mg/kg/day deferasirox . Life expectancy ≥ 6 month Written inform consent patient pediatric patient consent patient 's legal guardian . The definition term 'pediatric ' enrollment study conduct accordance Children 's Hospital IRB . Parents legal guardian fully inform investigator requirement study . Pediatric patient inform accord capability language term able understand . Written inform consent obtain legal guardian patient 's behalf accordance national legislation .

Part I : Inclusion criterion good responder : Male female patient transfusion dependent iron overload include patient thalassemia syndrome , sickle cell disease bone marrow failure . Patients currently Desferal ( desferrioxamine ) therapy require one day wash prior first dose study drug . Serum ferritin less equal 1000 ng/ml decline 3 month period dose less 30 mg/kg deferasirox .

Exclusion criterion Part I : Pregnancy ( document require screen laboratory test ) breast feed History noncompliance medical regimens patient consider potentially unreliable and/or cooperative Patients transfusion requirement equal frequent every three week . AST ALT &gt; 400 U/L screen Patients uncontrolled systemic hypertension Severe cardiac insufficiency ( NYHA III IV ) , uncontrolled and/or unstable cardiac coronary artery disease control standard medical therapy Patients receive treatment systemic investigational drug within past 4 week topical investigational drug within past 7 day plan receive investigational drug participate study Allergy deferoxamine Known contraindication nuclear medicine study Any condition opinion investigator would prevent completion trial . Prior possible toxicity exclusion criterion Part I patient require chelate agent two Patients find ineligible screening procedure document screen log . No data collect CRF patient . Exclusion criterion Part II : Patients unacceptable toxicity deferasirox renal failure worsen cardiac function Patients fail achieve negative iron balance maximum tolerate dose deferasirox Patients require alternative chelator specific reason Patients currently enrol conflict therapeutic trial Patients serum ferritin less 500 ng/ml screen Any condition opinion investigator would prevent completion trial</criteria>
