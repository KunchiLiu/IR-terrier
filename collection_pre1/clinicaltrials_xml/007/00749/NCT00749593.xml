	<brief_summary>Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia ( CAH ) one commonest inherit disease , affect 1:14,200 live birth . It result genetic defect one enzyme ( case 21-hydroxylase ) require cortisol biosynthesis , lead reduce level cortisol aldosterone , increase ACTH concentration consequently increase adrenal androgen production . Patients suffer problem growth development adult patient may problem fertility , virilisation woman , testicular mass men men woman impair quality life . Patients take life-long therapy . Despite frequency knowledge surround management adult CAH remain fairly limit . There lot work describe management child CAH date consensus manage adult . To address issue number adult endocrinologists UK auspex Society Endocrinology establish country wide study ( CaHASE ) undertake research order set standard care adult patient CAH . In CAH severity symptom experience affected individual varies depend mutation genetic background individual . The ability tailor CAH therapy individual basis , determine severity underlie defect understand likely natural history disease , key goal clinical management . Correlation phenotype ( clinical status ) genotype ( underlie 21 hydroxylase gene mutation ) facilitate stratification severity provide important contribution debate potential mechanism individualise therapy . For instance may become clear certain CAH genotype associate specific long term outcome . In time , could lead suggest different treatment strategy certain group . Moreover , genotype data important address relative contribution environment ( e.g . treatment ) vs. genetics long term outcomes . This multi-centre study aim : 1 . - Investigate medical health adult congenital adrenal hyperplasia . 2 . - Investigate relationship genotype patient phenotype . 3 . - Investigate quality life adult congenital adrenal hyperplasia .</brief_summary>
