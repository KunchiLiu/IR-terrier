	<brief_title>Ketamine Rapid Treatment Post-traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PTSD debilitate anxiety disorder characterize intrusive re-experiences traumatic event , avoidance situation stimulus could serve reminder event , feel jumpy easily startle . Patients PTSD often also depress , many significant memory impairment . Existing drug treatment unsuccessful majority patient , especially combat-related PTSD . Our aim test effectiveness potential new drug PTSD , ketamine . For many year , intravenous ketamine extensively use anesthesia . More recently , use dos low use anesthesia , single ketamine infusion show rapidly reduce depressed mood well anxiety patient severe depression . Some clinical evidence potential efficacy depress patient co-morbid PTSD also exist . Adverse effect study limit feel intoxicate increased blood pressure infusion . In present study , expect single ketamine infusion reduce core PTSD symptom . In addition , patient PTSD depress , expect ketamine reduce depressed mood . Finally , ketamine know impair memory function temporarily . We also test extent ketamine-induced memory impairment infusion predict well people infusion . Forty patient PTSD ( without combat-related trauma history ) test , use design compare effectiveness intravenous ketamine midazolam , another anesthetic drug without know long-term effect anxiety , depress mood , memory function . If ketamine find expect effect , future study may explore additional benefit repeat infusion / alternative intravenous drug administration . Our study may contribute improved function patient PTSD provide new mean rapidly treat debilitate symptom .</detailed_description>
