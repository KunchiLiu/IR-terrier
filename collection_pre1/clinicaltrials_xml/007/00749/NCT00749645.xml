	<brief_title>Efficacy Study FANG ( 30 ) Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Adult Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) common rheumatic disease characterize pain , inflammation reduction joint function . Hands foot commonly affect joint pain cause bring patient RA search medical assistance . Factors cause pain risk physical incapacity still poorly understood . Joint pain RA , generally , profound pain , focalize involve joint . Typically , pain increase joint move decrease joint rest . But , advance form disease , pain persistent patient feel night pain , rigidity pain period inactivity , last 1 hour decrease activity take , i.e . rigidity early morning pain . Clinically , patient present symptom localize sensibility joint , slight edema tissue , bone crepitate heat outer joint . Muscular atrophy without muscular spasm see . In advanced form disease , deformity complete loss joint movement . Analgesic drug , specially non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug NSAIDs play essential role management RA . These drug effective rapid sustain relief pain , time acceptable profile safety tolerability medium long term treatment . However , case gastric intolerance /or renal hepatic dysfunction . The anti-inflammatory effect non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug NSAIDs , mainly due inhibition cyclooxygenase enzyme ( COX ) , need synthesis prostaglandin thromboxanes . Description FANG use clinical trial : FANG ( 30 ) product manufacture FARMINDUSTRIA S.A. , Pharmaceutical Laboratories , Santiago , Chile , form common medicine , accord Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP ) Guidelines &amp; Requirements Institute Public Health Chile ( ISP ) , standardize patent extract A. paniculata , Nees ( Acanthaceae ) , medicinal plant native India China . Its chemical composition principal active compound bitter diterpenic lactones , specially andrographolide , deoxy-andrographolide neoandrographolide , tablet weight 100 mg 30 % active principle . This plant vastly distribute country Southeast Asia use official medicinal plant China India thousand year . It still continue popular medicine treatment different disease . Recently demonstrate possess anti tumoral5 , anti-inflammatory6 antiviral7 effect . Andrographolide particularly efficient regulate immune response 5 , 7 . The molecular cellular mechanism responsible immunomodulating anti-inflammatory property andrographolide , remain still unknown , however , recent vitro vivo study , indicate andrographolide inhibits NFkappaB8 . Specifically , andrographolide concentration 10 µM interferes DNA bind NF-κB reduce expression COX-2 neutrophil induce fMLP PAF . Moreover , andrographolide reduces production IFNγ IL-2 T cell stimulate CON-A , without affect cellular viability induce apoptosis . Also apoptosis induce corticosteroid thymocytes reduce . Andrographolide 14-deoxyandrographolide able inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation T cell neutrophil , respectively 9 , 10 . In inflammatory process , FANG show potent anti-inflammatory effect , reduce production cytokine , derive phospholipid , nitric oxide reactive oxygen specie `` fuel '' chronic inflammation , explain capacity reduce control inflammation , inflammatory pain facilitate induction cellular repair . Clinical Evidence effect A. paniculata : During last decade , A. paniculata become popular Scandinavia treatment common cold . Accumulated evidence indicate reduce severity disease . Various clinical study indicate A. paniculata effective treatment viral infection upper respiratory tract . A meta-analysis 2004 7 double blind control clinical trial meet criterion scientific quality accept meta design , include 896 participant , evaluate efficacy A. paniculata treatment acute respiratory infections11 , indicate combined result , A. paniculata effective placebo reduce symptom common cold . A. paniculata also compare acetaminophen . In double blind randomize study 152 patient fever pharyngeal congestion 12 high dos A. paniculata ( 6 g ) reduce fever sore throat similar manner acetaminophen , without significant secondary effect . In double blind randomize trial , placebo , 107 patient , A. paniculata increase resistance common cold 13 , reduce incidence cold factor 2.1 time compare control group 3 month treatment winter season . Safety Parameters - Toxicity Tolerability FANG : Acute sub-chronic toxicity rodent pig use extract A. paniculata component FANG , perform Institute Pharmacology Toxicology , Universidad Austral de Chile accord Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP ) Food Administration Agency ( FDA ) , show absence adverse effect dose &gt; 20g/kg 90 day treatment . Not genetic , reproductive , immunological , neurological , hematological , metabolic , histopathological toxicity detect either . Also , Phase I clinical trial , participant monitor liver , renal hematological parameter , clinical laboratory secondary effect describe 11 , 13 , 15 . Bio safety study small child , nurse mother , patient renal hepatic damage perform yet . On hand , since A. paniculata stimulate contractibility gall bladder . Therefore , use without medical supervision patient gall bladder pathology . Objective Study : To assess measure anti inflammatory efficacy test natural product contribute learn basic biological mechanism produce effect , adult patient active Rheumatoid Arthritis . Methodology : For purpose , 2 group patient respectively receive random , either inert substance know placebo , group receive test product form coat tablet , three time every day , period study last 14 week . Place Study : National study Chile 2 center , one city Valdivia one city Osorno number 30 patient per centre enrol respective rheumatologist . Population Study : 60 adult individual sex diagnose Active Rheumatoid Arthritis undergo standard treatment include . Individuals chronic acute disease , smoker , alcoholic , diabetic , heart disease , lung disease , neoplastic disease , individual take medicine exclude . Product Study : The experimental FANG ( 30 ) placebo tablet manufacture stored specify , deliver administer propose protocol . Procedure : A total approximately 30 individual assign placebo group , 30 FANG ( 30 ) group . During 14 week , daily take 3 tablet respective randomly assign product . All volunteer allow obtain monthly blood sample simple venipuncture superior arm day 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 120 day treatment . Discomfort derive risk study : Since participant , need take tablet product 3 time day submit extraction 4 blood sample study period , facts represent case , physical emotional discomfort , depend custom individual predisposition type common medical procedure . Adverse Effects : Andrographis paniculata extract toxic manufacture product FANG ( 30 ) prepare GMP pharmaceutical quality request study . The product well tolerated complication report vast available information . However , natural / pharmaceutical product , isolated case , slight risk rush , allergy active principle plant , anyhow , reversible suspension intake product . Moreover , one patient , alteration detect could dangerous inconvenient health condition ; physician offer patient withdraw study . In case severe alteration , rheumatologist withdraw patient study safety reason . Principal expect result : At end study period , participant receive active product FANG ( 30 ) ( Andrographis extract tablet ) , show improvement symptom . Moreover , participant receive placebo show sign change symptom . Any situation health detect course study , relate analyzed parameter , aspect clinical significance , even necessarily include study , duly record informed accordingly . If end result demonstrate FANG ( 30 ) particular case proven beneficial , participate patient ( even receive placebo ) offer rheumatologist free treatment medicine regular modality , next 18 month . Volunteering : Volunteers must absolutely free apply participate , order include study , reason whatsoever nobody oblige person participate condition threat . Moreover , volunteer abandon continue participate study moment without necessity give explanation . This event affect relationship treat physician , neither personnel hospital , relation influence volunteer 's future health care requirement . Volunteers , must consult doubt study invite participate , accept also development study . Insurance Study : Considering previous experience drug , free sale country ; approve Institute Public Health Chile , authorize sell nutraceutical USA , hire specific insurance special risk study consider . Moreover , study special fund payment compensation damage result adverse effect test medicine . Nevertheless , case event nature would happen , volunteer assist procedure therapy require , continue monitor study physician care . In case additional intervention need , derive directly adverse effect study cover regular health insurance system , event also cover insurance policy study . This insurance policy maintain current 4 month completion study . Responsible rheumatologist inform volunteer study , clarify doubt answer question Dr. Verónica I. Aguirre Hospital de Valdivia Dr. Sonia M. Arriagada Hospital de Osorno .</detailed_description>
