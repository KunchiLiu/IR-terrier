	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Erlotinib ( Tarceva ) Transitional Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Erlotinib hydrochloride design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , begin take erlotinib hydrochloride ( pill ) mouth day . You take time day , least 1 hour 2 hour meal . You swallow pill cup ( 8 ounce ) water . It important take drug every day , prescribe . If necessary study , study doctor may decide low dose . Study Visits : Once week study , follow test perform take study drug : - Your vital sign measure . - You ask side effect may experience . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Length Study Participation : You may continue receive study drug 3-5 week ( depend surgery schedule ) . After , offer surgery remove tumor . You take last study drug dose within 24 hour surgery . You sign separate consent form surgery , procedure risk describe detail time . If disease get bad intolerable side effect occur , take study early . If stop take study drug early intolerable side effect , need return clinic every 2 week surgery . At visit , side effect monitor , example routine blood test and/or scan , depend doctor decides necessary . Long-Term Follow-Up : After surgery , study participant return routine follow-up visit surgeon . Every 6 month first year surgery year next 4 year , study staff call see . This investigational study . Erlotinib hydrochloride FDA approve commercially available treatment non-small cell lung cancer pancreatic cancer . Its use study investigational FDA approve . For purpose , time use research . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologic proof urothelial cancer . This include bladder cancer , addition tumor urothelial line include renal pelvis , ureteral , urethral cancer . This group may include patient require cystectomy , include patient recurrent extensive superficial disease ( cTaT1N0M0 ) , CIS ( carcinoma situ ) , muscle invasive disease ( cT23aN0M0 ) , whose tumor could completely remove transurethral resection . 2 . Patients follow highrisk feature : Micropapillary feature ( focal pathology ) ; Small cell carcinoma ; 3D mass exam anesthesia ( EUA ) ; Lymphovascular invasion ; Hydronephrosis ( unless opinion treat physician , due tumor ) ; High grade ( grade 3 ) tumor ureter , renal pelvis , urethra , tumor area radiographic abnormality large enough recognize abnormal mass CT MRI imaging ; 3 . ( # 2 cont 'd ) Direct invasion prostatic stroma vaginal wall ( ie : cT4a disease ) offer neoadjuvant cytoreductive chemotherapy ( ie : cisplatinbased ) . Patients refuse consider candidate cytoreductive chemotherapy may consider eligible . Dr. SiefkerRadtke final arbiter determine eligibility trial . 4 . Please note presence variant histologic subtypes acceptable , except case small cell variant traditionally treat cytoreductive chemotherapy . Patients small cell refuse recommend cytoreductive chemotherapy may still consider eligible . 5 . Patients must evaluation department urology , deem acceptable surgical candidate . 6 . Patients must NOT clinical evidence metastatic disease either CT MRI abdomen pelvis , chest xray . In absence bone scan , patient free bone pain alkaline phosphatase &lt; 1.5 x ULN upper limit normal , normal bone fraction alkaline phosphatase . If feature present , patient bone scan interpreted show evidence metastatic disease order eligible . 7 . Individuals must &gt; 18 year age . In general , urothelial cancer occur 6th 7th decade life , unlikely pediatric patient include . 8 . Patients , 18 year old , must either child bear potential negative pregnancy test within 2 week treatment . Patients consider child bear potential surgically sterile ( undergone hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . 9 . Bone marrow function : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1,000/ul ; platelet &gt; /= 75,000/microliters . 10 . Renal function : creatinine &lt; /= 2.0 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) , creatinine clearance &gt; 30 ml/min calculate CockcroftGault 24hour urine collection . 11 . Hepatic function : bilirubin &lt; /= 2.5 x ULN ; AST &lt; /= 5.0 x ULN . 12 . Zubrod PS &lt; /= 2 . 13 . Patients second malignancy eligible provide expect outcome second cancer interfere delivery therapy , cystectomy , provide expectation survival prior malignancy reliably &gt; 4 year . 1 . Acute hepatitis know HIV . 2 . Active uncontrolled infection . 3 . Significant history uncontrolled cardiac disease ; i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction ( within prior 6 month ) , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy decrease ejection fraction &lt; /= 40 % . 4 . Prior therapy specifically directly target EGFR pathway . 5 . Patients interstitial lung disease . 6 . Any concurrent chemotherapy indicate study protocol investigational agent ( ) . 7 . Patients metastatic surgically unresectable disease eligible study . In addition , patient agree surgery eligible trial . 8 . Patients receive prior systemic chemotherapy radiation therapy urothelial cancer eligible . Any prior intravesical chemotherapy allow .</criteria>
