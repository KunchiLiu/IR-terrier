	<brief_title>fMRI Studies Emotional Brain Circuitry People With Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder recurrent problem many people , interfere ability function normally day-to-day life . Although research show activation certain brain area correspond certain emotional function , well know specific change brain functioning relate caused depression . A proposed theory hold depression relate abnormal regulation emotion thought . This study focus particularly brain circuit involve emotional regulation , include amygdala , affective division anterior cingulate ( ACad ) , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) . The amygdala detects critical emotional information , especially threat ; ACad judge relevance motivational cue , detects conflict , regulate emotional response ; DLPFC critical role support wide range cognitive control function . This study compare brain scan people without depression attempt clarify change brain functioning related depression . Participation study last 8 week . All participant undergo initial screen telephone interview , diagnostic interview brief physical examination . After pass screening , participant schedule functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan . The fMRI scan , last approximately 2 hour , take picture brain structure brain functioning different task . Also visit outside fMRI scanner , participant ask complete additional 2 hour tasks computer . Depressed participant give escitalopram , approve drug treatment depression . Participants take escitalopram go scheduled doctor 's visit 2 , 4 , 6 week treatment ass health , effectiveness drug , side effect . On eighth week , participant undergo fMRI scan computer test . At initial follow-up fMRI study visit , image brain function anatomy record , heart rate monitor , anxiety arousal measure computer test .</detailed_description>
