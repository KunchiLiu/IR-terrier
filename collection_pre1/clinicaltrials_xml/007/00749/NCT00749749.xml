	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety CollaRx Bupivacaine Implant Compared ON-Q Painbuster Following Abdominal Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hysterectomy second common surgery among woman United States ( US ) . Abdominal hysterectomy surgery may perform treat benign tumor , fibroid , heavy period , painful period chronic pelvic pain . The common route perform hysterectomy incision abdominal wall ; however , 20 % perform vaginally.Laparoscopic assist vaginal hysterectomy perform warrant . Bupivacaine local anesthetic ( pain medication ) establish safety profile . Collagen protein find mammal . The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant thin flat sponge make collagen come cattle tendon contain bupivacaine . When inserted surgical site , collagen break bupivacaine release site little absorbed blood stream . The high level bupivacaine surgical site may result less pain several day surgery . The ON Q system consist 1 elastometric pump fill volume 270 mL contain 0.25 % bupivacaine ; 1 soaker catheter measure 12.5 cm size ; fill port , tube , clamp , filter flow restrictor . The pump provide positive pressure portable . It may attach patient 's dressing place carry pouch . The catheter insert directly surgical wound provide continuous flow bupivacaine wound . A capillary flow restrict orifice locate end tubing control flow rate . This study compare total narcotic use patient CollaRx Bupivacaine Implant total narcotic use patient ON Q PainBuster Post op Pain Relief System abdominal hysterectomy .</detailed_description>
