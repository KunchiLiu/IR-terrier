	<brief_summary>Background Sleep disturbance prevalent hospitalize adult patient manifest reduced sleep time sleep efficiency well increased awakening . Insomnia frequent sleep disturbance . The effect change sleep pattern child prior elective surgery evaluate objectively . Sleep hospital may influence biological process related circadian rhythm . Melatonin hormone secrete pineal gland diurnal rhythm regulate light- light suppresses melatonin secretion , darkness enhances . Melatonin chrono-biotic sleep promoting property . Exogenous administration melatonin shorten sleep latency , increase sleep efficiency total sleep time . Melatonin also improve disrupted circadian rhythm . Melatonin promote sleep similar way natural sleep process , maintain normal sleep architecture . Melatonin positive effect child sleep disturbance routinely administrate pediatric sleep center around world insomnia variety sleep disorder . Side effect melatonin rare scarce . Circadin slow release formulation melatonin , mimic night time secretion natural melatonin . Children sleep disorder treat controlled release melatonin , demonstrate improvement sleep latency total sleep time . It reasonable assume hospitalize child disturb sleep pattern prior follow elective surgery . We hypothesize melatonin improve sleep pattern prior follow surgery , reduce sleep latency extend total sleep time . We also hypothesize improvement positive impact anesthetic stress measure recovery . The purpose study : 1 . To characterize sleep pattern child undergo surgery admission night prior surgery ; 2 . To evaluate effect melatonin sleep parameter night prior surgery child ; 3 . To evaluate effect melatonin physiologic stress parameter anesthesia surgery child ; 4 . To evaluate effect melatonin sleep parameter child postoperatively ; 5 . To evaluate effect melatonin postoperative outcome measure child . Patients , Methods . Ninety child ( age 4-18 year ) evaluate . Sleep disorder screen pediatric sleep questionnaire . Sleep assess sleep log actigraphy sleep onset time , sleep latency , total sleep time , total wake time , number length awakening , sleep efficiency , sleep fragmentation index sleep mean activity score . Recovery measure include : length hospitalization , infection rate , body temperature , cortisol level , cooperation medical staff . Study plan . The research comprise 5 consecutive step . Step 1 include week prior surgery include sleep evaluation participant sleep log actigraphy . Step 2 night prior surgery include sleep log actigraphy . 30 child receive melatonin ( Circadin ) 2mg , 30 child receive placebo 30 child constitute control group . Step 3 conduct anesthesia surgery stress variable need anesthesia record . Step 4 take place post-operative hospitalization include actigraphy sleep log . Step 5 take place home two week discharge include actigraphy sleep log .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data participant collect medical record include : demographic data , gender , clinical background . Underlying sleep disorder screen accept validated sleep questionnaire [ 28 ] ( appendix A ) The study consist 5 sequential continual step : step 1 - week prior admission hospital ; step 2 - night surgery ; step 3 - anesthesia surgery ; step 4 - post operative hospital stay ; step 5 - home , 2 week discharge . Step 1 : 90 patient undergo sleep evaluation actigraphy sleep log ( appendix B ) , 7 day prior surgery usual sleep environment home . Step 2 : patient divide 3 study group double-blind , placebo-controlled randomization : 1 . Thirty child receive melatonin ( Circadin ) 2 mg , one hour bedtime consist study group A . 2 . Thirty age , gender disease match control receive placebo consist placebo group A . 3 . Thirty age , gender disease match child receive anything ( control group ) . Actigraphy completion sleep questionnaire also perform hospital night prior surgery . Step 3 : stress assessment anesthesia surgery assess follow variable routinely monitor record surgery MDsoft computerize system : heart rate , blood pressure , end-tidal CO2 , amount anesthetic agent , opiate consumption . Step 4 : actigraphy completion sleep questionnaire perform night post-surgery hospital stay period 1 week post-surgery . Step 5 : two week discharge , additional follow-up sleep log actigraphy perform 5 consecutive night . Practically , child recruit triplicate triple consist gender , age type surgery . By randomization assign one study group . Post operatively , pair patient study group A placebo group A ( include control group ) randomly re-divided two new group : study group B - child receive melatonin every night control group B receive placebo every night one hour bedtime rest hospitalization . Sleep evaluation : Sleep evaluate sleep log diary sleep variable complete parent night ( appendix B ) actigraphy . Actigraphy An actigraph watch-like device place wrist . It noninvasive continuous ambulatory measure use objectively evaluate sleep . The use actigraphy clinical research purpose well establish . Actigraphy reliable valid tool detect disturbed sleep useful technique evaluation insomnia circadian rhythm disorder [ 10 ] . It accept common technique child [ 29 ] routinely use pediatric sleep clinic .</detailed_description>
