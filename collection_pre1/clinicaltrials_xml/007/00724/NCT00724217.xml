	<detailed_description>Elevated low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol concentration risk factor cardiovascular disease . ( 1 ) Cholesterol lower drug frequently prescribe medication U.S. known muscle , kidney liver side effect user . Recent review conclude benefit outweigh risk report statin cholesterol-lowering drug safe effective user . ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) The new blood cholesterol level guideline may recommend people take cholesterol lower medication . According American Heart Association ( AHA ) , total cholesterol level 180 mg/dL , level 200 mg/dL 239 mg/dL consider borderline high . Total cholesterol 240 mg/dL consider high . ( 6 ) However , publish study effect blood lipid suggest actual cholesterol level important risk factor . It ratio level total cholesterol HDL play major role cardiovascular risk . The ideal HDL/cholesterol ratio high 25 % . The ideal triglyceride/cholesterol ratio 2.0 . It estimate 50 million adult U.S. lipid level high recommendation . ( 6 ) For person prefer conservative care , dietary modification consider first approach treatment control high cholesterol . ( 1 , 7 , 8 ) Hypertension another risk factor cardiovascular disease close link high blood cholesterol . ( 8 ) Between 40 50 million Americans hypertension , define systolic blood pressure least 140 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure least 90 mm Hg . ( 8 ) Hypertension strongly , continuously , independently relate coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , stroke , renal disease , all-cause mortality . For every 7.5-mm Hg increase diastolic blood pressure , CAD risk increase 29 % stroke risk increase 46 % . These risk show woman well men . Even within high-normal blood pressure range , high measurement result great risk cardiovascular disease . ( 9-10 ) It report diet nutritional supplement effective reduce elevate blood pressure reduce risk heart attack stroke . ( 11-15 ) Diet supplement also show effect reduce blood cholesterol . ( 16 , 17 ) Traditional dietary control focus reduce intake saturate fat cholesterol . Recent study suggest traditional focus lipid management may overly simplistic diet might effective attention give include certain food factor rather avoid saturate fat cholesterol . Gardner et al 2005 report improved result plant-based food , whole grain , vegetable , legume , fruit simultaneously limit saturate fat cholesterol . ( 17 ) It report nutritional supplement diet reduce serum lipid blood pressure . There report effect nutritional supplement HRV despite close link autonomic nervous system activity regulation blood pressure . The Standard Process 21 day Purification Program consist control food intake regimen mostly fruit vegetable restrict calorie , protein fat plus daily use herbal whole food base supplement . A recent case series 28 chiropractic patient show use SPPP result significantly lower total cholesterol . ( 18 ) . This study investigate effect SPPP participant elevate total cholesterol . The program require subject eat modify ; mostly fruit vegetable diet take SPPP nutritional supplement three week The outcome measure study support literature risk factor cardiovascular condition , e.g. , serum lipid , C - reactive protein , homocystine , blood pressure , high BMI heart rate variability ( HRV ) .</detailed_description>

Both male female subject age 1865 include study . Exclusion criterion base factor could interfere effect SPPP outcome measure and/or safety participant follow : Individuals diabetes , heart , kidney , thyroid disorder , neurological disease , chronic disease exclude study .
