	<brief_summary>The current standard negative pressure wound therapy Vacuum Assisted Closure Device ( VAC ) , commercial system utilizes computerized suction pump apply negative pressure open-cell poly-urethane foam dress seal wound . The VAC system effective drawback : - The system expensive . - There u conflict data effectiveness VAC therapy infect wound . - VAC therapy difficult use ( frequently fail ) wound excess fluid drainage , wound near body orifice . Over past 4 year , accumulate additional experience negative pressure wound therapy use wall suction apply seal gauze dressing 30 patient . We call method G-SUC use unable maintain dress seal VAC system ( due excess drainage wound location ) , management infected wound . We find method effective without specific negative side effect . Our specific aim : 1 . Compare effectiveness G-SUC standard VAC therapy . Outcomes measured method include proportional change wind size 1 - 2 week . 2 . Compare effectiveness G-SUC VAC system control wound infection measure number patient able clear infection 4 day . 3 . Compare failure method therapy document number dress maintain fluid suction . 4 . Measure compare cost wound treatment two method include direct cost time spend bed side perform dress change . Our hypothesis : 1 . G-SUC VAC equivalent treatment uncomplicated wound acute care , in-patient setting . 2 . G-SUC effective VAC management infect wound . 3 . G-SUC versatile VAC , functional G-SUC dressing maintain situation functional VAC dressing . 4 . Negative pressure therapy G-SUC less costly VAC .</brief_summary>
