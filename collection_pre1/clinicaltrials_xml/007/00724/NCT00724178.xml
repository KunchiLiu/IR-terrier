The following measure perform : Medical history , include medication Pregnancy test female child bear capacity Height weight Assessment pubertal stage Assessment dietary intake calcium vitamin D Assessment physical activity Determination total body bone mineral content ( TBBMC ) , total body bone mineral density ( TBBBMD ) , spinal BMC BMD , bone age radiograph Fasting morning blood draw index mineral metabolism : serum calcium , phosphate , albumin , total alkaline phosphatase activity , 25 ( OH ) D , 1,25 ( OH ) 2D , iPTH , urinary calcium creatinine . Markers bone turnover : Serum N-telopeptide ( N-tx , marker resorption ) , bone specific alkaline phosphatase ( BALP ) osteocalcin ( marker formation ) These measure perform SLRHC Pediatric Body Composition Unit . A.2.a . Study design : The double-blind , randomize trial compare effect 24 month supplementation vitamin D3 calcium placebo bone mineral accrual . Sixty HIV-infected child adolescent , age 8-16 , randomize receive vitamin D3 plus calcium placebo . The primary outcome variable , BMC BMD , measure , 1 2 year randomization . Serial measurement serum 25 ( OH ) D , 1,25 ( OH ) 2D , PTH , marker bone turnover assess defined interval study . A.2.b . Treatment arm : Eligible subject assign randomization receive either : 1 . Vitamin D3 ( 100,000 IU 2.5 mg ) administer orally every 60 day elemental calcium 500 mg twice daily ; 2 . Vitamin D3 placebo administer orally every 60 day plus calcium placebo twice daily . A.2.c . Entry randomization visit : All eligible subject initial study entry evaluation perform SLRHC Pediatric Body Composition Unit virtue participation cross-sectional study ( Section D.2.f ) . As qualify serum 25 ( OH ) D level know prior cross-sectional study visit , study participant eligible randomized clinical trial randomly assign ( see Methods ) cross-sectional study visit one two treatment arm ; case , cross-sectional visit also function entry/baseline visit . Each subject give first dose vitamin D3/placebo first 30 day supply calcium/placebo dispense . female child bear capacity A.2.d . Follow-up Visits : Participants see monthly first year study every two month second year . Entry/baseline , 12-month 24-month visit take place SLRHC Body Composition Unit . All visit take place site usual care receive . Vitamin D3/placebo administer study visit every 2 month . At monthly visit first year every 2 month second year randomization , 30 60 day supply calcium/placebo dispense . Adherence calcium supplementation assess visit . A.2.e . 12 24 month study visit : These visit take place SLRHC Body Composition Unit . At visit , follow test perform : Medical history , include medication Pregnancy test female child bear capacity Height weight Assessment pubertal stage Assessment dietary intake calcium vitamin D Assessment physical activity Determination TBBMC , TBBBMD , spinal BMC BMD Bone age radiograph A.3 . METHODS A.3.a . Randomization : Randomization HIV-infected child treatment arm perform computer-generated random number ( SAS version 8.2 Windows , SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Randomization stratify sex age ( e.g. , &gt; &lt; 14 year ) order ensure treatment group balance respect variable . Block randomization use ensure number subject arm remain approximately similar time . A randomization sequence generate study biostatistician communicate research pharmacist dispense active placebo medication subject enrol . A.3.b . Adherence : Adherence calcium/placebo assess visit pill count use blister package . Adherence vitamin D/placebo ensure supervised administration define study visit . A.3.c . Measurement bone mineral status child adolescent : Bone mineral status HIV-infected subject determine whole body lumbar spine DXA scan . These perform SLRHC Pediatric Body Composition Unit use Hologic Delphi-A Scanner . Measurement bone mineral content gram DXA correlate well total body calcium ( Ellis 1996 ) . To date , laboratory provide bone mineral body composition data use DXA 13,000 subject 50 research project clinical trial . The cv bone mineral density human subject laboratory 0.8 % . The Hologic Delphi A.4.d . Assessment skeletal age : Skeletal age determine standardized bone age radiograph leave wrist perform SL site Department Radiology day DXA scan . The sex-specific standard bone age use plain film hand wrist Atlas Greulich Pyle use standard reference ( Greulich Pyle 1959 ) . A single pediatric radiologist , blind age treatment status subject , read bone age radiograph . Follow bone age radiograph perform subject find entry achieve skeletal maturity ( i.e . epiphyseal fusion ) . Maturation profound effect bone mineral accrual . Prior appearance physical sign puberty available method assess relative maturity `` biological age '' measure skeletal `` bone age '' standardize x-ray . Skeletal age continue use , even appearance physical sign puberty , rate progression bone maturation puberty varies individual . It particularly variable child chronic disease whose general health status rate growth pubertal progress may `` catch-up '' `` catch-down '' response change treatment disease activity . In child chronic disease , bone age may better indicator maturational status chronological age , size , pubertal stage . Bone age therefore important co-variate protocol . A.3.e . Assessment pubertal status : Standardized physical examination perform study investigator ( Drs . Stephen Arpadi Mary Horlick ) explanation procedure rationale subject family member determine level sexual maturation . These perform study visit SLRHC Pediatric Body Composition Unit use method Tanner ( Tanner 1970 , Tanner 1971 ) . Repeat assessment perform subject determine entry experience sexual maturation ( i.e . Tanner Stage 5 ) . Because normal wide variability time pace puberty , standardize serial assessment pubertal status study participant perform help distinguish effect puberty effect study treatment , increase age , height weight bone mineral accrual . Measurement variable potentially great importance study child chronic illness HIV-infection delay sexual maturation common ( de Martino 2001 ) . Changes bone mineral mass DXA time puberty accompany growth spurt report male female ( Glastre 1990 , Gilsanz 1991 , Rico 1993 , Mora 1999 ) . However , reference standard generate DXA manufacturer recent longitudinal study age- sex-specific ( Bachrach 1999 ) . Reference standard base age puberty helpful evaluate patient disorder , HIV infection , affect growth , time puberty , may independently affect bone mineral acquisition ( Leonard 1999 , Thearle 2000 , Arpadi 2002 ) . A.3.f . Procedure assessment pubertal status : The evaluation puberty project follow exactly protocol BMDCS project . The impact pubertal stage bone mineral accrual explain participant entry study visit , family understand purpose physical examination pubertal status . The pediatric endocrinologist ( MH ) , follow protocol establish multicenter BMDCS project , evaluate pubertal stage . For girl , breast development assess visual criterion , also palpation early stage puberty ( Marshall Tanner 1971 , Biro 1992 ) . For boy , testicular size assess use ovoid Prader orchidometer ( Zachman 1974 , Biro 1995 ) . For boys girl , pubic hair development assess criterion Tanner ( Marshall Tanner 1970 , 1971 ) . A.3.g . Procedure measure height weight : Standing height measure near 0.1cm use wall-mounted stadiometer ( Holtain , Crosswell , Wales ) . Three separate measurement obtain time point specify result average . Weight obtain subject hospital gown measure near 0.1 kg ( Weight Tronix , New York , NY ) . A.3.h . Assessment modifiable behavioral factor influence bone mineral accrual : We use food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) dietary data collection provide estimate nutritional intake study . The availability standardize information dietary intake also permit investigation relation food/nutrient intake bone accretion growth HIV-infected child . Weight-bearing physical activity determine use publish self-report tool Slemenda et al ( 1991 ) . Although several study support validity measure child 's self-reports physical activity , Slemenda 's study report use self-report childhood weight-bearing physical activity ( Sallis 1993 , Slemenda 1991 ) . A.3.i . Procedures dietary intake physical activity questionnaire : Following protocol establish multicenter BMDCS project , subject complete FFQ ( help parent guardian 14 year ) . The questionnaire take 20 minute complete time visit . A picture contain various serve size include FFQ . Subjects ask indicate picture best match serve size . Subjects remind indicate much usually eat - much serve . All participant administer questionnaire ask recall number hour past week involve several physical activity . The investigator prompt participant recall activity accurately possible . The child may ask parent help . About ten minute need complete questionnaire . The FFQ , BLOCKIDS ( NutritionQuest , University Berkeley , Berkeley , CA ) , comprise food identify NHANES III important age demographic group . Of relevance project , measurement include dietary intake Vitamin D calcium . The FFQ validate African American child age 8-10 year ( Block 2000 ) macro micronutrient ( e.g . correlation calcium = 0.64 ) . Additional validation study plan part BMDHC project . A.3..j .

A.3.l . Immunologic virologic measure HIV disease : CD-4 +lymphocyte number CD4 % value subject obtain result perform Clinical site laboratory part patient care . Quantitative viral load assay -HIV RNA determine polymerase chain reaction method perform part clinical care collaborate clinical site collect used study . A.3.m . Procedure safety monitor toxicity management : Urine pregnancy test administer female child-bearing capacity SLRHC visit immediately radiological study perform . All female child bear capacity question pregnant prior urine test DEXA scan . Monitoring hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria , hypocalemia : In order maintain blind subject treatment assignment , laboratory report review Dr. Shane , Co-investigator , locate New York-Presbyterian Hospital , physically apart clinical research facility . This also location GCRC specialize laboratory assay perform . Serum calcium albumin spot morning fast urine monitor monthly basis first year study , every 2 month second year . These assay perform Quest Diagnostics Laboratory convenience sample ( i.e. , run collect ) . Clinical laboratory abnormality consider investigator relate study drug manage follow : If hypercalcemia ( &gt; 10.5 mg/dl , albumin-corrected ) develop , dose calcium reduce 250 mg/day level rechecked one week later . If abnormality resolve , weekly stepwise reduction oral calcium follow normal level achieve supplemental calcium discontinue . Vitamin D3 placebo withhold serum calcium return normal . Subjects persistent abnormality refer treat physician . Vitamin D3 placebo withhold serum calcium return normal . If severe hypercalcemia develops ( &gt; 12.0 mg/dl ) , calcium supplement Vitamin D/placebo discontinue immediately subject withdrawn study . Hypercalceria If hypercalciuria develops ( urinary calcium /creatinine ratio &gt; 0.25 spot urine specimen ) , subject 24 hour urine collection perform confirmation . For confirmed hypercalciuria ( &gt; 4mg/kg/24 hr ) , dose calcium reduce 250mg spot urine repeat one week later . If abnormality resolve , weekly stepwise reduction calcium follow hypercalceria resolve supplemental calcium discontinue . If necessary , vitamin D3 placebo withhold urine calcium return normal . If hypocalcemia develops ( &lt; 8.4 mg/dl , correct albumin ) , blood draw Blood UreaNitrogen , serum electrolyte , creatinine , 25-OHD , PTH , Creatinine , Magnesium , Albumin . A subject confirm hypocalemia associate vitamin D deficiency ( 25-OHD &lt; 10 ng/dl PTH &gt; 73 withdrawn study refer medical provider treatment withdrawn study Monitoring vitamin D deficiency During first year study , serum measurement 25-OH iPTH drawn monthly every 2 month second study year . Each subject 's specimen freeze immediately collection , transfer SLRHC store -70 degree . At one year interval subject ' sample assayed `` batch `` fashion . On basis annual determination , subject persistent vitamin D deficiency ( 25-OHD &lt; 10ng/l PTH &gt; 73 ) last throughout winter summer month , withdrawn study refer medical provider . We anticipate low incidence particular abnormality . In prior study dose vitamin D3 ( 100,000 IU ) administer every 60 day 6 month , Guillemant et al . report instance hypercalcemia French adolescent male , age 13-16 , seasonal vitamin D deficiency ( Guillemant 2000 ) . In addition , on-going study conduct Dr. Shane ( Prevention Osteoporosis After Cardiac Transplantation , ROI AR 46124-04 ) , among 74 subject receive metabolically active form Vitamin D , calcitriol ( 0.25 ug BID ) , 4 episode urinary calcium excretion &gt; 400 mg/g creatinine . Besides calcitriol , subject receive corticosteroid , also increase urinary calcium excretion . Corticosteroids permit co-administered medication present study . We anticipate Vitamin D3 adverse effect HIV infection antiretroviral medication . However , HIV-infected subject experience otherwise unexplained decline immune status , base CD4 count CD4 % , increase measure HIV viral load believe treat physician possibly relate study medication withdraw study participation . Measurements CD4 count , CD % , HIV viral load measure clinical care sit per standard care . Results monitor treat physician . Subjects decline TBBMC z-score &gt; 0.5 baseline one year on-treatment DXA discontinue study refer additional clinical evaluation treat physician . In addition , low impact repeat fracture occur , clinical evaluation treat physician , safety officer Study PI determine subject remain study.Monitoring DXA scan result study subject perform Dr. Horlick , Co-Investigator Director Pediatric Body Composition Laboratory St. Luke's-Roosevelt . Finally , placebo-controlled trial involve child , elect include interim data analysis perform 12 month on-treatment data ( Human Subjects , Section E. ) . A Data Safety Monitoring Board comprise expert biostatistics , pediatric HIV disease , pediatric endocrinology , pediatric bone acquisition establish per NIH guideline monitor study result safety efficacy , establish criterion early termination study consultation Principal Co-Investigators , determine criterion fulfil . A.3.n Data analysis power calculation Specific Aim 1 : To determine effect calcium vitamin D3 supplementation bone mineral accrual HIV-infected child adolescent receive HAART . The primary hypothesis study BMC BMD increase HIV-infected subject randomize receive vitamin D3 plus calcium compare subject receive placebo . We test hypothesis comparing TBBMC , TBBMD , SBMC , SBMD measure total body spine DXA scan perform baseline 1 2 year post-randomization 2 study arm use intention-to-treat analysis . A repeated measure analysis covariance use analyze bone accrual data . Differences bone mineral content treatment placebo group compare 1 2 year control possible difference group entry trial . The between-group main effect ( vitamin D3 calcium versus placebo ) test whether overall difference group , within-group x time interaction effect test whether difference group constant two follow-up year . The magnitude change vitamin D3 calcium group also compare normative data BMDCS determine many child group achieve level within normal limit ( 95 % CI ) use algorithm present preliminary study section C.5 . Based prior pilot data , mean yearly change TBBMC 30 HIV-infected child age 7-14 year 120 g standard deviation 84 . A difference SD boys girl note . In order maintain conservative estimate choose SD observe girl . This assume level yearly change observed placebo group . Based data Pediatric Rosetta Project ( NIDDK 37352 ) , cross-sectional study &gt; 1300 child , mean yearly change TBBMC healthy African-American Hispanic child age 7-14 year 195 g. The effect size ( ) compare mean yearly change 120 g placebo group versus change 195 g Vitamin D3 calcium group therefore 0.89 . Twenty-one child group sufficient detect effect size magnitude alpha = 0.05 beta = 80 % . If sample size increase 30 child group , power sufficient detect difference 61 gm vitamin D3 calcium group placebo group alpha = 0.05 power = 80 % . This comparable difference observe clinical trial healthy adolescent girl ( mean age , 11.9 year ) receive either calcium ( 110 % RDA ) placebo ( Lloyd 1996 ) . Differences rate sexual maturation study treatment group may `` unbalance '' group respect factor significance bone mass outcomes . To address included standardized measurement pubertal stage use covariate analysis . Specific Aim # 2 : Determine effect HIV infection vitamin D calcium supplementation indices mineral metabolism marker bone turnover . We hypothesize index mineral metabolism abnormal ( low serum 25 ( OH ) D elevate PTH ) biochemical marker bone formation resorption increase HIV-infected child HAART compare normal control index mineral metabolism marker bone formation resorption return toward normal HIV-infected child adolescent randomize receive vitamin D calcium supplementation . We test hypothesis first compare marker bone turnover ( osteocalcin , BALP N-Tx ) HIV-infected healthy child adolescent enrol cross-sectional study use independent sample t-test compare mean . Longitudinal change bone turnover marker HIV-infected child adolescent receive vitamin D calcium supplement also compare receive placebo . Levels vitamin D metabolites marker bone turnover ( ( osteocalcin , BALP N-Tx ) take interval analyze use mixed model regression model trend measure time evaluate dependent inter-relationships variable . Specific Aim # 3 : Evaluate vitamin D store HIV-infected child adolescent receive HAART . We hypothesize vitamin D store decrease child HIV infection compare healthy control . We test compare serum level vitamin D metabolite indices mineral metabolism ( 25 ( OH ) D 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ) PTH ) HIV-infected child adolescent receive HAART compare healthy control . Data testing obtain cross-sectional study . The HIV-infected group consist sample HIV+ child screen recruitment study healthy group consist similar age child recruit neighborhood ( include healthy sibling HIV positive child ) . Screening level serum vitamin D metabolites PTH HIV-positive child compare level healthy child use independent sample t-test . The main variable interest 25 ( OH ) D best reflect vitamin D store . Based prior pilot data , mean ( SD ) expect 25 ( OH ) among HIV-infected subject 21 ( 11 ) ng/ml . The sample size present study 80 % power detect change 25 ( OH ) D 8 ng/ml alpha=0.05 . Analysis covariance base general linear regression model use determine whether possible group difference remain controlling factor race , sex , estimate dietary intake Vitamin D sunlight exposure ( use month study surrogate sunlight exposure ) . Specific Aim # 4 : Evaluate vitamin D store determinant bone mass HIV- infect child adolescent receive HAART . Our hypothesis among HIV-infected child adolescent receive HAART , vitamin D store , measure serum 25 ( OH ) D , significant determinant bone mass . We assess relationship variable TBBMC HIV-infected child adolescent . This conducted analysis data obtain sample least 60 HIV-infected child adolescent screen enrollment longitudinal clinical trial . Within HIV positive group , linear regression use determine whether HIV-related factor include antiviral medication , marker immunodeficiency ( CD4count ) , HIV viral load , level cytokine play role predict serum vitamin D level bone mass . Additional co-variates include model include age , sex , race , height , weight pubertal stage . These analysis especially critical measurement inclusion clinical trial analysis allow development potential mechanistic pathway etiology abnormal bone mass intermediate response variable involve amelioration . Using multiple regression model assess relationship TNF , IL-6 vitamin D level TBBMC . It estimate 50 % HIV positive child screen meet inclusion criterion trial approximately 100 120 HIV positive child available cross sectional comparison equal number healthy child also recruit . With total 200 child , sample size large enough add 18 covariates addition group factor ( HIV-positive versus healthy ) test 5 % increase R2 , alpha = 0.05 power = 80 % . A sample 100 HIV-positive child alone allow regression analysis include 9 predictor collectively explain least 15 % variance outcome variable ( TBBMC , etc . ) alpha = 0.05 power = 80 % .</detailed_description>
