	<criteria>Patients age 18 diagnose brain tumor central nervous system treatment plan discuss . Must willing/able undergo 3 5 additional contrast enhance research MRI scan . You take part study NOT afraid small , enclosed place . A patient claustrophobic . Females pregnant lactating . Patients electrically , magnetically mechanically activated implant heart pacemaker , magnetic surgical clip , prosthesis implant neurological stimulator . Any patient history allergic reaction MR contrast agent ( Omniscan , Magnevist , MultiHance ) Patients require general anesthesia complete MRI exam patient negative reaction MRI sedation . ( Chloral Hydrate , Pentobarbital Versed ) You NOT metal , implanted device body , example , aneurysm clip , pacemaker , artificial joint limb . It extremely important tell u surgery might chance metal would inside . Also , job experience might leave metal fragment body , please let u know , MRI 's strong magnetic field could disturb metal fragment body interfere implanted device , pacemaker , cause harm .</criteria>
