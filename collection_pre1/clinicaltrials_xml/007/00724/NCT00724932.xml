	<brief_summary>The current trial design demonstrate faster recovery neuromuscular blockade ( NMB ) induce rocuronium reversal 1-2 Post Tetanic Count ( PTC ) 4.0 mg.kg-1 sugammadex compare 50 Âµg.kg-1 neostigmine reappearance second twitch ( T2 ) participant undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy appendectomy propofol anesthesia , compare safety evaluate operating room Post Anesthetic Care Unit ( PACU ) length stay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Sugammadex With Neostigmine During Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Appendectomy ( P05699 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In surgical procedure neuromuscular block desire intubation and/or avoid unwanted muscular activity , anesthesiologist may use profound NMB end surgery , e.g . open abdominal procedure laparoscopic procedure order improve surgical condition . Reversal sugammadex dose 4.0 mg.kg-1 1-2 PTC intubation dose 0.6 mg.kg-1 maintenance dose rocuronium find safe efficacious previous clinical trial never investigate exclusively participant undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy appendectomy . With sugammadex profound muscle relaxation may provide right end surgical procedure . This may lead improved Patient Outcomes , improvement time end surgery discharge PACU . In multi-center , randomize , parallel-group , active-controlled , safety-assessor blind trial benefit investigate .</detailed_description>
