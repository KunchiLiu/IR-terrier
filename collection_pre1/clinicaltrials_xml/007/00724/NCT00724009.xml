	<detailed_description>Screening do prior enrollment study . The follow do part screen process : - Medical history review - Physical exam - Measurement vital Signs - Blood test ( approximately 6 teaspoon blood ) do see liver kidney healthy , HIV ( virus cause AIDS ) test study pregnancy test . - Urine test - Bone marrow biopsy aspirate If patient ineligible donor Allogeneic Stem Cell transplantation , able participate clinical trial . After result test obtain , doctor decide whether participate study . Study procedure : The study drug give 5 day . Days 1 5 : The patient receive dexamethasone 1.5 hour prior administration Clofarabine part standard care subject receive Clofarabine . The patient receive intravenous ( IV ) injection ( vein ) Clofarabine day 5 day . This injection give hospital give approximately 60 minute day . The actual dose Clofarabine base weight height subject . The patient follow test do see effect study drug : Each day Clofarabine administration , day 12 day stem cell transplantation : - Physical exam - Vital sign - Blood test . About 3-4 teaspoon take time . Day 12 Clofarabine administration outline stem cell transplantation : â€¢ Bone marrow biopsy aspirate . After Clofarabine administration , short rest period 7-14 day . After rest period , patient start receive condition chemotherapy regimen ( standard care drug well prepare body stem cell transplant ) . This regimen begin 15-21 day first receive Clofarabine , consist additional treatment ( chemotherapy and/or radiation ) . The type treatment ( ) patient receive conditioning dependent type disease . In addition , treatment decide doctor independent research . The duration conditioning period variable may take 5-8 day . Stem cell usually give one day completion regimen , 21 30 day patient first receive Clofarabine . Follow-up Subjects response proceed stem cell transplant follow weekly first three month every month six month , every two month 12 month , every three month 18 month . The stem cell transplant do 21-30 day first receive Clofarabine . Subjects go stem cell transplant follow 3 month follow administration Clofarabine . At visit , follow do : - A physical exam - Medical history - Blood test ( 3 teaspoon blood take ) perform . End study At time , follow test do : - Physical exam - Blood test - Bone marrow biopsy</detailed_description>
