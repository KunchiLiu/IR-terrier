	<brief_title>A Trial ALB 109564 ( ) Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first clinical study ALB 109564 ( ) , tubulin inhibitor , interfere tubulin polymerization , primarily target microtubule compose mitotic spindle , result metaphase arrest . The motivation development ALB 109564 ( ) create molecule provide great anti-tumor activity license vinca alkaloid , without increase level toxicity often associated therapy . The objective propose study : ( 1 ) determine safety tolerability , include maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , ALB 109564 ( ) administer intravenously every 3 week subject advance , treatment-refractory solid tumor ; ( 2 ) evaluate pharmacokinetics ALB 109564 ( ) ; ( 3 ) document observe anti-tumor activity . The start dose 1.2 mg/m2 every 3 week expect ensure safe first-in-human dose allow increase 50 % first several subject cohort . The first cohort enroll 3 subject , subsequent 3-subject cohort proceed accord modify Fibonacci scheme . The standard dose increase , absence dose limit toxicity , 50 % . However , 1 subject experience DLT , 2 subject within cohort experience ≥ Grade 2 drug-related adverse event , subsequent dose escalation occur approximately 25 % increment . In case dose escalation increment decrease 25 % follow 2 subject ≥ Grade 2 drug-related event , increment subsequently reset 50 % , 2 successive cohort , DLTs observe , 1 subject per cohort experience ≥ Grade 2 drug-related AE . DLT MTD determination make accord first treatment cycle ( single dose plus 3-week follow-up ) . The MTD declare high level none original 3 subject 1 expand 6-subject cohort experience DLT . At MTD level , subject enrol two parallel group : Group A , solid tumor unrestricted tumor type , Group B , primary tumor type soft tissue sarcoma . Up total 24 subject enrol MTD . Subjects tolerate treatment eligible continue receive treatment maximum 12 cycle 3-week schedule per Investigator 's medical judgment . Subjects whose disease progress 12 cycle treatment ALB 109564 ( ) may continue receive treatment 3-week cycle , protocol assessment , contingent upon Investigator 's judgment Sponsor 's approval . The actual enrollment subject determine safety experience number dose-escalation cohort require achieve MTD . The projected enrollment approximately 60 subject total study duration approximately 2 year .</detailed_description>
