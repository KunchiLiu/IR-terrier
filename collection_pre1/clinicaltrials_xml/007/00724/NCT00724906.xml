	<brief_summary>This two separate identical study : ALSE-A-02a , ALSE-A02b . Each study design evaluate diagnostic accuracy safety single dose 123I-ALTROPANE® subject upper extremity tremor less three year . Currently , radiopharmaceutical diagnostic imaging agent approve FDA U.S. use diagnose Parkinson disease relate Parkinsonian syndrome . The diagnosis Parkinsonian syndromes U.S. base clinical criterion . The goal demonstrate 123I-ALTROPANE® paired SPECT image permit accurate early diagnosis Parkinson disease clinical diagnosis general neurologist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two Separate But Identical Studies Evaluating Safety Efficacy ALTROPANE® Use SPECT Imaging Upper Extremity Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each study prospective , multi-center , non-randomized , open-label , patient clinical trial include 240 subject per study . Subjects male female , age 40-80 year , approximately 20 site per study . Subjects participate 5 study visit course study period . The screening visit include assessment eligibility . The second visit collection community neurologist 's diagnostic assessment . The third visit , subject receive single intravenous ( IV ) injection 123I-ALTROPANE® single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) imaging , include appropriate safety assessment dose . The fourth visit , occur 24 72 hour SPECT imaging , include follow safety assessment well first Movement Disorder Specialist 's ( MDS ) evaluation . The fifth visit , occur 6 month ( ±7 day ) SPECT imaging , include follow-up safety assessment well MDS reevaluation truth standard diagnosis .
