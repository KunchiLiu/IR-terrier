	<brief_title>Presurgical Planning With Functional MRI ( fMRI ) Mapping Motor Cortex Patients With Cerebral Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine fMRI precise enough use preoperative decision making patient brain tumor . Before patient brain surgery tumor remove , functional mapping brain take place either intra-operatively post operatively subdural grid implant place . Mapping help surgeon determine area brain responsible different important body function . During mapping procedure surgeon determine safely remove part brain tumor . The investigator hop show fMRI accurate mapping different area brain , without utilize invasive form brain mapping .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patient brain tumor healthy volunteer If patient pregnant . If patient suffer significant degree claustrophobia . If patient claustrophobic require general anesthesia complete diagnostic MRI . Contraindications MRI due surgery and/or implantation pacemaker pacemaker wire , open heart surgery placement artificial heart valve , brain aneurysm surgery , middle ear implant , hear aid , brace extensive dental work , cataract surgery lens implant , implanted mechanical electrical device , implanted neurological stimulators artificial limbs joint . Contraindications MRI due foreign metallic object body : bullet , BBs , pellet , surgical magnetic metal clip , joint bone pin , metal plate , shrapnel one history work near metal could metal shaving eye .</criteria>
