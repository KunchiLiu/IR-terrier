	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate outcome specific repetitive biomechanical perturbation training motor pattern . The first hypothesis project footwear derive biomechanical challenge convey active passive match biomechanical response ( i.e . kinetic , kinematic electromyographic ) trough musculoskeletal kinematic chain . The second hypothesis project repetitive exposure in-situ ( trough gait sickle ) introduction biomechanical stimulus would generate process motor learn thus convey plasticity exist locomotor pattern gait strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Training With Custom-Made Biomechanical Perturbation Platform Kinetics , Kinematics Electromyography Knee Osteoarthritis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : Prospective , case control Setting : subject undergo tailored training program utilizing novel biomechanical system comprise four modular element attach onto foot-worn platform ( APOS system , Apos - Sports Medical Technologies Ltd. Hertzlia , Israel ) conveys perturbation throughout gait sickle . Pre post training level walk examine via : ( 1 ) three-dimensional motion analysis system ( 2 ) ground reaction force analysis use force platform ( 3 ) Electro-Myography system . Each subject examine 4 different setting Patients participate continued biomechanical perturbation train 3-6 month undergo second gait examination Ages Eligible Study : 50 Years - 75 Years , Genders Eligible Study : None Accepts patient suffer medial compartment knee osteoarthritis</detailed_description>
