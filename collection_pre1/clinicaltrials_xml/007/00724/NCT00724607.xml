	<brief_summary>Active duty military personnel serve current recent conflict Afghanistan Iraq frequently expose blast mechanisms traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .1,2 Although physical trauma unexpected war fighting , survival blast-related head injury become common occurrence recent year . As , associate cerebral damage less well study understood . The Brain Injury Outcomes ( BIO ) Study longitudinal study short-term objective good characterize multi-modal outcome individual sustain brain injury use system medicine approach . Long-term aim include monitor participant sign emerge symptom age-related vulnerability . Identification abnormality profile severity level brain injury ( source ) reflect second long-range goal . Third , investigator examine compare physiology Veterans sustain Mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( mTBI ) without persist symptom various co-morbidities include posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . A control group Veterans sustain TBI also recruit comparison . Fourth , investigator intend facilitate clinical use advance methodology , brain imaging tissue measure , brain injured ( population ) . Finally , investigator assess method analysis , combination integration multi-modal data search diagnostic profile . Increased knowledge injury pattern trajectory associate brain injury could contribute good method diagnosis , monitoring , perhaps , treatment . This investigation spawn several sub-studies , one Validation Brief Objective Neurobehavioral Detectors ( BOND ) Mild TBI , continue . The investigator collaborate Harvard/Boston Children 's Hospital Angiogenic Signaling Signatures Identified Stress Trauma ( ASSIST ) sub-study . Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) integrate BIO Study multi-modal data .</brief_summary>
