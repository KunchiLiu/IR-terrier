	<brief_summary>Many old subject experience difficulty understand speech noisy environment . Part problem relate change occur ear age compromise hear high-pitched sound . Another part problem speech understand relates change age neural circuit brain process different speech sound . Evidence suggest change neural circuit particularly large hear loss present . Thus , hear aid may help compensate hear deficit amplify speech sound , additional treatment necessary restore optimal neural connection brain speech sound accurately distinguish . We develop PC-based training program attempt restore optimal neural connection . The current randomized trial evaluate whether two month train improve ability discriminate different consonant sound noise also improve understand continuous speech enhance auditory memory high-level auditory function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More 300,000 veteran sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL ) fit VA-issued hearing aid ( HAs ) year primary goal improve understanding speech . Even old veteran without hear loss experience gradual decline speech discrimination due age-related change auditory function compromise speech understand everyday environment . Neuroplastic reorganization within central auditory system due SNHL age contribute effect compromise subject ' ability process phonetic cue essential understanding speech noise . As consequence , even HA restore high frequency signal cochlea patient SNHL , speech understand remain suboptimal absence rehabilitative perceptual learning . We develop perceptual learning paradigm drive rehabilitative reorganization significantly improve speech discrimination new HA user . We propose test improved training paradigms new experience HA user older subject normal hearing . In Exp . 1 evaluate baseline speech discrimination population use speech-reception threshold ( SRTs ) sentence , consonant-vowel-consonant nonsense syllable test ( CVC-NST ) , test tone-pattern discrimination , test auditory short-term verbal memory ( ASTVM ) . An analysis correlation measure provide information basic process underlying impaired word sentence identification . In Exp . 2 investigate effect CVC-identification training use performance-adapted masking noise . Based previous result , anticipate training significantly improve CVC-NST score . We examine extent training improve SRTs , tone-pattern processing , ASTVM . In Exp . 3 train subject tone-pattern identification task evaluate extent non-phonetic factor ( e.g. , familiarity computerize hearing test , placebo effect training , improvement auditory attention , etc . ) may contribute training benefit . In Exp . 4 compare benefit train single-consonant syllable benefit two-consonant syllable training study Exp . 2 . Finally , Exp . 5 study benefit CVC train use consonant-specific noise level adjust compensate intrinsic difference discriminability different consonant compare benefit global adaptive training Exp . 2 . The experiment clarify fundamental mechanism underlie deficit speech discrimination ASTVM , provide insight nature training-related improvement , elucidate parameter need optimize hearing rehabilitation . Relevance VA patient care mission : HAs relatively ineffective improve ability hearing-impaired subject understand speech many everyday listen situation . These experiment clarify extent perceptual training improve speech discrimination enhance ASTVM condition new experienced HA user older subject normal hearing . Perceptual training could potentially benefit million veteran wear HAs well old veteran normal hear experience difficulty understand remember speech .</detailed_description>
