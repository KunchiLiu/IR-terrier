	<brief_title>Unilateral Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Nucleus ( Nucl . ) Accumbens ( Acc . ) Patients With Treatment Resistant Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From late ninety ` , work group publish case series patient treatment resistant OCD undergo deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) . This stereotactical method involve surgically implant electrodes previously use primarily treatment Parkinson ` disease tremor . In almost report case , bilateral stimulation anterior limb internal capsule ( ALIC apply . However , electrode design group vary case stimulation area extend adjacent ventral striatal region include nucleus accumbens ( NAC ) . Cortical-striate-thalami-cortical ( CSTC ) circuit support implicated pathogenesis underlie OCD cause failure inhibition ventral striatum . Together structure nucleus accumbens form ventral striatum . Because predominant role NAC exert modulatory effect within circuit consider provide promise target location DBS . Moreover NAC ventrally border anterior limb internal capsule subventricular lateral fundus nucleus accumbens even permeate rostral section numerous internal capsule fiber bundle . It therefore expect electrode trajectory stimulation target select u additionally would effect fibre system internal capsule . The NAC introduce primary target DBS treatment resistant OCD group . Pilot series show right stimulation NAC yield best result , whereas bilateral stimulation show additional benefit .</detailed_description>
