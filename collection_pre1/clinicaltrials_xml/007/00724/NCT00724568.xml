	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate investigational combination four drug call Revlimid® ( lenalidomide ) , Velcade® ( bortezomib ) , Dexamethasone Doxil® ( RVDD ) possible treatment newly diagnose multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Study Revlimid® , Velcade® Dexamethasone Doxil® ( RVDD ) Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During Phase I portion clinical trial , dose Revlimid® Doxil® increase best safest amount ( dose ) identify combination Velcade® Dexamethasone . `` Investigational '' mean drug combination still study research doctor try find safe dose use , side effect may cause effective Velcade® , Doxil® , Dexamethasone Revlimid® investigational combination treat newly diagnose multiple myeloma . In clinical trial look high dose combination give safely see well work combination newly diagnose patient . Each drug , Velcade® , Doxil® , Dexamethasone Revlimid® approve FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) . They approve combination use type cancer type cancer . Velcade® currently approve United States Food Drug Administration ( US FDA ) treatment multiple myeloma patient receive least one prior therapy . Doxil® recently approve US FDA multiple myeloma combination Velcade® patient previously receive Velcade® receive least one prior therapy . Dexamethasone commonly use , either alone , combination drug , treat multiple myeloma . Revlimid® currently approve US FDA combination dexamethasone treatment patient multiple myeloma receive least 1 prior therapy . After Phase I clinical trial defines safest dos Velcade® , Doxil® , Dexamethasone Revlimid® take together , research study move second portion , Phase II clinical trial . The Phase II portion clinical trial test clinical effectiveness best dose combination four drug .</detailed_description>
