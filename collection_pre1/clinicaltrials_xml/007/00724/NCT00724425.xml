	<brief_summary>IPI-493 potent inhibitor heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) orally bioavailable via novel formulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study IPI-493</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hsp90 control proper folding , function , stability various `` client '' protein within cell . Many client Hsp90 ( Akt , Bcr-Abl , EGFR , Flt-3 , c-Kit PDGFR α ) oncoproteins important cell-signaling protein , therefore critical tumor cell growth survival . Inhibition Hsp90 result degradation proteins , abrogate growth survival signal lead tumor cell death .</detailed_description>
