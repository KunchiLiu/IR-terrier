	<brief_summary>The finding study advance movement reorganization mechanism underlie treatment approach clinical intervention technique . These finding may inform rehabilitation professional treatment approach superior another one certain aspect outcome benefit certain treatment approach . Accordingly , result project may help u move quickly design develop efficient effective rehabilitation program individualize patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The first purpose investigate relative effect modify constraint-induced therapy ( mCIT ) vs. bilateral isokinematic training ( BIT ) vs. traditional therapist-based training ( TR ) movement reorganization , motor performance , functional ability , quality life ( QoL ) immediately six month later treatment deliver hospital . Movement reorganization evaluate kinematic instrument . Motor performance , functional ability , QoL assess use clinical assessment tool . By token , also investigate relative effect two approach deliver home . The second purpose study whether home-based mCIT efficacious various aspect outcomes describe immediately six month later follow treatment , compare home-based TR , hospital-based mCIT TR.We also study question regard home-based BIT efficacy . The third purpose establish predictive model predict functional QoL outcome immediately six month later follow mCIT BIT .</detailed_description>
