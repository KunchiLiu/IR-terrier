	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study mitotane IMC-A12 see well work compare mitotane alone treat patient recurrent , metastatic , primary adrenocortical cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , mitotane , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , IMC-A12 , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether mitotane effective without monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 treat adrenocortical cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IMC-A12 With Mitotane v Mitotane Alone Recurrent , Metastatic , Primary ACC That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate patient recurrent , metastatic , primary unresectable adrenocortical carcinoma treat mitotane v without anti-IGF-1R recombinant monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 ( IMC-A12 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare response rate patient use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumor ( RECIST ) criterion . II . Compare change tumor size baseline 12 week patient . III . Compare overall trajectory tumor growth patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Define predictive marker response insensitivity IMC-A12 . II . Define pharmacodynamic marker IMC-A12 . III . Determine whether tumor expression IGF-IR activation downstream signal archival tumor tissue sample predict efficacy IMC-A12 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study include single-arm safety evaluation phase follow randomized phase . Initially , patient enrol safety evaluation phase . If ≤ 6 20 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity , study may proceed randomized phase . SAFETY EVALUATION PHASE : Patients receive oral mitotane twice daily anti-IGF-1R recombinant monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 IV 1 hour every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . RANDOMIZED PHASE : Patients stratify accord participate center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral mitotane twice daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients document disease progression may cross receive treatment arm II . ARM II : Patients receive mitotane arm I anti-IGF-1R recombinant monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 IV 1 hour every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Archival frozen tissue block , unstained tumor tissue slide archival paraffin block , plasma sample , urine sample may collect stored future correlative biomarker study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 6 month . NOTE : The study terminate safety evaluation phase ( i.e. , randomization phase ) due futility concern . Thus , patient enrol ARM II ( i.e. , mitotate + IMC-A12 ) . Results present report give safety evaluation phase .</detailed_description>
