	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose cixutumumab see well erlotinib hydrochloride work give together without cixutumumab treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , cixutumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether erlotinib hydrochloride effective give together without cixutumumab treat non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride With Without Cixutumumab Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tolerable dose IMC-A12 ( cixutumumab ) combination erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) target NSCLC population administer randomized phase II study section . II . To determine difference PFS anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 combination erlotinib compare erlotinib alone target NSCLC population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety , tolerability , adverse event profile IMC-A12 combination erlotinib patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . II . To describe preliminary evidence clinical activity combination IMC-A12 erlotinib . III . To determine difference overall response rate ( ORR ) two treatment arm . IV . To determine response duration patient achieve objective response either study arm . V. To describe response rate , time disease progression , response duration population cross combination arm disease progression single agent erlotinib therapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore prognostic/predictive significance immunohistochemical , mutational , cytogenetic profile archive tumor tissue key element EGFR , IGF-1R relevant signal pathway relationship clinical benefit treat individual Part A Part B section study . II . To explore prognostic/predictive significance serum circulate marker ( ligands bind protein ) serum proteomic profile pre-treatment progression Part A Part B section study . III . To explore impact SNPs germline tumor derive DNA toxicity anti-cancer activity within Part A Part B section study . IV . To explore impact SNPs germline DNA erlotinib pharmacokinetics within Part A Part B section study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study include single-arm safety evaluation phase I follow randomized phase II study . Initially , patient enrol safety evaluation phase . If ≤ 2 10 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity , study may proceed randomized phase . Safety evaluation phase I : Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Randomized phase II : Patients stratify accord performance status , history smoking ( never vs ex v current ) , stage disease ( IIIA vs IIIB without malignant effusion v IIIB malignant effusion v IV ) , EGFR mutation ( present v absent v know ) , disease histology ( squamous v non-squamous ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM 1 : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily day 1-21 . Patients documented disease progression may cross receive treatment arm II . ARM II : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO arm I cixutumumab IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients receive treatment arm safety evaluation portion . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Archived tissue blood sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic analysis erlotinib hydrochloride ; pharmacogenomic analysis EGRF , IGF1R , CYP3A4/5 mutation ; IHC FISH analysis IGF1R , EGFR , cMET , ra , Akt1 , EMT ; proteomic analysis serum ligand/binding protein ( i.e. , IGF1 , IGF2 , IGFBPs , EGF , HRG , TGF-α ) use matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF ) ; mutational status analysis EGFR relate pathway protein ; RT-PCR analysis . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
