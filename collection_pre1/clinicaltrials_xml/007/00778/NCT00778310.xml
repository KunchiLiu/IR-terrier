	<brief_summary>A number brain region alter structure function patient ADHD , include prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate , caudate cerebellum . Patients ADHD often show reduced level activity frontal cingulate region brain performing measure inhibitory control functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . While stimulant medication robustly improve clinical symptom ADHD , small number study examine effect commonly prescribe medication brain activity . We propose obtain fMRI patient ADHD placebo individualize dose OROS methylphenidate ( Concerta ) . Our hypothesis Concerta increase activity brain frontal , cingulate amygdala brain brain change associate clinical improvement symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Three age group subject study : school age child ( age 9-12 ) , old adolescent ( age 15-17 year ) young adult ( age 20-25 year ) . Twenty subject study group . All subject must meet criterion ADHD , combine type either treatment naïve currently take respond well Concerta . Child adolescent patient take Concerta current level ADHD symptom assess Dupaul ADHD rating scale ( 11 ) ; adult take Concerta assess Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale ( CAARS ) . Patients whose symptom remission evidence score normal range scale may proceed directly neuroimaging portion study . Subjects treatment naïve treat remission shall three week open label trial Concerta determine optimal dose treatment symptom . Subjects two fMRI session different day . During fMRI session , perform Stop Signal Task Emotional Conflict Resolution Task . On morning scan , placebo Concerta administer double-blind , crossover design , order medication placebo randomize . The scan session take place 3 7 hour medication administration . After scan , subject research assistant go quiet room imaging center ; subject give arithmetic level set level difficulty subject master . The subject give 15 minute complete many problem possible .</detailed_description>
