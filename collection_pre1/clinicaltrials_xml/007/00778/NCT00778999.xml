	<brief_summary>The success assist reproductive technology ( ART ) critically dependent optimize protocol control ovarian stimulation provide adequate number good quality oocytes embryos . This optimization mainly valuable group infertility patient ( 9 % -24 % ) respond poorly Controlled Ovarian Stimulation ( COS ) . It also important additional 2.6 % infertility patient manifest high response gonadotropin risk hyperstimulation syndrome , life-threatening situation . Extensive research carry led introduction GnRH antagonist , alternative Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) agonist , prevention premature Luteinizing Hormone ( LH ) surge . Further research optimize GnRH antagonist regimen conclude daily treatment 200 IU recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone ( recFSH ) GnRH antagonist regimen safe , well tolerated result good clinical outcome . This protocol frequently apply US Europe . Predicting woman 's response ( base assessment ovarian reserve ) COS useful determine individualized clinical management strategy low high responder thus avoid cancellation . Such prediction base reliable scientific evidence valuable consulting patient chance success . A large number study perform , use certain clinical , ultrasonographic hormonal marker ( call predictive factor ) , try optimize COS protocol patient down-regulated long GnRH agonist protocol . Prospective trial predictive model also use adjust start dose FSH prevent low high ovarian response . To date , however , none perform woman undergo ovarian stimulation GnRH antagonist protocol . The primary objective randomize , open-label , multicenter clinical trial identify one factor capable predict ovarian response woman treat daily dose 200 IU recFSH GnRH antagonist protocol . Since many ART center use oral contraceptive mean schedule patient stimulate recFSH GnRH antagonist assist reproduction , trial evaluate also whether intervention oral contraceptive affect accuracy predictive model ovarian response .</brief_summary>
