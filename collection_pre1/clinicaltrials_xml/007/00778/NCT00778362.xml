	<brief_summary>The spleen may remove due benign hematologic disorder , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura hereditary spherocytosis , malignancy , lymphoma leukemia . Splenectomy may also perform due splenic trauma association surgical procedure , combine splenectomy make operation easier . The well know procedure distal pancreatectomy combine splenectomy . In research , two main goal . Firstly , establish data incidence overwhelm postsplenectomy infection ( OPSI ) country . Currently , western data incidence , morbidity rate mortality rate OPSI well establish vaccination along prophylactic antibiotic strongly recommend . Since incidence OPSI country n't clear , ( &gt; 95 % ) splenectomized patient hospital ( National Taiwan University Hospital ) vaccination prophylactic antibiotic . We 'll try determine incidence OPSI review hospital chart structure interview patient . The spleen phagocytic filter . So asplenic patient higher risk get infection spleen-preserving procedure propose . In initial experience , distal pancreatectomy splenic artery vein divide could safely perform greatly increased possibility preservation spleen . However , spleen preserve divide splenic artery vein , blood supply spleen shift splenic artery short gastric artery . Although substantial immunologic advantage exist splenic tissue remain , may offer sufficient protection encapsulate bacteria splenic arterial blood flow reduce experimental animal study demonstrate intact splenic arterial system necessary optimal control infection . Thus , although spleen preserve mentioned procedure , function preserve spleen questionable never study . Our second object determine splenic function spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy excision splenic artery vein comparison abdominal compute tomography immunological function patient operation . Besides , 'll design animal experiment examine rate pneumococcal clearance spleen determine relationship splenic blood flow splenic tissue mass bacterial clearance blood splenic vessel divide .</brief_summary>
