	<detailed_description>This protocol study patient elbow amputation select undergo limb allotransplantation . We study patient train use prosthetic limb device prior transplantation . We treat immunosuppression know prevent rejection allografted tissue design minimize dependence chronic maintenance immunosuppression . These patient study determine whether transplanted limb function well , worse prosthetic hand , quantify difference</detailed_description>
