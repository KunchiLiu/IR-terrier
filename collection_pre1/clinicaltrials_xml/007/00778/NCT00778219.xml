	<brief_title>Comparison Heart Rate Variability Among Tracheal Intubation Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tracheal intubation common practice general anesthesia . Laryngoscope lightwand two commonly use method tracheal intubation . The autonomic stimulation tracheal intubation may adverse effect patient investigate since many year ago . Conventional method assess autonomic activity include measurement blood catecholamine level measure change hemodynamic variable heart rate blood pressure . The former invasive noncontinuous , latter nonspecific accurate . Heart rate variability , parameter derive spectral power RR interval sequence ECG , non-invasive direct measurement autonomic activity . It ideal use current research compare autonomic activation tracheal intubation two different method . Totally 60 ASA class I-II patient age 18-65 year recruit . 40 schedule various kind surgery need general anesthesia tracheal intubation single lumen tube . These 40 patient randomly assign group A B , 20 patient . In group A tracheal intubation perform laryngoscope , group B intubation perform lightwand . The 20 patient study , group C , schedule operation need intubation double lumen endobronchial cath . The intubation perform laryngoscope . ECG wil record least 5 minute induction general anesthesia continue least 10 minute tracheal intubation . The induction maintenance anesthesia perform routine practice . The ECG record wil analyzed offline . Power spectrum wil generate time-frequency analysis heart rate variability parameter three period ( 1 ) preoperation baseline ( 2 ) pre-intubation ( 3 ) immediately post-intubation calculated compare among three group .</detailed_description>
