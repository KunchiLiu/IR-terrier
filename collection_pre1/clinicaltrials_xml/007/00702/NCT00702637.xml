	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Modafinil effective : ( 1 ) reduce fatigue excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) individual Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) ; ( 2 ) improve cognitive function quality life individual TBI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Modafinil Treat Fatigue Persons With Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : An estimate 5.3 million Americans live TBI-related disability today . These person may face many issue , however , two chronic problem seem common strikingly large number survive TBI : fatigue EDS . Need Research : Modafinil show useful fatigue sleepiness patient depression , multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease individual EDS secondary variety sleep disturbance . However , control evaluation Modafinil use treatment individual TBI date . Current Future Research Activity : Approximately 60 participant post-TBI fatigue randomly assign two 10-week period take either Modafinil placebo . Participants take Modafinil first 10 week switch placebo second 10 week . Similarly , participant take placebo first 10 week switch Modafinil second 10 week . Outcomes relate fatigue EDS collect weekly throughout study . Other outcome ( include general health , depression , cognitive function ) collect start period , 4 week period , end period . It hypothesize participant take Modafinil report significantly less fatigue EDS , report significantly well general health depression score , perform significantly good test cognitive performance comparison participant take placebo .</detailed_description>
