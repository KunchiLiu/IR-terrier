	<brief_summary>Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine ( ATV ) , contain novel adjuvant , CoVaccine HTâ„¢ , develop treatment high blood pressure ( hypertension ) , major risk factor serious disease heart attack stroke . Many patient high blood pressure fail take medicine prescribe generally feel well , often result poor control condition . As result , estimate 70 % patient hypertension blood pressure adequately control despite advance treatment high blood pressure . The main aim study find injection ATV give arm every 3 week 3 occasion result lower overall blood pressure measurement throughout day . The aim find ATV safe see well tolerate</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine Subjects With Mild Moderate Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One cause hypertension overactivity renin angiotensin system , main mechanism human body regulate sodium water balance . An enzyme call renin cleaves peptide protein angiotensinogen , release angiotensin I ( AI ) , convert peptide hormone call angiotensin II ( AII ) angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) . Angiotensin II hormone powerful vasoconstrictor increase blood flow vital organ . Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine act induce antibody bind angiotensin , suppress action . ATV may offer way improve control blood pressure increase patient compliance treatment . Infrequent vaccination may provide sustain reduction blood pressure afford desirable , slow onset action . Such vaccine could provide adjunct possibly replacement exist therapy patient , particularly patient compliance likely problem . This study determine three injection ATV give period six week reduce daytime BP measure ambulatory blood pressure monitoring . The study split 2 stage Stage A Stage B . The rationale behind Stage A closely evaluate safety tolerability ATV small number subject prior enrol majority subject remain portion study . Stage A include minimum 12 subject receive three injection dedicate Phase 1 facility access critical care facility . Based safety profile stage A subject , recommendation make independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee whether proceed Stage B . Stage B include approximately 112 subject . As safety tolerability closely assessed Stage A , Stage B subject monitor less closely recruited number site UK .</detailed_description>
