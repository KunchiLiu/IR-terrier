	<brief_title>Study Oral Vinorelbine Erlotinib Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Additive supraadditive activity EGFR TK-I vinorelbine demonstrate in-vitro . Clinical synergism also describe gefitinib vinorelbine NSCLC . The use cytotoxics metronomic schedule well investigated clinical set despite emerge pre-clinical data . Using establish oral cytotoxic oral vinorelbine metronomic dose-schedule attractive due oral route administration . Preclinical study show use cytotoxics low-dose protracted manner , endothelial cell preferentially affect via inhibition proliferation induction apoptosis . In addition anti-angiogenic mechanism , anti-vasculogenic process may also involved act reduce circulate endothelial progenitor mobilization viability . Moreover , also show tumours select high level acquire resistance cytotoxics induce respond use metronomic dos chemotherapy . Continuous administration metronomic oral vinorelbine , give three time week , report feasible well tolerated dos 180 mg total dose per week . Early result show activity refractory solid tumor renal cancer , NSCLC , ovarian cancer , prostate cancer , unknown primary Kaposi sarcoma . This phase I study combine erlotinib oral vinorelbine two different schedule . The conventional schedule vinorelbine ( CSV ) aim determine MTD conventional schedule oral vinorelbine give day 1 8 every 21 day plus daily erlotinib metronomic schedule vinorelbine ( MSV ) aim determine optimal metronomic dose vinorelbine give 3 time week plus daily erlotinib .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC At least one two prior line chemotherapy metastatic disease locally advance unresectable disease . There least 4 week since prior chemotherapy radiation therapy 6 week last regimen include BCNU mitomycin C Age &gt; 21 year . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % , see Appendix A ) . Life expectancy great 3 month Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional ULN creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 The effect Oral Vinorelbine develop human fetus unknown . For reason vinca alkaloid well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients receive previous vinorelbine oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor Patients progressive brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . However patient eligible brain metastasis treat whole brain radiotherapy stable corticosteroid . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Oral Vinorelbine agent use study . Prior / concomitant treatment drug know induce inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 , CYP1A1 &amp; CYP1A2 : phenytoin , carbamazepine , barbiturate , rifampicin , imidazole antifungal ( ketoconazole , fluconazole , itraconazole , metronidazole ) , omeprazole ritonavir Significant malabsorption syndrome disease affect gastrointestinal tract function Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnancy breast feeding woman childbearing potential use effective contraception , HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction Oral Vinorelbine . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . History organ allograft Patients evidence history bleeding diatheses coagulopathy Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture Because interaction risk CYP3A4 , patient concomitant treatment vitamin K antagonists phenprocoumon warfarin heparin heparinoids exclude</criteria>
