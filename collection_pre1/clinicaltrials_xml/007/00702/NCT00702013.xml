	<brief_summary>The P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) membranous transporter modulates intracellular concentration many drug play thus major role efficacy therapeutic act within lymphocyte , antiretroviral drug . We aim study evolution transporter 's expression activity lymphocytes relation human development newborn adult . We also aim study influence HIV antiretroviral treatment transporter , especially anti-protease drug , within child population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several group drug involve treatment major pathology act within lymphocyte , anticancer , immunosuppressive antiretroviral drug . These molecule depend membranous transporter get inside lymphocyte effective . Among transporter , P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) play major role , especially variety substrate among therapeutic molecule . Its expression activity well know within adult population , well modulation mediate certain group drug , protease inhibitor treatment HIV . Yet , little data child , even though expose therapeutic molecule adult . Therefore , aim study evolution transporter 's expression activity different lymphocyte population , relation human development newborn adult . We also aim study influence HIV antiretroviral treatment transporter , especially anti-protease drug , within child population . P-gp activity quantify flow cytometry , efflux fluorescent substrate , presence absence P-gp inhibitor . P-gp expression measure isolated motonucleus cell quantification mRNA encode transporter RT-PCR ( Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction ) . Patients every age , newborns adult , recruit within eight different age group three HIV status group ( HIV non infect , HIV infect untreated , HIV infect treat ) . The objective recruit ten patient age group HIV status . Blood sample obtain hospitalized child adults consent . The patient recruit one year . Our objective determine whether P-gp expression and/or activity influence age , HIV status antiretroviral treatment , order prevent , depend developmental stage , ineffectiveness toxicity due inadequate intracellular concentration . After first evaluation , principal investigator decide add one year three group eight . For two group three , genetic polymorphism Mdr1 do .</detailed_description>
