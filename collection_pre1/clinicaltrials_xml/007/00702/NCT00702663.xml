	<brief_title>Seroprevalence Hepatitis B Infection Effect Booster Response Amongst Taiwanese Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis-B virus infection endemic Taiwan 90 % adult population previously infect HBV stage life , approximately 15 - 20 % general population carrier HBV surface antigen time write . In 1984 , Taiwan implement hepatitis-B vaccination program high risk newborn . In 1986 , program extend newborn . At commencement program , HBV carrier rate amongst child 9.8 percent . Subsequently , late report ( namely 5- , 10- , 15- , 16-,18- , 20-year post mass HBV vaccination program commencement follow-up study ) , HBV infection carrier rate would appear decline continuously . However , long-term efficacy vaccination still remain one main point interest amongst Taiwan 's public-health official . Previous research indicate hepatitis B surface antibody ( HBsAb ) acquire vaccination would decline time . However , whether decline HBsAb implicate loss protection hepatitis B infection remain controversial . Reports pertain previously immunize healthcare worker ( HCW ) find protective HBsAb still persist 76 % 52 % HCW 3 13 year respectively . Anamnestic response also observe , though study population limit . Hepatitis B vaccination document provide protection HBV infection least 15 year various age group . Those young 4 year pronounce decline protective HBsAb . Our previous observation demonstrate implementation HBV vaccination program since 1984 reduced transmission HBV Taiwan . However , increase prevalence rate HBV natural infection ( anti-HBc positivity ) 1987 cohort , may suggest possibility protection HBV mass vaccination gradually decrease year . The waning-off serum anti-HBs level protective level among half student population occur eighteen year mass vaccination . As result , aim study observe evaluate initiate serum anti-HBs titer entrance health examination among undergraduate freshman university show complete 4-dose HBV vaccination infancy whose serum status ( 1 ) HBsAg negative anti-HBc negative ( 2 ) anti-HBc positive alone . For student whose anti-HBs &lt; 10 mIU/ml , additional HBV vaccination booster give accord routine governmental suggest schedule . The anamnestic effect observe group . The result study may contribute analysis effectiveness anti-HBV vaccination twenty year commencement program necessity initiate HBV booster program among Taiwanese young adult .</detailed_description>
