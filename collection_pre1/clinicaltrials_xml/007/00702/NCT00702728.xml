	<brief_summary>This study propose objective ass potential benefit induce diuresis furosemide match hydration therapy compare standard hydration prevention contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) . It expect matched hydration prove effective hydration alone , avoid overnight stay prior procedure , thus prove less costly clinically manageable solution prevention CIN .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induced Diuresis With Matched Hydration Compared Standard Hydration Contrast Induced Nephropathy ( CIN ) Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiocontrast agent ( contrast ) widely use coronary peripheral vascular catheterization procedure . Although use iodine-containing agent vital procedure , associate adverse side effect . CIN one important adverse effect contrast agent , cause substantial morbidity mortality . Although exact mechanism remain unknown , intravenous hydration catheterization procedure current treatment show reduce incidence CIN . However , patient baseline impairment renal function , hydration commonly perform rate significantly low show provide protection due fear overhydration pulmonary edema . Previous study use diuretic increase urine output prevent overhydration . In addition benefit increase urine flow , loop diuretic , furosemide , expect provide additive benefit another potential mechanism CIN , medullary ischemia , reduce sodium reabsorption , consequentially oxygen consumption , kidney . While result use mixed , appear furosemide deleterious patient become dehydrated , i.e . urine output substantially great rate hydration receive . This problem may overcome device , available market , call RenalGuard System . The System capable deliver saline solution patient amount match volume urine produce patient . The purpose match fluid replacement prevent hypovolemia may lead hypotension fluid overload.The aim study compare furosemide-induced diuresis match hydration therapy compare standard hydration .</detailed_description>
