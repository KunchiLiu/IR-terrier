	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Sclerodermatous graft versus host disease ( ScGVHD ) manifest least 100 day follow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation consider diagnostic chronic graft versus host disease ( cGVHD ) accord National Institutes Health ( NIH ) cGVHD Consensus Statement diagnostic criterion . This diagnosis make clinically histopathology . The diagnosis must confirm principal investigator ( PI ) , lead associate investigator ( LAI ) . Skin biopsy review National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Laboratory Pathology confirm diagnosis ScGVHD . Patients must measurable limitation range motion , define ScGVHD without fasciitis , restrict range motion ( ROM ) least one joint minimum deficit 25 percent . Prior therapy : Patients must cGVHD refractory least one treatment regimen cGVHD . One prior regimen must include systemic corticosteroid equivalent prednisone dose 1mg/kg/day time 14 day . Patients calcineurin inhibitor corticosteroid medically contraindicate may also eligible enrollment . Patients stabilization disease calcineurin inhibitor steroid , medication taper without disease flare also eligible . Patient must stable taper immunosuppressive regimen least one month . Age : 4 year age old time enrollment . Lower age limit set low establish age limit norm ROM score measurement criterion . Life expectancy great 6 month . Karnofsky great equal 60 percent . Patients must platelet transfusion growth factor independent time study entry . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define . Patients Gilbert syndrome exclude requirement normal bilirubin . ( Gilbert syndrome find 310 percent general population , characterize mild , chronic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia absence liver disease overt hemolysis ) . absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,000/mcL platelet great equal 50,000/mcL total bilirubin le 3 time upper limit normal aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less 5 time upper limit normal creatinine ageadjusted within normal limit OR creatinine clearance great 20mL/min/1.73 m^2 adult pediatric patient body surface area ( BSA ) great 0.97 m^2 creatinine level institutional normal great equal 40 mL/min 1.73 m^2 pediatric patient BSA le 0.97 m^2 . Age le 5 year old Maximum Serum Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL Age 5 less 10 year old Maximum Serum Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL Age 10 less 15 year old Maximum Serum Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL Age 15 year old great Maximum Serum Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL Normal cardiac function age determine echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) ( normal leave ventricular ( LV ) function measure ejection fraction shorten fraction ) . The effect imatinib mesylate develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , six month follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . All patient legal guardian ( patient less 18 year old ) must sign institutional review board ( IRB ) approve document inform consent ( chronic graft versus host disease ( cGVHD ) natural history National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) protocol allow screen procedure ) prior perform study determine patient eligibility . After confirmation patient eligibility patient legal guardian must sign protocolspecific inform consent . Pediatric patient include age appropriate discussion age appropriate assent obtain accordance National Institutes Health ( NIH ) guideline . Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) : All patient 18 year age time enrollment offer opportunity assign DPA another person make decision medical care become incapacitated cognitively impaired .
