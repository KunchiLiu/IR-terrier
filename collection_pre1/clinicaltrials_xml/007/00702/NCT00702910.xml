	<criteria>Subjects document history persistent asthma , exclusion significant pulmonary disease ( e.g . chronic bronchitis , emphysema , bronchiectasis , cystic fibrosis bronchopulmonary dysplasia ) . Male subject female subject age 18 70 year . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory . Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method list Section 8.1 appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception 2 day post lastdose . Subjects current nonsmoker , use inhale tobacco product ( snuff permit ) 12 month period precede screen visit pack history ≤ 10 pack year . Subjects clinically stable , mild moderate persistent asthma within 4 week precede screen visit screen prebronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 60 % predict defined GINA guideline [ Global Initiative Asthma ( GINA ) , 2006 ] ( abstained bronchodilator require period ) . Predicted value base ECCS 1993 normal range . Body weight ≥ 50 kg body mass index ( BMI ) within range 19 29.9 kg/m2 During screen visit , subject must demonstrate presence reversible airway disease , define increase FEV1 ≥ 12.0 % baseline absolute change ≥ 200 mL within 30 minute follow single 400 mcg salbutamol dose . ECG criterion per protocol Subjects currently take ICS total daily dose 200 500 mcg FP equivalent ICS . Subjects able willing give write informed consent take part study . Subjects past present disease , judge Investigator Medical Monitor , may affect safety subject outcome study . A screening Holter ECG trace reveals clinically concern arrhythmia . Subjects suffer upper low respiratory tract infection within 4 week screen visit Subjects history lifethreatening asthma , define asthma episode require intubation and/or associate either respiratory arrest hypoxic seizure . Asthma exacerbation require treatment oral corticosteroid : exacerbation within 3 month screen visit two exacerbation within 6 month screen visit admittance hospital asthma exacerbation within 1 year screen visit . Subjects classify suffer severe asthma define ATS guideline Subjects take high dos inhale corticosteroid ( &gt; 500 mcg FP/day equivalent ) within 8 week screen visit oral steroid within 12 week screen visit . Subjects change inhaled corticosteroid treatment within last 6 week screen expect study . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four NCE 's within 12 month prior first dose day Any adverse reaction include immediate delay hypersensitivity β2 agonist sympathomimetic drug , know suspected sensitivity constituent GW642444 inhalation powder ( e.g. , lactose , milk protein , magnesium stearate ) . Subjects positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen , positive Hepatitis C antibody HIV result ( test per site SOPs ) within 3 month start study . Neurological psychiatric disease history drug alcohol abuse would interfere subject 's proper completion protocol requirement , include compliance . Abuse alcohol define average weekly intake great 21 unit average daily intake great 3 unit ( male ) define average weekly intake great 14 unit average daily intake great 2 unit ( female ) . 1 unit equivalent half pint ( 220 mL ) beer 1 measure ( 25 mL ) spirit 1 glass ( 125 mL ) wine . The subject positive prestudy urine drug test screen . A minimum list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates , cannabinoids benzodiazepine . The subject positive prestudy alcohol smoke breath urinary test . Where participation study would result donation blood excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Subjects clinically relevant finding laboratory safety test . Subjects laboratory value outside reference range may include Investigator medical monitor agree finding would put subject risk interfere objective study . Subjects know hypersensitivity salbutamol ingredient preparation Subjects take Pgp inhibitor CYP 450 3A4 inhibitor ( e.g . Ketoconazole ) within 6 week theophylline within 2 week screen visit . Inability use novel dry powder inhaler . Pregnant female determine positive hCG ( serum urine ) test screen prior dosing . Lactating female . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol .</criteria>
