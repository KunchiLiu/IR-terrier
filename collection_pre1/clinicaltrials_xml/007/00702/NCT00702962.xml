	<brief_summary>The Phase I portion study ass maximum tolerate dose vorinostat combine carboplatin plus etoposide . The Phase II portion determine progression-free survival among patient extensive disease small cell lung cancer receive carboplatin plus etoposide vorinostat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Etoposide Combination With Vorinostat Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vorinostat inhibit growth induces apoptosis various human carcinoma cell . Furthermore , affect expression various gene necessary proliferation cancer cell . Vorinostat also appear block angiogenic signaling . Pre-treating four human cancer cell line ( include brain tumor line ) vorinostat increase kill efficiency etoposide , ellipticine , doxorubicin , cisplatin , topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin 13 . Topoisomerase II ubiquitous nuclear enzyme involve DNA replication , transcription , chromosome segregation , apoptosis . It target several anti-cancer drug include etoposide . Treatment HDAC inhibitor induce expression topoisomerase II cancer cell enhance sensitivity etoposide 14 . Early phase clinical trial demonstrate single agent anti-cancer activity vorinostat . In study , combination vorinostat carboplatin paclitaxel , demonstrate promising anticancer activity NSCLC , include histological subset patient whose tumor demonstrate neuroendocrine differentiation 8 . For reason , vorinostat rational choice combine regimen carboplatin etoposide evaluation patient SCLC-ED .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm small cell lung cancer . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm CT scan . Patients must chemotherapy naive . Previous radiotherapy allow &lt; 30 % marrow bearing bone irradiate radiotherapy complete least 2 week prior enrollment patient recover adverse effect prior radiotherapy . Age &gt; 18 year . Life expectancy great 3 month . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) . Adequate organ marrow function . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal double barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Both men woman race ethnic group eligible trial . Patients chemotherapy investigational agent indication within 30 day study enrollment . Patients radiotherapy within 2 week , prior enter study recover adverse event due therapy . Patients know brain metastasis exclude . Patients previously treat HDAC inhibitor ( use valproic acid allow 30day washout ) . Patients peripheral neuropathy CTC grade &gt; 2 exclude . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Any major surgery within 2 week prior enrollment . Minimally invasive procedure purpose diagnosis stag disease permit . History another malignancy last 5 year . Patients prior history situ cancer , basal squamous cell skin cancer eligible . Patients malignancy eligible cured surgery alone continuously disease free least 5 year . Pregnant woman exclude study irinotecan paclitaxel antineoplastic agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother agent use trial , breastfeed discontinue mother treated agent . Patients know HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C active Hepatitis A exclude . Patients systemic steroid indication , dose stabilized equivalent &lt; 10 mg/day prednisone 30 day prior study enrollment . This include short course steroid administer high dos . Patients inability absorb oral vorinostat . Patients know allergy hypersensitivity component study therapy .</criteria>
