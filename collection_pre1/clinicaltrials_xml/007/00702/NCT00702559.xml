	<brief_summary>Most patient end-stage renal disease require hemodialysis . An arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) prosthetic arteriovenous graft ( AVG ) prefer access . After surgical creation , fistular vein immediately face tremendous blood flow venous lumen gradually dilate wall thicken , produce access routinely needle deliver sufficient blood flow dialysis . However , many hemodialysis patient experience access stenosis , dysfunction , even thrombosis , common complication hemodialysis access . Most physician , in-charge nurse hemodialysis unit , patient , and/or family use traditional stethoscope convenient method evaluate patency function hemodialysis access , , session dialysis . The acoustic signal access always affect environmental noise , non-specific nature , sensitivity detect stenosis low . With development use electronic stethoscope , proprietary ambient noise acoustically cancels average 75 % distract room noise , greatly enhance overall utility . However , output acoustic signal still apprehend ear , main source bias error detection . Our study purpose apply signal processing technology transfer acoustic signal simple visual signal provide easy way read . It use professional medical staff , non-professional person responsible take care , even patient , disability , early screening detector stenosis dysfunction hemodialysis access .</brief_summary>
