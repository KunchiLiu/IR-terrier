Observational study show significant reduction sick leave depress patient treat escitalopram ( Winkler et al , 2007 ) . Outcome rigorously evaluate assess absenteeism work productivity , response remission rate , quality life , acute ( 3 month ) treatment longer-term ( 6 month ) follow-up . Research Method This 6-month , multi-centre , single-blind ( rater ) , randomize , parallel-design study ass efficacy escitalopram Tel-CBT treatment work subject MDD , compare treatment escitalopram alone . A total 150 depressed patient meet entry criterion enrol 1 year period . Eligible patient treat escitalopram 10-20 mg/d entire treatment period ( 6 month ) .

Outcomes ( HAM-D , MADRS ) primarily assess telephone raters blind treatment assignment . Other outcome measure assess patient-rated questionnaire administer internet use secure web site , rating treat physician ( CGI adverse event ) . Statistical Analysis All randomize subject least one follow-up visit include analysis base intent-to-treat . Ineligible subject inappropriately randomize exclude analysis . Missing data impute use last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) . For analysis treatment variable remain coded analyst investigator remain blinded variable identity analysis interpretation . The pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint adjust mean change baseline endpoint ( 12 week ) HAM-D score use LOCF . All comparison analyze use ANCOVA adjust baseline value centre . The secondary outcome also analyze use similar analysis , appropriate . Post hoc analysis also examine observed case data . Categorical data ( proportion sample adverse event ) analyze use chi-square test Fisher 's test cell size warrant .</detailed_description>
