	<brief_title>Study Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) -Acquired Weakness ( Handgrip Strength Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We generate hypothesis handgrip strength use develop understanding effect critical illness peripheral muscle strength . To begin develop hypothesis , good understand determinant handgrip strength need develop . As result propose perform prospective observational study examine clinical factor associate handgrip strength . Several clinical factor know associate increase risk develop ICUAP hospitalize : multiple organ failure , severe sepsis , female gender treatment like steroid . As many risk factor modifiable , opportunity intervene unclear . However , attempt well describe spectrum strength deficit experience critically ill patient may better able dissect prevent ICUAP .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>• Adult patient admit Medical ICU Age ≥ 18 year age ICU admit . Requiring mechanical ventilation least 24 hour • Moribund process withdrawal life support Patient , family physician favor continued support awaken . Profound neurologic injury associate little chance awaken . Active consideration diagnosis brain death treat physician . Known history chronic neurological disease result muscle weakness two limb . Inability perform handgrip dynamometry prior acute illness . Subject Nonenglish speaker Subject surrogate unable provide inform consent .
