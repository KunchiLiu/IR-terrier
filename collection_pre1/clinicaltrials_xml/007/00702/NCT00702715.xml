	<brief_summary>The current trial design investigate effect 4.0 mg.kg-1 sugammadex efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics subject severe renal impairment comparison subject normal renal function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison 4.0 mg/kg Sugammadex 1-2 Post Tetanic Counts ( PTC ) Renal Control Patients ( 19.4.328 ) ( P05769 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The result previous trial show safety profile sugammadex observe subject impaired renal function appreciably different subject normal renal function . Reoccurrence neuromuscular blockade observe , sugammadex safe generally well tolerated subject severe renal impairment . In previous trial , subject ( n=15 ) severe renal impairment receive dose 2.0 mg.kg-1 sugammadex . The effect propose recommend dose routine reversal , 4.0 mg.kg-1 , efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics study thus far subject severe renal impairment . The objective trial ass equivalence respect efficacy sugammadex subject normal renal function severe renal impairment , evaluate safety sugammadex subject group compare pharmacokinetic profile .</detailed_description>
