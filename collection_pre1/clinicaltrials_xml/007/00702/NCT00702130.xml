	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The pneumonia intensive care unit ( I.C.U . ) constitute frequent infection often associate application mechanical ventilation . VAP ( Ventilator - Associated Pneumonia ) define nosocomial pneumonia patient mechanical ventilatory support ( endotracheal tube tracheostomy ) 48 hour . The risk complication proportionally increase duration hospitalization . The symptom include appearance pulmonary infiltrate , fever , leukocytosis purulent tracheobronchial secretion although symptomatology always present . VAP usually cause several nosocomial specie , Acinetobacter baumanni ( often ) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Klebsiella pneumoniae . VAP frequently complicate entry bacteria circulation blood result bacteremia sepsis . In respect , disorder associate substantial morbidity devastate cost hospitalization . Notably , cost one episode VAP estimate 57000 $ per occurrence . On basis , several strategy implicate minimize risk VAP manage effectively disease ( 5-12 ) . Among , antinflammatory treatment use past influence course alter favorably outcome VAP ( 13 ) . Statins ( HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor ) , drug regulates speed composition cholesterol suspend composition cholesterol precocious stage . Recent study bring surface new attribute statin . Statins present anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory effect . They may modify regulation cytokine , ( release cellular damage ) may reduce production C-reactive protein level ( 14-19 ) . It hypothesize pleiotropic characteristic statin might useful management various disease ( 20 ) , include pneumonia . Indeed , recent study show statin treatment associate reduce risk pneumonia diabetic patient ( 18 ) . However , relationship statin reduce risk pneumonia consistent ( 19 ) . In addition prospective study investigate role statin severe form pneumonia VAP . We therefore contact double open label randomize trial investigate whether use pravastatin reduces incidence Ventilator Associated Pneumonia ICU whether related favorable outcome patient Ventilator Associated Pneumonia . MATERIALS AND METHODS Study population protocol The present prospective randomize open label control trial . The study take place intensive care ( ICU ) University Hospital Larissa General Hospital Larissa Greece . Consecutive sample use recruit patient hospitalize ICU department June 2008 August 2009 . The patient randomize receive pravastatin sodium 40 mg ( subject ) ( control ) . The trial medication commence within 24 hour ICU admission ( Day 0 ) . The treatment group receive pravastatin 30 day . Authorization give Scientific Council Ethical Committee Hospital . Diagnosis VAP base follow definition ( 1 ) : appearance new persistent pulmonary infiltrate chest radiography , fever ( &gt; 38.2ºC ) , leukocytosis leukopenia ( &gt; 12000/mm³ &lt; 4000/mm³ respectively ) , purulent tracheobronchial secretion microbiological documentation bronchial aspirate BAL . Clinical assessment microbiology Prerandomization baseline assessment include evaluation demographic data , medical history , radiography thorax , blood leukocyte count , PaO2/FiO2 , maximum body temperature day , CRP level , APACHE score entrance ICU , SOFA score , Murray score serum amyloid alpha level . Measurements parameter take place baseline ( Day 0 ) , 5th , 10th , 20th admission , day VAP diagnosis 3rd , 5th , 10th VAP day discharge ICU . Microbiology To determine bacterial specie responsible VAP , bronchial secretion BAL sample baseline ( Day 0 ) , 5th , 10th , 20th admission , day VAP diagnosis 3rd , 5th , 10th VAP day discharge ICU . Samples also collect day attend physician find clinically significant accord establish protocol ( 22 ) . Microbiology assessment include identification responsible agent ( Gram culture ) bronchial secretion BAL ( 50cc NaCl 0.9 % ) assessment antibiotic resistance . Accordingly bacterial specie categorize sensitive colistin ( 1-3 ) . VAP Management monitoring Treatment VAP base attend physician decision accord guideline . All relevant diagnostic therapeutic decision discuss daily multidisciplinary ICU meeting ( 5-12 ) . Clinical follow patient continue 6 month initiation study document late adverse event relate study . Statistical Analysis All analysis perform intention-to-treat basis , probability value 2-sided . Data present mean +/- SD 95 % CI . Analysis perform use statistical software , SISS 15 Windows . Data compare pravastatin control group . Pre- post- randomization characteristic compare use χ² test ( Fisher exact test use number cell &lt; 5 ) test . Stepwise multiple logistic linear regression analysis apply determine factor might factor might consider independent predictor unfavorable outcome score , whereas significance level 0.05 choose variable entry model . The odds ratio ( OR ) linear coefficient calculate present 95 % CI . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
