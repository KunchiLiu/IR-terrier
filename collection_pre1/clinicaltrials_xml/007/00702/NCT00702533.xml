	<brief_summary>Background : - Acid-related gastrointestinal disorder numerous may require chronic treatment maintenance , often difficult diagnose treat . Gastric analysis critical tool diagnose treat acid-related disorder ; however , present require technically difficult procedure , use nasogastric tube , costly , invasive , uncomfortable . Recently new tool , SmartPill , develop measure acid level , temperature , pressure throughout stomach , small intestine , colon swallow small capsule . Researchers interested compare current method measure stomach acid SmartPill study healthy volunteer individual acid-related gastrointestinal disorder . Objectives : - To evaluate usefulness accuracy SmartPill gastric analysis , compare current procedure . Eligibility : - Phase 1A/1B : Healthy volunteer 18 60 year age . - Phase 2 : Individuals least 18 year age diagnose Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome acid hypersecretion . - Phase 3 : Individuals least 18 year age diagnose refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease , peptic ulcer disease , idiopathic gastric hypersecretion . Design : - This study involve screen visit , 3-day inpatient study visit , possible additional outpatient visit . - Participants screen medical history physical examination , well blood urine sample . - Phase 1A/1B : Participants 3-day inpatient study visit follow procedure : - Imaging study stomach ( simultaneous gastric empty scintigraphy ) , follow special diet next day test . - Gastric analysis use nasogastric tube collect stomach acid secretion . - SmartPill study , participant ingest SmartPill wear monitor 24 48 hour collect reading . - Participants Phase 1A second outpatient SmartPill study 7 day first SmartPill study . Participants Phase 1B second SmartPill study . - Phase 2 Phase 3 : Participants 3-day inpatient study visit follow procedure : - Imaging study stomach ( simultaneous gastric empty scintigraphy ) , follow special diet next day test . - Gastric analysis use nasogastric tube collect stomach acid secretion . - SmartPill study , participant ingest SmartPill wear monitor 24 48 hour collect reading . - Phase 2 3 participant outpatient study visit direct study researcher .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Method Determining Gastric Acid Output Using Wireless Capsule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acid related disorder numerous often require chronic treatment maintenance . Many disease without symptom therefore difficult diagnose treat . Gastric analysis quantitative measurement gastric acid output critical tool diagnosis acid related disorder ongoing assessment therapy response . At present gastric analysis require technically difficult procedure , use gastric aspiration nasogastric tube , costly , invasive , uncomfortable patient . Recently introduction SmartPill , disposable pill measure pH , temperature , pressure throughout GI tract . We propose pilot study validate new method gastric analysis ingestion SmartPill meal know buffering capacity measure acidity quantity acid output stomach . We validate method comparing accept gastric aspiration method maximally stimulate condition . We study healthy volunteer validation phase study patient know acid related disorder assess usefulness patient . Interested subject report NIH outpatient gastrointestinal clinic evaluation follow 3 day in-patient admission 2 subsequent clinic visit . Subjects gastric analysis basal , meal stimulate , pharmacologically stimulate rate conventional study method . Outcomes include quantitative measurement gastric acid output unit time , normal meal stimulate acid output value healthy volunteer patient acid related disorder , assessment acid suppression patient treat variety anti-secretory medication .</detailed_description>
