	<brief_title>Study Nimotuzumab Cisplatin/Radiotherapy Locally Advanced Head Neck Squamous Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) overexpressed Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . EGFR pathway activation associate tumor growth , decrease apoptosis , increase angiogenesis . These present putative target use EGFR inhibitor either form small molecule inhibitor monoclonal antibody . Several study advance suggest application target therapy show promising response little additional toxicity . The addition EGFR monoclonal antibody radiation result well response rate locoregional control compare radiation alone . Addition EGFR monoclonal antibody compare chemotherapy alone also improve response rate patient advanced HNSCC . Nimotuzumab humanize chimeric monoclonal antibody specific extracellular domain EGFR . Several study ongoing demonstrate promising efficacy Nimotuzumab monotherapy combination radiation HNSCC , combination chemoradiation Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma . This phase II clinical trial examines feasibility EGFR inhibition use Nimotuzumab combination concurrent chemoradiotherapy locally advance unresectable HNSCC . Successful safe incorporation EGFR monoclonal antibody concurrent chemoradiation paradigm use treat locally advance HNSCC represent important advance optimisation treatment group patient .</detailed_description>
