	<brief_summary>The study conduct find many patient Human Immunodeficiency Disease ( HIV ) require combination different drug treat HIV infection . Before use different combination drug , important study see drug affect activity one another . The study aim help u understand darunavir/ritonavir raltegravir effect level abacavir blood . The purpose study ass pharmacokinetics ( drug absorb , distribute eliminate body ) abacavir absence presence darunavir/ritonavir raltegravir .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abacavir Pharmacokinetic Study Absence/Presence Darunavir/Ritonavir Raltegravir HIV-infected Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since co-administration nucleoside analogue protease inhibitor , soon integrase inhibitor , form integral part highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) combination may result unexpected drug interaction ( demonstrated interaction protease inhibitor TFV ) , therefore important elucidate impact ARV co-administration drug level . The risk ABC hypersensitivity ( HSR ) preclude study agent healthy volunteer therefore study perform HIV-infected subject . Clinical efficacy drug relate plasma concentration [ Boffito , 2005 ] important know whether ABC impact level therapeutic agent may impact clinical efficacy . Moreover , still unknown whether ABC exposure alter ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor darunavir new HIV drug raltegravir . Raltegravir soon approve treatment HIV Europe United States . Pharmacogenetics hold promise HIV treatment complexity potential toxicity multi antiretroviral drug therapy prescribe long period . Thus far , candidate gene examine limited number allelic variant , number confirm association already emerge . From public health perspective , antiretroviral medication become increasingly available racially ethnically diverse population worldwide , understanding genetic structure population may allow u anticipate impact adverse response , even group represent drug registration trial . The exist literature pharmacogenetic determinant antiretroviral drug exposure , drug toxicity , well genetic marker associate rate disease progression underline recent advance occur past year . However , expect larger-scale comprehensive genome approach profoundly change landscape knowledge future . Additional study need assess implication long-term response antiretroviral agent . For reason plan collect single blood sample participant intensive pharmacokinetic study , one , order able investigate association genetic polymorphism drug disposition gene ( encode cytochrome P450 isoenzymes transmembrane transporter ) drug exposure . A candidate gene approach utilised examine locus interest . This procedure provide potentially important information genetic influence plasma drug concentration give insight improve management HIV-infected patient individualise therapy . These study power genetic association enable u build data base genotype-phenotype . Prospective genetic study would need plan base preliminary data .</detailed_description>
