	<brief_summary>Because increase fall problem , mainly due impaired gait balance ability partly cause trip , study investigate fall risk detect fall related movement characteristic detect stumble inclusive compensation mechanism recover trip . Based promising result use accelerometry accurate objective gait analysis , fall risk measure young old ( &gt; 60y ) subject use triaxial accelerometer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identify Subjects Risk Falling Using Acceleration Based Gait Analysis System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate fall risk objectively , fall related movement characteristic ( base gait balance ) ability compensate near fall analyze young old ( &gt; 60y ) subject standardize laboratory condition . Four test perform link specific movement parameter , balance performance ability recover trip fall risk : 1 . Fall risk assess use Tinetti Scale , gold standard fall risk assessment . This scale consist gait balance score . Based scale , subject classify risk/ risk fall . 2 . A gait test perform analyze movement parameter . Subjects walk 6 time 20 meter distance prefer speed small ( 56mmx61mmx15mm ) , light weight ( 5g ) ambulant accelerometer attach sacrum elastic belt . The accelerometer measure acceleration body three direction ( anterior-posterior , media-lateral cranial-caudal ) sample frequency 100Hz . 3 . The balance ability test perform 4 balance task accelerometer measure movement body . Subjects stand foot close normal foam surface eye open close . 4 . Finally stumble experiment do assess ability compensate trip . Subjects ask walk preferred speed treadmill , wear accelerometer attach sacrum . After 2 minute normal walking , stumble simulate unexpectedly use extend trip leash attach leg . The subject able move freely due unwind wind cord spill fix frame behind treadmill . This spill block device capable block leash shortly . During mid initial swing one leg , examiner block leash cause subject trip . Falling , however , possible due safety harness attach ceiling . When harness start bear weight emergency switch engage stop treadmill immediately . After perturbation , subject get several second recover new perturbation apply . This measurement repeat walk slow ( 40 % Fr prefer speed ) fast ( 20 % Fr prefer speed ) speed . The whole experiment record video validate acceleration base stumble detection . To investigate underlying mechanism age relate mobility change , two test incorporate : - The cognition subject test use reaction time test . Subjects sit behind computer middle forefinger two key typewriter . Four square appear computer screen . Or square red one change green ( =uncued condition ) two red square appear leave ( right ) side one square right ( leave ) side turn green . Subjects push correspond key typewriter fast also accurate possible . With test ability change automatic response ( stead responding leave stimulus appear leave ) investigate use reaction time . First subject get instruction , get possibility try exercise 10 time , afterwards real test start . 120 attempt perform cue uncued stimuli appear different time interval ( 100ms , 250ms , 500ms , 750ms 12000 m ) . - Muscle strength right low leg test use Cybex . Subjects produce maximal force extension flexion test . All acceleration data analyze use specific algorithm program Matlab ( c ) . Statistical analysis perform SPSS use pearson correlation investigate correlation gait parameter , balance characteristic ability recover trip . Moreover Pearson correlation regression analysis do investigate relation cognition muscle strength fall risk ( gait , stumble recovery balance ) . Pearson correlation also use validate objective gait balance test Berg Balance Scale . Differences muscle strength , cognition gait , balance compensation ability young old subject investigate use ANOVA ( p &lt; 0.005 ) .</detailed_description>
