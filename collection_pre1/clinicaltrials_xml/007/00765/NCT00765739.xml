	<detailed_description>Declines whole skeletal muscle strength size feature commonly associate age . Aging reduces number fiber whole muscle , explain loss muscle mass . Frontera et al studied muscle strength , cross sectional area , contractile property skin part single fiber quadriceps muscle . He find strength whole muscle cross sectional area knee extensor significantly high young men compare old subject , difference old young subject whole muscle strength adjust whole muscle cross sectional area ( specific tension ) . He also find muscle fiber young men strong muscle fiber old men express myosin heavy chain isoform even adjust size . Therefore conclude abnormality quantity and/or function contractile regulatory protein could explain reduction ability muscle fiber generate force . Along loss muscle fiber , atrophy fiber also attribute age process . This atrophy find selective type II muscle fiber . Lexel et al find study do cross section whole vastus lateralis muscle 20 men ( 19-84 year age ) mean Cross Sectional Area ( CSA ) type II fiber muscle older individual average 35 % small mean CSA type I approximately 6 % small young individual . Aging muscle Maintaining muscle strength size age become significant issue elderly try keep independent living good quality life . Several study old men woman proven effectiveness resistance exercise reverse sarcopenia relate problem . However order increase size type II muscle fiber need apply high intensity exercise ( 80 % 1 RM ) , apply low resistance exercise intense do large number repetition . The use electrical stimulation well document improve quadriceps femoris muscle torque output . Numerous experiment do characterize pattern activation muscle fiber electrically stimulate muscle contraction , result show recruitment motor unit electrically induced muscle contraction non selective . In word , type I II fiber may equal chance recruit electrically induced muscle contraction . It find NMES likely activate type II muscle fiber relatively low force level compare voluntary exercise . If find true , may alternative intervention improve muscle strength muscle hypertrophy elderly individual could perform high intensity exercise achieve benefit . This alternative approach might result improve overall physical function individual . The quadriceps muscle propose treated significant relationship quadriceps muscle strength dynamic stability chair rise gait prefer speed functionally limit elderly individual Methods This study two group , repeat measure , randomize clinical trial . Baseline measurement quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area , type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area , quadriceps power output , time go test , SPPB , stair climb test ramp power test obtain subject prior intervention . Following baseline assessment subject randomly assign either NMES group comparable isometric strengthen exercise group . A set sequentially numbered envelope create document indicate intervention assignment place sequentially numbered envelope . Upon completion baseline assessment , study coordinator take next envelope sequence open envelope . The study coordinator assign subject group base randomize group assignment information obtain seal envelop . During intervention period study subject receive either NMES isometric strengthen exercise 3 time week 12 week . Each session last 15-30 minute . Post training outcome measure take end 12 week intervention period .</detailed_description>
