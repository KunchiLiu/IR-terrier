	<brief_summary>Many type head neck cancer local spread neck . As selective neck dissection perform part treatment . The neck divide various level . Selective neck dissection target area likely harbor cancer cell specific type head neck cancer . Level IIB particularly controversial last year , rate cancer spread area show quite low ( 0-8 % ) . Moreover , spinal accessory nerve ( involved shoulder function ) run area , theoretical risk cause post-operative shoulder weakness . As , question whether remove level IIB , know low chance contain disease spread , worth risk decreased shoulder function . Some would argue potential diseased site remove cost . While advocate balance disease cure function maintain . However , need determine impact dissect IIB shoulder function . At institution , rate poor shoulder function associate selective neck dissection perceive quite low . This study design test observation . Hypothesis : Neck dissection include level IIb head neck cancer patient lead bad shoulder function quality life level IIb preserve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Shoulder Function After Level IIB Neck Dissection : A Randomized Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The lymphatic fluid upper aerodigestive tract ( UADT ) drain various level neck . When cancer occur UADT , potential local metastatic spread neck exists , thus necessitate treatment neck . Ideally potential neck structure , could harbor cancer cell provide dock recurrence , would eradicate . Unfortunately , radical treatment show cause extreme rate morbidity little extra oncologic benefit . Thus , head neck oncologists strived create treatment paradigm , maximize cure rate minimize morbidity . Finding intricate balance translate selective neck dissection ( SND ) post-operative RT.1 Increased understanding lymphatic drainage pattern head neck lead widespread use SND . Through removal lymphatics neck level high risk harbor cancer cell , base primary tumor site , important neck structure may preserve . As , treatment remain oncologically sound avoids morbidity associate predecessor , radical neck dissection . 1 One structure preserve SND spinal accessory nerve ( SAN ) , responsible provide motor innervation sternocleidomastoid ( SCM ) trapezius muscle . Thus , intricately involved shoulder function . The nerve exist skull base jugular foramen obliquely pass neck level II . It pass posterior SCM eventually enter trapezius muscle . Through trajectory , divide level II IIa ( anterior SAN ) IIb ( posterior SAN ) . It known shoulder function significantly deteriorate level V dissected.2 This likely due traction devascularization injury long portion SAN neck . As , practice become level V leave intact case harbor detectable disease occult disease incidence low . Due intimate relationship IIb SAN , also potential injury nerve area.2 As , debate arisen necessity include IIb neck dissection specimen . Studies show prevalence occult nodal disease IIb range 0-8.7.5 % depend overall n stage neck.3-5 These figure lead head neck surgeon weigh benefit excise lymphatic tissue low nodal metastatic rate versus excise area decrease post-operative shoulder function.6 Because incidence occult metastasis IIb low3-5 , become standard care many center spare IIb , oncologically feasible , SND preserve shoulder function . Because patient receive post-operative RT think RT address occult disease . Unfortunately , rely RT pose two problem : 1. occult disease may respond RT 2. leave level IIb intact provide lymphatic route recurrence despite undergo RT By surgically remove portal lymphatic disease spread issue eliminate . The goal study demonstrate minimal manipulation SAN associate IIb dissection significant impact post-operative shoulder function . If case , standard practice change include IIb SND specimen case level IIa dissect well . This would eliminate lymphatic tissue , may harbor disease . Note : At University Alberta , head neck surgeon prefer spare IIb SND , others prefer resect . Thus , protocol study manipulate current standard practice . *Reference number correspond article `` Citations '' section . The citation order appearance text .</detailed_description>
