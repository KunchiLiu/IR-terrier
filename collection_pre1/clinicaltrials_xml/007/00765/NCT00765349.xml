	<brief_summary>REASON FOR STUDY Major non-cardiac surgery high degree morbidity mortality . Recently , suitable measurement patient 's preoperative cardiorespiratory reserve , perform non-invasively cardiopulmonary exercise testing , show predictive outcome follow non-cardiac surgery . Although exact mechanism behind poor reserve population unknown , poor cardiac function particularly diastolic dysfunction likely important . AIMS The aim present study investigate role diastolic dysfunction determine poor cardiorespiratory reserve elderly patient undergo major non-cardiac surgery . This provide suitable information inform therapeutic preoperative interventional study . OBJECTIVES AND METHODS 1 . To determine presence severity diastolic dysfunction , measure preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram , series elderly surgical patient undergo major elective non-cardiac surgery 2 . To investigate relationship diastolic dysfunction poor cardiorespiratory function follow exercise measure non-invasive test include cardiopulmonary exercise testing , non-invasive blood pressure measurement biochemical analysis 3 . To determine whether patient poor diastolic dysfunction likely bad outcomes follow major surgery compare show evidence diastolic dysfunction . Outcomes measured term length hospital stay early postoperative morbidity ( validate score system ) mortality .</brief_summary>
