	<brief_summary>This study patient undergo two-step procedure : Step 1 - Physicians examine problem area skin ONLY record result . Step 2 - Physicians perform TBSE record result . Eventual lesion suggestive melanoma non-melanoma skin cancer record step 1 step 2 examination finally biopsied histopathologically diagnose . Exceptions biopsy may include patient multiple non-melanoma skin cancer ( e.g . actinic keratoses basal cell carcinomas ) . Each center provide electronic data sheet patient record , alternatively , paper record form . Endpoints study new parameter concern standard care skin cancer screen . We expect conclude TBSE enables clinicians discover increase number skin cancer thus result early detection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinicans perform two-step examination skin cancer , clinical examination individual lesion aid use dermoscopy , need . In first step , physician perform inspection problem area uncover area , lesion suggestive melanoma non-melanoma skin cancer note . In second step , TBSE perform . Following examination , lesion suggestive melanoma non-melanoma skin cancer excise biopsied . Histopathologic diagnosis record biopsied excised lesion . Statistical analysis : We calculate absolute risk proportion individual target disease divide individual risk . The number need examine calculate divide individual risk number individual target disease . Confidence interval proportion calculate use standard formula base binomial distribution . Chi square test use comparison proportion . Continuous variable present mean standard deviation ( SD ) unless otherwise specify . For univariate multivariate analysis use odds ratio derive logistic regression estimate relative risk confidence interval . All p-values report 2-tailed . Statistical significance define P &lt; 0.05 . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS software , version 16.0 ( SPSS , Chicago , Ill , US ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Consecutive , unselected adult ( 18 year ) patient skin disorder . Skin disorder must localize limited body area NOT require total body skin examination ( TBSE ) diagnose and/or treat . Patients ask need TBSE main reason consultation . A patient must also exclude significant part body undressed diagnosis and/or treatment ( i.e . shirt trouser remove diagnosis and/or treatment , patient must exclude ) . patient age 18 year . patient agree get TBSE .</criteria>
