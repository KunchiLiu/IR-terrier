	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) common lethal autosomal recessive disease among Caucasians . While pulmonary disease CF receive attention , gastrointestinal disease occur &gt; 95 % CF individual contribute significant morbidity , mortality decrease quality life . The abdominal pain CF usual chronic nature , etiology usually find , despite medical test standard cause abdominal pain . Helicobacter pylorus ( Hp ) increasingly recognize etiology peptic ulcer disease upper low gastrointestinal tract diseases.1 The role Hp play CF abdominal pain elucidate . Our long-term goal understand relationship chronic HP infection abdominal pain pediatric CF patient . The specific objective proposal utilize current state-of-the-art testing HP determine prevalence Hp CF patient age 5 older . The central hypothesis Cystic fibrosis subject significant abdominal pain increase incidence Helicobacter pylorus determine urea breath test stool antigen test . The rationale propose research elucidate causal relationship CF patient abdominal pain Hp , begin treatment infection improve quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abdominal pain Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis common lethal autosomal recessive disease among Caucasians . CF cause single gene mutation chromosome 7 , encodes membrane protein , cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) . CFTR channel dysfunction result progressive pulmonary disease , primary cause morbidity mortality associate disease . Therapies direct slow progression lung disease increase USA median survival 32.2 years.2 Abdominal complaint common among CF patient . Littlewood et al . report 31 % child regular complaint abdominal pain.3 Ravilly et al . perform retrospective chart review CF patient refer treatment pain service expired.4 They determine pain common CF 19 % population chronic complaint abdominal pain , third behind chest pain headaches.4 This study likely underestimated prevalence abdominal pain CF , evaluate end stage lung disease group patient frequently eat severe pain disease process ( i.e . headache hypercarbia and/or hypoxia , chest pain rib fracture ) . Known cause CF relate abdominal pain : 1 ) malabsorption due pancreatic steatorrhea , 2 ) gastroesophageal reflux , 3 ) esophagitis , 4 ) gastritis , 5 ) peptic ulcer disease , 6 ) pancreatitis , 7 ) Crohn 's disease , 8 ) distal intestinal obstructive syndrome ( DIOS ) , 9 ) biliary duct disease include cholocystitis cholangitis , 10 ) intussception , 11 ) acute chronic gastrointestinal infection , 12 ) acute appendicitis , 13 ) constipation . Given long list potential cause , CF patient frequently undergo intensive examination determine etiology abdominal pain.4 The test unfortunately always reveal etiology . Helicobacter pylori World-wide , Helicobacter pylorus ( Hp ) increasingly recognize etiology peptic ulcer disease upper low gastrointestinal tract diseases.1 With CF population , The role Hp play abdominal pain elucidate . Two study attempt look epidemiology Hp CF ; however , approach utilized study determine inadequate . Johansen et al . Israel et al . attempt utilize Hp serology determine prevalence CF population determine significant cross-reactivity Hp Pseudomonas aeruginosa antigens.10 , 11 . They conclude different mode test require Hp evaluate CF population . To knowledge , evaluation Hp CF use new diagnostic test available . Testing Helicobacter pylorus Since isolation spiral urease-producing Helicobacter pylorus bacteria ( H. pylori ) 1983 Drs . Marshall Warren5 , significant body evidence accumulate indicate bacteria important pathogen upper GI tract humans 6,7 . The causal relation ship H.pylori chronic active gastritis , duodenal ulcer , gastric ulcer well document 8 , 9 . Methods available detect current infection human stomach Hp generally divide two general type : Invasive Non-invasive . Invasive method include esophageogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) collection gastric biopsy . These biopsy examine one detection method : histological examination stain tissue , microbiological culture organism , direct detection urease activity tissue ( example , CLO test ) . Biopsy base method expensive , entail great patient risk discomfort non-invasive test , may give false negative result due sample error colonization gastric mucosa patchy 6 . The non-invasive test include several serological test detect serum antibody Hp . A positive result test distinguish current infection past exposure HP , therefore , conclusive indicator current gastrointestinal colonization . The urea breath test base principal urease enzyme present human tissue . Urease presence indicative urease produce organism stomach , likely HP . The test sensitivity specificity 90 % negative predictive value great 95 % positive predictive value 90 % .12 A third non-invasive test Hp stool antigen test also sensitivity specificity 90 % , high positive negative predictive value ( &gt; 95 % ) .13 Major confound issue HP test systemic antibiotic exposure , lead false negative test partial treatment.14 This especially problematic CF population , frequently systemic antibiotic chronic suppurative bronchitis . Thus , part inclusion criterion , include subject antibiotic least 14 day prior enrollment . The CF patient allow continue nebulized antibiotic prophylactic dose Azythromycin , analysis perform determine result false negative compare result stool antigen test . Clinical measure abdominal pain This study also design determine whether prevalence Hp relate decrease quality life , documented suggest pathological role Hp CF . Our objective use two validated quality life instrument study : The PedsQL ( Pediatric Quality Life Inventory ) Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale ( GSRS ) .15 The PedsQL modular instrument measure health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) child adolescent age 2 18 . The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales multidimensional child self-report parent proxy-report scale develop generic core measure integrate PedsQL Disease-Specific Modules . The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales consist 23 item applicable healthy school community population , well pediatric population acute chronic health condition . The GSRS questionnaire involve 15 item use Likert scale focus gastroesophageal reflux , abdominal pain , constipation , indigestion diarrhea . It use scale from1 4 .</detailed_description>
