	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , ixabepilone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Hydroxychloroquine may help ixabepilone work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose ixabepilone give together hydroxychloroquine see well work treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Hydroxychloroquine Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - The primary objective study assess antitumor activity , measure tumor response rate , patient receive regimen third-line treatment . ( Phase II ) Secondary - To measure duration response respond patient . - To measure time progressive disease . - To measure survival time . - To characterize quantitative qualitative toxicity regimen patient . - To develop pharmacodynamic marker autophagy detection patient specimen . - To characterize effect hydroxychloroquine autophagy patient vivo . - To investigate whether estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , and/or HER2 status breast tumor correlate treatment response . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I dose-escalation study ixabepilone follow phase II study . During first course , patient receive ixabepilone IV 3 hour day 1 oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily day 3-21 . On subsequent course , patient receive ixabepilone IV 3 hour day 1 oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
