	<brief_title>Use Ixmyelocel-T ( Formerly Cardiac Repair Cell CRC Treatment ) Patients With Heart Failure Due Dilated Cardiomyopathy ( IMPACT-DCM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure remain major public health problem , affect 5 million patient US 550,000 new diagnosis make year . Heart failure lead cause hospitalization person 65 year age cost exceed $ 29 billion annually . Prognosis poor patient hospitalize heart failure . The mortality risk heart failure hospitalization 11.3 % 30 day , 33.1 % 1 year well 50 % within 5 year ( Hunt SA ; et al. , 2005 ) . These number emphasize need develop implement effective treatment manage heart failure . This study target subset heart failure patient population , namely diagnose dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) defines dilate cardiomyopathy cardiac condition wherein ventricular chamber exhibit increase diastolic systolic volume low ( &lt; 40 % ) ejection fraction . DCM report affect 108,000 150,000 patient U.S . This study prospective , stratify , randomize , open-label , control , multi-center study assess safety profile efficacy CRCs treat patient DCM . It enroll total 40 patient 5 site U.S .</detailed_description>
