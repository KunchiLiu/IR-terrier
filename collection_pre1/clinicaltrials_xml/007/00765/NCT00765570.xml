	<brief_title>Study Advanced Bulky Malignancies With Spatially Fractioned Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate response radiation therapy large bulky tumor influence add single dose 15 Gy grid radiotherapy . To accomplish , patient large bulky tumor lung , abdomen pelvis randomize receive either standard palliative radiation palliative radiation plus single fraction grid radiation . Tumor response , pain relief duration response , pain control monitor . Toxicity treatment also follow . The hypothesis study grid radiation produce significant improvement tumor response pain control produce increase acute late toxicity .</detailed_description>
