	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect switch antiretroviral combination include efavirenz ( Sustiva® ) , lopinavir/ritonavir ( Kaletra® ) atazanavir/ritonavir ( Reyataz®/Norvir® ) individual experience side effect one agent , replace new HIV medication call Darunavir also give ritonavir ( Norvir® ) . The study primarily investigate effect change medication subject viral load ( level HIV virus blood ) , immunological parameter ( CD4 count ) safety parameter ( cholesterol ) also quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NNRTI/PI Toxicity Switch Darunavir Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The advent highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) revolutionise treatment HIV disease , patient physician enjoy marked reduction HIV related morbidity mortality . However , long term therapeutic success become realistic goal treatment , increase report toxicity associate therapy . Indeed since advent HAART major reason change therapy lack efficacy associate drug regimens toxicity associate individual agent . Although potential adverse event associate antiretrovirals manifold signature treatment-limiting toxicity associate particular agent EFV CNS/neuropsychiatric adverse event , LPV/r gastrointestinal toxicity ATV/r jaundice . A recent study perform Chelsea Westminster hospital show 61 % regimen switch due toxicity majority occur 12 week therapy . Darunavir recently license protease inhibitor require ritonavir boosting.Currently DRV/r license use treatment-experienced individual . In triple-class experienced patient ritonavir boost darunavir associate great viral load reduction combine optimize background ( OB ) OB alone . A study PI experience patient randomized receive Kaletra ritonavir boost darunavir optimise background therapy show significantly high rate virological suppression DRV/r arm ; rate toxicity similar overall less diarrhoea DRV/r Kaletra arm . Darunavir license twice daily high barrier development resistance . DRV/r dose 800/100mg daily compare LPV/r treatment-naïve subject . DRV/r non-inferior LPV/r overall perform significantly well LPV daily subject high baseline viral load . DRV/r LPV/r also compare head head 'early'treatment-experienced patient ( fail first second line therapy LPV-naive ) . Overall DRV/r exhibit superiority LPV/r 77 % 67 % achieve viral suppression le 50 copies/ml intent-to-treat analysis respectively ( 95 % confidence interval difference 2-17 % ; p &lt; 0.0001 ) . Animal study show low risk teratogenesis associate DRV . This study aim investigate whether substitution NNRTI/PI ritonavir boost darunavir lead resolution toxicity associate drug , continue virological suppression immunological reconstitution whether associate improvement quality life .</detailed_description>
