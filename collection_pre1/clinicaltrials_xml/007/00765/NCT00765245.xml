	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lenalidomide may stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . It may also stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . It yet know whether lenalidomide effective without rituximab treating diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study lenalidomide see well work give without rituximab standard chemotherapy treat patient diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide With Without Rituximab After Standard Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess 1-year disease-free relapse-free survival patient high- high/intermediate-risk diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma treat maintenance therapy comprise lenalidomide without rituximab follow standard chemotherapy . Secondary - To assess 2-year disease-free survival patient treat regimen . - To define safety toxicity profile regimen . - To perform antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay use peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample patient . - To assess change number natural killer cell flow cytometric analysis . - To evaluate cytokine include , limited , sIL-2R , IL-6 , IL-15 , IL-12 , TNF-α , IFN-γ patient . - To study KIR genotype receptor FCγR polymorphism . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive lenalidomide arm I rituximab IV day 8 course 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell collect periodically correlative study . Samples analyze change number natural killer cell flow cytometry ; antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay ; cytokine ; KIR genotype receptor ; FCγR polymorphism . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
