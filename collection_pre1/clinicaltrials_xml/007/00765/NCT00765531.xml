	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study proposal pediatric urinary stone former genetic risk factor predispose urinary stone production . 50-60 % pediatric stone patient positive family history urinary stone disease . Several genetic mutation identify predispose patient various type urinary stone . These genetic mutation also lead significant sequela besides stone , include osteopenia/osteoporosis ( bone loss ) . Furthermore , metabolic abnormality identify 50 % pediatric stone former , improved/alleviated medical intervention help decrease rate stone formation need hospitalization surgical intervention .</brief_summary>
