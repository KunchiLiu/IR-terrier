	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Octreotide Implant Patients With Acromegaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct 3 phase : Screening , Primary Treatment Phase ( ie , Day 1 Week 24 ) , Extension Phase ( Post Week 24 Week 48 ) . Primary efficacy safety determine Primary Treatment Phase . Eligible patient randomized Primary Treatment Phase ; 3 1 ratio receive 6 month open-label treatment either 84 mg octreotide implant monthy Injections S-LAR . Each patient study return investigational center every 4 week ; safety efficacy assessment perform visit . All patient complete Primary Treatment Phase continue meet eligibility criterion offer opportunity enter Extension Phase ; patient enter Extension Phase treat octreotide implant 6 months.During Extension Phase , patient return investigational center every 4 week ; safety efficacy assessment perform visit .</detailed_description>
