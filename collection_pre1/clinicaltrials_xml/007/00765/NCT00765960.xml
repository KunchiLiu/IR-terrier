	<brief_title>Evaluation Outcomes Using Amo Advanced CustomVue Ilasik Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laser situ keratomileusis ( LASIK ) surgery perform worldwide since 1990 . More recently , customize corneal ablation utilize wavefront-sensing technology determine optical aberration patient 's cornea optimize LASIK surgery result . Prior introduction wavefront-guided laser vision correction , variable use correct refractive error limit sphere cylinder . With introduction wavefront laser vision correction surgeon able provide individualize laser-induced corneal tissue resection base sphere cylinder measurement , also attempt treat 3rd 6th higher-order aberration ( HOAs ) utilize Zernike polynomial wavefront reconstruction Fourier transformation . Advanced Medical Optics , Inc. ( AMO ) recently introduce Advanced CustomVue™ iLASIK procedure utilizes WaveScan WaveFront® System , STAR S4 IR™ Excimer Laser System IntraLase™ FS System technology provide broad range wavefront-guided FDA approve usage unprecedented level precision accuracy patient undergo LASIK surgery . The procedure leverage Iris Registration , Fourier algorithm , VSS™ VRR™ technologies 3D ActiveTrak™ ensure precise corneal ablation.1 , 2</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects MUST fulfill follow condition qualify enrollment trial Both eye must manifest refractive error 0.50 D 6.00 D , cylinder component 3.00 D , maximum manifest spherical equivalent 6.00 D. 21 year age old time preoperative examination . Both eye must BSCVA 20/20 good ; Both eye must minimum pupil size least 6.0mm dim illumination wavescan . Both eye must demonstrate refractive stability confirm clinical record previous glass . Refractive stability shall document change less equal 0.50 diopter ( sphere cylinder ) exam least 12 month prior baseline examination . The astigmatic axis must also within 15 degree eye cylinder great 0.50 D. Willing able comply schedule visit study procedure . Subjects ANY follow condition eligibility exam may NOT enrolled trial . Subjects use concurrent topical systemic medication may impair heal , include limited : antimetabolite , isotretinoin ( Accutane® ) within 6 month treatment , amiodarone hydrochloride ( Cordarone® ) within 12 month treatment . Also , use topical systemic corticosteroid , whether chronic acute Subjects history follow medical condition , condition could affect wound healing : uncontrolled diabetes , collagen vascular disease , autoimmune disease , immunodeficiency disease , ocular herpes zoster simplex , endocrine disorder ( include , limited unstable thyroid disorder diabetes ) , lupus , rheumatoid arthritis . Subject must history prior intraocular corneal surgery ( include cataract extraction ) , active ophthalmic disease abnormality ( include , limited , blepharitis , recurrent corneal erosion , dry eye syndrome , neovascularization &gt; 1mm limbus ) , clinically significant lens opacity , clinical evidence trauma ( include scar ) , evidence glaucoma propensity narrow angle glaucoma either eye . The subject must evidence keratoconus , corneal irregularity , abnormal videokeratography either eye . Subjects know sensitivity inappropriate responsiveness medication use postoperative course . Patients achieve Iris registration time wavescan . Patients seek monovision Any clinically significant , serious severe medical psychiatric condition may increase risk associate study participation may interfere interpretation study result . Participation ( current participation ) investigational drug device trial within previous 30 day prior start date trial . The principal investigator reserve right declare patient ineligible nonevaluable base medical evidence indicate patient unsuitable trial .</criteria>
