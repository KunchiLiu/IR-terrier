	<brief_summary>A multi-center , open-label , two-arm , dose-escalation study establish safety , tolerability , MTD , schedule TLI administer intravenously 30 minute infusion adult subject advance solid tumor relapse , refractory standard therapy , standard therapy available . The two dosing regimen evaluate : - Arm A : TLI dose Days 1 8 21-day treatment cycle ( Starting dose : 1 mg/m2 ) - Arm B : TLI dose Day 1 21-day treatment cycle ( Starting dose : 2 mg/m2 ) When one two arm reach MTD , future subject enrol remain study arm MTD arm reach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study utilize accelerate design small initial cohort size allow few subject enrol sub-therapeutic dos low start dos arm study . Initial cohort include one subject dose escalation 100 % increment single Grade 2 toxicity relate study drug DLT occur Cycle 1 . Dose escalation proceed MTD exceed . MTD define average high dose level 2 6 subject experience DLT previous dose level , provide additional DLTs occur . Subjects discontinue TLI treatment completion Cycle 1 reason toxicity evaluable determination MTD replace . The study consist screening period , treatment period , post-treatment period . Subjects follow 30 day last TLI dose . Safety tolerability parameter include clinical laboratory assessment , vital sign , physical examination , adverse event ( AEs ) .</detailed_description>
