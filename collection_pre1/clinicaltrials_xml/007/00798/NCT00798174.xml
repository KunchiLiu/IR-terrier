	<brief_summary>When implantable cardiac defibrillator implant ( ICDs ) , defibrillation threshold ( DFT ) , amount energy require effectively terminate life-threatening arrhythmia determine . The device program discharge large amount energy order provide safety margin . In patient , DFT high , adequate safety margin programmable . Placement defibrillation lead azygos vein find helpful patient . This goal trial attempt quantify reduction DFT result</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Azygos Vein Coil Defibrillation Threshold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing placement ICD primary secondary prevention sudden cardiac death ask participate . Patients undergo implantation standard right ventricular ICD lead time ICD implantation . In addition , patient receive another high voltage ICD lead place azygos vein previously describe literature ( 1 ) . After sedate patient , DFT determine use binary search algorithm . This consist test device give output first shock induce VF . Should shock fail , external defibrillation attempt , standard method perform DFT test . As per standard method DFT testing , VF induce second time , shock strength dependent success first shock . If first shock unsuccessful , second high output . If first shock successful , second low output . A third shock deliver , base success failure precede shock define DFT . Of note , device program give multiple shock one episode , VF necessarily need induced time . For example , VF could induce , device program give 20J shock follow 23J shock successful , thus limit number VF induction require . DFT test do use standard configuration high voltage lead well use azygos lead . We hypothesize use azygos lead result low DFT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any patient undergoing elective placement ICD primary secondary prevention sudden cardiac death eligible . Exclusion criterion include contraindication endovascular ICD implantation include limited ; active infection , occlude venous access , inability perform DFT test secondary inability sedate patient hemodynamic compromise . Any contraindication ICD inability place azygos vein coil .</criteria>
