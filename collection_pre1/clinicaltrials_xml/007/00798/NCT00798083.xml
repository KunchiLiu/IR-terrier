	<brief_summary>To investigate topical amitriptyline 2 % , ketamine 1 % , lidocaine 5 % pluronic lecitine organogel ( AKL PLO gel ) improve management neuropathic pain radiation skin reaction adjunctively well standard treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuropathic Pain Caused Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Topical amitriptyline ketamine topical lidocaine alone show improve management neuropathic pain nonmalignant subject . Anecdotal experience show improvement use three topical drug combine radiation skin reaction . There currently research evidence use three compound intervention . This study aim target subject pain radiation therapy receive adequate relief standard intervention may eligible receive alternate intervention . 2 . Hypothesis : Topical AKL PLO gel effectively safely reduce neuropathic pain experience patient radiotherapy induced skin reaction . 3 . Justification : Standard treatment painful radiation skin reaction moist desquamation consist saline soak , silver sulfadiazine oral analgesic . However , sometimes pain exceeds standard intervention , patient sulfa allergic patient intolerant oral analgesic opioids . AKL PLO gel target neuropathic pain may use alternatively standard intervention . The participation rate help estimate feasibility large sample size study look efficacy .</detailed_description>
