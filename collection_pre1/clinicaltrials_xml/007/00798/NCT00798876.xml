	<brief_summary>Studies pattern many men get prostate cancer country show environment contributes high incidence prostate cancer United States . Epidemiology study suggest influence may reduce diet men risk get prostate cancer . Although exact nature effect diet completely know , amount fat eaten appear affect number men get prostate cancer . The type fat also seem matter . Eating type fat call omega-3 polyunsaturated fat associate decreased prostate cancer risk . Omega-3 fat come fish quite different type fat animal vegetable ( omega-6 fat ) . Because exact mechanism reduction prostate cancer risk know , blood test indication , call marker , discover would show effect work . Study doctor design study try find marker blood test men prostate cancer , find diet supplement omega-3 type fat fish oil help reduce marker , hence indicate help reduce cancer men . These men compare men prostate cancer whose diet contain fish-oil fat . The men choose prostate cancer schedule operation prostate gland remove . They choose randomly give fish-oil diet regular Western diet comparison 4 8 week . Their blood check begin diet . After 4-to-8-week period , operation . Their blood check sample remove prostate examine tell diet effect cancer marker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . To establish validate intermediate biomarkers prostate cancer prevention trial conduct dietary intervention trial low-fat diet omega-3 fatty acid supplement men undergo radical prostatectomy . In initial trial feasible intervene diet obtain tissue serum bioassay biomarker development . This aim study effect low-fat , high omega-3 diet serum tissue biomarkers patient prostatectomy prostate cancer . Ultimately , hope identify validate intermediate marker efficacy large-scale dietary prevention trial . 2 . To establish validate insulin growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) insulin growth factor bind protein ( IGFBP ) relevant intermediate biomarkers prostate cancer prevention trial . IGF-1 peptide growth factor important growth progression prostate cancer . To knowledge , prospective dietary intervention study evaluate effect low-fat diet omega-3 fatty acid supplement IGF-1 IGFBPs , potential serve relevant intermediate marker low-fat dietary intervention trial prostate cancer prevention . 3 . To establish validate serum tissue fatty acid relevant intermediate biomarkers prostate cancer prevention trial . We evaluate men randomize low-fat , fish-oil-supplemented diet increase serum ratio omega-3 : omega-6 fatty acid compare men randomize control Western diet radical prostatectomy . We also study patient low-fat , fish oil arm increase ratio membrane omega-3 : omega-6 fatty acid well decrease COX-2 decrease PGE-2 level benign malignant tissue visceral fat . If , prove evidence support potential low-fat fish oil diet prostate cancer prevention . If serum omega-3 : omega-6 ratio correlate change COX-2 PGE-2 tissue , serum omea-3 : omega-6 ratio may useful monitoring activity efficacy low-fat fish-oil-supplemented diet future trial .</detailed_description>
