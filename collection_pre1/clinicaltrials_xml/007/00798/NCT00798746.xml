	<brief_summary>The purpose current study assess role pyloric drainage procedure alter reflux effect quality life patient underwent esophagectomy . Researchers hypothesize patient underwent minimally invasive esophagectomies without pyloric drainage experience less reflux symptom therefore better quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality Life After Esophagectomy Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery consider curative patient esophageal cancer . The minimally invasive approach develop laparoscopy thoracoscopy replace large abdominal thoracic incision . For open minimally invasive procedure , patient many adjustment overcome order regain quality life within norm . In recent study health-related quality life ( HRQL ) curative surgical resection , symptom reflux variable worsened statistical significance . The study plan retrospectively compare two group patient : underwent esophagectomy pyloric drainage procedure . The study do use MD Anderson patient underwent minimally invasive esophagectomies , pyloroplasty pyloromyotomy standard procedure . Clinically relevant data demographic information collect retrospectively two group include age , gender , Body Mass Index , level anastomosis , time elapse since surgery . All patient interview via telephone . At least two attempt make contact patient .</detailed_description>
