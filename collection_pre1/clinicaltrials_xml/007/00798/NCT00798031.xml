If subject dental insurance cost surgeon may cover insurance . Potential subject check insurance carrier regard coverage prior agree participate research study . Any insurance co-payments require cost subject . Methods Materials This open , prospective case-series clinical documentation study document clinical efficacy 4.0mm diameter x 6 mm length implant ( Astra Tech Dental Implant , Fixture OsseospeedTM ) treatment subject miss teeth posterior maxilla ( referred Kennedy class I class II situation ) . A minimum two preferably three implant shall consider surgical site . A total 20 subject fulfil inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion enrol . Bilateral posterior maxilla treatment provide ( 2-3 implant pre-side ) side must follow inclusion/exclusion criterion . The study five-year follow study 15 clinic visit . Interim analyse perform 6 month 1 3 year load temporary prosthesis . The study comprise follow three period : Pre-surgical evaluation planning ( 0 week implant surgery ) Surgical prosthetic treatment ( Surgery 52 weeks/12 month ) Follow-up ( 12 month 60 month ) The screening procedure include clinical radiographic assessment . Pre-existing radiograph ( e.g . panoramic intraoral periapical image ) use must older 6 month . A minimum 5 mm height ( alveolar ridge sinus floor ) require . Diagnostic step involve fabrication surgical guide surgical denture indicate optimal position implant placement posterior upper jaw base available bone . Preliminary diagnostic impression make ( Penta , 3M ESPE ) pour dental stone ( Whip Mix Corp. , Louisville , KY ) . Implant subject may pre-operative Cone Bean CT image study make College Dentistry 's Department Oral Maxillofacial Radiology discretion Principal Investigator follow diagnostic work-up . Subjects shall either patient record College Dentistry shall enrol new College . Patient record electronic along paper version . Paper-based Case Report Forms ( CRF ) contain subject 's medical information keep one central file lock cabinet Dental Clinical Research Center . This data keep secure file accessible PI Clinical Coordinator . Surgical prosthetic treatment ( Surgery 52 weeks/12 month ) Surgical Intervention : All surgical procedure perform outpatient procedure College Dentistry Department Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Department Periodontics . Implant placement follow one-stage procedure perform local anesthesia . Prophylactic antibiotic treatment give . One hour prior surgery patient receive first dose 7 - 10 day prophylactic antibiotic treatment regimen base Amoxicillin ( 500mg TID 7 day ) allergic Amoxicillin , Clindamycin ( 300 mg QID 7 day ) . Details treatment record clinical case report form ( CRF ) . Other medication , consider necessary patient 's welfare , may give discretion investigator ( ) . The administration medication record patient 's note per normal practice . In addition , medication may negative effect bone tissue well medication treat Adverse Event consider probably possibly treatment-related must also record appropriate section Case Report Form ( CRF ) . Intravenous conscious sedation allow . Conscious out-patient sedation `` titrated effect '' follow medication . The dosage vary depend upon subject 's age , weight medical status . Versed ( 1 10 mg. ) Valium ( 1 20 mg. ) , titrate duration procedure Fentanyl ( 0.025 0.1 mg ) Demerol ( 25 100 mg ) , titrate duration procedure . Phenergan ( 5 25 mg ) may add either narcotics potentate effect extend work time . At discretion surgeon , oral sedation use alternative ( e.g. , Valium 5-20mg ) . Following achievement sedation , infiltration local dental anesthetic perform [ 2 % Lidocaine HCL 1:100,000 epinephrine 4 % Atricaine Epi 1:100,000 ] immediately prior surgery . Alternatively , long act local anesthetic [ 0.5 % bupivicaine + 1:200,000 epinephrine ] may use . In general , subject treatment plan minimum two implant space 7 mm apart ( center-to-center ) anatomic region provide sufficient alveolar width minimum 1 mm bone dimension ( minimum 6 mm ridge width ) . The objective place two three implant upper posterior jaw . Implants position typically anterior residual ridge ( nasal floor maxillary sinus 5 mm great cortical trabecular bone ) occasionally distal wall maxillary sinus . Extensive autogenous bone graft and/or sinus lift graft perform trial . In case bilateral edentulism minimum two implant place location . Besides optimal bone support , provide primary stability , direction/inclination implant mesiodistal buccolingual dimension shall govern requirement satisfactory final prosthetic function esthetic . Lack Primary Stability : If implant achieve primary stability , two stage delay loading period 3 month perform implant place subject . Use osteotome : Localized internal sinus floor elevation simultaneous implant placement use osteotome technique allow protocol . Cases sinus perforation subject standard care treatment per investigator discretion treatment detail subsequently record Case Report From . The surgeon aim full bone coverage implant thread . Where thread expose , augmentation autogenous bone alone combination Bio-Gide Bilayer Membrane use . Immediately implant placement ( IP ) abutment connection intraoral radiograph fixture make primary stability assess clinically Resonance Frequency Analysis use OsstellTM device . The Osstell device FDA approve hand hold resonance frequency transducer measure relative bone stiffness around dental implant . The device consist transducer connect implant implant abutment transducer apply small harmonic steady state sweep waveform second transducer detects stiffness implant surround bone . The basis transducer set cantilever beam ( principal tune fork ) first flexural resonance measure . The value response compute presented scale 1-100 Implant Stability Quotient ( ISQ ) value . Implants subject 6-week healing period leave transmucosal position peri-implant mucosa suture closely adapted abutment . Subjects wear pre-existing removable partial denture implant sit initial 6 week healing period . Assessments implant stability evaluate 6 week follow placement ( Temporary Restoration stage `` TR '' ) , TR +4 , 8,12 , 26 52 week respectively . In case primary implant stability achieve patient treat conventional two-stage approach ( i.e . submerge heal combination extend healing period 3 month uncover load implant ) . Such patient exclude study follow full course study . During heal period , patient recall 2 , 4 6 week follow placement . To avoid overload implant , patient allow wear removable prosthesis implant period . TREATMENT OF FAILING IMPLANTS If implant lose ( fails ) , define , site shall treat manner best suit well subject . Following implant removal treatment site , implant may replace another implant site may allow heal future placement another implant site may allow heal without implant replacement . No replacement implant shall enter study . Any implant showing excessive bone loss ( grater 5mm ) , radiolucency infection , shall treat manner best suit well-being patient , include treatment save implant . Treatment may include surgical intervention resolve infection and/or sequestra may include administration topical systemic antibiotic . Such event treatment shall record Adverse Event form . Implants successfully treat shall consider treatment failure study . Follow-up ( 12 month 60 month ) The patient return follow-up visit TR +24 , 36 , 48 60 month . At follow-up visit evaluation soft tissue status treatment relate complication perform together intraoral radiograph implant . Radiographic assessments/measurements Intraoral periapical radiograph implant take immediately implant placement , impression temporary restoration , visit 7 , visit 8 visit 9 ( 12 , 26 respectively 52 week implant placement ) follow-up visit 24 , 36 , 48 60 month . The following variable record : - periimplant radiolucency record presence absence radiolucency . - marginal bone level record vertical distance reference point marginal bone level . The distance measure near 1/10 mm . PRIMARY OUTCOMES MEASURES The primary outcome measure case series evaluation shall implant loss ( removal ) . SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE Mobility : A free-standing implant immobile test instrument pressure . Mobility shall quantify . Instead , mobility detectable application pressure two oppose instrument implant shall consider indication failure . Stability : Implant resonance frequency analysis measure `` Implant Stability Quotient '' ( ISQ ) scale 1-100 record . Radiolucency : A standard conventional dental radiograph show evidence continuous peri-implant radiolucency . Pain , Infection : A successfully integrated implant characterize absence persistent irreversible sign symptom pain infection . Bone height : Vertical bone loss le 0.2mm annually follow first year loading . Patient Adaptation : Patients satisfied esthetic , phonetics function implant support crown .</detailed_description>
