	<brief_summary>Vaccination principal mean combat epidemic pandemic influenza . As vaccine induce relatively strain-specific short-lived antibody response , annual immunisation regularly updated vaccine recommend seasonal influenza , would expect protect pandemic event . In clinical trial among young adult , least two dos avian influenza H5 H9 subunit vaccine need induce moderate antibody response . However , study include old subject unexpectedly find people age 65 yrs pre-vaccination neutralise antibody influenza H5 H9 respectively . These subject mount robust antibody response single dose H5 H9 pandemic vaccine , suggest effectively prim least strain avian influenza . This exploratory proposal focus elderly subject whose immune system already exhibit antibody H5 goal investigate humoral cellular basis immune response seasonal pandemic vaccination . We examine neutralise antibody response range human non-human influenza virus seasonal pandemic vaccination evaluate cellular B T cell immune response pandemic H5 vaccination</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES : Immunological objective - To evaluate heterosubtypic neutralise antibody influenza virus older people - To evaluate heterosubtypic neutralise antibody response human non-human influenza virus follow seasonal influenza vaccine - To evaluate homologous heterosubtypic neutralise antibody response human non-human influenza viruses MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine ; - To evaluate cellular B T cell response influenza H5 non-exposed subject exhibit anti-H5 neutralising antibody seasonal ( TIV ) pandemic H5 vaccination - To identify epitope influenza haemagglutinin anti-H5 neutralising antibody sera non-exposed subject direct Safety Objectives - To evaluate safety one two IM dose MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 ( H5N1 ) influenza vaccine , contain 7.5 μg H5 antigen adult subject - To evaluate safety one IM dose seasonal influenza vaccine , contain 15 μg H1 , H3 B antigen adult subject Hypotheses : - Heterosubtypic cross react antibody influenza exist elderly subject boost single dose ( ) seasonal TIV ( b ) pandemic influenza vaccination - Heterosubtypic cross react antibody influenza exist young subject induce ( ) seasonal TIV ( b ) pandemic influenza vaccination</detailed_description>
