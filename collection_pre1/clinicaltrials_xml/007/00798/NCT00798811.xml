	<brief_title>High-dose Chemotherapy With Autologous Stem Cell Rescue Pediatric High-risk Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although significant progress make treatment brain tumor , prognosis remain dismal patient relapse tumor . The outlook infant young child also poor , primarily limit use radiotherapy , although recent report suggest vigorous combination chemotherapy alone improve survival young child without macroscopic metastasis diagnosis . The prognosis also satisfactory large residual tumor remain surgery leptomeningeal seed present diagnosis . Given situation , plan explore possible efficacy high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell rescue patient high-risk embryonal tumor , relapse brain tumor infant young child brain tumors.High-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell rescue improve survival child high-risk solid tumor . treatment strategy base hypothesis dose escalation might improve survival child high-risk solid tumors.Many investigator demonstrate dose escalation use sequential high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell rescue might result additional improvement survival patient high-risk tumor . As embryonal brain tumor chemosensitive tumor , strategy use high-dose chemotherapy might effective treatment high-risk embryonal brain tumor relapse brain tumor . In addition , might defer eliminate irradiation infant young child brain tumor</detailed_description>
