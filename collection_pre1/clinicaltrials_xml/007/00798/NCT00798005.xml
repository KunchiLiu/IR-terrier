	<brief_summary>Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease ( PAOD ) condition cause ischemia leg due atherosclerotic disease affect large artery legs . Chronic PAOD regard marker generalize atherosclerosis . PAOD threaten survival extremity often cause lifelong disablement painful leg . The clinical consequence PAOD include pain walking ( claudication ) , pain rest loss tissue integrity distal limbs.A variety medical therapy investigate patient PAOD . There currently evidence suggest medical therapy effective patient rest pain and/or ischemic ulcer . Also , use intramuscular angiogenic VEGF-A gene transfer recently demonstrate improvement clinical hemodynamic status patient severe PAOD</brief_summary>
