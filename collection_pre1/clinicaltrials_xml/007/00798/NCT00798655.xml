	<brief_summary>The objective study follow : - Primary : - To evaluate progression-free survival locoregionally advance ( stage III/IV ) SCCHN patient undergo postoperative chemoradiotherapy panitumumab . - Secondary : - To evaluate overall survival , event-free survival , toxicity . - To correlate efficacy parameter 1 ) EGFR downstream pathway activation , 2 ) FcyR polymorphism , 3 ) serum cytokine profile . More specifically , aim demonstrate usefulness biomarkers ( downstream signal molecule , FcyR polymorphism , tumor serum cytokine ( ) predict progression-free survival patient SCCHN treat treatment . Specific biomarkers relate Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor angiogenesis , include EGFR , pEGFR , Src , pMAPK , pSTAT3 , pSTAT5 , pSTAT1 , pAKT , p38 , p21 , p27 , PARP , E-cadherin , p-ErbB3 , Ki67 , VEGF , IL-8 , use reverse phase protein microarrays ( RPPA ) test baseline archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissue . To collect tumor tissue pretreatment biopsy cytokine/chemokine immune biomarker study tumor tissue . We plan investigate expression pAKT , pMAPK , EGFR pathway-related marker well angiogenesis biomarkers . In addition , EGFR polymorphisms study tumor tissue sample serum . Additional study may perform future . Some study may perform Amgen .</brief_summary>
