	<brief_summary>This trial use type radiotherapy call intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) , able deliver radiation prostate deliver less dose surround normal organ compare standard 3D conformal radiotherapy presently use BCCA . This trial use RapidArc IMRT , new way deliver IMRT , radiation dose deliver single rotation radiotherapy machine around patient . This new method deliver IMRT show least good conventional IMRT deliver dose , take less time . The aim study deliver high radiation dose prostate gland standard treatment increase dose normal organ . In way , hop likelihood cancer come back reduce without cause increase side-effects .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically prove adenocarcinoma prostate . 2 . Registration must occur within 26 week biopsy . 3 . History physical examination ( include digital rectal examination ( DRE ) ) within 8 week prior registration . 4 . Patients must intermediate risk prostate cancer , define : PSA ≤ 20 ng/ml , Gleason ≤ 7 , Stage ≤ T2c , Do meet criterion lowrisk prostate cancer ( Lowrisk = All : PSA ≤ 10 + Gleason ≤ 6 + stage ≤ T2b ) 5 . Patients must follow blood test within two week registration : Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) , testosterone ( TTT ) , complete blood count ( CBC ) , electrolytes , creatinine . Patients value one test ( include PSA ) fall outside normal range need review oncologist determine eligibility study . 6 . Patients must estimate life expectancy least 10 year . 7 . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 . 8 . Patients must contraindications high dose pelvic irradiation . 9 . Patients must receive prior radiation therapy pelvis . 10 . Patients must history inflammatory bowel disease . 11 . Patients must receive prior hormonal therapy chemotherapy . 12 . Patients must hormonal therapy plan part therapeutic intervention . 13 . Patients must contraindication MRI scan . 14 . Patients artificial hip 15 . Patients body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 32 .
