	<brief_summary>Intermittent Claudication ( IC ) common condition characterise pain muscle legs exertion cause `` hardening artery '' reduce blood supply . The investigator know vast majority people suffer condition remain stable deteriorate , thus general viability leg risk . The main aim treatment , therefore , try improve walk thus reduce impact problem patient life style . There many method management intermittent claudication , investigator know produce best result . This study aim compare short medium term outcome exercise programme , percutaneous transluminal angioplasty combination two treatment patient intermittent claudication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Nonsurgical Treatment Intermittent Claudication Due Femoro-popliteal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intermittent claudication ( IC ) common problem UK 's elderly population prevalence 5 -10 % . Intermittent claudication infers significant quality life limitation , however , disease generally run benign course &gt; 80 % patient remain stable . Yet annual mortality rate claudicants approach 5 % , three time age sex match population , due high prevalence co-morbidity . IC under-recognised risk factor coronary cerebrovascular event . Sixty percent claudicants die coronary heart disease 10 % die stroke . Treating patient claudication , therefore , likely pay high dividend term reduce death myocardial infarction stroke . The appropriate management IC , therefore remain topic debate potentially beneficial therapy include : supervised exercise programme ( SEP ) ; &amp; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) . A recent Cochrane review PTA versus non-surgical management intermittent claudication highlight two appropriate study . More recently result randomize control trial Sweden publish . This emphasize dearth reliable scientific data area . It believe aorta-iliac atherosclerosis often solitary disease oppose femoro-popliteal disease often manifestation generalize atherosclerosis . Further , 5-year PTA patency rate aorta-iliac disease much good femoro-popliteal PTA . Therefore , PTA well-established treatment modality aorta-iliac disease role femoro-popliteal disease debatable11 . This trial aim prove effective treatment modality claudication due femoro-popliteal disease . The two treatment modality question work different mechanism . PTA increase blood flow limb . Whereas , exercise work combination factor include optimized structural metabolic performance skeletal muscle , improvement rheological parameter , development collateral , improve walking technique mark psychological benefit . Still efficacy treatment modality claudication judge improvement standard measure low limb ischaemia suggest International Society Cardiovascular Surgery ( ISCVS ) . These essentially segmental pressure measurement walk distance . The primary aim treatment patient peripheral vascular disease improve quality life ( QoL ) rather prolong survival . Several study show traditional measure low limb ischaemia bear little correlation patient 's QoL therefore need assess independently . Further , generic QoL measure sensitive enough detect minor change QoL disease-specific measure need include outcome . Evidence accumulate episode exercise onset claudication pain follow rest may consider low-grade ischaemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI ) . Repeated episode IRI may cumulative effect lead vascular endothelial damage progression atherosclerosis . This may explain excess cardiovascular mortality see patients16 . Most experimental work measure biochemical marker IRI do follow episode acute exercise . Few study show effect exercise -training programme biochemical marker IRI . We intend investigate secondary component trial . Heat shock protein ( hsp ) ubiquitous protein find cell organism . They mainly classify accord molecular weight . In addition constitutively express heat shock protein induce number stressor include heat , ischaemia oxidative stress . Members hsp70 family extensively study group stress protein implicate prevention ischaemia-reperfusion induced apoptosis , necrosis oxidative injury variety cell type include cardiac myocyte18 . Studies show hsp antibody serum normal individual . Anti-hsp70 antibody level serum show high vascular patient ( IC , critical ischaemia aortic aneurysm ) . Heat shock protein detect atherosclerotic lesion high concentration . It postulate hsp play key role autoimmune pathogenesis atherosclerosis . Levels anti-hsp antibody elevate patient carotid coronary atherosclerosis correlate degree atherosclerosis . Measuring anti-hsp antibody patient IC undergoing exercise period time may provide valuable evidence role heat shock protein atherosclerosis . The secondary outcome measure cost effectiveness analysis interest health planner clinicians health service limit resource 'value money ' become increasingly important .</detailed_description>
