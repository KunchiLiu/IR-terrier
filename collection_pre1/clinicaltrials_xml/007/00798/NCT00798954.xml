	<brief_summary>The use DES diminish need improve treatment strategy , especially treatment bifurcation lesion still leave much clarify . Particularly , bifurcation lesion stenting main branch could result obstruction vital side branch , many report use 2 drug-eluting stent . Resulting less favorable , target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) rate , 10-15 % main branch 11-40 % side branch . In Japan , PERFECT multi-center registry evaluate outcome single stenting plus kiss balloon technique Directional Coronary Atherectomy ( DCA ) removal tissue plaque . TLR rate main branch side branch satisfactory 1.3 % . However , DCA technique mainly suitable proximal coronary artery lesion , take skilled operator . For treatment relatively distal bifurcation lesion , first POBA perform , lesion stented , follow kiss balloon technique fully expand side branch , consider viable treatment . The Toyohashi Heart Center outcomes August 2004 single stent kiss ballooning technique , use sirolimus-eluting stent bifurcation lesion , achieve satisfactory 5.2 % TLR main side branch , suggest use two stent may necessarily ideal treatment . The paclitaxel-eluting stent expect become available Japan June 2007 . This stent 's cell expand maximum 3.5mm , provide large lumen access side-branch treatment . As , develop study compare outcomes paclitaxel-eluting sirolimus-eluting stent bifurcation lesion require side branch dilatation use kiss ballooning technique .</brief_summary>
