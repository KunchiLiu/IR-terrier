	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Pemetrexed may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving pemetrexed together carboplatin bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give pemetrexed together carboplatin bevacizumab work first-line therapy treat old patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed , Carboplatin , Bevacizumab First-Line Therapy Treating Older Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate progression-free survival 6 month elderly patient advance nonsquamous cell non-small cell lung cancer treat pemetrexed disodium , carboplatin , bevacizumab first-line therapy . Secondary - To assess adverse event profile safety regimen patient . - To estimate confirmed antitumor response rate , define RECIST criterion , overall survival patient . - To compare quality life ( QOL ) patient treat regimen vs QOL young patient . - To correlate QOL toxicity , define NCI CTCAE v3.0 criterion . Tertiary - To evaluate polymorphism gene encode protein involve cellular transport , activation , cytotoxic activity pemetrexed disodium evaluate relationship treatment toxicity/efficacy patient QOL . - To evaluate polymorphisms gene involve blood pressure regulation relationship susceptibility hypertension induce anti-VEGF therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute , carboplatin IV 30 minute , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease partial complete response 6 course may continue receive pemetrexed disodium bevacizumab every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tissue blood sample collect baseline pharmacogenetic analysis . Blood sample use evaluate functionally relevant polymorphism gene encode protein involve transport activation pemetrexed disodium gene encode protein involve susceptibility hypertension induce bevacizumab . Tissue sample use evaluate expression polymorphism pemetrexed disodium target gene ( TS , DHFR , GARFT ) . Quality life assess baseline periodically study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
