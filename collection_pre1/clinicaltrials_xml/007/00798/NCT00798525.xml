	<brief_title>Argatroban Versus Lepirudin Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critically ill patient increase risk develop deep vein thrombosis due immobilisation and/or underlying disease . Usually , heparin use anticoagulation patient . However , serious complication heparin therapy heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II ( HIT ) . HIT immune-mediated syndrome cause antibody direct heparin-PF4-complex , bind platelet via Fc part , thereby activate platelet cause aggregation hypercoagulability . Thus , HIT risk thrombosis organ damage paradoxically even increase heparin administration . HIT associate significant morbidity mortality unrecognized . Therefore , patient , develop thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis heparin therapy suspicious HIT receive alternative anticoagulants2 . The direct thrombin inhibitor lepirudin ( Refludan® ) equally effective heparin prevention deep vein thrombosis lung embolism3 . The elimination half life lepirudin average 60 min , renal failure may increase 48 hour . Critically ill patient often develop acute renal failure require continuous renal replacement therapy . Thus , lepirudin use patient , intensive dose adjustment necessary avoid accumulation severe bleeding . In contrast , effective anticoagulation need prevent clot formation within extracorporeal circuit , clot substantially increase patients´ risk cost therapy . Argatroban ( Argatra® ) , another direct thrombin inhibitor , recently show safe effective prevention deep vein thrombosis patient HIT . Interestingly , argatroban eliminate hepatic metabolism . Therefore , initial dose adjustment necessary patient renal failure . Preliminary report document feasibility argatroban anticoagulation haemodialysis . Observational data patient undergo continuous haemodialysis suggest life time filter argatroban anticoagulation limit due clot formation . Thus , argatroban would safer effective lepirudin critically ill patient require continuous renal replacement therapy . Therefore , propose prospective randomize double-blinded trial test hypotheses argatroban significantly increase efficacy safety renal replacement therapy measure life time haemodialysis filter compare lepirudin</detailed_description>
