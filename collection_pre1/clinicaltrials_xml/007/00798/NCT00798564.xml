	<brief_summary>The overall aim explore pathophysiological factor relate airway hyperresponsiveness direct indirect provocation stimulus athletes different sport activity , special focus epithelial reaction link CC16 eicosanoid relate inflammatory response . The investigator also wish compare indirect test do hyper osmotic challenge Mannitol compare define sport specific exercise challenge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Induced Asthma Airway Reactivity Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By non-invasive tool investigator wish characterize type airway reaction various provocative stimulus athletes two different sort activity , Tennis swim . As control use sedentary age-matched control region , expose school environment . Thus wish : - explore prevalence positive mannitol reactivity among swimmer tennis player relates symptom , disease history sport specific exercise provocation test . - compare result sport specific test standardized eucapnic hyperventilation test ( EHV ) - compare overall reactivity mannitol EHV among swimmer tennis player compare aged match control . - explore role CC16 airway reactivity different provocative stimulus see whether difference different sport activity , different test protocol athletes control . - explore evidence eicosanoid relate inflammatory reaction athlete control relation different provocative stimulus The study population consist 100 elite swimmer , 100 elite tennis player 100 non-elite , eged match control . In latter group , 30 age match non-atopic non-asthmatic control .</detailed_description>
