	<brief_summary>The general objective elucidate mechanism whereby sex hormone may modulate severity respiratory disease . An important component proposal systematic intensive approach characterize cellular cytokine component airway inflammation respond fluctuation sex hormone level . The effect menstrual fluctuation level sex hormone inflammation bacterial load respiratory secretion CF patient also determine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Most CF patient die chronic lung infection Ps aer , chronic inflammation progressive airway damage . Agents reduce inflammation enhance airway antibacterial defence hold potential therapeutic value . Therefore , considerable current interest identify stimulate activity agent . Although sex hormone generally acknowledge modulate respiratory inflammation , downstream mechanism action remain incompletely understood . We identify three AMPs , responsive sex hormone CF human respiratory tract , include one ( LTF ) know activity Ps aer biofilm formation . Our preliminary result show additive activity LTF STH Ps aer biofilm formation , LTF STH also inhibit attachment Ps aer airway epithelial cell . Taken together , finding consistent concept female sex hormone exert negative effect CF lung , part , reduce level AMPs airway . The next step determine female sex hormone alter airway inflammation infection AMP level respiratory secretion CF patient . Confirmation current hypothesis position u future test capacity progesterone estrogen antagonist , androgen agonist three specific AMPs , inhibit inflammation / infection available animal model CF .</detailed_description>
