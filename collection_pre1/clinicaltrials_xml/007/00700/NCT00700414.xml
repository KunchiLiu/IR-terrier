	<brief_summary>This study aim collect demographic medical information include detailed family history cancer child adolescents adrenocortical tumor order learn clinical epidemiological aspect , treatment modality , outcome patient rare disease , worldwide . In addition , investigator St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) plan perform molecular study tumor cell aim clarify role TP53 gene genetic pathway tumor . They aim obtain relevant biological material participant adrenocortical tumor ( ACT ) , biological parent , relatives determination TP53 germline status , molecular study TP53 gene , molecular pathway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Pediatric Adrenocortical Tumor Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adrenocortical tumor ( ACT ) rare cancer type form out layer adrenal gland uncommon child teenager . There variation pediatric ACT incidence worldwide . In United States , 25 new case ACT per million per year , make rare tumor . However , southern Brazil , annual incidence ACT 15 time see United States account 3.4-4.2 per million per year . Molecular study reveal majority child ACT , particularly young 4 year age , constitutional TP53 mutation and/or imprint defect chromosome 11p observed Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome ( BWS ) patient . Some mutation , exemplify R337H TP53 germline mutation , function mutant protein relatively preserve , history cancer carrier family relatively unremarkable . In case , TP53 mutate gene encodes functionally-impaired protein predict pervasive history familial cancer ( Li-Fraumeni syndrome ) . Therefore , observation implication genetic counseling family childhood ACT underscore importance genotype-phenotype correlation familial cancer syndrome . The creation rare tumor registry provide mechanism collect information gather single institution . The analysis registry data would permit overview clinical , epidemiological , current treatment standard , survival data patient thus create opportunity research . It also may facilitate development treatment consensus among investigator register patient help design future study . Moreover , combine Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) IPACTR study expect provide meaningful insight biology ACT , include clinical phenotype/genotype relationship , treatment outcome long-term follow-up data subject rare tumor . Finally , would provide data long-term consequence exposure tumor-secreted androgen ( find 80 % pediatric case ) child 's growth development .</detailed_description>
