	<brief_summary>Cancer cell make protein call antigen act marker tumor cell . These antigen cause cancer . Special white blood cell , call T cell T lymphocytes , recognize respond antigen . In many disease , cell immune system help body get rid disease . However , T cell normally rest , need protein diseased cell surface begin work . Unfortunately , cancer cell usually make protein T cell need work . Therefore , T cell normally work cancer cell . We think one reason cancer grow reject body first place . Another white blood cell , call dendritic cell , special protein need make T cell work destroy cancer cell . However , dendritic cell normally cancer proteins surface . The challenge combine cancer marker ( antigen ) dendritic cell make vaccine . We think body 's T cell might react tumor help destroy . This study see put tumor antigen make lab onto dendritic cell make T cell work tumor cell . We want answer question inject dendritic cell load antigen . Then check response base lab study clinical course . We compare response melanoma response common antigen , almost everyone already expose . Flu , example , common antigen people expose . We also need test response antigen body likely see . For example , plan use KLH ( keyhole limpet hemocyanin ) , pigment color protein make sea creature know keyhole limpet . Each , flu KLH antigen , harmless , use along dendritic cell-tumor vaccine . This help u find vaccine working , base lab study check vaccination .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis metastatic melanoma , AJCC stage III IV , histologic confirmation Dept . Pathology MSKCC . Patients must HLAA*0201 positive . Expected survival great 3 month . Karnofsky performance status 70 well . Patients may receive chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiation within approximately 4 week ( approximately 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin ) participation protocol . Patients receive immune modify pharmacologics ( e.g. , interferon ) approximately 24 week enrollment . Pregnant ( clinically document positive pregnancy test within approximately 2 wks study entry ) lactate woman , immunization include differentiation antigen share melanoma tumor melanocyte , immune response differentiation antigen could unknown developmental sequela fetus infant . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal woman , postmenopausal status patient report document accordingly . Patients require systemic corticosteroid comparable exogenous immunosuppressive agent ( ) ( exclusion use NSAIDs ) Patients know immunodeficiency ( e.g. , infection HTLV1,2 , HIV1,2 ; etc . ) T cell defect would alter response investigator ' ability ass outcomes accurately . Patients preexist retinal choroidal eye disease . Patients coexist autoimmune disease , except vitiligo . Patients significantly impaired hematologic , hepatic , renal function , e.g. , ANC &lt; 1000 , hgb &lt; 8.0 g/dl , plts &lt; 50,000/ul , AST &gt; 3x ULN , creatinine &gt; 2.0 Cl creat &lt; 30ml/min , assess within approximately two week study entry . Patients serious coexist medical illness . Patients organ allograft . Patients s/p splenectomy s/p splenic irradiation . Patients active brain metastasis . Patients organic brain syndrome psychologic impairment would preclude participation compliance protocol .</criteria>
