	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize , addition apoptotic effect , clofarabine induces DNA hypomethylation . If investigator ' hypothesis correct , finding present proposal contribute information relate mechanisms action clofarabine also provide opportunity combine epigenetic target MDS use clofarabine either another hypomethylating agent histone deacetylase inhibitor . Clofarabine demonstrate anti-cancer activity inhibition DNA synthesis repair , induction apoptosis , possibly mechanism . Numerous response observe treatment clofarabine heavily pre-treated relapsed/refractory patient ALL , AML high risk MDS . In present proposal , investigator study clinical laboratory effect 2 different dosage clofarabine patient fail hypomethylating agent , 5-azacytidine . This study recruit patient receive least six cycle 5-azacytidine without response whose disease progress relapsed 5-azacytidine . The first cohort patient receive clofarabine 10 mg/m2/day five day second cohort patient 5 mg/m2/day five day , every four six week . The investigator determine frequency response two dosage nucleoside analog group patient . Measurement response include improvement peripheral blood count , reduction blood platelet transfusion need eradication cytogenetically abnormal clone . Successful completion study define position clofarabine MDS era epigenetic targeting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Overview This study recruit patient receive least six cycle 5-azacytidine without response whose disease progress relapsed 5-azacytidine . The first cohort patient receive clofarabine 10 mg/m2/day five day second cohort patient 5 mg/m2/day five day , every four six week . The investigator determine frequency response two dosage nucleoside analog group patient . Measurement response include improvement peripheral blood count , reduction blood platelet transfusion need eradication cytogenetically abnormal clone . - Primary Objectives 1 . To determine frequency duration peripheral blood response IV clofarabine MDS patient fail 5-azacytidine 2 . To determine frequency duration bone marrow responses IV clofarabine , include CR + PR - Secondary Objectives To determine whether clofarabine exhibit DNA hypomethylating property</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients MDS risk group , immediately prior enter study , already receive least six cycle 5azacytidine fail , either due response disease relapse despite still 5azacytidine , patient whose MDS progress 5azacytidine , irrespective number cycle patient receive . We specifically choose stringent patient population order address question whether clofarabine use salvage patient fail 5azacytidine small patient population , i.e . 10 patient cohort . ECOG Performance status 0 2 Recombinant erythropoietin allow , patient already receive erythropoietin . GCSF give neutropenic stage follow therapy since would affect evaluation response response make base CBC bone marrow change upon recovery clofarabine . Patients must least four week last course 5azacytidine Age 18 year Have adequate renal hepatic function indicate follow laboratory value : Serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL ; serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL , estimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) must 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculate Modification Diet Renal Disease equation Predicted GFR ( ml/min/1.73 m2 ) = 186 x ( Serum Creatinine ) 1.154 x ( age year ) 0.023 x ( 0.742 patient female ) x ( 1.212 patient black ) Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL × upper limit normal ( ULN ) Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) /alanine transaminase ( ALT ) 2.5 × ULN Alkaline phosphatase 2.5 × ULN Capable understand investigational nature , potential risk benefit study , able provide sign informed consent . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week prior enrollment . Male female patient must use effective contraceptive method study minimum 6 month study treatment . Nursing pregnant woman Prior clofarabine therapy Life expectancy le 3 month due intercurrent illness . Current concomitant chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy specify protocol . Use investigational agent within 30 day anticancer therapy within 4 week study entry exception hydroxyurea . The patient must recover acute toxicity previous therapy . Have severe concurrent disease , history serious organ dysfunction disease involve heart , kidney , liver , organ system may place patient undue risk undergo treatment . Patients systemic fungal , bacterial , viral , infection control ( define exhibit ongoing signs/symptoms related infection without improvement , despite appropriate antibiotic treatment ) . Any significant concurrent disease , illness , psychiatric disorder would compromise patient safety compliance , interfere consent , study participation , follow , interpretation study result .</criteria>
