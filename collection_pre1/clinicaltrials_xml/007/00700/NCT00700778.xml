	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming . The use recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin may prevent breast cancer premenopausal woman BRCA1 mutation . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin prevent breast cancer premenopausal woman BRCA1 mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Preventing Breast Cancer Premenopausal Women With BRCA1 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine whether genomic profile breast epithelial cell high-breast cancer-risk woman , define positive BRCA1 status nulliparous condition , express signature indicative high-risk . Secondary - Determine whether woman identify express `` high-breast cancer-risk '' signature revert `` low-risk '' signature 90-day treatment r-hCG , induce breast differentiation genomic change would serve biomarkers indicative decrease breast cancer risk . OUTLINE : Patients receive recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin subcutaneously three time weekly . Treatment continue weekly 90 day absence unacceptable toxicity . Benign breast tissue specimen collect core needle biopsy baseline , day 90 , day 270 . Tissue sample analyze cytopathology epithelial normality , Ki67 immunohistochemical staining cell proliferation , cDNA microarray gene expression , serum study hormone level biomarker determination . After completion study treatment , patient follow 24 week .</detailed_description>
