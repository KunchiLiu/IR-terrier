	<detailed_description>After initial screen visit ( Visit 1 ) follow one-week period monitor usual medium habit , subject baseline functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan ( Visit 2 ) . They assign 3:1 ratio either one-week violent video game play 1-2 hour per day video game play one week . Subjects receive second fMRI scan end week ( Visit 3 ) . Subjects played violent video game assign one three condition ( continue regular violent video game play , video game play , intervention involve cognitive training work memory ) one week , order investigate persistence change find first week exposure . Subjects played video game first week continue play video game second week . Following week , subject receive third fMRI scan ( Visit 4 ) . One week third fMRI scan , subject final visit phone call check possibility issue aggressive thoughts/feelings/behavior follow video game exposure study ( Visit 5 ) . Brain functioning measure use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) primary measurement methodology , neuropsychological testing use secondary measurement methodology .</detailed_description>
