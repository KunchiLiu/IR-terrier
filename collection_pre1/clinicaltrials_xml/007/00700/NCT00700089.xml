	<brief_title>AID-trial Assertive Intervention After Deliberate Self-harm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS/HYPOTHESES The aim study investigate assertive outreach incorporate hands-on guidance motivational support compliance follow-up treatment suicide attempt able reduce frequency non-fatal fatal suicide act . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Suicidal behavior associate considerable risk subsequent self-harm , include complete suicide . Owens et al . ( Owens , Horrocks , &amp; House 2002a ) conduct systematic review fatal non-fatal repetition self-harm . Owens find median one-year repetition rate 16 percent non-fatal two percent fatal . Results epidemiological European Multicentre Study ( WHO/EURO ) also show repetition rate 12 30 percent within first year , make suicide attempt important high-risk factor ( Cedereke , Monti , &amp; Ojehagen 2002 ; Schmidtke et al . 1996 ) . Unfortunately still randomize control trial evidence base recommendation suicide prevention . The study conduct often flaw due selection bias lack statistical power ( Crawford et al . 2007 ; Hawton et al . 1998b ; van der et al . 1997 ) . A systematic review randomise clinical trial psychosocial pharmacological intervention person attempt suicide reveal , intervention proven effective reduce suicide rate repetition rate ( Hawton et al . 1999 ) . The author identify non-significant trend toward reduced repetition deliberate self-harm problem-solving therapy compare standard aftercare , provision emergency contact card addition standard care compare standard aftercare alone , intensive aftercare plus outreach compare standard aftercare . In one relatively large study group , evaluate community follow-up patient attend outpatient appointment , near significant difference repetition deliberate self-harm 10.7 percent compare 17.4 percent ( 0.57 ; 0.32 1.02 ) , ( Van Heeringen et al . 1995 ) . Hawton et al . conclude result systematic review indicate currently insufficient evidence base firm recommendation effective form treatment patient recently deliberately harm . Given size problem , consider situation serious ( Hawton , Townsend , Arensman , Gunnell , Hazell , House , &amp; Van Heeringen 1999 ) . The main problem nearly trial meta-analysis include far subject statistical power detect clinically meaningful difference rate repetition deliberate self-harm experimental control treatment , difference exist . Even result similar trial synthesize meta-analytical technique , insufficient number patient detect difference . After Cochrane review , six randomise clinical trial publish , among POPMATC study , large sample size 480 patient . The study examines effect five plus two booster session manual-assisted cognitive-behavioral-therapy session versus various control condition , bear resemblance cognitive therapy ( problem solve ) . In study , significant difference repetition self-harm experimental group control group ( Tyrer et al . 2003 ) . In randomised clinical trial , Brown et al . find cognitive therapy ( mean 9 session ) adult attempt suicide ( N=120 ) reduce repetition rate increase repetition-free period ( Brown et al . 2005 ) . Recently , Vaiva et al . publish result large French multi-centre trial telephone contact one three month compare standard treatment ( Vaiva et al . 2006 ) . Comparison experimental group combine versus standard treatment show telephone contact superior standard treatment , author point significant difference proportion repeat suicide attempt one-month telephone call group compare control treatment first 6 month trial . The odds ratio trial point direction , namely toward protective effect experimental condition . As pointed Hawton , might necessary condition combine assertive outreach . RESEARCH METHODS METHOD , DESIGN AND PROCEDURE The AID-study randomized , clinical trial . The patient include centrally randomize either standard treatment ( n = 120 ) intervention treatment ( N = 120 ) , represent 6 - 8 assertive outreach contact suicide attempts deliberate self-harm . The randomization computerize , prevention allocation bias , conduct independent research assistant research unit . The intervention team therefore know block size study group . The randomization stratify three item : 1 . First-evers previous suicide attempt , 2 . Previous psychiatric contact contact kind , 3 . Alcohol alcohol involve . Stratification variable report call research assistant charge randomization . The research assistant turn provide intervention team assign treatment participant number . The intervention team blind . The patient recruit emergency room , intensive care , psychiatric emergency room well admit psychiatric ward . After discharge contact mail phone home . The experimental intervention treatment go first six month follow six month contact . One year inclusion date patient standard treatment intervention treatment receive final call focus on-going compliance follow-up treatment . Sociodemographic data , medical status , information concerning abuse , previous psychiatric treatment previous suicide attempt obtain baseline . INTERVENTION - ASSERTIVE OUTREACH Colleagues Norway develop preventive intervention focus 'gap ' admission/emergency room outpatient treatment ( Dieserud , Loeb , &amp; Ekeberg 2000 ) . The Bærum-model name suburb north Oslo intervention first take place . The concept support guide person shortly in-hospital treatment self-injury recommend follow-up treatment base assertive principle . Poor compliance treatment address use active , care individual support assist client feeling abandon , depress , shame , ambivalent ( Dieserud , Loeb , &amp; Ekeberg 2000 ) . The Bærum-model never previously research randomize control study ( Dieserud , Loeb , &amp; Ekeberg 2001 ) . Knowing precipitate factor suicide diverse , prevention strategy likewise . The Bærum-model psychosocial approach suicide prevention underline need intervention tailor accord individual client need . The intervention indicate prevention strategy target people suicide attempts deliberate self-harm high-risk group . They offer 6-8 assertive outreach contact . The outreach contact home visit focus provide support motivate patient comply follow-up treatment . However , depend individual need , contact may include substituted admittance alcohol unit , somatic/oncological treatment , counsel family doctor , family meeting . The main target intervention encourage ensure patient refer accompanied necessary treatment actually receive recommended treatment . STANDARD TREATMENT Standard treatment consist referral range different treatment modality depend diagnosis clinical social condition patient . In standard treatment procedure ensure patient actually receive recommended treatment . Patients often refer available treatment modality general practitioner , psychological treatment , treatment alcohol abuse , often , patient responsible get contact treatment refer . OUTCOME The primary outcome measure number suicide assess Danish death-register rate repeat suicide attempts/deliberate self-harm register collaborating ward unit routine procedure treat people apply help relation suicide behaviour . ( Standardized hospital registration procedure ) . Where clear act suicide attempt medical external evaluation committee review record . STATISTICAL POWER Alfa assess 0.05 beta 0.2 , give power 80 percent ( power = 100- beta ) . According international literature ( Hawton et al . 1998a ; Owens , Horrocks , &amp; House 2002b ) expect repetition rate ( primary outcome ) 30 percent standard group 15 percent intervention group one year . Calculated require 120 people randomization treatment group ( Dupont &amp; Plummer , Jr. 1990 ) , make 240 people include together . Primary outcome base register data medical record dropout account . The data collection period limit 2 year . Patients draw two University Hospitals Copenhagen base routine registration ; likely able recruit 240 patient two-year period . STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS Statistical survival analysis use investigate difference repeat fatal non-fatal act self harm standard group intervention group . Cox-regression analysis use investigate difference two group frequency suicidal behaviour ( suicide , suicide attempt deliberate self-harm ) . Analysis adjust confound factor gender , age , treatment antidepressant . The survival rate two randomization group illustrate Kaplan-Meyer Plot . Chi-square-test , Mann-Whitney T-test use analysis compliance intensity standard intervention group .</detailed_description>
