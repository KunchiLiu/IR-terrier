	<detailed_description>Background : Interpersonal violence ( IPV ) among substance use disorder ( SUD ) patient common , undertreated , costly . SUD patient high rate perpetrate IPV , IPV risk factor poor response SUD treatment . Failure address IPV among SUD patient interfere treatment effectiveness contribute relapse high rate health service use . Nonetheless , SUD treatment program typically include violence prevention intervention study examine intervention design prevent violence perpetration among SUD patient . Objectives : This trial evaluate effectiveness IPV-prevention ( IPV-P ) intervention among patient enter VA SUD treatment perpetrate violence past year another adult . Primary objective test hypothesis , compare patient assign control condition ( CC ) , assign IPV-P would ( 1 ) improve violence SUD outcome , ( 2 ) use few VA mental health medical care service , thereby save cost VA . Secondary objective test hypothesis , compare patient assign CC , assign IPV-P would improve legal alienation problem social resource . Methods : Patients enter VA SUD treatment meet eligibility criterion ( past-year violence ; cognitively intact ) provide informed consent assign SUD usual care plus either CC ( N=60 ) IPV-P ( N=59 ) intervention use recurrent institutional design . That , IPV-P CC condition run alternate 3-month period . The manualized IPV-P group intervention , base Cognitive-Behavioral approach , consist 8 in-person group session 1 month , follow telephone call month 3 month . The manualized CC design control non-specific treatment effect associate IPV-P condition , i.e. , counselor time attention , peer support , patient ' expectation additional session provide benefit . It consist 8 in-person group session 1 month review material cover usual SUD treatment , novel method use deliver IPV-P intervention ( role-play , homework , group activity ) . CC include booster telephone session ( per month 3 month ) . Participants assess baseline end-of-intervention ( 4 month post-baseline ) 6 12 month post-intervention ( i.e. , 10 16 month post-baseline ) primary secondary outcome non-VA healthcare . Assessments consist Addiction Severity Index ( ASI , ass Alcohol , Drugs , Psychiatric , Legal functioning ) , Conflicts Tactics Scale ( CTS , assess Psychological Aggression Physical Assault another adult ) , Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire ( MDQ , assess Alienation , Stress Reaction , Aggression ) , Life Stressors Social Resources Inventory ( LISRES , assess family friend resource ) .

Follow-up analysis compare IPV-P CC group outcomes use analysis covariance control baseline value outcome . Status : We still complete portion project : ( 1 ) conduct mixed effect regression analysis compare CC IPV-P group primary secondary outcome ( analysis partially complete ) , ( 2 ) use data VA health care utilization compare two group VA health care cost ( permission download data obtain , work HERC investigator download analyze data ) .</detailed_description>
