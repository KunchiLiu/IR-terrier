	<brief_summary>Background : In patient type 2 diabetes inadequately control metformin , two main therapeutic option equally plausible : add-on sulfonylurea ( SU ) thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) . Since two class drug clearly differ term mechanisms action , side effect , economic cost cardiovascular risk factor profile , direct comparison two therapeutic strategy would appropriate . Aims : 1 ) To evaluate effect add-on pioglitazone compare add-on SU incidence cardiovascular event type 2 diabetic patient inadequately control metformin ; 2 ) To compare two treatment term glycemic control , safety , economic cost . Methods : multicentre , randomise , open label , parallel group trial 48 month duration . Eligible participant ( type 2 diabetic male female , age 50-75 year , BMI 20-45 Kg/m2 , treatment last two month metformin 2 gr/die monotherapy HbA1c &gt; =7.0 % &lt; = 9.0 % ) randomize add-on : SU - glibenclamide ( 5-15 mg/die ) , gliclazide ( 30-120 mg/die ) , glimepiride ( 2-6 mg/die ) , choose accord local practice - pioglitazone ( 15-45 mg/die ) . A HbA1c value &gt; 8.0 % two consecutive occasion lead addition insulin ongoing oral therapy . Primary efficacy outcome : composite endpoint all-cause mortality , non fatal MI ( include silent MI ) , non fatal stroke , unplanned coronary revascularization . Secondary outcome . Principal secondary outcome : composite ischemic endpoint sudden death , fatal non fatal acute MI ( include silent MI ) , fatal non fatal stroke , major amputation ( ankle ) , endovascular surgical intervention coronary , leg carotid artery . Other secondary outcome - composite cardiovascular end point include primary end point plus hospitalization heart failure , endovascular surgical intervention coronary , leg carotid artery , silent MI , angina - WHO criteria confirm new electrocardiogram abnormality - intermittent claudication ankle/brachial index lower 090 ; event heart failure ; microvascular endpoint include : plasma creatinine increase 2 time baseline value creatinine clearance reduction 20ml/min/1 . 73m2 development overt nephropathy ( dialysis plasma creatinine &gt; 3,3 mg/dl ) macroalbuminuria ; glycemic control ( change baseline HBA1c , time failure glycemic control , i.e. , HBA1c &gt; 8.0 % two consecutive occasion three month apart ) ; major CV risk factor ( lipid , blood pressure , microalbuminuria , inflammation marker , waist circumference ) ; safety side effect ; direct indirect cost . Data regard CV endpoint , safety , tolerability , study conduct monitor analyzed independent committee , available study investigator close data collection . Efficacy end point analyze intention-to-treat basis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular ( CV ) disease common cause morbidity mortality among diabetic patients.The UK Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) clearly show tight glycemic control significantly decrease diabetes-related event . Therefore , achievement HbA1c &lt; 7 % major goal treatment type 2 diabetes since parameter still represent best predictor micro macrovascular complication . However , often difficult maintain goal progressive deterioration pancreatic beta-cell function insulin sensitivity . The progressive nature type 2 diabetes generally require stepwise therapeutic approach start lifestyle intervention ( diet increase physical activity ) . After lifestyle change fail , drug therapy initiate progressively intensified combination different class hypoglycemic agent . Since insulin resistance recognize major factor pathogenesis type 2 diabetes associate CV risk factor , drug improve insulin sensitivity advise initial pharmacological therapy . Currently , metformin recommend first-line drug patient type 2 diabetes . Great uncertainty exist regard best therapeutic option diabetic patient inadequately control metformin , due lack randomize controlled trial directly compare efficacy different combination regimen achieve glycemic goal . The paucity sound clinical evidence area highlight Consensus Statement American Diabetes Association European Association Study Diabetes , suggest either sulphonylurea ( SU ) thiazolidinediones ( TZD ) additional medication metformin , absence data demonstrate superiority one combination . Addition SU TZD concomitant metformin result substantial improvement glucose control mean reduction HbA1c 1-1.5 % . However , direct evaluation treatment strategy , within large clinical trial , would appropriate , give different mechanism action , side effect cost . Indeed , direct comparison SU TZD add metformin obtain short-term study ( 24 week ) , show great reduction HbA1c association metformin-glibenclamide ( - 1.5 % ) compare association metformin-rosiglitazone ( -1.1 % , &lt; 0.001 ) . More patient receive metformin-glibenclamide reach HbA1c &lt; 7.0 % receive metformin-rosiglitazone ( 60 % vs. 47 % ) . In addition , favorable lipid profile present patient treat metformin-glibenclamide , although find confirmed study . However , short duration study preclude evaluation CV endpoint . This lack information prevent evidence-based choice two treatment option . In respect , several study underway investigate potential different glucose-lowering therapy CV outcome . With regard SU , retrospective cohort study document high risk adverse outcome patient treat SU monotherapy combination metformin compare metformin alone . In UKPDS , diabetic patient treat combination glibenclamide plus metformin show increase CV mortality compare group treatment . However , data derive post-hoc analysis , therefore , interpreted caution . In contrast , ADOPT study show low proportion CV event glibenclamide group compare rosiglitazone metformin . These conflict report underline need evaluate rate CV event induced combination metformin-SU comparison treatment strategy . Regarding TZDs , recent prospective study ( PROACTIVE Study ) compare efficacy add pioglitazone ( 15 45 mg/die ) placebo standard hypoglycemia therapy secondary prevention CV event type 2 diabetic patient . Pioglitazone treatment significantly affect primary endpoint , include all-cause mortality , non-fatal MI , stroke , acute coronary syndrome , endovascular surgical intervention coronary leg artery leg amputation , significantly reduce number patient experience secondary endpoint ( all-cause mortality , nonfatal MI stroke ) . However , patient treat pioglitazone 115 episode heart failure placebo group . In addition , weight gain 4 kg great pioglitazone placebo , much great expect basis improved glycemic control . These conflict report support need large-scale clinical trial compare efficacy association metformin plus SU vs. metformin plus TZD CV outcome . For reason , Italian Diabetes Society organize randomize controlled clinical trial long term cardiovascular effect two therapeutic strategy . The aim study ascertain whether patient type 2 diabetes poorly control metformin monotherapy , addition pioglitazone reduce rate cardiovascular event compare addition SU . Glucose control , major CV risk factor , safety , tolerability economic cost two therapeutic regimen also compare . Design : multicentre , randomize , open-label , comparative , parallel-group trial 48 month duration ( PROBE : Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-Point ) . RECRUITMENT WAS TERMINATED IN JANUARY 20147 , WITH 3040 PATIENTS ENROLLED . Screening follow-up take place several Clinical Units work collaboration network Diabetes Outpatients Clinics Italy . All study procedure perform trained study personnel accord standardize protocol . All eligible patient meet inclusion criterion , free condition list exclusion criterion give informed consent , randomize one two arm : - Metformin ( 2 gr/die ) + sulfonylurea - Metformin ( 2 gr/die ) + pioglitazone In group randomize metformin plus sulfonylurea choice glibenclamide , gliclazide glimepiride leave study physician follow local practice . Participating centre mask randomization sequence generate Epidemiology Unit `` Consorzio Mario Negri Sud '' ( Dr Nicolucci ) . Patients enter trial allocate treatment group upon telephone call clinic Epidemiology Unit verification eligibility/exclusion criterion . The randomization sequence stratify clinic , gender previous cardiovascular event . Patients see clinical follow 1 , 3 6 month randomization every 6 month unless clinical condition require frequent medical consultation develop ( accord GCP ) . Telephonic contact establish patient order take information adverse event , glycaemic control modify drug dosage . The metformin dose remain constant throughout study ; initial dose add drug 5 mg glibenclamide 30 mg gliclazide 2 mg glimepiride group randomize metformin plus SU 15 mg pioglitazone group randomize metformin plus pioglitazone . If glucose control unsatisfactory ( fast glucose &gt; 120mg/dl post prandial glucose &gt; 160 mg/dl 50 % home reading 8 week period ) , study medication uptitrated maximal effective daily dose ( i.e . 15 mg glibenclamide , 120 mg gliclazide , 6 mg glimepiride , 45 mg pioglitazone ) . If HbA1c &gt; 8.0 % observe follow visit , patient receive reinforcement lifestyle education , compliance study protocol assess glycated hemoglobin measurement repeat three month . A confirm value &gt; 8.0 % despite adherence maximal dos study medication previous three month , lead addiction single injection insulin Glargine bed-time . Insulin titration perform basis fast capillary glycemia accord pre-defined algorithm . If HbA1c &gt; 8.0 % observe two consecutive follow-up visit 3 month apart , one injection analog insulin add . Insulin titrate , accord pre-specified algorithm , frequent hypoglycemic episode occur . Use concomitant medication ( antihypertensive , lipid-lowering antiplatelet agent ) permit throughout study , accord Good Clinical Practice Guidelines . Patients stop study medication remain study following condition develops : - alanine aminotransferase increase 2.5 time baseline two consecutive occasion ( one month apart ) - sign symptom suggestive heart failure evaluate accord American Heart Association American Diabetes Association consensus glitazones heart failure ( 19 ) . - bladder cancer ( case study drug stop pioglitazone arm ) - medical condition contraindicate oral hypoglycemic treatment require stable insulin treatment . The sample size calculate base assumption study result would relevant public health point view case add-on treatment pioglitazone prove effective add-on sulfonylureas management hyperglycemia prevention chronic complication diabetes . The sample size thus estimate detect 80 % power reduction risk event 20 % ( HR=0.80 ; metformin + Pioglitazone v metformin + SU ) , p &lt; 0.05 ( one side log rank test ) .
