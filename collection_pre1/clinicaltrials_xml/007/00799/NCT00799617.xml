	<brief_summary>The Testosterone Trials multi-center set trial involve 12 clinical site geographically distribute across United States . The primary specific aim test hypotheses testosterone treatment elderly men whose serum testosterone concentration unequivocally low - symptom objectively measured abnormality least one five area could due low testosterone ( physical sexual function , vitality , cognition , anemia ) - result favorable change abnormality placebo treatment . Two additional trial incorporate T Trial . Only men enrol T Trial eligible participate trial . - The Cardiovascular Trial examine testosterone treatment result favorable change cardiovascular risk factor , compare placebo . - The Bone Trial test hypothesis testosterone treatment increase volumetric trabecular bone mineral density ( vBMD ) lumbar spine measure quantitative compute tomography ( QCT ) , compare placebo treatment . A Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) Study also conduct within context interventional T Trial . It examine variability serum testosterone ( T ) concentration application testosterone gel placebo , four month start treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Testosterone Trial Older Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As men get old , experience many condition , often together , eventually result inability perform many activity daily live , increased propensity fall , decreased independence . These condition include mobility disability low vitality . Elderly men also experience increase anemia , metabolic syndrome , decrease sexual function memory impairment . These condition likely multiple cause , one cause could contribute low serum testosterone concentration . When young hypogonadal men treat testosterone , experience improvement sexual function , muscle mass strength , bone mineral density , sense well , anemia . However , benefit testosterone therapy old men age-related decline testosterone concentration know subject investigation . Participants treat testosterone placebo gel 1 year . The dose adjust blinded fashion achieve target T level range . Participants follow one additional year follow treatment phase assess adverse event . - Men participate Cardiovascular Trial assess change atherosclerotic plaque burden 0 12 month . - Men participate Bone Trial assess QCT spine hip , DXA spine hip clinical fracture 0 12 month . - Men participate PK Study attend 3 additional study visit blood draws time 4-month assessment .</detailed_description>
