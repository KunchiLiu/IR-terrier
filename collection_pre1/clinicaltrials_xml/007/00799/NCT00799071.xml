	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Posaconazole Children With Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At moment itraconazole drug first choice prophylaxis fungal infection child CGD . Breakthrough fungal infection itra-conazole prophylaxis describe literature indicate need drug broader antifungal spectrum . PSZ might provide need . PSZ may also clinical safety tolerability advantage antifungal agent . Because PSZ metabolize phase II glucuronidation less common subject drug interaction . PSZ known CYP3A4 inhibitor , inhibit CYP enzymes , therefore may exhibit few drug interaction compare azole antifungal agent . Treatment child still off-label use . No data publish date exposure PSZ child age 8 child CGD . There urgent need study use PSZ young child . Furthermore , current regimen antifungal prophylaxis require three time daily administration PSZ . For specific purpose less complex dosing schedule warrant thus define need examine twice daily schedule . As tolerability pharmacokinetics unknown patient age 8 year limit data available age group 8 16 year , propose feasibility study twice daily regimen PSZ prophylaxis CGD patient . With information available suggest dosage future prophylaxis patient group .</detailed_description>
