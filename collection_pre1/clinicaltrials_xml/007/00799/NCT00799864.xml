	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate pharmacokinetics ( body drug ) , safety effectiveness rilpivirine ( TMC278 ) 25 milligram ( mg ) adjust dose daily combination investigator-selected background regimen contain 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) ( zidovudine [ AZT ] /lamivudine [ 3TC ] abacavir [ ABC ] /3TC ) antiretroviral ( ARV ) treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Pharmacokinetics , Safety , Tolerability , Antiviral Efficacy Rilpivirine ( TMC278 ) Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Adolescents Children Aged Greater Than Equal 6 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open-label ( people involve know identity assign drug ) single arm study . The study consist screen period maximum 8 week , initial treatment period 48 week , post week 48 treatment extension period 4 year , 4 week follow-up period take place regardless presence serious adverse event ( SAEs ) patient withdraw early ( ie , Week 48 ) patient participate extension Week 48 ; Week 48 , 4-week follow-up visit require case ongoing ( S ) AEs final treatment visit . The initial 48-week treatment period structure 2 age Cohorts ; Cohort 1 ( Aged great equal [ &gt; = ] 12 less [ &lt; ] 18 year ) Cohort 2 ( Children Aged &gt; = 6 &lt; 12 year ) Cohort 2 part . The first part trial ( Part 1 ) design evaluate steady-state pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile short-term safety antiviral activity rilpivirine 25 mg adjust dose daily administer combination 2 NRTIs . At Week 2/4 , intensive PK do analysis together short-term safety antiviral activity review data monitoring committee ( DMC ) . For adolescent ( Cohort 1 ) mean steady-state exposure first group patient comparable adult population ( ie , within 80-125 percentage mean exposure 25 mg daily dose group study , TMC278-C204 ) , Week 2/4 safety antiviral activity result review deemed satisfactory DMC , second part trial start . The second part trial evaluate long-term ( 48 week 240 week ) safety , efficacy , pharmacokinetics rilpivirine combination background regimen 2 NRTIs primary analysis time point 24 week . For patient age great equal ( &gt; = ) 6 less ( &lt; ) 12 year ( Cohort 2 ) , treat least 4 week Week 2 intensive PK Week 4 safety antiviral activity review result satisfactory , recruitment Part 1 resume additional subject enrol least 10 subject Part 1 . Once appropriate RPV dose select , Part 1 Cohort 2 consider complete Part 2 start . All patient Part 1 roll Part 2 additional patient recruit Part 2 least 25 subject ( include Part 1 ) overall . In cohort trial , ART consist rilpivirine 25 mg adjust dose daily investigator-selected background regimen contain 2 NRTIs . Patients safety monitor throughout study follow visit .</detailed_description>
