	<brief_title>Enteral Naloxone Versus Traditional Bowel Regimen Prevention Opioid Induced Constipation Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Impaired gastric motility constipation common issue among patient intensive care set . Contributing factor include trauma , multiple surgical procedure , lack ambulation , use opiate analgesic control pain . Common treatment alter gastric motility constipation include administration pro-motility agent , stool softener bowel stimulant . Enteral feeding consider safest effective way provide nutrition critically ill patient . Nutrition delay and/or held impaired gastric motility constipation present . Studies suggest delay administration nutrition lead prolonged ventilator time increase length stay intensive care set well increase mortality . Naloxone , competitive opioid antagonist , commonly administer systemically counteract central peripheral effect opioids . When administer enterally naloxone also find increase gastric empty . Studies patient receive enteral feed multiple risk factor alter gastric motility constipation suggest administration enteral naloxone reduce incidence extent alter gastric motility aid defecation totally reverse systemic effect opiate administer . Due finding , appear enterally administer naloxone would provide significant advantage traditional gastrointestinal stimulant prevent constipation critically ill patient receive continuous administration opiate analgesic . In addition , use enterally administer opiate antagonist may also alleviate need routine administration pro-kinetic agent order promote adequate gastrointestinal motility toleration enterally administer nutrition . As result , comparison enteral naloxone plus stool softener versus traditional bowel regimen contain stimulant stool softener aid assess effectiveness opiate reversal locally gastrointestinal tract prevention decrease gastric motility constipation .</detailed_description>
