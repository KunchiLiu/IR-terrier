	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : The primary objective study assess safety efficacy data bortezomib/melphalan/prednisone ( BMP ) regimen previously untreated transplant ineligible multiple myeloma patient . This international , multicentred , open-label , single-arm , non-comparative study . After provide write informed consent , patient evaluate eligibility screening period 14 day ( Days -14 Day -1 ) . Baseline efficacy safety assessment perform Day 1 ( first day treatment ) prior study drug administration patient measurable monoclonal paraprotein ( M-protein ) within least 14 day patient extramedullary plasmacytoma . Patients previously untreated multiple myeloma candidate high dose chemotherapy stem cell transplant high dose therapy/stem cell transplant ( HDT/SCT ) enrol . Approximately 150 patient enrol study . Patients receive BMP treatment , consist Bortezomib ( twice weekly [ Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 22 , 25 , 29 32 ] four 6-week cycle [ 8 dos per cycle ] follow weekly [ Days 1 , 8 , 22 , 29 ] five 6-week cycle [ 4 dos per cycle ] ) combination melphalan prednisone daily Days 1 4 6-week cycle . Treatment continue maximum 9 cycle ( 54 week ) discontinue disease progression unacceptable treatment-related toxicity occur , patient withdraws consent . The Final Visit/Early Termination Visit occur 30-42 day last dose Bortezomib . Investigators ask report TTP every 6 month Final Visit disease progression period 2 year . Safety assess monitoring adverse event , physical ( include neurological/peripheral neurological ) examination , vital sign measurement , hematology clinical chemistry test . Karnofsky performance status FACT/GOG-Ntx also assess . Efficacy evaluation serum urine M-protein level together extramedullary plasmacytoma evaluation do begin cycle . Investigator report TTP subsequent therapy also capture . The secondary objective assess neurotoxicity use FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire , capture investigator report time progression ( TTP ) data . STUDY POPULATION : The patient population comprise maximum 150 male female patient , symptomatic multiple myeloma asymptomatic multiple myeloma relate organ tissue damage , presence measurable disease , Karnofsky performance status score great equal 60 point , clinical hematology chemistry laboratory value meet predefined criterion . It expect approximately 150 patient enrol . Potential patient exclude candidate HDT/SCT ; diagnosis smolder multiple myeloma , monoclonal gammopathy undetermined significance ( MGUS ) , Waldenström 's disease ; prior current systemic therapy multiple myeloma ; radiation therapy , plasmapheresis , major surgery within 30 day study entry ; peripheral neuropathy neuropathic pain Grade 2 high . EFFICACY EVALUTIONS : Measurements M-protein follow serum 24-hour urine baseline ( prior treatment Day 1 Cycle 1 ) , prior treatment Day 1 Cycles 2-9 , Final Visit . The Final Visit/Early Termination Visit occur 30-42 day last dose Bortezomib . It recommend patient 100 % disappearance original monoclonal protein serum urine result confirm immunofixation . Investigators also ask complete CRF follow-up form every 6 month 2 year Final/Early Termination Visit capture TTP . SAFETY EVALUATIONS : A physical examination ( include neurological/peripheral neurological examination , vital sign , blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate , temperature ) , karnofsky performance status , hematology , clinical chemistry test obtain screen ; Day 1 cycle prior dose Bortezomib ; Final Visit/Early Termination Visit occur 30-42 day last dose Bortezomib administer . Hematology test also obtain prior dose cycle 1 2 every week thereafter . Safety also assess report adverse event start sign ICF , treatment , last study relate procedure Final Visit/Early Termination Visit . The intensity ( severity ) adverse event assess use National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) common toxicity criterion ( CTC ) Version 3.0 . All adverse event ( exclude grade 1 2 lab abnormality ) start sign ICF , Final Visit/Early Termination Visit record case report form ( CRFs ) . Clinically relevant change laboratory safety test , vital sign , physical/neurological examination record adverse event . Serious adverse event report within 24 hour knowledge event member investigational site sponsor facsimile ( fax ) , use SAE form , provide sponsor . STUDY ANALYSIS : Adverse event , serious adverse event , M-protein , extramedullary plasmacytoma measurement , FACT/GOG-Ntx Karnofsky performance status data summarize . Response study treatment base M-protein extramedullary plasmacytoma reduction also assess analysis . Patients receive BMP treatment , consist Bortezomib IV bolus infusion 1.3m^2 ( twice weekly [ Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 22 , 25 , 29 32 ] four 6-week cycle [ 8 dos per cycle ] ) follow weekly [ Days 1 , 8 , 22 , 29 ] five 6-week cycle [ 4 dos per cycle ] ) combination oral melphalan 9mg/m^2 oral prednisone 60 mg/m^2 daily Days 1 4 6-week cycle . The max total treatment duration study 54-weeks ( 9 six-week cycle ) .</detailed_description>
