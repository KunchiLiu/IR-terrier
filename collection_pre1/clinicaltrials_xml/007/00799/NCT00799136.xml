	<brief_summary>No standard regimen currently exist treatment AIDS-related lymphoma . Based encouraging NCI result DA-EPOCH , US AIDS Malignancy Consortium currently administer phase II randomize protocol compare EPOCH sequential versus concurrent rituximab ( AMC protocol 034 ) . In AMC trial , decision co-administer cART leave discretion treat physician patient . While AMC phase II study may establish acceptable chemotherapy regimen suitable study phase III randomize trial , result address adherence , pharmacokinetic interaction role cART AIDS-related lymphoma . The contribution cART anti-lymphoma efficacy regimen need formally study . Our propose trial demonstrate feasibility co-administering cART chemotherapy would justify use combine therapy future AMC/International phase III protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study Co-administering Combination Antiretroviral Therapy ( cART ) R-EPOCH Chemotherapy Management ARL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design &amp; Duration This prospective , single-arm , multi-centre , phase II trial immuno-chemotherapy ( rituximab EPOCH ) mandatory combination antiretroviral therapy initial treatment AIDS-related lymphoma . Patients diagnose previously-untreated AIDS-related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma eligible trial . Patients eligible regardless whether previously treat naïve antiretroviral therapy . The total sample size 18 patient require determine feasibility co-administering cART chemotherapy measure adequate adherence antiretroviral regimen . Patients receive EPOCH rituximab chemotherapy 6 cycle give every 21 day . Day 1 cycle consist infusion rituximab follow initiation 96-hour continuous infusion etoposide , doxorubicin , vincristine oral prednisone . Cyclophosphamide administer Day 5 initial dose base initial CD4+ cell count minimize hematologic toxicity . Combination antiretroviral therapy administer patient enrolled trial . Patients already respond current cART regimen continue therapy . Otherwise , patient initiate preferred regimen tenofovir ( TDF ) , emtricitabine ( FTC ) , efavirenz ( EFV ) accord US Department Health Human Services ( DHHS ) guideline . Patients initiated preferred regimen TDF/FTC/EFV start antiretroviral treatment Day 7 trial , first cycle R-EPOCH administer . Treatment subsequently continue duration trial thereafter , accord discretion treat physician . The primary endpoint feasibility study medication adherence cART treatment . `` Acceptable adherence '' define proportion patient able complete &gt; 90 % prescribed cART dose course chemotherapy measure pill count . As previously report , study participant ask bring pill bottle clinic prior chemotherapy cycle ( every three week ) remain pill count participate study nurse/pharmacist . The number miss dos compute difference actual expect number pill remain bottle . Secondary outcome include toxicity combination therapy , measure adverse event grade accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Version 3.0 . CD4+ cell count HIV-1 mRNA viral load obtain patient baseline , following recovery cycle 3 6 , every three month thereafter two year . Secondary outcome also include complete partial lymphoma response rate , progression-free survival , overall survival , define International Working Group criterion . The pharmacokinetics etoposide , vincristine doxorubicin study patient initiate preferred antiretrovirals TDF/3TC/EFV Day 7 protocol ( completion first cycle R-EPOCH ) . Thus analysis PK interaction subgroup patient receive uniform treatment strategy . Pharmacokinetics assess first cycle ( chemotherapy give alone ) subsequent cycle R-EPOCH ( chemotherapy give cART ) . Study administration data collection occur auspex Ontario Clinical Oncology Group ( OCOG ) . OCOG operate within Clinical Trials Methodology Group Henderson Research Centre Hamilton co-directed oncologist Juravinski Cancer Centre Toronto Sunnybrook Cancer Centres . OCOG well-established research environment guide administration trial across four unique clinical site across Canada . The clinical site study include Toronto Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre ( TSRCC ) , Princess Margaret Hospital ( PMH ) , St. Michael 's Hospital ( SMH ) , St. Paul 's Hospital ( SPH ) Vancouver . Each clinical site expect enroll 1-4 patient per year . An overall accrual rate 8-10 patient per year expect . Therefore , possible register 18 patient within 2 year study initiation . For individual patient , chemotherapy treatment duration 18 week . Following phase therapy ( 18 week ) , individual patient follow every 3 month additional 2 year .</detailed_description>
