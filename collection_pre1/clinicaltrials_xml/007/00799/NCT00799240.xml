	<brief_summary>This study compare rate chemotherapy : pemetrexed cisplatin compare combination pemetrexed/cisplatin MK-0646 . The purpose determine long control cancer growth toxicity safety combination . Laboratory research tumor tissue blood obtain do assess IGF-1R expression relate marker correlate response survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MK-0646 Insulin Growth Factor 1 Receptor Antibody Stage IIIb IV Metastatic Non-Squamous Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin-like Growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) tyrosine kinase receptor regulate cell growth , proliferation apoptosis . ( 4 ) Increased IGF1 signal result upregulation proliferation inhibition apoptosis RAF PI3K pathway . ( 5 ) Several type cancer , include non-small cell lung cancer , express IGF-1R ligand . The sequestration IGF IGF bind protein associate improved survival patient resect stage I lung cancer . ( 6 ) High expression IGF-1R associate poor survival surgically resect stage I lung cancer , specifically adenocarcinoma subtype . Patients adenocarcinoma never smoker high expression IGF-1R vs. squamous cell carcinoma smokers. ( 7 ) . Low IGF-1R expression associate significant improvement survival adenocarcinoma lung cancer lack correlation expression IGF1R survival patient squamous cell histology . Monoclonal antibody target extracellular domain IGF-IR small molecule inhibit IGF-1R kinase . This potential new strategy treatment lung cancer .</detailed_description>

Patients brain metastasis eligible provide complete brain radiation , neurologically stable , dexamethasone least 1 week prior registration . Patients asymptomatic brain metastatic disease eligible require radiation neurologically stable without dexamethasone . measurable disease document CT , MRI , Xray physical exam . Measurable disease must assess within 28 day prior registration . Pleural effusion , ascites laboratory parameter acceptable evidence disease . Nonmeasurable disease must assess within 28 day prior registration . All disease must assess document . Prior radiation permit ; least one week must elapse since completion prior radiation therapy must recover associated toxicity time registration . Measurable nonmeasurable disease must outside previous radiation field new lesion must present . At least 4 week elapse since surgery ( thoracic major surgery ) patient recover associated toxicity time registration . Measurable disease must present outside area surgical resection . There must anticipation need major surgical procedure protocol treatment . Age ≥ 18 year old . ECOG performance status 01. adequate bone marrow function define platelet count least 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dl , leukocyte count least 3,000/mm OR absolute neutrophil count least 1,500/mm3 . adequate hepatic function document serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5x upper normal limit , AST ALT , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 x IULN within 28 day prior registration . ( Except presence know hepatic metastasis , wherein AST ALT may 5 X upper normal limit . ) serum creatinine ≤ institutional upper limit normal ( IULN ) AND calculate measure creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/mm use Cockcroft Gault Formula .
