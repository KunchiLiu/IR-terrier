	<brief_summary>This multicenter , immunogenicity surveillance registry employ prospective , cohort design patient use erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESA ) accord normal practice consistent medical indication . Subjects observe development immunogenicity PRCA 3 year . Information exposure ESA product , ESA product handle storage , recent hemoglobin level collect quarterly case report form . For case suspect PRCA , serum specimen test EPO antibody Division Nephrology , Chulalongkorn University Laboratory . An Advisory Board ( ADB ) periodically review blinded case data subject unexplained loss efficacy ( LOE ) , identify case EPO antibody-mediated PRCA responsible data summary make recommendation relate incidence rate PRCA associate S.C. ESA use . The registry provide inducement change therapy non-interventional . The primary objective study estimate incidence anti-human Erythropoiesis anti-EPO PRCA , develop patient . The diagnosis PRCA bone marrow biopsy must prerequisite antibody assay . The secondary objective evaluate efficacy ESA treatment erythropoiesis deficiency anemia . Registry subject adult men woman receive receive ( within 1 month ) market ESA product s.c. route administration time enrollment . The marketed ESAs include innovative ESA biosimilar ESA . Potential subject enrol receive Erythropoiesis product less 1 year . Cases EPO antibody-mediated PRCA determine clinical presence essential criterion unexplained LOE , administration ESA product , bone marrow biopsy diagnosis PRCA , presence EPO antibody . The serum patient meet criterion assay neutralization .</brief_summary>
