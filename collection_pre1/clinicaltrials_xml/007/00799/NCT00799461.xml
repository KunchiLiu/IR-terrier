	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : A personalized Internet-based program may help improve fatigue , depression , quality life long-term survivor stem cell transplant . It yet know whether Internet-based program effective without telephone-based problem-solving training . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study well Internet-based program work without telephone-based problem-solving training help long-term survivor hematopoietic stem cell transplant cope late complication</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internet-Based Program With Without Telephone-Based Problem-Solving Training Helping Long-Term Survivors Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Cope With Late Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy randomize control trial improve long term fatigue/physical dysfunction , depression/distress health surveillance behavior adult 3 25-year hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) survivor use internet internet phone-based problem-solving activation training compare survivor randomize delayed internet access control . II . To determine reach , utilization , implementation cost web-based , individually tailor intervention , disseminate widely use patient information website , target national cohort adult 2-25 year HSCT survivor . ( Phase III/IV ) III . To determine , randomize control trial , efficacy nationally disseminate , internet-based , individually tailor intervention improve long-term fatigue , distress health promotion behavior HSCT survivor , compare survivor randomize delayed internet access control . ( Phase III/IV ) OUTLINE : Patients elevate fatigue , depression , and/or distress baseline randomize 1 3 arm ( ARMS I , II , III ) . Patients without elevated fatigue , depression distress baseline randomize 1 2 arm ( ARMS II III ) . ARM I ( FULL WEBSITE ACCESS WITH PROBLEM-SOLVING TRAINING [ PST ] ; FIRST STUDY ONLY ; CLOSED TO ACCRUAL ) : Patients receive full access INSPIRE website 6 month , offer individually tailor greeting home page link information target area identify elevated baseline assessment manage complication ; bulletin board input survivor solicit , edit , post weekly ; resource page ; opportunity send secure message question comment . Patients also undergo 4-8 phone-based PST session behavioral health specialist . ARM II ( FULL WEBSITE ACCESS WITHOUT PST ) : Patients receive full access INSPIRE website 6 month ARM I . ARM III ( DELAYED WEBSITE ACCESS ) : Patients access INSPIRE website 6 month . After 6 month , patient receive full access INSPIRE website 3 month .</detailed_description>
