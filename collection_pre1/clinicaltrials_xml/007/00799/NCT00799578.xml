	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) steatohepatitis represent spectrum disease occur absence alcohol abuse . It characterize presence steatosis may represent hepatic manifestation metabolic syndrome ( include obesity , diabetes hypertriglyceridemia ) . NAFLD link insulin resistance , cause liver disease adult child may ultimately lead cirrhosis ( Skelly et al. , 2002 ) . The histologic spectrum NAFLD range relatively benign isolate predominantly macrovesicular steatosis ( i.e. , nonalcoholic fatty liver NAFL ) steatohepatitis ( NASH ) ( Angulo , &amp; Lindor , 2002 ) . The latter characterize histologic presence steatosis , cytological ballooning , scatter inflammation pericellular fibrosis ( Contos &amp; Sanyal , 2002 ) . Estimates prevalence among child infer pediatric obesity data knowledge 85 % child NAFLD obese . Data National Health Nutrition Examination Survey reveal threefold rise prevalence childhood adolescent obesity past 35 year ; data 2000 suggest 14-16 % child 6-19yrs age obese BMI &gt; 95 % ( Fishbein , Miner , Mogren &amp; Chalekson , 2003 ) , also fact 85 % child NAFLD obese . Treatment NASH currently revolve around reduction two main pathogenetic factor , namely , fat accumulation within liver excessive accumulation free radical cause oxidative stress . Glutathione ( gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine ; GSH ) major endogenous antioxidant depletion implicate development hepatocellular injury ( Wu , Fang , Yang , Lupton &amp; Turner , 2004 ) . Glutathione enter easily cell , even give large amount . However , glutathione precursor enter cell show effective treatment condition acetaminophen toxicity prevent significant GSH depletion ( Prescott &amp; Critchley , 1983 ) . Examples GSH precursor include cysteine , N-acetylcysteine , methionine sulphur-containing compound cysteamine ( Prescott , Park &amp; Proudfoot , 1976 ) . Studies demonstrate orally intravenously administer cysteamine mouse human effective acetaminophen-induced hepatocellular injury ( Prescott , 1972 ; Prescott , Stewart &amp; Proudfoot , 1978 ; Mitchell , Thorgeirsson , Potter , Jollow &amp; Keiser , 1974 ) . Another study N-acetylcysteine use treat NASH period 4-12 week demonstrate improved amniotransferase level ( Pamuk &amp; Sonsuz , 2003 ) , suggest increase GSH level may hepato-protective role may useful treatment NASH . A possible mode action cysteamine might react extracellular cystine form cysteine readily take cell transform GSH . Recent study suggest essential amino acid cysteine major limit factor GSH synthesis factor ( e.g. , insulin growth factor ) stimulate cysteine uptake cell generally result increased intracellular GSH level ( Lyons et al. , 2000 ; Lu , 2000 ) . Cysteamine , GSH precursor , currently available use treatment cystinosis , intra-lysosomalcystine storage disorder . In cystinosis , cysteamine act convert cystine cysteine cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfide able leave lysosome cysteine lysine porter respectively ( Gahl , Theone &amp; Shneider , 2002 ) . Within cytosol mixed disulfide reduce reaction glutathione cysteine release use GSH synthesis . The synthesis GSH cysteine catalyze two enzyme , gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase GSH synthetase . This pathway occur almost cell type , liver major producer exporter GSH . The reduced cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfide also release cysteamine , , theory able re-enter lysosome , bind cystine repeat process ( Dohil et al. , 2006 ) . In recent study child cystinosis , enteral administration cysteamine result increased plasma cysteamine level , subsequently cause prolonged efficacy lower leukocyte cystine level ( Dohil et al. , 2006 ) . This may due `` re-cycling '' cysteamine adequate amount drug reach lysosome . If cysteamine act fashion , GSH production may also significantly enhance .</detailed_description>
