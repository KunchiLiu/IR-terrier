	<brief_summary>Summary Brief Summary Standard care pain relief cesarean delivery spinal morphine . Spinal morphine may unsuitable patient general anesthetic prior morphine-related side effect less effective patient morphine tolerance . An alternative TAP block local anesthetic deposit abdominal muscle consequently numb area provide pain relief . The investigator believe TAP block provide equivalent pain relief spinal morphine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing 2 Types Pain Relief After Cesarean Delivery : Spinal Morphine TAP Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description In North America , standard care neuraxial morphine . This effective analgesic , still cause problem nausea , vomit itching . Spinal morphine may unsuitable patient morphine-related side effect past less effective patient morphine tolerance . It also poorly suit patient general anesthetic , anesthesiologists routinely access spinal space purely analgesia . It use spinal route surgical anesthesia , also deposit morphine provide pain relief surgery . The abdominal wall incision important contributor pain follow cesarean delivery . The nerve supply anterior abdominal wall internal oblique transversus abdominis muscle . By deposit local anesthetic solution muscle side , possible block nerve provide analgesia incision anterior abdominal wall . This known transversus abdominis plane block TAP block . Studies show TAP block useful midline laparotomy open prostatectomy , bowel resection rescue analgesia abdominal surgery . There two study look specifically TAP block cesarean delivery none compare directly current standard . This study direct comparison spinal morphine TAP block . Obviously , adequate analgesia paramount importance patient caring . Studies date indicate TAP block provide similar analgesia spinal morphine early post-operative period . Therefore would reasonable alternative patient spinal morphine tolerate spinal morphine due side effect . The primary objective investigate whether tranversus abdominis plane block provide equivalent analgesia post-cesarean delivery , intrathecal morphine . The secondary objective determine whether difference post-operative abdominal scar pain , three month post-surgery . This study prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind study . The study involve two group . Both group spinal anesthesia surgery provide 9-12 mg heavy bupivacaine 10 mcg fentanyl . 1 . Control group : standard care plus placebo block . 2 . Intervention group : additional spinal medication give ultrasound-guided TAP Block give instead standard intrathecal morphine . Standard post-cesarean analgesia PONV order resume post-delivery .</detailed_description>
