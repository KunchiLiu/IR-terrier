	<brief_title>Evaluating Effectiveness Adding Rituximab Standard Treatment Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( TTP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TTP disorder cause blood clot form small blood vessel throughout body . If clots fact block blood vessel , blood flow restrict various organ , include brain , kidney , heart . This lead neurological problem , stroke , abnormal kidney function , heart problem . Because large number platelet use blood clot process , people TTP reduce number platelet circulate blood . They also fewer red blood cell circulate blood red blood cell break prematurely blood squeeze past blood clot . The primary treatment TTP plasmapheresis , also call plasma exchange , procedure circulate person 's blood machine first remove damage plasma add healthy donor plasma blood . Next , patient receive blood transfusion new blood . Corticosteroids , type medication reduces amount antibody person 's body make , also commonly use conjunction plasma exchange treat TTP . Plasma exchange usually effective , platelet red blood cell count return normal procedure complete . However , people experience relapse TTP require repeat plasma exchange . Rituximab , antibody currently use treat lymphoma rheumatoid arthritis , may improve immune system response decrease number day need undergo plasma exchange procedure . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness rituximab combination plasma exchange improve early treatment response people TTP decrease likelihood relapse TTP . This 3-year study enroll people recently diagnose TTP recently experience relapse yet six plasma exchange current episode TTP . Participants randomly assign receive either plasma exchange corticosteroids plasma exchange , corticosteroid , rituximab . Blood collect participant baseline day undergo plasma exchange procedure . All participant receive plasma exchange every day platelet count normal sign tissue damage improve . Participants receive corticosteroid medication every day plasma exchange stop , time dosage gradually taper 7 week last plasma exchange . Participants receive rituximab receive first dose intravenously within 7 day first plasma exchange ; continue receive rituximab week 4 week . After plasma exchange complete , participant routine follow-up care doctor make sure TTP relapse . In 1 year study entry , additional blood collection occur vary time . Study researcher monitor participant ' health 3 year study entry follow doctor periodic phone call . A portion blood collect stored future TTP research purpose ; optional .</detailed_description>
