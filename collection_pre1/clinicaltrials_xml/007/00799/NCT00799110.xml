	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate effect ( good bad ) dendritic cell/tumor fusion vaccine combination laboratory make agent GM-CSF imiquimod participant immune system . Another purpose study determine type severity side effect associate new study vaccine . We also evaluate effect vaccine participant cancer . Dendritic cell vaccine already test clinical trial involve participant many different type cancer . Dendritic cell powerful immune-stimulating cell normally find small amount body responsible immune response `` foreign '' substance enter body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination Patients With Ovarian Cancer With Dendritic Cell/Tumor Fusions With Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) Imiquimod</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients must undergo therapeutic debulking surgery independent clinical indication tissue frozen store sterile condition part protocol 07-319 ( Study Primary Tumor Harvest Purpose Possible Use Future Clinical Trial Patients Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer ) - Participants assign one two study group . Both group undergo procedure know leukapheresis white blood cell remove participant blood order obtain dendritic cell . Prior procedure participant may receive 4 injection GM-CSF , help increase white blood cell count . - If enough cell obtain leukapheresis , tumor cell dendritic cell fuse ( mixed ) together laboratory divide appropriate dos administration . - Participants assign Group 1 undergo subcutaneous vaccination dendritic cell tumor fusion vaccine . On day vaccine three day afterwards , receive GM-CSF injection site vaccination . Participants receive dose vaccine every 3 week total 3 vaccination . - Participants assign Group 2 undergo subcutaneous vaccination dendritic cell tumor fusion vaccine . On day vaccine three day afterwards , receive GM-CSF injection site vaccination . Additionally , imiquimod cream apply skin injection sight 2 hour vaccine administration . Participants continue apply imiquimod cream site vaccination 3 day follow injection . Participants receive dose vaccine every 3 week total 3 vaccination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion time initial enrollment : Patients must undergo therapeutic debulking surgery independent clinical indication tissue frozen store sterile condition part protocol 07319 ( Study Primary Tumor Harvest Purpose Possible Use Future Clinical Trial Patients Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer ) Patients histologically proven stage III IV ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal serous carcinoma ( patient stage recurrent disease ) demonstrate lack disease progression determine clinical assessment well CA125 level and/or radiographic assessment Patients must ECOG performance status 02 great six week life expectancy . All patient must inform investigational nature study must give write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . Laboratories : WBC &gt; 2.0 X 103/uL , Platelets &gt; 50,000/uL , Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL , Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL , AST/ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN Eligibility criterion prior first vaccination At maximum twelve week last dose chemotherapy , patient must fulfill follow criterion : Complete clinical response firstline chemotherapy newlydiagnosed patient , secondline chemotherapy relapse patient require secondary cytoreduction . ** Asymptomatic , low volume disease require chemotherapy prior initiate vaccination ** Complete clinical response define normal exam , normal CT scan , normal CA125 level . Tumor tissue relapse patient would obtain inform consent time secondary surgical debulking , would perform part standard relapse management appropriate patient . Resolution chemotherapy relate grade IIIIV toxicity Laboratories : WBC &gt; 2.0 X 103/uL , Platelets &gt; 50,000/uL , Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL , AST/ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN Patient progressive disease first line chemotherapy platinum/taxane combination exclude . Patients must clinically significant autoimmune disease require treatment immunosuppressant medication . Because compromised cellular immunity limit capacity respond vaccination , patient HIV+ exclude . Patients must serious intercurrent illness infection require IV antibiotic , significant cardiac disease characterize significant arrhythmia , unstable ischemic coronary disease congestive heart failure . Pregnant and/or lactate woman exclude . Premenopausal patient undergo pregnancy test indicate . Women practice effective birth control receive protocol treatment . Patients history clinically significant venous thromboembolism exclude . Active second malignancy , aside basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin ( i.e . malignancy treat curative intent diagnosis within past 2 year )</criteria>
