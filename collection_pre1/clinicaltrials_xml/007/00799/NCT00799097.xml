	<brief_summary>Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) common health condition United States result 200,000 surgical procedure annually . The field rhinology two major advance investigator believe make accurate prediction postoperative outcome possible thereby offer potential reducing frequency unsuccessful surgical procedure . The first advance development validate disease-specific quality life instrument measure outcome CRS management . The major medical society recognize disease-specific quality life gold standard assess outcome disease purpose study , investigator define surgical outcome change disease-specific quality life ( QOL ) . The second advance well understanding pathological process result CRS . The previous construct define disease anatomic obstruction sinus secretion . This thought best measure CT scan main method attempt select best candidate surgery . The investigator hypothesize utilize new conceptual framework , investigator better predict surgical outcome . The investigator examine several preoperative factor relationship surgical outcome . The factor examine include measure pathophysiological component inflammation anatomic obstruction well preoperative extent disease measure preoperative disease-specific quality life . The investigator hypothesize factor provide complimentary information may variably express individual CRS patient . Therefore , investigator hypothesize novel integration multiple preoperative factor form useful predictive model surgical outcome . Finally prospective study provide opportunity add field identify potentially novel risk factor comorbidities well study secondary outcome sinus surgery include olfactory function general health relate quality life systematic manner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A cohort 500+ patient CRS undergo sinus surgery three center prospectively enrol . Patient demographic , comorbidity data , objective testing , QOL evaluation occur preoperatively outcome ( QOL olfactory test ) measure 6 , 12 , 18 month postoperatively . Determinants change QOL analyze univariate multivariate method include construction multivariate predictive model . This proposal focus patient undergo surgical intervention management CRS . The finding potentially apply 200,000 patient annually undergo sinus surgery work toward long-term goal develop comprehensive system measure extent disease disease severity treatment response rigorously quantify 30 million patient CRS .</detailed_description>
