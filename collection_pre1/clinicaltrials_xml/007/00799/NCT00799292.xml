	<brief_summary>Vasoconstrictive agent increasingly use order decrease blood loss vaginal hysterectomy . The first report study use vasoconstrictive agent purpose use epinephrine inject intracervically preoperatively England , et . al . They demonstrate significant decrease amount blood lose surgery also demonstrate significant increase risk post-operative infection , frequently vaginal cuff cellulitis require antibiotic treatment . Recent study use vasopressin vasoconstrictive agent also find significant decrease blood loss demonstrate difference rate post-operative infection . The recent study Speer Unger , Kammerer-Doak , et.al . large , well design study consider credible . More surgeon therefore inject vasopressin intracervically preoperatively . Some surgeon believe injection vasopressin intracervically prior initial incision vaginal hysterectomy effect surgical plain therefore make surgical dissection difficult . This thought possibly add operative time increase rate complication . The aforementioned study use injection saline control injection vasopressin epinephrine . To date , study compare use vasopressin versus injection control , randomize manner . We know injection saline intracervically may actually increase amount bleed baseline therefore decrease blood loss cause injection vasopressin actually overestimate . We propose compare effect inject vasopressin intracervically preoperatively versus preoperative medication . We evaluate amount operative blood loss , also compare operative time complication rate .</brief_summary>
