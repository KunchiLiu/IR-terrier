	<brief_summary>One common way prevent coronary heart disease ( CHD ) take aspirin clopidogrel . However , study show people respond medication . The variance treatment response may link genetics . This study examine effect aspirin clopidogrel population whose gene well know order determine role gene play treatment response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determining Genetic Role Treatment Response Anti-Platelet Interventions ( The PAPI Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CHD lead cause death United States . Anti-platelet agent lessen platelet aggregation use commonly prevent recurrent CHD event . Two common anti-platelet agent aspirin clopidogrel . However , 25 % 30 % people respond medication . Evidence indicate treatment response may relate genetics . The purpose study determine specific gene variant predict response aspirin clopidogrel therapy . This study part large group study call Pharmacogenomics Research Network ( PGRN ) . Participants include Old Order Amish Lancaster , Pennsylvania . They well suit genetic study homogenous , close , founder population . Participants receive 300 mg clopidogrel first day , 75 mg clopidogrel per day next 6 day . On last day clopidogrel treatment , participant take single dose 324 mg aspirin . Participants undergo platelet function test clopidogrel alone , take clopidogrel plus aspirin . Using gene variation profile across genome , researcher analyze gene correspond treatment response .</detailed_description>
