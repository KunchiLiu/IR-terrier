	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cell kill breast cancer cell . Giving vaccine therapy together aldesleukin may effective treatment metastatic breast cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give vaccine therapy together aldesleukin work treat woman metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Allo LMI Vaccine With IL-2 Stable Metastatic Breast Ca</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine efficacy allogeneic large multivalent immunogen ( LMI ) vaccine aldesleukin , define clinical benefit rate ( percentage patient demonstrate complete response , partial response , disease stabilization assess RECIST criterion ) , woman stable metastatic breast cancer . Secondary - To measure immune response patient treat regimen . - To determine progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - To determine 1- 2-year overall survival rate patient treated regimen . - To determine safety profile toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive allogeneic large multivalent immunogen ( LMI ) vaccine intradermally day 1 aldesleukin subcutaneously day 7 8 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression 2 course vaccine therapy resume chemotherapy regimen prior disease stabilization achieve . Beginning 2-4 day completion chemotherapy , patient receive one dose LMI vaccine follow aldesleukin day 7 8 . Patients achieve least stable disease continue receive LMI vaccine aldesleukin . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample collect periodically research study . Samples analyze assess frequency leukocyte subset ( include B cell , T cell , NK cell , monocyte ) via flow cytometry ; frequency T-regs ( T cell express CD4 , CD25 , FoxP3 ) ; response keyhole limpet hemocyanin tetanus toxoid via ELISA assay . Other immunological study also perform . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
