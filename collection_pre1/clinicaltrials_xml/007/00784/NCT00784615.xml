	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) frequent endocrine disease woman reproductive age , estimate prevalence 5 10 % accord studied population . Its cause remain fully understood . PCOS characterize hyperandrogenism , chronic anovulation / polycystic ovary . Patients , high percentage case show obesity , hirsutism , acne , menstrual irregularity infertility . Clinically biologically PCOS heterogeneous disorder yet clear pathogenesis . Therefore , discussion definition diagnosis still subsist . Seventy year ago Stein Leventhal publish finding 7 woman amenorrhea , hirsutism , acne , obesity polycystic appearance ovary . Since , diagnostic criterion PCOS suffer multiple modification . In 1990 group expert auspices National Institutes Health ( NIH ) consider affected PCOS every woman hyperandrogenism chronic anovulation ; exclude specific disease mimic clinic like Cushing 's syndrome , androgen secrete tumor congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( NIH criterion ) . The presence polycystic ovary ultrasound exploration consider controversial criterion include diagnosis . In May 2003 new committee expert join Rotterdam auspice American Society Reproductive Medicine ( ASRM ) European Society Human Reproduction Embryology ( ESHRE ) , include polycystic ovary ultrasound physiologic abnormality diagnosis . Thus , diagnosis include unless two follow : oligo anovulation ; hyperandrogenism ( clinic biochemical ) polycystic ovary ultrasound examination . Rotterdam consensus widen definition already propose NIH 1990 give rise four subgroup phenotype : 1- Women polycystic ovary , hyperandrogenism oligoamenorrhea . 2 . Women normal ovary , hyperandrogenism oligoamenorrhea . 3- Women polycystic ovary , oligoamenorrhea without hyperandrogenism . 4- Women polycystic ovary , hyperandrogenism normal menses . This new criterion increase de prevalence , diversity also controversy PCOS . Some author like Franks accept new consensus give significant advance etiological knowledge syndrome . Others , like Azziz , propose premature include ovulate woman one clear evidence androgen excess . In last subgroups clear increase risk cardiovascular / metabolic disease . The clinical heterogeneity syndrome product multifaceted process ; converge genetic environmental influence . Many hypothesis try explain primary defect ; insulin resistance ( IR ) seem suitable accord study . IR present 60 70 % patient independently obesity . Compensatory hyperinsulinism fundamental role pathology PCOS . In vitro insulin stimulates androgen synthesis ovary theca cell , act receptor inhibits hepatic synthesis sex hormone bind globulin ( SHBG ) , increase free testosterone . It also lead amplification LH induce expression cytochrome P450c 17 alfa ( limit enzyme androgen synthesis ) . PCOS share components Metabolic Syndrome high prevalence IR ( abdominal obesity , impair glucose tolerance , type 2 diabetes , hypertension , endothelial dysfunction , impaired lipid profile probably cardiovascular disease ) . Dunaif Sam use NIH criterion PCOS diagnosis suggest sole entity call XX syndrome . Central adiposity seem play important role development metabolic phenotype trough production many cytokine adipocytes derive protein , know `` adipocytokines '' . Failures regulation could contribute development IR . The late one trough metabolic disturbance associate endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis . Adiponectin exclusively secrete adipose tissue could inhibit expression vascular endothelial adhesion molecule induce TNF-alfa . So , could anti atherogenic effect adiponectin . In obese subject type 2 diabetes IR ( high incidence coronary atherosclerosis ) find low plasma level adiponectin . Recent study propose low serum level adiponectin early marker metabolic risk woman PCOS . C Reactive Protein ( CRP ) , low grade inflammation marker , suggest independent predictor cardiovascular event woman ; even relevant LDL cholesterol . Those fact reassure recent publication Reynolds risk score add classical ATP IIIÂ´s Framingham score ; usage CRP woman , increase prognostic value . Higher level CRP describe woman PCOS compare normal control . All finding lead u assume woman PCOS increase risk develop cardiovascular disease . As universally accept definition PCOS , study show association PCOS cardiovascular disease relative value . Legro state `` It premature assume every PCOS phenotype cardiac metabolic risk factor '' . So , important evaluate endocrine metabolic characteristic different phenotype PCOS prevent co morbidity predispose cardiovascular disease . And course avoid unnecessary measure group could show increase risk .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Two follow Ovulatory Dysfunction : Clinically define oligomenorrhea ( menstrual cycle last 35 day ) amenorrhea ( lack menstruation last 90 day ) . In patient menstrual cycle 25 35 day , serum level progesterone drawn day 21 23 cycle &lt; 4 ng/ml . Clinical hyperandrogenism define presence hirsutism , acne , androgenic alopecia ) biochemical ( increase total testosterone , bioavailable testosterone free androgen index ) . Polycystic Ovaries : Defined presence , le one ovary , 12 follicle ( measure 2 9 mm diameter ) increase ovarian volume &gt; 10 mL ) . Hyperprolactinemia Hypothyroidism Other cause hyperandrogenism like Cushing 's Syndrome , congenital adrenal hyperplasia , androgens secrete tumor Drug therapy use three month previous enrollment study</criteria>
