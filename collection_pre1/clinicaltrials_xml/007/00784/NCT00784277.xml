	<brief_title>A Study Compare Frequency Constipation Symptoms With Tapentadol Immediate Release ( IR ) Treatment Versus Oxycodone IR Treatment Patients With End-stage Joint Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pain end-stage degenerative joint disease often moderate severe intensity result relatively constant level pain require continuous pain relief medication . Despite available pain relief medication , 60 % 80 % subject suffer chronic pain currently inadequately treat . Opioid pain medication central effective treatment moderate severe pain . However , opioid therapy frequently complicate side effect . Constipation one commonly report side effect debilitate . An opioid medication provide pain relief reduce incidence constipation symptom would improve capability subject stay medication achieve long-term relief need . This randomized , double-blind , placebo- active-controlled , parallel-arm , multicenter study 4 treatment group subject moderate severe chronic pain end-stage degenerative joint disease hip knee candidate primary total partial joint replacement . The study consist 3 period : pretreatment period ( 14-day screening study eligibility 7-day washout previously take opioid medication ) , double-blind treatment period ( 14-day IR treatment phase follow 28-day ER treatment phase ) , follow-up period ( 1 study-site visit within 4 day last dose study drug take 1 telephone contact within 10 14 day last dose study drug take ) . On Day 1 IR treatment phase , patient randomly assign 1 4 possible treatment group receive 50 mg CG5503 IR , 75 mg CG5503 IR , 10 mg oxycodone IR , placebo daily every 4 6 hour . At begin ER treatment phase , patient ' study drug transition ER form ( conversion IR approximate equivalent total daily dos ER form ) randomly assign study drug tapentadol ER , oxycodone CR , placebo . The ER study drug take every 12 hour b.i.d . Dosages adjustable , study site personnel oversight , ensure adequate pain relief provide . Beginning washout period , patient give hand-held computer diary record pain intensity , pain relief , bowel movement information , answer question nausea vomit may occur . In addition , patient write time dosages medication take study medication diary . Safety tolerability assess use physical examination , monitor adverse event , clinical laboratory measure , 12 lead ECG result . The first study hypothesis tapentadol IR dosages effective placebo relieve pain base SPID score record patient first 5 day study . The second study hypothesis Bowel Function Patient Diary result tapentadol IR dosage demonstrate improve tolerability compare oxycodone IR 10 mg , base number spontaneous bowel movement per week first 2 week study . In IR treatment phase , patient take CG5503 IR 50 mg , CG5503 IR 75 mg , oxycodone IR 10 mg , placebo orally every 4 6 hour 14 day . In ER treatment phase , dosages IR treatment group convert approximately equivalent dosage ER form assign study drug : tapentadol ER , oxycodone CR , placebo . Dosages may range 100 500 mg/day tapentadol ER 20 60 mg/day oxycodone CR take orally 2x daily 28 day .</detailed_description>
