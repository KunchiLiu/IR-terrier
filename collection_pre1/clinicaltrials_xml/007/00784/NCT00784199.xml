The item bank administer 20,000 respondent calibrate use model base item response theory ( IRT ) . Using IRT calibration , computerized adaptive test ( CAT ) algorithm develop implement . The network design series study use clinical population evaluate item attribute , examine utility CATs , validate item bank . More information PROMIS network find www.nihpromis.org .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order validate item bank examine utility computerize adaptive test ( CATs ) , PROMIS network design series study allow u examine attribute measure `` real-world '' clinical environment . This protocol aim compare psychometric property PROMIS item bank non-PROMIS `` gold standard '' instrument currently use respective field ( pain mental health ) . In context , note propose study intend evaluate treatment effectiveness , control group include . The main consideration design study involve ecologically valid treatment establish efficacy administer evaluate short term ( i.e. , 3 month ) . Regardless impact aggregate , treatment generate considerable variability individual outcomes , heterogeneity optimal examine relevant psychometric issue . The psychometric issue great concern validity PROMIS item bank evidence convergent discriminant validity responsiveness change . We also make initial estimate clinically significant change reflect PROMIS measure . By combine effort two site lead development item bank emotional distress ( University Pittsburgh ) pain ( University Washington ) , study maximize total sample size provide fertile ground analyse psychometric function PROMIS bank . In addition psychometric question , also address clinically meaningful question relate pain , depression , relationship two . The complex relationship pain depression observe year . Both syndrome mutually exacerbatingâ€”pain worsens depression depression worsen experience pain . The domain-related issue great interest focus interaction depression pain impact treatment outcome ( include change symptom depression pain , acute clinical status , social functioning ) .</detailed_description>
