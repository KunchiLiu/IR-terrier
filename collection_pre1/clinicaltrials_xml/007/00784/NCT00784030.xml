	<brief_summary>Polycystic kidney disease ( PKD ) genetic disease occur 1 500 individual lead kidney failure half affect . Currently , treatment exist PKD . PKD-affected kidney cell divide multiply inappropriately , form fluid-filled sac call cyst . Kidney cyst continue grow throughout life , destroy normal kidney tissue , lead kidney failure . Based evidence basic science research believe drinking high amount water slow abnormal cyst growth . This study aim look change urine composition high water intake PKD-affected person compare healthy individual .</brief_summary>
