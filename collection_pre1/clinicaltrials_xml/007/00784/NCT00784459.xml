	<brief_summary>This study design determine treatment abatacept effective decrease allergic airway inflammation mild , atopic asthmatic . Subjects recruit great St Louis Metropolitan area . Eligible individual undergo titrate skin prick test . Following baseline evaluation , fiberoptic bronchoscopy segmental allergen challenge ( SAC ) perform . The subject randomize either placebo abatacept . After 12 week study drug , subject undergo repeat SAC . The primary endpoint determine treatment abatacept result 50 % great decrease percentage eosinophil recover bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid follow SAC compare placebo control . Secondary endpoint include measure airway obstruction hyperreactivity , airway inflammation symptom well determination safety abatacept administration subject population .</brief_summary>
