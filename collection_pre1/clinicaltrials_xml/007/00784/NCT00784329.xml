	<brief_title>Pilot Study To Evaluate Optical Frequency Domain Imaging For Diagnosis Of Central Airway Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate potential new image device , Optical Frequency Domain Imaging ( OFDI ) image pulmonary malignancy central airway . The prevalence high mortality rate associate Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma lack widely accept screen surveillance tool , highlight need new image paradigm ultimately lead reduction patient mortality . Bronchial carcinoma in-situ progress invasive cancer 40 % individual , although progression occur long period time , majority carcinoma detect later stage disease development , offer patient slim chance cure . Although , significant effort development screen paradigms detection lung cancer central airway make , date still widely accept validated approach . Optical Frequency Domain Imaging ( OFDI ) recent derivative optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . As OCT , OFDI interferometric ranging technique roughly consider optical analogue ultrasound image provide tomographic image tissue resolution comparable architectural histology . The long term goal study use OFDI screen airway hope detect Squamous Cell Carcinoma earlier curable stage . Standard care bronchoscopy preparation procedure follow , moderate sedation , pulse oximetry blood pressure monitor per department protocol . A combination currently approve bronchoscopy technique include stand white light bronchoscopy , autofluorescence bronchoscopy , narrow band image use ass airway . Bronchial region interest ( ROI 's ) suspect premalignant malignant , identify bronchoscopy procedure , image use OFDI system catheter biopsy do . It anticipate obtain minimum 3 OFDI-biopsy correlate pair study participant . An additional OFDI image biopsy obtain region 's normal interest ( ROI 's ) . It expect experimental procedure add less 10 minute total length bronchoscopy procedure , stop rule institute ensure experimental procedure exceed 20 minute .</detailed_description>
