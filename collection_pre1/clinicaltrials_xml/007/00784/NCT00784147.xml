	<brief_summary>The investigational product , ibalizumab , humanize IgG4 monoclonal antibody administer via intravenous infusion 800 mg every 2 week 2000 mg every 4 week . In addition study drug , patient receive optimize background regimen ( OBR ) , standard-of-care regimen select investigator prior randomization comprise 2-4 antiretroviral agent . These agent must approve local regulatory agency available expanded-access program treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Response Study Ibalizumab ( Monoclonal Antibody ) Plus Optimized Background Regimen Patients With HIV-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study : - Evaluate dose-response relationship antiviral activity ibalizumab dose regimens Week 24 order determine optimal dose regimen . The primary evaluation effectiveness base proportion patient achieve undetectable viral load Week 24 . - Evaluate safety tolerability two dose regimen ibalizumab dose selection The secondary objective study : - Evaluate change Baseline viral load , CD4+ cell count , time loss virologic response ( TLOVR ) - Characterize HIV-1 sensitivity/susceptibility change associate ibalizumab administration combination OBR - Determine presence significance anti-ibalizumab antibody , ( immunogenicity ibalizumab ) - Assess CD4 receptor density occupancy - Determine impact ibalizumab quality life assess patient-reported outcome questionnaires - Evaluate pharmacokinetic profile two dose regimen ibalizumab steady state</detailed_description>
