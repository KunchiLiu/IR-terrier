	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate native tissue optical property photosensitizer optical property vivo novel , non-contact optical imaging device call Modulated Imaging help optimize laser exposure future photodynamic treatment patient skin cancer . Photodynamic therapy involve administration tumor-localizing photosensitize agent , illuminate proper wavelength light , result photochemical process cause irreversible damage tumor tissue . Photodynamic therapy non-invasive show effective treatment skin cancer produce excellent aesthetic appearance psychological well-being patient normally would require invasive excision .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Photodynamic Therapy Cutaneous Neoplastic Diseases Via Structured Illumination Real-time Dosimetry .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard care skin cancer excision , curettage electrodesiccation and/or cryosurgery . The Modulated Imaging measure tissue optical property effect Photodynamic therapy treatment process show spectral absorption scatter coefficient , oxy- deoxy-hemoglobin , water , melanin use information provide customize laser light treatment . The researcher use image system characterize tissue photosensitizer optical property use information drive treatment light projection system spatially optimize light irradiance personalize treatment , thus improve outcome .</detailed_description>
