	<brief_summary>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) NIH Roadmap initiative develop computerized system measure patient-reported outcome respondent wide range chronic disease demographic characteristic . In first four year existence , PROMIS network develop item bank measure patient-reported outcome area pain , fatigue , emotional distress , physical function , social functioning . During item banking process , PROMIS network conduct focus group , individual cognitive interview , lexile ( read level ) analyse refine meaning , clarity , literacy demand item . The item bank administer 20,000 respondent calibrate use model base item response theory ( IRT ) . Using IRT calibration , computerized adaptive test ( CAT ) algorithm develop implement . The network design series study use clinical population evaluate item attribute , examine utility CATs , validate item bank . More information PROMIS network find www.nihpromis.org .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation PROMIS Banks With COPD Exacerbations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective longitudinal study adult patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) enrol COPD consider clinically stable acute exacerbation . This design allow within-person between-person comparison exacerbation experience . Comprehensive clinical patient-reported assessment perform baseline 3 month ( end study ) . Subsets item administer interactive voice response ( IVR ) course study measure change key symptom course recovery exacerbation . A subset patient interview end study ass content validity PROMIS item patient population . With study design , able evaluate validity PROMIS item patient population acute stable condition evaluate responsiveness several PROMIS item bank condition know change underlie chronic disease . We also evaluate stability sub-domains hypothesize change COPD exacerbation .</detailed_description>
