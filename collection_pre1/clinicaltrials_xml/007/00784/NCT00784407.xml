	<detailed_description>Although harmonic scalpel show safe effective thyroid surgery , several surgeon consider previously available instrument large cumbersome , especially term tissue fine grasp dissection capability . To context , innovative technical improvement device thyroid surgery recently implement make available 2008 . Utilization new device , however , evaluate study . The objective prospective randomize study compare result total thyroidectomy use new harmonic scalpel device ( FOCUS ) previously available harmonic scalpel device ( HARMONIC ACE ) respect hemostasis , operative time postoperative complication . All patient submit total thyroidectomy randomize two group : submit total thyroidectomy use FOCUS device ( group Α ) HARMONIC ACE ( group Β ) .</detailed_description>
