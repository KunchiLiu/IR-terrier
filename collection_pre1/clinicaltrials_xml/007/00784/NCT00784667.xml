	<brief_summary>This clinical trial investigate effectiveness safety combination study drug cetuximab erlotinib patient advance ( metastatic ) refractory colorectal ( bowel ) cancer . If bowel cancer spread organ ( metastatic colorectal cancer ) , usually incurable life-expectancy without treatment le 6 month average . Currently , chemotherapy show significant impact advance colorectal cancer term maintenance quality life extension survival . However , ultimately tumours develop resistance chemotherapy . Treatment option subsequent survival stage limit . Therefore , new therapeutic approach urgently need . It common colorectal cancer cell contain growth receptor , like antenna , surface regulate growth . The drug use trial show effective target one growth receptor ; epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Cetuximab antibody ( protein produce immune system involve defense body infection ) EGFR . Cetuximab show improve survival patient chemotherapy refractory advanced colorectal cancer . Erlotinib protein prevents activation hence signal EGFR . Erlotinib improve survival patient advanced lung cancer . Although , drug know effective inhibiting EGFR give alone , least case , hop use two drug target receptor pathway different way provide effective treatment . 50 patient four hospital Australia participate trial , approximately 25 patient enrol Austin Health . All participant receive treatment . Neither study drug chemotherapy , hence expect treatment would well tolerate . The frequent side effect associate EGFR inhibitor skin rash . Other possible side effect diarrhea low magnesium level .</brief_summary>
