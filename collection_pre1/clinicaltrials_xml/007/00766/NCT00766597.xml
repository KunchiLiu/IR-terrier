	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Vicriviroc Combination Regimens HIV-Infected ART Experienced Children Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) include protease inhibitor ( PI ) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) become standard treatment HIV-infected adult child . When effective , HAART decrease viral population , increase body 's immune response , lead decreased disease progression increase survival . However , several factor include poor adherence , drug toxicity , drug resistance complicate HIV management allow child adolescent develop resistance multiple drug class , leave limited therapeutic option . Fortunately , drug new mechanism action , HIV entry inhibitor , demonstrate activity even people resistance currently available reverse transcriptase protease inhibitor . The purpose study test effectiveness safety Vicriviroc ( VCV ) , HIV entry inhibitor . Vicriviroc target CCR5 chemokine receptor , HIV use bind enter CD4+ cell . This study two-stage , age-stratified , non-comparative study explore safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic profile antiviral activity investigational CCR5 inhibitor Vicriviroc HIV-infected treatment experience child adolescent . In Step I participant screen co-receptor CCR5 ass whether enter Step II . Only participants CCR5-tropic virus eligible Step II - main portion study evaluate study outcome measure . Those participant continue Step II assign one four age-stratifies cohort receive vary form , either liquid tablet , Vicriviroc : Cohort I : 12 year less 19 year age , receive tablet formulation VCV Cohort II : 6 year less 12 year age , receive tablet formulation VCV Cohort III : 6 year less 12 year age , receive liquid formulation VCV Cohort IV : 2 year less 6 year age , receive liquid formulation VCV Dose strengths 20 mg 30 mg use , liquid formulation concentration 1mg/mL . Step II compose Stage I Stage II . Stage I dose range study design explore body respond different dos vicriviroc , include safety factor associate dosage . After optimal dosage information safety measure assess different cohort Stage I , Stage II open . Stage II evaluate long term safety , tolerability effectiveness vicriviroc . The study , include Steps I II last approximately 48 week . Follow-up subject expose vicriviroc last 5 year initial exposure . Visits every 3 month subject study provide vicriviroc every 6 month subject discontinue vicriviroc . The study terminate shortly initiation , drug company decide discontinue development study drug . As study termination , nine participant enrol Cohort I Step I , 4 participant CCR5 tropism receive study medication Step II . All 4 participant limited post-baseline data .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed HIV infection Treatment experience subject : Children adolescent unchanged therapeutic regimen least 12 week experience virologic failure OR participant treatment 4 week history virologic failure prior therapeutic regimen . Likely virus sensitive least one ritonavir boost protease inhibitor HIV viral load great equal 1,000 copies/ml within 90 day prior Step I entry Able swallow study medication , tablet liquid form specific ageassigned cohort Parent , legal guardian participant able willing provide sign informed consent participant follow clinic site Willing use effective method contraception Inclusion Criteria Step II ( In addition inclusion criterion Step I ) : Participant 's plasma HIV test Step I must R5 tropic Genotypic sensitivity enable participant take optimize background therapy ( OBT ) consist least ritonavirbased protease inhibitor . More information criterion find study protocol . Presence currently active AIDS defining illness history malignancy History seizure disorder require current antiseizure medication control risk seizure . Those history febrile seizures alone exclude . Certain abnormal laboratory value . More information criterion find protocol . Any vaccination 14 day prior Step I , schedule occur within 14 day prior entry Step II , week 24 48 visit Step II Allergy sensitivity study drug ingredient Taking Step II disallow medication ( see protocol ) unable unwilling discontinue least one week prior enter Step II Use NNRTIs etravirine 21 day prior Step II entry Pregnancy breastfeeding . Infants receive breastmilk allow enroll . Exclusion Criteria Step II All exclusion criterion Step I Participants harbor dual mixed tropic virus ( R5/X4 ) X4 virus non phenotypable virus Current anticipate use disallow medication Use efavirenz , nevirapine , delavirdine 21 day prior Step II entry Pregnant within 3 day Step II entry</criteria>
