	<brief_summary>102 late- life adult risk develop type 2 diabetes mellitus , randomize one three intervention design improve insulin sensitivity thereby potentially preventing future progression type 2 diabetes . The investigator predict insulin sensitivity improve equally follow either weight loss exercise , additive effect combine intervention . The investigator hypothesize weight loss decrease intermuscular adipose tissue , intramyocellular lipid , visceral abdominal adipose tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skeletal Muscle Lipid Insulin Resistance : Effects Physical Activity Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective project examine role skeletal muscle lipid capacity fat oxidation insulin resistance old adult either high risk development type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) untreated newly diagnose T2DM . A randomized intervention trial conduct examine effect physical activity weight loss , alone combination , intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) , intermuscular adipose tissue ( IMAT ) abdominal AT ( adipose tissue ) , oxidative capacity insulin resistance . The first aim examine effect weight loss without exercise AT distribution , intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) oxidative capacity skeletal muscle conjunction improvement insulin sensitivity . We test hypothesis weight loss without exercise : 1 ) Improve insulin sensitivity , decrease lipid intersperse within muscle ( intermuscular AT ) , intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) , well visceral abdominal AT ( VAT ) ; 2 ) Will effect either skeletal muscle oxidative capacity determine vitro vivo . A second aim examine effect exercise without weight loss AT , IMCL , oxidative capacity insulin resistance . We test hypothesis exercise without weight loss : 1 ) Increase oxidative enzyme capacity muscle ; 2 ) Increase IMCL despite little effect AT distribution within muscle ( intermuscular AT ) visceral AT ; 3 ) Improve insulin sensitivity similar degree weight loss without exercise . A third aim examine combine effect exercise weight loss insulin resistance . Our third hypothesis combine weight loss exercise 1 ) Decrease IMAT , VAT little overall effect IMCL 2 ) Improve oxidative capacity skeletal muscle ; 3 ) Confer synergistic improvement insulin sensitivity combine action AT skeletal muscle capacity oxidation . A fourth aim examine combine effect exercise weight loss subject newly diagnose untreated T2DM . Our final hypothesis exercise weight loss similar effect subject newly diagnose T2DM compare risk develop T2DM regard improve insulin sensitivity , body composition oxidative capacity skeletal muscle .</detailed_description>
