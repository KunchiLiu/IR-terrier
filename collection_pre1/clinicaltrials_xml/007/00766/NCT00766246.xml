	<detailed_description>This phase II clinical trial address issue bevacizumab treatment duration treatment safety first-line therapy patient non-squamous NSCLC . Following disease progression treatment failure , potential benefit continue bevacizumab therapy test randomize patient two treatment arm , include second-line chemotherapy without bevacizumab . It hypothesize continuation bevacizumab pemetrexed second-line treatment follow progression result improve clinical outcome patient NSCLC .</detailed_description>
