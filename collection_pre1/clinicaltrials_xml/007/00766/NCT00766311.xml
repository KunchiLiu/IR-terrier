	<brief_summary>Survivors childhood leukemia muscle weakness impaired mobility ( physical performance ) , high expect frequency obesity , early mortality cardiovascular disease . Treatment related neuropathy , cardiotoxicity general cachexia may complicate physical performance establish pattern sedentary behavior may lead lifetime inactivity . There limited evidence child treat leukemia benefit home exercise program maintenance phase therapy , particularly term muscle strength range motion . However , establish guideline regard prescription exercise child diagnose leukemia . We propose test feasibility exercise intervention among child treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) hypothesize child participate exercise intervention demonstrate improvement gross motor function , strength , flexibility , cardio respiratory fitness , favorable body composition compare child assign usual activity group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerobic Strengthening Exercise Acute Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose trial determine feasibility aerobic strengthen exercise intervention trial among child maintenance therapy childhood ALL evaluate participant accrual , participant compliance , burden institutional staff . We anticipate key barrier exist threaten successful completion interventional trial exercise within ALL patient population . Approximately 2,500 3,500 child diagnose year ALL similar number enter maintenance phase therapy give year . About 22 % diagnose 5 8 year old . Thus accrual limit small patient population fortunately patient ALL receive care dedicate pediatric oncology institution . Lack interest lack understand underlie problem obesity weakness among survivor ALL population may additional barrier accrual . In addition , family may overwhelm primary diagnosis leukemia feel unable take additional challenge . Compliance rigorous exercise regimen must ascertain demonstrable improvement motor performance , body composition cardiovascular disease risk profile occur . Key study short-term compliance design intervention promote improve long-term rate exercise . Barriers compliance include length time complete intervention , number day intervention must administer , perceive benefit participant , difficulty intervention , inadequate demonstration intervention , poor understanding participant/parent importance obesity weakness among survivor childhood ALL , health issue regard primary diagnosis ALL . We open feasibility study 3 institution dedicate treatment childhood cancer : St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital , Oregon Health &amp; Science University Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center .The accrual goal study total 20 patient . The hypothesized outcome aim feasibility study accrual rate 50 % eligible patient give institution . Motor Function The Bruinicks-Osteretsky Test Motor Proficiency Version 2 ( BOT-2 ) use measure participant ' motor function . Maximum isometric knee extension strength measure hand hold myometer hand grip strength measure hand hold dynamometer . Additionally , flexibility measure sit reach test . Ankle dorsiflexion active passive range motion measure goniometer . Aerobic capacity measure modify Cooper 6 minute walk test . Body composition vital sign also collect . Intervention Participants receive counsel write material regard benefit exercise individualize exercise instruction session base result baseline test individual preference . Each program include ability specific stretching/flexibility , progressive resistive strengthening , aerobic exercise . Necessary equipment strengthen ( weight , stretch cord , elastic band ) aerobic component also provide . A videotape demonstrate exercise intervention give participant parent . '' Detailed write instruction , along book log exercise , also provide . Stickers small toy provide parent give child complete exercise . Participants receive weekly phone call exercise coach , answer question progress intervention . Participants also receive counsel review/progression exercise intervention usual clinic visit ( approximately monthly ) . During pilot study , participant continue receive intervention six month , weekly phone call taper every week three month . The exercise coach available participant/parent need via phone and/or email throughout intervention period .</detailed_description>
