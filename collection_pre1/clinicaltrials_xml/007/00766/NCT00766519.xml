	<brief_title>Effect Intraoperative Volume Optimization Outcome After Intrabdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study strongly suggest intraoperative oesophageal doppler guide fluid management may improve outcome intrabdominal surgery . In study , however , number patient often small , management control group well postoperative complication usually precisely define . In addition , widespread use oesophageal doppler advocate routine surgery , strategy necessitates repeat volume load . This may lead unnecessary intravenous fluid may deleterious , intraoperative fluid restriction also show improve clinical outcome . In context , index reflect hemodynamic change mechanical ventilation ( so-called `` dynamic index '' , specifically respiratory-induced pulse pressure variation ) show accurately predict fluid responsiveness mechanically ventilated patient . Automated continuous calculation pulse pressure variation variation standard peripheral ( typically radial ) arterial line recently validate . This study thus design determine whether intraoperative goal-directed fluid management ( goal = cardiac stroke volume maximization ) base pulse pressure variation monitoring would improve outcome intrabdominal surgery .</detailed_description>
