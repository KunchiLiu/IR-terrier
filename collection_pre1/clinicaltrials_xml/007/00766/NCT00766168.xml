	<detailed_description>Seventy six ( 76 ) subject ( 152 eye ) enrol dispensed multisite , randomize , double mask clinical study provide data support presumption equivalence HDS HI 1.54™ investigational lens historical control contact lens . Sixty four ( 64 ) subject ( 84.2 % ) complete study 12 subject ( 15.8 % ) discontinue . The population demographic similar previous contact lens study . Of ten Test subject discontinue , Difficulty Cleaning Lenses ( 3 subject ) Poor Comfort ( 2 subject ) , Poor Vision ( 1 subject ) Poor Vision Poor Comfort ( 2 subject ) account 80 % discontinuation . Two Control subject discontinue , one Loss Interest one Poor Comfort There adverse event report study . The study related complication slit lamp finding grade 3 injection . Each resolve without complication . Slit lamp finding report frequency within expect value positive slit lamp observation primarily grade 1 ( trace ) . Staining injection report frequently . Subject report symptoms low 1 week visit Completed Test Control eye increase remainder study . Discomfort report frequently ( 13.7 % Completed Test eye visit 12.3 % Completed Control Eye visit ) . . Lens comfort rat average 4.04 ( good ) Completed Test eye 4.07 ( good ) Completed Control eye . This compare baseline value 3.96 Test eye 4.23 Control eye pre-study habitual correction . Keratometry change within 1.00 diopter 93.1 % Completed Test eye 96.4 % Completed Control eye . Manifest refraction change within 1.00 diopter 97.9 % Completed Test eye 98.2 % Completed Control eye . One eye 63 Completed Test eye target full distance vision report show decrease contact lens visual acuity baseline best correct visual acuity great 0.20 logMAR . The reason loss report baseline measurement error . One eye 48 Completed Control eyes target full distance vision report show decrease contact lens visual acuity baseline best correct visual acuity great 0.20 logMAR . The reason cite decrease lens switch eye eye . Average lens wearing time stable 13 hour per day Completed Test Control subject show decrease time discontinue eye . Forty nine ( 49 ) lens replacement make 40 152 eye dispense study . The replacement predominantly deposit ( 8 ) parameter power change ( 21 ) together account 59 % lens replacement . Discomfort cite 18.4 % ( 5 test 4 control lens ) lens replacement . Five lens ( 10 % ) replace due loss . The result clinical evaluation Paragon HDS HI 1.54™ contact lens provide evidence substantial equivalence historical control , Paragon Fluroperm® 30 contact lens .</detailed_description>

Subjects must best spectacle correct visual acuity least 0.30 logMAR ( 20/40 ) eye . 3 . All subject must treat bilaterally . 4 . Subjects must willing capable return schedule followup visit period least 3 month . 1 . Female subject pregnant , breastfeed intend become pregnant course study . 2 . Subjects history follow medical condition : collagen vascular disease , autoimmune disease , immunodeficiency disease , ocular herpes zoster simplex , endocrine disorder ( include , limited active thyroid disorder diabetes ) , lupus , rheumatoid arthritis . NOTE : The presence diabetes ( either type 1 2 ) , regardless disease duration , severity control , specifically exclude subject eligibility . 3 . Subjects history intraocular corneal surgery ( exclude cataract extraction refractive surgery ) , active ophthalmic disease abnormality ( include , limited , blepharitis , recurrent corneal erosion , dry eye syndrome , neovascularization &gt; 1mm limbus ) , clinically significant lens opacity , clinical evidence trauma ( include scar ) , evidence glaucoma propensity narrow angle glaucoma determine gonioscopic examination either eye . NOTE : This include patient open angle glaucoma , regardless medication regimen control . Additionally , patient IOP great 21 mm Hg baseline specifically exclude eligibility . 4 . Subjects evidence keratoconus , corneal irregularity , abnormal videokeratography either eye . 5 . Subjects participate clinical trial ( FDA ) .</criteria>
