Admission North Texas Traumatic Brain Injury Model System-affiliated rehabilitation unit within 8 week injury . Enrollment TBI-MS database require . 4 . Randomization within 2 - 10 week injury . 5 . Rancho Los Amigos Rating IV good time randomization . Should Rancho IV level 4 week randomization . 5 . GH deficiency diagnose either follow two criterion : 1. . Peak GH response L-arginine stimulation test &lt; 1.4 microg/L ; 2. . Plasma IGF-1 level 1 SD expect median age body weight . 6 . Availability caregiver oversee administration medication . 7 . Reasonable expectation completion outcome measure 8 . Residence inside United States . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . History pre-existing neurologic disease ( epilepsy , brain tumor , meningitis , cerebral palsy , encephalitis , brain abscess , vascular malformation , cerebrovascular disease , Alzheimer 's disease , multiple sclerosis , HIV-encephalitis ) 2 . History premorbid disable condition interfere outcome assessment 3 . Contraindication rhGH therapy . ( hypersensitivity rhGH component supply product , include metacresol , glycerin , benzyl alcohol ) 4 . Penetrating traumatic brain injury 5 . Diabetes mellitus . 6 . Obesity ( BMI &gt; 30 ) . 7 . Active infection . 8 . Active malignant disease . 9 . Acute critical illness , heart failure , acute respiratory failure 10 . Previous hospitalization TBI &gt; 1 day 11 . Membership vulnerable population ( prisoner ) 12 . Pregnancy . Women childbearing age give pregnancy test screen exclude pregnancy . 13 . Lactating female We measure baseline IGF-1 well carry L-arginine GH stimulation test prior entry study , measure IGF-1 level completion treatment phase . 2 . Treatment . After obtain informed consent , measure IGF-1 level well perform dynamic GH testing . Eligible patient randomization double-blind fashion ( Group 1 ) rhGH subcutaneously ( Group 2 ) placebo . The GH treatment arm receive start dose 400 microg/day , increase ( decrease ) dose 100-200 microg/day month , monitor side effect , goal IGF-1 ( upper quartile range age body weight ) reach maximum dose 1,000 microg/day . Dose adjustment may modify investigator participant receive oral estrogen circumstance know influence GH dose atypical response treatment . Doses participant receive placebo also adjust monthly maintain blinding . The treatment overseen board certify endocrinologist ( Dr. Auchus ) , accord practice guideline recently release Endocrine Society `` Clinical Guidelines Evaluation Treatment Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency '' . The principle therapy start relatively low dose increase monthly , adjust occurrence adverse effect . In study , accommodate GH-deficient GH-sufficient stratum , treatment goal serum IGF-1 close possible upper limit age-adjusted reference range without exceed normal range . The objective randomization produce study group comparable respect know unknown risk factor , remove investigator bias recruitment allocation participant guarantee statistical test valid significance level . To balance factor may influence treatment outcome , randomization stratify block , two factor : 1 . Age ( &lt; 35 year vs. &gt; 35 year ) 2 . Severity injury ( duration post-traumatic amnesia &lt; 20 day vs. &gt; 20 day ) . Each combination factor form stratum randomization allocate within stratum . GH Stimulation Test : After obtain informed consent , 18 - 20 g IV catheter place forearm vein . 5 ml blood sample baseline , afterwards L-arginine infuse 30 minute ( 100 mL NS , dose 0.5 g/kg maximum 30 g ) . Blood sample 30 , 60 , 90 minute start infusion L-arginine . All blood sample centrifuge serum frozen -20oC within 15 minute collection . All serum specimens assay glucose GH . Growth Hormone deficiency define peak response arginine infusion &lt; 1.4 ng/mL . Growth Hormone insufficiency define peak GH response &lt; For IGF-1 level , use age gender normative data base 3,961 healthy subject . 3 . Safety Assessments . Safety assess clinical evaluation 1 , 2 , 3 , 4.5 month initiate therapy . At evaluation participant caregiver ask possible adverse effect GH treatment , include fluid retention , paresthesia , joint stiffness , peripheral edema , arthralgia , myalgia . Additionally , blood obtain assessment glucose , free T4 , lipid profile , insulin level . The dose GH ( placebo ) adjust study physician depend occurrence severity adverse effect . 4 . Outcome Measures . Table 3 summarizes functional neuropsychologic test use assess outcome study . This battery measure develop NCMRR TBI Clinical Trials Network maximize power TBI clinical trial compare single measure alone . These measure design capture broad perspective functional cognitive parameter important follow TBI , utilizes scale long history TBI research . Further , convince evidence reliably administer 6 - 12 month injury . 5 . Biochemical test . Plasma GH IGF-1 level measure Clinical Contracts Research Laboratories UT Southwestern Medical Center ( CLIA ID No . 45D0659587 ) , use commercially-available immunoassay . This laboratory also carry safety lab assessment ( glucose , insulin , free T4 , lipid profile . Results available within 1 week allow randomization within time window , allow dose adjustment timely fashion . 6 . Statistical Analysis Sample size calculation . This Phase II study , design assess feasibility obtain information dose efficacy magnitude effect . There two feature study design relatively novel TBI clinical trial , merit introduction . The first use futility ( non-inferiority ) design , second use composite outcome statistic . The goal Phase II study provide information side effect toxicity type patient treatment intend , determine logistics administration , provide estimate treatment cost , obtain information expect effect size . For reason discuss , believe information yet available regard use rhGH early phase TBI , Phase II study design obtain information warrant . Drugs remain promising Phase II study generally proceed Phase III clinical trial , typically require many hundred patient usually conduct multiple center great expense . Futility design trial pioneer cancer chemotherapy study , recently use Phase II clinical trial neurological disorder Parkinson 's disease stroke . A traditionally design study focus efficacy , null hypothesis treatment arm equivalent . In study , assumption false positive result risky false negative result ( riskier falsely assume ineffective therapy work discard potentially effective treatment ) . In study , customary set alpha 0.05 ( likelihood false positive result le 5 % ) , beta 0.2 ( likelihood false negative result -- beneficial effect miss less 20 % ) . A futility design incorporate view early phase clinical development new therapy , fact risky discard potentially useful treatment fail definitively identify efficacy , since do phase III study . Thus , phase II futility study null hypothesis treatment promise therefore produce result exceed meaningful threshold . Thus , alpha 0.1 ( set study ) futility study mean chance beneficial effect miss less 10 % . In futility design , efficacy threshold met , null hypothesis reject study treatment consider futile42 . Thus , primary hypothesis , design study futility ( non-superiority ) study , power reject potentially useful therapy , rather prove efficacy . The second relatively novel feature study use composite outcome statistic . A composite outcome statistic take account fact complex disorder TBI , multiple domain dysfunction , single scale ( GOS-E give neuropsychometric test ) may optimally sensitive identify functionally important deficit patient . There several mathematical approach need compare two group respect one outcome . The option available include use Bonferroni adjustment multiple comparison , reduce dimension problem average outcome , apply global test base multiple correlated binary outcomes43,44 . Of , latter approach find useful variety clinical setting . Incorporating several different measure , although correlated measure different domain dysfunction TBI , significantly lower sample size require . We elect use composite outcome statistic develop NIH TBI Clinical Trials Network , use Citocholine Brain Injury Treatment ( COBRIT ) study . This measure develop subcommittee NIH network include clinician , neuropsychologists , biostatisticians , include Dr. Diaz-Arrastia Dr. Sureyya Dikmen ( serve DSMB trial ) . In study , use composite statistic lower sample size 228 164 . All participant GH treatment arm may achieve goal serum IGF-1 value first month , yet data analyze intention-to-treat manner . Primary Hypothesis : 1. . Treatment recombinant human Growth Hormone ( rhGH ) subacute period TBI result improve functional outcome 6 month injury , measure Composite Outcome Score TBI Clinical Trials Network . Secondary Hypotheses : 2. . Treatment rhGH result increase IGF-1 level . 3. . rhGH treatment result improve bone mineral density lean body mass 6 month injury . 4. . Benefits rhGH treatment persist 1 year injury 5. . Low GH response L-arginine stimulation baseline associate poor functional outcome . 6. . Low IGF-1 level baseline associate poor functional outcome . 7. . rhGH treatment effective patient low IGF-1 level baseline . 8. . rhGH treatment effective patient low GH response L-Arginine stimulation baseline .</detailed_description>
