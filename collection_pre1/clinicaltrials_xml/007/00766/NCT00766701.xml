	<brief_summary>The overall objective study evaluate whether fluorescence reflectance spectroscopy improve ability detect presence premalignant lesion cervix . The specific aim study : - To compare information obtain fluorescence reflectance spectroscopic measurement cervix standard method detect cervical pre-cancers . - To validate previously develop algorithms discriminate normal pre-cancerous tissue base spectroscopic measurement . - To evaluate safety spectroscopic measurement cervical tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree take part study , spectroscopic measurement cervix make research purpose , prior routine colposcopy examination . MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE : The doctor first place vaginal speculum perform LightTouch Ã Â® procedure ( look tissue cervix use light ) . The doctor use fresh single use contact tube ( tube attach LightTouch device help hold place ) apply gently cervix . This transmit light much like flashlight . The light either reflect bounce immediately cervix enter skin less second , return back LightTouch device . Each read take 5-7 minute , two reading may take . You may also ask repeat experimental test day , example 2 3 hour first test , part another experimental procedure study whether device give result twice row woman ( repeatability study ) . If agree second ( LightTouch ) procedure placement contact tube apply gently cervix another test take . This could take another 5 7 minute time . Whether agree one experimental test test , follow LightTouch experimental procedure ( ) , Pap smear endocervix ( doctor use small plastic brush remove cell endocervix canal ) . We also test human papilloma virus ( HPV ) . HPV virus sexually transmit associate abnormal Pap smear . The doctor use two separate vial test , one take Pap smear take cell HPV test . Once doctor take Pap smear HPV test . The doctor colposcopy exam use colposcope look cervix closely check abnormal area . The doctor also apply acetic acid Lugols require . The doctor may also perform biopsy ( remove one tissue sample 're cervix ) late examination pathologist . If consider necessary , ECC ( Endocervical Curettage scrap cell inside endocervix ) perform abnormal area see . A video image ( camera ) use capture location abnormal area compare reading spectroscopic image . Your overall study participation time approximately 30 minute . If ask participate second test agree , take place directly first test . The spectroscopy portion measurement take take 5 7 minute complete . If second study procedure take additional 15-30 minute make overall participation time 60 minute ( one hour ) . You may ask re-test one time visit information collect bad movement device work . The result LightTouch test compare result colposcopy biopsy . The result LightTouch test test use plan treatment . If biopsy result show abnormal change , doctor discus treatment option .</detailed_description>
