	<brief_title>Yttrium Microspheres With Cetuximab Plus Irinotecan Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer Mets Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Yttrium microspheres design treat cancer metastasize liver give radiation directly tumor . SIR-spheres design deliver radiation directly tumor . This radiation kill tumor cell . Cetuximab drug block epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . EGFR may involve certain type cancer , include non small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . When EGFR stimulate , series chemical reaction start result tumor `` tell '' grow . Cetuximab try stop reaction block EGFR . This may stop tumor grow . Irinotecan design block cell growth block enzyme repair DNA , building block cell . If agree take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1of 2 group . Participants one group receive SIR-spheres Cetuximab Irinotecan therapy . Participants group Cetuximab Irinotecan therapy without SIR-spheres . There equal chance assign either group . If find eligible take part study , blood vessel study ( give x-ray dye ) perform . This help researcher look artery lead liver surround area . You receive Versed Fentanyl , sedative drug put sleep , intravenously ( IV -- needle vein ) arm . A catheter place groin artery artery lead liver . A catheter sterile flexible tube place large artery local anesthesia IV sedation . Your physician explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . X-ray dye inject catheter . If randomly select receive SIR-Spheres Cetuximab Irinotecan therapy , small amount radioactive albumin injection ( part scan test use measure supply blood lung ) give liver . Images take learn much material ( radioactive particle ) show lung liver anatomy normal . If everything appear normal , yttrium microspheres give slowly catheter 1 dose . If liver anatomy abnormal , yttrium microspheres give slowly catheter 2 dos . After give yttrium microspheres , catheter remove , pressure apply groin stop bleeding . You monitor 6 hour check well . You give pain medication , need ( sedative drug use ) . You give standard dos Zantac ( ranitidine ) help protect stomach treatment . Chemotherapy cetuximab irinotecan give outpatient basis . A catheter ( PICC line , port-a-cath ) may insert vein arm chest ensure chemotherapy give without interruption . Irinotecan give IV 90 minute , every 3 week . Cetuximab give week . On Day 1 treatment , give test dose cetuximab , check allergic reaction . After , cetuximab give IV 2 hour . Before every dose cetuximab , give dose diphenhydramine IV , keep allergic reaction . You also receive medication prevent nausea , vomit , allergic reaction . You single-photon emission computerize tomography ( SPECT ) scan within 1 week treatment . A SPECT scan let doctor study function internal organ . You blood ( 2 tablespoon ) drawn every week first 2 month month outpatient basis . This researcher check function kidney liver . You also routine physical exam computerize tomography ( CT ) scan perform month check growth tumor . Researchers check see tumor respond study treatment look image CT scan every 8 week . You may take study disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , enough study drug supply continue treat disease . You followed-up telephone long cancer . This investigational study . Yttrium microspheres FDA approve hepatic arterial therapy treatment liver metastasis . Sir-Sphere therapy approve treating colorectal cancer liver metastasis . The combination cetuximab irinotecan FDA approve metastatic colorectal cancer . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma colon rectum . Histology hepatic metastasis mandatory morphological appearance cross sectional imaging tumor marker ( CEA ) indicative colorectal primary . 2 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure two dimension ( long diameter record ) great equal 20 mm conventional technique great equal 10 mm spiral CT scan . 3 . Patients must radiological evidence disease progression disease within 6 month recent dose chemotherapeutic regimen . 4 . Age great equal 18 year . 5 . ECOG performance status less equal 2 . 6 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define within 30 day receive investigational agent : leukocyte great equal 3,000/mL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mL platelet great equal 100,000/mL total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) less equal 3 X ULN ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3 X ULN Creatinine less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal institutional limit 7 . Patients prior history noncolorectal cancer active disease may eligible disease free great equal 12 month prior treatment . 8 . The effect SIRSpheres , irinotecan cetuximab develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason radiation well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant study , inform treat physician immediately . 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 10 . Patients without evidence local disease recurrence colorectal cancer eligible 11 . Patients extrahepatic disease confine lung permit &lt; 4 lesion depict CTand &lt; 3 cm size 12 . Patients brain mets eligible trial patient area surgically resect irradiated evidence active disease demonstrate MRI brain . Patients must evidence residual neurological dysfunction per baseline neurological exam . Patients untreated brain metastasis consider ineligible . 1 . Patients chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier exclude . Patients hepatic external beam radiotherapy exclude . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 3 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition SIRSpheres , irinotecan cetuximab agent use study . 4 . Evidence ascites , biopsy proven cirrhosis portal hypertension suggest presence characteristic imaging feature cross sectional imaging esophageal varicosity demonstrate endoscopy barium swallow . A diagnostic study rule presence portal hypertension require unless finding cross sectional imaging suggestive confirmatory . 5 . Hepatic arterial anatomy would prevent catheterization administration SIRSpheres liver . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection require hospital admission antibiotic , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( class III IV ) , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would exclude patient study . 7 . Contraindications angiography selective visceral catheterization : History severe allergy intolerance contrast medium , atropine . Bleeding diathesis , correctable usual form therapy would include medical coagulopathy limit administration blood product . 8 . Utilization capecitabine 6 week precede SIRSphere therapy indefinitely follow SIRSphere therapy per manufacturer 's recommendation due increase risk radiation hepatitis . 9 . Patients exhibit mutant variety kras exclude participation study .</criteria>
