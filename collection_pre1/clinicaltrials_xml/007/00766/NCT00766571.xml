	<brief_summary>This study explore medical problem patient VACTERL association identify gene change might responsible . VACTERL association affect many part body , include bone spine , heart , low intestinal tract , connection trachea esophagus , kidney arm . Information study may lead good understanding disease improve treatment genetic counseling . Patients VACTERL association parent sibling may eligible study . Patients admit NIH Clinical Center evaluation 3 4 day may include follow procedure : - Physical examination , medical history , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , blood urine test - Eye examination - Imaging study ( echocardiogram , x-rays ultrasound test ) - Other specialized test consultation indicate - Optional medical photograph face body part may involve VACTERL association publication scientific text teaching purpose - Optional return visit 2 year repeat test look change time Parents patient follow procedure : - Physical examination , medical history , blood test x-ray , need - Specialty consultation indicate - Optional medical photograph face body part may involve VACTERL association publication scientific text teaching purpose - Questionnaires child medical history , growth , behavior development , therapy medication Siblings patient follow procedure : - Physical examination , medical history blood test</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The combination vertebral defect , anal atresia , cardiac anomaly , tracheo-esophageal fistula , radial dysplasia limb anomaly , renal anomaly , term VACTERL association , use clinical descriptor specific group phenotypic manifestation observe occur together . Depending upon diagnostic criterion use , prevalence may high 1 6000 live birth . VACTERL association felt due defect early embryogenesis , likely genetically heterogeneous . The purpose present study increase understand clinical manifestation genetic cause VACTERL association detail physical , laboratory , radiological study . We also plan examine spectrum clinical characteristic VACTERL association facilitate early diagnosis clinical management , include genetic counseling . To accomplish , plan enroll approximately 25-50affected individual along family member total 75-150 total individual year , enrollment ceiling 500 affected individual . Patients family see NIH clinical center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : ( A ) For affected individual , determination clinical criterion inclusion determine prior medical record review participation . Inclusion criterion may meet 1 3 way : 1 . At least 3 feature VACTERL association index case OR 2 . Two feature VACTERL association index case plus least 1 feature VACTERL association relative OR 3 . At least 2 feature VACTERL association index case plus least 1 anomaly . ( B ) First degree relative ( parent and/or sibling affected individual ) patient VACTERL association also eligible participate portion protocol even feature VACTERL association . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Anyone unwilling provide inform consent ( adult , behalf child minor , behalf adult unable provide consent ) assent . 2 . Cases clearly spectrum VACTERL association relate direct research interest ( e.g . refer VACTERL case felt related syndrome , Feingold syndrome , TownesBrocks syndrome , PallisterHall syndrome , would include ) . In instance , would attempt make referral appropriate investigator .</criteria>
