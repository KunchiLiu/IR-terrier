	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Hydromorphone Oral Osmotic System ( OROS ) Korean Participants With Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , multi-center ( conducted 1 center ) , prospective ( study follow participant forward time ) dose-ascending study evaluate clinical usefulness hydromorphone OROS improvement sleep disturbance cause cancer pain.Total duration study 3 week . The study consist 3 phase : Screening phase ( 1 week ) , Treatment phase ( 2 week ) , Extension phase ( 12 week ) . The study include 6 visit : Day -7 , Day 1 , Day 15 , Day 43 , Day 71 , Day 99 . During screen phase , potential participant receive strong oral ( long acting ) opioid analgesic ( 7 day ) Day 1 participant evaluate participation clinical study Day 1 . During treatment phase , participant receive hydromorphone OROS ( 8 milligram [ mg ] great equal 32 mg ) , daily 2 week , dose adjust every 2 day Day 3 Investigator 's discretion accord strong oral ( long acting ) opioid analgesic administer screening phase Day 1 ( initial dose study drug determine convert dose previously administer analgesic daily dose oral morphine equivalent analgesic effect study drug [ dose equivalent analgesic effect ; Hydromorphone OROS dose : oral morphine dose =1:5 ] ) . Participants complete treatment phase suffer continue cancer pain enrol extension phase study drug administer per Investigator discretion 99 day . Participants primarily evaluate improvement sleep disturbance measure Korean Brief Pain Inventory ( KBPI ) . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
