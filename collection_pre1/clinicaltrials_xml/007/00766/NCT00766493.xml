	<brief_title>GORE® Embolic Filter Carotid Stenting High Risk Surgical Subjects ( EMBOLDEN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous advance angioplasty technique development low-profile , flexible , tapered nitinol stent design specifically carotid application make CAS viable alternative CEA . Advances embolic protection technology assist move CAS forward universally accepted procedure . While GORE® Embolic Filter similar many way currently available filter , design provide optimal vessel wall apposition . Bench test suggest wall apposition may provide improved filter efficiency , thereby minimize embolization particle downstream potentially decrease adverse clinical effect . In addition , preclinical test suggest GORE® Embolic Filter improve deliverability , include torque ability lesion cross may improve ability system access treat tight lesion tortuous anatomy . Thus , purpose multi-center clinical study ass safety effectiveness GORE® Embolic Filter use provide cerebral embolic protection carotid artery angioplasty stenting .</detailed_description>
