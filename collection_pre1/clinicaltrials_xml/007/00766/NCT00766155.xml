	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy use 3-dimensional image tumor help focus thin beam radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell few side effect . Giving chemotherapy together radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether capecitabine effective without oxaliplatin treat patient rectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give chemotherapy together radiation therapy surgery follow capecitabine without oxaliplatin see well work treat patient locally advanced rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy Before Surgery Followed Capecitabine With Without Oxaliplatin Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Investigate whether addition oxaliplatin neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy adjuvant chemotherapy comprise capecitabine improves disease-free survival patient locally advanced rectal cancer . Secondary - Compare overall survival patient locally advanced rectal cancer treat neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy adjuvant chemotherapy comprise capecitabine versus without oxaliplatin . - Determine loco-regional failure distant failure patient treat regimen . - Determine pathological down-staging ( ypT0-2N0 ) patient treat regimen . - Determine pathological complete remission ( yp T0N0 ) rate patient treat regimen . - Determine tumor progression grade histopathological R0 resection patient treat regimen . - Determine sphincter preservation rate patient treat regimen . - Determine perioperative complication rate regimens patient . - Determine toxicity regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord treat center , clinical T category ( T1-3 v T4 ) , clinical nodal status ( Nx vs NO v N1-2 ) , distance tumor anal verge ( ≤ 5 cm v &gt; 5 cm ) method locoregional staging ( EUS+MRI v EUS+CTscan v MRI alone ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( control ) : - Neoadjuvant therapy : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-35 . Patients also undergo concurrent 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 5 day week day 1-33 follow surgery . Patients may receive additional chemoradiotherapy day 36-38 . - Adjuvant therapy : Beginning 4-8 week surgery , patient receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-15 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( investigational ) : - Neoadjuvant therapy : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily undergo concurrent 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 5 day week day 1-33 . Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 prior radiotherapy follow surgery . Patients may receive additional chemoradiotherapy day 36-38 . - Adjuvant therapy : Beginning 4-8 week surgery , patient receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-15 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
