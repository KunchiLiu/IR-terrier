	<brief_summary>Influenza common infection upper airway lung , cause virus . Cancer patient may need strong influenza vaccine general population protect influenza . The experimental vaccine design 9 time strong standard vaccine , may cause strong immune response influenza patient weaken immune system . The goal study compare effect new experimental influenza vaccine effect standard influenza vaccine . One hundred bone marrow recipient , adult volunteer MD Anderson Cancer Center , 18 year age old , participate study . They randomly ( chance ) assign receive 2 dos either standard licensed influenza vaccine experimental influenza vaccine . Participants ask complete 5 study visit 3 telephone contact . Study procedure include blood draw . The duration participation 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) patient immunocompromised vary degree depend upon genetic relationship donor recipient compromise therapy require allogeneic transplant . Responses influenza vaccine population poor yet influenza virus infection lead serious disease . There need prophylaxis influenza population . One approach improve immune response influenza vaccine BMT patient could increase dosage number dose vaccine . This approach increase response variety population . Moreover , use purify hemagglutinin ( HA ) vaccine form rDNA-expressed HA protein baculovirus expression system increase immune response without increase reactogenicity . Researchers hypothesize increase dosage 2 dos purify influenza vaccine increase serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) neutralize antibody response significantly follow 2 dos conventional vaccine BMT patient . The primary objective study determine 2 dos baculovirus-expressed recombinant trivalent influenza vaccine contain approximately 135 mcg per HA result significantly high proportion subject achieve Day 28 Day 56 post vaccination increase serum HAI neutralize antibody titer see immunization standard dose license trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine immunosuppressed allogeneic HSCT ( hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ) recipient . The secondary objective determination safety tolerability two-dose regimen recombinant , baculovirus-expressed HA contain approximately 135 mcg per HA administer intramuscular injection patient follow allogeneic HSCT , comparison geometric mean titer ( GMT ) serum HAI neutralize antibody 3 virus strain contain vaccine . The study enroll 100 adult ( great equal 18 year age ) allogeneic HSCT recipients 6 12 month follow bone marrow transplantation , stable chronic graft-versus-host disease , evaluate outpatient BMT clinic M.D . Anderson Cancer Center . Subjects randomize receive either licensed trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) baculovirus-expressed recombinant trivalent hemagglutinin vaccine ( rHA0 ) . All injection administer deltoid muscle . Subjects randomize ( 50 per group ) receive vaccination Day 0 second dose 4 week later . Subjects observe clinic least 20 minute inoculation , subject maintain memory aid record oral temperature solicit systemic local adverse event ( AE ) 8 day ( Day 0 Day 7 ) immunization . Subjects see Day 2 Day 30 ( 1-5 day vaccination ) arm check , vital sign , assessment possible AEs , concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination indicate . Subjects contact phone Day 8 Day 36 ( 7-10 day vaccination ) review memory aid ass possible AEs serious ( S ) AEs . Subjects return clinic Day 28 AE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination indicate , review memory aid prior receive second dose vaccine . Serum vaccine immunogenicity evaluation collect prior vaccination Days 0 28 , 56 day first vaccine dose . Participants involve study related procedure 6 month .</detailed_description>
