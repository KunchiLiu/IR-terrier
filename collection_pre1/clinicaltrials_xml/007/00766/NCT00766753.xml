	<brief_summary>This single-institution Phase I/II study design evaluate safety induction immune response , preliminary clinical response vaccination Type-1 alpha-DCs ( alpha-DC1 ) load glioma-associated antigen ( GAA ) epitopes administration poly-ICLC patient recurrent malignant glioma . Approximately 30 subject enrol study UPMC/UPCI Hillman Cancer Center . The study participant trial HLA-A2 positive male female adult 18 year age . The primary objective establish safety approach . The endpoint determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) alpha-DC1 vaccine combination fix dose poly-ICLC , use standard criterion close clinical followup . The secondary objective 1 ) assess immunological response GAAs patient recurrent malignant glioma immunize DCs load GAA-derived peptide use enzyme-linked immuno-spot ( ELISPOT ) , delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) tetramer assay ; 2 ) ass preliminary anti-tumor clinical activity vaccine measure radiological response ( MRI ) , overall survival , 4- 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-institution Phase I/II study design evaluate safety , induction immune response , preliminary clinical response vaccination Type-1 αDCs ( αDC1 ) load glioma-associated antigen ( GAA ) epitopes administration poly-ICLC patient recurrent malignant glioma . The hypothesis form vaccine combination poly-ICLC treatment prove safe , induce potent anti-glioma immune response . The primary objective establish safety approach . The secondary objective 1 ) assess immunological response GAAs patient recurrent malignant glioma immunize DCs load GAA-derived peptide use enzyme-linked immuno-spot ( ELISPOT ) , delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) tetramer assay 2 ) ass preliminary anti-tumor clinical activity vaccine measure radiological response ( MRI ) , overall survival , four- six-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) .</detailed_description>
