	<brief_summary>This study measure nasopharyngeal pressure neonates use miniature high resolution catheter-tip pressure transducer . Any neonatal intensive care patient treat nasal respiratory support ( e.g. , nasal continuous positive airway pressure , nasal cannula flow either high ( &gt; 1 LPM ) low ( &lt; 1 LPM ) , nasal prong ventilation either intermittent mandatory high-frequency ) eligible study . The catheter-tip transducer place within standard gavage feed tube catheter introduce mouth posterior nasopharynx continuous measurement make 15 minute . The 15 minute record divide 5 three minute segment , include baseline recording order setting pressure flow , record 1 level baseline , record back baseline , record 1 level baseline , final segment back baseline . The order increase-decrease decrease-increase baseline random sequence . Measurements may repeat change nasal gas flow pressure order patient care . These measurement use correlate order nasal respiratory support therapy actual upper airway pressure create therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-invasive respiratory treatment use frequently neonatal intensive care . High-flow nasal cannula,1-2 nasal continuous positive airway pressure,3 nasal intermittent mandatory synchronize ventilation,4 high-frequency nasal continuous airway pressure5-6 modality . These non-invasive therapy attempt provide adequate oxygen delivery , positive end-expiratory pressure maintain lung recruitment , ventilation assistance without need endotracheal intubation . The benefit may substantial , include decreased frequency nosocomial infection , decrease risk lung injury , prevention arrest pulmonary development preterm infant immature lung . However , report actual measurement nasopharyngeal pressure use non-invasive therapies.1,7 Combined , 27 patient include two study . Only one modality , high-flow nasal cannula , evaluate . One study 11 patient suggest 2-3 cmH2O pressure drop exist apply delivered airway pressure.7 In order well understand relationship apply deliver airway pressure type non-invasive therapy , propose measure nasopharyngeal pressure neonate treat mode respiratory support . If non-invasive respiratory support initiate part routine pulmonary therapy neonate admit neonatal intensive care , infant consider eligible study exclusion criterion meet . Informed consent/parental permission request obtain , infant include study . The study procedure follow : - Care information document , include infant 's post-menstrual post-delivery age , current weight , current level supplemental oxygen administration , current pulse oximeter saturation level , apply flow pressure setting , non-invasive ventilation use , ventilator parameter . - A high resolution fiber optic pressure tip transducer catheter insert 5F similar size fenestrated tube ( Anderson catheter ) introduce mouth towards posterior pharynx . The pressure transducer/catheter combination insert minimum distance obtain stable pressure signal reading produce choke gag infant . If infant demonstrate choke gag , tube withdrawn position produce choke gag infant . If pressure signal suggests catheter opening may occlude mucous , 5mL air may inject catheter clear mucous obtain satisfactory recording . - A 1 5 minute record make pressure transducer onto notebook computer current non-invasive therapy setting . - Two 1 5 minute recording make , either 0.5-1.0 cmH2O 0.5-1.0 liter per minute flow ( depend non-invasive modality ) current setting . The order increase decrease random sequence . - A final fourth 1 5 minute record make setting return current baseline setting . - Pulse oximeter saturation record recording . - A study infant undergo baseline study procedure , re-studied whenever non-invasive therapy setting change base clinical management .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Any infant admit neonatal intensive care treat modality noninvasive respiratory support , low high flow nasal cannula ; nasal prong , catheter mask continuous distending pressure ; nasal ventilation either intermittent mandatory , synchronize high frequency eligible study . Patients oral , nasal , palatal deformity otherwise fit cannula mask exclude study .</criteria>
