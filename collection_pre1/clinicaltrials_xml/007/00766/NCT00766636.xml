	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To assess margin positive resection rate ( R1 resection rate ; define `` tumor within 2 mm surgical margin final pathology report '' ) patient treat preoperative chemotherapy ( gemcitabine erlotinib ) without external-beam radiation therapy follow pancreaticoduodenectomy adenocarcinoma pancreatic head . Secondary Objectives : - To assess disease free survival - To assess overall survival - To assess pattern local distant failure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Chemotherapy ( Gemcitabine Erlotinib ) With Without Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Gemcitabine design disrupt growth cancer cell , may cause cancer cell die . Erlotinib design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . Screening Tests : Signing consent form mean able take part study . You `` screen test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . The following test procedure perform : - You complete physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test woman able child . To take part study , pregnancy test must negative . - You ask side effect may experience . - Urine collect routine test . - You chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) scan abdomen check status disease . The study doctor discus screen test result . If screening test show eligible take part study , enrol . Other treatment option discuss . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) receive either chemotherapy without radiation ( Group A ) chemotherapy radiation ( Group B ) . You equal chance either group . Pre-Surgery Study Drug Administration : - If Group A , receive gemcitabine 90 minute 1 time week ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 [ +/- 2 Days ] . You take erlotinib mouth , water , 1 hour eat 2 hour eat 1 time daily Days 1-42 . - If Group B , receive gemcitabine 40 minute 1 time week ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , [ +/- 2 Days ] ) . You take erlotinib mouth , water , 1 hour eat 2 hour eat 1 time daily Days 1-42 . You also receive radiation therapy 1 time day 5 day row ( Monday Friday ) 5 1/2 week start Day 1 . You sign separate consent form radiation therapy . If day radiation therapy miss , make miss day ( ) end therapy receive full amount radiation therapy . Post-Surgery Study Drug Administration : For participant , start within 12 week surgery , receive gemcitabine 100 minute Days 1 , 8 , 15 [ +/- 2 Days ] ) 4 week cycle . You also take erlotinib mouth water 1 hour eat 2 hour eat 1 time daily 4 week . You may able receive postoperative therapy closer home outside cancer doctor . This treat cancer doctor M. D. Anderson . A research nurse contact least every week telephone . Participants need radiation treatment allow receive radiation treatment M. D. Anderson Cancer Center . Surgery : All participant chest x-rays CT scan perform approximately 4 week last dose study drug combination check status disease . If disease gotten bad , study doctor think best interest , schedule surgery remove pancreas duodenum . You sign separate consent form surgery . If find eligible surgery , participation study end time . Length Study : You take study early disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , study doctor think longer best interest continue receive study drug . You remain study approximately 10 month . Follow-Up Visit : After participation study complete , chest x-ray CT scan every 4 month 2 year . This investigational study . Gemcitabine Erlotinib FDA commercially available , use together radiation therapy investigational . Up 190 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
