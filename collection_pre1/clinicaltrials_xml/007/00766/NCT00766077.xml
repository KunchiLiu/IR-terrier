	<brief_summary>Stress fracture common debilitate injury variety athletes however current evidence clearly allow easy prediction athlete risk first fracture . Animal preliminary human evidence suggest assessment bone strength , muscle size run mechanic may primary risk factor stress fracture . The investigator study help determine , , modifiable risk factor could help identify athlete risk stress fracture . Competitive female distance runner recruit study . Participants place stress fracture control group base stress fracture history . Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography ( pQCT ) use assess bone structure strength . Running mechanic assess 30-40 minute fatigue run . A treadmill embed force plate high speed video use assess change run mechanic throughout run . The purpose project 1. explore difference volumetric bone mineral density ( vBMD ) , bone geometry , muscle cross sectional area ( MCSA ) use pQCT 2. explore change load ( GRFs ) run mechanic occur fatigue run runner without history stress fracture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stress fracture among prevalent sport injury , particularly sport involve running , jumping , repetitive cyclic loading . Stress fracture diagnose many 20 % athlete . The high prevalence stress fracture among athlete report member track field team rate 10-31 % ( 22 ) . Stress fracture also common occurrence military basic training . U.S. military report recruit population indicate incidence rate 0.2 4 % men , 1 7 % woman ( 1 ) . Due prevalence stress fracture military athletic population , well costly nature injury term recovery time , important understand causative factor mean factor relate interact ( 25 , 29 ) . The commonly study measure risk factor stress fracture surrogates bone strengthâ€”particularly bone mineral density . Although several previous study explore relationship areal bone mineral density ( aBMD , g/cm2 ) stress fracture , finding remain controversial ( 6 , 7 , 9 , 12 , 17 , 28 ) . A majority study use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) aBMD assessment bone strength . DXA limit 2-dimensional assessment 3-dimensional bone also unable distinguish different type bone ( 13 , 30 ) . Given limitation DXA imaging , measure bone property use peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography ( pQCT ) may shed light inconsistency find current literature . Peripheral QCT 3-dimensional imaging technique allow measurement trabecular cortical volumetric bone density , bone geometry ( total area , cortical area ) , estimate bone mechanical strength ( i.e . cross-sectional moment inertia section modulus ) well represent bone mechanical competence ( 26 , 31 ) . With fracture , bone fail load bone high strength bone . In case stress fracture , suggest risk stress fracture may alter biomechanics fatigue strain bone increase fatigue cause increase microdamage ultimate fracture . Research measure kinetic kinematic variable show change GRFs ( 10 , 11 , 16 , 19 , 21 ) , strain magnitude , strain rate , strain distribution ( 8 , 14 , 15 , 24 ) , land strategy onset muscle fatigue healthy individual . It also show muscle fatigue , ability absorb impact force land , internal timing ability function muscle group , ability counter bend moment decrease ( 2-5 , 18 , 20 , 23 ) . It hypothesize runner ineffective alter movement kinematics experience great increase load rate impact magnitude , make susceptible injury runner able make appropriate alteration ( 16 ) . However , majority study conduct rest condition athlete history injury . No previous study knowledge adequately characterize change biomechanics fatigue run athlete without history stress fracture .</detailed_description>
