	<brief_summary>The purpose project prove Imp™SFB7+ ( L-Dex U400 ) equivalent Imp™ XCA device assess Lymphoedema . The Imp™ XCA device simple device capable assess Lymphoedema single arm . The Imp™SFB7+ ( L-Dex U400 ) complex device capable assess Lymphoedema large population Lymphoedema sufferer . The Imp™SFB7+ ( L-Dex U400 ) develop assess patient Lymphoedema arm leg . The Imp™ XCA Imp™ SFB7 TGA approve device . The Imp™ SFB7+ ( L-Dex U400 ) similar Imp™ SFB7 change software user interface .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Equivalency Imp SFB7+ ( L-Dex U400 ) With Imp XCA Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When Lymphoedema present , lymph fluid build interstitial space tissue . This result overall increase total amount extracellular fluid ( ECF ) limb , cause swell . This document measure impedance ( opposition ) low frequency current pass limb . Low frequency current travel predominantly ECF , Lymphoedema manifest . As fluid build limb , impedance current decrease way low frequency bioimpedance able ass Lymphoedema . Multi-frequency bio-impedance analysis otherwise know Bioimpedance Spectroscopy ( BIS ) report effective measurement ECF sub clinical change ECF predict onset Lymphoedema arm study conduct Cornish et al . It report Warren et al BIS use reliable accurate tool document presence lymphoedema patient wither upper- lower-extremity swelling . The Imp™ XCA device use `` impedance ratio '' methodology assess unilateral Lymphoedema arm . By method unaffected arm act internal subject specific control . The Imp SFB7+ ( L-Dex U400 ) use principle low frequency . This study design show equivalence 2 device assess unilateral Lymphoedema arm .</detailed_description>
