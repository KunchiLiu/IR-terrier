	<brief_summary>This study determine drug call sirolimus safe give people geographic atrophy GA help preserve vision patient . GA advance form dry age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . AMD affect macula , central part retina need sharp , clear vision . There two type AMD , wet dry . In dry AMD , cell macula die.GA may least partly cause inflammation . Sirolimus help prevent inflammation therefore may help treat GA. People GA eye visual acuity 20/20 20/400 eye may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Sirolimus injection study eye 3-month clinic visit . The drug inject out layer eye patient receive antiseptic numb drop . Antibiotic drop continue 2 day injection . - Eye examination first injection , 1 month first injection , clinic visit ( 11 15 visit 2 3 year ) 3 month final injection . The examination include test visual acuity , measure eye pressure check eye movement . To examine inside eye , pupil dilate eye drop . Regular photograph inside eye optical coherence tomography photograph , allow measurement thickness retina , may take eye examination . - Autofluorescence imaging . The patient sits chair head place chin rest front camera . A light camera use scan eye . - Blood test . Blood drawn first visit seven study visit check blood chemistry , liver kidney function . - Urine pregnancy test woman able become pregnant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluation Subconjunctival Sirolimus Treatment Bilateral GA Associated With AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , lead cause blindness people age 55 United States , heterogeneous clinical entity retinal degeneration occur predominantly macula context age lead impairment central visual acuity . AMD occur two general form , one involve choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) subsequent formation disciform scar . This often referred neovascular `` wet '' form . A second form , subject study , term `` dry '' atrophic macular degeneration involve constellation clinical feature include drusen , pigment clump and/or retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) dropout geographic atrophy ( GA ) . GA begin thin RPE involvement underlie choriocapillaris lead subsequently atrophic change macula . Inflammation may play role pathogenesis GA. Sirolimus inhibit production , signal activity many inflammatory factor relevant development GA . Therefore , objective study investigate safety possible efficacy multiple sirolimus subconjunctival injection participant bilateral GA. Study Population : Ten participant bilateral GA associate AMD , potential replace five participant fail reach one year follow-up . Design : In control , unmasked , Phase I/II study , one eye eligible participant randomize treatment fellow eye observe . Participants receive 20 μL ( 440 μg ) subconjunctival injection sirolimus study eye baseline every three month thereafter . The study complete participant receive two year study medication follow-up . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome rate change area GA , base mask grading external Reading Center , fundus photography study eye fellow eye two year compare baseline . Secondary outcome include worsen best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) three line ( 15 letter ) , change area GA measure autofluorescence , change drusen volume measure optical coherence tomography , change photoreceptor outer segment ( PROS ) thickness measure optical coherence tomography , well change drusen area base masked digital grading fundus photograph . Safety outcomes include number severity systemic ocular toxicity , adverse event infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Participant must older 55 year age . 2 . Participant must understand sign protocol 's informed consent document . 3 . Participant must least ½ disc area ( approximately 1 mm^2 ) GA compatible AMD present eye . GA define one welldefined , usually less circular patch partial complete depigmentation RPE , typically exposure underlie choroidal blood vessel . Even much RPE appear preserve large choroidal vessel visible , round patch RPE partial depigmentation may still classify early GA . The GA eye must able photographed entirety . 4 . Participant must least one large druse ( equal 125 μm ) eye . 5 . Participant must steady fixation eye foveal parafoveal area medium clear enough good quality photograph . This permit randomization . 6 . Participant must visual acuity 20/20 20/400 eye . 7 . Female participant must consider postmenopausal must breastfeed . Female participant age 55 period one year consider postmenopausal . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Participant another investigational study actively receive study therapy . 2 . Participant unable comply study procedure followup visit . 3 . Participant evidence ocular disease AMD either eye may confound outcome study ( e.g. , diabetic retinopathy 10 hemorrhage microaneurysms , uveitis , pseudovitelliform macular degeneration moderate/severe myopia ) . 4 . Participant follow : ) history macular laser , b ) history photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , c ) receive intravitreal injection antivascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) agent wet/exudative AMD point , ) receive intravitreal injection agent ( antiVEGF agent ) within four month prior study enrollment e ) receive topical treatment agent advance AMD within one month prior enrollment . Participants currently take previously take AREDS vitamin supplementation exclude . 5 . Participant vitrectomy . 6 . Participant expect need ocular surgery course trial . 7 . Participant undergone lens removal last three month yttrium aluminum garnet ( YAG ) laser capsulotomy within last month . 8 . Participant chemotherapy . 9 . Participant immunosuppressive medication . 10 . Participant ocular systemic medication know toxic lens , retina optic nerve . 11 . Participant history ocular herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) . 12 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . 13 . History cancer ( nonmelanoma skin cancer ) diagnose within past five year . 14 . Laboratory value outside normal limit consider clinically significant investigator . 15 . Participant currently take one follow drug : amprenavir , atazanavir , clarithromycin , darunavir , delavirdine , erythromycin , fluconazole ( dose 200 mg great ) , fluvoxamine , indinavir , itraconazole , ketoconazole , nefazodone , nelfinavir , posaconazole , quinupristin , ritonavir , saquinavir , telithromycin , troleandomycin , verapamil voriconazole .</criteria>
