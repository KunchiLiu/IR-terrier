	<brief_summary>Available data randomize trial thrombectomy patient ST-elevation myocardial infarction show favourable trend myocardial reperfusion . Better myocardial reperfusion may translate good late clinical outcome . However , data available impact thrombectomy long term clinical outcome . Thus , investigator design collaborative individual patient-data pooled-analysis aim assess long-term clinical outcome STEMI patient randomize percutaneous coronary intervention without thrombectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Available data randomize trial thrombectomy patient ST-elevation myocardial infarction show favourable trend myocardial reperfusion . However , data available impact thrombectomy long term clinical outcome.The first trial thrombectomy small sample size short follow-up reliably assess presence clinical benefit . Only one , recently publish , monocentric , randomized trial conduct 1071 patient STEMI , TAPAS study , show advantage thrombus-aspiration use term mortality one year follow-up . To extend investigation issue large population , design pooled analysis individual patient data prospective randomize trial compare standard PCI without thrombectomy evaluate impact thrombectomy use long term clinical outcome . Methods : After thorough database search , 15 principal investigator 17 randomized trial compare thrombectomy standard PCI patient STEMI contact . All 10 principal investigator author 11 randomized trial agree participate study ask complete structured database include series key baseline clinical angiographic data ( sex , age , diabetes , rescue PCI , usage IIb/IIIa-inhibitors , infarct relate artery ( LAD LCX RCA ) , multivessel disease , base-line TIMI flow 0 1 ( yes ) , time symptom balloon/cath-lab , thrombectomy device use ( name device , example Export catheter ) , device efficacy ( device able reach treat culprit lesion ) ) also update clinical follow-up patient enrol corresponding trial one year . Actually close data collection request data update clinical follow-up data 11 randomized study ( REMEDIA trial , PIHRATE trial , X-AMINE ST trial , De Luca et al . trial , Noel et al . trial , EXPIRA trial , VAMPIRE trial , TAPAS trial , Kaltoft et al . trial , DEAR-MI trial , Antoniucci et al . trial ) . The primary end point pool analysis comparison survival patient randomize PCI thrombectomy PCI without thrombectomy . The secondary end-points survival free myocardial infarction ( MI ) , target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) , major adverse coronary event ( MACE : death + MI + TLR ) death + MI patient randomize PCI thrombectomy PCI without thrombectomy . A pre-defined subgroup analysis plan consider follow variable : diabetes , rescue PCI , IIb/IIIa-inhibitors use , time-to-reperfusion , infarct related artery , pre-PCI TIMI flow type thrombectomy device use . Implications : This study able provide useful data impact report improved myocardial perfusion associate thrombectomy long-term clinical outcome patient STEMI .</detailed_description>
