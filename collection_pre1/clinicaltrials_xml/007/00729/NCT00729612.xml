	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation give together carboplatin work treat patient stage IIIB , stage IV , recurrent non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine response rate , term overall response rate ( complete response partial response ) , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation carboplatin patient stage IIIB-IV recurrent non-small cell lung cancer ineligible treatment bevacizumab . Secondary - To evaluate safety regimen patient . - To describe overall survival patient . - To describe progression-free survival patient . Tertiary Objectives - To explore , pilot fashion , activity regimen use predictive biomarkers include serum SPARC level , methylation SPARC primary tumor sample serum , Ras mutation , ERCC1 SPARC immunohistochemistry , serum miRNA expression profile . OUTLINE : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute carboplatin IV 1-2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Paraffin-embedded tissue block unstained slide blood sample collect correlative study . Samples analyze serum SPARC ELISA , Ras mutation , ERCC1 AND SPARC immunohistochemistry , serum miRNA expression profiling . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
