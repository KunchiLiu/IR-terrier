Pregabalin Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) medication approve United States treatment nerve pain related diabetes post-herpetic neuralgia `` shingle '' , seizures adult . The purpose research study effect oral Pregabalin spinal neurotransmitter subject undergoing Total Knee Replacement Surgery ( TKA ) . TKA associate considerable postoperative pain unrelieved may result prolonged hospital stay , inability participate rehabilitation program , poor outcome , great use health-care resource .

	<brief_title>Effect Oral Pregabalin Spinal Neurotransmitters Patients Undergoing Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gabapentin related potent compound pregabalin show reduce postoperative pain animal model ( 1 ) . Pregabalin give surgery reduce opioid use follow spinal fusion surgery ( 2 ) . Studies identify alpha 2 delta auxiliary subunit voltage-gated calcium channel molecular target pregabalin ( gabapentin ) , although specific spinal site action ( presynaptic , postsynaptic ) know . Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) prove successful surgical treatment knee joint affect osteoarthritis . Currently United States , 400,000 TKAs perform every year report success rate range 85 % 90 % ( American Academy ) . In age population , number annual TKA procedure expect reach 3.48 million year 2030 ( 3 ) . TKA associate considerable postoperative pain unrelieved may result prolonged hospital stay , inability participate rehabilitation program , poor outcome , great use health-care resource . Perioperative pregabalin improve postoperative outcome TKA ( 4 ) . This study examine effect pregabalin administer perioperatively TKA pain-related neurotransmitter concentration , intrathecal analgesic consumption range motion ( ROM ) . Pregabalin effect neurotransmitter concentration may identify pathway α2δ bind pregabalin reduces postoperative pain . Objectives : Primary Endpoint : Measure effect pregabalin spinal neurotransmitter TKA Secondary Endpoint : Correlate change spinal neurotransmitter pregabalin improvement patient outcome TKA ( e.g . ROM ) . Other Endpoints : Suggest spinal anatomical site action oral pregabalin relate neurotransmitter modulation pain . Methods : Patient selection After approval Institutional Review Board Rush University Medical Center , Chicago , Illinois , USA , 48 patient schedule undergo elective primary TKA single orthopedic surgeon contact assessed study eligibility screen medical history . A study consent form send patient agree participate clinical study . After obtain consent , patient allocate study number study drug dispense participant . Using random number table , patient allocate one three group , without stratification demographic characteristic : Group 1 ( n=16 , multi-dose pregabalin ) : patient receive pregabalin 150 mg orally 1 hour prior surgery repeat 150 mg dose 12 24 hour initial dose . Group 2 ( n=16 , single dose pregabalin ) : patient receive pregabalin 150 mg orally 1 hour prior surgery , placebo dose 12 24 hour initial dose . Group 3 ( n=16 , placebo ) : patient receive match placebo 3 time point Groups 1 2 . The 12 hour dose interval base pharmacokinetic study show 300 mg oral pregabalin dose , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) pregabalin concentration reach peak 8 h later ( 5 ) . Study drug administration day surgery time precede surgical incision 60 +/- 30 minute . The physician nurse manage patient surgery recovery room , personnel involve postoperative pain assessment management intrathecal infusion , study patient blind group assignment . Treatment assignment code available investigator patient complete study . A global pain score use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 0 correspond `` pain '' 10 `` bad imaginable pain '' patient obtain surgery . In operating room , patient sedate midazolam ( 0.05 mg/kg titrate effect ) intrathecal catheter place sit position , L3-4 L4-5 vertebral level deliver spinal anesthesia bupivacaine 0.5 % , ( 7.5 mg ) fentanyl 25mcg . Subjects maintain normothermia operating room . A sensory analgesic level T10 obtain prior commencement surgery . At completion surgery intrathecal infusion fentanyl 0.5 mcg/ml bupivacaine 0.1 mg/ml initiate use continuous basal infusion superimpose patient control intrathecal analgesia ( PCIA ) bolus dos . Initial infusion rate 4 ml/h basal intrathecal infusion plus PCIA 1 ml q 12 min 4-hour lockout 40 ml . The patient instruct prior surgery use PCIA mode discretion maintain VAS pain score &lt; 4 , follow previously apply protocol ( 6 ) . A standardized surgical technique use subject . The intrathecal catheter leave place 32 h postoperatively provide analgesia , lumbar CSF ( 0.5 ml ) withdrawn ( 0.5 mL ) 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 32 h initial oral dose . CSF frozen -80 Centigrade ( C ) subsequent assay neurotransmitter level . Even though CSF pregabalin reach peak concentration least 8 h oral dose , early time point important : 1 . Even 2 h post-dose CSF pregabalin concentration already 29 % peak value , may cause change neurotransmitter level , compare placebo . 2 . CSF inflammatory mediator , Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , increase early 3 h start surgery total hip arthroplasty ( 7 ) , expect neurotransmitter level also show early change due TKA surgery alone . Any characterization pregabalin effect neurotransmitter surgery need also measure early change neurotransmitter level , since late time point ( e.g . 24 h ) independent event occur earlier . Adverse Events : Any adverse event note report .</detailed_description>
