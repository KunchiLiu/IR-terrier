	<detailed_description>Recent epidemiologic study re-ignited old controversy opinion form whether mucus hypersecretion crucial etiology airway disease . For patient asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , cystic fibrosis , mucus hypersecretion consider risk factor increase morbidity . The irritant epithelial membrane effect O3 , main component urban smog , upon airway , particular mucin-type secretory cell and/or interaction epithelial physiology , investigate vigorously , best superficially , vivo . We recently demonstrate genetically diverse inbred mouse O3-induced pulmonary inflammation up-regulation lung mucin secretion airway mucociliary clearance host factor dependent . These result match translationally evaluation human O3 exposure lead alteration mucociliary clearance , release mediator ( ) capable increase mucin protein synthesis secretion vitro . Importantly additional observation u healthy cohort non-smoking human subject ( n=135 ) demonstrate homozygotic genotype single nucleotide polymorphism quinone oxido-reductase enzyme , NQO1 , protect acute irritant effect air flow occur exposure ambient level O3 . We also find NQO1 modulate synthesis mucin proteins airway epithelial cell vitro ; connection host-factor dependency , NQO1 differentially express mouse model susceptible resistant O3 . As work global hypothesis propose exposure O3 susceptible human activate NQO1 , generate reactive oxygen metabolite lead increase MUC5AC mRNA expression production mucins airway epithelial cell . This cycle re-initiated O3-induced airway neutrophilia , lead re-activation NQO1 neutrophil elastase , lead expression secretion mucin , disorder mucociliary clearance , reduce pulmonary function . Investigations propose mouse model represent O3 susceptible strain , lung mucin hypersecretion model , NQO1 deficient model simultaneous translational study human segregate genetically wild-type ( NQO1 sufficient ) single nucleotide polymorphism associate NQO1 deficiency . The research plan initial step towards definitive link ubiquitous urban air pollutant , genetic factor regulate oxidant-induced airway hypersecretion mucus .</detailed_description>
