	<brief_title>Aflibercept Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer That Did Not Respond Radioactive Iodine Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine radiographic response rate ( RECIST criterion ) IV VEGF Trap four cycle ( approximately 8 week ) therapy , well 6-month progression-free-survival ( PFS ) rate ( part composite primary outcome measure ) , patient recurrent and/or metastatic differentiate thyroid carcinoma follicular cell origin ( D-TC-FCO ; comprise papillary , follicular , Hurthle cell , respective variant ) amenable RAI curative surgery . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety toxicity profile IV VEGF Trap patient recurrent and/or metastatic TC-FCO . Please see adverse event table specific protocol . II . To determine biologic effect IV VEGF Trap FDG avidity four cycle ( approximately 8 week ) therapy pre- post-treatment FDG-PET scan patient recurrent and/or metastatic D-TC-FCO . III . To determine change thyroglobulin concentration four cycle ( approximately 8 week ) IV VEGF-Trap therapy correlate radiographic response four cycle ( approximately 8 week ) progression-free-survival 6 month start therapy patient recurrent and/or metastatic D-TC-FCO . IV . To determine pre-treatment serum VEGF concentration correlate clinical outcome IV VEGF Trap therapy patient recurrent and/or metastatic D-TC-FCO . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine population pharmacokinetics IV VEGF Trap patient thyroid cancer . II . To determine whether antibody VEGF Trap develop patient thyroid cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive aflibercept intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience clear clinical benefit aflibercept may continue treatment beyond 12 month , discretion study sponsor . Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) -PET scan baseline 8 week study therapy evaluate change FDG avidity FDG-PET scan . Blood sample obtain baseline periodically study laboratory correlative study . Samples examine pretreatment serum VEGF concentration , thyroglobulin level ( elevate ) , serum pharmacokinetics aflibercept ELISA , anti-aflibercept antibody . After completion study therapy , patient follow 2-4 month .</detailed_description>
