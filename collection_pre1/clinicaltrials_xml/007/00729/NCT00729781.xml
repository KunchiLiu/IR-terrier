	<brief_summary>The purpose study research polyester polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) implant treatment external nasal valve collapse ( NVC ) . NVC condition cause narrowness weakness nostril result nasal obstruction . Implants place affected nostril ( ) . The implant intend restore shape stabilize nasal wall prevent nasal valve collapse improve symptom associate nasal obstruction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Polyester Implants Treatment External Nasal Valve Collapse ( NVC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect PET implant external NVC cosmetic contour deformity evaluate open-label , prospective study . Subjects clinical study recruit screen clinic office visit patient record principal investigator 's site well investigational review board ( IRB ) -approved general advertisement . Those patient continue qualify either screen process see evaluate one clinical investigator prior enrollment study . Subjects must meet criterion diagnosis external nasal valve collapse stand alone abnormality ( i.e. , symptom obstruction cause primarily factor ) . Other contribute factor nasal obstruction must rule and/or treat , without relief enrollment study . No surgeries procedure allow study could influence evaluation implant treatment nasal valve collapse cosmetic contour deformity . All subject require sign IRB approve informed consent prior entry study . After meet inclusion/exclusion criterion complete pre-implant evaluation , subject schedule treatment polyethylene terephthalate implant . The implant procedure perform facial plastic physician . All investigative site require undergo training standardize methodology implant technique administration evaluation technique ( questionnaire , scale , photographic assessment , etc. ) . Target sample size study 72 subject . Follow evaluations outcome measure occur 1 , 6 , 12 week implantation . Long-term follow-up adverse event conduct 11 month later implantation .</detailed_description>
