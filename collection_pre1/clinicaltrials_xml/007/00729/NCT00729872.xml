	<brief_title>A Phase 2a Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacodynamics Efficacy AG011 Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study verify safety tolerability AG011 determine whether AG011 successfully treat symptom Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) . Three different dosage use reference placebo . AG011 experimental medication . It develop potential treatment moderately active UC . AG011 clinical formulation genetically modify L. lactis engineer secrete human Interleukin-10 ( hIL-10 ) . By deliver hIL-10 locally inflamed tissue intestine , believe , compare hIL-10 give injection , effectiveness may increase , few adverse effect . Study medication provide capsule enema ( topical rectal application ) form ActoGeniX NV . Subjects enter sequentially one three dose group , start low dose group . Within first two dose group , 15 subject enter . Within high dose group , 30 subject enter . Within dose group , subject randomly assign 2:1 ratio receive either AG011 placebo 28 day . Timely monitoring safety data plan study , subject enrollment continue without interruption purpose data collection dose group . Safety tolerability closely monitor Clinical Safety Specialist ( CSS ) assign study . The CSS review adverse event laboratory safety data report safety concern Sponsor Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) . At least 8 subject must safely complete study treatment 28 day specific dose level , prior escalation next dose group . The DSMC convene ass safety data 8 subject complete study treatment 28 day specific dose level . The role DSMC study complete subject study complete study treatment . For patient randomize within active group , UC symptom could improve . As result information gather study , knowledge understand UC could improve .</detailed_description>
