	<brief_summary>Many patient sustain stroke unable effectively use hemiparetic upper extremity . Limited mobility performance daily activity , eat dressing , adversely affect quality life compromise independence . Rehabilitation techniques engage hemiparetic limb repetitive task practice ( RTP ) may improve upper extremity function quality life patient stroke , cost limit number patient utilize type therapy . Advances microprocessor design function make use assistive device adjunct RTP plausible . An innovative assistive repetitive motion ( ARM ) device use `` air muscle '' develop specifically rehabilitation hemiparetic upper extremity . The primary aim propose study collect pilot data estimate clinical effectiveness use ARM device conjunction RTP improve upper extremity motor function quality life patient stroke . Twenty sub-acute ( 3 9 mo . post-stoke ) patient randomize RTP ARM + RTP group . The RTP group receive 15 day ( 4 hour per day ) intensive one-on-one RTP therapy . The ARM + RTP group use ARM device 2 hour per day receive 2 hour intensive RTP per day 15 day . Clinical motor function quality life measure take intervention two month later . We hypothesize ARM + RTP group exhibit great improvement motor function quality life measure RTP group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Estimate effectiveness use assistive repetitive motion device ( ARM ) conjunction repetitive task practice ( RTP ) motor recovery patient sub-acute stroke . This aim examine compare pre-intervention motor performance level immediate post-intervention two month post-intervention . The primary outcome variable score Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment Test ( FMA ) Wolf Motor Function Test ( WMFT ) . We hypothesize patient RTP + ARM group exhibit great gain upper extremity motor recovery/performance RTP ARM group . Specific Aim 2 : Estimate effectiveness use ARM device conjunction RTP health relate quality life patient sub-acute stoke . This aim examine administration clinical quality life questionnaire . The primary outcome variable assess health relate quality life change score Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) , control depressed mood measure Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression ( CES-D ) scale , pre- , immediate post two-month post intervention test session . We hypothesize patient RTP + ARM group exhibit great improvement quality life measure two-month follow-up session RTP ARM group . Study Design , Methods Procedures : Patients randomize one follow three interventional group : repetitive task practice , assistive repetitive motion repetitive task practice plus assistive repetitive motion . Details regard activity group perform . 1 . Repetitive task practice ( RTP ) procedure : patient RTP group work closely rehabilitation professional ( supervisor ) four hour per day three week . We currently accept application position . At minimum , individual license Physical Occupational Therapist clinical experience desire participate follow outline research protocol . Patients report Mellon Center Cleveland Clinic Foundation ( CCF ) around 8:00 AM day leave around 12:00 PM . During stay CCF ask engage series activity plan use weaker impair hand arm . We make additional measure speed functional activity ( reach fold towel ) test day immediately train period two month completion training ( e.g . Wolf Motor Function Test ( WMFT ) Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment ( FMA ) ) . Quality life assess Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) control depression use Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression ( CES-D ) scale . These clinical test require approximately 1.5 hour administer . Participants also encourage use weaker hand arm home weekend . 2 . Assistive repetitive motion ( ARM ) procedure : Patients report Mellon Center Cleveland Clinic Foundation ( CCF ) around 8:00 AM day leave around 12:00 PM . During stay CCF ask wear assistive device impair affected upper extremity . This device place snugly arm wrist . The device small `` air muscle '' activate slowly lift finger wrist rest wrist position . This device classify non-significant risk device FDA ( see attach letter date 1-15-05 ) . The patient experience pain discomfort stretch activity . If experience pain discomfort activate stop switch locate control box unimpaired hand . The SIS , CES-D WMFT FMA administer immediately train period two month completion training . 3 . RTP + ARM Procedure : Patients report Mellon Center Cleveland Clinic Foundation ( CCF ) around 8:00 AM day leave around 12:00 PM . During stay CCF ask wear assistive device impair affected upper extremity two hour . This device place snugly arm wrist . The device small `` air muscle '' activate slowly lift finger wrist rest wrist position . They experience pain discomfort stretch activity . If experience pain discomfort activate stop switch locate control box unimpaired hand . After completion two hour ARM intervention participate two hour RTP therapy . During time engage series activity plan use weaker impair hand arm . The SIS , CES-D WMFT FMA administer immediately train period two month completion training . The result project provide valuable data pre-requisite submission multi-year R01 randomize clinical trial determine clinical efficacy use assistive device , ARM , adjunct RTP . This project potential increase availability effective rehabilitation technique patient stroke . Inclusion criteria Patients exclude somatosensory deficit nature previous physical intervention . We randomize patient basis side stroke hand dominance undertake secondary data analysis examine variable . In past application one form RTP , CI therapy , chronic stroke patient laboratories Taub Miltner , significant difference treatment effect patient right left-sided stroke . In previous evaluation CI therapy , Taub find difference outcome among small percentage patient pre-morbid left dominance . Therefore , reason exclude patient participation . We believe motivation improve use affected pre-stroke non-dominant upper extremity sufficiently strong support profound improvement treat limb well treat dominant limb . Distributions dominance hand preference acquire patient meet eligibility criterion 1998 several site determine participation site EXCITE trial side cerebral pathology show remarkably equal left-right distribution .
