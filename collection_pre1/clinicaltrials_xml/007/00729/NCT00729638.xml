	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine high dose lenalidomide RAD001 give without cause many serious side effect . Another goal research study look participant cancer may respond study treatment . Additionally , wish learn body breaks get rid study drug . We also try find substance blood ( biomarkers ) may help predict myeloma respond study treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RAD001 Lenalidomide Treatment Subjects With Relapsed Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Researchers look high dos RAD001 lenalidomide use combination give safely small group people enrol step trial . The first group give certain dose RAD001 certain dose lenalidomide . If manageable side effect , next small group people enrol high dose RAD001 and/or high dose lenalidomide . This continue high dose drug use determine . - Study treatment give 28 day cycle . Both RAD001 lenalidomide pill take orally . Both drug start day . RAD001 take either every day every day first 3 week ( day 1-21 ) 28-day cycle . Lenalidomide take daily first 3 week ( day 1-21 ) cycle . - Participants come clinic weekly first cycle monitor side effect . The follow perform clinic visit : physical examination , medical history update , questionnaire , blood work . - On cycle 2-8 , participant come clinic Day 1 cycle . The follow perform clinic visit : physical examination , medical history update , questionnaire , blood word . - At end cycle 8 , skeletal survey , bone marrow aspiration biopsy perform check response study treatment . - Participants may continue receive RAD001 lenalidomide beyond 8 cycle cancer get worse unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
