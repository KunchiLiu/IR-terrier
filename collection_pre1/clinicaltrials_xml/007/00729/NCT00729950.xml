	<brief_title>Study MDX-010 Subjects With Unresectable Stage III Stage IV Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group A : Six 12 subject treat transfectoma-derived MDX-010 2.8 5 mg/kg/dose , hybridoma-derived MDX-010 3 mg/kg/dose administer Days 1 , 57 , 85 . The 2.8 , 3 , 5 mg/kg dosage cohort may initiate concurrently . Additionally , 6 subject per cohort receive single dos transfectoma-derived MDX-010 7.5 , 10 , 15 , 20 mg/kg . Dose escalation 5 mg/kg cohort 7.5 mg/kg cohort depend safety profile follow single dose 5 mg/kg . Once subject enrol 5 mg/kg cohort 4 week elapse since sixth subject cohort receive first infusion , dose escalation 7.5 mg/kg cohort may occur ≤1 DLT occur 5 mg/kg cohort . Dose escalation 10 mg/kg cohort may occur 4 week sixth subject 7.5 mg/kg/dose cohort receive first infusion ( ≤1 DLT ) . Dose escalation 15 20 mg/kg cohort may occur 4 week sixth subject previous cohort receive first infusion ( ≤1 DLT ) . Up six additional subject may enrol MTD dose cohort 20 mg/kg dose cohort MTD attain . Group B : If single-dose administration MDX-010 10 mg/kg well tolerate ( ≤1 DLT cohort Group A ) , additional 12 20 subject enrol treat MDX-010 10 mg/kg/dose administer Days 1 , 22 , 43 , 64 . Subjects respond therapy follow disease progression maximum approximately 1 year . Subjects response SD ≥ 3 month , PR , CR initial treatment cycle subsequently relapse may eligible retreatment regimen alternate regimen consider effective time retreatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must read , understood , provide write informed consent authorization compliance Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) afer nature study fully explain . Subject must least 18 year age histologic diagnosis unresectable Stage III IV malignant melanoma ( may include mucosal melanoma ) . Subjects either stable progressive malignancy permit study . Classification stable progressive disease , record subject , define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , detailed Appendix 3 determine since last melanoma treatment . Subjects must least 1 site measurable disease . At least 4 week since treatment ( surgery , chemotherapy , radiation , immuno therapy ) melanoma recover serious toxicity experience treatment . Life expectancy least 18 week . Karnofsky Performance Status least 70 % Screening laboratory value must meet following criterion : WBC ≥2500/μL ANC ≥1500/μL Platelets ≥100 x 10'/μL Hematocrit ≥30 % Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL Creatinine ≤2 mg/dL AST ≤2 x ULN* Bilirubin ≤1.0 x ULN* , ( except subject Gilbert 's Syndrome , must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL ) HIV negative HBsAg negative antiHCV nonreactive . If reactive , subject must negative HCV RNA qualitative PCR . Unless definitely attributable disease . Any prior malignancy except follow : adequately treat basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , carcinoma situ cervix , cancer subject diseasefree least 5 year History autoimmune disease ( include uveitis autoimmune inflammatory eye disease ) prior entrance study . Active infection require therapy , chronic active HBV HCV , confirm reactivity HIV test . Tetanus booster immunization within 2 month initial screening procedure , history anaphylaxis severe local reaction tetanus vaccine . Pregnant nursing : know effect MDX010 could develop immune system fetus infant , therefore , exposure utero via breast milk allow . Any underlying medical condition , opinion principal investigator , make administration study drug hazardous obscure interpretation adverse event . Any concurrent medical condition require use systemic topical corticosteroid use immunosuppressive agent ( e.g . cyclosporine analog , chemotherapy agent ) . All corticosteroid use must discontinue least 4 week prior trial entry . Prior treatment MDX010 antiCTLA4 monoclonal antibody . Evidence history significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic , renal , psychiatric gastrointestinal disease would make administration MDX010 unsafe . Concurrent treatment chemotherapy immunotherapy regimen ( must complete least 4 week Screening ) .</criteria>
