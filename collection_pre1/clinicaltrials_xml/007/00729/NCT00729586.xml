	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well temsirolimus without megestrol acetate tamoxifen citrate work treat patient endometrial cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment , return period improvement , persistent . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Estrogen cause growth endometrial cancer cell . Hormone therapy use megestrol acetate tamoxifen citrate may fight endometrial cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . It yet know whether temsirolimus effective give alone together megestrol acetate tamoxifen citrate treat endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temsirolimus With Without Megestrol Acetate Tamoxifen Citrate Treating Patients With Advanced , Persistent , Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate patient advance , persistent , recurrent endometrial cancer treat arm trial ; propose arm : Arm # 1 temsirolimus intravenously ( IV ) weekly , Arm # 2 megestrol ( megestrol acetate ) /tamoxifen ( tamoxifen citrate ) plus temsirolimus IV weekly . II . Time progression number patient remain study therapy 24 week . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . To describe toxicity arm trial use patient advanced/metastatic endometrial cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Explore whether immunohistochemical expression hormone receptor ( estrogen receptor-alpha , estrogen receptor-beta , progesterone receptors-A , progesterone receptor-B alternative estrogen receptor , G protein-coupled estrogen receptor [ GPR ] -30 ) component mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) signal pathway ( normal mutant phosphatase tensin homolog [ PTEN ] , total phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 [ Akt ] well total phosphorylated p70S6 kinase ) associate treatment , outcome clinical characteristic . II . Explore whether single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) FK506-binding protein 12-rapamycin-associated protein 1 ( FRAP1 ) regulatory associate protein mTOR ( RAPTOR ) gene , mutation phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) , PTEN paxillin copy number abnormality PTEN paxillin associate treatment , outcome clinical characteristic . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ( Closed accrual 11/22/2010 ) ARM I : Patients receive temsirolimus IV 30 minute weekly 6 week . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( Closed accrual 12/21/2009 ) : Patients receive temsirolimus Arm I megestrol acetate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 3 week alternate tamoxifen citrate PO BID 3 week . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
