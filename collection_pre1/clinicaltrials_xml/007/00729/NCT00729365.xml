	<brief_title>PREVENTKD ( Prevent Risks Early interVEntion Nighttime Type 1 Diabetes Kidney Disease )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only fraction person Type 1 diabetes ( less 40 % ) develop diabetic kidney disease ( nephropathy ) . When urinary albumin ( protein normally excrete small amount ) within normal range , prevalence high blood pressure ( hypertension ) base office blood pressure reading low . Many person , however , develop nocturnal hypertension ( high nighttime blood pressure ) development abnormally high urinary albumin excretion ( condition refer microalbuminuria ) . Currently , early treatment medication call ACE inhibitor recommend indication kidney damage , reflect presence microalbuminuria . Beginning ACE inhibitor therapy currently recommend prior development microalbuminuria , unless patient high blood pressure , would result over-treatment many people . By time microalbuminuria develops , however , kidney damage may present many patient develop kidney disease . It would therefore beneficial identify subject develop microalbuminuria , treatment could start early individual . Persons may go develop protein urine eventual kidney disease perhaps could identify basis abnormal fall ( little ) blood pressure night . This pattern confuse high blood pressure , instead see early indication present development high blood pressure microalbuminuria . The purpose current study therefore aim demonstrate possible prevent kidney disease patient type 1 diabetes normal office blood pressure urine protein excretion select basis abnormal fall blood pressure night . Moreover , clinical trial reveal impact long-term administration ACE inhibitor nighttime blood pressure also assess change relative stiffness blood vessel ( endothelial dysfunction ) person type 1 diabetes time .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects type 1 diabetes confirm C peptide measurement . Male Female subject race include study . Subjects age must 13 50 year Duration disease ( time diagnosis diabetes ) must 5 28 year . Subjects must normotensive define systolic blood pressure ≤ 130 mmHg diastolic ≤ 85 mmHg subject 18 old child ( age 1317 ) blood pressure normal range base standard table take account gender , height age . The mean 24 blood pressure must meet criteria office blood pressure outline . Subject must normoalbuminuria ( UAE &lt; 30 mg/24 hr ) If subject female must breastfeed , childbearing potential , defined postmenopausal least 1 year surgically sterile ; child bear potential , must practice one follow method birth control : 1 ) condom , sponge , foam , jelly , diaphragm intrauterine device ( IUD ) , 2 ) contraceptive ( oral parenteral ) initiate three month prior study drug administration , 3 ) maintain monogamous relationship vasectomize partner , 4 ) total abstinence sexual intercourse . Type 2 diabetic type diabetic maturity onset diabetes young ( MODY ) exclude basis establish clinical criterion . Subjects history hypertension take hypertensive medication . Females pregnant express desire become pregnant study . Females breastfeed . Refer detail inclusion criterion regard female . Subjects history take ACE inhibitor within last six month current indication ACE inhibitor therapy . Subjects ( 18 year age ) current blood pressure 130mmHg/85mmHg . Subjects ( 1317 year age ) meet normal range base standard table Subjects currently microalbuminuric i.e . 24hr albumin &gt; 30mg Subjects participate interventional clinical trial involve ABPM 6 month prior study . Subjects diagnosis chronic atrial fibrillation . Subjects lifestyle would disrupt normal circadian rhythm ( i.e . nightshift worker ) . Subjects current serious comorbid condition life expectancy &lt; 2 year . Subjects history noncompliance , psychiatric disturbance would preclude successful completion study . Inability give inform consent .</criteria>
