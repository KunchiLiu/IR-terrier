	<brief_summary>The Jump-In study prospectively assess effect impact exercise skeletal development young girl , include bone mass , bone mineral density , bone geometry . We hypothesize girl regularly participate impact load exercise accrue great skeletal mass , increase bone density undergo structural adaptation combination improve bone strength compare girl participate impact exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Jump-In school-based , block-randomized , trial effect impact-loading exercise skeletal development prepubescent early pubescent girl . Fourth ( n=~200 ) sixth ( n=~200 ) grade girl 14 Tucson ( Arizona ) school contraindication physical exercise enrol . Girls intervention school participate impact activity 3 time per week school , progressively increase number ( 40 ) jump height ( 6 inch 18 inch per repetition ) initial 2 month . Thereafter , new activity introduce approximately every 2-3 month maintain interest motivation , continually stress skeleton novel way , 2 year intervention . Physical behavioral assessment do intervention control group baseline , end initial school year , yearly thereafter 5 year . Assessments include height weight , select skeletal length , fat , lean soft tissue , bone mineral content areal density dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , bone geometry ( e.g. , cortical thickness , periosteal circumference cortical trabecular density ) muscle area peripheral quantitative compute tomography ( pQCT ) . Also , maturation assess via Tanner Stage ( self-assessment standardize drawing stage physical development ) , diet Harvard Youth Food Frequency Questionnaire , physical activity use pedometer standardized questionnaire . We hypothesize girl intervention school demonstrate enhance skeletal development , include great mineral mass density , enhance bone geometry , lead great bone strength compare girl control school . We hypothesize young ( Tanner State 1 ) girl experience great adaptation old girl ( Tanner 2 3 ) , positive adaptation maintain throughout 3-year follow-up period .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>female ; enter 4th 6th grade enrollment ; willing able undergo test requirement ; physical activity limitation ; able read write English . Girls severe learn disability ( identified school ) , unable complete questionnaire otherwise comply assessment protocol exclude . Any subject ( potential subject ) suffer medical condition and/or disability would limit participation exercise exclude study , follow American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) guideline . Further , volunteer take medication would limit exercise and/or alter bone mineral accrual also exclude study . Girls positive pregnancy screen test time lab visit DXA scanning exclude .</criteria>
