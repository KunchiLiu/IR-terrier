	<detailed_description>Background Significance : Despite advancement pain management , pain relief patient satisfaction still inadequate many patient . Functional image technique recently make possible identify main cerebral component human nociceptive system . These comprise least two main human nociceptive component work parallel call medial lateral pain system . This provide physical construct concept human pain matrix . Careful study area human brain potential drive development new class analgesic compound . PET image technique quantify increase nerve cell activity selective region brain ( 1-5 ) . PET provide mean measure tissue concentration label drug brain tissue also measure change receptor occupancy . Earlier study examine pattern increase brain activity follow experimentally-induced acute pain ( 2 ) chronic pain syndrome ( 1,3,5 ) . Distal pain pathway ( e.g . spinothalamic tract ) project thalamus discrete region cortex via thalamocortical projection . Among cortical area involve sensation , perception , attention human monkey anterior cingulate gyrus , insular cortex , primary somatosensory cortex , secondary somatosensory cortex . PET study experimental human pain also demonstrate activation brain area related sensory-motor integration . However , depend type noxious stimulation , different area brain activate ( 2 ) . Components lateral system primary somatosensory ( SI ) cortex appear frequently activate tonic ( non-phasic experimental pain ) phasic pain ( 67 % 69 % study show activation , respectively ) . But 23 % study chronic clinical pain study demonstrate activation SI . We perform first clinical study ( IRB study # 05121504 ) investigate change brain activity associate significant postoperative pain ( 6 ) . This IRB-approved study one patient establish method developed sensitive enough complete randomize clinical trial . We determine postsurgical pain associate increased activity contralateral primary somatosensory cortex . Other brain region show increased postsurgical activity contralateral parietal cortex , bilateral pulvinar ipsilateral medial dorsal nucleus thalamus , contralateral putamen , contralateral superior temporal gyrus , ipsilateral fusiform gyrus , ipsilateral posterior lobe contralateral anterior cerebellar lobe . We receive permission IRB perform large study 21 patient ( IRB study # 07050273 ) . Although fMRI also use functional brain imaging , advantage PET fMRI ( 7 ) : PET detect neural tissue , fMRI detect venous compartment 1 . PET 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ( FDG ) give direct measure glucose metabolism , fMRI measure blood flow measuring change deoxyhemoglobin concentration 2 . PET large signal-to-noise ratio fMRI 3 . PET less susceptible movement artifact fMRI 4 . With PET brain head scanner , less claustrophobic fMRI 5 . PET inhomogeneity artifacts fMRI 6 . PET capacity future ligand-binding study ( e.g . opioid receptor ) Comparable brain imaging study perform primate due difficulty animal move duration scan , without use anesthetic . To good interpret PET brain image clinical trial , need baseline data variability brain activation person-to person , especially people minimal pain . Clinical oncology utilizes PET image diagnosis monitor many type cancer , e.g . Hodgkin 's disease , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , lung cancer . The brain individual consider within normal range could control study involve postoperative pain alleviation . To obtain 'control ' brain scan , patient scan disease outside brain would additional radionuclide injection . Instead , primary body scan complete , patient platform would move slightly head center scanner , scan process resume , approximately 20 minute . Since half-life FDG radionuclide 110 min , still adequate signal available pick detector secondary scan .</detailed_description>
