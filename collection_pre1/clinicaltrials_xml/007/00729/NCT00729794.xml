	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Inhospital cardiac arrest still constitute important clinical problem survival discharge range within 0-42 % ( common range = 15-20 % ) ( 1 ) . Survival witness , pulseless ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia ( VF/VT ) responsive one two direct current countershock ( ) may exceed 30 % . However , survival inhospital asystole , pulseless electrical activity , refractory VF/VT ( define responsive two countershocks ) may substantially lower ( i.e. , 5-10 % ) ( 2 ) . As nonsurvivors , endogenous vasopressin adrenocorticotrophin reduce compare survivor ( 3,4 ) , investigator hypothesize addition exogenous vasopressin cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) ( 5 ) steroid CPR may increase rate return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) improve post-arrest survival . This hypothesis support single-center result NCT 00411879 . Thus , investigator intend either refute provide definitive evidence support hypothesis ( generalizability ) conduct present multicenter , randomize , control clinical trial inhospital cardiac arrest . Methods Adult in-patients cardiac arrest responsive two direct current countershocks ( applicable ) , asystole , pulseless electrical activity randomize receive either arginine vasopressin ( 20 IU/CPR cycle first 5 CPR-cycles non-VF/VT second sixth CPR-cycle VF/VT ) plus epinephrine ( 1 mg/CPR-cycle ) plus methylprednisolone ( single dose = 40 mg first second CPR-cycle non-VF/VT VF/VT , respectively ) normal saline-placebo plus epinephrine ( 1 mg/CPR-cycle ) plus normal saline-placebo first 5 second sixth CPR-cycles . Further CPR-vasopressor treatment include epinephrine ( 1 mg/CPR-cycle ) group . Apart initial , combine drug administration study group , CPR conduct full concordance 2005 Guidelines Advanced Life Support ( 5 ) . Following ROSC presence postresuscitation shock ( define inability maintain mean arterial pressure &gt; 70 mm Hg without use exogenous catecholamine infusion rate confer vasopressor and/or inotropic activity ) , study group patient receive stress-dose hydrocortisone ( 300 mg/day maximum 7 day gradual taper ) , whereas control receive saline placebo . Patients pre-arrest history clinical feature , and/or electrocardiographic , biochemical , echocardiographic evidence acute myocardial infarction receive stress-dose hydrocortisone ( study-group ) saline-placebo ( control-group ) maximum 3 day , follow gradual taper.1 This time-limit chosen prevent potential retardation infarct heal glucocorticoid treatment ( 6 ) . Following ROSC , control group patient may receive stress dose steroid treatment prescribe attend physician indication septic shock know adrenocortical insufficiency . This hold also study group patient follow-up period . Any steroid prescription attend physician cancel concomitant investigational intervention regard steroid supplementation result patient exclusion , unless prescribe corticosteroid regimen full concordance above-described , protocolized one . The investigator involve CPR drug administration blind use ( no-use ) vasopressin methylprednisolone , coordinate CPR procedure . For study group , steroid treatment determine hospital pharmacy , also aware computer-based patient randomization encoding , prepare study drug CPR . Patient follow-up data record conduct associate unaware CPR drug regimen . Daily follow-up day 60 post-arrest include physiological variable , medication treatment intervention , result laboratory diagnostic study ( include serum interleukin day 1-10 ) , determination sequential organ dysfunction assessment ( SOFA ) score . For first 10 day post-randomization , monitored/recorded physiological variable include hemodynamics ( arterial central venous pressure , heart rate ) , gas exchange respiratory mechanic , body temperature , urinary output fluid balance . Patient neurological status assess Glasgow Coma Score . Additional follow-up data include hospital/intensive care unit ( ICU ) -related morbidity , length ICU/hospital stay , cerebral performance/residual disability ( 7 ) hospital discharge . As previous cardiac arrest trial , requirement informed consent drug combination CPR waive . However , informed consent actually request corticosteroid treatment postresuscitation shock . Furthermore , patient ' family always inform trial resuscitation procedure . Any next-of-kin objection regard trial result patient exclusion . Randomization Technique Randomization conduct block four use Research Randomizer ( www.randomizer.org ) . Pre-specified subgroup analysis include effect study center , data patient subgroup define accord need &gt; 5mg = &lt; 5 mg epinephrine CPR . Post hoc analysis include within-group control group comparison accord actual use use stress dose hydrocortisone ( 300 mg /day maximum 7 day follow gradual taper ) attend physician . Also , patient without `` crossover '' control group compare patient VSE group . Lastly , follow relative suggestion Data Monitoring Committee , attempt determine 1 year survival good neurological recovery ; purpose , survivor group ( and/or family ) contact / interview telephone communication ; follow in-person interview/examination survivor . After completion three year last patient data collection primary outcome , study data maintain de-identified electronic form .
