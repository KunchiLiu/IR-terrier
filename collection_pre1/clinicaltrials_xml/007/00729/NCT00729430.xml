	<brief_title>Evaluating Heart Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Procedure Effect Fish Oil Supplementation People Who Have Recently Had Heart Attack ( The PROSPECT-CMR Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new MRI technique examine heart recently develop . In study , researcher use new technique evaluate heart people recently heart attack determine whether specific pattern heart muscle damage relate sudden cardiac death . This fatal condition , also know cardiac arrest , occur heart abruptly stop pump blood body , result loss consciousness , absence pulse , stop breathing . The common cause sudden cardiac death heart attack . In addition evaluate new heart MRI technique , study also examine effect fish oil supplementation people recently heart attack . Recent research show omega-3 fatty acid , commonly find fish oil , may beneficial people heart condition . Lastly , study determine whether specific biomarkers genetic factor help predict likelihood person die sudden cardiac death previously experience heart attack . Apart study likelihood sudden cardiac death , This study measure change structure pump function heart ( know ventricular remodel ) study determine high dose fish oil treatment result improvement heart . This study enroll people heart attack 2 4 week study entry . At baseline study visit , participant undergo MRI heart complete exercise stress test treadmill . A blood sample collect , woman provide urine sample pregnancy test . Questionnaires ask diet , medical history , emotion also complete . Participants randomly assign receive either fish oil supplement placebo daily basis 6 month . Every 2 3 month , study researcher call participant check health progress . At study visit Month 6 , participant undergo repeat baseline test . After visit , study researcher call participant every 6 month 3 year follow participant ' health status .</detailed_description>
