	<brief_summary>The research plan propose develop translational study human identify host susceptibility factor confer vulnerability prototypal air pollutant , ozone . Ozone ubiquitous urban air pollutant associate increased emergency room visit , co-associates air pollutant , increase mortality high risk group ( cardio-pulmonary disease ) population.The result significant impact upon aid understanding mechanisms pro-oxidant lung injury , airway hyperresponsiveness , adverse health effect , occur follow exposure inhalable airborne irritant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exposure airways air toxin initiate transient reversible airway injury adult young child . Repetitive exposure child reside within high oxidant community lead impairment lung growth pulmonary function , remodel airway epithelial tissue also suggest occur . In completely normal/healthy airway , exposure ozone ( O3 ) , ubiquitous urban air pollutant , induce inflammatory response characterize increase epithelial permeability , neutrophilic infiltration , bronchial hyperreactivity . Inhalation humans pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( Tnf ) lead development nearly identical response : hyperresponsiveness bronchial airway ( AHR ) , neutrophil influx . Using controlled exposure O3 laboratory setting , recently establish link genetic single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) TNF gene ( -308 ) development AHR methacholine within 24 h time frame , post exposure O3 . In healthy human study group ( n=137 ) presence common TNF ( -308 ) SNP find confer susceptibility ambient concentration O3 ( 220 ppb , frequently attain many city US summer month ) : stratify ethnicity , Caucasian subject homozygotic ( A/A ) heterozygotic ( G/A ) minor allele TNF ( -308 ) SNP 2-times likely develop sensitivity methacholine O3 compare subject wild-type , major allele ( G/G ) haplotype . Literature report suggest TNF ( -308 ) polymorphism associate increase TNF gene transcription increase Tnf cytokine production . However , functional significance common TNF polymorphism remain uncertain ; moreover , functional implication TNF ( -308 ) polymorphism lung remain undeveloped . We hypothesize subject either homozygotic ( A/A ) heterozygotic ( G/A ) minor allele TNF ( -308 ) promoter polymorphism , demonstrate enhancement phenotypic response O3 include : increase cellular inflammation secretion pre-inflammation cytokine , enhance activation resident alveolar macrophage , alter bronchial sensitivity , lead AHR . Our research plan design mechanistically investigate interaction host factor humans exposure prototypal air pollutant , ozone . The research plan expand upon , enable , clear assignment functional contribution common SNP TNF gene initiation airway hyperresponsiveness , cardinal feature inflammatory airway disease .</detailed_description>
