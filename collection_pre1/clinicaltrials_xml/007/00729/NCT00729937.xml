	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine optimal outpatient treatment strategy uncomplicated skin soft tissue infection ( SSTI ) area United States prevalence Community-Acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus ( S. ) aureus ( CA-MRSA ) high . Infection S. aureus bacteria resistant antibiotic cause SSTIs . Three oral antibiotic test patent treatment . Patients receive Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( TMP/SMX ) , placebo ( substance contain medication ) , clindamycin , cephalexin combination . The study population include 2,235 volunteer , child 13 year age adult present 5 large urban Emergency Departments . Therapy acute uncomplicated SSTIs , include abscess , infect wound , cellulitis start day enrollment . Participants may involve study related procedure 9 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( CA-MRSA ) recently emerge cause skin soft-tissue infection ( SSTI ) . In current era increase CA-MRSA infection , outpatient management SSTIs well study . This clinical trial evaluate oral off-patent antibiotic outpatient treatment patient 3 main type acute uncomplicated SSTI , i.e. , abscess , infected wound , cellulitis . Upon enrollment , subject stratify type infection , randomize various treatment . Subjects acute uncomplicated cutaneous abscess receive incision drainage ( I &amp; D ) treat Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( TMP/SMX ) placebo determine whether addition antibiotic activity CA-MRSA clinically efficacious I &amp; D alone . Subjects acute wound infection treat TMP/SMX clindamycin determine clindamycin , antibiotic activity CA-MRSA , methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ( MSSA ) , streptococci clinically efficacious TMP/SMX , antibiotic activity CA-MRSA MSSA . Subjects acute cellulitis treat cephalexin/TMP/SMX cephalexin/placebo determine cephalexin/TMP/SMX clinically efficacious cephalexin alone . The primary objective type SSTI study compare cure rate per protocol ( PP ) population . Secondary objective provide additional mean assessment clinical efficacy employ intervention resolution infection include describe microbiological cure , change dimension erythema , composite cure , surgical procedure , invasive recurrent infection , infection household contact , time normal activity analgesic longer use various time PP/ modify intent-to-treat ( mITT ) population . This multi-center , randomize , double-blind clinical trial subject stratify type infection randomize various 7-day oral antibiotic treatment , include placebo-controlled comparative design . The study population include child 13 year age adult , weigh great equal 40 kg present 5 large urban emergency department . Therapy start day enrollment . Subjects evaluate upon enrollment , 2-3 day enrollment ( OTV ) , 1-3 day end-of-therapy ( EOT ) , 7-14 day end-of-therapy ( TOC ) , 6-8 week end-of-therapy ( EFV ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult child 13 year age older ( weigh great equal 40 kg ) ; Have skin soft tissue infection ( SSTI ) three local finding erythema ( &gt; 2 cm across lesion discrete wound edge ) , tenderness , swelling/induration . Fever , leukocytosis , lymphangitis note , enrollment criterion . SSTI local finding categorize define one : 1 . Abscess fluctuant and/or indurate lesion , finding fluidfilled cavity soft tissue ultrasound evaluation , open reveals purulent material , receive incision drainage ( I &amp; D ) ( consider standard care abscess ) minimum diameter ( along axis ) least 2 cm ( measured border induration , fluctuant lesion , border abscess cavity ultrasound , fluctuant ) . Note : Although I &amp; D abscess consider standard care ( i.e. , patient receive I &amp; D whether enrol study ) , procedure may perform enrollment study prior measurement area erythema swelling/induration obtain unless occult abscess I &amp; D perform prior enrollment verify infection type ensure correct classification subject . 2 . Infected Wound wound ( define apparent break skin ) apparent drainage limit depth involve skin subcutaneous tissue , include suture cutaneous wound involve intraabdominal surgery contaminate bacterial bowel content ( e.g. , colon surgery empyema drainage ) , 3 . Cellulitis area erythema without presence wound drainage abscess ; Cellulitis associate abscess categorize abscess . Cellulitis associate infect wound classify infect wound . Patients cellulitis abscess less 2 cm exclude . Infected wound associated abscess may require I &amp; D , classify infect wound . Have infect lesion 7 day less duration ; Are receive outpatient treatment enrollment/baseline ; Express willingness ability contact return reevaluation accord study protocol ; Provide write informed consent ( subject age 1317 , consent guardian assent ) ; Negative pregnancy test subject woman childbearing potential . Severe allergy reaction study drug drug similar study drug relevant whichever study subtrial subject would assign ( e.g. , patient severe lifethreatening penicillin allergy , allergy cephalosporin , clindamycin , sulfonamide , drug contain sulfur thiazide , furosemide , oral sulfonylurea ) ; Concomitant treatment ( i.e. , study drug therapy ) coumadin , phenytoin , methotrexate , suspect G6PD folic acid deficiency ; Expected inability swallow absorb study drug ( assessed patient history ) ; Pregnancy , nursing , expectation become pregnant study drug ; Perirectal ( within 5 cm anus ) , perineal nonskin lesion ( i.e. , mucosal ) , paronychial location infection . Scrotal labial abscess exclude . An infection due mammalian bite ; Treatment study drug relevant infection type , another systemic antibiotic previous 48 hour ( i.e. , screening/baseline ) unless associate treatment failure define patient prior ( non study drug ) antibiotic least 72 hour fail . Expected concurrent treatment topical antibiotic another systemic antibiotic TestofCure Visit ( TOC ) ( note : patient use topical antibiotic previously , still enrol agree stop use ) ; Immunodeficiency [ e.g. , absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500/mm^3 , chronic immunosuppressive drug , active chemotherapy , know acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) ( CD4 count &lt; 200 AIDSdefining illness within last year ) assess patient history ] . Note : patient prior AIDSdefining illness CD4 count &lt; 200 past may enrol recent CD4 count &gt; 200 ; Burn active chronic skin condition ( e.g. , include rash eczema ) relate skin softtissue infection ( SSTI ) screening/baseline ; Infection relate currently indwell device ( e.g. , intravenous line ) , except suture associate qualify infected wound remove upon enrollment ; Infection prior culture reveal vitro resistance pathogen study drug previous month prior screening/baseline ; Known suspect osteomyelitis septic arthritis ; Infection relate diabetic foot , decubitus , ischemic ulcer ; Known severe renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min ) calculate measurement serum creatinine patient provide history base past study baseline/enrollment ; Prior enrollment study within 12 week ; Another active infection another organ system ( e.g. , pneumonia ) one active ( i.e. , currently antibiotic treatment and/or require I &amp; D ) SSTI site ( e.g. , site noncontiguous infection study ) . Note : Minor folliculitis secondary site exclusion ; Presence abscess completely drain , either spontaneously healthcare provider prior enrollment ; An infect wound cellulitis surgically explore ( &gt; 1 cm incision ) reveal abscess . Cellulitis needle , minimally incise ( less equal 1 cm ) punch biopsied purulent drainage find still enrol ; Currently incarcerate detention facility police custody ( note : patient wear monitoring device enrol ) baseline/screening ; For patient infect wound , history C. difficile infection , pseudomembranous colitis , active diarrhea baseline/screening ; For patient infect wound , severe liver disease base patient history ; An intravenous ( IV ) drug user last month current presence fever ; Current residence nursing home long term care facility baseline/screening ; Expected use investigational drug vaccine study drug ; For patient abscess , cardiac condition associate high risk adverse outcome endocarditis prophylaxis reasonable , include patient prosthetic cardiac valve prosthetic material use cardiac valve repair , history previous infective endocarditis , congenital heart disease ( exclude mitral valve prolapse ) , history cardiac transplantation recipient develop cardiac valvulopathy ; Presence organic foreign body , e.g. , wood ( note : subject embed nonorganic material , e.g. , metal glass , completely remove still enrol physician certain foreign body leave ) .</criteria>
