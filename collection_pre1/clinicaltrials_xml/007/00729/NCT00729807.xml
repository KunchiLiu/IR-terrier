	<brief_title>0794GCC : Pentamidine Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine response rate patient relapse refractory melanoma express wild-type p53 S100 calcium bind protein B ( S100B ) treat pentamidine . Secondary - To observe effect drug expression S100B p21 tumor biopsy sample . - To observe effect drug S100B detectable serum . - To observe time progression patient . - To assess toxicity associate administration drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive pentamidine IV 2 hour 5 day week 2 week . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tumor tissue blood sample collection periodically correlative laboratory study . Samples assess p53 status S100B , p53 , p21 expression immunohistochemistry , polymerase chain reaction , western blotting , luminescence assay , ELISA . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
