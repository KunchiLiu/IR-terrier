	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether nebulized hypertonic saline solution reduce admission rate 48 hour initial treatment emergency department , compare normal saline solution ( placebo ) . We hypothesise patient bronchiolitis receive nebulized hypertonic saline solution less respiratory distress , less duration symptom therefore less risk hospitalize receive normal saline solution .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HYPERTONIC SALINE IN ACUTE VIRAL BRONCHIOLITIS : A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute viral bronchiolitis principal low respiratory tract infection infant worldwide , 10 % canadian infant affect year . It characterize first episode difficulty breathe , precede symptom fever , rhinorrhea cough . The accepted treatment bronchiolitis nasal cleaning , hydration oxygen administration . Multiple study document variation diagnostic testing , clinical score use different treatment modality . This suggest lack consensus diagnosis , criteria hospitalization treatment . Nebulized 3 % hypertonic saline solution propose potential treatment reduction severity respiratory symptom rate admission bronchiolitis , never study alone effect rate admission little studied . We propose randomize double blind multicenter clinical trial infant 6 week 12 month old moderate severe bronchiolitis , 9 emergency department hospital situate different province across Canada , 3 winter season . We hypothesise infant bronchiolitis treat nebulized hypertonic 3 % saline solution would less risk hospitalize would shorter less intense respiratory symptom infant treat nebulized normal saline solution . Our principal objective determine nebulized 3 % hypertonic saline solution reduce admission rate 48 hour treatment compare placebo . Secondary objective compare group intensity respiratory symptom measure different clinical score ( RDAI , PRAM , PASS IRAS ) , duration symptom , length hospital stay , add secondary effect subsequent office visit problem . Comparatively therapy already study ( dexamethasone epinephrine ) , hypertonic 3 % saline constitute interesting choice due absence potential secondary effect . Our study try optimize utilization hospital resource involve treatment bronchiolitis . Infants suffer disease could therefore profit well treatment reflect good condition , life quality consequently parent .</detailed_description>
