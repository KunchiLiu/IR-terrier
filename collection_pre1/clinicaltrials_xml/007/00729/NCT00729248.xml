	<brief_title>The Differential Effects 3 Different Immunosuppressive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Life-long immunosuppressive ( IS ) therapy typically required great majority organ transplant . Immunobiologically correct IS dose , taper low level and/or monotherapy could lower incidence complication relate IS improve long term graft patient survival . The current standard IS care liver transplant recipient calcineurin-inhibitors ( CNIs ) tacrolimus ( TAC ) cyclosporine ( CSA ) , although alternative IS drug mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) sirolimus ( SRL ) available use select patient . This also true kidney , pancreas heart transplant recipient , TAC favor case . The ideal IS agent one give low level rejection long term toxicity minimize . Directly relate IS minimization might development regulatory , `` tolerance profile '' , assess ex vivo immunophenotyping functional assay might test specific IS agent singly , combination even sequence . Human Tregs DCregs predominantly generate presence one three IS agent different mode action , i.e. , TAC , MMF SRL , different condition antigen presentation alloimmune incompatibility . This bench protocol study effect TAC , MMF SRL pre operative living renal recipient donor pair .</detailed_description>
