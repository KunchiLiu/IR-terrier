	<detailed_description>The Study Investigators Trauma subspecialty within Orthopaedic Surgery . We take care numerous patient ununited malunited fracture i.e. , nonunion/malunion patient , well patient chronic bone infection , patient infect nonunions . The literature replete article document negative effect nicotine fracture heal chronic bone infection resolution . ( 5 ) Many chronic infection nonunion/malunion patient use nicotine form . Most patient need additional elective surgery attain fracture union and/or infection resolution . Thus , face dilemma add additional procedure patient proven risk factor nonunion continued infection . Much time spend clinic counseling patient smoke cessation , requisite successful surgical outcome . Since nicotine extremely addictive , effort help trauma patient relinquish tobacco always successful . Many patient need pharmacologic help goal cessation , provide Chantix prescription . In addition provide Chantix , currently present patient , standard care , requirement smoking cessation necessary prior perform additional surgical procedure . Chantix ( generic name , varenicline ) relatively new drug design help tobacco cessation . It show great promise success since decrease craving nicotine ( highly addictive active ingredient tobacco ) diminish withdrawal symptom nicotine . This novel , dual approach work bind nicotinic receptor brain partial agonist , decrease pleasurable effect cigarettes tobacco product . Once bound receptor , Chantix block actual nicotine . While block nicotine receptor , also act like weak substitute nicotine , decrease symptom withdrawal . ( 2 ) Our study include 60 tobacco-using patient age 18 osseous nonunion , malunion , establish bone infection , combine diagnosis .</detailed_description>
