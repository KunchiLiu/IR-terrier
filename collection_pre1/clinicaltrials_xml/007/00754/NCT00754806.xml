	<detailed_description>The advent laparoscopic surgery , increase experience performance advance techniques surgical device greatly influence general surgery . The usefulness laparoscopic surgery already well proven cholecystectomy , esophageal antireflux surgery , splenectomy benign disease ( 1 ) . Laparoscopy also gain recognition procedure accompany lymph node dissection , gastric colorectal surgery ( 2 , 3 ) . The development hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery ( HALS ) also bring improvement regard various disadvantage previously associate laparoscopic surgery , include lack tactile sensation feedback , poor depth perception , lack quick access event unexpected hemorrhage , difficulty intracorporal suture . Such improvement enable performance advance laparoscopic surgery ( 4 ) . To solve problem associate long learn curve long operate time , hand port introduce . Through hand port , surgeon 's hand introduce abdomen pneumoperitoneum preserve . The use hand port reduces operate time shortens learn curve ( 5 ) . It already suggest procedure require incision remove specimen organ suitable HALS ( 6 ) . Laparoscopic splenectomy ( LS ) normal-sized spleen show safe procedure , result short hospital stay , low postoperative pain score , technical hurdle , result , difficult . LS advantage open splenectomy ( 7 ) , consider many surgeon procedure choice normal-sized spleen . Splenectomy giant spleen use solely laparoscopic approach feasible , time consume challenge surgeon despite high level experience laparoscopy . With increased splenic size , LS become technically challenging , although procedure still feasible ( 8,5 ) . Hand-assisted laparoscopic technique allow surgeon place one hand abdominal cavity maintain pneumoperitoneum , recover tactile sense improve accuracy manipulation . This verify various complicate laparoscopic procedure , include colectomies , nephrectomy , hepatectomies . Based experience , HALS may well suit removal splenomegaly final spleen weight great 500 g ( 9 ) . It would interest ass whether outcome HALS hybrid technique approximate obtain laparoscopy open approach . Since comparative study laparoscopy HALS already carry , compare open splenectomy HALS splenomegaly case . To knowledge , first prospective study compare result HALS OS . MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study include 27 patient undergoing splenectomy splenic disorder Department General Surgery , Istanbul Medical Faculty February 2007 October 2007 . Patients select randomly accord number random table assign one two different surgical procedure . Twenty-seven patient splenomegaly primary splenic tumor include study . The patient divide two group accord surgical procedure perform : open splenectomy ( Group 1 : OS , n=14 ) hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy ( Group 2 : HALS , n=13 ) . The study plan review approved institutional ethical committee , informed consent obtain patient . Non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( n=11 ) main indication splenectomy study . There also rarely encountered primary splenic hemangioma ( n=2 ) ( Table 1 ) . Splenomegaly identify clinically palpation spleen coastal margin and/or radiological examination computerize tomography ( CT ) scan ( 15 cm long craniocaudal diameter ) , final intact splenic weight ≥ 500 g. The study parameter include age , sex , great splenic diameter , preoperative platelet count , preoperative hematocrit level postoperative diagnosis . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) calculate ratio weight ( kg ) divide height square ( m2 ) . All patient evaluate American Society Anesthesiology ( ASA ) score ( 10 ) . Operative data include operative time measure first skin incision application dressing , intraoperative blood loss , splenic weight intact removal , conversion , pain score , postoperative length hospital stay . Complications classify intraoperative postoperative . The pain patient score postoperative day . The visual analogue scale define Wewers ( 11 ) use evaluation degree pain . All patient vaccinate pneumococci Pneumovax 23 ( Merck &amp; Co Inc. , Whitehouse Station , NJ , USA ) two week operation . All patient receive antibiotic prophylaxis ( Sulbactam ampicillin 1 g , intravenously ) . All patient receive general anesthesia surgery standardize analgesic regimen . HALS OS perform surgical team . Post-operative analgesia achieve patient-controlled analgesia via pump contain standard narcotic analgesic solution . All patient receive non-steroidal antinflammatory drug ( lornoxicam 8 mg , twice day , intravenously ) narcotic analgesic ( pethidine 50 mg , twice day , intramuscularly ) first second postoperative day . Surgery Open Surgery ( Group 1 ) Patients place supine position . Since patient splenomegaly , preferred incision leave subcostal . Only three patient require synchronous cholecystectomy upper midline laparotomy incision ( 18 cm , 18 cm 20 cm length ) . After routine whole abdominal exploration , assistance abdominal retractor first assistance , inferior pole medial splenogastric ligament dissect first , splenorenal ligament superior pole splenophrenic ligament dissect . The LigaSure vessel seal system ( Valleylab division Tyco Healthcare , Mansfield , MA ) use majority dissection . After , splenic vascular pedicule separate pancreatic tail careful dissection . In splenomegaly case , splenic perisplenic anatomy appropriate , ideal ligation splenic hilum outside abdomen ( Figure 1 ) . The splenic artery splenic vein ligate silk ( 00 ) section . In case massive splenomegaly , main truncus splenic artery ligate dissection minimize blood loss allow return blood inside spleen back circulation . Figure 1- Splenic hilum ligation outside abdominal cavity After removal spleen , hemostasis rechecked , aspirative drain routinely place . The abdominal wall close loop polydioxanone ( : 1 ) two layer run suture . HALS procedure ( Group 2 ) Patients place semilateral position leave side elevate 30˚ . The surgeon stand patient ' right side camera operator . First , hand port incision make upper midline ( Figure 2 ) . The incision measure 7-8 cm ( depend size surgeon 's glove ) case . Then , hand-assisted device Omniport ( Advanced Surgical Concepts , Co. Wicklow , Ireland ) instal . Figure 2- Omniport place 8 cm upper midline incision HALS technique The surgeon 's left ( non-dominant ) hand place abdominal cavity device . The 10-mm 30˚ laparoscope place inferior superior crease umbilicus depend spleen size location . The 10-mm main operating port midclavicular line level umbilicus . Carbon dioxide insufflate continuously 13 mmHg constant pneumoperitoneum . An intraabdominal exploration accessory spleen first step . LigaSure use . With assistance intraabdominal hand , inferior pole medial splenogastric ligament dissect first , splenorenal ligament superior pole splenophrenic ligament dissect . Then , splenic vascular pedicule separate pancreatic tail finger dissection . The splenic artery splenic vein either ligate LigaSure silk ( 00 ) section dissect endo vascular stapler ( Endo-GIA ) . In case massive splenomegaly , splenic artery ligate dissection gain enough operative space ; also case LS . Finally , spleen place retrieval bag extract intact via hand port incision . Routinely , suction drain place splenic fossa . Statistical analysis Data report mean ± SD . The analysis perform statistical package SPSS 10.1 ( SPSS , Chicago , IL ) . Differences variable compare nonparametric Mann Whitney-U Student 's chi-square test . Spearman correlation analysis perform patient . Results consider statistically significant two-tailed p value less 0.05 . DISCUSSION In 1991 , Delaitre et al . attempt first laparoscopic LS ( 12 ) . Since , laparoscopic approach splenectomy gain wide acceptance show several group technically successful , safe , effective procedure . LS consider standard approach remove normal-sized spleen patient without contraindication . In case splenomegaly , LS also feasible experienced hand , , larger-sized spleen make operative space narrow , exposure limit , manipulation difficult , LS procedure become technically challenging . The hypervascularization dense adhesion around spleen hamper surgeon 's performance well . Moreover , dissection complete , extraction giant spleen solely laparoscopic approach place retrieval bag follow morcellation difficult , add considerable time procedure . Some study suggest LS splenomegaly associate long operation time , blood loss , high intraoperative postoperative complication rate LS normal-sized spleen ( 13 ) . In addition , case splenomegaly , conversion inevitable requirement intact specimen pathologic examination serious hypervascularization dense adhesion result massive size ( 14 , 15 ) . Targarona et al . ( 14 ) indicate conversion rate correlate spleen weight : spleen weigh 400 - 1000 g , 0 , rise 25 % weight &gt; 1000 g 75 % weight &gt; 3000 g. In LS group , conversion laparoscopy-assisted splenectomy occur four patient ( 25 % ) , include one case ( spleen weight 1600 g ) pathologic examination determine sarcoma three case complicate procedure due spleen weight &gt; 3000 g ( 16 ) . The median splenic weight HALS group 800 ( 480-2110 ) g ; conversion OS .</detailed_description>
