	<brief_title>Warfighter Head Injury Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Warfighter Head Injury Study ( WHIS ) comprehensive , multidisciplinary research study head-injured warfighters conduct National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Bethesda , Maryland . The goal WHIS include provide clinician scientist new insight short term recovery function follow traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , role prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) executive social function , identify good predictor short term outcome ( include cognitive , neurological , genetic factor ) . With assistance Department Veterans Affairs/Veterans Health Administration ( VA/VHA ) , propose contact Iraqi-Afghan ( IA ) warfighters penetrate head injury ( PHI ) , cohort blast injured warfighters , group match ( time service , combat exposure , age , gender , preinjury Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery [ ASVAB ] score ) healthy warfighter control well healthy volunteer different blast exposure ( i.e . : explosive expert , artillery operator , etc ) documentation brain injury . We inquire willingness participate comprehensive , multidisciplinary outpatient evaluation conduct NIH . In addition IA warfighters , also plan enroll Vietnam warfighters include W. F. Caveness Vietnam Head Injury Study ( VHIS ) Registry , order conduct detailed comparison group . These cohort represent unique opportunity study ; healthy employed injury , preinjury intelligence test available , VA/VHA permit long-term follow-up . We previously investigate Vietnam warfighters PHI publish result study change management evaluation head-injured warfighters , contribute knowledge brain function long-term effect head injury . Furthermore , base knowledge acquire previous research Vietnam warfighters current interest function human PFC , cognitive neuroplasticity young brain , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , posttraumatic epilepsy ( PTE ) , caregiver stress , genetic-plasticity relationship , propose series new cognitive neuroscience experiment battery standardize neuropsychological testing conduct WHIS . In effort , experimental testing complement structural imaging ( magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] compute tomography [ CT ] ) , diffusion tensor perfusion imaging , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) , molecular genetics evaluation . This combination unique patient , cut edge cognitive neuroscience experiment state art technique lead new scientific knowledge improve clinical management warfighters TBI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>TBI PATIENTS : We study 320 headinjured IA warfighters ( 200 PHI 120 blast injury ) , serve Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) , 500 include VHIS Registry . PHI make 20 % total TBI OIF OEF . We ask WHIS patient travel NIH primary caregiver serve Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) ( see Section X information DPA ) ; Caregivers ask complete questionnaire execute separate consent ( see Caregiver Consent Form ) . Inclusion active duty military personnel essential study complete without , necessary . INCLUSION : Both sex include , however expect cohort overwhelmingly ( &gt; 90 % ) male , Age range1875 ; At least 6 month posthead injury ; Those patient previously participate VHIS . EXCLUSION : Any medical condition , judgment investigator , would make participation detrimental patient ( e.g . : severe clinical depression , unstable heart disease ) . CONTROLS : We recruit 50 VHIS control , 200 healthy IA warfighter control subject , history neurologic serious psychiatric disorder medical condition would pose risk participation ( e.g. , unstable heart disease ) 120 healthy volunteer different exposure documentation brain injury . An example latter group would include someone might employ teacher proper use explosive device ( i.e . trainer Bureau Alcohol , Tobacco Firearms ) function well position except occasional complaint . We recruit total 370 normal volunteer . We ask WHIS control travel NIH companion , one deem close term relationship ( i.e.spouse , child , etc . ) , serve control participant caregiver warfighters . Companions ask complete questionnaire execute separate consent ( see Caregiver/Companion Consent Form ) . INCLUSION : Control subject healthy IA warfighter volunteer match headinjured IA warfighters time service , combat exposure , age , gender preinjury ASVAB score . All IA warfighter control participant must provide copy ASVAB induction test score , applicable ; Individuals different blast exposure ( e.g. , explosives expert ) documentation brain injury ; Those warfighter control previously participate VHIS . EXCLUSION : Neurological psychiatric condition mention ; History drug abuse ; Unable travel independently . CAREGIVERS/COMPANIONS : We enroll caregiver companion ( i.e . : family member , domestic partner , etc . ) WHIS Warfighter participant order learn potential burden relate issue experience group . INCLUSION : Provides care Warfighter , Chosen control participant close companion ; Their Warfighter provide informed consent agree participate WHIS project . EXCLUSION : Inability provide informed consent ; No work knowledge English language .</criteria>
