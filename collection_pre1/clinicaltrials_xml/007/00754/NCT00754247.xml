	<brief_summary>Keloids think result derailment typical wind heal process follow cutaneous injury . Current treatment option keloid include intralesional corticosteroid , silicone gel sheeting , compression , surgery adjuvant surgery , include radiation cryotherapy . 0.5 % hydrocortisone , silicone , vitamin E lotion ( HSE ) onion extract gel ( OE ) widely use over-the-counter medication treatment keloid hypertrophic scar . However , efficacy safety compare blind , placebo-controlled , prospective fashion . This study undertaken determine efficacy safety HSE versus OE versus placebo ( Cetearyl alcohol ; CEA ) subject hypertrophic scar keloid . This investigator-blinded study , mean doctor evaluate know receive study medication . Another doctor supply medication discuss problem may medication . You assign one three treatment group : HSE , OE , CEA . The group assign chance two three chance receive treatment study medication , HSE OE . The treatment group receive CEA , bland lotion , contain active ingredient steroid , silicone , vitamin E , onion extract .</brief_summary>
