	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Belotecan may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving belotecan together cisplatin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well belotecan work give together cisplatin treat patient previously untreated extensive stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Belotecan Cisplatin Treating Patients With Previously Untreated , Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess antitumor efficacy , term objective response rate , belotecan hydrochloride cisplatin patient previously untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer . Secondary - To assess additional evidence antitumor activity measure overall progression-free survival patient . - To determine safety tolerability drug combination patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive cisplatin IV day 1 belotecan hydrochloride IV day 2-4.Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
