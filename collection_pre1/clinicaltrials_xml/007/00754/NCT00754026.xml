	<brief_title>Insertion Distance Interscalene Perineural Catheters Context Shoulder Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain follow shoulder surgery report severe 70 % patient , major concern hospitalise ambulatory surgery patient . Pain control particularly important , adequate analgesia allow rapid mobilisation operate shoulder prevents complication related immobility . Several method propose treat pain , promise interscalene nerve block . The injection local anesthetic reduces sensation shoulder provide well pain relief surgery narcotic medication . To prolong duration analgesia , catheter must position next brachial plexus . Through catheter , small quantity local anesthetic continuously deliver several hour surgery , effectively relieve bad pain . To date , continuous interscalene nerve block show improve pain relief , reduce nausea , vomit , pruritus sleep disturbance shoulder surgery . It also reduce need opioids . Until recently , catheter technique frequently use due technical difficulty encounter catheter installation catheter displacement surgery . Due recent improvement nerve catheter localisation , catheter installation become easier , precise reliable . However , distance catheter must advance next brachial plexus order provide best pain relief remain unknown . Insertion distance could influence initial quality distribution freezing , duration , . Therefore , study design compare two catheter insertion distance , order help determine best pain relief shoulder surgery . Methods : 1 . Insertion catheter : Patients randomly assign follow group : - Group 1 : 2 cm insertion - Group 2 : 6 cm insertion The anesthesiologist insert interscalene catheter begin anesthesia surgery . The usual medication use make installation catheter comfortable . Standard non-invasive monitoring use . The exact location catheter put place identify use ultrasound machine . This device allow anesthesiologist identify various anatomical structure . A specially design needle insert next brachial plexus position confirm neurostimulator . Once adequacy needle position confirm , anesthesiologist introduce 2 cm ( Group 1 ) 6 cm ( Group 2 ) catheter needle , withdraw needle . The catheter fix place avoid displacement . Patients receive standard regional general anesthesia type surgery . 2 . Post-operative analgesia : - All patient : patient receive , interscalene catheter , continuous infusion bupivacaine 0,15 % rate 5 mL/h least 24 hour post-operatively After surgery , pain assess use verbal numeric pain scale . Patients ask fill pain intensity measurement form use 0-10 pain scale 3 , 6 24 hour surgery . - Inpatients : along infusion ; Patient Controlled Analgesia pump provide patient . - Ambulatory patient : infusion give disposable elastomeric pump . Along infusion , patient receive oral hydromorphone complete pain relief . Patients receive standard post-operative instruction use pump catheter . Telephone pager number physicians available time also provide patient . They ask record opioid use medication log first 24 hour post-operatively . Sensory block assess major nerve distribution arm 24 h surgery . Ambulatory patient invited return hospital assessment perform . 3 . Follow-up All patient receive phone call research team one week surgery ass satisfaction towards analgesia inquire potential complication interscalene block .</detailed_description>
