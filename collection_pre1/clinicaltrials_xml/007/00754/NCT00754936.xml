Elderly patient depression treat 12 week antidepressant medication commonly use clinical practice call escitalopram ( Lexapro ) . Brain electrical activity assess use electrophysiological test . Researchers interested whether brain electrical activity elderly people depression start medication tell u amongst improve antidepressant treatment extent . They also determine whether patient ' brain electrical activity 12 week medication treatment change way whether change link change severity depression .

	<detailed_description>This research study examine brain electrical activity elderly depress patient related quickly well respond antidepressant medication treatment . Brain electrical activity assess use electrophysiological test . Elderly patient depression treat 12 week antidepressant medication commonly use clinical practice call escitalopram ( Lexapro ) . Before start treatment , patient ask question depression measure severe . They also ask brain electrical activity record perform test computer screen . The question depression brain electrical recording repeat regularly 12 week treat antidepressant medication . The researcher interested see whether brain electrical activity elderly people depression start medication tell u amongst extent finally improve treatment escitalopram ( Lexapro ) . They also determine whether patient ' brain electrical activity , 12 week receive medication treatment , change way whether change link change severity depression . It hop information gain study help investigator well understand brain process associate depression successful treatment .</detailed_description>
