	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Non-Smokers Former Light Smokers With Relapsed Refractory Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine efficacy sorafenib tosylate , term 6-month progression-free survival rate , non-smokers former light smoker relapse refractory stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - To determine 1-year survival rate patient treat drug . - To assess frequency severity adverse event associate drug patient . - To investigate mutational status EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) , ALK ( anaplastic lymphoma kinase ) , ROS1 , K-Ras ( Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ) archive tumor sample patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Archived tumor tissue sample analyze mutation EGFR , ALK , ROS1 , K-Ras PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) sequencing . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
