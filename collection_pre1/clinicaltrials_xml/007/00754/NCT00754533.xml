	<brief_summary>The benefit cardiac rehabilitation clearly demonstrate . In particular exercise training recognize part modern management coronary artery disease . However method prescribe exercise-training program exercise intensity difficult determine . The objective randomise clinical trial determine whether appropriate endurance exercise training improve ventilatory threshold , exercise tolerance quality life patient coronary artery disease . Patients randomize continuous training aerobic interval training respectively : 80 % -versus maximal-workload ventilatory threshold . For patient , intensity exercise training determine first exercise test gas analysis use parameter sub maximal exercise capacity ventilatory threshold . Others parameter functional capacity also consider . Duration rehabilitation stage 7 10 week . Dyspnoea assessment maximal intensity , quality life measurement SF36 , drug event report . Maximal exercise test gas exchange measurement perform train program 6 month follow-up compare different cardio respiratory parameter two group exercise train evaluate effective endurance training program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Versus Interval Training Patients With Coronary Artery Disease : FRAXIO Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Outline training program : Duration rehabilitation course 7 10 week , 2 3 training session week , 21 session altogether . Each training session consist cycling ergometer . In interval training group , train session alternate one minute 100 % workload ventilatory threshold one minute active pause 50 % workload ventilatory threshold ; total exercise time 20 minute . In continuous training , train session last 20 minute 80 % workload ventilatory threshold . - Exercise testing : Exercise capacity measure end exercise training program 6 month follow-up . A first exercise test respiratory gas exchange perform 2 week hospitalization : baseline exercise test . The protocol consist 3-min warm workload 30 watt . At stage , workload increase 10 15 watt per min . Patients instruct maintain speed 55 65 rotation per min . Four exercise test gas analysis program cardiac rehabilitation : three maximal test ( exercise training program precise exercise intensity session , train program evaluate primary end point 6 month ) one sub maximal exercise test tenth session adjust intensity training exercise ( test stop ventilatory threshold obtain ) .</detailed_description>
