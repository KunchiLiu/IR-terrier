	<criteria>Age range : Subjects 6 10 year age screen visit ; weight &gt; = 15 kg . Sex distribution : male female . VABSII/PCRF receptive subdomain raw score &gt; = 25 expressive subdomain raw score &gt; = 61 . Clinical diagnosis Down syndrome ( DS ) subject may free trisomy 21 , Robertsonian translocation , mosaic DS Naive approve unapproved cholinesterase inhibitor ( Aricept , Exelon , Cognex , Reminyl/Razadyne , metrifonate , physostigmine ) prefer . However , prior use medication allow , provide medication discontinue least 3 month prior screen discontinue lack tolerability efficacy sole purpose enrol patient study . The exception prior use subject participate Phase II study E2020A001219 ( A2501059 ) eligible . Subjects reside community facility consistent reliable caregiver provide efficacy information subject . The subject must expect complete procedure schedule Screening Baseline visit include efficacy safety parameter . Subjects verbal able understood time prefer , use form communication , sign , symbol board device supplement his/her communication ability may enrol provided meet VABSII/PCRF receptive expressive score criterion mention . Subjects must parent , reliable caregiver agree accompany subject clinic visit , provide information subject require protocol , ensure compliance medication schedule . The parent caregiver must constant reliable informant sufficient contact subject detail knowledge subject 's adaptive functioning order able complete VABSII/PCRF accurately . The individual complete form every visit possible . Subjects good general health medical condition consider clinically significant unstable . Clinical laboratory value within normal limit abnormality consider clinically significant investigator sponsor . Subjects stable Type I ( insulindependent ) Type II diabetes eligible provide monitor regularly prior study ensure adequate glucose control . ( Adequacy control base investigator 's judgment , guide primarily glycosylated hemoglobin [ hemoglobin A1c ] &lt; 8.0 screening ; information , include record home monitoring screen fast glucose may support judgment . ) Subjects thyroid disease also may include study provide euthyroid stable treatment least 1 month prior screen . Subjects history seizure disorder allow provide stable treatment least 3 month seizure within past 6 month . Subjects independent ambulation ambulatory aid ( i.e. , walker cane , wheelchair ) ; vision hearing ( eyeglasses and/or hearing aid permissible ) sufficient achieve VABSII/PCRF minimum receptive raw score &gt; = 25 expressive score &gt; = 61 cooperate secondary efficacy evaluation study examination . Age range : Subjects &lt; 6 &gt; 10 year screen visit . Subjects active clinically significant condition , investigator 's judgment , affect absorption , distribution metabolism study medication ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease , gastric duodenal ulcer severe lactose intolerance ) ; control celiac disease allow . Subjects know hypersensitivity piperidine derivative cholinesterase inhibitor . Subjects currently receive cholinesterase inhibitor receive 3 month prior screen prior use &gt; 3 month prior screen stop lack efficacy tolerability simply enroll subject study . Also exclude subject participate Phase II study E2020A001219 ( A2501059 ) . In addition , subject may take investigational medication ( include memantine ) within 3 month prior screen . Subjects without reliable parent caregiver ( caregiver responsibility describe Inclusion Criteria ) , parent caregiver unwilling unable complete outcome measure fulfill requirement study . Subjects clinically significant obstructive pulmonary disease asthma , untreated control treatment within 3 month prior screen . Subjects recent ( &lt; = 1 year ) ongoing hematologic/oncologic disorder ( mild anemia allow ) . Evidence active , clinically significant , unstable gastrointestinal , renal , hepatic , endocrine cardiovascular system disease . Subjects current Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSMIV ) diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) current primary psychiatric diagnosis DS ( per DSMIV ) . Diagnoses secondary , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , allow . Any condition would make patient caregiver , opinion investigator , unsuitable study .</criteria>
