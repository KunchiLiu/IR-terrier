	<brief_summary>For last 20 30 year , damage control laparotomy decompressive laparotomy emerge part armamentarium treatment complex abdominal trauma , abdominal compartment syndrome , critically ill surgical patient profound acidosis . While advance save life , also lead dramatic increase patient open abdominal cavity . Various method employ offer protection viscera time , encourage gradual closure abdominal fascia . Some technique include Bogota bag , vacuum pack describe Barker , Wittman patch , use vacuum assist fascia-closure , include commercially available system offer KCI . Overall , abdominal closure rate approximately 50 % 90 % average 10 day . Unfortunately , well-designed comparison study available . Some best result also require return operating room every 3 5 day . At University Kentucky Medical Center , combination vacuum pack dress described Barker , commercially available VAC system ( V.A.C . ; KCI International , San Antonio , TX ) vicryl mesh closure system use . The primary fascial closure rate approximately 50 % . It standard practice take patient OR every 3-5 day routinely . Recently , new FDA list system ( ABRA Canica ) introduce use progressive tension system novel approach management open abdomen . ABRA provide dynamic reduction full thickness , severely retracted midline abdominal defect goal maintain restore primary closure option . This subdermal method use button anchor elastomer gradually pull wound margin together . Tension set adjust accord desired outcome ; stabilize retract wound , reduce wound , close wound prevent wound dehiscence ( Attachment 1 : Company brochure ) . Currently one publish case report success device . We hope first center prospectively report series patient open abdomen manage new ABRA system . In study , system use combination standard therapy use abdominal wound closure University Kentucky Medical Center . This system call V.A.C system ( V.A.C . ; KCI International , San Antonio , Tx ) . This therapy provide active exudate management containment , assist reduce abdominal volume add structural stabilization adipose tissue . Although highly power study do establish data performance , individual experience several institution reach fascial closure rate higher 70 % use ABRA device . One institution Las Vegas , Nevada use ABRA device combination VAC system experience 100 % closure rate date 12 patient . The purpose study collect information ABRA system combination VAC technique University Kentucky Medical Center . It belief use system improve fascial closure rate thereby produce less chance hernia reduce long period open abdominal wound . The objective study evaluate novel approach closure open abdomen utilize Canica ABRA system combine K.C.I . VAC System KCI VAC System alone .</brief_summary>
