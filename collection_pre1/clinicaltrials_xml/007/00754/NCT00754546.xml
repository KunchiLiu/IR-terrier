	<brief_summary>Previous study suggest treadmill exercise may relevant exercise stimulus cycle ergometer demonstrate benefit bronchodilator therapy patient COPD . The hypothesis study patient COPD exhibit great improvement exercise endurance breathlessness arformoterol compare normal saline treadmill walk cycle exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Bronchodilation Cycle v Treadmill Exercise Endurance Time COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomize trial crossover consecutively recruit patient symptomatic COPD . Each patient participate seven visit 3-4 week period . At first visit patient provide informed consent familiarize equipment test protocol . At visit 2 3 patient inhale 2 puff albuterol HFA MDI , perform symptom limit incremental exercise treadmill cycle ergometer ( randomized order ) ; one hour rest , patient perform constant work exercise 80-85 % peak VO2 exercise mode . At visit 4 - 7 , patient perform PFTs baseline 30 120 minute inhale arformoterol normal saline ( randomized order ) constant work exercise treadmill cycle ergometer ( randomized order ) . Metabolic measurement make throughout exercise , patient provide continuous rating breathlessness leg discomfort use system consist computer , monitor , mouse .</detailed_description>
