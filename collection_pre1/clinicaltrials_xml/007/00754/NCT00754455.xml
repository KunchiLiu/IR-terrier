	<brief_summary>A Phase 2a Randomized , Double Blind , Placebo Controlled Trial Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity Seasonal Influenza Virus-Like Particle ( VLP ) Vaccine ( recombinant ) Healthy Adults . Study Objectives : Primary : - To assess tolerability safety Influenza VLP Vaccine - To assess immunogenicity Influenza VLP Vaccine measure hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody titer three component viral strain Secondary : - To evaluate cross-strain immunogenicity Influenza VLP Vaccine measure hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody titer drift strain - To quantify antibody neuraminidase hemagglutinin follow administration Influenza VLP Vaccine - To assess cell-mediated immune ( CMI ) responses Influenza VLP Vaccine quantify interferon-gamma ( IFNg ) Granzyme-B produce peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase 2a randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety , tolerability immunogenicity three dose level ( low , middle high ) Influenza VLP Vaccine placebo healthy adult ( 18 49 year age ) . Eligible subject provide blood sample baseline evaluation immunological measure follow single intramuscular ( IM ) injection Influenza VLP Vaccine placebo ( Day 1 ) . Subjects monitor clinic period least 30 minute follow vaccination occurrence adverse event include local injection site reaction systemic response . For 7 day follow vaccination begin day vaccination , subject maintain symptom diary daily record injection-site reaction well generalize systemic reaction include measurement body temperature . Clinic staff contact subject telephone 2 day post vaccination ( Day 3 ) check adverse event answer question relate collection symptom diary information . Subjects return clinic 7 day follow vaccination ( Day 8 ) safety evaluation include review diary card information . A subset subject additionally return clinic 10-14 day follow vaccination ( Days 11-15 ) provide blood sample evaluation cell-mediated immune ( CMI ) response . All subject return clinic 21 day follow injection ( Day 22 ) safety evaluation provide blood sample measurement humoral immunological parameter . A final safety evaluation ( telephone contact ) occur approximately 6 month follow vaccination ( Day 181 ) . The study conduct parallel group design total approximately 300 subject ( 18 49 year age ) randomly assign one 4 treatment arm ( high , middle , low placebo ) 2:2:1:1 ratio . The following summary subject allocation treatment : Subject Allocation Treatment Condition Number Subjects High dose vaccine/ 0.5 mL - 100 Middle dose vaccine/ 0.5 mL - 100 Low dose vaccine/ 0.5 mL - 50 Placebo ( 0.5 mL ) - 50</detailed_description>
