	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Assess Acute Toxicity Quality Life Patients With Carcinoma Anal Canal Receiving Chemotherapy Radiation Using Helical Tomotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II study use tomotherapy radiation treatment delivery along concurrent 5-FU/mitomycin C treatment T2-T4 cancer anal canal . They hypothesis helical tomotherapy could minimize radiation relate toxicity avoid limit dos structure small bowel , external genitalia , skin , bladder , rectum , femoral neck head . This expected limit reduce treatment related toxicity hence prevent reduce treatment break . This may result delivery radical treatment well local control treatment outcome use current radiation treatment technique center .</detailed_description>
