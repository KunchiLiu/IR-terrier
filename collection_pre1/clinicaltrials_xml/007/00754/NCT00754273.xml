	<detailed_description>Hospital acquire pneumonia ( HAP ) second-most common nosocomial infection hospital common intensive care unit1 . Mortality HAP exceed 20 % 2 . Although mechanical ventilation great risk factor increase risk die HAP , organisms responsible cause pneumonia give ICU regardless whether patient intubated3 . Staphylococcus aureus become leading pathogen responsible hospital-acquired pneumonia ( HAP ) responsible 20 % cases4 . Staphylococcus aureus may either sensitive resistant oxacillin/methicillin . Oxacillin resistance rate increase nationwide average rate resistance oxacillin currently exceed 52 % nationwide5 . While `` MRSA '' isolate UK represent 47 % staph aureus isolate , rate methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) may approach 80 % institution ( unpublished observation ) . Presence absence risk factor MRSA determine whether MRSA drug therapy used7 . If patient think pneumonia posse risk factor MRSA , antimicrobial therapy active MRSA use empirically `` de-escalated '' objective culture data demonstrate MRSA . Empiric culture-based therapy MRSA HAP include one following : 1 ) glycopeptide vancomycin 2 ) oxazoladinone linezolid ( Zyvox® ) . Antimicrobials activity MRSA currently license indication use HAP include : 3 ) glycylcycline , tigecycline ( Tygacil® ) 4 ) streptogramin , quinupristin-dalfopristin ( Synercid® ) . Vancomycin primary antimicrobial choice MRSA HAP worldwide . Vancomycin relatively inexpensive per-dose pricing , generally effective favorable safety profile . However , staph aureus isolate incompletely sensitive even resistant vancomycin reported8 . These vancomycin-intermediately sensitive staph aureus ( VISA ) vancomycin-resistant staph aureus ( VRSA ) isolate rare increase prevalence9 . Since first report VISA United States 1999 , report document existence staph aureus isolate incomplete sensitivity vancomycin , term vancomycin `` heteroresistance '' 9 . Heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate sensitive staph aureus ( hetero-VISA , hVISA , hGISA ) isolate prevalent colony vancomycin susceptible isolates demonstrate phenotype intermediate resistant vancomycin9 . Hetero-VISA propose etiology vancomycin treatment failure patient . These hetero-VISA isolates may exhibit vancomycin-susceptibility analyze automated test automated system incapable identify rare hetero-VISA colony form unit ( CFU 's ) within single large inoculums10 . Without plat detailed testing , true incidence hetero-VISA isolates may underestimate . No large direct comparison automate non-automated MRSA isolate sensitivity vancomycin report . This investigation seek determine prevalence hetero-VISA sputum isolates MRSA major tertiary referral center define sensitivity automate test . Adequate empiric antibiotic therapy improve outcome patient pneumonia11-13 . Conversely , inadequate empiric therapy worsen outcome compare adequate therapy . Clinicians therefore seek deliver adequate empiric antibiotic time clinical diagnosis pneumonia wait definitive culture obtained14 . This type antibiotic approach start broad reduces therapy base upon objective culture data term `` de-escalation '' therapy . De-escalation lead reduce antibiotic duration , less antibiotic administer , few occurrence second pneumonia , less mortality15 . The goal pneumonia therapy start adequately narrow objectively soon appropriate . Since adequate empiric therapy determine outcome , imperative clinician treat patient risk MRSA antimicrobial certain eradicate MRSA . Traditional therapy almost exclusively glycopeptide vancomycin emerge evidence suggest case vancomycin effective available drug . New antimicrobial emerge may exhibit superior efficacy MRSA . In 2004 , Marin Kollef et al report improved clinical cure survival patient MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) treat linezolid compare treated vancomycin ( survival odds ratio 4.6 linezolid v vancomycin ) 16 . While prevalence MRSA among Staph aureus isolates increase , vitro evidence grow resistance MRSA isolate vancomycin also increase . In vitro susceptibility test organism antimicrobial express minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) . MIC low concentration antimicrobial inhibit growth organism . That , high MIC give antimicrobial organism , great concentration drug require produce kill . Vancomycin MIC 's MRSA rising , phenomenon refer `` MIC creep '' 18 . Wang et al report mean vancomycin MIC 's MRSA UCLA ≤ 0.5ug/ml 2000 1mg/dl 2004 prevalence isolates MIC=1ug/ml 70 % 2004 v 20 % 2000 . MIC 's give isolate give patient may change time well . Webster et al report MRSA isolate MIC change ≤ 1 4ug/ml several month , demonstrate ability MRSA acquire alter resistance patterns19 . S. aureus isolates vancomycin MICs 2-8 μg/mL classify vancomycin-intermediate , isolate vancomycin MICs ≥16 μg/mL classify vancomycin-resistant Centers Disease Control20 . Clinical outcome vancomycin therapy appear correlate inversely MIC 's 0.5ug/ml , MIC 's increase , clinical outcome worsens , suggest although MIC 's ≤ 2ug/ml technically report `` Susceptible '' , clinical efficacy vancomycin may vary isolates MIC 's 0.5ug/ml isolates MIC 's 1 2ug/ml . A confounding factor determination MIC 's vancomycin antimicrobial variability MIC 's measure . MIC 's may obtain automated equipment direct visual assessment kill antimicrobial disk strip culture plate . Automated equipment historically report specific vancomycin MIC 's equal 2ug/ml . The limitation equipment vancomycin MIC 's MRSA creep upward time , automated equipment report MRSA isolate vancomycin MIC 's ≤ 2 susceptible-with distinction whether MIC 0.5 , 1 2ug/ml . Automated equipment generally report MIC 's double antimicrobial concentration . Furthermore , majority sample may contain isolates vancomycin MIC 's susceptible range , know susceptibility may vary within give sample . Some solitary organism colony-forming unit ( CFU 's ) may demonstrate phenotype vancomycin MIC 's high majority sample number small unrecognized . This variability MRSA resistance vancomycin term heteroresistance heteroresistance may contribute treatment failure . Moreover , ideal method detect address vancomycin heteroresistance S. aureus ( hVISA ) every institution laboratory yet establish . An alternative automated test use E-test strip ( AB Biodisk ) . E-tests strip increase concentration particular antimicrobial agent one pole another apply plate bacterial isolates produce tear-drop shaped area killing , great kill toward end great concentration ( Figure ) . Though cumbersome expensive automate testing , accurate assessment presence absence heteroresistance precise determination MIC 's possible E-tests compare automated testing . Determination prevalence MRSA heteroresistance vancomycin relationship E-test automate vancomycin MIC 's MRSA primary objective investigation . When combined clinical cure data , vitro evidence strongly question prudence use vancomycin empiric antimicrobial agent patient know risk MRSA , may critically ill VAP wealth study establish failure adequately treat empirically increase mortality . Determining prevalence MRSA isolate marginal susceptibility vancomycin heteroresistance primary aim investigation . An accurate measure MIC reproducibility technique current prevalence MIC 's marginally susceptible allow institution medical community determine appropriate role vancomycin empiric antimicrobial regimen patient think VAP risk MRSA .</detailed_description>
