	<brief_summary>Back pain chair use second important health factor age workforce . Besides personal suffering , postural discomfort workplace reduces performance productivity , improve raise comfort level . In attempt improve comfort reduce injury risk , ergonomic chair commonly equip lumbar support attempt support `` neutral '' spine . However , people often alter position device place arch back conform . The Logic Back support offer simple mean alter posture reduce associate strain lower back seat task support `` Effortless Neutral Position '' natural curvature low back . Although use clinically many practitioner , effectiveness yet show scientific study . The current work help understand Logic Back effective become low-cost solution reduce discomfort suffer low back pain .

Back pain chair use second important health factor age workforce . The odds ratio LBP estimate seat task 1.9721 . Prolonged monotonous , low-level mechanical load associate seated posture think provoke pain . Besides personal suffering , postural discomfort workplace reduces performance productivity , improve raise comfort level . According Corlett ( 2006 ) , lumbar support exert enough pressure spine actually change configuration . However , patient often alter posture device place arch back conform . The Logic Back support offer simple mean alter posture reduce associate strain lower back seated task promote neutral stand lordotic posture . Clinically , show support ENP natural stand lordotic posture . Although clinical applicability accept many practitioner , effectiveness improve seat comfort functional task performance yet quantify LBP patient perform seat task . This study help understand Logic Back ENP must consider plan return-to-work goal method reduce first-time injury incidence workplace .</detailed_description>
