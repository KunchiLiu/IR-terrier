	<brief_summary>Prospective , multi-center , non-randomized registry . 100 patient enrol 10 clinical site Europe . The result study compare TAXUS™ ATLAS clinical trial evaluate safety product .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>`` JACTAX '' Trial Drug Eluting Stent Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The JACTAX Drug Eluting Stent design minimize amount polymer contact vessel surface , thus potentially reduce incidence untoward side effect . The Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating Process capable exclusive coat ablumenal side pre-mounted bare metal stent . Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating proprietary formulation contain bioerodable polymer . The combination Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating Process Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating create unique microstructure surface , reduce amount require polymer .</detailed_description>
