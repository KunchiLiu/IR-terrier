	<brief_title>Multi-arm Intervention Diabetes Adherence Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonadherence medication common among patient diabetes contributes suboptimal control glycemic lipid plasma level . Adherence routinely measure clinical practice valid , feasible method readily available . The lack medication adherence information contribute clinician failure identify address patient nonadherence clinical inertia poor health outcome . Existing electronic prescribe system hold potential display medication adherence information . We propose 3-arm randomized clinical trial test effectiveness provide primary care physician ( PCPs ) adherence measurement adherence clinic improve adherence diabetic lipid-lowering drug . This adherence clinic consist pharmacist nurse train motivational interviewing ( Ml ) technique improve adherence medication . Adherence index generate link e-prescribing information pharmacy data . The trial conduct among 1,436 patient diabetes poor blood glycemic and/or lipid control . Patients randomize one follow three study arm : 1 ) Usual care - PCPs write prescription electronically provide patient adherence information Ml support ; 2 ) Intervention - PCPs provide adherence information prompt electronically use electronic prescribing system ; 3 ) Intervention - PCPs provide adherence information prompt electronically use electronic prescribing system plus physician patient receive support adherence clinic . Our intervention use theoretical behavioral framework element Chronic Care Model , Self-Determination Theory , Health Belief Model . The study use qualitative method guide intervention design implementation include process evaluation treatment fidelity measure . The intervention tailor patient ' adherence goal level . The study also evaluate cost effectiveness intervention . Patients follow 36 month . The introduction sustainable medication adherence monitoring clinical practice hold great potential improve health outcome among patient diabetes .</detailed_description>
