	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrest associate high morbidity mortality child hypothermia therapy potential beneficial child follow cardiac arrest . We track record clinical laboratory research hypothermia therapy follow cardiac arrest Hospital Sick Children begin 3-site randomized control pilot study hypothermia therapy follow cardiac arrest child fund The Hospital Sick Children Research Institute Heart Stroke Foundation Ontario . We currently expand study 11 site pilot study bridge funding American Heart Association . Recently two trial publish New England Journal Medicine demonstrate efficacy 12 hour 24 hour hypothermia therapy follow ventricular arrhythmia-induced cardiac arrest adult . The result important study suggest hypothermia therapy beneficial child follow cardiac arrest . There however important difference etiology , pathophysiology , neuropathology , therapy outcome cardiac arrest child compare adult . We need conduct pilot study hypothermia therapy follow cardiac arrest 11 Children 's Hospitals test feasibility recruitment test appropriateness inclusion/exclusion criterion prior proceed large multi-centre trial . We choose 11 large child 's hospital large cardiac arrest population track record resuscitation research improve feasibility patient recruitment pilot study . The pilot data use sample size calculation large randomize control study . It also important demonstrate enrolment important sub-group patient , place ECMO post-arrest . Patients randomize cool ECMO rapid core cooling via extracorporeal circuit rapid cooling may lead pronounced therapeutic effect .</detailed_description>
