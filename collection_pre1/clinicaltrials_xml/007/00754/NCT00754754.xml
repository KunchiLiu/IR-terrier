	<brief_title>Brain Retraction Monitoring Sensor Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During neurosurgical operation aneurysm , tumor , lesion locate skull base , surgeon must employ retract device order displace one lobe brain enough gain adequate surgical exposure . These retractor adjust hand optimize exposure . It often difficult surgeon gauge amount pressure actually apply brain placement retractor . Moreover , also possible position blade retractor inadvertently focal pressure point occur tip retractor blade brain . Thus , injury brain occur result brain retraction either force apply excessive pressure adequately distribute large enough area brain . This injury think result ischemia ( inadequate blood flow ) cause retraction , local trauma , combination . It estimate type brain retraction injury occur approximately 10 % major cranial base tumor procedures 5 % intracranial aneurysm surgery . The specific aim research identify change electrical activity brain tissue subject necessary retraction neurosurgical procedure may give forewarn imminent brain retraction injury . It anticipated information permit development guideline enable neurosurgeon take step minimize injury , i.e. , temporarily release otherwise modify brain retraction . Cerebral electrical activity , together amount retraction pressure apply , record directly tissue risk mean silastic electrode grid contain pressure monitor place surface cerebral cortex underneath retractor blade .</detailed_description>
