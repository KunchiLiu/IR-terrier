	<detailed_description>Physicians train operate complex healthcare delivery system many equip knowledge skill analyze clinical environment continually improve patient care . [ 1 ] Instead , train emphasizes clinical management individual patient . The Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education ( ACGME ) acknowledge change need physician train endorse one two novel core competency typically omit formal medical curriculum : practice-based learning improvement ( PBLI ) . [ 2,3 ] The ACGME 's PBLI competency involve six point . The overall objective resident competent investigate evaluate patient care practice , evaluate integrate scientific evidence clinic able improve practice . However , ACGME prescriptive successfully implement evaluate PBLI , establish curriculum validate assessment tool exist . [ 4 ] Efforts date develop assessment tool provide foundation , none adequately address component PBLI describe ACGME . [ 3 , 5-10 ] In particular , assessment tool attempt capture resident ' ability develop implement clinically-based CQI project involve practice set assess impact practice set and/or organization . Curriculums without focus miss importance system perspectives , opportunity interprofessional team development , meaningful impact patient care broader organizational level . After several iteration , PBLI QI curriculum address gap identify many curriculum institute . [ 11 ] The key component integration system quality improvement project could evolve several resident outpatient rotation block . Data 11 block new curriculum available analysis . Data include closed- open-ended question design assess resident PBLI application skill note presentation slide resident ' presentation internal medicine 's morbidity mortality conference ( IM MMC ) end block . Funding would make possible quickly evaluate exist preliminary data . Our overall aim evaluate preliminary data new curriculum develop assessment tool address six ACGME point provide method assess sustainability system project . The next step apply grant fully evaluate curriculum assessment tool .</detailed_description>
