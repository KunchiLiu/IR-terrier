	<brief_summary>Between 10 % 25 % newly diagnose stage IIIB/stage IV patient currently receive single agent chemotherapy regimens . A significant proportion patient elderly ( 70 year age ) many oncologist would consider intravenous vinorelbine gemcitabine standard care patient population . It demonstrate single agent vinorelbine offer therapeutic advantage select NSCLC patient best supportive care alone . Carboplatin plus Alimta acceptable toxicity profile clinical problem could acceptable use elderly patient . A randomised study perform therefore assess whether progression free survival , primary efficacy endpoint study , achieve Carboplatin plus Alimta superior achieve gemcitabine , one current standard care elderly patient advance NSCLC .</brief_summary>
