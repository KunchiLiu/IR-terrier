	<brief_summary>This imaging protocol , therapeutic study . The primary goal propose study examine utility new imaging study , Positron Emission Tomography F-18 Fluorothymidine ( FLT PET ) , early treatment evaluation head neck cancer . FLT uptake tumor correlate rate cell proliferation . It therefore hop change tumor FLT uptake therapy reflect change number actively divide tumor cell provide early assessment treatment response . Research subject undergo one PET scan FLT . The scan do prior therapeutic intervention ( radiation chemotherapy ) obtain 30 day prior start therapy . The uptake FLT tumor analyze see use predictor treatment efficacy and/or outcome . There optional biopsy component study . Should attend physician ( primarily otolaryngologists ) believe subject safely undergo outpatient biopsy , subject agrees , biopsy perform . The biopsy do within 30 day prior treatment , similar FLT PET scan . Tissue biopsy analyzed marker cellular proliferation marker correlate finding FLT PET scan . There 2-year clinical follow-up ass treatment outcome , local control , overall survival .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Subject must histologically confirm squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Subject must schedule receive combine chemoradiotherapy treatment standard cancer care . Treatment decision make treat otolaryngologist , radiation , medical oncologist . Male female ≥ 18 year age . Squamous cell cancer head neck exceedingly rare child generally applicable pediatric population . Karnofsky great equal 60 % time screening . Life expectancy great 6 month . Subject must normal organ marrow function ( define ) within 30 day study enrollment : leukocytes ≥ 3,000/μL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/μL platelets ≥ 100,000/μL total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 mg/dl* Either AST OR ALT ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal PT PTT ( biopsy perform ) &lt; 2.0 X upper normal limit The effect FLT develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A screening urine hCG administer Nuclear Medicine woman childbearing potential FLT scan pregnant woman accept subject study . Subjects chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Subject may receive investigational agent . Subject Karnofsky score 60 . Pregnant woman exclude study . FLT PET potential teratogenic effect . Because potentially unknown risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother FLT , breastfeed discontinue mother imaged FLT may resume 48 hour FLT image . Subjects take nucleoside analog medication use antiretroviral agent .</criteria>
