	<brief_title>Study Ramucirumab Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current chemotherapy use treat ovarian cancer participant include doxorubicin , topotecan , paclitaxel , mention . Doxorubicin study ovarian cancer participant refractory paclitaxel platinum-based chemotherapy agent . Inhibition angiogenesis consider promising approach treatment cancer . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) important regulator angiogenesis likely important therapeutic target persistent recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma . VEGF overexpressed ovarian tissue may important single tumor angiogenic factor . Phase 1 study currently near completion ramucirumab demonstrate safety tolerability clinically relevant dos , preliminary evidence clinical efficacy ovarian cancer participant . Therefore , ImClone Systems plan conduct Phase 2 trial ass safety efficacy ramucirumab participant platinum-refractory persistent recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma .</detailed_description>

The participant concurrent active malignancy , adequately treat nonmelanomatous skin cancer noninvasive carcinoma situ neoplasm . A participant previous history malignancy eligible provide diseasefree &gt; 3 year 2 . The participant receive noncytotoxic regimen ( usually call targeted therapy bevacizumab ) recurrent persistent disease . ( Participants may receive noncytotoxic regimen primary treatment . ) 3 . The participant receive radiotherapy treatment ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer within 3 week ( 21 day ) prior first dose study medication 4 . The participant receive prior radiotherapy portion abdominal cavity pelvis treatment ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer within last 3 year . [ Prior radiation localize cancer ( example , breast , head neck , skin ) permit , provide complete &gt; 3 year prior first dose study medication , participant remain free recurrent metastatic disease . ] 5 .
