	<brief_title>A Long-term Extension Study Tocilizumab ( Myeloma Receptor Antibody MRA ) Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective extension study ass long-term safety 8 mg/kg tocilizumab regard adverse event ( AEs ) laboratory result abnormality . The secondary objective follow : - To explore possibility reduce concomitant steroid treatment - To determine long-term efficacy 8 mg/kg tocilizumab regard reduction sign symptom - To good understand predict tocilizumab efficacy , response , safety , progression rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) associate disease regard effect biomarkers No viable biomarkers TCZ treatment effect identify controlled study . There , therefore , biomarkers warrant investigation long-term study , biomarker data report . The extension study WA18695 open-label , international multi-center study patient moderate severe active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) complete treatment 24 week placebo-controlled Phase III study WA17822 . Patients enter WA17822 inadequate response methotrexate ( MTX ) , , WA17822 , patient receive treatment intravenous infusion tocilizumab 4 mg/kg , 8 mg/kg , placebo every 4 week background MTX therapy . All patient complete planned course treatment escape therapy WA17822 study eligible enter WA18695 long-term extension study , assign treatment 8 mg/kg RoActemra/Actemra plus MTX . The dose RA medication MTX nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , exclude corticosteroid , keep stable first 48 week WA18695 study . During time dose reduction treatment allow clinically require safety reason . After week 48 , administration disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) NSAIDs could change , accord investigator 's practice tolerate patient .</detailed_description>
