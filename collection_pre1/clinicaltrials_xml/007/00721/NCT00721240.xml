	<brief_title>Investigation Identify Predictors Response Treatment With Montelukast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leukotriene antagonist ( montelukast ) particularly effective controller exposure allergen ( Leff 1998 ) . The applies treatment bronchoconstriction induce physical exertion cold air ( Richter 2000 ) . Montelukast bind cysteinyl leuko¬triene-1 receptor , prevents leukotriene bind . Leukotrienes play key role mediator inflammatory process . By bind receptor cause , among thing , edema , damage bronchial epithelium bronchoconstriction . Accordingly , addition anti-inflammatory activity montelukast bring bronchial dilation . The safety efficacy drug child well document ( Knorr 1998 ) . Hence montelukast approved treatment bronchial asthma child ( six month age ) . As antiasthmatic drug , responder nonresponders leukotriene receptor antagonist . The proportion nonresponders montelukast among child esti¬mated 30 % 40 % . At present way distinguish non-responders responder run treatment trial several week . If symptom score fall , use beta2 sympathomimetics reduce , pulmonary function and/or quality life improve , assume patient responder . This method tedious also unsafe , since change aforementioned parameter could occur spontaneously , without reliably attributable influence drug . In planned study approximately 30 child asthma GINA class 2 3 regularly examine pulmonary function , symptom score nitrogen monoxide ( NO ) . First , however , acute pharmacologic effect single dose montelukast deter¬mined period four hour measure pulmonary function level exhale nitrogen monoxide ( NO ) . 4.2.1 . Questions address : Is possible discriminate responder nonresponders early stage basis acute pharmacologic effect montelukast ? Does classification agree result 12 week treatment ? 4.2.2 . Hypothesis : Patients show bronchospasmolytic effect functional pulmonary test ( FEV1 increase least 5 % ) within four hour take montelukast also show positive response ( defined combination least two variable ( see section definition responders/non-responders treatment ) ) 12 week treatment . Conversely , patient show acute effect positive response long-term therapy . In word , result acute pharmacologic effect correspond effect long-term therapy . 5 . Aim study : The main aim study develop method allow responder distinguish non-responders long-term treatment initiate . Subsidiary aim record change pulmonary functional parameter , NO concentration peak flow variability , use beta2 sympathomimetics asthma symptom score . 6 . Patient selection : The study include approximately 30 patient age 6 14 year diagnose bronchial asthma constant anti-inflammatory therapy least four week ( GINA class 2 3 ) . 7 . Study design : This investigation single-center , two-phase , single-arm study . In order detect potential placebo effect , treatment phase precede single-blinded two-week placebo run-in phase , follow 12 week open-label treatment phase .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children adolescents symptomatic bronchial asthma despite ongoing therapy Age 614 year Asthma diagnose lease six month previously ( special pulmonary allergologic outpatient unit ) Demonstration reversibility ( FEV1 increase least 12 % bronchospasmolysis beta2 sympathomimetic ) . This determine screen visit within previous three month . Patients either steroidnaive receive constant dos follow medi¬cations within previous four week : Beclomethasone dipropionate : 400 µg daily Fluticasone propionate : 200 µg daily Budesonide : 400 µg daily Patients able reliably complete asthma diary perform peak flow measurement accord instruction . Girls childbearing potential must acceptable method contraception , include sexual abstinence . Patients treat systemic steroid within previous 30 day Patients use one follow asthma medication : Systemic steroid Nedocromil , DNCG Theophylline Ketotifen Systemic longacting beta2 sympathomimetics Patients experience one follow event within previous 30 day : A change asthma medication Pulmonary infection Hospitalization due bronchial asthma respiratory condition Patients currently participate another clinical trial do within previous 30 day .
