	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , cisplatin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy together cetuximab radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give docetaxel , cisplatin , fluorouracil together cetuximab radiation therapy work treat patient locally advanced head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel , Cisplatin , Fluorouracil Followed By Cetuximab Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate progression-free survival patient locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck treat induction chemotherapy comprise docetaxel , cisplatin , fluorouracil follow concurrent cetuximab radiotherapy . Secondary - Assess objective response rate patient treat regimen . - Assess best overall response rate , overall survival , local-regional control , distant failure patient treat regimen . - Assess acute long-term toxicity associate regimen patient . - Assess quality life swallow patient treated regimen . - Determine accuracy PET/CT scan evaluate objective response ; detect residual disease primary site node ; guide recommendation salvage surgery neck dissection ; early detection recurrent metastatic disease . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord nodal status ( N2b-c N3 v N0-2a ) , tumor characteristic invasiveness ( present v absent ) , human papilloma virus ( HPV ) status ( positive v negative ) , primary tumor site ( hypopharynx v larynx v oropharynx ) . Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprise docetaxel IV 1 hour cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-4 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 3-4 week completion induction chemotherapy , patient receive cetuximab IV weekly 7 week . Beginning 1 week first dose cetuximab , patient undergo concurrent intensity-modulated radiotherapy conventional 3-dimensional radiotherapy twice daily 5-6 day week 6 week . Patients persistent disease undergo salvage resection primary tumor and/or neck dissection approximately 3 month completion radiotherapy . Patients undergo quality life swallow evaluation periodically . Patients undergo PET/CT scan baseline , begin radiotherapy , 6-8 week completion study treatment , every 6 month 5 year , annually thereafter . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 8 week , every 2 month 2 year , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
