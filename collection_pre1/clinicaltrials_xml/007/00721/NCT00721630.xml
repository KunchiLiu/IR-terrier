	<brief_summary>HER2 protein sit surface breast cancer cell people . Because one people , breast cancer call `` HER2-positive . '' The HER2 protein involve growth breast cancer . Certain drug interfere ability HER2 protein cause breast cancer growth . Trastuzumab one drug . You must already receive trastuzumab treatment breast cancer consider study . Other drug study woman HER2-positive breast cancer . Lapatinib ( Tykerb™ ) block signal stimulate HER2-positive breast cancer grow . The FDA approve lapatinib use capecitabine ( Xeloda™ ) patient metastatic breast cancer grow spread treatment trastuzumab . Capecitabine approve FDA 1998 treat metastatic breast cancer . Capecitabine pill block way cancer cell multiply grow . Usually , medicine take twice day fourteen day . Then , patient take pill seven day . With schedule dose , patient side effect interfere comfort . We use mathematical model recommend new schedule capecitabine . In animal , 7 day treatment capecitabine follow 7-day break safer active breast cancer . The purpose study find effect ( good bad ) capecitabine breast cancer give new schedule combine lapatinib .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients diagnosis invasive adenocarcinoma breast confirm histology cytology MSKCC . Clinical evidence metastatic breast cancer . HER2 overexpression and/or amplification determine immunohistochemistry ( 3+ ) FISH ( ≥2.0 ) . Progressive disease follow treatment trastuzumab metastatic breast cancer adjuvant therapy ( either singleagent combination therapy ) Prior therapy inclusion : No two prior chemotherapy regimens allow advanced stage disease No prior fluoropyrimidine metastatic setting . Adjuvant fluoropyrimidine permit &gt; 6 month prior treatment study . No restriction prior hormonal therapy . No concurrent use endocrine therapy permit . No 450mg/m2 cumulative dose prior doxorubicin At least 3 week since prior chemotherapy radiation therapy Age ≥ = 18 . Because dose adverse event data currently available use lapatinib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Patients must willing discontinue sex hormonal therapy e.g. , birth control pill , ovarian hormonal replacement therapy , etc. , prior enrollment . Women childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception treatment reasonable period thereafter . Negative HCG pregnancy test premenopausal woman reproductive capacity woman less 12 month menopause . Asymptomatic , central nervous system metastasis permit patient remain clinically stable discontinuation corticosteroid anticonvulsant . ECOG performance status &lt; = 2 Life expectancy great 12 week Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ = 3,000/μL absolute neutrophil count ≥ = 1,500/μL platelet ≥ = 100,000/μL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ = 2.5x institutional upper limit normal serum creatinine within normal institutional limit Cardiac ejection fraction lower limit normal 50 % measure multigated radionuclide angiography ( MUGA ) scan . If LVEF great 70 % , ECHO perform well . Baseline treatment scan perform use modality preferably institution . Ability understand willingness sign write inform . consent document . Able swallow retain oral medication . Patients may receive concurrent anticancer therapy investigational agent intention treat breast cancer . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition lapatinib capecitabine . Known DPD deficiency . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within 6 month study entry , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study lapatinib member 4 anilinoquinazoline class kinase inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother lapatinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated lapatinib . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction lapatinib . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients GI tract disease result inability take oral medication , malabsorption syndrome , requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's , ulcerative colitis ) . Concomitant requirement medication classify CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor : Medications inhibit induce CYP3A4 prohibit . Eligibility patient receive medication substance know affect , potential affect activity pharmacokinetics lapatinib determine follow review use Principal Investigator . Renal function measure creatinine clearance &lt; 30ml/min Patients permitted participate nontherapeutic clinical trial receive treatment study ( ie , experimental imaging , minor procedure necessary tissue acquisition study )</criteria>
