	<brief_summary>Of ~700,000 person suffer stroke year , 50 % recover ability perform unlimited community walking . One mechanism contribute locomotor dysfunction post-stroke increase metabolic cost walk relative neurologically healthy individual 2-4 . This increase cost likely limit amount walk perform , reduce functional capacity , thus contribute long-term spiral disability decrease quality life person . In addition increase metabolic cost , increase estimate mechanical work also characteristic hemiparetic walk 2,29 . Interestingly , although estimate mechanical work reflect work do locomotor muscle , little known impact peripheral muscle property estimate mechanical work . Furthermore , question concern property relate increase metabolic cost walk remain unanswered . The short-term objective purpose propose research determine extent peripheral muscle characteristic , well estimate muscle mechanical energy expenditure ( MMEE ) , relate metabolic cost walk post-stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A guide principle propose research skeletal muscle building block movement , , muscle dysfunction ultimately limit gain possible rehabilitation intervention . Therefore , maximal gain make central nervous system adaptation access peripheral muscle fully capable support increased activity . The primary hypothesis person hemiparesis follow stroke , alteration metabolic property peripheral skeletal muscle , combination great mechanical work , contribute increase metabolic cost walking . A secondary hypothesis locomotor training induces adaptation low extremity skeletal muscle result improved mechanical metabolic efficiency . In order test hypothesis , follow three specific aim address : Aim 1 : Determine in-vivo metabolic characteristic ankle plantar flexor muscle person chronic post-stroke hemiparesis neurologically healthy individual . In-vivo muscle metabolic property assess via phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31P-MRS ) . Specifically , measure rest phosphorylation potential well in-vivo oxidative capacity ankle plantar flexor muscle . We hypothesize individual chronic hemiparesis exhibit reduction oxidative capacity well increase rest phosphorylation potential relative age- , gender- , height- weight-matched control subject . We suggest adaptation , characteristic less energetically efficient muscle , contribute increase metabolic cost beyond result potential increase mechanical work perform locomotor muscle . Aim 2 : Quantify metabolic cost well muscle mechanical energy expenditure walk person chronic post-stroke hemiparesis neurologically healthy individual . Post-stroke hemiparesis associate variety motor control problem include abnormal synergistic organization movement well altered temporal sequence muscle activity 5,10,11 . Since muscle excitation normal walk believe efficient 8,9,33 likely altered muscle coordination post-stroke , reflect increased mechanical work , one factor contribute increase metabolic cost walking . We hypothesize metabolic cost walk post-stroke elevate relative control match speed . Additionally , measure mechanical work , muscle mechanical energy expenditure ( MMEE ) , elevate post-stroke , reflective mechanically inefficient movement strategy causal portion increase metabolic cost walking . Aim 3 : Determine impact 12 week locomotor train in-vivo muscle metabolic property , metabolic cost walk well MMEE person chronic post-stroke hemiparesis . There emerge evidence chronic neurologic deficit due stroke improved intensive , repetitive task-oriented motor training ( e.g . locomotor training ) . The basis locomotor training ( LT ) improvement think involve mechanisms central neuroplasticity responsive fundamental principle motor learn 37,38,39 . In addition , pilot data demonstrate LT may also result peripheral adaptation plantar flexor muscle . Thus , potential seemingly exist induce central peripheral adaptation intervention strategy . We expect LT attenuate exist deficit , result increase oxidative capacity decrease rest phosphorylation potential ankle plantar flexor muscle . In addition , LT result reduce MMEE reduce metabolic cost walking , reflective improve mechanical metabolic efficiency . We believe prove important describe adaptation walk mechanic well within peripheral muscle occur follow LT relate metabolic cost walking . In addition , continue deficit reflect need additional adjunctive intervention strategy , thus provide information modify augment future rehabilitation intervention order improve individual outcome .</detailed_description>
