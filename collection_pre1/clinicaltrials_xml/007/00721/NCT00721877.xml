	<brief_title>Resveratrol Healthy Adult Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect resveratrol human cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzyme activity healthy adult participant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine modulation effect phase II detoxification enzyme . II . To evaluate safety participant treat drug . OUTLINE : Participants receive oral resveratrol daily 4 week . Patients complete daily diary document adverse event intake calendar record daily intake non-routine medication . Participants undergo blood sample collection periodically . Lymphocytes isolate analyzed baseline GST activity level . Serum analyze determine bilirubin level use surrogate UGT 1A1 activity . Analyses CYP probe drug perform use high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) assay . A sensitive ELISA assay use quantitative analysis . Urine sample collect periodically drug metabolite level analyze . After completion study treatment , participant follow 2 week .</detailed_description>
