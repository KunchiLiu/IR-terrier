	<brief_title>Analyzing Genetic Factors Involved Blood Pressure Changes Due Salt Potassium Intake ( The GenSalt Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High blood pressure one common health problem among adult . If leave untreated , lead heart failure , kidney failure , stroke . Common cause include stress , diet , diabetes , kidney disease , obesity . Typical treatment include take medication , lose weight , quit smoking . It also recommend people high blood pressure risk develop high blood pressure modify diet decrease sodium intake increase potassium intake . Research show genetics may play role development high blood pressure may affect fluctuation blood pressure level , include blood pressure change bring sodium potassium . This study identify analyze genetic factor may responsible blood pressure change due dietary salt potassium intake . Blood sample collect study may also use future genetic research blood pressure . This study enroll people mildly elevate blood pressure sibling , spouse , child . Participants first take part 3-day observation period . At Day 1 study visit , participant ' weight , height , waist size , blood pressure measure . There three separate blood pressure measurement . Study staff interview participant collect information family personal medical history , cigarette smoking habit , alcohol consumption , physical activity , diet . Finally , blood sample collect . For 24 hour first study visit , participant collect urine . At study visit Days 2 3 , participant undergo three blood pressure measurement cold pressor test , measure blood pressure different body temperature . Participants also collect urine sample night . After 3-day observation period , participant take part 3-week treatment period . Each day , participant eat breakfast , lunch , dinner study kitchen . For Days 1 7 , participant eat low sodium diet ; Days 7 14 , participant eat high sodium diet ; Days 14 21 , participant eat high sodium diet receive potassium supplement . Blood pressure measure three time per day urine collect several time period . Blood sample collect end week . Parents participant also enrol study , complete study procedure participant complete 3-day observation period except urine collection . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
