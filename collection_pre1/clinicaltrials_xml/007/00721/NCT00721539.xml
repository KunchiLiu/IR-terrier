	<brief_title>Assessing da Vinci速 Robotic Surgical System Surgery Upper Aerodigestive Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past two decade interest minimally invasive technique transoral treatment head neck benign malignant lesion grow due decrease morbidity transoral approach , surgeon move away traditional open resection . Transoral resection neoplasm upper aerodigestive , minimally invasive nature , may afford short hospitalization recovery time patient compare patient undergo traditional `` open '' surgery . In surgery oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx , transoral endoscopic surgery provide similar outcome term local control disease compare open procedure , improve time restoration oral intake shortening time tracheostomy decannulation . Therefore , select patient , transoral surgical approach may afford clear advantage traditional open approach . Current technique , however , limited inability attain direct line site exposure lesion . Use robot-assisted technology mean overcome surgical limitation , provide surgeon improve dexterity precision , couple advance image technique three-dimensional depth perception , may allow completion transoral surgical approach patient conventional technology suboptimal . The da Vinci速 Robotic Surgical System ( Intuitive Surgical , Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA ) FDA-approved use variety laparoscopic , thoracoscopic , cardiac , urologic surgical procedure . This protocol ass use da Vinci速 Robotic Surgical System ( Intuitive Surgical , Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA ) transoral surgery patient benign malignant lesion oral cavity laryngopharynx . Traditional endoscopic removal tumor oropharynx laryngopharynx usually preferred traditional open resection decrease morbidity improve functional outcome experience patient . The limiting step procedure exposure , visualization , access candidate tumor . The da Vinci surgical system offer possibility significant improvement exposure , visualization access candidate tumor add risk patient . Overall may significantly increase number patient candidate endoscopic surgery . Alternative procedure include traditional open surgical removal tumor well traditional endoscopic removal tumor use microscope CO2 laser . Open surgical approach reserve patient large tumor unsuitable endoscopic removal endoscopic visualization tumor inadequate impossible . The da Vinci surgical system would offer improved visualization tumor might otherwise inaccessible traditional endoscopic approach . Candidate patient present neoplasm oropharynx , hypopharynx larynx . Those patient assess preoperatively candidate transoral surgery ( eg , Mallampati class I II , normal range neck motion , trismus ) undergo surgery via transoral approach resect tumor . This require general anesthesia may require postoperative hospitalization . If tumor access , resection proceed use da Vinci robot . In tumor access , resection proceed via conventional open approach . Pre postoperative care affect protocol , deal strictly manner tumor remove . Postoperative care visit standardize nature tumor ( eg , malignant tumor usually require follow-up visit every four six week monitor tumor recurrence ) . Complications , blood loss , operative time , length hospitalization , time resumption oral intake , time decannulation , overall local control rate assess postoperative period .</detailed_description>
