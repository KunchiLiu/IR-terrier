	<brief_summary>The purpose research study compare patient double-sided claudication transplant combination stem cell obtain bone marrow patient contribute formation new blood vessel one severly diseased ischemic limb ( leg ) versus control limb receive placebo product . Limb Ischemia ( LI ) severe obstruction artery seriously decrease blood flow extremity ( mainly foot leg ) progress point severe pain even skin ulcer sore . LI need comprehensive treatment since condition improve . The overall goal treatment reduce pain increase blood flow improve symptom save leg foot . In many case , current option treatment include medication , surgery endovascular procedure successful . In last year , investigator explore therapy aim increase blood flow ischemic vessel transplant cell promote development new vessel diseased leg . The study hypothesis base concept process formation new blood vessel complex require participation several type stem cell growth factor . The lack component produce vessel immature unable provide appropriate blood supply leg . Patients eligible participate study suffer double-sided claudication poor circulation severe leg blockage , candidate surgical procedure . Once mixture stem cell prepare patient 's bone marrow ready , cell transplant calf muscle one diseased leg diseased leg receive placebo . Clinical study evaluate compare efficacy stem cell transplant perform six month post cell transplant .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males female older 18 year age . Limb ischemia ABI &lt; 0.7 index low extremity two consecutive examination do least 1 week apart . Limb ischemia rest ischemic pain and/or claudication 100 meter and/or nonhealing ulcer . Claudication Patients consider candidate surgical percutaneous revascularization , due poor target vessel , inability cross total occlusion , morbidity precludes general anesthesia . Inability provide inform consent . Previous angiogenic therapy . Known sensitivity gentamycin and/or amphotericin B . Use expect use antineoplastic drug . Any illness , might affect patient 's survival enrollment protocol . Any illness significant laboratory abnormality , investigator 's judgment interfere patient 's ability comply protocol , compromise patient 's safety , interfere interpretation study result . No evidence acute infection WBC &gt; 15000 . WBC &lt; 4000 . Serum Creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL patient hemodialysis . Pregnant woman woman plan become pregnant unwilling use appropriate birth control method 2 month cell infusion . Recent myocardial infarction within 3 month prior screen .</criteria>
