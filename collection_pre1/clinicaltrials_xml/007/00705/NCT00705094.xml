	<brief_summary>For many year , researcher doctor study different kind treatment improve survival men testicular cancer . However , recent research show many year later , men testicular cancer appear high risk develop heart disease ( heart attack heart failure ) , especially receive chemotherapy . Since study do many year men receive treatment , way know factor contribute health problem experience . This study do would helpful study heart function cardiovascular disease risk factor men diagnose testicular cancer , receive chemotherapy treatment compare men receive treatment surgery alone .</brief_summary>
