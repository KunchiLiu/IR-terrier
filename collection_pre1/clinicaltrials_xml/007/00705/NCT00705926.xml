	<brief_title>Effectiveness Antiretroviral Therapy During Acute HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy treatment HIV infection remarkably successful reduce morbidity mortality HIV infect people . This treatment still shortcoming , however . Individuals receive ARV treatment risk toxicity , develop drug resistance , unknown long-term side effect . Therefore , development alternative treatment strategy important . A short course ARV treatment initiate acute period HIV infection , follow treatment cessation may substantial impact control infection delay need lifelong potent ARV therapy . The purpose study investigate whether treatment initiate acute HIV infection follow terminal treatment interruption effective lower viral load set point raise CD4 cell count people HIV , compare measure people HIV receive treatment . Participants study randomly assign one three group . Participants Group A1 receive ARV therapy 12 week . Participants Group A2 receive ARV therapy 32 week . Participants Group B receive treatment . This study provide medication group . All group follow total 72 week follow study entry . Participants attend 30 36 study visit course 72 week , depend study group . Study visit occur every week first 12 week every 1 6 week remainder study . Tests occur study visit may include blood test , investigational immune system test , pregnancy test . Participants also undergo complete physical exam ask provide information medical medication history .</detailed_description>
