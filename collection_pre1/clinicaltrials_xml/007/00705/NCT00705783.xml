	<brief_summary>The purpose trial evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability intramuscular depot formulation aripiprazole maintenance treatment patient schizophrenia . The trial design 4 treatment phase . Phase 1 design allow patient convert current antipsychotic treatment oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy ( oral conversion phase 4 6 week ) . During Phase 2 , patient stabilize oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy ( oral stabilization phase minimum 4 week maximum 12 week ) . Once patient stabilize Phase 2 , enter Phase 3 , single-blind intramuscular ( IM ) depot aripiprazole stabilization phase . The goal phase stabilize patient IM depot aripiprazole formulation minimum 12 week maximum 36 week . When patient stabilize , eligible randomize double-blind IM depot maintenance phase ( Phase 4 ) . During Phase 4 , patient assess exacerbation psychotic symptom and/or impend relapse 52 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study consist screen phase 4 treatment phase . Eligibility determine screen phase 2 42 day . Patients receive oral treatment antipsychotic non-generic aripiprazole enter Phase 1 . Patients lapse aripiprazole antipsychotic treatment time study entry ( `` lapse '' define &gt; 3 consecutive day without medication ) enter directly Phase 2 . During Phase 1 ( oral conversion ) , patient cross-titrated weekly visit antipsychotic oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy minimum 4 week maximum 6 week . During Phase 2 ( minimum 4 week maximum 12 week duration ) , patient assess bi-weekly stabilized oral dose aripiprazole range 10 mg 30 mg daily . After stability criterion meet Phase 2 , patient enter single-blind aripiprazole intramuscular ( IM ) depot stabilization phase , Phase 3 . In Phase 3 , patient stabilize aripiprazole IM depot 12 consecutive week . Once patient meet stability criterion , eligible randomize double-blind phase , Phase 4 . Patients randomize 2:1 ratio ( aripiprazole IM depot v placebo IM depot ) stratify region last aripiprazole IM depot injection dose level Phase 3 . During Phase 4 , patient assess impend relapse/exacerbation psychotic symptom . If patient identify impending relapse/exacerbation psychotic symptom , withdraw trial give opportunity enroll open-label aripiprazole IM depot trial , 31-08-248 . Patients complete Phase 4 ( include Week 52 ) option enroll open-label aripiprazole IM depot trial , 31-08-248 ( NCT00731549 ) .</detailed_description>
