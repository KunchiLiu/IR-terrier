	<brief_summary>This study compare patient adherence different colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen test identify cost-effective strategy decrease mortality CRC . We hypothesize different type test different adherence rate , rate alter cost-effectiveness analysis , identify patient variable associate non-adherence specific CRC screening strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) significant preventable disease , yet CRC screen rate remain low . Previous investigator identify barrier adherence CRC screening ; however , majority data retrospectively derive , limited data produce prospective assessment limit fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) . Constructs base Health Belief Model propose identify item associate non-adherence CRC screening , prospective validation model lack . The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force report cite major cause uncertainty calculation incremental cost-effectiveness CRC screening deficit primary data regard adherence CRC screening test , specifically whether heterogeneity exist screen rate compete strategy . The Institute Medicine confirm importance detect heterogeneity adherence strategy , understand strategy currently recommend CRC screening may dominate strategy achieve great level adherence . This study aim determine whether adherence rate CRC screen heterogeneous compete strategy ( FOBT colonoscopy ) . This study also prospectively examine domain Health Belief Model identify association non-adherence screening . Adherence rate specific tested strategy incorporate exist economic model compare incremental cost-effectiveness compete CRC screen strategy . These data greatly impact policy decision regard resource allocation CRC screening . It also expect future research base data generate project aim develop test intervention optimize adherence screening strategy decrease mortality CRC . Procedures : Patients due CRC screen meet eligibility requirement identify query electronic medical record database San Francisco General Hospital ( SFGH ) . A research assistant ( RA ) obtain PCP 's approval attempt recruitment patient 's primary care appointment . The PCP discuss CRC screen participant regularly schedule appointment . Availability CRC screen test : Because capacity constraint endoscopy unit SFGH , screen method average risk CRC limit annual fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) . However , gastroenterology department initiate pilot program allow different primary care clinic refer average-risk patient colonoscopy screen rotate 3-month time-blocks . To ensure endoscopy unit sufficient capacity provide CRC screen via colonoscopy , provider give primary care clinic able refer patient ( ) colonoscopy screening , ( b ) FOBT screening , ( c ) choice either colonoscopy FOBT screening , depend time block . This study intervention ; provider simply recommend patient complete standard CRC screen test , discus option option available . Patients decline participate study undergo colorectal cancer screen guidance primary care provider ; screen test available participate . After give write informed consent , participant complete RA-administered 20-minute survey base construct Health Belief Model . Participants also grant u approval review medical record one year determine complete screening ; without record testing contact determine complete test outside SFGH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Averagerisk subject ( family history CRC , personal history polyp CRC ) . 50 year age great , less 80 year old . Due CRC screen . Upcoming appointment schedule primary care provider . Primary care provider agree refer patient consideration enrollment study . Family history CRC firstdegree relative . Personal history colonic adenomatous polyp , CRC inflammatory bowel disease . Symptoms colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy would otherwise perform ( hematochezia , new onset diarrhea constipation , abdominal pain ) . CRC screen current ( FOBT within precede 12 month , flexible sigmoidoscopy double contrast barium enema within 5 year , colonoscopy within 10 year ) . Comorbid illness preclude endoscopic evaluation ( coronary artery disease myocardial infarction within 6 month , unstable angina congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease require home oxygen , diseases limit life expectancy le 10 year ) .</criteria>
