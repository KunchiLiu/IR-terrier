	<brief_summary>This protocol prospective , Phase I study allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) primary therapy Osteogenesis Imperfecta Types II III . Compatible sibling donor unrelated donor stratify analyzed accord type donor . All patient sibling donor receive chemotherapy condition regimen ; non-T cell deplete allogeneic marrow , GVHD prophylaxis . All patient unrelated donor receive chemoradiotherapy condition regimen , T-cell deplete allogeneic marrow , GVHD prophylaxis . The primary objective study investigate safety toxicity BMT procedures particular population .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient diagnosis OI Type II III . Because specific , defined clinical criterion consistently use make diagnosis , provide follow clinical guideline assist diagnosis . Any appropriate combination follow clinical finding acceptable . Diagnosis OI Type II Antenatal ultrasonography ( performed indication ) establish obstetric impression include short femur , small thoracic cage poorly mineralize bone . Analysis collagen synthesize cultured cell obtain chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) may establish diagnosis ; however , CVS perform specifically enrollment study . Clinical examination include prematurity , low birth weight , characteristic facies ( blue sclera , beak nose , extremely soft calvarium ) , `` frogleg '' hip , small thoracic cavity , fracture birth shortly thereafter , loose skin lax joint readily explain factor . Radiographic evaluation demonstrate various aspect characteristic picture telescope femur , bow tibia , bead rib , flatten vertebral body virtual absence calvarial mineralization . Diagnosis OI Type III Antenatal ultrasonography ( performed indication ) establish obstetric impression moderate form OI . Chorionic villus sample accept . Clinical examination include short stature , bony deformity , many fracture birth shortly thereafter . Blue scleras dental abnormality also common . Radiographic abnormality include thin , osteopenic bone limb evidence fracture , growth plate abnormality , undermineralized calvarium . Diagnosis diseases possibly similar presentation OI ( e.g . hypophosphatasia rickets ) exclude obtain serum calcium , phosphate alkaline phosphatase . These parameter expect within normal limit ( alkaline phosphatase may somewhat elevate ) patient OI . Age le 3 year time transplant . Parents legal guardian must sign informed consent indicate aware research study tell possible benefit toxic side effect , include treatment related mortality . Patients guardian give copy consent form . Identification suitable bone marrow donor . Any donor must sufficient size adequate bone marrow may harvest . HLA mismatch sibling unrelated donor . DNA type per form unrelated donor . Donors must 6/6 match 5/6 match ( serologic mismatch single Class I allele mismatch single DR1 allele ) . Patients ventilatory dependent due primary lung parenchymal disease prior BMT . Patients evidence basilar invagination/compression .</criteria>
