	<brief_summary>This study involve treatment boceprevir placebo combination PegIntron ( PEG ) + Ribavirin ( RBV ) ( weight-based dosing [ WBD ] ) previously untreated adult participant chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) genotype 1 . It hypothesize addition third active anti- Hepatitis C Virus ( anti-HCV ) drug may lead rapid viral response therapy two drug , therefore , addition boceprevir PegIntron plus ribavirin therapy 4-week lead-in period may allow increase rate sustain virologic response ( SVR ) shorter treatment duration ( population ) treatment PegIntron plus ribavirin alone . The study include two separate cohort , Cohort I ( White participant ) Cohort II ( Black participant ) . Participants cohort assign ( randomize ) one three study arm , 4-week lead-in period ( PEG + RBV ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants Cohort I Cohort II assign ( randomize ) one three study arm , 4-week lead-in period ( PEG + RBV ) . 1 . Control arm , participant treat ( PEG + RBV + placebo ) 44 week lead-in . 2 . Experimental arm Response Guided Therapy ( RGT ) In experimental arm , participant treat three drug ( PEG + RBV + boceprevir ) 24 week lead-in . At treatment week 28 , participant undetectable Hepatitis C Virus - ribonucleic acid ( HCV-RNA ) week 8 ( treatment week 24 ) , consider complete treatment , enter follow-up . Participants detectable HCV-RNA week 8 later receive additional 20 week therapy PegIntron Ribavirin ( PEG + RBV + placebo ) . 3 . Experimental arm , participant treat three drug ( PEG + RBV + Ribavirin ) 44 week lead-in . All participant follow 72 week follow randomization .</detailed_description>
