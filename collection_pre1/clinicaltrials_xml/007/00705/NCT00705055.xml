	<detailed_description>Summary Relevant Background Studies : Congenital anomaly play major role pediatric care . One leading cause infant mortality develop country sequelae congenital anomaly . In case exceeds death rate prematurity , SIDS , common cause infant neonatal death . The available tool assessment dysmorphic infant child base mainly experience examiner ability translate finding measurement physical examination qualitative quantitative summary accept value plot corresponding age ( 1,2 ) . Various unusual feature express qualitative term short stature , long finger , pear-shaped nose , small ear term , imply comparison body proportion subjective impression examiner . Following , impression patient 'gestalt ' form examiner 's mind . The database write material descriptive scarce graphic photograph , make comparison phenotypic expression describe subject one need diagnose difficult one . Even extensive exist data objective measurement available characterize phenotype , many physician involve diagnosis specific case base part diagnosis `` look like '' put impression context physical laboratory finding . Many syndrome human pathology recognize unique distinctive facial body characteristic . These stereotypic phenotypic characteristic mostly reproducible use anthropometric measurement . Charts available nor+mal data value various morphometric variable ( 1,2 ) . However , figure accurately measure 3D structure ( head , face ) . The following figure demonstrate measurement angle palpebral fissure : Fig . 1 : An upward obliquity palpebral fissure know mongoloid slant downward obliquity refer antimongoloid slant . In order obtain measurement within uterus 3D configuration appropriate image analysis necessary ( Figure Ref . 2 ) . Fetal alcohol syndrome ( FAS ) example syndrome underwent characterization graphic data analysis method ( 3 ) . The prevalence fetal alcohol syndrome ( FAS ) determine foster care population evaluate performance FAS Facial Photographic Screening Tool . The author conclude screen tool perform high accuracy could use track FAS prevalence time foster care population accurately assess effectiveness primary prevention . An expert recognize facial characteristic provide accurate analysis . Objective measurement could provide less experienced observer tool classify anatomical characteristic different disease syndrome . Facial phenotypic pattern extract large database facial surface . These biometric measurement use analysis evaluate respect `` normal '' value general population . 3- Methods Study : Following approval Helsinki Committee , project perform several successive step follow : A . Newborn scanning : A database 3D picture ( scan ) face newborn infant create . The scanning perform initially Carmel Medical Center , hospital stay . The examinee scan one time , order build database base data obtain scanned picture . The facial anthropometric pattern obtain 3D picture study off-line use computerized face pattern recognition system develop use Faculty Computer Sciences Technion . The measurement obtain compare geometric anthropometric data already use medical geneticist clinician ( 1-9 ) . B . Hardware software description : 3D Image Acquisition : Special hardware specially prepared department develop 3D image acquisition newborn ( see figure 2 ) . The hardware consist : structured light projector ( DLP Projector Casio 350j , digital video camera ( PTGray Flea CCD Camera ( Point Grey Research® Inc. ( Black white ( 640x480 ) , Aluminum projector cage , Special medical stand wheel , Personal Computer - Pentium 4 - XP , Flat screen 17 '' stand mount , Firewire cable , I/O cable . Systems used image acquisition : Currently two basic technology . One laser scan , narrow laser generate light plane scan face vertical direction 3-D structure face recover base form light contour intersection light plane face surface . The second method base so-called structured light technology ( regular light ) , one specially design light pattern project onto face , 3D structure recover base position measurement know pattern element projection face . Next , range image convert triangulated surface . The mesh possibly sub-sampled order decrease amount data . The choice number sub-samples tradeoff accuracy computational complexity . Using technique image acquisition reconstruction take 2-3 second . C. Morphometric parameter computation : In order compute common morphometric parameter like inner out cantal distance , interpupillary distance , etc. , need recognize various point interest 3D face . This do use various pattern recognition algorithm . At initial stage manual procedure use mark feature projection facial surface . Based result first phase automatic method develop detect feature use statistical algebraic algorithm . After relevant anchor point secure , simple 3D geometry use compute common morphometric data . Parameters include out canthal distance , interpupillary distance , palpebral fissure length , palpebral fissure angle , nasal-labial ( philtrum ) length , ear length , ear height , etc . The 3D data available used try search parameter might consider statistically meaningful indicator . Another avenue research examine importance metric distance estimation . One option check contribution geodesic distance indicator . Geodesic distance distance map compute surface ( Riemannian metric ) . A minimal geodesic path short path surface connect two point . An efficient method compute minimal geodesic distance triangulate domain develop Kimmel Sethian ( 10 ) . As face deformable surface important use representation facial surface measurement perform would invariant possible deformation ( i.e . various facial expression ) . In case bending invariant surface representation introduce Elad Kimmel use ( 11 ) . D. Statistical method use detect best independent significant morphometric variable significantly correlate various syndrome : Discriminating score construct use regression coefficient multivariate analysis test best cutoff point find , predict different genetic anomaly . Testing method result do use validation group patient healthy control , independent observer . The syndromatic examine newborn infant assess geneticist confirmation diagnosis make laboratory test appropriate . E. Statistical Power number patient : Many morphometrical variable assess , base 3D reconstruct method . Only apply multivariate analysis result , relative diagnostic importance variable reveal . Thus , single variable consider point , absolute discriminator normal abnormal value . However , consider example one 3D morphometric variable , degree palpebral fissure slanting , order discriminate `` Trisomy 21 '' `` normal '' Caucasian population , follow power analysis compute : The average SD value slant eye angle `` normal '' : 3.5 ( degree ) ± 1.5 . In Trisomy 21 patient , upward shift value . In order detect shift 2 SD 's ( i.e . 3 degree ) suppose SD large 3 degree pathological population need minimal number 21 patient control , order obtain statistical power 90 % . Total number patient : Our purpose obtain scan 800 newborn infant two year study period .</detailed_description>
