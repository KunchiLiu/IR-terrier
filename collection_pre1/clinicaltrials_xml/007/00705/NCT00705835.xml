	<brief_summary>The purpose research help u study vaccine treatment patient prostate cancer . A vaccine medicine teach body destroy harmful infection disease , cancer . Your immune system make many different type cell fight infection disease body . A vaccine may stimulate immune system destroy cancer cell . It may also help slow growth cancer . The vaccine solution give injection skin . It make several part . The first part PSMA , protein present many cancer , especially prostate cancer . It refer rsPSMA make laboratory study mixed material call AlhydrogelÂ® ( aluminum hydroxide suspension ) help immune system make cancer-fighting cell .</brief_summary>
