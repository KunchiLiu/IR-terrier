	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether weight loss achieve programme intensive lifestyle management result enhance production Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) together improvement release insulin glucagon thus improvement glycaemic control ( HbA1c ) , patient new onset type 2 diabetes . This cohort study comparison make assessment baseline , initial four month intensive intervention four month follow ( maintenance period ) . Each patient participate study 8 month . The entire study period 24 month . All patient new onset type 2 diabetes ( within 2 week diagnosis ) recruit referred Type 2 Diabetes Education Programme community ( `` FOCUS '' ) , per standard practice . The investigator also hope recruit direct local GP surgery advise study . At point , patient give study information sheet contact number wish participate study . Individuals unable give consent , would unable attend programme session medical reason , prescribe oral hypoglycaemic , antiobesity prescription medication may interfere study result whose BMI &lt; 25 , exclude . The investigator also exclude converse competently English special arrangement would need make people attend programme would impractical group set . Those willing participate invite individual appointment dietitian , study structure , aim procedure explain consent participate study obtain . For first session programme , participant ask attend follow overnight fast . Blood sample take basal measurement glucose , HbA1c , lipid , insulin , glucagon , GLP-1 , leptin , ghrelin adiponectin . They give standard 75 g glucose load sample repeat 30 min ( peak GLP-1 level ) . Baseline measurement weight , height , percent body fat , waistline circumference blood pressure also take session . Following assessment , patient participate first session education programme . The full assessment repeat 4 8 month interval . The weight management programme run Specialist Dietitian . It consist 2 phase : initial 4 month intensive weight loss phase , follow 4 month weight loss / maintenance phase . The initial four month programme consist 8 group education session least 3 phone call . The following 4 month programme consist 5 group session , least 3 phone call 1 individual appointment . Each education session last 60min . Before 1st session , 4 month 8 month session , blood take , . Before rest session , 15 minute devote weight assessment . The programme base portion control healthy eating support behavioural cognitive change intervention . Such intervention include self monitoring , stimulus control , goal setting , problem solve relapse prevention . The specialist `` Bournemouth HealthLink '' ( partnership back local NHS , Council University ) take part help participant increase activity level . The aim achieve weight loss 5 % first 4 month , minimum , weight maintenance possible reduction subsequent four month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Group Lifestyle Intervention People With New Onset Type 2 Diabetes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The early management type 2 diabetes usually consist education relate lifestyle change especially 80 90 % people type 2 diabetes obese . Obesity worsen metabolic physiological abnormality associate diabetes particularly hyperglycaemia ( raise blood sugar ) , hyperlipidaemia ( raise fat blood ) , hypertension prerequisite macrovascular complication . On hand , weight loss one cornerstones diabetes management improves glycaemic ( blood glucose ) control , lower triglyceride ( fat blood ) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( `` bad '' form cholesterol ) level improve blood pressure , mental health quality life . In 1993 investigator establish structured education programme patient new onset type 2 diabetes ; follow diagnosis make primary care individual see within one week nurse lead , open-access programme . Since 1994 , 2.5 fold increase number patient diagnose type 2 diabetes area . At diagnosis , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) rise 28.5 31.1kg/m2 associate fall HbA1c ( blood test give measure long term control diabetes ) level 10.3 % 8.1 % presentation . The low HbA1c diagnosis probably reflect early detection awareness condition . Since 2006 , responsibility provide education transfer primary care . More recently , secondary care base dietitian lead group weight management programme comprise intensive education session regular phone contact pilot unit . A recent evaluation service fifty one overweight obese individual complete 3-month programme . Average weight loss 3 month 4.8 kg equivalent 4.5 % baseline body weight . Follow six month , without intervention , show maintain ( weight loss 5.8 kg , equivalent 5.3 % , ns compare 3/12 ) . 43 % participant achieve &gt; 5 % weight reduction 6 % achieve &gt; 10 % . The intervention result significant reduction waistline circumference , body fat mass , total cholesterol , HbA1c , fast blood glucose , blood pressure . A number neuro-endocrine factor ( hormone influence activity brain nervous system ) role control insulin secretion regulation food intake . Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) incretin hormone , name base observation insulin response oral glucose load great follow intravenous administration equivalent amount glucose . Incretin hormone secrete small intestine response presence nutrient intestinal lumen . Physiologically , GLP-1 enhances glucose-mediated insulin secretion suppress glucagon ( hormone oppose action insulin ) secretion . GLP-1 also induce satiety improve gastric empty . In study patient establish diabetes , GLP-1 level response oral glucose show attenuated administration GLP-1 normalize fast post-prandial glucose level . It remain uncertain whether low GLP-1 level establish diabetes contribute pathogenesis condition consequence chronic hyperglycaemia , though observation GLP-1 level low obese subject suggest possibility former may case . Recently , investigator measure GLP-1 level patient newly diagnose type 2 diabetes assess effect initial period lifestyle dietary adjustment . In pilot project 9 newly diagnose patient ( time diagnosis 25 + 5 day , 4 female mean BMI 27.6 kg/m2 compare 9 age , gender body weight match control . All participant 75g oral glucose tolerance test measurement glucose , insulin , GLP-1 glucagon diabetic patient repeat OGTT 3 month . Compared control , diabetic patient higher glucagon level , low active GLP-1 baseline glucose load although AUC level significantly different . After 3 month lifestyle adjustment , 5 patient achieve weight loss ( 0.2 5 kg ) 4 gain weight ( 2.7 6.5 kg ) , give average weight change group 0.8 Kg . A small change HbA1c observe ( 7.31 % vs 6.96 % , p=0.25 ) . The level active GLP-1 augment diabetic group accompany increase insulin response 30 min . though glucagon level unaltered . It unclear whether intensive lifestyle change would result great improvement GLP-1 production thus great improvement diabetic control . If GLP-1 production enhance early follow diagnosis diabetes , may favorable consequence patient , GLP-1 show animal study vitro , role regulation beta glucose sense proliferation beta-cells . A number neuroendocrine peptide regulatory role energy homeostasis may influence insulin secretion glycaemic control . Leptin protein hormone produce adipose ( fat ) tissue key role regulate energy intake expenditure , suppressive effect appetite increase metabolism . Circulating leptin level reflect body fat mass . Leptin enter Central Nervous System ( CNS ) interact centre regulation appetite metabolism . Despite suppressive effect , elevate level often note obesity , possibly suggest resistance hormone , though may result stimulation increase insulin level , would expect obesity . Leptin turn inhibit insulin release fall leptin result weight loss may enhance insulin production may therefore beneficial patient diabetes . Unlike leptin , ghrelin orixigenic ( stimulate appetite ) hormone act via Growth Hormone secretagogue receptor . It hormone known stimulate increase feed weight gain . Basal plasma level increase malnutrition decrease obesity . In , study , insulin show inhibitor ghrelin release . An anticipated rise ghrelin weight reduction might offset effect lifestyle intervention stimulation appetite increase intake . Adiponectin adipocyte ( fat cell ) hormone modulate number metabolic process , include glucose regulation fatty acid catabolism , may role metabolic derangement type 2 diabetes . Though produce adipose ( fat ) tissue , plasma adiponectin level decrease obesity consequence regulation . Adiponectin insulin sensitize effect central effect energy homeostasis , promote weight reduction . Levels adiponectin find reduce type 2 diabetes compare non-diabetic control . Weight reduction increase circulating level . Again little known effect change adiponectin early stage type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
