	<brief_summary>Background : - The T-Cell Project , sponsor International T-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group , consortium institution interested achieve detailed information clinical biological characteristic T-cell lymphoma . - The T-Cell Project serve repository data patient peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) worldwide . Its overall goal improve T-cell subtype classification evaluate treatment strategy subtype . Objectives : -To implement standardize epidemiologic questionnaire ongoing T-Cell Project allow evaluation various potential risk factor PTLCs . Eligibility : -Untreated patient 18 year age old diagnose PTLC September 1 , 2006 , later . Design : -Patients complete questionnaire contain follow information : Demographic information Smoking history alcohol use Personal history cancer History cancer among first-degree relative Medical history History transplant History blood transfusion Medication use Occupational residential history Pesticide treatment -The information collect link clinical pathologic information T-Cell Project database .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCLs ) comprise heterogeneous group neoplasm derive post-thymic lymphoid cell different stage differentiation different morphological pattern , phenotype , clinical presentation . Although number case-control study non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) identify various risk factor disease , include autoimmune condition , family history hematopoietic malignancy , smoking , hepatitis C infection , host susceptibility , risk factor largely pertain B-cell lymphoma subtypes comprise well 90 percent NHLs . At present , know epidemiologic risk factor PTCL subtypes . This largely due lack sample size PTCL one epidemiologic study . The aim proposal implement standardize epidemiologic risk factor questionnaire on-going T-Cell Project . Briefly , T-Cell Project international consortium on-going clinical trial peripheral PTCL . It serve prospective collection patient ( great 18 year ) worldwide PTCL enrol participate medical institution treatment clinical trial . The overall goal T-Cell Project improve current T-cell subtype classification evaluate different treatment strategy T-cell subtype . The specific goal proposal implement , within T-Cell Project , 20-minute standardized epidemiologic questionnaire allow evaluation various potential risk factor T-cell lymphoma . Importantly , currently know epidemiologic risk factor PTCL . We plan administer questionnaire 800 PTCL patient ; successful collection would large database PTCLs date epidemiologic data . If questionnaire implementation assess epidemiological risk factor PTCL among patient T-Cell Project find logistically feasible , descriptive analytic epidemiologic analysis collect data understand etiology PTCL would pursue NCI collaboration member T-Cell Project . For analysis , NCI would receive fully anonymized de-linked data identifier .</detailed_description>
