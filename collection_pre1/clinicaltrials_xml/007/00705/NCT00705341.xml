	<brief_summary>The purpose research evaluate methacholine challenge test accurate indicator asthma patient receive treatment asthma . Phase 1 study compare methacholine challenge test result asthma patient people asthma . In phase 2 , test result people asthma low dose inhale corticosteroid compare result high dose inhaled corticosteroid . Both male female stable asthma ( asthma participant ) without asthma ( control ) enrol . Participants 12 69 year age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist two phase . The first phase cross-sectional , case-control study measure sensitivity specificity methacholine challenge test differentiate asthmatic participant non-asthmatic control . The second phase cross-over , randomize , double-masked trial design evaluate impact high dose versus low dose inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) bronchial hyperreactivity ( BHR ) asthmatic .</detailed_description>
