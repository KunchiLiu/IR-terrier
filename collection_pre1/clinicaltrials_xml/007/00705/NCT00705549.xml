	<brief_summary>This prospective pilot phase II trial , patient wet stage IIIb IV NSCLC use chemotherapy regimen define accord pharmacogenomic profile ( tumoral expression ERCC1 , BRCA1 RRM1 ) tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advanced stage NSCLC essentially fatal disease treatment mainly palliative . Systemic cisplatin-based chemotherapy remain mainstream treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) since improves survival , symptom control quality life compare best supportive care . The selection appropriate treatment individual patient remain challenge clinical oncology , particularly advanced disease . Several line evidence indicate polymorphism , gene transcript gene mutation play predictive role use tailor chemotherapy different subgroup cancer patient . There evidence lead u use expression level ERCC1 tumor molecular marker customize chemotherapy . Another gene , BRCA1 crucial role DNA repair , since implicate transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair ( TC-NER ) , lead radio- chemo-resistance . RRM1 , localize 11p15.5 , also act putative tumor suppressor gene . RRM1 overexpression relate gemcitabine resistance human oropharyngeal epidermoid carcinoma KB cell well patient NSCLC . For reason decide conduct prospective pilot phase II trial , patient wet stage IIIb IV NSCLC use chemotherapy regimen define accord pharmacogenomic profile ( tumoral expression ERCC1 , BRCA1 RRM1 ) tumor cell .</detailed_description>
