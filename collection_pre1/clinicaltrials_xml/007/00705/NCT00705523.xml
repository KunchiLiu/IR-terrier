	<brief_title>Varenicline ( Chantix™ ) Treatment Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By provide low level reinforcement down-grading `` high '' associate concurrent administration abuse drug , combine agonist/antagonist therapy promote initial sustain abstinence . Based varenicline 's specific affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptor implicate alcohol reward circuitry , appear good candidate treatment alcohol dependence . Alcohol exert reinforce dopamine-enhancing effect activation nicotinic receptor . In addition partial agonist activity heteromeric α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor , varenicline also show full agonist homomeric α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor . That full agonism α7 may key reduce alcohol withdrawal crave early alcohol abstinence , thus reduce relapse , α7 receptor implicate neural reward circuitry activate alcohol use .</detailed_description>
