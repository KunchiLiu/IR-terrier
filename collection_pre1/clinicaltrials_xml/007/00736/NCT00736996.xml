	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate novel treatment delay progression dementia patient mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) metabolic syndrome ( MS ) . The hypothesis treatment pioglitazone endurance exercise training improve , stabilize , attenuate decline cognitive function compare control . This study also discover potential mechanism improvement determine baseline prevalence amnestic versus non-amnestic MCI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Or Exercise Treat Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Metabolic Syndrome ( MS ) rapidly grow public health problem . This constellation metabolic abnormality increase risk diabetes , heart disease death . Recently evidence link MS cognitive impairment dementia , include Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . AD precede state call Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) , characterize subjective objective memory impairment , functional impairment . Although person MCI develop AD , conversion rate MCI AD 15 % per year , 5-10 time cognitively normal individual . There great interest finding treatment prevent AD intervene early stage , i.e . MCI . The mechanism ( ) link MS cognitive impairment clear , although evidence insulin resistance inflammation play key role . Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) medication approve treatment Type 2 Diabetes , work reduce insulin resistance . In addition , drug anti-inflammatory property . A recent pilot study show improvement area cognition patient MCI mild AD treat TZD rosiglitazone . Endurance exercise training ( EET ) establish treatment MS insulin resistance . There also evidence EET may improve cognitive function well . Adults age 55 year old MS MCI baseline randomize 6-month intervention either ( 1 ) treatment pioglitazone , ( 2 ) endurance exercise training , ( 3 ) control ( placebo exercise ) . The hypothesis treatment TZD pioglitazone EET improve cognitive function compare control , evidence either improvement , stabilization , less decline performance cognitive testing . Participants undergo physical exam include blood urine test , complete neurologic exam , comprehensive battery cognitive test . They also DEXA scan , exercise treadmill test , non-invasive test vascular function hyperglycemic-euglycemic clamp procedure measure insulin resistance .</detailed_description>
