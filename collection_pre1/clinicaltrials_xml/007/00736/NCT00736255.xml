The investigator hypothesize initially smoker ADHD optimize dose LDX prior quit smoke remain dose medication quit remain abstinent long patient treat placebo quitting.However due recent key issue arisen show initiation stimulant treatment subject actively smoke may facilitate increase smoking , give study still early stage study execution , investigator revise study design use empirically validate pretreatment approach NRT initiate LDX treatment first post quit date order reduce withdrawal symptom accompany smoke cessation .
