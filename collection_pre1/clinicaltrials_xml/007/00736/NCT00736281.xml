	<brief_summary>The question propose study safety efficacy . 1 . Concerning safety : `` Are sublingual food drop ( SLIT ) safe enough use stimulation natural immune suppression patient food allergy ? '' 2 . Concerning efficacy : `` Do drop suppress food allergy enough patient eat previously allergic food little allergic reaction ? '' The aim trial provide systematic collection data prove safety efficacy food drop correction food allergy . A patient 's range symptom , include limited fatigue , nausea , vomit , diarrhea , abdominal pain , insomnia diagnostic indicator food allergy . An approach answer question do randomize , control , blind study . The design study could reasonable powerful layout limit bias account placebo effect : The patient enrol study present food allergy symptom diagnostic test provide specific information regard food allergy . Once diagnosis make consent treatment obtain , participant randomly assign either group receive food allergy intervention SLIT ( food allergen mix 50 % glycerin vial ) group receive control SLIT ( glycerin ) . The patient truly blind treatment SLIT food allergy vial identical contain distinguishing feature could reveal content . There also difference taste vial contain glycerin food allergens vial contain glycerin . Therefore , food allergy SLIT randomized-controlled study reasonably achieve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : Randomized-controlled blind trial evaluate safety efficacy sublingual immunotherapy food allergy sufferer . The study report adverse event cause administration food allergy drop . Food allergy manifest many form include general fatigue , abdominal pain , GERD , nausea , symptom . End Points : Comparison group 1 2 patient-reported adverse , well beneficial , event food allergy immunotherapy 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month maintenance dose achieve ( SLIT questionnaire ) . These comparison relate safety efficacy issue . Methodology : Trial subject identify present complaint due ingestion certain symptomatic food . Clinical assessment potential food allergy participant SLIT occur accord usual testing standard . All participant diagnostic test ( usually RAST analysis food challenge technique ) confirm specific food allergy . Subjects meet inclusion criterion ask participate study inform consent . Once consent obtain , subject randomly assign either control intervention group . Group 1 ( control group ) receive sublingual immunotherapy ( escalation follow maintenance ) vial contain glycerin . Group 2 ( intervention group ) receive sublingual immunotherapy ( escalation follow maintenance ) vial contain glycerin previously diagnose food allergen . After offend food diagnose , subject instruct avoid food 9-week escalation dos maintenance immunotherapy dose six month . After eight-month combined period escalation maintenance , participant allow reintroduce know offend food . In addition , participant ask respond questionnaire pre-defined interval regard adverse symptom may experience maintenance SLIT . These questionnaire allow u determine food drop contribute adverse event , well effective drop suppress immune response previously allergic food . Procedures : At initial clinic visit , potential subject ask elaborate specific food allergy symptom order obtain good understand food allergy involve . Also , diagnostic test perform base sign symptom include : 1 . Clinical History 2 . Radioallergosorbent Test ( RAST ) 3 . Oral Food Challenge Participants intervention group receive SLIT glycerin individualize food allergen . Subjects control group receive SLIT glycerin . The expected length individual 's participation sixteen eighteen month . This period include time initial clinic visit diagnostic work-up , achievement SLIT maintenance dose , 3,6,9,12 month post-maintenance dose safety questionnaire . Stopping rule apply intervention placebo group case adverse event .</detailed_description>
