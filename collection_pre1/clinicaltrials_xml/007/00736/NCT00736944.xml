	<brief_title>Trial 2 Cycles Induction Chemo With Abraxane , Cetuximab , Cisplatin , &amp; 5-FU Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To determine clinical CR rate ( CR-p ) primary tumor site IC regimen weekly Abraxane cetuximab CF ( ACCF ) give two cycle ( 6 week ) patient locally advance non-metastatic HNSCC . The assessment primary tumor site response perform treat physician careful clinical examination use WHO criterion . Radiographic study also perform assess primary tumor site response use primarily confirm lack disease progression may detect base clinical examination alone . The secondary objective include : - Document clinical PR rate ( PR-p ) primary tumor site IC regimen - Document clinical CR PR rate involve regional node ( CR-n PR-n ) IC regimen - Document clinical overall CR rate ( CR-o ) ( define achievement CR primary tumor site involve regional node ) clinical overall PR rate ( PR-o ) IC regimen - Document CR ( CR-p , CR-n , CR-o ) PR ( PR-p , PR-n , PR-o ) rate FDG uptake PET scan IC regimen - Document radiographic CR ( CR-p , CR-n , CR-o ) PR ( PR-p , PR-n , PR-o ) rate assess conventional CT scan use RECIST criterion IC regimen . - Correlate primary tumor site , nodal overall tumor response rate base WHO criteria assessment base CT scan FDG-PET/CT . - Document quantify SPARC expression IHC primary tumor tissue obtain baseline patient attempt correlate result primary tumor site response ACCF . - Document grade AE 's IC regimen pre-planned safety analysis first ten patient complete IC regimen . - Determine overall survival ( OS ) , disease-free survival ( DFS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient population .</detailed_description>
