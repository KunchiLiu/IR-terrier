	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) clinical syndrome rapid onset non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema manifest clinically hypoxemia ( PaO2/FiO2≤300 mmHg ) bilateral pulmonary infiltrates . When hypoxemia severe ( PaO2/FiO2≤200 mmHg ) term acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . It represent significant public health issue . Patients ALI ARDS require admission critical care unit advance life support utilize considerable health care resource . An immense plethora translational knowledge acquire since first description ARDS 1967 . However , estimate incidence ARDS ALI vary widely , true magnitude health problem still remain unclear . Current estimate incidence ALI/ARDS range 15 80 case per 100.000 population , almost 40.000 case per year Spain . Combined mortality rate ALI/ARDS range 30-45 % . ALI ARDS occur complication primary cause critical illness patient , usually severe infection trauma . Published epidemiological study ALI ARDS last 20 year difficult compare . Some report use different definition ALI ARDS others evaluate incidence short period time ( day several week ) extrapolate data estimate one-year incidence . Very study collect information entire year , none evaluate degree hypoxemia standard ventilatory setting , propose recently HELP Network ( Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2007 ; 176:795-804 ) . As result , propose perform one-year prospective audit ALI ARDS patient manage 40 ICUs 17 Spanish province ( 15 province mainland 2 province Canary Islands ) . We intend collect data patient admit develop ALI/ARDS aim understand epidemiology natural history acute lung injury . These province scatter Spain representative demographic difference across country .</detailed_description>
