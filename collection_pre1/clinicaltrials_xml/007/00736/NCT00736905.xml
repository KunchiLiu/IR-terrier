	<brief_title>TMC278-TiDP6-C130 : Pharmacokinetics , Safety Tolerability TMC278 Subjects With Mildly Moderately Impaired Hepatic Function .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected patient routinely treat combination 3 4 drug ( highly active antiretroviral therapy [ HAART ] ) , reduce risk viral resistance development . Development new potent antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug urgently need prolong suppression viral replication subject infect HIV . This Phase I , open-label , parallel , control , sequential study investigate single-dose steady-state pharmacokinetics , short-term safety tolerability TMC278 subject mild moderate hepatic impairment compare subject normal hepatic function . The trial aim provide guidance administration dose recommendation TMC278 subject mildly moderately impaired hepatic function . The study population consist total 32 male female subject 18 65 year . Panel A consist 8 subject mild hepatic impairment 8 healthy subject match sex , age ( ± 5 yr ) , BMI ( ± 15 % ) . Panel B consist 8 subject moderate hepatic impairment 8 healthy subject match sex , age ( ± 5 yr ) , BMI ( ± 15 % ) . Treatment Panel A Panel B conduct sequentially . Subjects Panel A receive TMC278 25 mg tablet daily total 11 day . Recruitment subject Panel B start evaluation safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic data subject Panel A . The anticipated dose TMC278 administer subject Panel B dose Panel A ( 25 mg daily 11 day ) , dose might adjust depend result Panel A .</detailed_description>
