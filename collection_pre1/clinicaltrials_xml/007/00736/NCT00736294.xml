	<brief_summary>Atrial Flutter [ AFL ] relatively frequent arrhythmia , consider benign , associate invalidating symptom thromboembolic risk . The objective treatment consist one hand sinus rhythm [ SR ] restoration hand prevention long-term recurrence . In clinical setting , AFL radiofrequency ablation [ RFA ] become first line therapy due high effectiveness safety . The effectiveness AFL RFA attenuate subsequent risk atrial fibrillation [ AFib ] close 25 % 1 year . This risk subsequent AFib related common substrate arrhythmia . When AFib occur , interest maintain SR still require , even recent study show significant difference term total mortality rate rhythm control strategies [ AFFIRM , RACE PIAF study ] . The study publish underlined anti-arrhythmic drug limit patient arrhythmias [ AFib AFL ] . After year center mechanism electric treatment AFib , researcher nowadays focus study 's evaluation atrial tissue substrate . Accordingly , renin-angiotensin system role investigate many work . Indeed , angiotensin II play role modification atrial pressure fiber stretch [ `` stretch '' ] , condition require development AFib . Angiotensin II also factor implied tissue fibrosis lead tissue proliferation collagen alteration . These mechanism lead atria cell conduction disorder refractory period modification . Moreover , enzyme conversion expression angiotensin II receptor deterioration observed patient AFib . This bring concept AFib treatment interfere tissue remodel way renin-angiotensin system . Drugs angiotensin convert enzyme inhibition [ ACEI ] may reduce AFib patient heart failure . No randomized study far compare ACEI drug placebo among high-risk patient AFib post AFL RFA area . On basis experimental clinical study , investigator seek evaluate ACEI use prevention AFib AFL post RFA ablation .</brief_summary>
