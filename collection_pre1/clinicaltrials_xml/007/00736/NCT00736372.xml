	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis advance metastatic cancer lymphoma whose tumor refractory standard therapy standard therapy available increase survival least three month . 2 . Men woman least 18 year age . 3 . A predicted life expectancy least 12 week . 4 . ECOG performance status 02 . 5 . Patients must discontinue previous anticancer therapy and/or investigational agent least three week prior treatment PX12 ( six week mitomycin C nitrosureas ) recover ( grade 1 less ) toxic effect treatment . In case oral agent short half life , case case basis , minimum two week interval may permit . 6 . Patients must discontinue radiation therapy least four week prior treatment PX12 recover radiationrelated toxicity . Palliative radiation 10 fraction less permit four week interval necessary ( also allow therapy ) . 7 . The patient adequate hematologic function define follow : platelet &gt; 100,000/μL ; hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL ( may transfuse level ) ; ANC &gt; 1,500 cells/μL . 8 . The patient adequate hepatic function define follow : bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL ; aspartate aminotransaminase ( AST/SGOT ) &amp; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT/SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 time ( five ULN patient liver metastasis ) institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) . International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) within 1.5 time ULN unless subject coumadin . 9 . The patient adequate renal function define serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 x ULN . 10 . Patient sign informed consent . 11 . Patient compliant study geographic proximity allow adequate followup . 12 . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Childbearing potential defined woman menses within past 12 month , tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician 1 . Patients symptomatic pulmonary disease , e.g. , active chronic obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease , asthma , evidence interstitial pneumonitis , pulmonary fibrosis , etc . 2 . Patients history dyspnea , dyspnea exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea . 3 . Patients meet Medicare criterion receive home oxygen oxygen . 4 . Patients history prior lung radiation . 5 . Patients active infection require i.v . antibiotic study entry . 6 . Any serious concomitant systemic disorder opinion investigator would place patient excessive unacceptable risk toxicity . 7 . Significant central nervous system psychiatric disorder ( ) preclude ability patient provide inform consent . 8 . Known suspected brain metastasis receive adequate therapy . In case previously treat brain metastasis , minimum four week interval completion radiation therapy registration study radiologic evidence stable respond brain metastasis require . In set previous CNS metastasectomy , adequate ( minimum four week ) recovery surgery and/or radiation therapy document . 9 . Major surgery within four week treatment PX12 . 10 . Patients history seizure . 11 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 12 . Patients breastfeed pregnant ( confirm serum βHCG within 10 day prior start study treatment applicable ) . 13 . Any condition could jeopardize safety patient compliance protocol .</criteria>
