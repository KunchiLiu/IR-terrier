	<brief_summary>Summary : Background : There lot interest function role HDL prevent mitigate atherosclerosis patient near LDLc target . Statins variable effect HDLc accentuate patient low baseline HDLc . Higher dose statin use commonly practice base new outcomes study find great benefit higher dos compare low standard dos . This study test FDA approve dosage two commonly use statin medication . Design : The study design examine effect 80mg simvastatin 80mg atorvastatin HDLc concentration . Serum save hopeful collaborative effort investigator U. Washington able advance test HDL particle functionality . Based first 13 patient study Indiana University , effect statins HDLc concentration vary greatly . It unknown impact concentration change functionality particles however . A meta-analysis 4 prospective trial publish JAMA 2006 find increase HDLc statin independently associate regression atherosclerosis measure intravascular ultrasound . Patients : Patients low HDLc primary population recruit . Exclusion criterion include interact medication , pregnancy , baseline hepatic disease illness would put patient increase risk statin side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The subject ask come study visit fast state ( water past 12 hour ) . Both blood pressure pulse check screen visit well study visit . The baseline ( screen ) visit include consent process completion first section Data Collection Sheet screen appropriate inclusion exclusion criterion . Subjects statin need 8-week wash period prior begin trial . The subject primary provider must agree washout . At screen visit subject take statin drug , 13 ml blood drawn . The blood process OCTRI Core Laboratory staff . All lipid parameter ( complete lipid profile , apoB , apoA1 , hs-CRP ) test OHSU lipid core lab . Some blood collect sent OHSU core lab test ALT well obtain long-term storage sample . Blood sample frozen store 14th floor CHH building laboratory Oregon State University School Pharmacy . Samples batch processing ( see sample process ) . The lipid profile ALT screen visit process within approximately one week . If necessary laboratory parameter meet inclusion exclusion criterion , subject schedule first study visit . Encapsulated placebo give subject take screening first study visit . At screen visit subject take statin drug , study describe consent enroll obtain bloodwork perform . Subjects give encapsulate placebo take 8 week washout period . At second screen visit , blood drawn ascertain baseline laboratory value describe subject statin drug . The subject schedule first study visit 2 week later . The laboratory parameter ( hs-CRP , apoA1 apoB ) future bloodwork necessary ongoing conduct trial may batch process periodically . The ALT second study visit ( first course study medication ) process prior third study visit confirm ALT remain less 3 time ULR . If ALT elevate ( &gt; 105 IU/L ) second study visit , subject discontinue study subject primary physician notify . Additionally , subject complains myopathy felt consistent possible drug-induced myositis , creatine phospho-kinase ( CPK ) test order . Consistent product package insert ( PI ) atorvastatin simvastatin , therapy stop subject discontinue study CPK great 10X ULR . At first study visit , subject randomize OHSU Research Pharmacy receive either 6 week 80mg atorvastatin 6 week 80mg simvastatin . The subject schedule follow-up 6 week trial entry date ask bring investigational drug vial back next visit . The subject also give diary record daily dose medication take . A urine pregnancy test do first third study visit woman post-menopausal define least 6 month without menstruation age 50 . Women meet post-menopausal criterion , sexually active form birth control counsel begin remain birth control duration trial . Inability unwillingness comply choose birth control measure result exclusion trial . Women child bear potential birth control time screen visit willing begin birth control schedule first study visit sooner 6 week screen visit allow time implementation choose birth control . Subjects hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) allow enroll provide regimen stable expect change study period . Subjects informed regimen change study , need remove study . At second visit , appropriate section Data Collection Sheet complete , pill count remain drug dose do 13 ml blood drawn process previously outline . The subject schedule follow-up 6 week leave without study medicine . At third visit , appropriate section Data Collection Sheet complete 13 ml blood drawn process previously outline . The subject give 6 week supply second medication ( previously determine first randomization scheme ) schedule follow-up 6 week . At fourth final visit , appropriate section data collection sheet complete 13 ml blood drawn process previously outline . In study visit , study staff contact subject phone remind next appointment ask adverse effect problem subject may experience . In event phone number record become inactive , letter send address record .</detailed_description>
