	<brief_summary>The question propose study one treatment : `` To extent simultaneous BMT ( Bilateral Myringotomy Tympanostomy Tubes ) , adenoidectomy , diagnosis/avoidance food allergy affect frequency recurrent otitis medium ( ROM ) versus standard academy approach ( tube insertion ) chronic otitis medium effusion ; furthermore , adenoid factor OME food allergy diagnosis treatment able significantly prevent ROM tube fall ? '' The trial seek provide evidence treatment Chronic OME child involve surgical procedure ( BMT +/- adenoidectomy ) , well , food allergy work-up subsequent avoidance offend food order significantly decrease ROM . To answer question , prospective , randomize control trial need conduct . Since majority OME patient pediatric population , parental consent must obtain . Subjects study initially present clinic otitis medium symptom diagnostic test tympanogram , otoscopy , history recurrent otitis medium obtain . Once surgical decision bilateral myringotomy tympanostomy tube make , parent inform trial . The standard protocol child present initial Chronic OME perform BMT . Therefore , data control group ( Group 1 ) obtain faculty ENT follow academy 's recommendation . Data Group 2 3 collect ENT faculty member , include faculty co-investigator perform BMT obtain food allergy blood draw time surgery . The study 's faculty co-investigator describe food avoidance technique post-op patient Groups 2 3 . Patients previous adenotonsillar surgery placement tympanostomy tube enrol study . The incidence ROM episodes trial group record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Food Allergy - Tubes - Adenoids ( FATA ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : Randomized control trial evaluate efficacy new approach treatment child present chronic otitis medium effusion . The new approach call surgical correction OME BMT ( Bilateral Myringotomy Tympanostomy Tubes ) +/- Adenoidectomy , additional food allergy diagnosis subsequent management offend food order reduce frequency recurrent otitis medium ( ROM ) . End Points : Comparison group ( 1,2,3 ) recurrence otitis medium follow surgery . All trial participant follow-up clinic appointment every three month tube fall point , patient present clinic every three month one year evaluation recurrent middle ear fluid . Questionnaires administer Groups 2 &amp; 3 F/U appointment evaluate food allergy management . Methodology : Trial participant identify otitis medium sign symptom . Subjects meet inclusion criterion ask participate study consent obtain . Surgery perform base group assignment . All trial subject receive standard post-op care also see clinical evaluation q 3 month post-surgery , q 3 month tube one year . The number otitis medium episode follow year child assign group 1,2 , 3 record . Procedures : At initial clinic visit , potential trial subject ask otitis medium history , include many episode OM past six month , evidence hearing loss , lack response antibiotic therapy , prolong period OME , previous tympanograms . Pediatric patient tympanic membrane ( TM ) evaluate otoscopy evidence OME . Tympanometry also perform confirm presence fluid middle ear . Participants control group ( Group 1 ) receive standard academy regimen initial presentation Chronic OME , insertion BMT . Group 2 trial subject receive food allergy test management conjunction BMT . Group 3 involve BMT insertion , adenoidectomy , food allergy test management . Food management involve parental education avoid specific offend food allergic child . The total length subject participation variable depend tubes come . Once tubes fall , patient evaluate every three month one full year .</detailed_description>
