	<brief_summary>Staphylococcus aureus common bacteria responsible skin , bone , muscle infection . Recent study United States suggest type bacterium call methicillin resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) become dramatically common , especially community strain . However , Canadian data still largely lack . This study aim determine prevalence community acquire ( CA ) MRSA among patient present skin soft tissue infection Urgent Care Center Emergency Departments London , Ontario . This determine take swabs enrollment patient 's nose , throat , sit infection . Patients ask complete health questionnaire goal identify risk factor associate CA-MRSA . Through follow-up swabs participant ' nose throats one three month , effect treatment patient 's carry MRSA determine . Results may use form guideline empirical S aureus treatment region , reduce possible morbidity mortality delay suboptimal treatment CA-MRSA infection . Improved understanding risk factor associate MRSA infection Canadian setting , may also change practice physician consider empiric antibiotic therapy skin soft tissue infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>What Prevalence Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Skin Soft Tissue Infections Presenting Emergency Departments Canadian Academic Health Care Center ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective &amp; Hypothesis : The objective prospective study determine prevalence MRSA community acquire MRSA ( CA-MRSA ) adult patient ( &gt; 17yrs old ) present skin soft tissue infection emergency department ( EDs ) academic health care set London , Ontario . Secondary objective include identification demographic clinical variable associate MRSA , characterization MRSA antimicrobial susceptibility genotype , determine effect treatment MRSA colonization . We believe prevalence MRSA CA-MRSA London , Ontario low rate recently publish academic hospital United States . The hypothesis study patient present Emergency Departments London , Ontario skin soft tissue infection 10 % prevalence CA-MRSA , certainly prevalence may much high . Purpose : Results research may use part guideline empirical S aureus treatment region , thus reduce possible morbidity mortality delay suboptimal treatment CA-MRSA infection . This information , along improve understanding risk factor associate MRSA infection Canadian setting , potential change practice physician consider empiric antibiotic therapy skin soft tissue infection . This study focus epidemiology patient skin soft tissue infection present adult emergency department ( EDs ) London Health Sciences Centre ( LHSC ) Urgent Care Center St. Joseph 's Health Centre ( SJHC ) . By use comparison group non CA-MRSA infection , proportion CA-MRSA relation total MRSA methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( MSSA ) region investigate . The study also investigate risk factor CA-MRSA population include : demographic , housing history , contact health care system , past CA-MRSA infection , asymptomatic CA-MRSA colonization , colonization/infection close contact , involvement contact sports/team sport , hygienic body shaving , chronic skin disorder , recurrent/recent antibiotic use , IV drug use , contact incarcerated individual , chronic disease . Through follow-up visit one three month involve naris throat swabs patient initially test positive MRSA effect treatment MRSA colonization determine . Furthermore , follow-up questionnaire administer patient one month determine complication rate patient colonized MRSA versus colonize . The current recommendation antibiotic treatment unknown S. aureus infection base clinical judgment , therefore understanding regional incidence susceptibility CA-MRSA essential empiric treatment . Through microbiological analysis case , laboratory parameter antibiotic susceptibility CA-MRSA presenting LHSC establish . As well , clinical characteristic patient document aid clinician recognize patient present CA-MRSA . Experimental Design : This study prospective prevalence study involve adult patient ( &gt; 17years old ) skin soft-tissue infection present Emergency Departments LHSC ( University Hospital Victoria Hospital ) well Urgent Care SJHC . These department combine approximate total 150,000 visit per year . The study expect enrollment 152 patient July 2008- July 2009 . The study continue three month last patient enrol follow-up nasal throat swab may obtain , applicable . n = Z2 P ( 1-P ) / d2 n = 1.962 * .10 ( 1- .10 ) / 0.052 n = 3.8416 * .10 * .90 / .0025 n = 138 While investigator anticipate problem non-response miss value , take consideration , over-sample sample size 10 % . Therefore , recruit least 152 patient study . Therefore , assume 80 % power , estimate prevalence 10 % , precision level 5 % , 152 patient need 95 % confident true proportion MRSA adult patient ( &gt; 17yrs old ) present skin soft tissue infection 5 % 15 % . Written , inform consent obtain patient meet study inclusion criterion .</detailed_description>
