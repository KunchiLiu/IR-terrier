	<brief_title>RISE : A Clinical Evaluation StarClose™ Vascular Closure System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate StarClose™ VCS femoral artery subject ambulate early post-percutaneous cardiac peripheral vascular , diagnostic catheterization procedure . The clinical use vascular closure device rapid hemostasis femoral access first report 1991 . 18 participant may ambulate almost immediately diagnostic coronary angiography discharge many hour earlier currently practice center utilize supine restriction period 6 hour diagnostic catheterization.14 After coronary intervention , participant comfort additionally increase immediate sheath removal . This early ambulation study evaluation clip-based technology , achieve vascular hemostasis use novel extravascular Nitinol clip provide immediate mechanical closure depend upon body 's clotting system . The procedure perform participant meet specific entrance criterion .</detailed_description>
