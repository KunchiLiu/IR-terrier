	<brief_summary>The purpose study obtain database brain function sample non-smokers task MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) machine . Our hypothesis among nonsmoker , reactivity smoke cue highly similar control cue may vary function attitude toward smoke and/or family history smoking . We also hypothesize brain activity n-back task similar data collect task smoker abstinent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thirty six non-smokers undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scanning . During scan participant complete n-back task-a measure work memory-and cue-reactivity task-a measure responses smoke cue . Before scan , participant complete training session familiarize task . All participant pass screen visit order include study .</detailed_description>
