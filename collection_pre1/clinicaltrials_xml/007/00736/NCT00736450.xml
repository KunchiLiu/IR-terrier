	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Oblimersen sodium may help chemotherapy work well make cancer cell sensitive drug . Giving oblimersen sodium together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study side effect give oblimersen sodium together combination chemotherapy see well work treat patient newly diagnose stage I , stage II , stage III , stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oblimersen Sodium Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage I , Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility determine rate rapid turn around , within 7 work day receipt adequate tissue UNMC AFFYmetrix microarray study newly diagnose patient Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) receive treatment protocol . II . To evaluate efficacy ( complete response rate ) Genasense ( antisense bcl-2 ) give addition standard cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin , prednisone -rituximab ( CHOP-R ) newly diagnose patient DLBCL find ABC type gene expression profile IHC compare newly diagnose patient DLBCL express ABC type go receive standard CHOP-R ( control ) . III . To evaluate toxicity Genasense ( antisense bcl-2 ) give addition standard cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin , prednisone -rituximab ( CHOP-R ) newly diagnose patient DLBCL find ABC type gene expression profile . OUTLINE : Patients diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) express ABC type proceed treatment group I . Patients DLBCL express ABC type proceed treatment group II . GROUP I ( oblimersen sodium standard CHOP-R ) : Patients receive oblimersen sodium IV continuously day 1-7 . Patients also receive CHOP-R comprise rituximab IV , cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , vincristine sulfate IV day 5 prednisone orally day 5-10 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP II ( standard CHOP-R alone ) : Patients receive CHOP-R comprise rituximab IV , cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , vincristine sulfate IV day 1 prednisone orally day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
