	<brief_summary>Pachyonychia congenita ( PC ) rare , autosomal dominant keratin disorder affect nail , skin , oral mucosa , larynx , hair teeth . Pathogenic mutation keratin K6a , K6b , K16 K17 act via dominant negative mechanism , lead manifestation disease . The disabling PC symptom painful plantar blister keratoderma require use ambulation device 50 percent patient . Despite understanding molecular basis PC , current treatment limit mechanical removal thick callus , non-specific topical keratolytics , oral retinoids , none alleviates blister plantar pain satisfactorily . A public charity , PC Project , found support development treatment PC ( www.pachyonychia.org ) . In collaboration charity , small company , TransDerm , Inc. , develop small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) specifically target mutation one PC keratins , K6a . As siRNA target single nucleotide mutation , effective PC subject harbor specific mutation . There currently six know patient carry mutation International Pachyonychia Congenita Research Registry , three patient live Salt Lake City ( mother two child ) . We propose perform Phase Ib clinical trial test safety tolerability TD101 PC patient carry N171K mutation . We complete treatment adult patient prior recruitment minor .</brief_summary>
