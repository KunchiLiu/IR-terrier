	<brief_summary>Seven patient X-linked retinoschisis treat dorzolamide response treatment monitor use OCT . These patient also test causative gene mutation resultant mechanism functional loss retinoschisin . It observe response dorzolamide may see irrespective mechanism lead decrease function retinoschisin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Cystoid Macular Edema Patients With Retinal Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A percentage patient retinal degeneration , group progressive blinding disease , know develop fluid within center part retina know macular edema . Previous study document oral form carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ( acetazolamide ) effective reduce amount macular edema patient ( Archives Ophthalmology , 106:1190-1195 , 1988 ; 107:1445-1452 , 1989 ) . However , use oral form medication know cause clinically significant side effect fatigue loss appetite . A topical form carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , ( Trusopt ) promise similar beneficial effect retinal fluid systemic side effect observe oral form medication . In current study , propose use topical Trusopt group patient retinal degeneration ( RD ) determine efficacy reduce amount retinal fluid patient RD macular edema . The method involve initial one month treatment topical Trusopt three time day eye . After period one month , patient return follow-up examination . At baseline , measurement center vision measurement macular fluid photographic-like procedure term optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . After one month period treatment , measurement vision re-evaluation OCT. An improvement one line vision consider significant improvement . Since short-term intervisit variability area macular edema patient RD vary 11 % 16 % , reduction fluid least 25 % area consider clinically significant improvement macular edema .</detailed_description>
