	<brief_title>Dysfunctional Breathing Difficult Asthma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Dysfunctional breathing pattern prevalent patient diagnosis difficult treat asthma healthy volunteer . Design This open , prospective study , recruit sequential patient admit electively undergo difficult asthma protocol ( DAP ) . These patient generally admit period stability , still significant symptom despite asthma therapy . Healthy volunteer recruit hospital staff family friend . We recruit patient 12 18 month period hope enrol 60 patient . On final day 4 day admission , patient ask wear life vest 0800hrs . During morning undergo 6 minute walk test ass response exercise . They also review supervise consultant discus result investigation . While wear shirt , patient ask keep diary activity symptom . The Life Shirt remove patient time discharge . 20 Healthy volunteer recruit hospital staff . They ask wear life vest undertake normal daily activity . They also undertake 6 minute walk test . Tidal volume , minute volume respiratory rate record rest exertion , aid patient diary . Breathing pattern feature dysfunctional breathing , frequent sigh , also note . This subsequently correlate assessment supervise consultant regard presence dysfunctional breathing . Data also analyse regard whether difference healthy volunteer , patient felt asthma , felt asthma admit consultant .</detailed_description>
