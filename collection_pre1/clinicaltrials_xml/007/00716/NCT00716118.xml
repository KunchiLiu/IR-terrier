	<brief_title>Oocyte Cryopreservation : The Impact Cryopreservation Meiotic Spindle Mitochondria Human Oocytes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cryopreservation oocytes ( OC ) broad application field reproductive endocrinology management clinical problem fertile infertile patient . For example , young fertile woman diagnose malignancy may freeze oocyte initiate potentially toxic radiation chemical cancer therapy may render sterile . Using OC technology , establish frozen oocyte bank use healthy , compensated egg donor pre- screen use FDA criterion . Following appropriate quarantine time , oocyte thaw offer woman diagnose premature ovarian failure diminish ovarian reserve . This application OC already show promise eliminate logistical clinical complication associate traditional oocyte donation use fresh oocyte donor . From societal perspective , cryopreservation surplus oocytes IVF cycle may remove social moral objection surround embryo cryopreservation . Currently , frozen oocyte pregnancy rate ( 56 % ) equivalent frozen embryo pregnancy rate ( 45 % ) . Patients , complete family , find easy discard oocytes versus embryo . Finally , woman make personal choice delay childbearing may offer option preserve oocytes potential later use . The two distinct technique currently use oocyte cryopreservation : 1 ) controlled-rate freeze 2 ) vitrification . Controlled-rate freezing share similarity basic technology employ embryo cryopreservation nearly every IVF program . The technique involve slow freezing embryo cryoprotectant solution , often combine computer-controlled freezer regulate temperature change . Attempts improve understand oocyte cryobiology mostly empirical use trial error . Only limited experience gain adopt scientific model able predict effect `` cryo '' stress impose oocyte use various freeze method ( Fuller Paynter , 2004 ; Paynter , 2005 ) . In absence properly design study , advance clinical experience oocyte freezing limit . One major obstacle implementation oocyte freeze inability achieve reproducible high survival rate owe important effect intracellular organelle . For example , due sensitivity low temperature , metaphase II spindle always consider susceptible structural alteration potentially might interfere normal chromosome segregation meiosis II . Additionally , essential role mitochondrion normal cell function , fertilization early embryo development previously describe ( Jones et al. , 2004 ) . Our recently develop modify freeze-thaw protocol consistently show high recovery rate , lead optimism oocyte storage could last become available clinical practice . But remain demonstrated excellent post-thaw survival coincides cellular integrity unaltered developmental competence . Therefore , prior recommend adoption oocyte cryopreservation , one aim document possible effect cryo- preservation meiotic spindle mitochondrial level . An important aim study ass post-thaw viability organelle integrity oocyte use : 1 ) conservative technique [ PolScope analysis meiotic spindle ] 2 ) non-conservative technique [ Fluorescence microscopy analysis meiotic spindle mitochondrion ] use oocyte cryopreservation protocol . Continuing development freeze technology occur rapidly . It anticipate near future , egg freeze become successful embryo cryopreservation . Finally , clinical experience egg freeze accumulates , acceptable outcome data determine future egg freeze . Until , oocyte cryopreservation use carefully select clinical case full disclosure patient regard risk limited success rate .</detailed_description>
