	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic technique apply widely management various common pediatric surgical disease . Current evidence lack sufficient quality justify widespread adoption laparoscopic approach repair inguinal hernia within child . It important critically evaluate efficiency potential risk new technique supplant open technique treatment modality choice . Numerous large case series laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair report average length stay , complication rate , recurrence rate pain management score mirror open inguinal hernia repair . Only one randomize control trial perform compare open versus laparoscopic technique provide answer regard potential benefit young infant . Benefits open approach child include short operative time , laparoscopic procedure associate less pain well cosmetic result . This study compare open versus laparoscopic repair inguinal hernia . The primary outcome variable total dose acetaminophen administer postoperatively pain management . Secondary outcome variable include 1 ) Incidence intraoperative complication compromise testicular vessel , perforation abdominal viscera ; 2 ) Short-term outcomes operative time , rate conversion open laparoscopic procedure , requirement reoperation within 30 day , wound infection , acute hydrocele post-operative length stay ; 3 ) Long-term outcomes recurrent inguinal hernia , testicular atrophy ; 4 ) Cost hospitalization compare open laparoscopic group . Comparisons make two group patients- patient 1 ) unilateral hernia 2 ) bilateral hernia last 2 year . 102 patient unilateral arm 50 patient bilateral arm randomize treatment group subject follow 12 month follow surgical intervention . Two study evaluation telephone ( addition single outpatient clinic visit already require part standard post-operative care ) require research subject his/her parent/guardian . The telephone evaluation occur 3 12 month follow surgery . The standard post-operative clinic visit schedule 2 week follow surgery .</brief_summary>
