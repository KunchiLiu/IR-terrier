Somatic mutation gene relate tumorigenesis associate treatment response whereas germline gene variant associate tumor risk , prognosis treatment relate toxicity.Study objective : 1 . To characterise prevalence clinicopathological association germline somatic variation gene involve angiogenic pathway healthy donor unselected cancer patient 2 .

	<detailed_description>Angiogenesis play key role process tumour growth metastasis . Anti-angiogenic targeted therapy currently use wide range solid tumor include lung , breast , colorectal , kidney liver cancer . Somatic variant gene relate tumorigenesis associate treatment response , whereas germline gene variant associate tumor risk , prognosis treatment related toxicity . In study propose ( 1 ) To characterise prevalence clinicopathological association germline somatic variation gene involve angiogenic pathway healthy donor unselected cancer patient ( 2 ) examine association angiogenic gene variant outcome patient receive anti-angiogenic therapy . Genes related angiogenesis characterise include encode platelet derive growth factor receptor , vascular endothelial growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor , K-Ras , B-Raf , c-kit . Results study may ( 1 ) identify patient likely respond anti-angiogenic target therapy , thus maximise drug efficacy ( 2 ) identify target potential anti-angiogenic drug therapy .</detailed_description>
