	<detailed_description>Study type : Prospective , single-blinded , randomise control trial Consent - Prospective subject give write verbal information project give least 24 hour consider entry study . - Subjects give write consent participate project . The top copy include patient 's medical record copy place patient 's study file . - A letter write subject 's General Practitioner outline purpose study invite him/her make contact discus study detail query concern . - At time consent , appointment duration intervention potential follow-up make . Intervention treatment group A treatment series gentle joint muscle movement ( musculoskeletal intervention ) undertake physiotherapist , weekly , six week . A chaperone would available request subject ( patient would make aware inform study . ) Proposed Interventions The physiotherapy musculoskeletal assessment intervention may last one hour may include one combination follow technique well describe population postural change , thoracic stiffness , discomfort and/or pain : - Specific , gentle oscillatory mobilisation rib cage thoracic spine subject improve joint alignment mobility , reduce pain . These technique optimise chest wall mechanic , improve length-tension relationship muscle normalise movement dysfunctional area ( Maitland et al . 2001 ; Mulligan 2005 ) . - Treatment specific muscle dysfunction tight muscle group optimise muscle length biomechanical relationship area ( Massery 2005 ) , lead improved efficiency recruitment improve power output ( Travell &amp; Simons 1983 ) . - Neural stretch consist specific stretch neural system , improve neural dynamic aim reduce symptom , increase range motion optimise nerve conduction order normalise work relationship joint muscular component area ( Butler 1991 ) . - Neuromuscular technique restore normal movement facilitation . Guidance hand physiotherapist inhibits abnormal activity facilitate optimal muscular activity . Specific postural awareness exercise use educate re-establish normal movement , augment gain make treatment ( Carr &amp; Shepherd 1998 ) . - Home programme reinforce progress treatment session consist three specific stretch strengthening exercise . Control Group The control group would invite undertake measurement similar time interval treatment group ( 0 , 3 , 6 12 week ) . They receive usual care placebo intervention . The control group would offer treatment completion data collection study , intervention show beneficial . Potential Benefits - Improvement lung function - Improved thoracic excursion - Reduction chest wall pain - Improvement exercise capacity . Potential risk - Post treatment soreness last 24 hour . - In event undetected exclusion criterion potential rib fracture . - There may relative transient risk syncopal event vagal stimulation . Data Collection The outcome measure undertaken independent observer pre-agreed protocol , first intervention session ( Week 0 ) third ( Week 3 ) sixth treatment ( Week 6 ) . Full lung function repeat end intervention period . The outcome measurement repeat six week ( Week 12 ) follow end treatment explore sustainability treatment effect . On completion withdrawal study , subject invite complete exit interview questionnaire . Proposed Primary Outcome measure - Forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) . Secondary Outcome Measures - Forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) - Visual analogue scale pain ( Huskisson 1974 ) - Modified shuttle test ( Bradley et al . 1999 ) monitoring oxygen saturation heart rate Borg CR10 scale perceive exertion ( Borg 1982 ) . - The Cystic Fibrosis Quality Life Questionnaire , section one : physical function - Questionnaire I ( Gee et al . 2000 ) - Flexi curve measurement posture ( Tillotson &amp; Burton 1991 ) - Chest wall excursion measurement ( LaPier &amp; Cook 2000 ) - Full lung function measure ≤ one month prior start study end intervention period - Questionnaire II - subject 's perspective . Statistical Analysis report The statistical analysis discuss Mr Michael Roughton , Statistician , Royal Brompton Hospital Imperial College London . Sample size calculation As recent similar study available upon base sample size calculation pilot study . The study aim recruit 10 treatment group 10 control group . Statistical analysis The quantitative outcome analyse use Mann-Whitney test ( assume small set data normally distribute ) test difference variable baseline ; analyse assessment point establish beneficial length treatment sustainability effect . The result represent graphically table . In event miss data , withdrawal non-compliance patient analysed 'intention treat ' . Subjects allocate use `` method minimisation '' ( Evans , Day , &amp; Royston ) either control treatment group . This method weight number prognostic factor potential influence upon outcome ( e.g . FEV1 severity , sex subject ) . Two prognostic factor use reduce predictability group hey allocate . The subject allocate use method minimisation use computer generate randomisation schedule run minimisation algorithm thus ensure great chance subject allocate group optimise comparability group since number subject study small , allocation still subject randomisation principle . The randomisation carry independent member Department Cystic Fibrosis conceal independent observer . Adverse event Any adverse event document patient 's medical note , discuss medical staff report Chairman Ethics Committee . Data Protection Patient data cod protect identity . Written data kept lock file area within Department Cystic Fibrosis , Royal Brompton Hospital . Data analysis do password protect computer . Back-up maintain CD-ROM lock file area within Department Cystic Fibrosis .</detailed_description>
