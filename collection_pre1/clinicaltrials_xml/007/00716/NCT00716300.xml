	<brief_title>High Density Lipoprotein ( HDL ) Functionality Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Purpose This Study : The metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) characterize impaired glucose insulin metabolism ( insulin resistance ) , abnormal body fat distribution call central obesity ( pot belly ) high blood pressure . People metabolic syndrome markedly increase risk heart disease mainly attribute abnormal fat metabolism associate metabolic disorder . Therefore , understand body fat disorder important reduce incidence severity heart disease . Fats blood originate dietary source production liver . They deliver peripheral body cell utilization storage . A particular protein , call high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) apolipoprotein ( apo ) A-I , important fat carrier responsible transporting excess fat cell , via bloodstream , back liver . Low HDL-apoA-I concentration relate increase risk heart disease . Subjects MetS reduce level apoA-I wish test hypothesis responsible impaired movement fat periphery liver . Recent evidence suggest functionality HDL , include anti-oxidant , anti-inflammatory cholesterol efflux property , also important prevent development heart disease . However , function test yet investigate extensively MetS . Consequently , wish examine transport anti-atherogenic property HDL subject MetS compare normal lean subject . Such finding would significant clinical importance understanding diverse role HDL-apoA-I reduce prevent progression heart disease . Participation : Patients MetS lean individual recruit study via newspaper advertisement . Following informed consent find suitable participation , 15 men MetS 15 lean men enrol . We give participant harmless substance call stable ( non-radioactive ) isotope . The isotope trace speed apoA-I release blood ( production ) remove bloodstream ( clearance ) liver . Participants ask fast ( water allow ) 12 hour prior isotope study . The stable isotope administer intravenous injection form clear fluid ( total volume approximate 15 25ml , 1-1.5 tablespoon ) . A small plastic tube ( cannula ) place vein arm , total 160mll ( 10.5 tablespoon ) blood obtain . The isotope study last 10 hour , participant rest quietly allow water . At end study day , participant give meal allow home taxi family transport . These study allow u measure metabolic action apolipoprotein A-I , thereby gain well understanding mechanisms lead abnormal blood fat level MetS . To complete study , participant require attend 7 visit 6-week period . Benefits : All participant receive health education , well information personal health status review heart risk factor .</detailed_description>
