	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study Biologic Lung Volume Reduction ( BLVR ) System Advanced Upper Lobe Predominant ( ULP ) Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients emphysema currently limit treatment choice . Many patient treat steroid inhaled medication , often provide little benefit . In recent year , lung volume reduction surgery become accept therapy advanced emphysema . Lung volume reduction surgery involve removal diseased portion lung order enable remain , healthy portion lung function well . This procedure , although effective many patient , complicate accompany substantial morbidity mortality risk . Aeris Therapeutics develop Biologic Lung Volume Reduction ( BLVR ) System achieve lung volume reduction without surgery attendant risk . With BLVR , physician us bronchoscope direct treatment damage area patient 's lung . The treatment delivers precisely proportion proprietary mixture drug biologics , combine treatment site , form bioabsorbable gel . The gel comprise clot protein deliver treatment , antibiotic prevent infection drug design remodel damage area lungsâ€”actually use body 's natural scar formation response permanently collapse diseased area . This reduction lung volume create space adjacent healthier part lung function effectively .</detailed_description>
