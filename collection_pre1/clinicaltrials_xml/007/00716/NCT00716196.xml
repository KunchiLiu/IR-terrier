	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Thin Prep Versus Papanicolau Suspected Malignant Lesions During Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : The presence pathologist endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) often luxury . In addition , preparation multiple slide fine needle aspiration time-consuming gastroenterologist wait verbal feedback adequacy specimen . Often , timely diagnosis need direct patient management . Currently , establish standard care EUS-FNA preparation . A liquid base cytologic fixative preparation ( Thin-prep CytoLyt ) , well-established process use pathologist evaluate cervical smear . It yet adopt accepted EUS-FNA . This method combine multiple aspirate single slide , thereby decrease number slide need process interpreted pathologist</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects know suspected malignancy ( solid mass lymph node ) undergo EUS eligible participate study . Target lesion ascites cystic lesion consider study . However , patient abnormal solid lesion abnormal lymph node addition ascites cystic lesion , may still consider study . That , solid lesion abnormal lymph node appropriate target lesion study . No evidence dementia alter mental status would prohibit give understand informed consent , evidence psychiatric risk would preclude adequate compliance protocol . Subject must provide sign write informed consent . Subjects previous EUSFNA eligible study Target lesion ascites cystic lesion consider study .</criteria>
