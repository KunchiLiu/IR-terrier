	<brief_summary>Computed tomography ( CT ) scan use intravenous contrast ( CT IV ) sole type contrast material , study one method evaluate child suspect appendicitis . We felt technique could provide physician faster better-tolerated alternative CT image involve patient drink oral contrast need rectal contrast administer . SPECIFIC AIMS 1 . To test image protocol use CT IV evaluation suspect appendicitis child set pediatric emergency department ( ED ) . 2 . To determine test performance characteristic ( specificity , sensitivity diagnostic accuracy ) CT IV detect appendicitis child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT Scan Using IV Contrast Alone Pediatric Appendicitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study image pediatric patient ( 3-18 year old ) diagnosis appendicitis suspect , clinically apparent . Patients CT perform would invite participate enrol , would image use CT scan IV contrast alone . CT scan would interpret real time resident radiologist and/or attend radiologist . ED evaluation would remain unchanged patient disposition would base discretion ED provider use information ( patient exam , lab , surgical consultation need result CT scan ) . CT scan performance would determine comparison CT interpretation patient final outcome determine either ( 1 ) pathology report - patient go surgery ( appendectomy ) ( 2 ) clinical phone follow 24 hr 1 week ED discharge . Performance CT would compare resident attend radiologist . Further , would compare time obtain CT scan ( defined ED triage time - Time CT ) study cohort retrospective cohort patient receive CT scan ED evaluation appendicitis pre-study ( CT use BOTH IV oral contrast ) .</detailed_description>
