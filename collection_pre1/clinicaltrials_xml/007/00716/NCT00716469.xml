	<brief_summary>Plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) represent one significant complication NF1 . They significant cause morbidity neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) cause pain , impaired function , disfigurement . They may become life-threatening mechanical compression vital organ trachea , great vessel , spinal cord , may significantly interfere normal function locate extremity orbit . The effective therapy PN total surgical excision . However , due local infiltration normal tissue , gross total resection usually feasible , often PN completely unresectable due location , size , multiplicity . To date , therapeutic modality , include radiotherapy chemotherapy , show efficacy PN . In present study , local photodynamic therapy investigate . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) utilize drug , call photosensitizer photosensitize agent , particular type light . When photosensitizers expose specific wavelength light , produce form oxygen kill nearby cell . PDT expect result treatment response shrinkage tumor . The main purpose study determine maximum amount light safely use LS11 PDT child plexiform neurofibroma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Clinical Study Safety Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) Using LS11 Children With Plexiform Neurofibromas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment option PN limit . The effective therapy PN complete surgical resection . Incompletely resected lesion high incidence recurrence , often result necessity several surgery patient 's lifetime . Development non-surgical treatment PN high priority . To date , therapeutic modality , include radiotherapy chemotherapy , show efficacy PN , although arguable modality sufficiently study . Newer approach , include anti-angiogenesis agent , farnesyl transferase inhibitor , inhibitor growth factor pathways development study , clearly proven therapy . Investigational Agent LS11 , talaporfin sodium , specifically develop photosensitize agent use photodynamic therapy . The light activation LS11 lead formation singlet oxygen cause damage vascular endothelial cell lead vascular thrombosis occlusion . Phase I II study conduct US Japan use LS11 . PDT LS11 generally well tolerated study serious adverse event note . PDT novel treatment modality systemically administer photosensitizer ( LS11 proposal ) activate locally illuminate diseased tissue light specific wavelength . Light activation LS11 lead formation reactive oxygen specie cause damage vascular endothelial cell lead vascular thrombosis occlusion subsequently death tumor cell . Light Source Placement : Ultrasound may use monitor percutaneous implantation Light Source . However , position implant Light Source must verify computed tomography ( CT ) . - Use RITA introducer trochar . - Make small incision skin . - Insert introducer tumor advance desire position target tissue ( use ultrasound CT verify placement ) . - Remove trochar . - Insert Light Source catheter end sheath . ( Avoid mechanical damage device , twist , kink , exert force insertion ) . - Pull sheath back least 4 centimeter ( cm ) ( Light Source remain position pull back sheath ) . - Verify Light Source tip location CT. Reposition necessary . - The sheath may remove completely , verify Light Source tip location , physician 's discretion - Record distance lesion surface vital structure implant light source . - Secure Light Source LS11 Administration : - Since compatibility LS11 drug establish , LS11 mix physically added drug . - Every effort make avoid extravasation LS11 surround tissue . The extravasated drug may pose prolonged photosensitivity risk tissue near injection site . - To avoid extravasation , establish intravenous ( IV ) line ensure free flow saline dextrose water . If heparin lock use , flush thoroughly saline . - LS11 slowly ( 3-5 minute ) administer intravenously single dose 30 mg/m2 40 mg/m2 . - Following injection line flush least 10 cc saline dextrose water . - In case extravasation , site thoroughly rinse saline water carefully bandage protect area room- sun-light . The photosensitivity extravasate site last longer general cutaneous photosensitivity . - Record administration start time end time . Physical exam , blood test , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) perform prior start study regularly treatment per protocol . Light Exposure Precautions Following PDT-Instructions Patients : Patients sensitive light must observe precaution reduce exposure skin eye direct sunlight bright indoor light 14 day . The sensitivity light due residual drug present part skin eye . To minimize skin reaction due light exposure LS11 administration , precaution take detailed protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age : Patients must ≥ 3 ≤ 21 year age . Tumor : Patients must debilitate , severely disfigure , lifethreatening , progressive plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) , surgically resectable standard medical management . Measurable Disease : Patients must measurable PN assess MRI within 2 week prior start therapy . Tumor Size/Shape/Location : All tumor must : 1. minimum dimension ≥ 5 cm plane intend 25mm length Light Source insertion 2. minimum dimension ≥ 3.15 cm perpendicular plane intend 25mm length Light Source insertion 3. accessible percutaneous CT ( ultrasound need ) guide Light Source insertion ; 4. shape location minimum distance Light Source `` critical structure '' ( define section 4.3.4 ) follow : Minimum radial distance = 2.5 cm Minimum distance proximal end Light Source = 2.5 cm Minimum distance distal end Light Source = 2 cm For patient NF1 : In addition PN , study subject must least one diagnostic criterion NF1 . Performance Status : Patients life expectancy least 6 month Karnofsky ( ≥ 16 year age ) Lansky ( ≤16 year age ) Performance Score ≥ 60 . Prior/Concurrent Therapy : Patients must recover specific acute toxicity associate prior therapy . No concurrent antitumor therapy allow . Laboratory : Patients must adequate bone marrow , renal , hepatic function assess within 7 day prior start therapy . 1 . Hematologic : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/ul Platelet count ≥ 100,000/ul Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL PT/PTT ≤ 1.2 time institutional upper limit normal 2 . Renal : Serum creatinine within upper limit institutional norm 3 . Hepatic : Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal age ALT ≤ 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal age Albumin ≥ 2 g/dL Pregnancy : Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test . Patient must pregnant breastfeeding . Patients childbearing child father potential must willing use medically acceptable form birth control , include abstinence , treat study . Informed Consent : All patient legal guardian ( patient le 18 year old ) must sign IRB approve document inform consent indicate understanding investigational nature risk study begin therapy . When appropriate , pediatric patient include discussion order obtain verbal assent . Patients &lt; 3 &gt; 21 year age . Tumors debilitate , severely disfigure , lifethreatening , progressive Patients baseline pain neuropathy relate target lesion severe effect activity daily live ( i.e . grade 3 4 ) . Tumors would require Light Source placement `` critical structure '' within minimum distance require `` critical structure '' Light Source . Tumor inaccessible percutaneous implantation light source interventional radiology . Patients history porphyria . Concomitant use drug know produce skin photosensitivity ( e.g . tetracycline , sulfonamide , phenothiazine , sulfonylurea , thiazide diuretic , griseofulvin ) Patients serious medical illness , investigator 's opinion , would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . Patients receive chemotherapeutics investigational agent . Patients uncontrolled infection . Patients take NSAIDs anticoagulant .</criteria>
