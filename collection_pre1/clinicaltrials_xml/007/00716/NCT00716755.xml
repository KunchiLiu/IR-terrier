	<brief_summary>Since side effect antipsychotic , dopamine D2 receptor blocker , frequently occur old patient schizophrenia risk dose dependent , clinical guideline universally advocate use low dos . However , report test dose guideline measurement D2 receptor blockade cause antipsychotic . In study , dopamine D2 receptor occupancy measure , use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) , 40 patient age 50 old schizophrenia-spectrum disorder gradual 40 % dose reduction antipsychotic safely achieve past study set target dose still low limit dose range recommend clinical guideline old patient .

	<brief_title>Minimizing Doses Antipsychotic Medication Older Patients With Schizophrenia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antipsychotics play central role treatment schizophrenia irrespective patient 's age . Aging associate increased sensitivity drug adverse effect , include adverse effect antipsychotic . This concern reflect clinical guideline recommend use low dos antipsychotic elderly patient . For example , Expert Consensus Guideline recommend dose risperidone 1.25 - 3.5 mg/d old patient age 65 old schizophrenia , compare recommend dose 2.5 - 6.5 mg/d young patient . For olanzapine recommend dose 7.5 mg/day . The risk adverse effect antipsychotic drug dose-related contributes poor adherence bad outcome . In addition `` objective '' ( sense externally manifest ) adverse effect include motor autonomic side effect , long recognize antipsychotic also associate negative subjective sense well-being term `` neuroleptic dysphoria '' . This adverse effect recently return limelight literature since critical implication adherence recovery , also associate level striatal D2 receptor occupancy associate motor side effect typical atypical antipsychotic . Conceptually , therefore , consider subtle non-motor form extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) may manifest dos low motor EPS may indeed represent true `` neuroleptic threshold '' describe McEvoy two decade ago . Thus , optimal dose antipsychotic drug ( clinical level D2 occupancy ) would expect lead well subjective experience , result enhanced adherence antipsychotic drug . Atypical antipsychotic drug report show differential effect weight gain metabolic side effect , effect dose establish olanzapine risperidone . The effect dose prolactin elevation also report , raise concern risk osteoporosis less extent breast carcinoma . Finally , motor side-effects perhaps best know dose-related consequence antipsychotic drug , particularly true risperidone . Lemmen et al . show high dos antipsychotic report associated development EPS combine analysis 12 double-blind trial risperidone , include 2,074 patient ; moreover , influence factor prominent elderly . Furthermore , high cumulative amount prescribe antipsychotic report increase risk develop tardive dyskinesia . These motor side-effects often impair activity daily live also expect associate undesirable incident fall aspiration . In addition , EPS report associated cognitive dysfunction , although still uncertain extent EPS affect cognitive impairment directly indirectly . Risperidone olanzapine widely use antipsychotic drug , risperidone market use behavioral disturbance dementia United States . Moreover , available generic form , make widely available . Our clinical experience , well preliminary data CAMH , suggest dose guideline elderly patient schizophrenia may universally follow patient ' dosing may necessarily adjust age ( personal communication , Dr Beth Sproule ) . Given dose-related concern , age-related sensitivity , recent concern excess mortality patient dementia treated atypical antipsychotic , reasonable standard practice gradually reduce dose antipsychotic increase age patient schizophrenia . Gradual antipsychotic dose reduction successfully complete naturalistic study , carefully select patient ( n = 27 ) schizophrenia relate psychotic disorder age 45 year old . A 40 % dose reduction ( mean dose 190 110 mg chlorpromazine equivalent ) tolerate 70 % sample experienced increase psychotic symptom 6 month , suggest old patient tolerate low dose antipsychotic without adverse clinical outcome . Further , subject demonstrated worsen psychotic symptom stabilize within several day small increase neuroleptic dosage last dosage patient stabilized patient require hospitalization . These result consistent documented safety clinical value gradual antipsychotic dose reduction young patient schizophrenia . Previous PET study adult patient schizophrenia show clinical response unlikely striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy 65 % , conversely motor side effect likely occupancy excess 80 % . This therapeutic window risperidone term occupancy consistent clinical therapeutic dose range 2 - 6 mg , 2 mg dose barely reach occupancy threshold 65 % . The low dose range recommend clinical guideline elderly patient schizophrenia ( 1.25 - 3.5 mg risperidone ) suggest therapeutic window lower elderly patient . Thus dose antipsychotic either upper limit dose range , limit would expect associated subjective objective EPS , warrant trial lower dose per guideline . Indeed , Tort et al simulate relationship plasma level D2 occupancy atypical antipsychotic drug base affinity D2 receptor conclude presence EPS antipsychotic dose could well halve resultant D2 occupancy would expect stay well within D2 occupancy therapeutic window 65-80 % . If elderly patient schizophrenia indeed respond show maintenance wellness lower dos , suggest one follow mechanism may involve : ( ) give dose reach equivalent plasma level young patient , ( b ) give plasma drug level achieve high central occupancy , ( c ) show clinical response low level occupancy . We propose prospective study assess dopamine D2 receptor occupancy gradual 40 % dose reduction risperidone olanzapine safely achieve patient age 45 past study set target dose low limit dose range recommend clinical guideline , ie. , 1.5 mg/day 7.5 mg/day risperidone olanzapine respectively , old patient . Our goal relate change clinical outcome , include subjective objective clinical rating , striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy , compare result data young patient literature .</detailed_description>
