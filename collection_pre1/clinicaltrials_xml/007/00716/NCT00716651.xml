	<brief_summary>Churg-Strauss syndrome rare type systemic vasculitis occur almost exclusively patient asthma characterize prominent blood tissue eosinophilia . The disease chronic smolder course permanent need medium high corticosteroid dos . Available unselective immunosuppressive agent often insufficient reduce corticosteroid dos , induce complete remission protect patient disease flare occur 50 % case . Interleukin-5 potent cytokine regulate production eosinophil granulocytes major effector cell Churg-Strauss syndrome . Recently , increased production interleukin-5 demonstrate Churg-Strauss syndrome . Mepolizumab monoclonal IgG antibody target interleukin-5 effective treatment HES . The hypothesis study , mepolizumab induce remission allow steroid reduction .</brief_summary>
