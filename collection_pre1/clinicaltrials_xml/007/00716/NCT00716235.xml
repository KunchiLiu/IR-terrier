	<brief_title>Characterization Executive Functions Patterns Eye Movements Children With Developmental Disabilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abnormal Executive function ( EF ) profile consider major characteristic Attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) autism , frequently implicate Developmental coordination disorder ( DCD ) child well . The scientific literature implies EF profile among three group share common abnormality , differ significantly specific feature . Abnormal EF profile may core feature developmental trajectory syndrome . The fine measurement eye movement may shed light underlie mechanisms specific disorder , point abnormal attention , information processing , motor organization . Gaze important component social interaction . Eye contact recognition 's gaze direction crucial empathy assessment . The current study embark assessment wide range EF population match control group , well relation important parameter daily function skill comorbid neurobehavioral characteristic . It also assess pattern eye movement response various visual stimulus population . The main purpose characterize similarity difference population , term EF eye movement . Assessment method : Clinical parameter : - Intelligence test ( accord child 's age ) - Communication : DSM-IV , ADOS , Stony Brook questionnaire - Motor / Coordination : Movement Advanced Battery Children ( M-ABC ) - Attention : Conners Rating Scales - Revised ( CRS-R 3rd ed . ) - Sleep : Sleep habit questionnaire Executive function assess use follow method : - NEPSI-II - BRIEF questionnaire - Wisconsin Card Sorting Test - Tower Hanoi Eye movement measure use infra-red video camera produce ISCAN inc. follow visual stimulus present : - Human face present various emotion - Various object - Saccade anti-saccade task</detailed_description>
