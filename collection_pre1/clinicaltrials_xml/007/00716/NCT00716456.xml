	<brief_summary>The purpose study test cetuximab ( Erbitux ) shrink lung cancer initially become small take erlotinib start get big despite continue treatment . Cetuximab medicine approve U.S. Food Drug administration treatment head neck colon cancer . The goal phase I portion trial find high dose cetuximab take together erlotinib . This study also give idea well cetuximab shrink lung cancer give erlotinib . The purpose study test cetuximab ( Erbitux ) shrink lung cancer initially become small take erlotinib gefitinib start get big despite continue treatment . Cetuximab medicine approve U.S. Food Drug administration treatment head neck colon cancer . The goal phase determine cetuximab give erlotinib cause lung cancer shrink size .</brief_summary>
