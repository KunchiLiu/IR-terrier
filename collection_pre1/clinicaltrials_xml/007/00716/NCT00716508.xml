	<brief_title>Surgical Treatment Acute Patella Tendon Rupture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patella tendon locate knee , attach leg bone patella bone ( knee cap ) . The quadriceps muscle ( important tight muscle ) attach patella bone allow extension flexion leg . Rupture patella tendon occur mainly people age 40 year old active lifestyle . Normally , surgical repair need fix injury . The widely accept surgery injury consist drill 2 hole patella bone use anchor patella tendon place . This surgery complication re-rupture tendon , breakage bone , etc . Some investigator try different technique avoid complication variable result . We want use 2 anchor bone avoid making hole patella bone , decrease complication surgical time , hopefully , allow well surgical repair . We 2 arm . One group standard care technique second group anchor technique . We follow patient surgery record progress , complication , . We also standardize physical therapy program consistency avoid problem .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Stage Disease : Acute rupture patella tendon , 3 week since time injury . 2 . Age : 18 year old . 3 . Performance status : Patients previous illness prevent ambulate normally ( without help device ) . 4 . Informed consent requirement : One person research staff approach patient diagnosis make . The diagnosis make doctor charge patient care base medical history , physical exam image study ( MRI ) . We explain benefits/risks part study obligate part part care . 1 . Prior treatment : Patients chronic patella tendon rupture ( 3 week ) . 2 . Prior disease : disease systemic collagen deficiency . 3 . Infection : Patients active infection disqualify .</criteria>
