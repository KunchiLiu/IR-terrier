	<detailed_description>Inpatient Use Omegaven : Each family severity child 's condition explain available data regard benefit novel preparation explain use preliminary safety efficacy data Boston Children 's Hospital TCH . Families potential risk benefit product explain . The lack long-term follow-up information regard effect Omegaven discuss . Bottles contain 50mL 100 mL 10 % Omegaven purchase International Pharmacy Hamburg , Germany . Omegaven manufacture Fresenius Kabi AG , Bad Homburg v.d.h , Germany . Omegaven formulate emulsion fish oil . The family ( legal guardian ) bill Omegaven part hospital bill Texas Children 's Hospital . Omegaven dispense per Texas Children 's Hospital policy procedure fat emulsion . All study material store securely time administration . The bottle store room temperature 30° C ( freeze ) . Damaged suspect drug return unused Fresenius- Kabi . Containers shaken use . All supply study accompany accountability ship document maintain Investigator deputy ( e.g . research pharmacist ) . Information record accountability shipping document include relevant date , batch number , quantity receive dispensed , dispense , return drug , drug lose damage . At end study , use unused Omegaven account . If expire , remain drug supply destroy . Details Omegaven Administration : Therapy Omegaven provide dose 1 gm/kg/day ( continuous infusion ) . Omegaven infuse intravenously either central peripheral catheter conjunction parenteral nutrition . Parenteral fat emulsion ( Intralipid ) administer necessary administer adequate calorie Omegaven therapy . The standard care provide patient receive parenteral nutrition solution follow . Ongoing monitor therapy relate safety efficacy : Safety assess use follow outcome variable . First , calculate number ( total daily rate ) bloodstream infection prior therapy . We monitor rate baby receive Omegaven compare previous rate . Currently , rate infection infant receive Omegaven half historical control rate TCH . Second , monitor growth rate use weight , length head circumference growth . Growth compare pre-treatment period expect rate growth . We establish guideline optimal growth target management target achieve rate . We monitor carefully . For baby NICU Level 2 nursery , Dr. Abrams supervise nutritional management directly . Infants PICU PCU follow Dr. Carter critical care staff . This approach place current group 16 infant growth excellent although final calculation pending . Third , monitor infant receive enteral feed 4 week evidence essential fatty acid ( EFA ) deficiency . Measurements repeat end every 4 week subject remain without enteral nutrition intake . Although exact value suggestive deficiency controversial , usually level great 0.4 consider evidence EFA deficiency . This measurement may make use 0.2 mL serum lab Dr. William Heird . Samples draw monthly infant NPO run batch Dr. Heird 's lab CNRC every 6 month . Because data available clinical use , include consent possibility EFA deficiency . We note infant ever treat Omegaven ever show clinical evidence EFA deficiency , transient mild deficiency may occur 5 % infant clinical intervention would use case ever give without clinically apparent EFA deficiency . Fourth , record monitor follow lab clinical result DSMB : electrolyte , calcium , phosphorus , magnesium , alkaline phosphatase , glucose , triglyceride , BUN , creatinine , conjugate unconjugated bilirubin , albumin , prealbumin , CRP , WBC , RBC , platelet , PT , PTT , evidence bleeding , positive blood culture . These labs drawn clinically relevant , specific result study . Finally , regard developmental follow-up indicate family infant cholestasis may risk developmental delay recommend follow . There mechanism place assure follow-up occur infant TCH nursery however . Dose Modification Hypertriglyceridemia : If hypertriglyceridemia develop , define serum triglyceride level &gt; 300 mg/dL , follow consider prior reduce dose : 1 . If level obtain patient receive continuous 24- hour infusion Omegaven , total dose infuse 20 hour , repeat serum triglyceride level obtain prior resume infusion 4 hour later . 2 . Other source hypertriglyceridemia consider addressed ( drug , renal disease ) If necessary triglyceride continue remain high despite aforementioned intervention , dosage reduction 25 % consider . Duration Therapy Patients remain Omegaven wean PN . In event patient list liver liver/intestinal transplant organ become available , participation protocol preclude receive transplant . Omegaven administer post transplant . Treatment give long child need TPN AND conjugate bilirubin great 2 mg/dL maximum 5 month . If infant long require TPN , Omegaven stop regardless bilirubin . If bilirubin less 2 mg/dL child still require TPN , Omegaven continue total 5 month whenever infant long require TPN . The reason stop Omegaven infant longer require TPN would reason many infant would still need IV access therefore risk maintain IV access medication likely exceed benefit Omegaven point . Legal Ethics Requirements : This study approve BCM IRB FDA Investigational New Drug Application use IND # 102,843 . The Investigators responsible obtain Informed Consent sign patient his/her legally authorize representative prior his/her participation study accordance Code Federal Regulations , Title 21 , Part 50.20 . Informed Consent obtain patient his/her legally authorize representative full explanation purpose study , risk discomfort involve , potential benefit , etc . provide Investigator designee , verbally write . The person sign consent give copy sign consent form . The lack long-term follow-up information regard effect Omegaven discuss . Home Use Omegaven : In order subject receive Omegaven® home home health care agency , subject first require admit Texas Children 's Hospital 72 hour initiate administration Omegaven® . This allow time observation unexpected side effect parent provide education home TPN Omegaven® . If subject already receive Omegaven® either TCH another hospital , require admit 72 hour inpatient admission prior start Omegaven® home . Parent train occur previous hospital admission continue TCH Pediatric Intestinal Rehabilitation Clinic . This population include infant 5 year age . The Omegaven® dose home use use hospital : 1 gm/kg/day . As inpatient part protocol , maximum dose may decrease discretion TCH Pediatric Intestinal Rehabilitation Clinic Team . Outpatient Monitoring : After initial evaluation TCH Pediatric Intestinal Rehabilitation Clinic physician , subject return clinic routine follow-up . Subjects ask return clinic every 2 week first 2 month treatment . Thereafter , subject return clinic monthly basis , direct clinic team . Orders home use Omegaven® sign physician clinic visit , ensure subject compliant study parameter receive treatment drug . Routine monitoring do clinic appointment home record study purpose data collection . No blood work do study purpose . Lab monitoring typically do every week two week home clinic visit .
