	<detailed_description>High level serum cholesterol risk factor atherosclerotic complication , include atherosclerotic aortic valve disease . Over 50 year dietary plant sterol use inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption decrease level serum . Daily human diet contain numerous different plant sterol , sitosterol campesterol abundant one . Few epidemiologic study suggest sitosterol campesterol may also involve formation atherosclerotic change human artery . The saturated form sitosterol campesterol , i.e. , plant stanols ( mainly sitostanol campestanol ) beneficial respect . As part daily diet , plant stanols decrease absorption cholesterol plant sterol , thus , putatively even effective prevention atherosclerosis respective plant sterol . Our double-blind control intervention study unravels influence dietary plant sterol stanols structure sterol composition human aortic valve . 50-60 patient , undergo aortic valve surgery , ask volunteer study . The patient randomize three group : ( A ) group consume margarine contain daily 2 gram plant stanols , ( E ) group consume margarine contain daily 2 gram plant sterol , ( C ) control group consume margarine without plant sterol stanols . The dietary intervention last 4 8 week randomization operation . Serum sample analysis serum lipid , lipoproteins sterol collect randomization operation . The atherosclerotic aortic valve examine respect composition cholesterol , sterols stanols . The aim study elucidate effect dietary consumption plant sterols stanols sterol composition structure atherosclerotic disease-affected aortic valve human patient .</detailed_description>
