	<brief_summary>We propose examine absorption excretion zinc copper infant ostomy . This accomplish measure baseline excretion serum level zinc , copper , ceruloplasmin , utilize stable isotope zinc copper measure absorption excretion . To determine presence ileostomy impact zinc copper metabolism infant three time point : 1 ) infant ostomy receive majority calorie total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) ; 2 ) infant ostomy receive primarily enteral nutrition without TPN ; 3 ) when/if infant surgery reconnect bowel receive primarily enteral nutrition . For first part study , excretion data zinc obtain ostomy patient . We hypothesize infant ostomy excrete zinc stool healthy term preterm infant without ostomy . For second part study , obtain data zinc absorption , secretion , excretion use stable isotope . Jalla et al determine healthy infant retain zinc 0.4 mg/day . We hypothesize due increase zinc loss , infant study less positive healthy infant study Jalla et al . Our study design able detect ostomy patient net retention one-half describe Jalla ( i.e . 0.2 mg/d ) . We also obtain data copper absorption , secretion , excretion use stable isotope second part study . As pilot study , fully know expect regard copper level infant ostomy , hypothesize may less positive healthy infant without ostomy . Also , hypothesize zinc copper competitively absorbed gut ; therefore , infant receive zinc may absorb less copper . For third part study , obtain data zinc absorption use stable isotope infant surgery reanastomose bowel . We hypothesize may continue zinc loss document healthy infant never ostomy , decreased loss compare infant ostomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential subject identify study personnel Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICU ) Texas Children 's Hospital Ben Taub General Hospital . The parent/guardian approached study explain full . A time question allow . Once parent/guardian agree his/her child 's participation , inform write consent form sign . Subject confidentiality maintain within limit law . All name personal information access investigator authorized personnel . There possibility coercion subject relationship dependency investigator . We intend ass zinc copper metabolism three time point : first , infant ostomy receive primarily intravenous nutrition , call total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) , minimal enteral feed ( ie , feed gastrointestinal tract ) ; second , infant ostomy receive primarily enteral nutrition without TPN ; third , when/if infant surgery reconnect bowel remove ostomy . Using stable isotope technique second third part , measure intake compare excretion ( stool ostomy urine ) . A stable isotope naturally occur form mineral measure , trace , body . It radioactive know risk . Part 1 : This part include stable isotope . We collect ostomy urine output 24 hour determine zinc copper content ostomy output urine . A small collection blood ( 2 mL ) also obtain time routine blood test do . This blood test zinc , copper , ceruloplasmin level . If infant replogle gastric tube , gastric residual collect 24 hour stool ostomy collect . If reason Part 1 able perform subject meet criteria Part 2 , subject drop . Part 1 consider optional . The following measured : zinc intake ( zinc content TPN ) , endogenous fecal excretion ( ostomy gastric output ) urinary zinc excretion ( urine collection ) . Zinc balance estimate difference zinc intake zinc output ( ostomy , urine , gastric fluid ) . Copper balance measure difference copper intake ( TPN ) copper loss ( ostomy , urine gastric fluid ) . Part 2 : The second part study occur infant reach full enteral feeding ( minimum 100 cc/kg/day ) TPN discontinue . This part study include stable isotope . Infants receive steady state volume concentration feeding per kg least two ( 2 ) day throughout first 24 hour sample collection period . The time record infant receives first isotope mark begin sample collection period . Infants may receive either breast milk ( fortified unfortified ) infant formula . If infant receive breast milk , 10mL sample breast milk obtain determine zinc copper content . Zinc copper content infant formula determine publish table manufacturer . The infant receive 1 mg Zn67 80 mcg Cu65 stable isotope orally mixed one infant 's morning feeding study day . In addition , infant receive 0.1 mg Zn70 intravenous stable isotope . Stool collect ostomy bag 72 hour . A urine bag place infant 's skin collect urine 24 hour , follow spot urine sample collection twice day three ( 3 ) day isotope infusion . The final urine collection occur approximately 96 hour isotope infusion . A small amount blood ( 2 mL ) also take time intravenous isotope infusion . This blood test zinc , copper , ceruloplasmin level . Fractional zinc absorption endogenous fecal zinc excretion measure use stable isotope . Urinary excretion measure urine collection . Zinc balance calculate difference absorb zinc ( intake x fractional absorption ) zinc loss ( urinary excretion endogenous fecal zinc excretion ) . Fractional copper absorption measure difference intake Cu65 loss Cu65 ( ostomy urine ) . Copper balance measure difference total copper intake total copper loss ( ostomy urine ) . Part 3 : The third part study occur infant surgery reconnect bowel remove ostomy . A spot urine sample obtain prior stable isotope infusion ensure isotope previously consumed/infused consider data analysis part study . The stable isotope study occur whenever infant 's bowel reconnected infant achieve steady volume concentration feeding per kg ( minimum 100 cc/kg/day ) least 2 day . This volume continue throughout first 24 hour sample collection period . Infants may receive either breast milk ( fortified unfortified ) infant formula . If infant receive breast milk , 10mL sample breast milk obtain determine zinc copper content . Zinc copper content infant formula determine publish table manufacturer . As ostomy bag remove , difficult obtain stool sample 72 hour . Therefore , measure zinc urine excretion , secretion able assess copper balance time point . The infant receive 1 mg Zn67 orally mix one infant 's morning feeding study day . In addition , infant receive 0.1 mg Zn70 intravenously . A small collection blood ( 2 mL ) also take time isotope infusion . This blood test zinc , copper , ceruloplasmin level . One spot urine sample obtain 96 hour first isotope receive . Study-related information record medical record include type volume enteral feeding , volume concentration TPN , anthropometrics , nutrition-related lab result routine blood draw ( ie , BUN , creatinine , electrolytes , bilirubin , calcium , phosphorus , alkaline phosphatase , triglyceride ) , ostomy urine output . Recognizing possibility every infant surgery reconnect bowel , consent form clearly state child may may eligible Part 3 .</detailed_description>
