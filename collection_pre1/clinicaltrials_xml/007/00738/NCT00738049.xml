	<detailed_description>This 6-week , Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , crossover , investigator-initiated , single-center study determine feasibility detect effect darusentan 100 mg daily extent myocardial perfusion heterogeneity subject document CAD , measure cardiac PET imaging . Prior initiation study procedure , Informed Consent Form HIPAA Authorization review sign subject . Screening assessment evaluation may conduct period 4 week . Following baseline PET scan ( PET 1 ) subject randomize one two treatment group ( Group 1 Group 2 ) , receive blind treatment total 4 week . The 4-week treatment period two phase , Phase 1 Phase 2 . Group 1 receive darusentan 100 mg 2 week Phase 1 , placebo 2 week Phase 2 . Group 2 receive placebo 2 week Phase 1 , darusentan 100 mg 2 week Phase 2 . Following 4 week treatment blind study drug , subject treatment group withdraw study drug additional 2 week . Maximum darusentan exposure study 2 week , maximum placebo exposure study 2 week . Adjustments number dosage concomitant medication require study entry permit time study . A physical exam do baseline week 6 well blood chemistry hematology sample take . Vital sign adverse event monitor visit . Efficacy assess cardiac PET imaging . In total , four PET scan administer : first Randomization Visit ( PET 1 , Week 0 ) ; second conclusion Phase 1 ( PET 2 , Week 2 ) ; third conclusion Phase 2 ( PET 3 , Week 4 ) fourth conclusion Withdrawal period ( PET 4 , Week 6 ) . Subjects instructed take study drug without food daily approximately time morning throughout course study . Subjects also instruct take concomitant medication consistently time day throughout study .</detailed_description>
