	<brief_summary>Evaluation new resin-based composite material . Amalgam composite commonly use restorative material dentistry . Due toxicity mercury subsequent environmental problem , search alternative continue search new composite restorative material intensifies . The presently available composite improve , shrinkage composite curing procedure still clinical problem . A new composite restorative material among advantage demonstrate low shrinkage laboratory study , due new formulation material . This project aim study clinical performance new composite compare commonly use composite restoration material . 72 patient ( 158 teeth ) allocate project carry School dentistry , University Aarhus , Denmark .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment New Resin-based Composite Filling Material</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project aim study clinical performance new composite restoration material ( Filtek Silorane® ) compare conventional composite restoration material ( Ceram X® ) . Amalgam composite commonly use restorative material , number composite restoration increase past 20 year . Composite restorative material improve considerably year . They almost reach resistance wear amalgam , consequence also use molar restoration . The main reason replace composite restoration fracture caries associate restoration . To reduce risk caries new composite material Filtek Silorane® reduce polymerization shrinkage develop . Extensive laboratory study perform new material , clinical attribute yet disclose . The study carry randomize , double blind , longitudinal study , assessment restoration one year . The project include 72 patient , 158 teeth . Most patient recruit Treatment Planning Clinic dental school Aarhus . After give consent take part study , teeth randomize two treatment group . Multi surface restoration upper low molar premolar perform The treatment procedure : The patient offer local anesthetic treatment start . The cavity excavate filled accord guideline composite restoration . An impression cavity take fill . After treatment bw-radiographs take . The control procedure : The restoration evaluate accord marginal adaptation , cavo surface marginal discoloration , approximal contact , fracture , caries associate restoration postoperative hypersensitivity . The control take place three week one year .</detailed_description>
