	<brief_summary>Most doctor use new drug-eluting stent treatment long coronary narrowing tend cover full length lesion long multiple stent . The investigator hypothesize policy spot-stenting , i.e. , stenting tight part coronary narrowing , might result good outcome mean avoid multiple stent associate significant complication late stent thrombosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spot Drug-Eluting Stenting Long Coronary Stenoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery lesion length independent predictor restenosis follow coronary intervention deployment multiple long bare metal stent associate increase risk adverse clinical outcome . Spot stenting , ie discrete stenting severe stenosis long , diffuse lesion propose alternative clinical setting . The introduction drug-eluting stent result long lesion stented use multiple , overlap DES patient diffusely diseased coronary artery consider safe effective . However , also evidence increase major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) use multiple , overlap DES,10-12 long DES associate increased probability intraprocedural stent thrombosis.13 We hypothesize approach base spot-stenting use DES might result superior clinical outcome compare full cover atheromatic lesion long multiple stent . We therefore conduct randomize comparison spot versus multiple overlap stenting consecutive patient long ( &gt; 20 mm ) lesion indication percutaneous coronary intervention .</detailed_description>
