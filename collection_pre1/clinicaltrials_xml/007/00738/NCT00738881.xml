	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium Erlotinib Hydrochloride Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether difference progression-free survival due treatment erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) compare pemetrexed ( pemetrexed disodium ) subsets previously treat non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient define epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) positive versus negativity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Ascertain presence absence true difference due treatment objective clinical endpoint overall survival , confirm response rate , adverse event profile subset patient defined basis epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -FISH positivity versus negativity . II . Ascertain presence absence true difference due treatment objective clinical endpoint ( i.e. , progression free survival , overall survival , confirm response rate , adverse event profile ) subsets patient defined basis epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression measure immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . III . Ascertain presence absence true difference due treatment objective clinical endpoint ( i.e. , progression free survival , overall survival , confirm response rate , adverse event profile ) subsets patient defined basis epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene mutation status ( MUT ) . IV . To evaluate prognostic effect EGFR copy number measure FISH separately treatment arm , i.e. , difference outcome FISH ( + ) patient receive erlotinib compare FISH ( - ) patient receive erlotinib , similarly difference outcome FISH ( + ) patient receive pemetrexed compare FISH ( - ) patient receive pemetrexed . V. To evaluate prognostic effect EGFR expression measure IHC separately treatment arm , i.e. , difference outcome IHC ( + ) patient receive erlotinib compare IHC ( - ) patient receive erlotinib , similarly difference outcome IHC ( + ) patient receive pemetrexed compare IHC ( - ) patient receive pemetrexed . VI . To evaluate prognostic effect EGFR mutation status separately treatment arm , i.e. , difference outcome MUT ( + ) patient receive erlotinib compare MUT ( - ) patient receive erlotinib , similarly difference outcome MUT ( + ) patient receive pemetrexed compare MUT ( - ) patient receive pemetrexed . VII . To prospectively test hypothesis functionally relevant polymorphism gene encode pemetrexed target , well gene encode one key enzyme involve transport , activation , inactivation pemetrexed , either singly combination , play role efficacy and/or toxicity pemetrexed . VIII . To prospectively test hypothesis functionally relevant polymorphism EGFR gene well gene encode one key enzyme involve metabolism erlotinib , either singly combination , play role efficacy and/or toxicity erlotinib . IX . Evaluate proteomic signature blood sample predictor survival response treatment erlotinib . X . To evaluate expression thymidylate synthase , dihydrofolate reductase , phosphoribosylglycineamide ( GAR ) formyltransferase , methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene expression tumor sample , measure IHC quantitative polymerase chain reaction , predictor survival response treatment pemetrexed . XI . To evaluate proteomic signature blood sample patient predictor response survival treatment erlotinib . XII . To evaluate follow variable measure tumor sample , predictor response survival treatment pemetrexed : Expression thymidylate synthase , dihydrofolate reductase GAR formyltransferase gene methylthioadenosine phosphorylase expression IHC quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . XIII . To evaluate follow variable measure tumor sample , predictor response survival treatment erlotinib : Rat sarcoma ( Ras ) mutational status , EGFR mutational status , epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) status ( measure E-cadherin expression vimentin expression ) IHC . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously ( IV ) 10 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
