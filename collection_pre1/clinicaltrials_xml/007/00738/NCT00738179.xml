	<brief_summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) condition person stop breathe several second time due relaxation throat muscle . This occur many time sleep . It known cause sleepiness poor concentration day . Research indicate OSA may modifiable risk factor cardiovascular disease due association hypertension , stroke , heart attack sudden death . The standard therapy symptomatic OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . CPAP show effectively reduce snore , obstructive episode daytime sleepiness modestly reduce blood pressure risk factor cardiovascular disease . The overall aim SAVE determine CPAP reduce risk heart attack , stroke heart failure people OSA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There increase evidence indicate OSA important modifiable risk factor CV disease include stroke , MI , heart failure . Increased nocturnal arterial blood pressure ( BP ) , hypercoagulability , oxidative stress , inflammation , insulin resistance cardiac arrhythmia associate OSA . These effect presume accelerate progression atheromatous disease , particularly within coronary cerebral vasculature . Moreover , OSA also appear increase risk sudden death sleep , different circadian pattern sudden death without OSA , suggest episode apnea may direct trigger effect cardiac arrhythmia MI . CPAP standard therapy symptomatic OSA , adherence treatment comparable therapy common chronic disease . CPAP eliminate apnea improve daytime sleepiness , mood quality life . Furthermore , short term ( 1-3 month ) randomise control trial CPAP show modest reduction blood pressure ( BP ) marker CV disease , include C-reactive protein ( CRP ) coagulation . However , epidemiological data complicate potential residual confounding factor randomise evidence limit . Thus , direct causal link OSA CV disease remain inconclusive . The management OSA , therefore , remain principally direct towards symptom control rather CV risk modification . The present trial aim test whether long-term use CPAP reduce incidence CV event . If trial show CPAP treatment OSA reduce incidence CV event influence clinical practice toward early detection management OSA , add CPAP range strategy available prevention CV disease .</detailed_description>

Evidence establish coronary cerebrovascular disease evident : Coronary artery disease Previous MI ( equal great 90 day prior ApneaLinkTM assessment ) Stable angina unstable angina ( Clinical event equal great 30 day confirmatory test equal great 7 day prior ApneaLinkTM assessment ) define either ≥70 % diameter stenosis least one major epicardial artery segment , ≥50 % diameter stenosis leave main coronary artery , &gt; 50 % stenosis least two major epicardial artery . ; positive stress test ( ST depression equal great 2 mm positive nuclear perfusion scintigram ) Multivessel percutaneous angioplasty ( PTCA ) and/or stent equal great 90 day prior ApneaLinkTM assessment Multivessel coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) &gt; 1 year prior ApneaLinkTM assessment Cerebrovascular disease Previous stroke ( include definite presumed cerebral ischaemia/infarction intracerebral subarachnoid haemorrhage ) equal great 90 day prior ApneaLinkTM assessment minor disable stroke minimal residual neurological disability ( modify Rankin Score ' 0 = symptom ' ' 1 = No significant disability despite symptom , able carry usual duty activity ' within 7 day stroke onset ) ≥7 day prior ApneaLinkTM assessment . Previous transient ischaemic event ( TIA ) brain retina ( symptoms &lt; 24 hour ) presume vertebrobasilar system ischemia . The TIA diagnosis must confirm suitably qualified clinician ( ≥7 day &lt; 1year prior ApneaLinkTM assessment ) 3 . Patients moderatesevere OSA ( equivalent apnea plus hypopneas index [ AHI ] &gt; 30 per hour sleep ) determine ≥ 4 % oxygen dip rate &gt; 12/ h overnight test use ApneaLinkTM device confirm SAVE core lab Adelaide upon receipt ApneaLinkTM data 4 . Patients able willing give appropriate inform consent Patients exclude entry ANY criterion list meet : 1 . Any condition opinion responsible physician investigator make potential participant unsuitable study . For example , comorbid disease severe disability likelihood death significant memory , perceptual , behavioural disorder neurological deficit ( e.g . limb paresis ) prevent self administration CPAP mask contraindication CPAP use e.g . pneumothorax residence sufficiently remote clinic preclude followup clinic visit 2 .
