	<brief_summary>Subjects thalassemia major require regular transfusion therapy sustain life . The iron present transfuse blood remains body cause variety organ dysfunction . Lifelong iron chelation therapy need maintain iron balance effectiveness varies greatly . Like deferoxamine ( Desferal , DFO ) mainstay chelation therapy 30 year , effectiveness deferasirox ( Exjade , ICL670 ) , newly approve , orally effective iron chelate drug , satisfactory subject . Even good compliance , iron excretion induce give drug exhibit wide subject-to-subject variability . There often persistent iron overload extra hepatic tissue heart pancreas lead cardiac disease diabetes . Combining drug may better approach subject increase risk . The iron balance study propose permit assessment potential combination place subject net negative iron balance relative effectiveness combination relation individual drug , additive effect expect . With information , physicians able design individualize chelation regimen maximize effectiveness minimize side effect adjust ratio and/or dose schedule two drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iron Balance Study Deferasirox , Deferoxamine Combination Both</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involve 34-day hospital stay conduct metabolic iron balance study wherein deferasirox deferoxamine evaluate separately combination , subject serve his/her control . In study currently propose , deferasirox ( 20 , 30 40 mg/kg , administer p.o . 30 minute breakfast ) deferoxamine ( 30 , 40 , 50 60 mg/kg infuse subcutaneously 8 hour night ) evaluate alone combination , drug give sequentially simultaneously wherein deferasirox administer 30 minute begin infusion deferoxamine . In first phase study , combination drug give sequentially , deferasirox 30 minute prior breakfast dose 30 mg/kg deferoxamine night 40 mg/kg . On day 5 - 10 , subject receive first chelation regimen , deferoxamine infuse subcutaneously 8 hour night . They receive daily multivitamin preparation contain 60 -100 mg vitamin C , 1 mg folic acid 400 I.U . vitamin E. On day 15 - 20 , subject give deferasirox 30 minute prior breakfast . Finally , day 25 - 30 , subject receive deferoxamine deferasirox , combination drug give either sequentially ( deferasirox morning deferoxamine night ) simultaneously ( infusion deferoxamine begin 30 minute prior take deferasirox ) . Non-drug day allow clearance stool iron induce previous treatment . A period 4 day choose include normal gastrointestinal transit time individual . A stool marker ( brilliant blue ) administer first last dose drug help quantify fecal iron excretion . Upon admission discharge , subject give complete physical examination various clinical laboratory parameter measure . These include routine blood profile ( complete blood count differential , platelet count ) , serum chemistry profile ( fast blood sugar , total protein , albumin , AST , ALT , BUN , creatinine , bilirubin ( total ) , bilirubin ( direct ) , alkaline phosphatase , uric acid , calcium , phosphorus , magnesium , zinc , copper , sodium , potassium , chloride carbon dioxide ) urinalysis ( protein , beta-2 microglobulin , glucose , ketone , hemoglobin , pH , specific gravity bacteria ; abnormal , microscopic examination RBC , WBC , cast , crystal cell ) . Additional blood test do admission include serum ferritin , serum iron , iron binding capacity , % saturation , vitamin C , serum pregnancy test , hepatitis C antibody HIV-PCR viral load . At begin end study , ophthalmology workup include slit lamp retinal examination , audiogram , electrocardiogram also perform . In addition study conduct upon admission discharge , serial blood test urinalyses do day 6 , 10 , 14 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 26 30 ensure adequate monitoring organ function . Each subject place fixed low-iron diet consist four rotate meal plan design nutritionist consultation subject . Twenty-four hour specimen urine stool collect daily iron content determine atomic absorption . Net excretion determine take account iron content uneaten food . The excretion copper zinc also monitor insure physiologically important metal deplete . Each subject give unit blood day 1 , 11 , 21 34 . This ensure level erythropoiesis approximately drug regimen . In order reduce stress boredom 34-day hospitalization , anticipated subject study pair always someone similar situation interact . They free access television , internet local phone service clinical research unit . The subject must eat breakfast dinner research unit sleep . Otherwise , may go pas day dinner evening shopping , entertainment , etc . We pack lunch choose go day allow consume food drink provide agree upon diet . Visitors allow normal hospital visiting hour .</detailed_description>
