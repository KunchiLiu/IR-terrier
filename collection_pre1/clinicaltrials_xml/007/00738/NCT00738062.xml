	<brief_title>Open-Label Clinical Study Droxidopa Patients With Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension ( NOH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systolic blood pressure transiently minimally decrease healthy individual upon stand . Normal physiologic feedback mechanisms work neurally-mediated pathway maintain stand blood pressure , thus maintain adequate cerebral perfusion . The compensatory mechanisms regulate blood pressure upon stand dysfunctional subject orthostatic hypotension ( OH ) , condition may lead inadequate cerebral perfusion accompany symptom syncope , dizziness lightheadedness , unsteadiness blur impaired vision , among symptom . The autonomic nervous system central role regulation blood pressure . Primary Autonomic Failure manifest variety syndrome . Orthostatic hypotension usual presenting symptom . Primary Autonomic Failure may primary diagnosis , classification include pure autonomic failure ( PAF ) , also call idiopathic orthostatic hypotension ( Bradbury-Eggleston syndrome ) autonomic failure multiple system atrophy ( Shy-Drager syndrome ) also Parkinson 's disease . Regardless primary condition , autonomic dysfunction underlies orthostatic hypotension . Orthostatic hypotension may severely disable condition seriously interfere quality life afflict subject . Currently available therapeutic option provide symptomatic relief subset subject , relatively ineffective often accompany severe side effect limit usefulness . Support garment ( tight-fitting leotard ) may prove useful subject , difficult without family nursing assistance , especially old subject . Midodrine , fludrocortisone , methylphenidate , ephedrine , indomethacin dihydroergotamine among pharmacological intervention use treat orthostatic hypotension , although midodrine specifically approve indication . The limitation currently available therapeutic option , incapacitate nature often progressive downhill course disease , point need improve therapeutic alternative . The current withdrawal design study measure efficacy droxidopa symptom neurogenic orthostatic hypotension patient randomize continued droxidopa treatment versus placebo , follow 14 day double-blind treatment . Droxidopa Droxidopa [ also , know L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine , L-threo-DOPS , L-DOPS ] International non-proprietary name ( INN ) synthetic amino acid precursor norepinephrine ( NE ) , originally develop Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co. , Limited , Japan . It approve use Japan since 1989 . Droxidopa show improve symptom orthostatic hypotension result variety condition include Shy Drager syndrome ( Multiple System Atrophy ) , Pure Autonomic Failure , Parkinson 's disease . There four stereoisomers DOPS ; however , L-threo-enantiomer ( droxidopa ) biologically active . The exact mechanism action droxidopa treatment symptomatic NOH precisely define ; however , NE replenish property concomitant recovery decrease noradrenergic activity consider major importance . Droxidopa market Japan since 1989 . Data clinical study post-marketing surveillance program conduct Japan show commonly report adverse drug reaction droxidopa increase blood pressure , nausea , headache . In clinical study , prevalence severity droxidopa adverse effect appear similar report placebo control arm .</detailed_description>
