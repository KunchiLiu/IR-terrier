	<criteria>Diagnosis nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer , include primary peritoneal fallopian tube malignancy , measurable CT MRI scan assess within 4 week prior study entry Must evidence relapse CA125 ( 2xUpper Limit Normal ) radiographically within 6 month recent platinumcontaining chemotherapy . At least one line chemotherapy must include taxane . Must treat debulking surgery least one line platinumbased chemotherapy ; Subjects may receive four additional line chemotherapy develop platinumresistance . Subjects must candidate repeat paclitaxel treatment Clinical contraindication use paclitaxel , include : 1. persistent Grade 2 great peripheral neuropathy 2. prior hypersensitivity reaction persist despite rechallenge without desensitization result bronchospasm hemodynamic instability least Grade 2 result medication discontinuation Current diagnosis epithelial ovarian tumor low malignant potential ( borderline carcinoma ) . Note : EOC prior diagnosis low malignant potential tumor surgically resect acceptable provide subject Prior radiation therapy exclude exception allowable measurable disease ovarian cancer completely outside radiation portal Known allergic reaction prior monoclonal antibody therapy document human antihuman antibody ( HAHA ) .
