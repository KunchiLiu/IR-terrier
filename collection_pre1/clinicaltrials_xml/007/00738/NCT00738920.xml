	<brief_title>Self Administered Cognitive Behavior Therapy Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) chronic , prevalent , often disable , GI disorder reliable satisfactory medical option full range symptom ( abdominal pain , bowel dysfunction ) . An accumulate body evidence indicate specific psychosocial treatment call cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) associate significant reduction IBS symptom related difficulty . Despite apparent efficacy , CBT 's clinical effectiveness ( i.e. , generalizability , feasibility , cost effectiveness ) adequately establish due partly duration , cost , limited accessibility . As `` second generation '' IBS treatment undergo development validation , become increasingly clear efficacy demonstration necessary sufficient condition treatment viability . In pilot study fund NIDDK 's R03 mechanism , address problem develop briefer , largely self administer version CBT require 4 , 1 hr clinic visit . Our RCT data show 10 session version CBT translate 4 session version without compromise patient acceptability short term efficacy . It unclear whether treatment effect maintain long term ( 12 month ) , due theoretical change mechanism ( vs. nonspecific factor common across different form therapy ) , pronounce among specific subgroup patient , , generalize large sample Rome III diagnose patient treated different investigative site . We seek address question conduct large , definitive , multisite RCT recruit 2 treatment site 480 patient moderate severe IBS ass acute long term response brief ( 4 session ) CBT , extend ( 10 session ) CBT , credible education/support condition . We use first year develop clinical infrastructure ensure success integrity propose trial . In short term , successful trial lend empirical validation self administer version CBT retain efficacy standard CBT transportable , accessible patient outside research protocol , less costly deliver . In long term , hope show self guided behavioral treatment program effective efficient treatment delivery system enhance quality patient care , improve clinical outcome , decrease economic personal cost one prevalent intractable GI disorder .</detailed_description>
