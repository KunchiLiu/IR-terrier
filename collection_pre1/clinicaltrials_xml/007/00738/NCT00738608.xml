	<detailed_description>Depending pain intensity , various analgesic use prevention surgical wound pain . For severe pain , opioids like piritramide morphine use . These give fix interval , continuously , require patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) . The method use depend equipment supervision available patient 's cooperation . However , method administration mention risk respiratory depression strong opioids use . Weak opioids like tramadol give alternative piritramide morphine , combination tramadol metamizol proven effective . Often antiemetic give well , many patient receive combination experience nausea vomiting . For mild pain metamizol nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) often sufficient . As controversy attach use metamizol risk agranulocytosis ( metamizol withdrawn Scandinavian market 1999 ) , hospital use drug . The use NSAIDs likewise problematic . They cause , example , gastric ulcer predispose patient . In set stress accompany surgery , however , even previously unremarkable patient quickly develop stress ulcer . Another problem NSAIDs affect blood clot various extent inhibit platelet aggregation . This aspect particularly crucial early treatment postoperative pain intact blood clot essential . An ideal analgesic postoperative pain would induce respiratory depression affect blood clotting cause gastric ulcer . Because inhibit enzyme cyclooxygenase-1 ( COX-1 ) increase effect gastric mucosa platelet aggregation , analgesic selectively inhibit enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) , mediate inflammatory process . This rationale behind use COX-2 inhibitor treatment acute pain . With selective COX-2-inhibiting analgesic possible inhibit inflammatory process without favor occurrence clot disturbance gastric mucosal lesion . Such analgesic available form etoricoxib , exhibit great COX-2 selectivity coxibs far approve . Etoricoxib mainly use treatment pain associate osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis pain chronic pain ( low back pain ) . However , coxibs also use impressive result treatment acute peri- postoperative pain . Thus , 50 mg preoperative dose rofecoxib significantly decrease postoperative need analgesic also reduce postoperative pain . Etoricoxib exhibit similar property rofecoxib . It already approve treatment acute pain Australia , Latin America ( except Argentina ) , Mexico , Hong Kong , Singapore , Malaysia , Philippines , Thailand , Indonesia . The preoperative use Etoricoxib could provide reliable analgesia postoperative phase potency comparable NSAIDs coxibs without affect blood clotting process favor occurrence gastric ulcer</detailed_description>
