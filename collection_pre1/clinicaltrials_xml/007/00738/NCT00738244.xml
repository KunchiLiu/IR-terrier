	<brief_summary>Wind-noise highly disturb hear impaired individual wear hearing aid wish participate outdoor conversation wind present activity walk run . In situation , wind noise significantly reduce signal-to-noise ratio , consequently , intelligibility speech sound may significantly impair . This negative effect exacerbate use directional microphone scheme hear iads . The objective project determine efficacy MH Acoustics ' multi-microphone wind-noise reduction invention digital hearing aid market . MH Acoustics ' wind noise reduction technology unique since provide instantaneous convergence maintain directionality microphone array . Current commercial technology provide feature . We hypothesize , due design algorithm , speech perception ability sound quality perception well available traditional directional and/or omnidirectional microphone scheme windy environment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two group subject recruit participate : Normal hearing adult adult mild moderately severe hearing loss , age 18-65 . Pure tone audiometrics ( ANSI , 1996 ) do ascertain hear sensitivity 6ooo Hz . Normal hearing define threshold well 20 dB HL ( ANSI , 1996 ) . The exclusion criterion group exhibit hear loss threshold include 3000 Hz exceed 75 dB , minimize inclusion subject `` dead region '' cochlea . Subjects see four visit laboratory . The first visit involve documentation inform consent , measurement hearing threshold . The second , third fourth visit consist test follow measure ( random order subject ) determine various implementation wind noise reduction algorithm 1 ) impact speech perception ability , and/or 2 ) impact sound quality perception . Each session take approximately 1.5 hour , maximum six hour session . The two speech perception test utilized include : 1 ) Connected Speech Test Hearing Noise Test , 2 ) The Hearing Noise Test ( HINT ) ( Nilsson , Soli , &amp; Sullivan , 1994 ; Koch , Nilsson &amp; Soli , 1995 . Overall Impression Sound Quality Ratings Annoyance use subjective , self-reported , measure preference . Overall Impression influence audibility mask effect noise burst , whereas Annoyance rating significantly correlate high frequency emphasis stimulus , potential impact extreme suppression condition ( e.g. , -18 dB ) ( Warner &amp; Bentler , 2002 ; Miedema &amp; Vos , 2003 ) . Both measure analyze function different time constant , gain reduction level , level presentation .</detailed_description>
