	<brief_title>Combination Antiemetic Regimen Prevention PONV Breast Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) one common complication associate surgery . The overall incidence PONV report 25-30 % specific surgery incidence 70-80 % .1-5 Although PONV typically life threatening , patient dread sensation nausea serious effect retch vomit . PONV surgical patient cause wound dehiscence , electrolyte imbalance , increase intraocular pressure , increase intracranial pressure , aspiration , esophageal rupture , loss vision due retinal detachment . 6-11 In several study , investigator find patient rank vomit undesirable common side effect surgery . PONV costly economic term reason day surgery patient must admit hospital overnight stay.12 , 13 It estimate patient experience episode vomit cost additional $ 300 base emesis basin , supply , gown , bedding , additional medication , nursing/physician time.14-20 In general , PONV high woman ( 2-3 time increase risk ) particularly procedures gynecological surgery , laparoscopy , thyroidectomy breast surgery.5 , 21-35 A study Sinclair group find patient undergo breast augmentation experience 8-10 fold high incidence PONV patient undergo type plastic surgery.26 Similar incidence find study 48 % 68 % PONV patient undergo mastectomy , breast reconstruction , implantation.36-40 The hospitalization patient undergo breast cancer surgery significantly decrease 40 % 1993 2003 . Many surgery perform outpatient basis accord Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) , 96 % lumpectomy , 86 % partial mastectomy 22 % complete mastectomy schedule ambulatory surgeries.41 Carroll group find 35 % outpatient suffer nausea vomit leave surgical center.42 Therefore , result problem high incidence nausea vomit specific group patient post discharge nausea vomit ( PDNV ) occur patient home without direct medical oversight . Although still unclear , postulated etiology postoperative nausea vomit central mechanism involve stimulation chemoreceptor trigger zone ( CTZ ) locate bilaterally floor fourth ventricle area postrema . The CTZ sensitive toxin substance blood cerebrospinal fluid . The CTZ also receive sensory signal gastro-intestinal tract . The three major central nervous system ( CNS ) area involve PONV specific emetogenic receptor . Blockade receptor postulate mechanism action commonly use antiemetic . The agent ' antagonist activity may one receptor different bind affinity act different emetic neuroreceptors . The multifactorial etiology PONV involve multiple receptor believe reason one single agent 100 % effective . The administration agent work one receptor type typically reduce PONV incidence 30 % . Use combination antiemetic agent act different receptor site reduce incidence . This combination show great efficacy single agent alone . Although regimen improve outcomes eliminate problem PONV patient need rescue therapy post surgery occur frequently . It would appear reasonable assume use 2 antiemetic would reduce incidence PONV.43 However ; publish evidence great 2 agent scarce . Therefore , main objective proposal study combination antiemetic regimen ( 3 agent vs. 2 agent ) female schedule breast surgery , patient population consider high risk postoperative vomit . The selected agent cover different receptor base hypothesize PONV multifactorial etiology stimulation several factor . It unknown receptor may stimulate stimulus ( anesthetic , surgery , patient factor ) .</detailed_description>
