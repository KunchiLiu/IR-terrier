	<brief_summary>The BioImage Study study characteristic subclinical cardiovascular disease , measure imaging modality , unsupervised circulate biomarker measurement , risk factor predict progression overt clinical cardiovascular disease , diverse , population-based sample 7,300 men ( age 55-80 ) woman ( age 60-80 ) . The socio-demographics study population aim mirror US population whole approximately 69 % cohort white , 12 % African-American , 13 % Hispanic , 4 % Asian , predominantly Chinese descent 2 % ( U.S. Census Bureau : 2000 ) . The cohort recruit Humana Health Plan membership represent three major US market ; Chicago , Illinois , Louisville , Kentucky Southern Florida . Of 7,300 participant , 6,000 characterized respect Framingham risk score various image feature include coronary calcification , carotid intima-media thickness ( IMT ) , presence atherosclerotic plaque , low extremity vascular insufficiency determine ankle brachial index ( ABI ) . Blood sample assay putative biomarkers use variety methodology include unsupervised proteomic metabolomic profiling plasma , RNA expression profile candidate gene analysis genome wide scanning . These approach also combine targeted assay particular analytes . Biological sample bank time collection analyse additional follow case-control validation study . Participants follow identification characterization cardiovascular disease event , include acute myocardial infarction form Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) , stroke ; mortality ; cardiovascular disease intervention . The remain 1,300 subject evaluate follow similar manner except image study conduct . The study conduct use innovative infrastructure method participant recruitment enrollment . Mobile clinic contain image equipment travel three market include study . The mobile clinic configuration allow high level consistency data measurement collect diverse geographic area population . Participants recruit base claim monitor pre-determine eligibility . The baseline examination 7,300 participant occur 12-month period . Based particular finding ( Coronary Artery Calcium ( CAC ) score , Carotid Intima-Media Thickness ( IMT ) , atherosclerotic plaque , Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) , presence Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ( AAA ) , approximately 3,000 participant 6,000 image cohort refer high resolution image modality well characterize arterial disease . This additional imaging also conduct mobile clinic occur 12-month period . Participants contact every 6-months throughout 3-year study ass cardiovascular event , clinical morbidity mortality , obtain additional blood sample .</brief_summary>
