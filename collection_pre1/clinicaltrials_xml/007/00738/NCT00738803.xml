	<brief_title>Restoration Leg Length , Offset , Center Rotation Total Hip Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Leg length inequality follow total hip replacement lead cause patient dissatisfaction subsequent litigation total hip replacement . A change total offset hip ( lateral translation femur relative pelvis ) may also cause significant discomfort hip instability . Before surgery , patient inform leg may lengthen shoe lift may require opposite shoe equalize leg length . Although much less frequent , leg accidentally shorten follow total hip replacement . In one recent study , 62 % patient mean leg lengthen 9 mm one third patient complain lengthen . Limb length inequality occur two reason . First , significant inaccuracy exist current leg length measurement technique . Second , surgeon may deliberately lengthen patient order gain hip stability . Increasing leg length and/or hip offset decrease occurrence bony impingement increase myofascial tension , improve hip stability prevent hip dislocation . Current method determine leg length offset surgery include pre-operative templating , intra-operative measurement , intra-operative x-ray , computer navigate surgery . From pre-operative x-ray , surgeon typically determine size implant best fit patient 's anatomy best recreate leg length . During surgery , surgeon may attempt palpate operative contra-lateral knee and/or ankle estimate leg length . Surgeons may measure length femoral head neck remove length femoral head neck replace . Surgeons may insert long pin pelvis ( typically ilium bone ) measure length pin reference point femur . This pin pelvis method probably consider accurate , leg must reposition exactly position measurement accurate ; 5Â° hip abduction result 8 mm error leg length.3 An intra-operative x-ray show hip also help estimate leg length hip offset . Surgical navigation determine leg length widely availability require significant financial commitment institution . Surgeons typically determine appropriate amount hip offset pre-operative templating . Current leg length guide show even great error attempt measure hip offset . Hypothesis : We aim demonstrate ability accurately measure restore leg length , offset , center rotation total hip replacement new technique use femoral component measurement tool . We plan evaluate clinical outcome procedure compare historical control . Goals : Our primary goal research study accurately measure restore leg length hip replacement . Our second goal accurately measure restore hip offset . Endpoints : Patients evaluate clinic 2 week , 3 month , one year , two year , five year every 5 year afterwards . The leg length , offset center rotation measure pre post-operative x-ray . Questionnaires base validated clinical outcome score complete pre-operative visit , 3 month , one year , two year , five year every 5 year afterwards . Abbreviated Methods : Patients consent enrollment study standard pre-operative post-operative AP pelvic x-ray , leg length , offset measurement , center rotation measurement make two radiograph . In addition , intra-operative fluoroscopic radiograph also obtain . Validated questionnaire ( Harris Hip Scores ) administer pre-operatively , 3 month , one year , two year . The operative technique measure leg length require insert femoral component prior perform femoral neck osteotomy . After femoral component implant , reference guide attach femoral component guide screw ilium fix distance femoral component . The first measurement leg length offset record . The reference guide remove femoral component femoral neck osteotomy perform . The native femoral head remove measure . The acetabulum prepare acetabular component insert . A repeat measurement trial component place allow surgeon additional opportunity accurately recreate leg length offset final component . After final component insert , reference screw removed ilium incision close . All total hip study perform superior approach anterior posterior capsule preserve hip stability maximize . This capsular tissue preservation approach prevent least limit need deliberately lengthen leg order gain hip stability .</detailed_description>
