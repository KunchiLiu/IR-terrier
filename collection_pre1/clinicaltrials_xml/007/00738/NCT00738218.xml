	<brief_title>Diagnostic Accuracy Multi-Detector Spiral Computed Tomography Angiography Using 64 Detectors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The `` Coronary Evaluation Using Multidetector Spiral Computed Tomography Angiography use 64 Detectors '' `` CorE-64 '' study design evaluate diagnostic accuracy multislice spiral CT angiography use 64 detector row identify coronary artery stenosis patient suspect known coronary artery disease . The study design prospective , multi-center , international , blind study examine diagnostic accuracy 64-slice CT comparison CCA . The primary hypothesis study 64-slice CT coronary angiography able detect significant coronary artery disease patient acceptable diagnostic accuracy compare CCA . Significant CAD define â‰¥ 50 % stenosis determine quantitative analysis CCA ( QCA ) . The diagnostic parameter per-patient sensitivity specificity compare CCA , point estimate continuous measurement diagnostic accuracy . Eligible patient first undergo MDCT ( calcium scan MDCTA ) prior clinically indicated conventional coronary angiography . Patients CAC 600 less include primary analysis . Patients follow clinical event include revascularization .</detailed_description>
