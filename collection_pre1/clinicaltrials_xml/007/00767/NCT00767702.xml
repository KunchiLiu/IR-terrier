	<brief_summary>This study explore scientist opinion practice regard use population descriptor ( e.g. , race , ethnicity , ancestry , geography nationality ) describe research study population . It collect genetic researcher opinion , understanding experience study human genetics genetic variation . Scientists principal investigator co-principal investigator n human genetic genomic study common disease least preliminary data us population descriptor may eligible study . Participants ask think study population describe research . They participate two audio-taped semi-structured interview last 90 120 minute . They may also participate one follow optional study component : - A third semi-structured interview explores implement new method describe study population data analysis . - 2 3 day lab observation , member study research team meet lab member , observe daily activity attend lab meeting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The usefulness social political population label , include base race , ethnicity , geographic location , ancestry , nationality , science medicine topic heat debate . The discussion significant define rigorous scientific study design , influence scientist broad society conceptualize , discus , react human difference . Misuse population descriptor genetic genomic research potential perpetuate misinformation , stigmatize certain group simplify complex relationship individual identity , genetics , health . With potential harm mind , National Institutes Health guideline use Office Management Budget category race ethnicity monitor inclusion clinical trial evaluate potential difference safety efficacy intervention question . As increase attention give implication human genetic variation disease health , actively engage scientist may help identify lexicon discuss human genetic variation scientifically sound socially politically meaningful . We aim conduct pilot qualitative study genetic researcher , explore use population descriptor human genetic research , include experiment opportunity describe group study population new way . We use qualitative method capture researcher ' opinion practice think critically use population label study . Understanding individual scientist opinion strengths weakness different classification various context provide important data help define facilitate appropriate use population descriptor human genetic research .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The study population comprise intramural extramural principal investigator : Conducting human genetic genomic research common disease Conducting project use population descriptor describe study sample Have collect , minimum , preliminary data allow complete exploratory exercise reconceptualizing use population descriptor project . Participation limit researcher collect data give sufficient background context meaningfully complete exercise . Insight gather study population alternative exist method population classification description use human genetic research especially useful professional expertise , group would need implement alternative .</criteria>
