	<brief_summary>This study use neuropsychological test look nervous system side effect Cyclosporine ( CsA ) patient aplastic anemia . CsA use part immunosuppressive regimen treat severe aplastic anemia . The drug produce nervous system side effect , tremor , less commonly , insomnia , anxiety , headache , confusion seizure . This study look effect CsA intellectual ability , depression , anxiety , attention , concentration , memory , perception , coordination , think process patient Patients 15 year age old severe aplastic anemia may eligible study : - co-enrolled Clinical Center protocol receive CsA - take CsA 6 month enrol study Participants undergo neuropsychological testing . In addition , provide blood sample clinical data review thing may influence interpretation finding test , result blood test , type medication take , number transfusion require , etc . The procedure follow : Before first dose cyclosporine : - Patients ask prior problem nervous system , prior treatment aplastic anemia ( include transfusion ) , prior infection , current medication . They complete follow set test : - Battery 1 : A set three test measure intellectual ability , level depression ( ) level anxiety ( ) . - Battery 2 : A set seven test measure change central nervous system change affect attention , concentration , memory , perception , coordination , think processing . - Patients provide half teaspoon blood study time blood collect primary treatment protocol . 6 month 12 month start cyclosporine - Patients ask treatment aplastic anemia ( include transfusion ) , infection , change medication occur since start take cyclosporine . They repeat set test Battery 2 . - Patients provide half teaspoon blood study time blood collect primary treatment protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuropsychological Effects Immunosuppressive Treatment Subjects With Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cyclosporine ( CsA ) widely use treatment aplastic anemia well provide immunosuppression transplantation . CsA spectrum neurologic subtle , poorly investigated neuropsychological functional effect . In NHLBI , unique opportunity exist evaluate change neuropsychological function follow CsA large cohort aplastic anemia patient accrue NHLBI treatment protocol . With increased success treat blood disease immunosuppressive therapy stem cell transplantation utilize CsA treatment regimen , patient enjoy prolonged survival quality life become increasingly relevant concern . We therefore propose natural history protocol design evaluate neuropsychological functioning , , CsA administration severe aplastic anemia patient . The primary objective evaluate change attention , language , memory , spatial/motor executive function domains follow CsA therapy use well establish neuropsychological test include Neuropsychological Assessment Battery ( NAB ) Screening Module , Revised Hopkins Verbal Learning Test , Revised Brief Visual-spatial Memory Test , Judgment Line Orientation test , Grooved Pegboard , Trail Making Test two performance subset Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III . IQ test Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence depression/anxiety level screen prior formal testing . Measures also correlate clinical status , standard CsA side effect , CsA drug level relevant biochemical lab value time point control test accuracy explore potential correlation .</detailed_description>
