	<brief_summary>We seek determine whether dual-source compute tomography assessment aortic valve stenosis coronary artery disease equivalent even well conventional invasive coronary angiography transthoracic echocardiography .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Assessment Aortic Valve Stenosis Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until invasive coronary angiography establish assessment symptomatic aortic valve stenosis . Literature show good correlation MSCT , MRI , TTE TEE evaluate severity aortic valve stenosis . The dual-source compute tomography ( DSCT ) capable assess coronary artery high sensitivity specificity term relevant stenosis ( &gt; 50 % ) , due excellent spatial temporal resolution . This study include assessment patient symptomatic valve stenosis . The severity aortic valve stenosis assess DSCT TTE . Significant coronary artery stenosis localisation assess DSCT invasive coronary angiography . We examine correlation DSCT one side either TTE invasive coronary angiography .</detailed_description>
