	<brief_summary>This study determine level virus HIV-infected patient take antiretroviral medication prolong period decrease persists stable level . It also examine whether new gene change ( mutation ) occur drug suppression . HIV-infected patient 18 year age old , enrol another NIH protocol , suppress antiretroviral therapy low level virus blood may eligible 5-year ( ) study . Participants come NIH Clinical Center every 6 month physical examination , routine research blood test leukapheresis collect white blood cell T cell analysis . For leukapheresis , blood collect vein much like donate whole blood , blood direct machine separate extract white cell return rest blood component patient . Patients may also optional third clinic visit year another blood draw .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis HIV-1 Replication During Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination antiretroviral therapy human immunodeficiency virus serotype 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection result profound reduction viremia associate marked improvement morbidity mortality . Therapy curative , however , prolong therapy complicate drug toxicity emergence drug resistance . How drug resistance emerge suppressive antiretroviral therapy remain poorly understood . Investigating characteristic HIV-1 replication suppressive antiretroviral therapy yield important insight understand emergence resistance , require patient suppressed viral RNA level . Prior National Institutes Health ( NIH ) protocols make important observation regard kinetics HIV-1 decline response therapy , level HIV-1 viremia suppressive therapy , nature HIV-1 genetic diversity prior follow initiation antiretroviral therapy . In process , study generate useful cohort patient suppress viral RNA level , extensively characterize virologic immunologic standpoint . Similarly , patient NIH protocols follow prolonged period therapy initiate , also store sample set would useful new study HIV replication . The HIV Drug Resistance Program ( DRP ) study samples protocol 00-I-0110 97-I-0082 develop number new , sensitive laboratory technique measure quantitate genetic variation investigate immune response parameter . To advance understanding HIV-1 replication suppressive antiretroviral therapy emergence drug resistance , propose new protocol study 2 patient cohort ( cite protocol ) select patient protocols new series study . The primary objective protocol investigate virologic immunologic characteristic HIV-infected individual undergo antiretroviral therapy . Upon implementation , new protocol provide human subject protection sample collect two prior protocol , whether patient enroll new study .</detailed_description>
