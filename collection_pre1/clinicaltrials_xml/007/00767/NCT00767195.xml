	<detailed_description>Pulmonary edema cause disorder liquid accumulation lung capillary peri-capillary tissue . This lung disease classify `` Cardiogenic pulmonary edema '' `` Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema '' accord underlying etiology . Cardiogenic pulmonary edema cause dysfunction cardiac pumping capability , lead transudation accumulation pulmonary peri-capillary space . Pulmonary ventilation perfusion mismatch develop shortness breath ensue . The predisposing factor non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema numerous , include severe infection , renal failure , auto-immun reaction , etc . The mortality rate pulmonary edema relatively high , especially non-cardiogenic one . To distinguish type pulmonary edema early stage important treatment . Stethoscopes widely use clinical diagnosis different disease . Lung sound analysis via stethoscope simple diagnostic method lung diseases clinically . Among many kind lung sound , `` crackle '' `` rale '' frequently find pulmonary edema . `` Rale '' also call `` moist rale '' . It consider low-frequency wheeze often see cardiogenic pulmonary edema . On hand , `` crackle '' also call `` dry rale '' , kind high-frequency wheeze usually see Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) classify non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema . By simply listen lung sound , doctor determine whether patient pulmonary edema , whether pulmonary edema present cardiogenic . This listen diagnostic method simple non-invasive . However , accuracy limited factor doctor 's subjectiveness interference physiological signal . Also , sometimes difficult distinguish cardiogenic pulmonary edema non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema auscultation . Advanced diagnostic method ( echocardiography ) often need evaluation lung problem . This propose project intend establish digital diagnostic method pulmonary edema integrate medical expertise resource NTUH ( National Taiwan University Hospital ) engineering ability NCU-EE ( Department Electrical Engineering , National Central University ) computer , electronics , signal processing . We apply developed tool lung sound acquisition hardware system pulmonary edema diagnosis set electronic diagnostic system . The lung sound patient pulmonary edema collect lung sound acquisition hardware system establishment Pulmonary Edema Library . By identify significant spectrum characteristic cardiogenic pulmonary edema non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema , diagnostic system might establish .</detailed_description>
