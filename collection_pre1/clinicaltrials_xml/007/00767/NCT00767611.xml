The primary objective study test hypothesis human PLC zeta activity correlate directly proportion fertilize egg undergo early cleavage vitro fertilization ( IVF ) cycle . Secondary objective study generate preliminary data regard variability sperm PLC zeta activity within individual determine clinical laboratory correlate sperm PLC zeta activity . Study population : The study population consist 178 infertile couple undergo IVF procedure Duke Fertility Center ( DFC ) obtain 154 evaluable couple study . Overall Design : An observational cohort study design use ass association PLC zeta activity residual sperm sample use IVF cycle proportion egg per couple undergo early cleavage cycle . Infertile couple enrol IVF treatment cycle DFC approach inclusion study . Consent obtain male female partner , historical medical information information IVF cycle collect chart review .

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Infertile couple undergo ART cycle DFC egg retrieve female partner . This type ART cycle comprise approximately 8090 percent ART cycle DFC . Infertile couple undergoing ART cycle DFC egg retrieve anonymous egg donor . Approximately 1020 percent ART cycle DFC involve anonymous egg donation . Willing able provide inform consent . Age great equal 18 ( partner couple ) . Essentially infertile couple enter clinical ART program least age 18 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Previous complete participation study . A complete data set obtain either partner couple study . Cancellation ART cycle prior egg retrieval , fertilizable egg retrieve . In case would possible determine primary outcome . Age le 18 ( either partner couple ) . Because rarely experience clinical infertility , expect couple age 18 enter ART program , include subject . Use frozen sperm inseminate egg . The rationale exclusion effect cryopreservation reagent PLC zeta activity unknown , ART cycle DFC utilize donor sperm would able control appropriately confounder .</criteria>
