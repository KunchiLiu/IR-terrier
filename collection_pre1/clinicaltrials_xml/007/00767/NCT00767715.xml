Time baseline remission define primary efficacy measure . Remission define Y-MRS score &lt; =12 AND MADRS-S score &lt; =12 AND CGI-BP = 1 2 . Secondary efficacy assessment include time baseline - Response , define reduction Y-MRS score great equal 50 % compare baseline - Relapse mania , define Y-MRS score &gt; = 16 AND CGI-BP &gt; 2 meet criterion remission - Switch depression , define MADRS-S score &gt; =17 AND fulfil criterion Major Depression self-assessed DSRS .</detailed_description>
