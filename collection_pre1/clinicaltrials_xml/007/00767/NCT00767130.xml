	<brief_summary>Lipitor® , Zocor® , Crestor® statin drug commonly take low cholesterol prevent heart disease . Statins low cholesterol different amount different patient sometimes statins cause muscle pain , cramp , weakness . This study examine genetic difference blood patient take statin predict well statin low cholesterol , whether muscle discomfort occur . Finding genetic connection key develop genetic test might eventually help determine statin best patient . About 1000 people study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Statin efficacy primary secondary prevention cardiovascular disease lead increasingly aggressive usage dosage statin . Their main clinically relevant safety risk statin-induced myopathy ( SIM ) evidence constellation neuromuscular side effect ( NMSE ) include myalgia ( muscle ache , cramp , weakness ) myositis ( monitored elevation serum creatine kinase [ CK ] activity ) . NMSEs disable 3-20 % patient statins , require alteration therapy , reduce compliance . NMSEs vary extent drug patient patient . We develop novel product term SIM PhyzioType™ system provide clinician individualized information patient safe statin drug among atorvastatin , simvastatin , rosuvastatin , 3 prescribed statin . The PhyzioType consist multi-SNP ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) ensemble , interpreted biomathematical algorithm , predict drug response . We develop prototype PhyzioType system incorporate predictive model myalgia , serum CK activity , LDLc reduction atorvastatin simvastatin patient . We recruit obtain 250 patient treated drug use exist clinical record characterize NMSE LDLc response . We use physiogenomic analysis identify SNPs differentiate risk NMSEs among 3 statin combine SIM PhyzioType system . This work also contribute pharmacology SIM unravel new pharmaceutical target . We create validate SIM PhyzioType system clinically useful prediction NMSEs potency 3 statin . In Phase III prospective trial plan FDA approval SIM PhyzioType product .</detailed_description>
