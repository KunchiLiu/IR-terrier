	<brief_summary>Rotavirus infection common pediatric illness lead cause severe acute gastroenteritis ( vomit diarrhea ) infants young child . Since February 2006 , oral vaccine prevent rotavirus approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The company make oral vaccine Merck Company . Since FDA approval , American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommend use oral vaccine infant . A previous rotavirus oral vaccine , Rotashield , remove market concern cause increase gastrointestinal ( GI ) disease call intussusception . However , new rotavirus vaccine study manufacturer find cause increase case intussusception . Intussusception disease portion GI tract fold back leading GI tract obstruction back-up . The manufacturer vaccine note package insert information vaccine study , originally , infant history GI disorder infant surgery abdomen . Currently , information available scientific literature use oral rotavirus vaccine infant GI diseases GI surgery . The objective study assessment safety tolerability oral RotaTeq® vaccine infant participate study . All infant follow clinical adverse event active safety surveillance first 42 day dose also monthly afterward total 12 month first vaccination date . The secondary objective study quantify immunologic response occur infant study . Assessment percentage number infant good immune response ( three-fold rise IgA titer great ) complete rotavirus vaccine series ( three oral vaccine total ) blood test check rotavirus immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) level infant short bowel syndrome compare normal infant occur . Infants , meet eligibility criterion whose parent sign informed consent study information collect . These infant test presence pre-vaccine anti-rotavirus antibody , IgA level , mention . After blood obtain , participant receive first oral rotavirus vaccine dose age 6 week 12 week life per package insert information . This oral rotavirus vaccine may administer routine pediatric vaccine participant primary care provider 's office . The date rotavirus vaccine lot number would record vaccine administration date card . Most participant vaccine give Infectious Disease clinic staff Children 's Hospital Michigan . Subsequent dose oral rotavirus vaccine give minimal interval vaccine four week . The third , final vaccine dose must give 32 week life . Any adverse reaction vaccine report National Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System MedWatch form . Finally , two week participant three oral rotavirus vaccine dos , second final blood draw take place measure post-vaccine level anti-rotavirus antibody , IgA . Participants study monitor telephone contact day 7 , 14 , 42 dose within 48 72 hour dose rotavirus vaccine regard serious adverse event . Each infant also assess clinical set week vaccine dose give . As , parent participant ask fill vaccine report card record child 's temperature , episodes vomit , diarrhea , blood stool fussiness first seven day . The parent also ask record event day 8 42 vaccine administer fever , ear infection , runny nose , etc . Afterward , parent also monthly phone call safety follow-ups 12 month period follow first vaccination . A Data Safety Monitoring Board oversee study 's progress ability vote stop study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Only participant whose parent give full inform consent include study . Infants eligible enrolment study arm diagnosis short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) age 6 12 week age start vaccine series . SBS infant must also afebrile , stable increase weight , stable electrolyte clinically stable home discharge ( already discharge home ) , assess infant 's primary care physician , prior administration oral RotaTeq® vaccine . Study group infant must least 30 cm residual small intestine whole colon intact ileocecal valve least 45 cm residual small intestine ( without whole colon ) without ileocecal valve include study base agerelated normal lengths literature . The SBS infant least 10 day post gastrointestinal surgery time vaccine administration 10 12 week chronological age time first vaccine administration , tolerate least oral intake ( liquids and/or food ) . The vaccine give neonatal intensive care unit purpose study , although risk shed low RotaTeq® vaccine . Infants eligible inclusion control arm underlie chronic gastrointestinal medical condition ( Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) , allow ) age 6 12 week age start vaccine series . Normal control arm infant estimate gestational age agematched within 14 day study arm participant accurate comparison immune response . These healthy infant also receive first vaccine administration 10 12weeks chronological age , possible , immune response group comparable . Infants whose parent give full inform consent meet inclusion criterion exclude participation . Additionally , Infants demonstrate history hypersensitivity vaccine component exclude . Any infant develops symptom associate hypersensitivity reaction first second dose vaccine also exclude study dos . Those infant document fever great 100.5 degree F. severe illness end 12th week life yet receive vaccine exclude . Any infant fails blood obtain third attempt automatically exclude study . Infants history rotavirus history receipt rotavirus vaccine exclude study . Those infant diagnose congenital acquire immunodeficiency neoplasm exclude patient potentially immunosuppressed ( topical inhale corticosteroid use would allow inclusion ) . Infants receive immunoglobulin also exclude ( history receipt blood product allow ) . Short bowel infant diagnose portal hypertension exclude . Also , short bowel syndrome infant list likely need liver/bowel transplantation ( imminent evident liver failure due total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) induce liver injury , total bilirubin level &gt; 7 mg/dl , stage 2 liver fibrosis , two central venous access site remain ) exclude study . In short bowel syndrome infant , principal investigator reserve right exclude infant basis clinical safety concern , specific additional diagnosis , exist develop individual infant may see potential risk factor future adverse event . Those infant household contact immunosuppressive condition , infant reside household immunocompromised person , include individual congenital immunodeficiency , HIV infection , leukemia , lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease , multiple myeloma , generalized malignancy , chronic renal failure , nephritic syndrome , organ bone marrow transplantation , receive immunosuppressive chemotherapy include longterm systemic corticosteroid exclude study . Any infant adequate follow safety telephone home visit exclude study .</criteria>
