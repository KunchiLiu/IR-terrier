	<brief_title>Early Cardiac Computed Tomography ( CT ) In Patients Admitted With Acute Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) kill people UK condition , cause symptom angina ( chest pain ) many . Acute chest pain account approximately 600,000 NHS admission per annum , include many type chest pain due heart problem . Examination , blood test electrocardiogram ( ECG ) use try decide cause chest pain . Many patient low risk CAD discharge without investigation . Others high risk CAD must test invasive coronary angiography . Unfortunately many patient initial test equivocal felt intermediate probability CAD . Investigation symptom group may take place in-patient setting , warrant hospital stay several day , alternatively investigation may perform out-patient subsequent time spend wait list . This result extensive use NHS resource anxiety patient whilst await diagnosis , often needlessly approximately half patient admit acute chest pain eventually discharge without cardiac cause find . The new technique cardiac compute tomography ( CCT ) offer rapid non-invasive diagnosis CAD . If disease detect investigation plan ; exclude , patient may safely discharge . Detection clinically insignificant disease initiate primary preventative strategy exclude CAD cause acute symptom . We randomise 250 patient present Chelsea Westminster Hospital acute chest pain intermediate likelihood CAD early CCT current standard practice . We hypothesise , compare standard practice , early CCT reduce admission length , reduce NHS cost improve quality life without increase adverse event .</detailed_description>
