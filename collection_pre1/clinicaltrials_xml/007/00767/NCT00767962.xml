	<detailed_description>Treatment recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax remain controversial many therapeutic option exist . What best technical option : treatment lung parietal pleura treatment pleura pleural symphysis ? Talc pleurodesis perform medical thoracoscopy resection bleb bulla associate pleural abrasion surgical thoracoscopy ( video-assisted thoracic surgery ) usual method . These two procedure never compare prospective trial . The aim study compare pleural symphysis talc poudrage medical thoracoscopy surgical management combine pleural abrasion bleb bullae resection treatment recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax .</detailed_description>
