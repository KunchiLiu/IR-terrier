	<brief_summary>Girls spina bifida also bladder problem . This need temporary placement tube bladder remove urine . This thin flexible tube call catheter . It increase risk bacteria urine . This turn lead urinary tract infection ( UTI ) . Some girl spina bifida give antibiotic . These medicine use treat infection cause bacteria . The medicine use prevent UTI . However , long-term treatment medicine side effect . For example , bacteria may become resistant antibiotic . Also , bacteria urine persist . UTI still occur patient antibiotic . UTI girls occurs bacteria migrate rectum vagina area . This give bacteria access bladder . Also , girl spina bifida , access bladder easy catheter . Probiotics friendly bacteria . They available dietary supplement food . They contain helpful bacteria . Yogurt example food contain probiotic . The purpose study find , probiotic take 6 month prevent UTI girl spina bifida . We also try find whether change urine bacteria associate take probiotic . A vaginal rectal swab also do find take probiotic benefit prevent bacteria .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In child spina bifida neurogenic bladder dysfunction , need intermittent bladder catheterization increase risk bacteriuria . In many patient , lead clinically significant urinary tract infection ( UTI ) . Many child place long term , low dose antibiotic suppression prevent recurrent urinary infection . Unfortunately , bacteriuria often persist despite daily antibiotic therapy , breakthrough UTIs common . Furthermore , approach carry potential deleterious side effect , may promote development antibiotic-resistant bacteria . UTI girl occur virulent bacteria migrate rectum colonize vagina peri-urethral mucosa , thus gain access bladder . In girls spina bifida , access bladder greatly facilitate catheter passage . Antibiotic prophylaxis relies maintain low dose antibiotic urinary stream , decrease peri-urethral colonization , prevents proliferation bacteria gain access bladder . An alternative approach daily antibiotic prophylaxis decrease risk urinary colonization virulent bacteria supplement normal bacteria flora non-infection causing strain bacteria . Probiotics dietary supplement contain potentially beneficial bacterial strain Lactobacillus . The safety oral administration probiotic demonstrate several study last 30 year . Studies use Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG , probiotic introduce late 1980s alleviate diarrhea , show promising result use UTI prevention . In one study , researcher find subject consume GG drink few episode UTI compare woman receive probiotic . A placebo-controlled study premature infant also use GG attempt prevent UTI . The number urinary infection reduce statistically difference significant . Finally , recent randomize clinical trial demonstrate rate UTI child take prophylactic antibiotic similar patient take Lactobacillus acidophilus alone . The efficacy probiotic usage spina bifida population report . Clinical trial suggest oral ingestion probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 result vaginal colonization prevention adult UTI , potentially inhibit uropathogen ascension vagina urinary tract . A total 60 patient enrol pilot study , half randomize receive probiotic reminder receive placebo [ 1:1 ratio ; 50 % chance group ( A B ) ] . Treatment assignment double blind last 6 month .</detailed_description>
