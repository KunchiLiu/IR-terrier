	<brief_summary>Background : - The effectiveness methadone maintenance treatment heroin addiction well establish . However , patient maintain methadone may relapse cocaine use , even enrol comprehensive treatment program . Relapse attribute several factor , include drug-associated environmental stimulus . - Aripiprazole drug use treat schizophrenia bipolar disorder , may use . Research show aripiprazole reduce cocaine-seeking behavior rat , investigate use treat amphetamine dependence . More research need determine whether aripiprazole prevent relapse cocaine use patient treat methadone . Objectives : - To determine whether aripiprazole prevents relapse cocaine use effectively placebo cocaine-abstinent patient maintain methadone . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 60 year age current cocaine user seek methadone treatment . Design : - The study last 41 week , four phase treatment follow-up evaluation . Three time week , participant ask report illicit drug use provide urine breath sample . Throughout study , participant receive individual counseling weekly 40 60 minute session . Other sample test schedule require study researcher . - Patients stabilized daily methadone first 14 day study . - Weeks 1 14 : Participants receive voucher regular cocaine-free urine sample . Those successfully complete phase continue next part study . - Weeks 13 27 : Participants receive either aripiprazole placebo along methadone . During part study , participant keep electronic diary record cocaine use craving record data mood activity . - Weeks 28 33 : Participants stop take aripiprazole placebo , continue methadone treatment . Participants continue use electronic diary . - Weeks 34 41 : Participants choice transfer community clinic gradually reduce dos methadone end study . - Participants return follow-up visit urine sample 6 month end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background . Though methadone effectively treat opioid dependence polydrug user , abstinent patient relapse maladaptive use cocaine treatment . Relapse may trigger cocaine-associated cue . Work rodent relapse model demonstrate atypical neuroleptic drug aripiprazole ( Abilify ) , partial agonist dopamine D2 receptor , block relapse cocaine use induce cocaine-associated environmental stimulus prim dos cocaine . Scientific goal . To determine whether aripiprazole prevents relapse cocaine use effectively placebo cocaine-abstinent patient maintain methadone . Participant population . A total 275 opioid-dependent outpatient abuse cocaine opioids ( 110 evaluable ) enrol . Target enrollment include 40 % woman 60 % minority ( mostly African-American ) . Experimental design method . The study randomize double-blind clinical trial two treatment group ( 55 per group ) : aripiprazole ( 15 mg oral daily ) placebo . All patient receive standard treatment ( methadone daily individual counseling weekly ) 39 week . To establish abstinence prior aripiprazole induction , contingent voucher give cocaine-negative urine specimen first 12 week ( week 1-12 ) . Participants abstinent cocaine week 11 12 randomized receive aripiprazole aripiprazole placebo week 13 27 ( induction , week 13 14 ; taper , week 27 ) . From week 28-33 , participant receive methadone counseling , offer assistance transfer another program ; transfer undergo 8-week methadone detoxification . The primary outcome measure time relapse long duration cocaine abstinence . Secondary objective include evaluate whether treatment group differ self-reported change drug use proportion drug-negative urine specimen . In addition , drug use , drug craving , stress , HIV-risk behavior injection practice assess via electronic diary ( ecological momentary assessment , EMA ) . Benefits participant and/or society . Participants receive methadone , drug counseling , contingency-management therapy . The methadone , counseling , voucher intervention likely reduce participant use heroin cocaine HIV risk behavior . Aripiprazole may reduce incidence relapse cocaine use . Risks participant . Participants may experience side effect aripiprazole methadone discomfort withdrawal methadone aripiprazole . Methadone could raise serum level aripiprazole via inhibition CYP2D6 metabolic pathway . The EMA component study may generate assessment burden .</detailed_description>
