	<detailed_description>This Geographic Information System ( GIS ) -based retrospective study . Data extract NTUH medical record database , include date notification , sex , birth date , residence address , etc tuberculosis case . Each case geocoded generate spatial coordinate map purpose base street address postal code . To protect privacy patient , personal identification data TB patient , include name ID number , encode . The encoded data file also strictly keep confidential . Disease map usual mean present descriptive geographic data disease occurrence create accurate map disease morbidity mortality . Maps convey instant visual information spatial distribution disease identify subtle pattern may miss tabular presentation . The purpose display variation ill-health ( example , relate underlying sociodemography ) , formulate etiologic hypothesis , aid surveillance detect area high disease incidence , help place specific disease . In detect spatial pattern point geocoded address , point pattern analytical method use . Quadrat Analysis one . This method evaluate case distribution examine density change space . The density measure Quadrat Analysis compare density theoretically construct random pattern see case distribution question cluster dispersed random pattern . Another one Nearest Neighbor Statistic , derive average distance case near neighbor capture information case quadrats . Using ordered neighbor statistic evaluate pattern different spatial scale . A case pattern say cluster observed average distance near neighbor find less random pattern . Ripley 's K statistic extension order neighbor statistic , use depict randomness case distribution different spatial scale capture characteristic local variation . To measure test dispersed/clustered case location respect attribute value , e.g . socioeconomic status , spatial autocorrelation perform . If significant positive spatial autocorrelation exist case distribution , case similar characteristic tend near . For polygon data interval ratio form , tuberculosis incidence different district , Moran 's I index , Geary 's Ratio G-statistic use . Moran 's I use mean attribute 's data value benchmark comparison neighbor value evaluate ; Geary 's Ratio base direct comparison neighbor value ; G-statistic base concept spatial association cross-product statistic capable detect presence hot spot cold spot . In case spatial heterogeneity , i.e . magnitude spatial autocorrelation varies space , modify version previous three statistic use evaluate spatial association local scale .</detailed_description>
