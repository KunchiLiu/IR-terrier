	<brief_title>Investigating Improvement 4D CT Images Using AV Biofeedback</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>JUSTIFICATION Among various site affect cancer , statistic show lung cancer lead cause death among men woman . One major reason treatment lung cancer improve drastically past year . Lung tumor also potentially difficult treat radiation therapy due patient ' respiration motion cause tumor mobile . A1 ) Detrimental effect respiration motion Respiration motion affect tumor site thorax abdomen , although disease prevalence relevance radiotherapy lung cancer . Many study perform study lung-tumor motion method compensate motion radiation treatment imaging , plan delivery . The significance respiration motion compensation technique reduce mobility tumor thereby reduce dose surround normal structure . If motion compensation method use margin must add ensure adequate coverage tumor . Large margin result radiation deliver large volume critical structure . A2 ) Compensation techniques Methods reduce respiration induce intrafraction motion include active breathing control , voluntary breath-hold , deep inspiration breath-hold , respiratory gate technique , 4D tumor-tracking techniques.1-6 Active breathing control deep inspiration breath hold involve patient hold breath . While may improve reproducibility position tumor within lung , feasible patient especially compromised respiratory function . Respiratory gate technique involve turn beam small window respiratory cycle . Thus respiratory gate reduces intrafraction motion totally eliminate . During respiratory gating , since beam turn base respiration signal , treatment time may increase 35-40 % compare regular treatment . Since patient spend time table , could introduce error due patient movement table . 4D tumor track technique share issue discuss follow paragraph . A3 ) During 4D radiotherapy ( 4DRT ) delivery tumor continuously track radiation beam move throughout respiratory cycle . The benefit 4DRT reduction dose healthy lung tissue and/or increase dose tumor . The gain 4DRT clinically measurable , though much development need various step 4DRT i.e . CT image acquisition , plan delivery . During 4D CT image acquisition , image acquire different respiration state normal breathing.7-9 The quality image acquire use 4D CT image acquisition limit patient respiration pattern . Since image sort base patient respiration motion , change pattern could lead image sort different part respiration . This effect reflect artifact CT image . Target volume along respiration motion determine contour target various respiratory state thus obtain volume encompasses entire breathing cycle . The efficacy accuracy 4D CT maximize patient breathe reproducibly . However well-known respiration motion vary one day next also one fraction . A4 ) Effect irregular breathing For 4D CT , minimize variation patient breathe within treatment fraction fraction fraction , i.e. , increase reproducibility patient breathing , important . Large variation patient respiration motion irregular breathe lead artifact CT image show . However , respiration motion amplitude period vary time patient patient various anatomic physiologic factor . A5 ) Possible solution Biofeedback/coaching technique increasingly embed behavioral treatment patient lung disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma , cystic fibrosis . For respiratory gating , several study suggest verbal prompt improve respiration reproducibility . Kini et al.12 conclude audio prompt improve stability respiration frequency patient maintain range respiratory motion , whereas visual prompt control regularity displacement frequency reproducible . Based result Kini et al.12 , combine audio-visual biofeedback devise improve reproducibility respiration motion . Recently Neicu et al.13 described result audio visual prompting demonstrate improvement efficacy so-called synchronized move aperture radiation therapy , use respiratory trace single-patient volunteer session . George et al.14 conclude base 24-patient , multisession study audio-visual biofeedback significantly reduce residual motion variability give duty cycle , thus potentially improve accuracy respiratory-gating . From result study see audio-visual biofeedback reduce motion 0.5 cm ( 0.29 0.24 cm ) exhale breathe 1.5 cm ( 0.46 0.36 cm ) inhale breathing .</detailed_description>
