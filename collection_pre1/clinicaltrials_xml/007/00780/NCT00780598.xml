	<brief_title>Safety Anti-Disease Activity Oral Tosedostat ( CHR-2797 ) Elderly Subjects With Refractory Relapsed AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There urgent need novel compound treatment strategy elderly patient AML , particularly refractory relapse disease effective treatment option . Treatment option elderly patient limit co-morbidity tolerability constraint . Tosedostat new aminopeptidase inhibitor , preclinical experiment show potent activity vitro vivo cancer model single agent . In early clinical study particularly good result observe refractory relapse AML old patient observation form basis current study . This multi-center , open label phase II study enrol approximately 70 subject Part A 130 subject Part B .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION : 1 . Signed , inform consent prior study specific procedure 2 . Subjects confirm diagnosis AML accord WHO classification ( exclude APL ) either first CR lasting le 12 month , first CR receive first salvage therapy study [ 6 ] . For purpose study , follow consideration apply : 1 . Subjects receive 1 induction course , may consist one cycle treatment , different agent dose cycle 2 . Induction course normally consist agent dos consider standard care induction investigational site concern 3 . Subjects may receive consolidation number cycle . Consolidation consider regimen give subject remission 4 . Subjects receive hematopoietic stem cell transplant first remission eligible provide chemotherapy target therapy treat relapse , evidence Graft Versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) . Donor leukocyte infusion allow provided evidence hematologic relapse define International Working Group ( IWG ) [ 12 ] 3 . Subject 's peripheral blast count exceed 30,000/microlitre randomization study . Hydroxyurea treatment leukapheresis may use prior screening period achieve see Section 6.7.2 . 4 . Subject 's life expectancy randomization judge least 3 month 5 . Subjects recover adverse effect prior therapy grade ≤1 ( accord CTCAE v3 ) ( exclude alopecia adverse effect expect chronic stable ) 6 . Subjects must bone marrow aspiration perform within 28 day prior randomization show subject least 5 % blast therefore neither CR CRp . This may do Screening Visit appropriate feasible 7 . Subjects must adequate hepatic renal function include follow : 1 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( absence Gilbert 's syndrome ) 2 . AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal 3 . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal 8 . Age ≥ 60 year 9 . Performance status ≤ 2 ( ECOG scale ) 10 . Screening leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 50 % 11 . Subject able comply study procedure study include visit test 12 . Male subject female partner reproductive potential must use acceptable contraceptive method duration time study continue 3 month end tosedostat treatment Exclusion : 1 . Subjects receive prior therapy first relapse refractory disease ( second induction cycle within single induction regimen allow defined Inclusion criterion 2 ) 2 . Anticancer therapy include chemotherapy , radiotherapy , endocrine therapy , immunotherapy use investigational agent within 2 week prior randomization ( exception hydroxyurea use certain circumstance . Section 6.7.2 ) 3 . Subjects APL ( FAB type M3 ) CML blast crisis 4 . Any prior coexisting medical condition Investigator 's judgment substantially increase risk associate subject 's participation study 5 . Psychiatric disorder alter mental status preclude understand informed consent process and/or completion necessary study procedure 6 . Significant* cardiovascular disease define : 1 . Congestive heart failure NYHA class 4 2 . Unstable angina pectoris 3 . History myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry 4 . Presence clinically significant valvular heart disease 5 . Uncontrolled clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia 6 . Presence clinically significant conduction defect screen ECG 7 . Uncontrolled hypertension ( i.e. , systolic BP &gt; 160mmHg , diastolic &gt; 90 mmHg repeat measurement ) despite adequate therapy 8 . Clinically significant atrial fibrillation *Grade 3/4 CTCAE v3 grade would generally consider clinically significant , although remains judgment Investigator make . 7 . Gastrointestinal disorder may interfere absorption drug 8 . Active serious infection sepsis randomization 9 . Clinically significant interstitial lung disease</criteria>
