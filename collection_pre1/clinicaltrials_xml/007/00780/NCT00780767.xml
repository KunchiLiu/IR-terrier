	<brief_title>Angiojet Rheolytic Thrombectomy Case Massive Pulmonary Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) major cause mortality morbidity society 150.000 death every year US . Usually mortality occur first hour symptom onset ( 11 % ) may increase 17 % 3 month follow-up . In case massive PE ( MPE ) mortality dramatically increase 30 % despite important improvement recently make precocious diagnosis aggressive medical treatment ( i.e . i.v . thrombolysis ) . Quite often ( 40 % ) case PE least one relative fibrinolysis contraindication , less frequently contraindication absolute . In quite rare case , thrombolytic therapy absolutely contraindicate , surgical thrombo-embolectomy advise , however kind challenge surgery available world-wide still remain associated prohibitive high rate mortality . A less invasive alternative remain percutaneous thrombectomy , may divide : - Aspiration thrombectomy , - Fragmentation thrombectomy , - Rheloytic thrombectomy . The first transvenous percutaneous pulmonary embolectomy perform 30 year ago ; however , recently , thanks new developed technology , phyisicians manifest increase interest develop promise less invasive procedure . The angiojet rheolytic thrombectomy ( ART ) catheter ( Angiojet : Possis medical ; Minneapolis , MN , USA ) utilize high velocity saline jet thrombus aspiration , maceration evacuation Bernoulli principle . Nowadays technology successfully utilized daily coronary peripheral artery field ( i.e . thrombus aspiration coronary arterial angioplasty ) . Due safety efficacy , demonstrate randomized trial include patient coronary artery disease , several recent report also confirm usefulness ART also extra-coronary domain ( peripheral arterial venous disease ) . Massive PE , thrombotic coronary artery occlusion , life threaten clinical manifestation , therefore several center begin manage associate mechanical ( i.e.ART ) clot removal pharmacological ( i.e . lysis ) . The first small , retrospective non randomize series suggest safety efficacy technology , confirm feasibility compare actual propose treatment MPE ( i.e . i.v . in-situ pulmonary thrombolysis ) . The first man utilization Angiojet rheolytic thrombectomy treat acute massive PE date 1997 , however in-vitro test also reveal Angiojet able successfully remove thrombus 14 day old , thus enlarge usefulness also sub-acute case ( i.e. &gt; 14 day old thrombus ) . Despite fact indication i.v . fibrinolysis worldwide accept case MPE establish lysis protocol nowadays available , mortality remain unacceptably high ( 30 % ) bleeding relate morbidity major concern . In fact large PE registry , 20 % patient experience major bleeding complication , 3 % case intracranial . Of interest case sub-massive PE ( sub-MPE ) , also associate quite high mortality ( 8 % ) disagreement concern best treatment modality still persist . Several author support intensive treatment modality favourizing systemic i.v . thrombolysis ; however , others suggest conservative attitude ( anticoagulation alone fibrinolysis case clinical deterioration ) . These case sub-MPE may challenge , establish consensus definition sub-MPE combine clinical , radiological cardiological criterion still lack . Furthermore thrombolytic regimen complication-free , suggest , perform i.v . thrombolysis , physician charge patient seriously take consideration absolute relative contra-indications treatment . ( i.e.recent surgery , active peptic ulcer , intra-cerebral bleeding , pregnancy , neoplasm , see Table 1 ) . The ongoing debate improve mortality patient MPE concern correct manage patient sub-MPE suggests case , urgent need improve actual treatment modality .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients age &gt; 18 year old 2 . Patients present MPE ( i.e . hemodynamically unstable moment inclusion ( i.e . shock index ( SI ) &gt; 1 ) . 3 . Patients hemodynamic stability ( SI=1 ) hardly obtain despite increase dose drug support . If 2 hour first medical contact intensive fluid substitution cathecolamine support begin patient remain SI = 1 , he/she could include ART protocol . If initial successful drug support ( fluid + catecholamine ) patient represent second episode hemodynamic instability , he/she could include ART protocol . If patient chronic negative chronotrope medication ( e.g.betablockers ) SI = 1 sufficient include patient study 4 . The MPE confirm thorax CTscan suspect echocardiography ( i.e.visualized thrombus RV main pulmonary trunk RV overload high clinical suspicion MPE ) . 1 .

Patients percutaneous right heart catheterization via common femoral vein contraindicate ( e.g.vascular malformation , inferior cava vein occlusion , presence bilateral iliofemoral thrombosis , RV pulmonary trunk malformation ) . 3 . Patients subMPE without clinical paraclinical sign severity ( e.g . haemodynamically stable = SI &lt; 1 ) . 4 .
