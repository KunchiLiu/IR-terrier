	<detailed_description>Cocaine dependence remain serious problem US today spite two decade intense research , efficacious pharmacotherapeutic treatment identify . Cocaine-associated environmental cue elicit drug craving exposure cocaine-related cue likely involved relapse . Emerging data support role glutamate extinction associative learn animal model rear-conditioning clinical study exposure treatment anxiety disorder . A recent study demonstrate DCS acceleration cocaine-induced conditioned place preference rat ( Botreau et al. , 2006 ) . Exploration DCS facilitate extinction response drug-related cue human need . The propose study extend innovative promising finding basic science arena anxiety disorder field proof concept investigation DCS facilitation extinction response cocaine-related cue human laboratory paradigm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects must able provide inform consent function intellectual level sufficient allow accurate completion assessment instrument . 2 . Subjects must meet DSMIV criterion current cocaine dependence . Subjects may meet criterion abuse , dependence substance within past 60 day exception nicotine . Because high comorbidity cocaine nicotine dependence , exclude nicotine dependence would seriously compromise feasibility recruitment . Nicotine use immediately prior test session control . Alcohol also know affect HPA function ( Adinoff et al. , 1991 ) , however enhance recruitment effort individual alcohol dependence abuse include study require medically supervised detoxification . 3 . Use one follow method birth control female subject : barrier method ( diaphragm condom spermicide ) , surgical sterilization , use intrauterine contraceptive device , complete abstinence sexual intercourse . 4 . Subjects must live within 50mile radius research program reliable transportation . 5 .

Women pregnant , nurse childbearing potential practicing effective mean birth control . 2 . Subjects evidence history significant hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , neurological disease include diabetes , condition may affect heart rate skin conductance measurement . 3 . Individuals creatinine clearance 1.2 great DCS renally excrete . 4 . Subjects history current psychotic disorder , current major depressive disorder , bipolar affective disorder severe anxiety disorder may impact cue reactivity . 5 . Subjects unwilling unable maintain abstinent alcohol drug abuse ( except nicotine ) 24 hour day prior cue procedure . 6 . Subjects meet DSMIV criterion substance dependence ( nicotine cocaine appropriate ) within past 60 day . 7 . Subjects currently take Bblockers , antiarrythmic agent , psychostimulants agent know interfere heart rate skin conductance monitoring . 8 . Known suspected hypersensitivity DCS . 9 .
