	<brief_summary>On regular ( diagnostic ) MRI image brain tumor show `` contrast enhancement '' : uptake intravenously administer contrast agent cause enhancement pattern see white area frequently use MRI protocol ( `` T1 weight image '' ) . High grade glioma common brain tumor share enhancement pattern . The goal surgery resect contrast enhance part without cause additional neurological damage . Intraoperative MRI ( iMRI ) helpful tool achieve goal , provide updated image resection correct deformation occur brain surgery . These deformation make preoperative image use standard neuronavigation system less reliable . However , due manipulation surgery , contrast uptake surgery may differ contrast uptake diagnostic MRI . This study aim relate contrast enhancement iMRI tumor characteristic tissue sample tumor . When neurosurgeon considers resection high grade glioma complete , iMRI scan make , tissue sample perform borderzones tumor tumor resection cavity respectively . This provide insight relation contrast enhancement iMRI presence tumor tissue . Such knowledge important improve effectiveness safety iMRI guide brain tumor resection .</brief_summary>
