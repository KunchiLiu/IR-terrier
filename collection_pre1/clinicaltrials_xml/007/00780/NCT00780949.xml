	<brief_title>Immunological Consequences CARD15/NOD2 Mutations Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) affect 60.000 80.000 people France . It characterise chronic relapse inflammation gut . Its aetiology largely unknown , limit development preventive curative therapeutic option . In 2001 , identify first CD susceptibility gene : CARD15/NOD2 . This gene involved innate immune response know today gene mutation may induce disease lesion . However , many data suggest intestinal inflammation may relate abnormal function lymphoid tissue present gut . The aim present proposal well understand role CARD15/NOD2 mutation ( R702W , G908R 1007fs ) development function intestinal lymphoid tissue . 250 patient control enrol Robert Debré Saint Louis Hospital ( Paris , France ) within 2 year period . For participant , 4 5 ileal biopsy take routine colonoscopy . Patients class three group accord number CARD15/NOD2 mutation ( 1 ) wild-type , 2 ) mutate heterozygotes 3 ) mutate homozygote compound heterozygote ) . A comparison group non inflammatory ( colonoscopy perform reason ) inflammatory ( ulcerative colitis patient ) control do . For group , cell phenotype , cytokine profile , permeability bacterial translocation analyse Peyer 's patch . The project base adult paediatric cohort among large one Paris locate Saint Louis Robert Debré hospital . Experiments perform INSERM Unit U843 collaboration department immunology statistic , Robert Debré Hospital .</detailed_description>
