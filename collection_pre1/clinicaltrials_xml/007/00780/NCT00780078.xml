	<brief_summary>Patients fail extubation stay significantly longer intensive care unit ( ICU ) high mortality rate , intubate successfully . Reintubation associate life-threatening complication poor prognosis . Functional respiratory test frequently use wean parameter , however , accurate enough predict extubation failure . The incidence swallow dysfunction underestimate , mainly among patient whose intubation last longer 48 h.We previously observe assessment swallow function oropharyngeal motricity , conduct physiotherapist extubation could helpful make decision extubate patient intubate 6 day . The objective study validate scale previously devise use physiotherapist bedside evaluation swallow function oropharyngeal motricity , among patient intubate 6 day , determine whether scale good predictor airway secretion-related extubation failure.Expected result : validate scale previously devise call `` physiotherapist evaluation swallow function oropharyngeal motricity extubation '' mean multicentric study . In hypothesis clinical parameter study could predictive extubation failure . Then , evaluation could help medical decision choice good time extubation . The final objective low mortality relate extubation failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Patients selection , inclusion procedure : All successive patient admit medical surgical ICU , intubate orotracheal route &gt; 6 day , prospectively enrolled extubation decide . Patients previous swallow disorder , ENT surgery chronic persistent vegetative status include . All patient fulfill usual criterion extubation . Then , extubation , different component swallow function evaluate trained physiotherapist , use bedside pre-extubation scale base 3 test : assessment 1 ) - cervical , oral , labial lingual motricity ; 2 ) - gag reflex ; 3 ) - swallowing . After extubation , ability cough swallow , secretion volume , need suction evaluate immediately , 24 , 48 72 hour . - Expected result : validate scale previously devise call `` physiotherapist evaluation swallow function oropharyngeal motricity extubation '' mean multicentric study . In hypothesis clinical parameter study could predictive extubation failure . Then , evaluation could help medical decision choice good time extubation . The final objective low mortality relate extubation failure .</detailed_description>
