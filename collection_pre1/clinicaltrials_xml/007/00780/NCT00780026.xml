	<brief_summary>The goal propose study evaluate effectiveness intraoperative , strict glycemic control improve survival infection rate follow liver transplantation randomize , prospective trial.Primary objective : To determine strict intraoperative blood glucose control , compare standard intraoperative glycemic control , improve 1-year recipient survival decrease surgical complication , include infection , follow liver transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Glucose Control Liver Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 2.1 million patient United States acquire infection medical care every year . For example , 9 % -30 % patient undergo surgery acquire nosocomial infection , increase mortality morbidity expect normally expect increase cost care several billion dollar . Studies show control high blood glucose level dramatically improve recovery critically ill patient surgery , notably decrease risk infection . The advantage strict glycemic control critically ill patient well accept , Institute Healthcare Improvement Surviving Sepsis Campaign set glycemic control part post-operative sepsis management bundle . Few study investigate role strict glycemic control surgery . Liver transplantation good model study glucose control hyperglycemia almost always occur incidence infection high surgical procedure . We perform retrospective review 184 consecutive adult liver recipient intra-operative blood glucose level measure treated insulin . Recipients strict glycemic control compare poor control difference donor recipient demographic , intra-operative blood glucose concentration , intra-operative insulin administer , immunosuppression , post-operative complication , mortality . Poor glycemic control associate significantly increase rate infection first 30 day post-operatively ( 48 % vs. 33 % , P=0.05 ) 1-year mortality significantly increase recipient poor intra-operative glucose control ( 21.9 % vs. 8.8 % ; P = 0.05 ) . These data along post-operative study , suggest post-transplant mortality rate may potentially decrease nearly 50 % 1 year underscore need confirm prospective trial . The goal study prospectively evaluate outcome liver transplant recipient either strict glucose control ( goal 80-110 mg/dl ) current standard care ( goal 180 200 mg/dl ) . The specific aim study determine strict intra-operative blood glucose control , improve 1-year recipient survival decrease surgical complication , include infection , follow liver transplantation . The rate infection 30 day surgery health one year post- surgery compare . The frequency common post-operation complication also study . The propose study potential impact intra-operative management liver transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
