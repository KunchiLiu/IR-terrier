	<brief_title>Physiotherapy Treatment Patients Suffering From Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Denmark 1000 new case head neck cancer every year . The number increase . The treatment head neck cancer either surgery radiotherapy treatment combination modality .

Radiotherapy induce damage skin , lymphatic system , cartilage bone often lead symptom trismus , lymphoedema , decrease range motion mouth , neck tongue , difficulty use mimic muscle , difficulty swallow pain . The severity late side effect due radiotherapy treatment head neck cancer often leave patient poor quality life rating . Effects physiotherapy intervention scarcely investigate . Only study describe effect physiotherapy treatment . The study difficult compare insufficiently describe physiotherapy intervention , variation onset extent physiotherapy intervention plus variation study population . No study describe long term effect physiotherapy intervention . There national international consensus physiotherapy treatment patient undergoing treatment head neck cancer . Primary hypothesis : Decreased mouth open patient suffer c.cavi oris c.oropharynges undergo radiotherapy treatment , reduce early physiotherapy effort compare present circumstance . Secondary hypothesis : The extent late side effect radiotherapy treatment head neck cancer reduce early individually adjust physiotherapy treatment . Guided physiotherapy training/treatment positive effect patient self estimate symptom extent health relate quality af life . The hypothesis study build study literature clinical experience treatment late side effect patient suffer breast cancer uterus cancer , also suffer lymphoedema fibrosis due radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
