	<brief_summary>Alcohol drug use among youth costly community . More research need best support community base prevention program community prevention expertise inform research process . The National Institute Drug Abuse fund 5 year collaboration RAND Corporation , Search Institute training division , Vision Training Associates , Communities Children Youth , University Southern Maine implement ass impact prevention coalition , combination two complimentary , community-based intervention : Developmental Assets , support community mobilization collaboration promote positive youth development , Getting To Outcomes ( GTO ) , enhance community capacity complete critical prevention task ( e.g. , evaluation ) . The purpose project investigate : 1 ) How well Assets-GTO intervention deliver , much use , coalition think ; 2 ) The extent Assets-GTO approach enhance prevention capacity ( knowledge , attitude , skill ) individual coalition member quality prevention performance ; 3 ) Whether enhance prevention capacity improve alcohol drug outcome among youth . Twelve community-based prevention coalition Maine ( part Communities Children Youth ) participate . Six coalitions—determined random—will receive manual , training , on-site technical assistance consist bi-Weekly meeting A-GTO 4 ME ! key coalition staff . The six coalition continue practice usual , receive abbreviate version Assets-GTO intervention near end project . A Community Research Workgroup make coalition representative review aspect study interim finding facilitate dissemination A-GTO 4 ME ! The project demonstrate evaluate strategy strengthen prevention capacity community organization use broadly across many type program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Prevention Capacity With Developmental Assets Getting Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol drug ( AOD ) use problematic many community . Despite spread evidence-based prevention , community still face difficulty achieve outcome demonstrate prevention science . This `` gap '' resource limit , prevention complex , community often lack capacity adapt implement `` shelf '' program . Also , many evidence-based program aim improve deficit -- despite evidence show need also promote positive youth development community-wide effort . Common way bridge gap , information dissemination , fail change practice outcomes local level part sufficiently address capacity use community input . Therefore , build community 's prevention capacity , great collaboration scientist practitioner , focus positive youth development , method could improve quality prevention outcomes . This project assess combination two model specifically design foster approach : Getting To Outcomes ( GTO ) Developmental Assets . They complimentary : GTO enhance local capacity discrete prevention task ( e.g. , evaluation ) ; Developmental Assets support community mobilization collaboration promote positive youth development . Combining content , tool , resource two SAMHSA ( Best Practice ) prevention planning process potential improve quality prevention program accountability either would alone . Quasi - experimental case study Assets GTO demonstrated feasibility community setting yield evidence suggest model help community mobilize improve prevention practice outcomes . As next step , propose randomize controlled efficacy trial element effectiveness study ( i.e. , implementation community-based setting ) compare 6 AOD prevention coalition use Assets-GTO 6 similar coalition . Such blended design emphasize generalizability external validity recommend community-based research . We use participatory research approach Workgroup coalition representative actively involved phase research . Assets-GTO 's impact prevention capacity assess program level ( 5 per coalition ) staff interview individual level Coalition Survey ( 54 member ) . A survey school coalition operate assess impact AOD use positive developmental outcome among program ' target population . Organizational change theory guide Assets-GTO implementation ; standardize measure track Assets-GTO adoption . Results implication ensure prevention program find effective research trial successfully deliver real world setting , priority NIDA NIAAA . Project Narrative The demonstration evaluation Assets-Getting To Outcomes system prevention alcohol drug ( AOD ) use outline proposal direct relevance public health . This AOD use among youth significant health problem face US community . The Assets-Getting To Outcomes system design help community engage AOD prevention work well plan , implement , self-evaluate prevention strategy order help achieve positive result , thereby positively impact mortality morbidity youth local level . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE : The demonstration evaluation Assets-Getting Outcomes system prevention alcohol drug ( AOD ) use outline proposal direct relevance public health . This AOD use among youth significant health problem face US community . The Assets-Getting To Outcomes system design help community engage AOD prevention work well plan , implement , self-evaluate prevention strategy order help achieve positive result , thereby positively impact mortality morbidity youth local level .</detailed_description>
