	<brief_title>Effect Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Treatment Inflammation Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) characterise repetitive episode upper airway obstruction sleep . Systemic airway inflammation recently show associated OSA hypothesize contribute clinical manifestation complication OSA patient . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) first-line treatment OSA improve diurnal nocturnal symptom . However , effectiveness CPAP reverse airway inflammation less compelling comparison systemic inflammation . This study assess NO exhale breath , inflammatory biomarkers induce sputum blood OSA patient clinical measurement 3 month CPAP treatment .</detailed_description>
