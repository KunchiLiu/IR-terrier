	<brief_summary>The purpose study : To determine cost-effectiveness treat NLDO use immediate office probing compare deferred probe facility set . As part primary objective , study determine proportion eye experience spontaneous resolution among subject randomize deferred probe group . The secondary objective : 1 . To determine success proportion eye undergo immediate office probe initial procedure . 2 . To determine success proportion eye undergo deferred facility probe initial procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immediate Office Probing v Deferred Facility Probing Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction Children 6 &lt; 10 Months Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasolacrimal duct obstruction ( NLDO ) common ocular condition first year life . Many case resolve spontaneously massage . Many study primary treatment NLDO report , however case series largely retrospective , uncontrolled , conduct single center . The substantial uncertainty regard estimate spontaneous resolution primary reason conduct current study . Probing widely-used initial treatment NLDO infancy . Our group recently complete prospective observational study find 78 % success proportion probe among child age 6 &lt; 12 month . Other estimate success rate probe vary 69 % 92 % . Two differ approach nasolacrimal probe often use : ( 1 ) immediate office probing ( early probe - generally soon 6 month age ) ( 2 ) medical management ( episodic antibiotic eye drop massage lacrimal sac ) 9-13 month age follow probe general anesthesia conscious sedation ( deferred probing ) . The advantage early probe avoidance general anesthesia conscious sedation , immediate resolution symptom , few physician visit , few antibiotic prescription , less cost per procedure , possible prevention fibrosis inflammation nasolacrimal duct . The advantage defer probe include subject comfort procedure possible avoidance surgical procedure completely . The optimal approach management NLDO first year life remain uncertain . Our prospective observational data suggest slightly reduce chance success immediate office probing ( 75 % office probing , 80 % facility probe ) , however , immediate office probing may cost-effective even proportion success lower . For subject undergoing single operation , immediate office probe less expensive deferred probe facility fee anesthesia , facility , medication prescribe pre-operative observation period . Some portion low cost would offset however additional cost second procedure initial office probe successful . Deferred facility probe expensive per procedure ; however , overall cost reduce number child whose NLDO spontaneously resolve wait perform procedure facility . The study randomize clinical trial aim determine cost-effectiveness treat NLDO use immediate office probing compare deferred probe facility set . As part primary objective , study determine proportion eye experience spontaneous resolution among subject randomize deferred probe group .</detailed_description>
