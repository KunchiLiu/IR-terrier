	<brief_summary>Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitors become common analgesic treatment option patient arthritis . However , long-term treatment associate increase cardiovascular risk . With past withdrawal rejection approval COX-2 inhibitor treatment option limit . This translate example 10 million osteoarthritis patient US receive COX-2 inhibitor concomitant hypertension . And exemplify unmet medical need develop offer safe treatment option particular patient population . This trial investigate pharmacodynamic aspect CG100649 develop novel COX-2 inhibitor . Preclinical data show dual mechanism action , consist inhibition two enzymes COX-2 carbonic anhydrase-I/-II ( CA-I/II ) cardiovascular risk COX-2 inhibition might attenuate .</brief_summary>
