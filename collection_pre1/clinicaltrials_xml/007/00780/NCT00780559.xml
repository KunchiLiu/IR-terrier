	<brief_title>Improving Neuropathy Mobility People With Early Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuropathy common complication diabetes mellitus . Impaired glucose regulation ( IGR ) associate development peripheral neuropathy couple gait mobility impairment may disable patient . Recent novel data investigator ' group indicate improve diet exercise significantly improve even reverse neuropathy associate IGR , however test specific intervention control diabetes complication trial . IGR include patient early type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) base standardized criterion diagnosis T2DM . The investigator hypothesize , compare IGR participant advise follow current standard care recommendation diet exercise ( Standard Care `` SC '' ) , IGR participant undergo Tailored Diet Physical Activity ( TDPA ) enhancement program show great improvement 6 minute walk test ( 6MW ) show great reduction marker neuropathy progression e.g . intraepidermal nerve fiber density ( IEFND ) . Furthermore , investigator test hypothesis improvement measure neuropathy , mobility function physical activity ( PA ) correlate strongly improvement specific measure metabolic function , weight loss . This proposal permit u determine TDPA improve mobility induce nerve regeneration subject early diabetes .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>IGR time screen within three month screen . This definition include patient impaired fast glucose ( IFG ) , impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , early diabetes . Patients include increase risk diabetes HBA1C &gt; = 5.7 % ( use method certify National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program ) , diabetes HBA1C &gt; equal 6.5 % , abnormal fast venous glucose , abnormal venous glucose value follow 75 gram oral load . Glucose value define ( mg/dl ) : IFG fast great 100 mg/dl , IGT fast less 126 , 2 h 140199 , diabetes fast glucose &gt; 126 , 2 h &gt; 200 base Standards Medical Care Diabetes 2010 American Diabetes Association . The HbA1c may normal , must &lt; 8 % . If diabetic subject medication , stable medication least 3 month prior enter study . Addition change antidiabetic medication enrollment affect participation group assignment . No risk factor cause neuropathy ( determined medical history , family history , history medication , occupational history , history exposure toxins , physical neurological examination , laboratory study ) . Clinical sign symptom neuropathy determine treat neurologist history physical exam , plus abnormality one following : nerve conduction study ( NCS ) , Quantitative Sudomotor Autonomic Reflex Testing ( QSART ) , Quantitative Sensory Testing ( QST ) , IENFD . Age range 30 80 year inclusive time screen Medically stable time enrollment . Able participate standing exercise program without constant standby monitoring . Women childbearing potential must use acceptable method contraception prevent pregnancy enrol study must agree continue practice acceptable method contraception duration participation study . Patient must agree take alternative medication coumadin undergo skin biopsy Willing complete weekly selfreport questionnaire . Willing accept assignment either train group . Willing able increase activity level exercise independently home . Pregnant woman , prisoner , institutionalized subject risk subject include study . Taking insulin . Etiology sensorimotor neuropathy IGR base careful clinical laboratory evaluation . Current severe medical condition active day enrollment would affect patient 's ability complete study . This may include active advanced current ischemic heart disease ( e.g. , angina congestive heart failure ) , permanent residual low extremity weakness loss balance result stroke , active severe obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease , ongoing cancer treatment , renal failure currently require dialysis , severe ongoing peripheral vascular disease . An inability understand cooperate procedure trial refusal sign inform consent . Patients unable answer question correctly Evaluation Sign Consent ( ESC ) tool . Significant neurologic , rheumatological , neuromuscular , extremity condition limit safe exercise weight bearing .</criteria>
