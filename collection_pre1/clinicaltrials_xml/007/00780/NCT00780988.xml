	<brief_summary>Current therapy metastatic colorectal cancer prolong life approximately 2 year . A innovative therapy prolongs life significantly even cure need . Bone marrow transplantation curative therapy patient leukemias lymphoma . Tumor eradication case transplantation patient 's marrow ( autologous transplantation ) base intensive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy use conditioning . Tumor eradication case transplantation use marrow normal donor base tumor reduction condition immune elimination tumor cell T cell donor transplant recognize foreign tissue antigen express tumor cell kill cell . The use bone marrow transplantation treat tumor leukemia lymphoma limit , study transplantation patient 's marrow treatment advance /metastatic breast cancer conclusively show benefit beyond conventional therapy . Recently , Strober lab develop preclinical model effectively treat colon cancer mouse combine immunotherapy autologous bone marrow transplantation order markedly augment anti-tumor potency immunotherapy . They use CT26 colon cancer therapeutic target either single subcutaneous tumor nodule , disseminate tumor lung peritoneum , metastatic tumor liver depend route administration tumor cell BALB/c mouse . Mice vaccinate mouse establish primary tumor disseminated/ metastatic disease irradiate tumor cell mixed adjuvant CpG , find vaccination alone effect tumor growth . Similarly radiation condition tumor bearing host follow transplantation bone marrow spleen cell purify T cell hematopoietic stem cell unvaccinated donor strain effect . In contrast , radiation conditioning mouse follow transplantation hematopoietic immune cell donor strain vaccinated tumor cell CpG cure almost subcutaneous primary well disseminate metastatic tumor host . A similar result obtain autologous transplantation hematopoietic immune cell tumor bearing mouse vaccinate tumor establishment . Investigation tumor infiltrate cell show injected donor T cell accumulate tumor unless host irradiate injection . Based model , assemble team Stanford University faculty member expertise gastrointestinal cancer , immunotherapy , radiation oncology , bone marrow transplantation Departments Medicine Pathology translate preclinical finding Phase I safety feasibility clinical study treatment 10 patient metastatic colorectal cancer . Resected tumor cell irradiate mixed CpG create vaccine . Patients receive subcutaneous vaccination week 1 2 resection . Six week later , immune T cell G-CSF `` mobilize '' purify blood progenitor cell harvest blood cryopreserved . If need patient receive chemotherapy tumor reduction . When disease control chemotherapy , patient receive condition regimen fludarabine ( 30mg/m2 daily x 3 day ) follow intensive fractionate total body irradiation . The dose fTBI escalate use 3+3 design ensure safety range 400 800 gray . The patient undergo hematopoietic immune cell rescue . They undergo third vaccination within 7-14 day transplant . Thereafter , serial monitoring tumor burden continue . Immune monitor occur vaccination well transplantation . Tests include vitro anti-tumor immune response T cell ( proliferation , cytotoxicity , cytokine secretion etc . ) stimulation whole tumor cell tumor cell lysates pulse antigen present cell , anti-tumor antibody response , immune reconstitution transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Autologous Tumor Cell-TLR9 Agonist Vaccination Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As third common cancer incidence second mortality , colorectal cancer ( CRC ) significantly impact live many Americans.1 In 2008 , estimate 148,810 case diagnose 49,960 patient die disease . Approximately 20 % patient present metastatic disease diagnosis . The introduction effective chemotherapy regimens biologically target agent last year lead considerable improvement treatment option metastatic CRC yet median survival approximate 2 year . Resection primary tumor clinically indicate followed combination oxaliplatin irinotecan intravenous oral 5-FU , leucovorin , bevacizumab first-line therapy metastatic CRC standard care . In 2004 , Goldberg colleague establish FOLFOX4 standard care chemotherapy regimen metastatic CRC demonstrate superiority two old regimen , IFL ( bolus 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan ) IROX ( irinotecan/oxaliplatin ) , term prolong median overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , increase response.2 FOLFOX4 increase median survival time 19.5 month compare 15 month 17.4 month IFL IROX respectively ( p= .0001 ; HR .66 , 95 % CI 0.54-0.82 ) . Time progression also significantly increase 8.7 month compare 6.9 6.5 month ( p=.0014 ) . Furthermore FOLFOX-4 effect 45 % overall response rate compare 31 % ( p=.002 ) 35 % ( p=.03 ) IFL IROX respectively . It also induce significantly less associated grade ; 3 nausea , vomit , diarrhea , febrile neutropenia , dehydration two regimen . Hoping improve regimen , capecitabine , oral pro-drug 5-FU , introduce . It significant advantage infusional 5-FU include ease administration oral formulation , lack infusion-related toxicity , decrease duration hospitalization clinic time . Multiple trial pit capecitabine-based therapy infusional 5-FU regimen show comparable efficacy.3-8 Overall toxicity profile also comparable two regimen exception less myelosuppression hand-foot syndrome capecitabine compare infusional-5-FU-based regimen . Thus , clinical practice , CAPOX ( capecitabine-oxaliplatin ) largely consider comparable regimen FOLFOX , significantly convenient administration . The addition target therapy inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) endothelial growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) 5-FU/LV regimen increase survival . Bevacizumab , monoclonal antibody VEGF , approve metastatic CRC 2004 pivotal phase III trial , AVF2107g , show significant improvement OS 15.6 month 20.3 month ( HR death , 0.66 , p &lt; 0.001 ) addition bevacizumab IFL.9 PFS response also significantly increase 6.2 month 10.6 month ( p &lt; 0.001 ) 34.8 % 44.8 % ( p= 0.004 ) respectively . The first phase III trial evaluate combination bevacizumab oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy ( FOLFOX-4 CAPOX ) , NO16966 , demonstrate addition bevacizumab improve PFS 1.4 month ( 9.4 vs. 8.0 month , HR 0.83 , p=.0023 ) overall response rate similar.10 Median OS also increase 19.9 month placebo group 21.3 month bevacizumab arm statistically significant ( HR 0.89 , p=.077 ) . Cetuximab , mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody EGFR , also show promise metastatic CRC.11 , 12 The BOND trial , multicenter randomize phase II trial show significant double response rate 2.6 month increase PFS combination irinotecan-cetuximab cetuximab alone second line setting , difference median OS.11 These result lead FDA approve cetuximab February 2004 second-line treatment either monotherapy tolerate irinotecan combination irinotecan response irinotecan alone . The CRYSTAL trial , phase III multicenter randomize trial also demonstrate cetuximab hold promise first line setting.13 In trial ( n=1217 ) , addition cetuximab FOLFIRI significantly increase response rate 6 % ( 46.9 % vs. 38.7 % , p=0.005 ) PFS 1.9 month ( p=0.036 ) . Trials evaluate first line use cetuximab oxaliplatin-based regimen appear promise ongoing.14 , 15 When use cetuximab , presence K-RAS mutation must consider . Activating mutation K-RAS gene present 40-45 % colorectal cancer patients.16 The presence mutation correlate bad outcome lack response cetuximab patient advance chemotherapy-refractory CRC.17 , 18 Even new agent improve combination , median survival metastatic CRC patient remain less 2 year less 5 % survive 5 years.19 Furthermore , one expect 20 % patient progress within 4-6 months.10 Better regimens treatment greatly need impact pervasive fatal disease .</detailed_description>
