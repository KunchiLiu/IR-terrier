	<brief_summary>Rationale : Despite spontaneous cardiac activity recovery , shock occurs half patient resuscitation cardiac arrest . This acute circulatory insufficiency present similar characteristic septic shock responsible early death . Most frequently , usual treatment unable control shock avoid appearance multiple organ failure . Aim study : In addition conventional therapeutic , early plasma epuration inflammatory mediator ( HDHP ) could able improve hemodynamic parameter reduce shock duration . This improvement could impact multiple organ dysfunction also early mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Efficiency Hemodialysis Treatment With High Permeability Post-resuscitation Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HDHP ( plasma epuration inflammatory mediator ) use addition current clinical practice . The experimental arm treat HDHP device . The high permeability membrane SepteX membrane polyarylethersulfone sell Gambro allow purification molecule average size near 50 kd molecular weight . We thus purify molecule large molecular weight hemofiltration usual membrane ( 30 kd ) . Furthermore , increase permeability allow significant treatment medium-sized molecule diffusion ( hemodialysis ) , usual membrane allow . Finally , possible purify certain molecule hemofiltration include high volume allow ( TNFalpha example ) . Use membrane require use specific set dedicate machine Prismaflex specific software ( Exceed ) ensure control security processing . 2 session HDHP perform first 48 hour follow ICU admission ( inclusion first 8 hour ) .</detailed_description>
