	<brief_title>Novel Noninvasive Techniques Study Neutrophil Airway Inflammation Ozone Challenge Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental ozone exposure human subject know induce transient neutrophilic airway inflammation sputum neutrophilia elevate concentration inflammatory mediator bronchoalveolar lavage sputum supernatant . In study , ozone concentration 250 ppb inhale three hour ozone challenge chamber . In recent study , ozone challenge discuss model pulmonary disease dominate neutrophilic inflammation COPD , provide possibility test new anti-inflammatory substance early stage clinical development .</detailed_description>
