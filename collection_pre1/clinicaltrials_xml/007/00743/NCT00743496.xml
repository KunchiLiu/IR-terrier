For study test use new experimental ( investigational ) antibody call hu14.18K322A . GD2 express surface tumor type . Two schedule hu14.18K322A antibody evaluate study , ( 1 ) daily four consecutive day schedule every 28 day ( 2 ) weekly 4 week schedule every 28 day . Approximately 25-40 participant require define maximum tolerate dose schedule . Participants continue treatment maximum 4 8 course one criterion off-treatment met .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial Of The Humanized Anti-GD2 Antibody In Children And Adolescents With Neuroblastoma , Osteosarcoma , Ewing Sarcoma Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SJGD2 Phase I dose find study . The primary purpose phase I study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity humanize monoclonal anti-GD2 antibody , hu14.18K322A , research participant refractory relapse neuroblastoma melanoma ( Parts A B ) osteosarcoma Ewing sarcoma ( Part C ) . Initially , Part A , one research participant treat low dose level hu14.18K322A antibody [ 2 mg/m^2 daily 4 consecutive day every 28 day ( 1 course ) ] , toxicity observe next participant treat next dose level . This continue first instance biological activity ( form grade 2 side effect ) observe point traditional phase I study design follow . A maximum 4 course may give . Part B : Hu14.18K322A antibody administer intravenously ( IV ) start dose 50 mg/m^2/dose weekly 4 dos per course . One course consider 28 day . A maximum 8 course may give . Part C : Hu14.18K322A antibody administer 6 patient refractory/recurrent osteosarcoma maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 60 mg/m^2 daily 4 consecutive day every 28 day ( Part C1 ) . A cohort patient refractory/recurrent osteosarcoma Ewing sarcoma also administer hu14.18K322A antibody start dose 40 mg/m^2/dose weekly 4 dos per course ( Part C2 ) . Participants continue treatment maximum 8 course . Secondary objective include : 1 . Estimate response rate , within confines phase I study , humanize anti-GD2 antibody , hu14.18K322A . 2 . Evaluate pharmacokinetics hu14.18K322A . 3 . Examine whether human anti-human antibody ( HAHA ) develop participant receive hu14.18K322A . 4 . Assess tolerability hu14.18K322A MTD daily x4 weekly dose patient refractory recurrent osteosarcoma .</detailed_description>
