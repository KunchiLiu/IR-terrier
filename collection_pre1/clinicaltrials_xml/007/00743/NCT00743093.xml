	<brief_summary>The objective study monitor liver function test ( blood level indicator liver function ) healthy people take maximum labeled daily dose acetaminophen compare people take placebo 16 40 day . Those people continue normal liver test 16 day complete part study . People develop abnormal liver function test continue take acetaminophen placebo , liver test monitor closely additional 24 day . This ( 1 ) make sure test return normal ( 2 ) determine test return normal still take acetaminophen placebo . If time liver test indicate anything minor increase , would immediately tell stop take study drug . Secondary objective determine proportion subject detectable acetaminophen-protein adduct daily dosing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acetaminophen use common many consumer take 4g/day longer 4 day . The use 4g/day acetaminophen 4 day cause asymptomatic ALT elevation people . This elevation likely resolve continue treatment , possible individual may go develop clinical liver injury . By carefully follow healthy subject take maximal daily dose acetaminophen , safely determine ALT elevation resolve progress clinical liver injury . If subject develop clinical liver injury intervene irreversible injury occurs .</detailed_description>
