	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability , Antiviral Activity 24 48 Weeks GS-9190 Combination With Peginterferon Alfa 2a Ribavirin Treatment Genotype-1 Chronic HCV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety , tolerability antiviral efficacy GS-9190 , administer orally twice daily 40 mg , compare placebo use combination peginterferon alfa 2a ( PEG ) ribavirin ( RIBA ) treatment-naïve subject chronically infect HCV genotype 1 infection . Two-hundred forty-eight ( 248 ) subject randomize ( ratio : 1:2:1 ) one three treatment arm : Arm 1 : PEG/RIBA + placebo BID 48 week + 24 week treatment-free follow-up ( n = 62 ) Arm 2 : PEG/RIBA + GS 9190 40 mg BID 48 week + 24 week treatment-free follow-up ( n = 124 ) Arm 3 : PEG/RIBA + GS 9190 40 mg BID 48 week + 24 week treatment-free follow-up . However , subject achieve RVR ( HCV RNA undetectable Week 4 ) maintain response Week 24 stop study drug Week 24 follow additional 48 week ( n = 62 ) . Randomization stratify plasma HCV RNA level ( &lt; ≥ 400,000 IU/mL ) screen race ( African descent ) . In order ensure adequate representation subject genotypes 1a 1b trial , enrollment either genotype cap 120 subject . Once 120 subject either genotype ( e.g. , genotype 1a ) randomize , subsequent enrollment allow subject genotype ( e.g. , genotype 1b ) . The duration double-blind treatment 48 week plus 24 week treatment-free follow-up ; however subject Arm 3 stop medication Week 24 achieve RVR ( define undetectable HCV RNA follow 4 week therapy ) maintain response thereafter . Subjects learn randomize Arm 3 , Week 24 , achieve criterion stop therapy , instruct stop . All subject remain blinded treatment status throughout course study . The standard care treatment stop criterion use clinical practice treat HCV PEG/RIBA , failure achieve EVR , utilized trial . Additionally , subject detectable plasma HCV RNA Week 24 discontinue study medication later Week 28 visit follow off-treatment 24 week .</detailed_description>
