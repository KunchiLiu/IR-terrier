	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure , single-photon emission compute tomography compute tomography lymphoscintigraphy , may help low dose radiation therapy surgery , help prevent lymphedema . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study single-photon emission compute tomography compute tomography lymphoscintigraphy follow intensity-modulated radiation therapy see well work treat patient undergone surgery stage I stage II breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess feasibility integrate Philips Precedence SPECT/CT® image GE PET/CT Fusion software reduce radiation dosimetry deliver lymph node drain arm patient surgery stage I II breast cancer . - To examine difference radiation dosimetry patient use 3-D conformal radiotherapy v without Philips Precedence SPECT/CT® . - To compare reduction lymph node radiation dosimetry patient use single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) compute tomography ( CT ) 3-D conformal radiotherapy v intensity-modulated radiotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive filtered technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid ( TcSC ) intradermally undergo single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) compute tomography ( CT ) imaging time TcSC 2 hour injection . Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy whole breast , include low axilla lymph node identify Phillips Precedence SPECT/CT® dose determine computer analysis image information . Patients complete lymphedema screen questionnaire baseline 12 24 month treatment .</detailed_description>
