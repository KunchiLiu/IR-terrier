	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effectiveness standard medical therapy versus usual care woman chest pain , coronary endothelial dysfunction unblock coronary artery . Coronary endothelial dysfunction ( CED ) condition layer cell around heart function properly believe key factor development atherosclerosis ( fat deposit artery ) . In addition , CED associate increase risk future cardiovascular event , heart attack stroke . A coronary angiogram allows physician see artery heart block , usually fatty plaque . In many instance , angiogram woman experience chest pain show evidence coronary disease ( free significant plaque build-up ) . Currently , standard care treatment plan patient normal coronary artery , despite symptom chest pain , result patient may receive medical treatment . However , woman often return physician chest pain go similar battery test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endothelial function test perform woman without significant coronary disease order help identify woman may likely develop coronary artery disease ( CAD ) would benefit aggressive lifestyle ( dietary counseling , exercise ) medical ( treatment aspirin cholesterol blood pressure lower medication ) intervention .</detailed_description>
