	<brief_title>Feasibility Study : Effect Patient Decision Aids Total Joint Replacement Surgical Referrals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Current research priority manage wait time total joint arthroplasty ( TJA ) indicate need establish benchmark consider patient preference . Among clinically appropriate candidate procedure , patient ' preference surgery low ; 8.5 14.9 % clinically ideal candidate definitely willing consider TJA.However , patient ' preference hip knee replacement strongly associate misperceptions indication , risk benefit , procedure . These misperceptions correct use patient decision aid . Therefore , patient decision aid may role ensure wait list reform address under-use surgical procedure inform patient need want , prevent over-use procedure inform patient value . If use combination screen surgical eligibility , might also prevent inappropriate referral surgery ( i.e. , patient clinically eligible would want surgery even clinically eligible ) . Objective : To pilot test feasibility trial evaluate incremental effect patient decision aid reduce unnecessary surgical referral TJA , use combination general practitioner intake clinic screen patient surgical eligibility . Participants &amp; Setting : Patients refer surgical consultation hip knee osteoarthritis The Ottawa Hospital recruit . Excluded inflammatory arthritis , previous TJA , unable understand video/DVD decision aid due deafness , blindness , cognitive impairment , language barrier . Design : In pilot study , patient screen surgical eligibility train general practitioner use standardized examination hip/knee questionnaire assess joint symptom disability . Eligible patient stratify affected joint ( hip/knee ) randomly allocate either : ) usual education ; b ) patient decision aid present balance evidence-based information treatment option , include risk benefit . Automated report send surgeon patient . Primary Outcomes : - Feasibility participant recruitment , intervention provision , data collection ; sample size need detect difference rate unnecessary referral Secondary Outcomes - Proportion unnecessary surgical referral . - Decision quality , extent patient ' decision inform values-based . - Perception Preparation Decision Making . Timeline Deliverables : By end one year study , prepare report policy brief evidence feasibility support large scale multi-centre trial fully implementable set intervention , standardize training , facilitate replication elsewhere .</detailed_description>
