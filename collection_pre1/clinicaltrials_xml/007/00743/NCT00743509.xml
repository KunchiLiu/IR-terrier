	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Oral Cyclophosphamide Sirolimus ( OCR ) Advanced Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose Phase II study ask participate ass effectiveness combination oral cyclophosphamide sirolimus sarcoma patient relapse widespread disease cure surgery , radiation conventional chemotherapy . Malignant connective tissue tumor soft tissue bone ( sarcoma ) highly aggressive cancer . There available chemotherapy treatment active treat sarcoma . Sarcomas metastasize ( spread throughout body ) usually fatal . There great need identify new active drug treat metastatic relapse sarcoma . Low dose oral daily cyclophosphamide establish chemotherapy regimen treatment malignant autoimmune disease generally well tolerate . Sirolimus approve prevention kidney rejection transplantation . Temsirolimus , form sirolimus , approve treatment kidney cancer . Sirolimus combine cyclophosphamide animal model sarcoma result significant anti-tumor activity . Tumor blood sample study look know protein target medication help learn certain subject favorable response treatment .</detailed_description>
