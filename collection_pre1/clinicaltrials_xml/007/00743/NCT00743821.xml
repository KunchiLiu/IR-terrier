	<brief_title>Eye-Tracking Rapid Attention Computation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal project development military-ready , sensitive rapid eye track diagnostic device individual mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . The device also test efficacy diagnose fatigue identify age effect . We use predictive visual tracking paradigm dynamically capture attentional state correlate subject 's performance degree disruption attention network cause mTBI , age fatigue . The device test diagnostic capability base selectivity , reliability , sensitivity validity individual vary age ( without mTBI ) military personnel undergone 26 hour sleep deprivation . Testing conduct two site : 1 . Civilians mTBI ; civilian adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder test trained staff Brain Trauma Foundation ( BTF ) Weill Cornell Medical College ( WCMC ) New York City . The age enrol individual range 18-55 year order examine age effect . 2 . Enrolled service member test United States Army Research Institute Environmental Medicine ( USARIEM ) Natick , Massachusetts . These service member healthy volunteer without history mTBI . Some subject undergo 26 hour sleep deprivation test specific time point . Our objective : 1 . Prove eye-tracking concept bring successful laboratory device specific , reliable , selective , valid diagnostic tool . 1.1 . Test reliability examine test-retest reliability measure EYE-TRAC ; 1.2 . Test selectivity test ability differentiate effect fatigue , age , mTBI EYE-TRAC measure ; 1.3 . Test validity determine relationship measure attention work memory base EYE-TRAC validated measure sustain attention work memory ; 1.4 . Test specificity measure spectrum TBI injury use MRI-DTI correlate EYE-TRAC .</detailed_description>
