	<detailed_description>[ F-18 ] RGD-K5 investigate diagnostic radiopharmaceutical detection localization angiogenesis tissue lesion support application role integrins anti-angiogenic therapy benefit patient cancer inflammatory disease . The primary objective exploratory study : - To gain information biodistribution [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 , evaluate PET image [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 resolution , signal background ratio detection localization angiogenesis tissue . This Exploratory Investigational New Drug ( EIND ) study design obtain preliminary imaging fundamental biodistribution , metabolism safety information demonstrate early proof concept . The information collect study use diagnostic purpose , ass subject 's response therapy , clinical management subject .</detailed_description>
