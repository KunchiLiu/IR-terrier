	<brief_summary>To date , laparoscopic approach may apply several gynecologic disease . Among recent advance laparoscopy important role assume method tissue extraction . In particular electronic power morcellators become instrument large use surgical practice . The tissue morcellator endoscopic instrument indicate cutting , core extract tissue operative laparoscopy , pivotal role specific gynaecologic procedure well myomectomy hysterectomy . The main advantage offer electronic morcellator consist reduction operative time risk hernia formation , last due absence fascia 's tear stretching . Recently , new generation tissue morcellator commercialize . In particular , GYNECARE MORCELLEX ( Ethicon-Johnson &amp; Johnson Gateway , US ) ROTOCUT G1 ( Karl Storz , Culver City , CA , US ) two tissue morcellators currently available . These instrument seem offer advantage previous model term precision , speed durability . The useful feature seem high speed , particular calculate morcellate tissue approximately four time faster previous generation . The high speed characterize new morcellator potentially result reduce operative time consequent benefit surgical outcome postoperative pain recovery time . Even morcellator seem high-quality instrument , study design compare two tool prospective fashion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) Comparing GYNAECARE MORCELLEX Versus ROTOCUT GI Tissue Morcellators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients symptomatic uterine leiomyoma assess eligibility enrol present protocol-study . At entry , woman age , parity , body mass index ( BMI ) , menopausal , socioeconomic work status , symptom relate gynecologic disease , previous major surgical laparotomy , associate medical condition assess . All eligible patient randomize single block use central computer generate randomization list ( University Catanzaro ) . The subject assign one four subgroup surgical treatment , i.e . group A1 myomectomies perform use GYNECARE MORCELLEX , group A2 supracervical hysterectomy perform use GYNECARE MORCELLEX , group B1 myomectomies perform use ROTOCUT G1 group B2 supracervical hysterectomy perform use ROTOCUT G1 . Before surgery , patient gynaecological rectal examination , Papanicolau smear test , ultrasonographic hysteroscopic assessment endometrial biopsy perform . For surgical intervention follow parameter record : duration surgical procedure , intra-operative blood loss , amount blood transfusion , intra-operative complication , number laparotomic conversion , postoperative pain , post-operative complication , hospital stay , time return full activity and/or work . Data analyze use intention-to-treat principle P value 0.05 less consider significant .</detailed_description>
