	<brief_summary>The study conduct patient undergo surgical aortic valve replacement cardiopulmonary bypass . Following surgical access native aortic valve prior removal valve , native valve dilate use standard valve dilation balloon . The Heart Leaflet Technologies ( HLT- Heart Leaflet Technologies Inc. ) aortic valve device release native valve measurement take device relative anatomic structure heart . Once complete , implant remove native valve surgical valve replacement procedure complete . The purpose study confirm dimension HLT valve appropriate patient aortic valve stenosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aortic valve stenosis disease leaflets aortic valve become scar calcified . This lead severe narrow valve orifice , cause chest pain , heart failure eventually death . The condition currently treat open chest surgical valve replacement cardiopulmonary bypass . Heart Leaflet Technologies develop aortic valve prosthesis deliver stenotic aortic valve catheter insert femoral artery . The purpose study confirm dimension HLT valve appropriate patient aortic valve stenosis . There animal model aortic valve stenosis . Heart Leaflet Technologies perform extensive device geometry deployment test fix cadaveric heart calcify cusps aortic stenosis . HLT also perform number preclinical animal experiment verify deliverability device function vivo .</detailed_description>
