	<brief_title>Temperature Changes During Induction General Anesthesia Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some anesthesiologist cover pediatric patient blanket induction general anesthesia , others . Complaints raise pediatric surgeon pediatric patient cover induction general anesthesia , child 's core body temperature lower normal follow surgery recovery room . Children risk significant heat loss operating room due multiple factor , , exposure cold temperature , decrease metabolism follow induction general anesthesia , increase surface-area-to-volume ratio , considerable respiratory heat loss.1 A decrease temperature 0.5ºC 1.5ºC occur induction general anesthesia pediatric patients2 . The use heat blanket warmer may increase temperature result constant temperature pediatric patient intra-operatively3 . We want investigate difference temperature two approach , cover cover pediatric patient , induction general anesthesia urologic procedure caudal block difference temperature post-operatively . We hypothesize core temperature : 1. cover warm group induction general anesthesia great 0.5ºC uncovered group induction general anesthesia . 2. group , cover uncovered , equal surgery post-operatively . In word , due active warming procedure surgery post-operatively PICU , core temperature uncover group catch cover group .</detailed_description>
