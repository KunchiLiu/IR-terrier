	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) long-term degenerative joint disease disable 10 % people age 60 compromise quality life 20 million Americans . A procedure call total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , affect surface knee joint replace plastic metal , successful restore comfort mobility formerly arthritic joint . This study compare quadriceps muscle strength , knee range motion , pain people traditional TKA minimally invasive TKA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Minimally Invasive Total Knee Replacement Improving Rehabilitation Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 400,000 TKAs perform year United States alleviate pain disability associate knee OA . Although procedure reliably reduce pain improves function people knee OA , recovery strength quadriceps muscle normal level rare . For year TKA , performance walk physically demand activity , stair climbing , also significantly low people TKA healthy adult age . Within past year , less invasive TKA surgical technique develop promise alternative traditional TKA . Minimally invasive TKA , TKA ( min ) , achieve surgical objective , possibly without much damage quadriceps muscle see traditional TKA . No study , however , specifically investigate TKA ( min ) might preserve quadriceps muscle function . This study determine whether TKA ( min ) good TKA improve quadriceps muscle force production activation , increase knee range motion , reduce post-operative pain improve overall functional outcome . Participants schedule undergo knee replacement surgery randomly assign receive either traditional TKA TKA ( min ) . Prior surgery , participant attend 30-minute orientation session undergo certain test evaluate knee function . Functional test include time walking , stair climbing , balance testing , knee flexibility measurement . Other evaluation include thigh muscle strength activation testing , use brief electrical pulse determine muscle contract much possible , health status questionnaire . After operation , participant instruct use walking aid , walker , crutch , cane , period time . Participants attend study visit repeat test 48 hour follow surgery ; Months 1 , 3 , 6 ; Years 1 2 .</detailed_description>
