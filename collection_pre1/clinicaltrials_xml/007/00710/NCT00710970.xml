	<brief_summary>The major objective two-stage phase II study determine whether tamoxifen deserve study metastatic bladder cancer . Tamoxifen expect function cytostatic ( cytotoxic ) agent , may produce disease stability regression . Sustained stable disease consider clinically important likely event . Hence , 4-month freedom progression choose primary end-point instead response rate . Freedom progression define period start therapy time objective radiologic progression . A total 25 subject enrol , 15 stage 1 10 stage 2 two-stage minimax design phase II study . Pre-therapy evaluation ( within 3 week initiation therapy ) : - History physical examination ( H P ) - Performance status ( PS ) assessment - CBC ( complete blood count ) - CMP ( complete metabolic profile ) - Pregnancy test ( woman younger 50 ) - Computed tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen pelvis - Bone scan bone pain raise alkaline phosphatase - Biopsy ( may use previous biopsy specimen ) - Samples plasma routine CBC CMP bank indefinitely future biomarker study Scott Department Urology . Treatment plan : Therapy administer outpatient . Tamoxifen administer 20 mg/day single daily oral dose . Clinical assessment patient history physical examination perform every 4 week ( one cycle ) . Objective radiological assessment response make every 8 week earlier clinically indicate . A CT ( computerized tomography ) scan abdomen , pelvis chest perform baseline every 2 cycle . A response confirm repeat scan 4 week . Bone scan perform patient complain new bone pain raise alkaline phosphatase . A radiologist blind treatment regimen read scan . The RECIST criterion use define response . Tamoxifen continue progressive disease intolerable side effect occur .</brief_summary>
