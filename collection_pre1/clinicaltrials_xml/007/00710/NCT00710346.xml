	<brief_title>Establishment Fibroid Tissue Bank</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long term goal protocol create repository well-characterized fibroid ( leiomyoma ) tissue order gather information lead improve understanding uterine fibroid growth pathogenesis . It expect initiative eventually improve fertility reproductive health million woman suffer fibroid . To address need increase research field , NICHD collaboration Office Research Women Health ( ORWH ) establish national fibroid tissue bank . This initiative strengthen science base , improve understand uterine fibroid develop grow , provide clue effective conservative management fibroid . The rationale protocol repository well-characterized , well-preserved leiomyoma tissue provide investigator interested basic translational research fibroid opportunity study condition . This facilitate research experiment conduct sample may expect improve understand mechanism pathophysiology disease .</detailed_description>
