	<brief_summary>Diets share principle : eat le energy need . This result weight loss . However , weight loss usually combination loss body fat muscle mass . Additionally , one 's bone may begin weaken , albeit slowly , diet , could serious long-term consequence . Thus , investigator believe goal weight loss strategy lose body fat spare muscle . The investigator reason two-fold . 1 ) Fat store skin , also around internal organ . When occurs , organ may function properly . Losing fat mass good thing health standpoint , since fat storage site extra energy . Scientists show 'extra ' body fat actually secrete substance substance get blood , cause many problem may even contribute development diabetes . 2 ) Sparing muscle individual lose weight important . Muscle 'metabolically active ' tissue , analogy , like body 's furnace . Muscle burn fuel food individual eat also store fuel , like fat . Hence , 's easy see n't want lose muscle 'd lose one body 's best fat burner . More importantly , muscle also big storage site furnace blood sugar . In people diabetes ( elevate blood sugar ) , big part problem muscle - simply take store burn enough sugar . For reason , goal lose fat preserve muscle diet . There many different diet choose ( e.g . high protein , low carbohydrate , high fat , high fiber , etc. ) . A diet show quite successful , however , one high protein ( excessive ) . Thus , study , investigator propose test whether high protein ( dairy ) calcium diet promote body fat loss muscle mass retention . The investigator believe diet high protein ( emphasis dairy ) , still within accept healthy range , high dietary calcium may result great loss body fat retention muscle diet conventional amount protein adequate calcium conventional amount protein little calcium ( i.e . low dairy ) . Based previous research , investigator think people low calcium intake begin would stand benefit . There also good reason think high protein/high calcium diet may result great reduction blood cholesterol blood sugar , would reduce person 's risk heart disease diabetes . The investigator test diet premenopausal woman overweight obese . The investigator believe group good one target several reason . First , woman age overweight obese , continue carry excess weight , serious risk develop chronic disease heart disease , diabetes , possibly cancer early age . Second , woman often begin gradually consume less dairy many perceive dairy food fatten . Thus , investigator proposal correct investigator hopefully able equip health professional try test , palatable , dietary strategy population segment , age , would benefit greatly disease risk reduce .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>`` Improving Diet , Exercise And Lifestyle ( IDEAL ) Women '' Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight obese female subject , habitually low dairy consumer age 19-45 year recruit McMaster University student staff population surround Hamilton area . At study entry , subject ask complete standard screen questionnaire document medical history , current medication use , physical activity level , smoke habit , alcohol consumption . Subjects also complete calcium food frequency questionnaire . Before randomization study commencement , baseline measure do . These include : anthropometrics , fast blood sample , fast urine sample , rest energy expenditure measure ( REE ) , muscle adipose biopsy , cardiovascular measure ( blood pressure , heart rate , blood vessel stiffness arterial elasticity ) body composition ( dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [ DXA ] ) , 7-day baseline food record analysis . Also , subject ' strength fitness assess ( 1 repetition maximum ( RM ) submaximal Astrand Test evaluation ) . During study , fast blood sample also take week 4 , 8 , 12 16 , DXA also do week 8 16 , validate Body Image questionnaires fill week 8 16 , body weight record every week . All measure repeat 16 week ( 1RM , Astrand Test , biopsy , cardiovascular measure , REE ) . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) carry small portion subject voluntary basis week 0 16 . Apon completion baseline testing , subject randomly assign one three intervention group . Part intervention form 2 daily chocolate drink ( post-exercise drink plus one extra drink per day ) . Drink composition differ depend group subject randomize . Drinks make look taste similar . In term daily diet , DairyPro ( middle/second ) group employ macronutrient distribution Control ( first ) group half protein derive dairy source , subject ask consume , top supplemental chocolate drink , 2 yogurt ( 100 g ) . In control group , protein derive source dairy . In HiDairyPro ( third ) group , dietary protein manipulate comprise twice much dietary energy versus two group ( i.e. , 30 % energy intake versus 15 % ) . Protein ( half daily requirement ) derive dairy protein ask subject consume , top supplemental chocolate drink , 1 serving ( 250 ml ) 1 % regular milk , 4 yogurt ( 100 g ) 2 piece cheese ( 21 g ) . Overview supplemental drink composition diet composition group : 1 . Control ( Con ) - group consume twice daily drink contain dairy protein calcium . Daily protein ( 15 % total kcals ) non-dairy source ( i.e . meat , egg , fish , chicken , lentil , bean , wheat gluten ) . 2 . Dairy Protein Group ( DairyPro ) - group consume twice daily drink contain 1 % chocolate milk least half daily protein ( 15 % total kcals ) intake dairy source . 3 . High Dairy Protein Group ( HiDairyPro ) - group consume twice daily drink contain 1 % artificially sweeten chocolate milk along diet formulate contain 30 % ( opposed 15 % Con DairyPro group ) dietary energy protein least half come dairy protein . Subjects meet study dietitian/nutritionist begin biweekly throughout 16 week , provide individual dietary counseling reduce daily calorie 500 kcal/d . Subjects provide template diet record , nutrition information sheet macronutrient specific exchange list help dietary compliance promote healthy food choice . The weight-reducing diet macronutrient micronutrient profile accordance dietary regulation set forth Canada 's Food Guide dietary reference intake ( DRIs ) . The macronutrient profile 2 moderate protein group ( control DairyPro ) 15:30:55 ( PRO : Fat : CHO ) , whereas subject High dairy protein group ( HiDairyPro ) consume profile 30:30:40 ( 15 % substitution carbohydrate protein ) . Subjects consume food ( aside designate drink ) manner choose accordance macronutrient profile respective randomization allocation . Adherence prescribe diet via collection assign biweekly food record , frequent contact subject , regular dietary counseling session . In addition , subject give custom exercise prescription consist supervise resistance exercise aerobic exercise . Intensity duration exercise session monitor energy expenditure quantify use portable , validate unit integrate accelerometry , heat flux skin temperature . Exercise take place supervise set McMaster University . Subjects perform exercise 7d/wk exercise supervise 5d/wk ( Mon - Fri ) . Resistance training session take place 2x/week . During session , subject engage circuit weightlifting routine use guided motion machine .</detailed_description>
