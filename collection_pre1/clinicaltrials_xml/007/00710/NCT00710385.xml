	<brief_summary>The study design compare abuse liabilities intravenous buprenorphine buprenorphine/naloxone individual physically dependent sublingual buprenorphine . We hypothesize abuse liability buprenorphine/naloxone low buprenorphine alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abuse Liability Suboxone Versus Subutex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug dependence major international public health problem opioid dependence , notably involve heroin , major component . Opioid dependence affect estimate 13 million injection drug user ( IDUs ) worldwide . The high health service cost treatment disease related non-medical drug use high cost society drug-related behavior prompt researcher seek new medication treatment strategy opioid dependence . Buprenorphine , mu-opiate receptor partial agonist kappa-opiate receptor antagonist , one new medication significant role expand access effective opioid dependence treatment . It available Subutex ( buprenorphine alone ) Suboxone ( combination buprenorphine naloxone ) . Although commonly believe abuse potential buprenorphine low , numerous country report illicit diversion buprenorphine grow population buprenorphine abuser . Theoretically , Suboxone would lower abuse potential . When use sublingually , prescribe , amount naloxone absorb negligible . However , patient crush tablet attempt inject sniff medication , naloxone become effective opioid antagonist may precipitate withdrawal sign symptoms individual dependent full opioid agonist and/or attenuate euphoric effect buprenorphine also contain medication . To date , laboratory study evaluate abuse liability buprenorphine human use drug self-administration protocol . We propose evaluate abuse potential intravenous ( IV ) buprenorphine compare IV buprenorphine/naloxone buprenorphine-maintained injection drug user ( IDUs ) , incorporate self-administration procedure measure opioid effect . The propose study investigate condition affect self-administration IV buprenorphine buprenorphine abuser . The primary aim study compare reinforce effect IV buprenorphine IV buprenorphine/naloxone IDUs maintain different dos sublingual buprenorphine ( 2 , 8 , 24 mg/day ) . Secondary aim study compare subjective , performance physiological effect IV buprenorphine IV buprenorphine/naloxone . IV-administered placebo ( saline ) , naloxone alone , heroin alone tested neutral , negative , positive control condition , respectively . Participants ( N=12 completers ) reside inpatient unit ( General Clinical Research Unit , GCRU ) 7 8-week study . This research provide useful information clinician treat opioid dependent individual buprenorphine , importantly , provide information abuse potential effect buprenorphine multiple measure human functioning .</detailed_description>
