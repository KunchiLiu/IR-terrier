	<brief_summary>This pilot feasibility study examine novel intervention use leptin weight-reduced individual undergone bariatric surgery still remain obese . Leptin , peptide hormone secrete adipose tissue , regulator food intake energy expenditure . Administration leptin result profound weight reduction report case obese individual genetic leptin deficiency . However , obese people increase leptin level . Such individual say `` leptin-resistant '' state , whereby administration physiological concentration leptin ineffective produce significant weight reduction . Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery ( RYGBP ) effective diet alone produce long-term reduction body weight . Yet even surgery plateau weight loss though individual may still obese risk obesity relate morbidity . The investigator show plasma leptin level significantly low woman RYGBP compare BMI-matched control . This state relative hypoleptinemia leptin insufficiency suggest post-RYGBP individual may `` leptin-sensitive '' state , thus , would undergo weight loss administer dos leptin would normally result significant weight reduction . This study examine effect leptin administer self-injection twice per day body weight endocrine function . All individual receive leptin placebo different time 34 week study period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Leptin Administration After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metreleptin self-administered subcutaneous injection 0.05 mg/kg body weight twice per day ( i.e . 8 8 pm ) . This dose chosen would expect cause substantial weight loss obese non-surgical population , incur substantial injection site reaction . Subjects receive demonstration dose preparation injection addition write instruction visual aide . After run-in period , subject demonstrate preparation injection technique . Placebo injection consist sterile water equal volume metreleptin dose calculate individual . Subjects instruct continue current level physical activity . At week 16 , subject cross-over alternate treatment additional 16 week .</detailed_description>
