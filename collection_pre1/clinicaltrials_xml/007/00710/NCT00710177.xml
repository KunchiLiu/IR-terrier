	<brief_title>PTGS1 Genetic Variation Increased Risk Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension Newborn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent pulmonary hypertension newborn ( PPHN ) occur pulmonary vascular resistance fail decrease birth transition postnatal life . The affected infant severe hypoxemia , 10 % risk mortality , among survivor , 30 % incidence long term neurodevelopmental hearing deficit . The etiology PPHN majority affect infant remain unknown . Although constriction fetal ductus arteriosus response maternal intake non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) implicate PPHN case report , laboratory first provide objective evidence association . Nearly 87 % infant PPHN expose NSAID utero . Yet 25 % control infant also expose without develop PPHN . The basis biological susceptibility neonate utero NSAID exposure remain poorly understood . The hypothesis proposal PTGS1 genetic variation associate increased susceptibility ductal constriction utero NSAID exposure increase risk PPHN . This hypothesis test follow specific aim : Determine incidence PTGS1 sequence variant PPHN patient versus match control . PTGS1 sequence include 11 exon , minimum 100 bp exon flank sequence , 1 kbp upstream regulatory information . Cycle sequence perform followed analysis use capillary electrophoresis . Differences frequency sequence variant determine use Fisher 's exact test . The study also quantify NSAID exposure meconium sample use previously establish GC/MS assay correlate exposure level incidence PPHN presence absence PTGS1 sequence variant use regression analysis . Benefits include ability predict risk PPHN base PTGS1 sequence avoidance risk future , thereby reduce patient morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
