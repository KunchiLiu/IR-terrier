	<brief_summary>Patients ask participate study receive stem cell transplant treatment disease . As part stem cell transplant , give strong dos chemotherapy , kill exist stem cell . Stem cell create bone marrow . They grow different type blood cell need , include red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . We identify close relative patient whose stem cell perfect match patient , use . This type transplant call `` allogeneic '' , mean cell come donor . With type donor perfect match , typically increase risk develop graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) longer delay recovery immune system . Seventy ninety percent ( 70-90 % ) people receive unchanged marrow stem cell type donor develop severe GvHD . GvHD serious sometimes fatal side effect stem cell transplant . GvHD occur new donor cell recognize body tissue patient different donor . When happen , cell graft may attack host organ , primarily skin , liver intestine , cause severe rash , diarrhea , liver disease , even death . GvHD cause type immune cell graft call T cell . Because high risk GvHD type transplant patient receive , selectively remove T cell graft patient receive . This process , call `` CD34 selection '' , discuss detail separate consent form transplant . While stem cell selection procedure reduce risk GvHD , also result slow recovery immune system . As immune system responsible fight infection body , long recovery time transplant mean patient may increase risk infection become life threaten . In patient , immune system also fight leukemia cell reduce risk relapse . In laboratory , see cell make carry gene call iCasp9 kill encounter specific drug call AP1903 . To get iCasp9 T cell , insert use virus call retrovirus make study . The drug ( AP1903 ) use `` activate '' iCasp9 experimental drug test study normal donor , bad side effect . We hope use drug kill T cell . Other drug kill damage T cell help GvHD many study . However yet know whether AP1903 kill T cell human , even though worked experimental study human cell animal . Nor know whether kill T cell help GvHD . Because uncertainty , patient develop significant GvHD also receive standard therapy complication , addition experimental drug . We hope safety switch T cell let u give high dos T cell make immune system recover faster . These specially treat `` suicide gene '' T cell investigational product approve Food Drug Administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Because patient receive cell new gene , follow total 15 year see long-term side effect gene transfer . Before condition treatment transplant , collect 30 mL ( 6 teaspoonful ) blood patient , make cell line grow laboratory mix blood virus call EBV . Some cell blood mixed T cell blood stem cell donor , stimulate cell might cause GvHD . We add investigational agent call RFT5-dgA . The RFT5-dgA help get rid donor T cell might cause GvHD . To get iCasp9 remain T cell , insert iCasp9 gene cell . This do virus call retrovirus make study , carry iCasp9 gene T cell . The virus also another gene call CD19 , make cell express CD19 protein surface . We inject virus directly patient , special T cell make laboratory . After put virus cell , select T cell CD19 surface , know cell also iCasp9 gene . We perform test specially treat cell give patient , ensure carry iCasp9 gene , virus . This ensure virus come cell infect cell body . TREATMENT PLAN : To prepare body transplantation , patient give high-dose chemotherapy . Further discussion treatment plan stem cell transplant discuss patient separately , sign separate consent form . If patient well transplant , serious GvHD , eligible receive special T cell Day 30 90 post-transplant . The specially select treated T cell give vein , . The cell give Day 30 day 90 patient receives stem cell transplant . We give special medicine IV start help prevent allergic reaction might occur . Because possibility specially treat T cell cause worsen GvHD , able give cell patient already significant GvHD . If patient develop GvHD give specially treat T cell , prescribe new drug show kill cell carry iCasp9 . The drug 's name AP1903 . It test normal healthy volunteer , cause bad effect , approve FDA . Although drug approve FDA , FDA allow u use drug study . This drug give 2-hour intravenous infusion . We take 10 mL ( 2 teaspoonful ) blood day 2 , 4 , 7 14 infusion check drug successful kill specially treat cell . If patient mild GvHD , GvHD get good AP1903 , give patient additional medicine usually use treat GvHD . If patient serious GvHD , immediately give additional medicine usually use treat GvHD , well AP1903 . In case though , GvHD respond treatment .</detailed_description>
