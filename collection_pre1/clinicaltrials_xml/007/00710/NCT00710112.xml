	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine sequence variation gene involve development function vulnerable organ increase susceptibility chronic lung disease ( CLD ) diseases affect premature infant , necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , sepsis , patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) . The study also determine whether measurement certain biomarkers serum identify infant develop complication prematurity . Previous study institution others identify genetic variant gene , toll like receptor gene associate high risk CLD NEC . The interaction variant gene variant influence risk disease remain unclear .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic lung disease prematurity ( CLD ) diagnose 30-40 % low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant ( &lt; 1500gms ) remain leading cause mortality long-term morbidity population . Other disease necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , sepsis , patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) , intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) also contribute mortality morbidity population . A central tenet pathogenesis NEC , CLD sepsis failure host genome-regulated immune defense surmount challenge pose microbial pathogen presence risk-factors induce intestinal , pulmonary systemic injury , respectively . Toll like receptor ( TLRs ) pathogen recognition receptor serve recognition effector arm innate immune system . Since premature infant predominantly dependent innate immune system host defense hypothesis hypomorphic genetic variation TLRs increase susceptibility diseases prematurity CLD sepsis.The increase risk inflammation , decrease potential repair growth lung may reflect level biomarkers , , cytokine , micro-RNAs ( miRNA ) peptide secrete biological fluid , like blood tracheal aspirate . It likely genetic variant increase risk inflammation decrease repair growth also associate altered level biomarkers . Measurement biomarkers genetic variant together increase precision early predictor complication prematurity . Measurement biomarkers biological fluid do short turnaround time gene sequence present time . Biomarkers also provide longitudinal change severity disease response therapy . Newer multiplex assay make feasible measure level biomarkers small quantity biological fluid . These complementary strength make gene sequence biomarker detection ideal 1-2 approach early identification disease progression evaluation premature infant . Our hypothesis test VLBW infant four specific aim : ( 1 ) To determine whether presence previously describe single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) TLR4 ( Asp299Gly , Thr399Ile ) TLR2 ( Arg753Gln ) TLR5 ( Arg392STOP ) gene associate increase risk CLD ; ( 2 ) detect DNA sequence novel genetic variation TLR4 , TLR2 , TLR9 , MyD88 innate immune gene increase risk CLD disease premature infant ; ( 3 ) identify gene sequence approach whether variant repair growth gene alter susceptibility disease affect premature infant CLD , NEC sepsis PDA IVH ; ( 4 ) whether alteration cytokine , miRNA biomarker level serum blood sample provide additional predictive value recognize risk disease prematurity . VLBW infant develop CLD ( oxygen requirement 36 week postconceptional age ) , NEC , sepsis , PDA , IVH serve case VLBW infant develop diseases interest serve control . A 0.5cc sample blood collect enrolled infant via indwell catheter heel-stick DNA analysis consent obtain . The TLR4 ( Asp299Gly , Thr399Ile ) TLR2 ( Arg753Gln ) TLR5 ( Arg392STOP ) SNPs evaluate use multiplex Single Base extension base technique , use commercially available primer . Novel genetic variation gene interest variant propose related NEC detect use conventional Sanger Next Generation DNA sequence . Serum separate blood sample obtain DNA isolation . Biomarker level serum analyze use multiplex EIA cytokine , sequence miRNA profile ELISA peptide level interest ( VEGF , angiopoietin-2 Nogo-B peptide ) . Benefits include possibility development risk-based preventive therapeutic strategy prevent CLD , NEC , sepsis , PDA , IVH population .</detailed_description>
