	<brief_summary>This single-site , pilot study . In study , hope learn Lido Workset sensitive measure limb spasticity patient Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . The Lido Workset FDA approve , non-invasive device use assess motor function spasticity . The test take approximately 25 minute . Subjects lie table leg attach Lido Workset device arm . The Lido Workset move leg back forth many time different speed . The Lido Workset also analyze resistance passive ( subject move resist movement ) movement wrist knee .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lido Workset Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The information gather test individual spasticity due multiple sclerosis Lido Workset important make adjustment Lido Workset show great degree sensitivity assess vary degree spasticity . Healthy control subject use compare spasticity data multiple sclerosis subject subject normal muscle tone determine sensitivity Lido measurement . The test perform one time patient take approximately 25 minute . The servo-controlled torque motor system analyze resistance passive movement knee . This testing may repeat group randomly select subject MS subject control subject . The test subset subject do follow : first session , second session one week first session , third session three week first session . The total length time participation study may three week . This additional testing do order compare result Lido data obtain similar timepoints subject enrol Cannabis Spasticity MS study . Each subject give option participate extend test decline .</detailed_description>
