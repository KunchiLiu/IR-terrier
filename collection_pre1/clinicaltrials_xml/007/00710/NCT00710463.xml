	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Hospital base , comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation patient COPD GOLD stage IV optimize application nocturnal non invasive ventilation . This hypotheses shall test observational trial , compare rehabilitation effect prospectively observe group receive non invasive ventilation , compare wiht historical control group patient receive treatment without non invasive ventilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Role Nocturnal Non-Invasive Ventilation Pulmonary Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non invasive ventilation know allow improvement apply endurance training , technically difficult . Nocturnal application non invasive ventilation know unload ventilatory pump , reset control breathing , improve sleep quality . The protocol also aim evaluate acceptance non invasive ventilation patient undergo four week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme .</detailed_description>
