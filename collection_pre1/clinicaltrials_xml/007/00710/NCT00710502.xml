The purpose study determine safety , feasibility short-term clinical outcome ( Phase I trial ) transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy female patient symptomatic cholelithiasis compare Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy ( Phase II ) . Hypothesis 1 : Transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy safe feasible female patient symptomatic cholelithiasis . Hypothesis 2 : The short term outcomes Transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy comparable Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy female patient symptomatic cholelithiasis . Aim 1 : Determine safety Transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy . Aim 2 : Determine feasibility Transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy . Aim 3 : Determine short-term outcome Transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy . Aim 4 : Compare short-term outcome Transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy Laparoscopic cholecystectomy .</brief_summary>
