	<detailed_description>Life style intervention include diet exercise recommend strategy prevention type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . First-degree relative patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) increase risk insulin resistance T2DM . According current paradigm , inherited environmental factor cause insulin resistance increase intramyocellular lipid metabolite stimulation inflammatory pathway interfere insulin signal transduction lead impaired rise glucose-6-phosphate ( G6P ) upon insulin stimulation indicate impaired glucose transport/phosphorylation . In sedentary human , alteration coexist excessive storage triglyceride intramyocellular hepatocellular lipid ( IMCL , HCL ) . This indicate reduction musclesÂ´ oxidative capacity confirm demonstration decrease mitochondrial function and/or number insulin resistant state age , increased availability plasma free fatty acid ( FFA ) overt T2DM . Likewise , severely insulin resistant , nondiabetic relative present elevate FFA , IMCL HCL along impair mitochondrial ATP synthesis likely result reduce mitochondrial content . However , unclear whether alteration due inherited abnormality mitochondrial biogenesis secondary chronically impaired glucose tolerance , increase lipid availability inflammatory process control cytokine adiponectin , visfatin retinol bind protein-4 ( RBP4 ) . Likewise remain uncertain extent abnormality reversible physical exercise stimulation and/or occur independently effect insulin action . Long-term endurance exercise training increase insulin sensitivity sedentary young elderly healthy , first degree relative type 2 diabetic patient , glucose intolerant obese nondiabetic type 2 diabetic human . Exercise training least 4 week also enhance fat oxidation along increased size , number enzyme activity mitochondrion . However , little known time course onset exercise-induced change glucose energy metabolism independently acute exercise effect occur within first 24 hour . At 48 hour one bout aerobic exercise , insulin-stimulated glucose disposal IMCL increase unchanged . Effects short-term exercise underlie energy generate pathway yet report vivo human . Flux inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) ATP ATP synthase ( fATPase ) provide measure mitochondrial ATP synthesis . We use multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) simultaneously measure fATP well G6P , IMCL HCL three bout cycle training . We test hypothesis short-term exercise training simultaneously increase fATPase insulin sensitivity healthy human ( control ) relatives . Furthermore , investigate whether baseline fATPase reflect whole-body oxidative capacity whether post-exercise fATPase influence lipid availability due alteration IMCL , HCL circulate triglyceride FFA .</detailed_description>
