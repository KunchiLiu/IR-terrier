	<detailed_description>Background Compared general population , patient schizophrenia increase risk death atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) reflect coronary heart disease , stroke peripheral vascular disease ( Newcomer , 2007 ) . Among factor contribute increase prevalence ASCVD schizophrenia ) unhealthy lifestyle ( cigarette smoking , lack physical activity , increase consumption calorie-dense food rich saturate fat carbohydrate ) , b ) genetic vulnerability glucose intolerance diabetes ; c ) metabolic side-effects psychotropic drug ; ) lack access compliance community-based medical care , particularly clozapine olanzapine . Biologically , common pathway lead increase risk ASCVD schizophrenia metabolic syndrome , entity define 3 follow 5 characteristic : abdominal obesity , increase blood pressure , increase fast glucose , increased level triglyceride abnormally low level high-density lipoprotein cholesterol . The prevalence metabolic syndrome schizophrenia range form 29 % 63 % significantly great frequency 21 % general population ( Correll et al. , 2006 ) . As general population , metabolic syndrome patient schizophrenia explain increased intraabdominal adiposity lead insulin resistance excess circulate free fatty acid convert triglyceride-rich lipoprotein atherogenic potential . The treatment metabolic syndrome relies primarily therapeutic lifestyle change aim reduce weight , decrease intake saturate fat carbohydrate high glycemic index , eliminate smoking , increase physical activity . Drug therapy require patient fail respond lifestyle change American Heart Association ( AHA ) publish detailed guideline pharmacologic management metabolic syndrome ( Grundy et al. , 2005 ) . These guideline base research indicate substantial improvement risk ASCVD patient metabolic syndrome treat metformin acarbose impair glucose tolerance ; statin , fibrates nicotinic acid lipid abnormality ; angiotensin receptor blocker increase blood pressure ; sibutramine orlistat weight management . Some intervention ( e.g. , metformin sibutramine weight management ) complete research setting small sample patient schizophrenia ( Henderson et al. , 2005 ; Wu et al. , 2008 ) produce promising result . However , treatment trial use comprehensive AHA guideline yet conduct schizophrenic metabolic syndrome . Current Standard Care Zucker Hillside Hospital The Aftercare Clinic Zucker Hillside Hospital old Clozapine Clinic U.S . Opened 1987 , Clozapine Clinic current enrollment 230 adult patient . According hospital policy , Clozapine Clinic patient must annual physical evaluation laboratory test detection obesity , dyslipidemia , glucose intolerance , hypertension metabolic syndrome . The mandatory physical examination perform patient 's outside physician Clinic 's Nurse Practitioners . Laboratory test perform Long Island Jewish Medical Center 's laboratory . The physical examination laboratory finding review patient 's psychiatrist . Patients physical laboratory abnormality refer care internal medicine specialist ( i.e. , general internal medicine , endocrinology , cardiology ) private practice appropriate outpatient clinic Long Island Jewish Medical Center deem necessary psychiatrist . At present time , know many schizophrenia patient metabolic syndrome treat Aftercare Program ( outpatient clinic ) ZHH receive care accord standard define American Heart Association . Objective We plan evaluate effect application AHA guideline treatment metabolic syndrome patient schizophrenia receive clozapine , antipsychotic know produce weight gain metabolic abnormality majority patient ( Newcomer , 2006 ) . The study include outpatient receive care Clozapine Clinic . . The study 's primary aim compare effectiveness manage metabolic syndrome schizophrenia site psychiatric outpatient service ( integrate care ) treatment obtain coordinate patient Hillside psychiatrist ( usual care ) . We propose Integrated care remove access barrier , improve compliance , enhance communication psychiatry internal medicine provider , facilitate education weight management smoking cessation . The management metabolic syndrome patient receive integrate care adhere AHA guideline ( Grundy et al. , 2005 ) describe dietary , exercise pharmacologic intervention extensively validate general population . All medication suggest guideline FDA-approved individual component metabolic syndrome . The 'usual care ' group receive current standard care set Hillside Hospital . Importance Study This first randomized trial `` no-barriers '' model medical care underserved vulnerable mentally ill population . To increase homogeneity study population significance expect difference integrate usual care , study ass patient psychiatric diagnosis ( schizophrenia ) , treat psychotropic ( clozapine ) single , well-established outpatient setting . The duration study adequate demonstrate whether metabolic syndrome component respond life style modification /or specific pharmacological intervention . Research Design Methods Hypothesis Integrated , on-site , medical management metabolic syndrome patient schizophrenia superior usual care community , primarily remove barrier related access medical provider increase compliance drug therapy laboratory test . The improvement lead decrease frequency metabolic syndrome sample , decrease risk future ASCVD event ( predict AHA-recommended instrument ) , decreased waist circumference , fast glucose , blood pressure triglyceride level increase level HDL .</detailed_description>
