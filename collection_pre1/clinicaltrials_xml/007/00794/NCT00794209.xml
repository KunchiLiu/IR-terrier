	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Inhaled AeroLEF Delivered 4 Aerosol Delivery Devices Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . Device Qualification Phase The Device Qualification Phase open-label , five-period , crossover design . Subjects receive one dose ( 5mL ) inhale AeroLEF ( 500 mcg/mL fentanyl base ) administer Opti-Mist continuous flow jet nebulizer ( test device ) , one dose ( 5mL ) inhale AeroLEF ( 500 mcg/mL fentanyl base ) administer Misty-Neb continuous flow jet nebulizer ( test device ) , one dose ( 5mL ) inhale AeroLEF ( 500 mcg/mL fentanyl base ) administer PARI-LC Plus continuous flow jet nebulizer ( test device ) , one dose ( 3mL ) inhale AeroLEF ( 500 mcg/mL fentanyl base ) administer AeroEclipse breath-actuated nebulizer ( reference device ) treatment session 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 . A washout period least 7 day separate dosing session . In fourth treatment session ( session 4 ) , subject receive single dose intravenous Fentanyl Citrate USP ( 200 mcg ) administer 1 minute , follow washout period least 7 day previous study treatment . This session conduct data analysis device qualification proceeding , result fourth session require data analysis . Nine ( 9 ) subject participate follow study visit order maintain group size 6 volunteer per session : pre-study screening ( two visit within 28 day prior first dose ) , treatment period ( five visit ) follow-up ( one visit 7-14 day follow last dosing session ) . Each visit involve pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic safety assessment schedule individual approximately time day . The pre-study screening visit confirm eligibility study , trained subject use nebulizer device pupillometry procedure . Subjects continue study comfortable use nebulizer device , pupillometry measurement system could reliably measure pupil . For treatment session , study drug administer morning treatment day , blood collection pupillometry assessment perform generate pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile immediately prior dose approximately 24 hour follow dosing . Adverse event document throughout treatment session . A safety assessment perform prior discharge clinic 24 hour post-dose . B . Device Characterization Phase This plan open-label , two-period , crossover , safety , pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic design normal , healthy , non-smoking , fast male female subject . Subjects participate Device Qualification Phase eligible participate Device Characterization Phase . Subjects would receive one dose ( 5 mL ) inhale AeroLEF ( 500 mcg/mL fentanyl base ) administer continuous flow nebulizer device , Opti-Mist , Misty-Neb PARI LC-Plus , select Device Qualification Phase study . In second treatment session , subject would receive single dose 300 mcg intravenous Fentanyl Citrate USP administer 15 minute . A washout period least 7 day plan separate two dosing session . Subjects would participate similar study visit describe Device Qualification Phase : pre-study screening ( two visit within 28 day prior first dose ) , treatment phase ( two visit ) , follow-up ( one visit ) . Pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic , safety parameter would evaluate .</detailed_description>
