	<brief_summary>Detection lymph node start involved cancer spread thyroid gland operation useful . It save patient second operation remove node later become obvious . The problem many lymph node around gland . The theory one node get first spill tumour cell . In study investigator try use inert color material inject tumour . This run path tumour cell therefore stain one lymph node affect first tumour spread . The stained lymph node excise examine instantaneously tumour affection . If find affect tumour , operation extend include removal fellow lymph node . If find free tumour , patient tumour spread .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Usefulness Staining Lymph Nodes During Operations Cancer Thyroid Detecting Nodes That Have Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include 45 consecutive patient diagnose differentiated thyroid cancer clinical examination and/or fine needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC ) . Exclusion criterion : previous neck surgery , pregnancy know hypersensitivity dye use . An informed consent obtain patient . Peroperative workup include history taking , clinical examination , relevant laboratory investigation include thyroid hormone assay , ultrasonography neck special emphasis thyroid focal lesion cervical lymph node . FNAC attempt patient . All patient subject operation : A systematized surgical approach adopt purpose study : start collar incision , development sub-platysmal skin flap separation strap muscle midline . This follow exposure thyroid gland ; identification thyroid tumour ; injection dye tumour ; wait dye reach lymph node ; identify stain node ; label sentinel node ( SLN ) ; perform total thyroidectomy bilateral central neck dissection . The resected specimen fix formaldehyde , stain hematoxylin eosin examine light microscopy . If SLN find free malignant deposit , examine immunohistochemical staining . Statistical analysis : Descriptive statistic use analyze demographic data . Sensitivity , specificity predictive value SLN calculate . The histopathological report excise specimen consider criterion standard .</detailed_description>
