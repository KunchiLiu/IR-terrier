	<brief_title>Study Safety , Tolerability Efficacy V3381 Patients With Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients provide write informed consent screen entry study . Patients initially enter 2-week single-blind run-in phase , complete 11 point numerical pain rating scale ( NPRS ) average daily pain ; patient mean weekly score &gt; 4 &lt; 9 allow continue study randomisation ( unless exhibit &gt; 50 % decrease pain score , compare Day -14 score , run-in ) . Patients randomise receive either Placebo ( PL ) bid ( n=75 ) V3381 ( n=75 ) initially treat 100 mg V3381 ( placebo equivalent ) twice daily ( bid ) one week . Patients remain study treatment throughout trial . At end one week patient adequately tolerate study medication escalate dose V3381 200 mg bid blind basis . Patients tolerate 100 mg bid withdrawn . After one week treatment 200 mg bid dose level , subject continue tolerate adequately 200 mg bid study drug escalate 300 mg bid . Subjects tolerate 200 mg bid dose may revert 100 mg bid dose remain dose level remainder trial . After 2 week treatment subject continue tolerate adequately 300 mg bid study drug escalate 400 mg bid . Subjects tolerate 300 mg bid dose may revert 200 mg bid dose remain dose level remainder trial . Subjects remain dos ( , dose V3381 placebo tolerate ) remain 9 week treatment period . In exceptional case new intolerability developing , patient may down-titrated next low dose level . All patient provide rescue medication paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) 650 mg four time daily ( North America [ NA ] ) 1000 mg three time daily ( Europe [ EU ] ) supplement study drug , wish , throughout study , include single-blind placebo phase . Patients expect attend clinic 9 time ( Screening , Baseline , Week 1 , Week 2 , Week 4 , Week 7 , Week 10 , Week 13 Follow-up clinic visit ) safety efficacy assessment . The safety assessment include biochemistry , haematology urinalysis test , 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , vital sign , record adverse event , Beck Depression Inventory , review medication compliance , blood glucose control . The following assessment also conduct clinic visit treatment follow : - Modified Brief Pain Inventory diabetic painful neuropathy ( DPN ) - Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory - Patient Clinical Global Impression score - Investigator Clinical Global Impression score The Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 , Version 2 assess baseline Visit 8 . Subjects complete home diary daily basis rate average pain use 11-point Likert NPRS . Sleep interference score , bad daily pain use rescue medication also record daily diary . A Steering Committee establish provide oversight conduct trial . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) convene periodically review patient safety .</detailed_description>
