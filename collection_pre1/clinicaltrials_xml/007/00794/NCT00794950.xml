	<brief_summary>A majority patient bladder cancer disease confine inner lining bladder . Patients high risk feature ( high grade tumor , tumor invade deep superficial layer ) routinely treat Bacillus Calmette Guerin ( BCG ) instill bladder tumor remove . While 55 % patient respond BCG , failure respond may suggest aggressive tumor require definitive therapy complete bladder removal . BCG believe work stimulate body 's immune system attack tumor cell . It may also work block machinery tumor use grow blood vessel fuel tumor growth . A new oral drug , sunitinib show help patient metastatic bladder cancer block new blood vessel growth ( VEGF inhibition ) . The investigator study use BCG follow sunitinib patient high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer evaluate complete response ( visible evidence tumor bladder ) 3 month 6 month . The investigator also evaluate whether recurrent tumor three year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Followed Sunitinib Treatment High Risk Non-muscle Invasive Lower Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite complete response 45-55 % patient non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma involve low urinary tract 3 month , many patient suffer multiple recurrence progression 1/3 patient . While radical cystectomy effective local therapy patient high risk non-invasive disease , roughly 15 % patient still develop progression . More importantly , morbidity radical cystectomy describe represent barrier treatment individual . Thus , real need identify new therapy reduce morbidity improve outcome patient non-invasive urothelial cancer . While multiple drug regimen standard many form cancer include invasive bladder cancer , report exist multidrug regimen non-invasive bladder cancer . The fundamentally agree upon mechanism action BCG intravesical therapy superficial bladder cancer generation non-specific immune response expression cytokine inflammatory cell result tumor death . Cytokines produce BCG therapy IFNÎ± may block vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) express superficial invasive bladder cancer may provide mechanism disease progression . Sunitinib oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor block VEGF . Recent report demonstrate clinical response patient metastatic bladder cancer treat sunitinib recurrence follow standard chemotherapeutic regimen . The addition sunitinib follow BCG order consolidate VEGF inhibition may result superior 3 month complete response rate . We know patient complete response BCG 3 month improve disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm urothelial carcinoma confine urinary bladder and/or prostatic urethra bladder biopsy within 6 week study enrollment . Patients eligible biopsy do within 3 month enrollment cystoscopy demonstrate gross disease within 6 week enrollment . Tumor histology &gt; 50 % transitional cell carcinoma histology Tumor stage less equal T1 confirm pathology report Patients T1 tumor require restaging TURBT confirm high stage tumor prior study enrollment High grade tumor define WHO/ISUP 1998 classification system . ( Presence carcinoma situ constitute high grade tumor ) No BCG within 12 month enrollment Patients allow receive single dose intravesical chemotherapy ( exclude BCG ) operating room follow transurethral resection document nonmuscle invasive urothelial carcinoma lower urinary tract . Patients allow receive previous 6 week cycle standard intravesical chemotherapy &gt; 3 month prior enrollment . Age &gt; 18 year . ECOG performance status 0 1 Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin less equal 1.5 upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl MUGA scan within institutional normal limit Timing guideline prestudy labs measurement : All prestudy lab require determination eligibility complete within 6 week prior registration . Xrays and/or scan determine disease status complete within 6 month prior registration ( next business day fall weekend holiday ) . Patients prior history radiation bladder cancer Patients prior history radiation prostate cancer eligible study Greater equal T2N0M0 transitional cell carcinoma bladder current pathology past Patients prior history upper tract urothelial carcinoma eligible participation study long evidence disease 6 month prior study enrollment Patients malignancy eligible enrollment study active treatment malignancy within 12 month study enrollment . Patients prior history local treatment prostate cancer eligible participation study Patients receive Sunitinib antiangiogenic therapy least 12 month prior enrollment study History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition BCG Sunitinib Patients prior systemic infection BCG eligible study Patients prior intolerance BCG may consider Major incisional surgery within 4 week study enrollment Bleeding diathesis unresolved gross hematuria bladder biopsy Known HIV positive patient may participate . This avoid additional complication immune suppression HIV infection may cause due treatment BCG , live attenuate bacteria know cause systemic infection patient immunocompromised . Patients take agent result immunosuppression eligible study due potential increase risk systemic infection patient receive BCG Any follow within 6 month prior study drug administration : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE grade 2 . Patients history suspect CHF include long asymptomatic ejection fraction equal institutional low limit normal baseline MUGA ( obtain within 28 day registration next business day fall weekend holiday ) . QTc interval &gt; 500 msec baseline EKG ( do within 6 week prior registration next business day fall weekend holiday ) . Hypertension control medication ( &gt; 150/100 mm Hg despite optimal medical therapy ) . Patient may unresolved bacterial infection . Patients hypothyroidism adequately control medication exclude . All patient monitor trial initiation TSH . Concurrent treatment another clinical trial . Supportive care trial nontreatment trial , e.g . QOL , allow . Pregnancy breastfeed . Female subject must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception period therapy . All female subject reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) prior enrollment . Male subject must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception period therapy . The definition effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make subject inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
