	<brief_summary>The aim study assess superiority new low sodium peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) solution PDsol 12 comparison conventional , already market solution , Gambrosol trio 40 , treatment hypertensive peritoneal dialysis patient aim decrease hypertension improve sodium/water balance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Low Sodium Peritoneal Dialysis ( PD ) Solution Hypertensive Patients Treated With PD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension well sodium water retention common end-stage renal disease patient peritoneal dialysis expose patient leave ventricular hypertrophy increase cardiovascular mortality . Moreover poor control dry weight sodium/water balance result increase morbidity . A previous low sodium study computer simulation show sodium removal improve low sodium fluid , allow achieve negative sodium balance without alter water balance . The aim study ass whether treatment one low sodium bag substitute one isotonic glucose bag every day order reduce blood pressure and/or medication hypertension , define primary endpoint . In order evaluate main criterion , blood pressure , 24hours Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ( ABPM ) perform twice study , Baseline 8 week treatment , accord EMEA guidance recommendation anti-hypertensive treatment . In addition , self measurement blood pressure perform patient home three consecutive day visit well case symptom hypotension . The study design three period : - Run-in period 1 month : reference product Gambrosol Trio 40 , one bag/ day use patient . This period dedicate train patient use study product , stabilize patient PD treatment randomize patient , perform 24h ABPM . - Efficacy &amp; Safety period 6 month : patient treat one two product : PDsol 12 ( studied product ) Gambrosol Trio 40 ( reference product ) 6 month . The aim period evaluate efficacy long-term tolerance new PD fluid . - Follow-up period 2 month : without treatment . This period dedicate ensure safety patient study product treatment stop obtain information reversibility product effect .</detailed_description>
