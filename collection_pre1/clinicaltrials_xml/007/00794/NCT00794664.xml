	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Mipomersen Patients With Severe Hypercholesterolemia Maximally Tolerated Lipid-Lowering Regimen Who Are Not Apheresis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercholesterolemia characterize markedly elevate low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) . Elevated LDL major risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Mipomersen antisense drug reduces protein liver cell call apolipoprotein B ( Apo-B ) . Apo-B plays role produce low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) ( `` bad '' cholesterol ) move liver one 's bloodstream . High LDL-C independent risk factor development coronary heart disease ( CHD ) diseases blood vessel . It show lower LDL-C reduces risk heart attack major adverse cardiovascular event . The purpose study determine whether mipomersen safely effectively lower LDL-C severely hypercholesterolemic patient maximally tolerate lipid-lowering regimen apheresis .</detailed_description>
