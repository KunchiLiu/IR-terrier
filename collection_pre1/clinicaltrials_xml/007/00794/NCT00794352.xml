	<brief_summary>Inflammatory degenerative disease brain spinal cord , multiple sclerosis , may relate problem individual immune system . However , information need way cell immune system interact central nervous system ( CNS ) . This study compare test perform healthy volunteer individual sign symptom immune-related damage CNS . This study include two group subject age 12 75 . Subjects either symptom immune-related CNS damage , healthy volunteer select comparison purpose . Study participant visit NIH Clinical Center outpatient basis initial evaluation visit . During visit , patient provide comprehensive medical history undergo neurological examination , provide blood sample research purpose . The healthy volunteer ask schedule return visit magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedure , may ask undergo test request study researcher as-needed basis . The group patient symptoms immune-related CNS damage ask undergo series test , include follow : - MRI procedure , minimum three brain MRIs one spinal cord MRI take approximately 4 week apart - A diagnostic lumbar puncture , perform outpatient basis - Tests brain vision activity - Additional blood tissue sample All study participant return followup visit 1 year initial evaluation visit . Patients symptoms immune-related CNS damage may offer opportunity participate additional followup test NIH researcher .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The goal study define pathophysiological mechanism underlie development disability immune-mediated disorder central nervous system ( CNS ) distinguish physiological ( often beneficial ) responses human immune system CNS injury . The long-term objective study acquire knowledge would allow u therapeutically inhibit pathogenic mechanism enhance repair mechanism immune-mediated CNS disease , thereby minimize extent CNS tissue damage promote recovery . Study Population : Patients evidence immune-mediated CNS injury enrol . In addition , healthy volunteer include control immunological neuroimaging biomarkers . Design : We collect , standardized manner , multimodal data ( clinical/functional , neuroimaging molecular/immunological data ) diagnostic work-up untreated patient vary disorder CNS immune-mediated process expect play pathophysiological role . For patient cohort , comprehensive initial evaluation perform order establish definitive diagnosis confirm diagnosis subtype multiple sclerosis ( MS ) pre-requisite enrollment ongoing clinical trial , also collect consistent multimodal research data . This evaluation include standardize clinical exam , functional test quantify clinical disability , MRI neuroimaging modality , CSF serological study , lymphapheresis . Additional diagnostic test , tailor individual patient , may perform require diagnostic process . The protocol stipulate one-year mandatory follow-up patient inclusive clinical MRI imaging , well repetition additional imaging functional testing perform initial evaluation . Depending specific diagnosis , treatment decision clinical/research need , patient may offer additional follow-up visit . The maximum frequency follow-up visit research sample collect specified order ensure patient safety compromise . Patients age 12-17 may also include patient cohort inorder establish definitive diagnosis , provide non-standard assay help diagnostic therapeutic decision part extraordinary care . The volunteer cohort provide sex age-matched normative value immunological image parameter . Outcome Measures : Clinical , MRI immunological measure outcome measure . However , pre-defined research question address establish diagnosis , determine level disease activity , monitor natural history .</detailed_description>
