	<brief_title>Feedback Intervention Treatment Times ST- Elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For many patient myocardial infarction ST-segment elevation ( STEMI ) , time presentation percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) exceed establish goal . Formalized data feedback one strategy propose reduce treatment time STEMI-patients . The aim multicenter study evaluate whether systematic data analysis feedback lead short contact-to-balloon door-to-balloon time reduce mortality different regional care network serve patient STEMI . The multicenter trial include hospital primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) capacity . Existing protocols encourage prompt transfer patient STEMI PCI center emphasize minimizing time treatment . In participate center , patient present STEMI enrol . The study conduct prospectively five consecutive 3-month period ( quarter ) . Data collection web-based identical five quarter . For center , time point initial contact medical system revascularization assess , analyze present interactive session hospital emergency service staff . This formalize data feedback perform end quarter . Patients present first three-month period include reference group . Data patient STEMI present next four quarter present manner . Comparisons reference group next quarter make Gehan Pearson Ï‡2 test . Following Pilot Phase start feasibility study include group 6 different hospital system STEMI care , multicenter FITT-STEMI-Implementation-Phase start investigate effect standardize documentation , analysis systematic feedback-intervention prognosis within large group different hospital capable primary PCI . This study perform 6 quarter include 3 feedback-sessions , far , 46 different PCI-hospitals capable primary PCI participate FITT-STEMI-implementation-phase . Following initial study period quarterly feedback-sessions , data collection continue , hospital feedback-sessions EMS- hospital-staff hold year ( quarter 8 , 12 , 16 , ) . Participating hospital So far , total 53 hospital-systems primary PCI capacity cooperate non-PCI-hospitals participate FITT-STEMI-program . At PCI-Centers , 24 h PCI capability exist least one year prior inclusion , least two interventional cardiologist could take call , volume least 250 PCI procedure well 50 PCI procedure STEMI patient per year require participation project . All 6 key strategy ACC D2B-initiative ( Bradley EH , NEJ 2006 ) endorse hospital participate project . All hospital ensure prompt transfer patient STEMI PCI center minimize time treatment . The overall geographic catchment area currently serve population 10 million people Germany 5,500 STEMI patient per year , consistent &gt; 10 % German population &gt; 10 % patient treat acute STEMI German hospital per year .</detailed_description>
