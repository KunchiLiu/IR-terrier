	<detailed_description>Primary hypertension important risk factor lead cardiovascular event . Successful management hypertension key prevent event . Hyperhomocysteinemia ( HHcy ) another independent risk factor , especially stroke . Our team 's prospective nest case-control study 39165 subject China show incidence cardiovascular event ( especially stroke ) strongly associate plasma level total homocysteine ( tHcy ) . The coexistence hypertension HHcy dramatically increase risk stroke 25 30 time compare subject without two risk factor ( Graham et al , 1997 ) . Findings previous study clearly indicate simultaneous control hypertension HHcy pivotal reduce cardiovascular event morbidity mortality China . It well document folic acid effective lower level plasma tHcy . While controversial remains efficacy prevent cardiovascular event , study do team : `` Efficacy folic acid supplementation stroke prevention : meta-analysis '' ( Wang et al , 2007 ) provide coherent evidence folic acid supplementation decrease risk stroke 18 % , 25 % population folic fortification issue , use primary prevention . C677T gene polymorphism 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) one genetic determinators plasma tHcy level . Observational study show individual TT genotype tend high plasma tHcy elevate risk cardiovascular event ( Cronin et al . 2005 ) , folic acid supplementation lead remarkable reduction plasma tHcy . In short , previous study others team provide strong rationale propose trial detail . The hypothesis current study combination antihypertensive drug ( e.g. , enalapril ) folic acid efficacious , also safe highly cost-effective antihypertensive ( e.g. , enalapril ) use alone prevent stroke hypertensive patient . This trial enroll 20,000 patient primary hypertension know MTHFR C677T genotype . Subjects first stratify genotype , randomly assign treatment group . The study patient instruct take orally enalapril 10 mg daily enalapril/folic acid 10mg/0.8mg tablet daily maximum 5 year . The follow-up give every 3 month . The incidence time first-time stroke episode ( primary endpoint ) composite cardiovascular event use endpoint . They compare treatment group without stratification C677T gene polymorphism . The potential interaction treatment group C677T gene polymorphism therapeutic efficacy also test . This first large trial kind Chinese population . The finding trial may potential transform current clinical public health finding practice .</detailed_description>
