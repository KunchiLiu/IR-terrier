	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary aim : - Determine 25 gram flaxseed supplementation daily - modifies proliferation ( ki-67 ) apoptotic rate six month - modifies expression estrogen regulate gene : Cyclin D1 , survivin , VEGF six month - modifies serum IGF-1 serum bind protein ( IGFBP ) -3 level baseline 6 month - evaluate feasibility tolerability flaxseed consumption , determine factor lead decrease compliance STUDY OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I ( intervention ) : Patients ingest 25 gram grind flaxseed daily , already prepared food , 6 month . Patients instructed record time food flaxseed consume , number bowel movement daily . Throughout 6-month intervention period , patient also complete unannounced telephone-administered survey recount food beverage consume within previous 24 hour . - Arm II ( observation ) : Patients receive ground flaxseed . All patient complete diary menstrual cycle duration presence improvement premenstrual symptom ( e.g. , cramp , bloating , headache , insomnia , irregular symptom ) . Patients also complete questionnaire 1 , 3 , 6 month access change diet , physical activity , menstrual history , demographic characteristic , medical history specimen questionnaire baseline 1 , 3 , 6 month . Blood first-void urine sample collect baseline 1 , 3 , 6 month measure level lignan metabolite , flaxseed compliance , serum thiocyanate , malondialdehyde , biomarker study capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry , high-performance liquid chromatography , ELISA . After completion study therapy , patient follow monthly 6 month .</detailed_description>
