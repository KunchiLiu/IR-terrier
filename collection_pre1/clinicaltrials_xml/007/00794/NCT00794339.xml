	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure , copper Cu 64-ATSM PET/CT scan , may help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well copper Cu 64-ATSM PET/CT scan work predict disease progression patient undergo standard care treatment cisplatin radiation therapy ( external beam brachytherapy ) per NCCN guideline newly-diagnosed stage IB , stage II , stage III , stage IVA cervical cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial 64Cu-ATSM PET/CT Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To define role pre-therapy ^64Cu-labeled diacetyl-bis ( N4-methylthiosemicarbazone ) ( copper Cu 64-ATSM ) predict prognosis determine behavior invasive squamous cell cervical cancer patient newly-diagnosed stage IB2-IVA cervical squamous cell carcinoma . - To determine whether high copper Cu 64-ATSM uptake associate low progression-free survival patient chemoradiotherapy . Secondary - To determine high copper Cu 64-ATSM uptake associate low overall survival patient . - To determine high copper Cu 64-ATSM uptake associate earlier primary cervical tumor recurrence high rate development distant metastatic disease patient . - To determine high copper Cu 64-ATSM uptake associate low frequency complete metabolic response FDG-PET/CT scan perform 3 month completion radiotherapy chemotherapy . - To estimate accuracy copper Cu 64-ATSM uptake predictor progression-free survival , overall survival , primary tumor recurrence , future development distant metastatic disease patient . - To evaluate performance copper Cu 64-ATSM uptake predictor lymph node metastasis study entry . - To evaluate whether copper Cu 64-ATSM uptake correlate tumor volume study entry . - To examine relationship tumor uptake copper Cu 64-ATSM marker tumor hypoxia , include VEGF , GLUT-1 , CA-IX , OPN . - To compare predictive ability pre-therapy copper Cu 64-ATSM-PET post-therapy FDG-PET/CT scan . - To assess whether pre-therapy FDG-PET/CT finding predictive progression-free survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive copper Cu 64-ATSM IV undergo PET/CT scan 30 minute 30-40 minute later . Within 4 week copper Cu 64-ATSM-PET/CT scan , patient begin plan concurrent standard care chemoradiotherapy comprise 6 week radiotherapy ( external beam brachytherapy ) weekly cisplatin administration per NCCN guideline . Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT scan 3 month completion chemoradiotherapy . Tissue sample previously collect cervical biopsy ( obtain diagnosis ) use detect hypoxic marker immunohistochemistry analysis . After completion study intervention , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
