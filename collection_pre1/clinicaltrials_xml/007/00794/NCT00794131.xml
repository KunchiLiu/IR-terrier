	<brief_title>Safety Study GL-ONC1 , Oncolytic Virus , Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In preclinical study , GL-ONC1 oncolytic vaccinia virus , show ability preferentially locate , colonize destroy tumor cell . This study seek evaluate safety profile attenuate vaccinia virus administer intravenously patient advance solid tumor . The study also seek detect virus delivery primary and/or metastatic tumor , include evaluation viral delivery fluorescence imaging ( GFP expression ) ; whether anti-vaccinia virus immune response occur ; record evidence anti-tumor activity . For Cohorts 8 Expansion Cohort 1B , CTC count , virus-encoded marker gene analysis Dynamic Contrast ( DCE-MRI ) MRI image use evaluate tumor micro-circulation vivo . These measure evaluate potential predictive value survival outcome , evaluate correlation pharmacodynamic response rate indicator GL-ONC1 treatment context .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Diagnosis histologically cytologically document , advanced stage , primary metastatic solid tumor refractory standard therapy curative standard therapy exist . Evidence measurable evaluable disease . Age must ≥ 18 year . All acute toxic effect prior radiotherapy , chemotherapy , surgical procedure must resolve Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE , Version 3.0 ) Grade ≤ 1 . Surgery must occur least 28 day prior study enrolment . Chemotherapy radiotherapy ( smallfield palliative radiotherapy ) , immunotherapy and/or hormonal therapy must receive &gt; 28 day prior receive study drug . Subjects may continue receive LHRH analogue therapy prostate cancer face rise PSA . Bisphosphonates anticoagulant permit . ECOG Performance Score ≤ 1 . Life expectancy least 3 month . Required baseline laboratory data include : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9 [ SI unit 10^9/L ] Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9 [ SI unit 10^9/L ] Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL [ SI unit gm/L ] Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN ≤ 5 x ULN presence liver metastases Ejection fraction ≥50 % MUGA ECHO . Signed informed consent indicate subject aware neoplastic nature disease inform procedure follow , experimental nature therapy , alternative potential benefit , side effect , risk , discomfort . Willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test . Female patient must negative pregnancy test within five day prior treatment . Female patient childbearing potential surgically sterile postmenopausal male patient surgically sterile must agree use highly effective contraception . Barrier method contraception must apply treatment period day 60 last virus application . The patient must agree sign consent particular inclusion criterion . Additional Inclusion Criteria Relevant Cohort 8 Phase IB Expansion Cohort : 1 . Diagnosis histologically cytologically document , advanced stage solid tumor ( e.g. , primary metastatic breast , prostate colorectal cancer ) refractory standard therapy curative standard therapy exist . 2 . Evidence measurable evaluable disease . 3 . Disease safely serially biopsied . 4 . Circulating tumor cell count &gt; 10 analysis tumor cell viral delivery . Prior therapy cytolytic virus type . Concurrent therapy investigational anticancer agent . Concurrent vaccine immunotherapy , 30 day , study therapy . Concurrent antiviral agent active vaccinia virus ( e.g . cidofovir , vaccinia immunoglobulin , imatinib , ST246 ) course study . Patients vaccinate vaccinia virus within past 10 year . Patients know brain metastasis : due poor prognosis risk develop progressive neurological dysfunction would confound evaluation neurological adverse event . Patients know allergy ovalbumin egg product . Patients immune system disorder receive immunosuppressive therapy steroid . Patients clinically significant dermatological disorder , e.g . eczema psoriasis , unhealed skin wound ulcer , assess principal investigator screen study . Patients fever , systemic infection , include know HIV infection , hepatitis B C. Prior splenectomy . Previous organ transplant . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Clinically significant cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association , Class III IV ) include preexist arrhythmia , uncontrolled angina pectoris myocardial infarction within one year prior study entry , grade 2 high compromise leave ventricular ejection fraction ( determined MUGA ) . Dementia alter mental status would prohibit informed consent . Other severe , acute , chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment principal investigator , would make subject inappropriate study .</criteria>
