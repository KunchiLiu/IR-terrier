	<brief_summary>The propose research investigate clinical outcome associate modified yoga train program patient heart failure ( HF ) . HF patient ( 15-20 ) participate modify yoga program 8 week period , two time per week instruction home practice . Baseline measure follow-up take 8 week . The underlying hypothesis test yoga-induced improvement nervous system skeletal muscle function yield positive effect clinical outcome , functional ability , health-related quality life patient HF . The effect combine yoga breathe train natural history HF potential decrease negative clinical outcome improve symptom unknown . The relevance research relate important information provide clinician care patient HF basis pilot data future NIH funding application .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose research project pilot study design delineate clinical outcome associate modified yoga program population adult ventricular dysfunction clinical heart failure ( HF ) . The researcher hypothesize patient modify yoga training program significant improvement clinical outcome , functional ability , health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) . The researcher propose evaluate 15-20 subject chronic HF New York Heart Association Functional Class ( NYHA ) II-III obtain baseline physiological , functional , HRQOL measurement . After obtain baseline measurement , patient participate modify yoga program instruction home practice 8 week . Baseline measurement include : Vital sign , oxygen saturation , heart rate variability , exercise distance , muscular strength flexibility determination , various index HRQOL . At conclusion 8 week yoga train measurement obtain . In group chronic HF patient , specific aim follow : 1 . To develop safe feasible yoga program ; 2 . To determine whether clinical outcome ( vital sign , oxygen saturation , heart rate variability ) , functional ability ( exercise distance , muscular strength flexibility determination ) , HRQOL positively affect modified yoga program .</detailed_description>
