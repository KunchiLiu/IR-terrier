	<brief_summary>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) progressive enlargement aorta , large blood vessel body . It risk burst usually fatal . Currently risk AAA bursting estimate diameter . In study , investigator hope develop new type aneurysm scan involve Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . It hop scan well determine AAAs risk burst therefore require operation prevent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) prevalence ~5 % rupture carry mortality rate ~90 % . The pathophysiology AAA encompass range poorly understood biomechanical biological process . Currently diameter aneurysm use surrogate risk rupture patient aneurysm diameter great 55 mm consider elective surgical repair . However , reliance single surrogate measure simplistic take account physical biological aspect AAA . We propose evaluate role inflammation , proteolysis neovascularisation patient AAA disease . We compare novel magnetic resonance image technique blood tissue measure inflammation ( c-reactive protein , cytokine , macrophage leucocyte density ) , proteolytic activity ( matrix metalloproteinases , tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases ) neovascularisation ( vessel density , endothelial progenitor cell ) . By compare finding patient symptomatic asymptomatic disease , study inform understand disease process well potentially identify risk marker AAA instability could use follow-up patient asymptomatic disease .</detailed_description>
