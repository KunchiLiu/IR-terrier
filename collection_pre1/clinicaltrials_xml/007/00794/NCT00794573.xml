	<brief_summary>The EVITA study clinical trial test effect varenicline ( Champix™ ) , new drug use help people quit smoking , patient suffer heart attack . Varenicline recently show increase number otherwise healthy people quit smoke compare placebo ( sugar pill ) . Although varenicline show reduce smoke healthy population , effectiveness patient recover heart attack unknown . The EVITA trial help answer question . A total 300 patient recently suffer heart attack active smoker recruit study . For twelve week , half patient receive varenicline half receive placebo pill . Patients follow period 12 month . During time , patient receive telephone call go clinic visit order ass smoking . These follow-up also assess side effect clinical event another heart attack hospitalization patient may . Smoking cessation check use exhaled carbon monoxide read self-reports . The EVITA trial first study examine use varenicline patient recently heart attack . These patient , continue smoke , high risk another cardiac event . If varenicline show useful population , major impact prevention cardiac event patient suffer heart attack .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Varenicline ( Champix ) Smoking Cessation Patients Post-Acute Coronary Syndrome ( EVITA ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . The primary objective Evaluation Varenicline ( Champix™ ) SmokIng Cessation PaTients Post-Acute Coronary Syndrome ( EVITA ) Trial evaluate impact varenicline smoking cessation rate 24 week follow enzyme-positive acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . 2 . The secondary objective examine efficacy varenicline smoking cessation rate daily cigarette reduction 52 week , determine safety varenicline patient follow ACS . Rationale : Patients continue smoke acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) 35 % increase risk reinfarction death compare quit . Many patient attempt stop smoking ACS , relapse rate approach 66 % . A variety smoke cessation aid show effective general population . However , physician reluctant use nicotine-based therapy hemodynamic effect . Varenicline recently show improve abstinence rate healthy young smoker compare bupropion ( Zyban™ ) placebo . Although varenicline successfully show reduce smoke rate healthy young population , efficacy set patient recover ACS unknown . Methods : The EVITA Trial directly compare efficacy varenicline versus placebo mean reduce smoke rate patient follow ACS . The trial multi-center effort , coordinate Jewish General Hospital/McGill University ( Montreal , Quebec ) . A total 300 patient randomize follow ACS hospital discharge . While in-hospital , patient quit smoke instruct restart smoking follow discharge . Half patient receive varenicline 12 week half receive placebo pill 12 week . Patients receive varenicline give 1.0 mg twice day 12-week treatment period . Study nurse perform telephone follow-ups patient week 1 , 2 8 , patient return clinic visit week 4 , 12 , 24 , 52 . Smoking abstinence assess follow-up clinic visit . The primary endpoint smoking abstinence 24 week . Smoking abstinence define complete abstinence week prior clinic visit level exhale carbon monoxide ≤ 10 ppm . The secondary endpoint ( smoke abstinence 52 week , side effect varenicline patient follow ACS , percent patient attain ≥ 50 % reduction daily consumption cigarettes 52 week , clinical event follow initiation treatment ) measure 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 52 week . The occurrence clinical event base observed frequency composite event include death , myocardial infarction , hospitalization unstable angina . Withdrawal symptom number cigarette smoke also assess use questionnaire . The EVITA trial require 36 month completion : 3 month preparation , 18 month patient enrollment , 12 month follow-up , 3 month data analysis manuscript preparation . Significance : The EVITA trial first examine efficacy varenicline group patient suffer ACS . These patient , continue smoke , exceptionally high risk recurrent cardiac event . If varenicline effective population , major impact secondary prevention recurrent clinical event patient suffer ACS .</detailed_description>
