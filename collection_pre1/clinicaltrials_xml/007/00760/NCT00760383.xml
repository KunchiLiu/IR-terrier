	<brief_summary>The general hypothesis older adult muscle regrowth acute musculoskeletal stress positively influence traditional physical rehabilitation , enhance nutritional supplementation . Using state-of-the-art stable isotope methodology study muscle metabolism methodology measurement cell signaling , test follow specific hypothesis : 1 ) Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) induce acute net protein catabolism mainly reduce muscle protein synthesis ; 2 ) TKA induce catabolism attenuate ingestion essential amino acid ( EAA ) ; 3 ) EAA supplementation combination physical therapy ( PT ) stimulate muscle protein synthesis mTOR signal great extent PT Placebo ; 4 ) EAA supplementation TKA PT rehabilitation improve muscle strength , muscle volume functional outcome great extent PT Placebo . Public Benefit : This research focus rehabilitation effort specific currently unresolved mechanism responsible muscle loss follow total knee replacement old adult . While knee pain due bone arthritis often alleviate knee replacement , complete return physical function independence difficult achieve . This research help restore physical function independence rapidly grow population old adult knee arthritis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal translational research project identify key mechanism involve regulate skeletal muscle loss regrowth follow total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . Total knee arthroplasty induces significant decline muscle mass strength , directly responsible reduce function , specifically functional independence . Such decline muscle strength volume activity daily live ( get chair , climb stair walk ) persist 2 year . Atrophy direct result imbalance muscle protein synthesis breakdown . However , two quite distinct mechanism lead muscle loss : accelerate protein breakdown ( e.g . burn injury ) , primarily result stress response , decrease protein synthesis ( e.g. , immobilization ) . In case severe stress , muscle protein synthesis actually increase , although adequately impede muscle loss , anabolic stimulus , nutrition , counteract muscle atrophy . On hand , decrease protein synthesis inactivity stimulate nutrition exercise , thereby reduce prevent atrophy . Currently , know condition predominates follow TKA : surgical stress-induced catabolism immobility-associated decline synthesis . What known signal pathway predominates follow TKA ; stress induce catabolism immobility associate decline synthesis . Our goal determine model ( stress inactivity ) account acute rapid muscle loss follow TKA order well focus rehabilitation effort . Our general hypothesis quadriceps atrophy follow TKA surgery primarily due inactivity , counteract physical therapy ( PT ) essential amino acid ( EAA ) supplementation . Our goal delineate basic mechanism underlie muscle loss TKA , base new information , find novel rehabilitation strategy accelerate recovery normal function TKA . Thus , plan test old adult follow specific hypothesis : 1 . TKA induce acute severe net protein catabolism reduce muscle protein synthesis 2 . TKA induce catabolism attenuate ingestion EAA 3 . EAA supplementation follow PT stimulate muscle protein synthesis mTOR signal great extent PT Placebo 4 . EAA supplementation TKA PT rehabilitation improve muscle strength , muscle volume functional outcome great extent PT Placebo To test specific hypothesis address follow specific aim : 1 . To determine TKA surgery reduces muscle protein synthesis and/or increase muscle protein breakdown 2 . To determine muscle protein synthesis acutely increase ingestion EAA follow TKA surgery 3 . To determine muscle protein synthesis mTOR signal stimulate PT rehabilitation enhance EAA supplementation 4 . To determine EAA supplementation TKA traditional PT 6 week improve muscle strength , muscle volume functional outcome This application provide preliminary data submission R01 grant determine mechanism lead successful return quadriceps muscle strength function follow TKA . Essential amino acid inexpensive , well tolerate easily digestible show independently stimulate muscle protein synthesis component anabolic mTOR signal pathway . My goal increase muscle strength functional mobility specifically outline National Center Medical Rehabilitation Research Seven Priority Areas line NIH roadmap priority , help u understand muscle protein metabolism physical therapy rehabilitation . By adopt mechanism-driven , translational research design link change cell signal functional outcome measure ( cell → system → function ) capture key physiological event responsible regulation muscle mass function follow TKA .</detailed_description>
