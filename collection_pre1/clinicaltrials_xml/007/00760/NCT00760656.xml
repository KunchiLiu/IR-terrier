	<brief_summary>Childhood cancer predispose health risk may become apparent many year completion therapy . The SJLIFE protocol design establish lifetime cohort childhood cancer survivor treat St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital facilitate evaluation health outcome age adult survive pediatric cancer . The study focus follow Primary secondary objective : - To establish lifetime cohort childhood cancer survivor treat St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital facilitate evaluation health outcome age child adult survive pediatric cancer . - To estimate prevalence , cumulative incidence , latency select late treatment complication follow predispose therapeutic exposure child adult survive pediatric cancer . - To identify treatment , genetic , demographic , psychosocial / behavioral related predictor adverse health outcome . - To develop risk profile adverse health outcome across age spectrum guide development clinical screening guideline risk-reducing intervention . - To identify factor may protective development specific late treatment complication . - To generate data series future hypothesis-driven trial - To serve source collection sample child adult volunteer future SJLIFE research . - To collect health outcome data community control population comparison purpose . - Additional Cardiopulmonary Function Testing aim : 1 ) Determine longitudinal change cardiac function , age population adult survivor childhood cancer , expose anthracycline chemotherapy and/or cardiac-directed RT , previously assess 10 year ago ( n=170 ) , currently mean 20 year diagnosis , 29 year age . 2 ) Identify whether myocardial strain provide early detection functional cardiotoxicity ( exercise capacity measure maximum VO2 ) compare ejection fraction adult , standard measure cardiac function utilized current screening strategy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SJLIFE implement progressive stage specific objective permit knowledge gain phase inform content/format/study design subsequent stage . The planned stage study include 1 ) Pre-Recruitment Study , 2 ) Barriers Participation Survey , 3 ) Pilot Study Recruitment Strategies , 4 ) Pilot Studies High-Risk Survivor Cohorts , 5 ) Cross-Sectional Study 10-year survivor , 6 ) Prospective Lifetime Cohort Study . Stage I entail telephone interview random sample potentially eligible survivor obtain subjective feedback regard barrier facilitator SJLIFE recruitment participation . The random sample include thirty alumnus survivor represent broad representation race , gender , attain age , year diagnosis primary diagnostic group . The interview content comprise assessment interest , decision-making factor , barrier participation , current In Stage 2 , Barriers Participation Survey distribute random sample 500 patient representative potentially eligible cohort age , race , sex , geographic distribution , primary diagnosis time diagnosis ; 200 patient randomly select front receive follow-up communication telephone fail return complete survey . Information obtain response questionnaire inform subsequent randomize recruitment trial provide insight regard retention procedure . In Stage 3 , pilot study undertaken ass feasibility potential pitfall recruitment Lifetime Cohort . Introductory letter send 300 alumnus survivor , broad representation across target diagnostic group , invite participation Lifetime Cohort . Recruitment approach informed finding Barriers Participation Survey . Parameters assess related feasibility include 1 ) accuracy contact information hospital system ( need trace potentially eligible research participant ) ; 2 ) number eligible participant actively passively decline study participation ; 3 ) reason decline participation . The pilot study provide insight regard need implementing procedure track potential study participant `` lose follow-up '' incentive recruit retain study participant . In Stage 4 , pilot study undertaken group survivor identify SJLIFE investigator high risk cancer-related morbidity base specific demographic , diagnostic , therapeutic , genetic/familiar factor . In addition utilizing data collect risk-based evaluation perform Cross-Sectional study individual undergo extensive assessment beyond screen recommendation outline COG Guidelines determine frequency thoroughly characterize extent specific treatment complication , well define need study . Knowledge gain pilot study provide important preliminary result use develop proposal extramural funding study identify vulnerable population . In Stage 5 , cross-sectional study cohort 10 year alumnus survivor undertake use risk-based assessment recommend COG Guidelines . The first year study target accrual survivor diagnosis acute lymphoblastic leukemia , Hodgkin lymphoma , acute myeloid leukemia 30 year old . The second year target enrollment survivor central nervous system tumor , Wilms ' tumor bone/soft tissue sarcoma . The third year target accrual remain diagnostic subtypes . The prevalence late treatment complication detect risk-based screening provide important information regard appropriateness COG Guidelines recommendation risk survivor population specific therapeutic exposure . In Stage 6 , information gain evaluation 10-year survivor enrol cohort provide compelling support potential benefit knowledge gain prospective systematic evaluation cohort member . In addition , evaluation participant earlier survivorship ( i.e. , 10 year diagnosis ) perceive enhance opportunity characterize pathophysiology emerge late onset treatment-related toxicity . Therefore , cohort expand change eligibility +10 year survival +18 year age 5+ year cancer diagnosis regardless age . As part expansion SJLIFE study , participant undergo systematic organ function evaluation ( e.g. , echocardiography , pulmonary function testing , audiological testing , ophthalmologic evaluation , bone mineral density test ) . In addition , participant undergo comprehensive psychosocial assessment license social worker receive , need , assistance referral community provider resource ongoing care . In general , survivor evaluation schedule occur within 4 5 year interval . Several activity plan optimize communication participate survivor research activity involve Lifetime Cohort . A newsletter distribute semi-annual basis purpose 1 ) maintain contact periodic mailing ( include address correction request post-office identify individual move last known address may require additional trace re-establish contact ) ; 2 ) provide update status project ; 3 ) maintain enhance relationship participant 4 ) educate survivor select topic health-related importance . In addition , website develop serve resource update progress Lifetime Cohort activity . Adults non-first degree relative friends St. Jude patient former St. Jude patient invited participate control study time child 's St. Jude clinic visit . Employees request study may volunteer SJLIFE study team member supervise SJLIFE study team member . As part SJLIFE initiative group study subject survivor childhood cancer ( community control ) recruit . These control serve comparative group age survivor SJLIFE cohort assess health-related , psychosocial , quality life outcome . Control enrollment protocol expect average 200-300 participant first year ; estimate target accrual 1200 .</detailed_description>
