	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment Mandibular Osteoradionecrosis . A Randomized Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Study objective The objective study evaluate effect hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO ) mandibular osteoradionecrosis adjunctive surgical treatment patient previously irradiate head neck cancer . Hypothesis : Osteoradionecrosis lesion heal frequently administer HBO adjunct surgery . 2 . Introduction rationale Each year , 300 danish patient diagnosed oral cancer . The majority cancer planocellular carcinoma . The established treatment surgery radiation therapy . Depending multiple factor total radiation dose , fractionation , localization use brachytherapy , mandibular osteradionecrosis occur 5-15 % previously head neck irradiated patient . Osteradionecrosis define National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) radiation-induced cell death component bone ( e.g. , marrow fat mineralize tissue ) . It represent final common pathway several disease entity , result impair blood supply bone tissue cause bone necrosis . Often , osteoradionecrosis clinically express relation surgery similar tissue trauma , may also arise spontaneously several year radiation treatment . Oral rehabilitation difficult patient denture wear painful . Furthermore , radiation-induced hyposalivation complicates retention denture , normally retain thin saliva film . As denture wear appear difficult , insertion implant seem obvious patient . However , survival rate dental implant reduce insert irradiated bone . Thus , osteoradionecrosis patient great requirement regard pain therapy well oral functional social rehabilitation . HBO currently offer osteoradionecrosis patient standard treatment combination surgical removal necrotic bone ( sequestrectomy ) . 30 preoperative 10 postoperative treatment session give daily ( weekday ) eight week . The duration treatment session 90 minute involve inhalation 100 % oxygen decompression 15 meter ( 2.5 ATA ) . The decompression lead increase oxygen tension tissue . HBO stimulate monocyte fibroblast proliferation well collagen synthesis irradiate tissue . Also , angiogenesis stimulate , result increase vascularity . Moreover , recent research show HBO induces bone marrow derive progenitor cell previously irradiate human animal . At point , sufficient scientific evidence clinical effect HBO osteoradionecrosis . The majority relevant study casuistic report case-control study participant . Few randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) conduct . Two study document effect HBO , one study include twelve participant , associate sufficient power . The study document prophylactic effect HBO osteoradionecrosis , therefore conclude treatment effect . The author third study conclude , effect HBO treatment . However , study , protocol close full inclusion ( 68 vs. 222 ) , therefore , power may sufficient . Furthermore , study protocol lack accordance standard HBO protocol sufficient description surgical intervention . Moreover , unrealistically high recovery rate control group follow risk draw wrong conclusion . A Cochrane review state sufficient amount data perform meta-analysis . Thus , randomize clinical study need order document whether effect HBO osteoradionecrosis . 3 . Endpoints 3.1 . Primary endpoint The primary endpoint recovery osteoradionecrosis define NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v 3.0 . Recovery define sign osteoradionecrosis accord criterion grade 1 scale . Grade 1 : Asymptomatic , radiographic finding . Grade 2 : Symptomatic interfering function , interfere ADL ( Activities Daily Living , , , ) . Minimal bone removal indicate i.e . minor sequestrectomy ) .. Grade 3 : Symptomatic , interfere ADL . Operative intervention hyperbaric oxygen indicate . Grade 4 : Disabling Grade 5 : Death 3.2 . Secondary endpoint - Life quality ( EORTC scheme QLQ-C30 , QLQ-H &amp; N35 ) - Body Mass Index - Pain intensity ( VAS ) - Analgetics consumption - Antibiotics consumption - Trismus - Xerostomia - Dysphagia - Dental status CTCAE v. 3.0 base clinical well ADL relate criterion . The primary endpoint value obtain fill 21-05 21-06 . The ORN stadium high obtain score . In patient wear denture , denture-related question omit . 4 . Investigational plan 4.1 . Inclusion All patient eligible study ask informed consent protocol responsible person . If patient wish participate study , standard treatment give ( HBO surgery ) . Verbal write information study give preliminary investigation . Randomization occur approximately one week prior participation . 4.1 . Study plan After confirmation study eligibility , participant randomize either group I ( HBO surgery ) group II ( surgery ) . Drug registration perform home 3 month postsurgically . After point , information obtain central register . The study blind , consider unrealistic blind investigator risk 1 ) participant unintentionally mention detail HBO treatment investigator run patient hyperbaric facility . The trial end 114 participant include . Participants withdraw study replace 114 complete participation . A drop-out rate 20-30 % consider likely , mean total , 150 potential participant ask participate order obtain 114 observation . The drop-out The drop-out rate evaluate throughout study . All patient eligible study ask informed consent protocol responsible person . If patient wish participate study , standard treatment give ( HBO surgery ) . Verbal write information study give preliminary investigation . Randomization occur approximately one week prior participation . 5 . Prior participation Prior inclusion , participant examine hyperbaric physician head neck surgeon ensure follow criterion meet . Inclusion criteria 1 . Osteoradionecrosis grade 2 , 3 4 ( CTCAE v 3.0 . ) 2 . Localization : Mandibula 3 . Age &gt; 18 No contraindication hyperbaric oxygen treatment , e.g . emphysema , uncontrolled asthma , epilepsy , previous optic neuritis Exclusion criterion solely apply HBO treatment . Should criteria arise HBO treatment , unnecessary withdraw patient participation . 1 . Malignancy/residual cancer 2 . Previous HBO treatment 3 . Pregnancy lactation ( fertile female participant require use safe anticonception ) 4 . Unmanageable claustrophobia 5 . Undrained pneumothorax 6 . Uncontrollable hypertension blood pressure &gt; 220/110 7 . Explosion titanium reconstruction device 5.2 . Clinical evaluation prior treatment Examination baseline carry use exist HBO examination programme include follow anamnestic registration : § Epilepsy § Lung disease § Heart disease § Diabetes - Psychologic psychiatric disorder ( evaluate need medication HBO ) - Drug list - Use eyeglasses Objective examination § Ability equalize pressure ear sinuses ( otherwise drain ) § Heart lung stetoscopy - Blood pressure - Weight - Pain assessment ( VAS ) 5.3 . Inclusion , randomization stratification . For eligible patient informed consent , DAHANCA 21-inclusion form , checklist inclusion- exclusion criterion fill faxed DAHANCA office : Fax +45 86 19 71 09 . The fax return randomization number treatment regimen . Included patient stratify accord - Gender - ORN stadium 6 . Treatment All patient follow closely treatment . The investigator perform evaluation blind . Since HBO treatment time-consuming ( 8 week ) expensive ( 2000 DKK per session ) , possible , ethically acceptable , include placebo group order conduct study blind participant . 6.1 . Hyperbaric oxygen treatment The patient decompress accord standard profile use clinic . During first five minute , patient decompress 14,5 +/- 0,5 ( 2,45 +/- 0,05 ATA ) stay next 90 minute . Decompression surface ( 0 ) hereafter take place five minute . The patient breathe 100 % oxygen full 100-minute procedure inside hood ( Amron Systems , California , USA ) mask ( Divex Hyperlite II ( Divex Industries , Aberdeen , Scotland ) . Each patient receive 30 preoperative treatment 10 postoperative treatment . 6.2 . Surgical treatment All patient ORN grade &gt; 1 surgically treat accord standardized guideline . The intervention imply either 1 . Resection necrotic bone ( sequestrectomy ) preservation mandibular continuity . 2 . Resection necrotic bone ( sequestrectomy ) loss mandibular continuity . The least mutilating intervention perform . Resection loss continuity perform case potential state fracture . 6.3 . Termination participation Protocol treatment terminate case : The patient wish terminate participation . New indication surgery arise osteoradionecrosis another localization . Other unintentional event occur may impede participation . 7 . Clinical evaluation follow-up 7.1 . One week sequestrectomy The first evaluation occur one week surgery order evaluate wound healing . 7.2 . One month sequestrectomy ( +/- two week ) . 7.3 . Three month sequestrectomy ( +/- three week ) . 7.4 . One year sequestrectomy ( +/- one month ) . 7.5 . After relapse/progression In case relapse progression patient treat accord local guideline . 7.6 Follow-up All patient follow year least 5 year completion participation . Additionally , patient instruct contact department case relapse .</detailed_description>
