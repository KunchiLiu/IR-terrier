	<brief_title>Randomized Study Anular Repair With Xclose Tissue Repair System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Discectomy surgery intend remove impinge fragment nerve root thus alleviate pain provide nerve well heal environment . Discectomy procedures entail remove bony portion vertebral body access posterior side disc space , remove impinge fragment disc . The fragment remove either contain within wall anulus , require incision anulus remove , could extrude anular fissure . In absence safe easy method close seal defect anulus follow discectomy procedure , surgeon leave alternative leave anulus compromise state largely current practice . This rent soft tissue anulus fibrosus lead postoperative problem remain nuclear tissue disc push anular defect incision cause recurrent persistent pain . Initial study involve placement suture seal anular defect . This work strongly suggest microsurgical anular reconstruction reduce recurrent herniation re-operations , post discectomy . Unfortunately , technique easy perform may pose increase risk patient . This study utilize Xclose™ Tissue Repair System re-approximate compromise tissue anulus fibrosus appropriately randomized patient effort quantify benefit anular repair discectomy patient .</detailed_description>
