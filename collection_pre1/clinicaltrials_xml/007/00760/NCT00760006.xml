	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine efficacy administer single dose preoperative antibiotic prevent complication patient undergo primary closure cleave secondary palate . Secondary objective study evaluate effect preoperative antibiotic administer post operative outcome follow primary closure cleave secondary palate . The study aim assess efficacy prophylactic antibiotic cleave surgery - decrease incidence surgical sight infection - speed progression postoperative heal - improve final quality wound heal achieve - decrease rate palatal fistula formation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Antibiotics Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During initial clinical visit , clinical diagnosis cleave secondary palate submucous cleft make . Other associated clinical finding unilateral/bilateral cleft lip , unilateral/bilateral cleft primary palate , Veau cleave palate classification , associate syndromic diagnosis record . The severity cleft palate document measure width cleft hard-soft palate juncture . The patient proceed standardized cleft treatment protocol mandate specific anatomic finding . These include possible naso-alveolar molding , lip-adhesion procedure , cleave lip repair procedure . The patient follow regularly clinic undergo palatoplasty procedure repair cleave secondary palate clinically indicate , typically age 9 14 month . Patients present treatment late operate clinically appropriate , determine plastic surgeon . A Furlow palatoplasty procedure typical palatoplasty procedure perform primary investigator , procedure Von Langenbeck pushback palatoplasty may perform dictated clinical scenario . Subjects randomize via aid statistician Clinical Translational Science Institute ( CTSI ) University Pittsburgh . This enable research pharmacist Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh , send either antibiotic saline placebo operate room blind manner . All subject enrol study receive single dose antibiotic saline solution ( placebo control ) intravenously , IV already place standard card surgery . Subjects receive antibiotic saline placebo 30 minute prior initial incision palatoplasty procedure . The FDA approve antibiotic use study Unasyn . Unasyn first-line measure , use ENT surgeon Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh antibiotic treatment virtually ear , nose throat infection . The use Unasyn study off-label majority antibiotic use child . Subjects receive one time dose 50mg/kg prior surgery , exceed total 2gm . This constitute focus study , variation standard treatment . Patients admitted hospital , discharge home respiratory distress , adequate pain control , able tolerate adequate PO intake . This generally post-operative day 2 . All patient prescribe pain medication . Parents provide , counsel properly use arm splint 14 day postoperatively . They also teach feed child syringe feed . These measure prevent child traumatize suture line bottle , hand foreign body . Screening procedure consist medical history physical examination Pediatric Plastic Surgeon determine type cleft palate repair necessary . This standard exam medical/surgical work-up patient would receive treat Cleft-Craniofacial Clinic Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh UPMC enrol study . This aspect care vary routine treatment . All patient see weekly postoperative follow-up Cleft-Craniofacial Center . Documentation postoperative visit include notation sign surgical sight infection , continue fever , erythema , swell , discharge , dehiscence , pain , presence nonviable tissue . The progression wound heal quantify scale 1 4 . Wounds classify Stage 1 heal complete union mucosa , irregularity separation . Stage 2 healing document wound minor incisional irregularity incomplete heal . Stage 3 healing document wound exhibit worrisome mucosal viability , partial dehiscence oral mucosal closure , erythema , purulent drainage , exposure alloderm patch . Stage 4 heal include patient palatal fistula . Any patient clinical sign symptom thrush , fungal infection mouth esophagus , culture lesion send confirm diagnosis . These patient immediately start seven day course oral fluconazole , initial dose 6mg/kg , follow daily dose 3mg/kg , recommend Dr. Andrew Nowalk , MD . Patients see clinic weekly reach stage 1 healing , presence palatal fistula document . We anticipate minimum less 2 month maximum 1 year follow-up necessary document either stage 1 heal presence palatal fistula nearly case . The primary endpoint measure 1 ) incidence surgical sight infection , 2 ) incidence palatal fistula 3 ) average time need achieve stage 1 healing , 4 ) incidence case heal delay one standard deviation average , 5 ) incidence thrush , fungal infection mouth esophagus , 6 ) incidence allergic/drug reaction study drug . Surveillance factor hospital length stay , postoperative bleeding event , postoperative respiratory distress , diagnosis sepsis record secondary endpoint . Data collection include patient characteristic , limited , Veau cleave classification , width cleft defect , presence associate cleft lip primary palate , presence syndromic diagnosis , use alloderm repair augmentation , administration intraoperative steroid . The two study group compare basis characteristic determine statistically significant difference exist two group . Endpoint data collect discussed , outcomes placebo antibiotic group compare .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children diagnose cleft palate undergo palatoplasty age 3 month 18 year include study . Palatoplasty current standard care sequence treatment cleave secondary palate . Pediatric plastic surgeon work primarily child , undergone extensive training residency pediatric surgical fellowship . Children evaluate initially CleftCraniofacial Center Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh UPMC , set accommodate child age family . Approximately 300 child require contribute meaningful analysis . All patient require prophylactic antibiotic spontaneous bacterial endocarditis , document allergic reaction ampicillinsulbactam , know immunodeficiency immunodeficiency associate syndrome , 22q chromosomal deletion , exclude study participation . Selection base parent 's willingness allow child participate study . Children already receive antibiotic time surgery evaluate distinctly , though include antibiotic placebo group</criteria>
