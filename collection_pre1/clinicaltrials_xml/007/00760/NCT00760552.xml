	<brief_summary>The long-range goal research advance understand long-term blood pressure ( BP ) control patient uncontrolled hypertension ( HTN ) . The work build experience implement new model care Veterans Affairs ( VA ) non-VA setting , include three National Institute Health ( NIH ) study pharmacist-based HTN management . The long-term effectiveness model , especially veteran , unknown . Thus , primary goal study evaluate sustain long-term BP control veterans HTN follow 6-month intensive pharmacist intervention . This study enroll veteran uncontrolled HTN 6-month intensive pharmacist-based intervention . Following initial intervention , participant randomize continued intervention one-time patient provider education intervention . BP compare two group 2-year follow-up period . The intervention control sustain BP follow VA guideline include : 1 ) comprehensive medication assessment pharmacist ; 2 ) explicit plan intensify treatment indicate ; 3 ) strategy improve adherence ; 4 ) follow-up pharmacist visit sustain BP control . The intervention base model identify recent Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) report potent strategy improve BP . The study benefit strong research team expertise guideline development , implementation science , quality measurement , behavioral science . The study also provide important information degree BP control deteriorate patient refer back usual care . The specific aim relate hypothesis study : Aim 1 : Compare BP control patient randomize long-term continuation pharmacist intervention less intense one-time patient provider education intervention . Hypothesis 1a : Patients randomize continued pharmacist intervention high rate BP control 24 month randomization . Hypothesis 1b : Patients randomize continued pharmacist intervention lower mean BP 24 month randomization . Aim 2 : Compare antihypertensive medication intensification patient randomize continued pharmacist intervention less intense intervention . Hypothesis 2 : A high proportion patient continue pharmacist intervention medication intensification 24-month follow-up . Aim 3 : Compare medication adherence two intervention group . Hypothesis 3a : Medication adherence high patient randomize continued pharmacist intervention group 24 month follow-up period . Hypothesis 3b : Improvements medication adherence associate improvement BP study interval .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Low High Intensity Strategies Maintain BP Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose 4-year trial determine long-term blood pressure ( BP ) control pharmacist intervention require continuation intervention less intense strategy equally efficacious . The intervention build Chronic Care Model , recent Veteran Affairs ( VA ) trial , pharmacist intervention . This research convincingly show collaborative intervention improve BP control 6-9 month . However , randomize study evaluate strategy sustain effect intervention . The study enroll 300 patient uncontrolled HTN Iowa City Veteran Affairs Medical Center ( VAMC ) affiliate community base outpatient clinic ( CBOC ) . All patient receive pharmacist intervention 6 month follow VA HTN guideline . Patients complete intervention randomize continuation high intensity intervention one-time patient provider education intervention recently show effective . The high intensity ( HI ) intervention intensify medication regimen BP deteriorates , sustain adherence , improve monitoring reduce adverse drug reaction . The low intensity ( LI ) intervention involve usual care patient primary care provider ( PCPs ) one-time education intervention include letter emphasize importance medication adherence behavioral strategy improve BP control ( e.g. , low-salt diet , exercise ) . PCPs low intensity patient also receive computerized alert treatment recommendation link BP guideline . The primary endpoint-BP-will assess use standard measurement 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 month post enrollment ( 24 month randomization ) . The 24-month evaluation phase determine BP control sustain improve continued high intensity intervention , relative low intensity intervention ( Aim 1 ) . All medication change assess compare rate medication intensification follow-up period ( Aim 2 ) . Finally , validate self-report adherence questionnaire use compare medication adherence two group determine relationship BP control medication adherence ( Aim 3 ) .</detailed_description>
