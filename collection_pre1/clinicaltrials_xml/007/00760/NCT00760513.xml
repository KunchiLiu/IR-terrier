	<brief_summary>Non alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) impose high increase burden NHS , yet presently license treatment validate approach management . NAFLD predispose increase risk type 2 diabetes , increase risk cardiovascular disease may progress chronic irreversible liver disease . In NAFLD patient , investigator test hypothesis treatment long chain n-3 fatty acid supplementation 18 month favourably influence bio-markers NAFLD risk factor cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease With n-3 Fatty Acids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We recruit people NAFLD diagnose part NHS care condition . At present treatment condition . Over time proportion people NAFLD . Purpose design We ask research question ' Does treatment purify long chain n-3 fatty acid ( purified fish oil ) improve non alcoholic fatty liver disease risk factor heart disease type 2 ( adult ) diabetes strongly link liver condition ? ' Presently treatment liver condition . Research evidence suggest purify long chain n-3 fatty acid might beneficial condition . To address research question want undertake randomise double blind placebo control trial recruiting people diagnose liver biopsy liver condition . A protocol change approve course study October 2011 . In protocol , delete information regard liver biopsy offer end study . Having collate volunteer opinion local consultant opinion , whereas high proportion volunteer happy undergo follow liver biopsy , local hepatologists consider 2011 , small risk morbidity mortality volunteer undergo liver biopsy unacceptable , within context research study . Their opinion change since 2008 initial LREC approval grant . Liver biopsy always optional extra would undertake subgroup volunteer . Therefore , removal liver biopsy protocol affect validity study test effect n-3 fatty acid intervention biomarkers liver fat people non alcoholic fatty liver disease . Besides removal liver biopsy protocol , clarify protocol , end point study number randomise either n-3 fatty acid placebo ( n=100 , always intend ) . We also make clear amendment measurement liver fat also primary outcome study . ( We already permission undertake test uncertain study approve would sufficient funding expensive test originally primary outcome ) . We therefore add power calculation ( cite relevant literature ) show sample size n=100 people , base upon know treatment effect n-3 fatty acid liver fat , acceptable power detect predict decrease outcome treatment .</detailed_description>
