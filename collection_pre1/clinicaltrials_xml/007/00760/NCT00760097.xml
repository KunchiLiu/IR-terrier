	<brief_summary>People depression often symptoms besides sad mood . Cognitive symptom , poor memory , concentration , decision making , associate disability many sphere life , symptom often persist even antidepressant treatment improve symptom ( mood , energy , sleep , anxiety ) . Antidepressants alone fail produce full remission many patient , important study adjunctive treatment add onto medication treatment help restore cognitive function . The method transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) show others improve work memory cognitive function , also help symptom depression . tDCS involve pass small , constant current saline-moistened pad place scalp . In proposed study , 20 individual major depression cognitive difficulty despite take antidepressant participate . Over course two-week period , person receive 5 session either active tDCS inactive treatment , addition medication . Each session last 20 minute , administer alternating day ( M-W-F ) . Assessments depressive symptom , cognitive function , brain activity make prior session , first one , fifth ( final ) session ; brain function assess measure brain 's electrical activity ( `` brain wave '' ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , also sometimes term `` DC polarization '' `` brain polarization , '' non-invasive procedure use successfully therapeutic intervention number patient population . tDCS involve pass weak current area interest brain , place electrode scalp appropriate location . DC polarization show alter amplitude evoked potential visual cortex ( Antal et al. , 2004 ) , cortical processing parietal lobe also modulate tDCS ( Rogalewski et al. , 2004 ) . From physiologically-relevant perspective , tDCS motor cortex show improve motor function patient follow stroke ( Hummel Cohen , 2005 ; Hummel et al. , 2006 ; Boggio et al. , 2006b ) apply prefrontal cortex . tDCS show improve work memory healthy individual ( Fregni et al. , 2005b ) , individual major depressive episode . In MDD recently show improve depression rating self-report score ( Fregni et al. , 2006a ) cognitive performance ( Fregni et al. , 2006b ) . Performance executive function task ( go/no-go ) also show enhanced tDCS adult MDD ( Boggio et al. , 2006a ) . tDCS evaluate subject Parkinson 's disease find therapeutic benefit ( compare inactive treatment ) Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale neuropsychological measure ( reaction time , pegboard task ) well motor evoke potential ( Fregni et al. , 2006c ) . Several recent study affirm safety tDCS . Iyer colleague ( 2005 ) show , sample 103 subject , one ask tDCS procedure stop due discomfort . Gandiga colleague ( 2006 ) compare sham active tDCS show difference self-report rating discomfort . Nitsche colleague ( 2004 ) perform structural MRI scan healthy individual underwent 1 hour exposure tDCS ; find evidence structural change brain alteration blood-brain barrier permeability . With regard persistent challenge management MDD , individual depression show cognitive deficit , particularly work memory frontal lobe function ( Dunkin et al. , 2000 ; Sweeney et al. , 2000 Jaeger et al. , 2006 ; Rose Ebmeier 2006 ; Rose et al. , 2006 ) declarative memory ( e.g. , Beaden et al. , 2006 ) . By improve cognitive function subject cognitive complaint persist despite pharmacotherapy , may possible improve completeness recovery depression reduce functional disability ( Jaeger et al. , 2006 ) . There publish report yet effect tDCS brain function subject MDD . Cordance quantitative electroencephalography ( QEEG ) measure allow non-invasive measurement regional brain function ( Leuchter et al. , 1994a , 1994b , 1999 ; Cook et al. , 1998 ) . It sensitive change brain function subject respond treatment MDD ( Cook Leuchter 2001 ; Cook et al. , 2002 , 2005 ; Leuchter et al. , 2002 ) evaluate use biomarker predict treatment outcome MDD ( NIMH Project R01MH069217 , Cook PI ) . It well suit evaluate brain function subject MDD clinical trial experiment . Our hypothesis 1 . Subjects randomize receive active tDCS treatment show great improvement cognitive task performance subject receive inactive treatment . 2 . Subjects randomize receive active tDCS treatment show great improvement depression symptom severity score subject receive inactive treatment . 3 . Subjects randomize receive active tDCS treatment show great change prefrontal brain function , assess quantitative EEG cordance , subject receive inactive treatment .</detailed_description>
