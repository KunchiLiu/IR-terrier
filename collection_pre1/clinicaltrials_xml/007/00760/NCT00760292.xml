	<brief_summary>Background : Genetic risk-markers associate T2DM thoroughly study . So far , genetic variant , also term single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP 's ) , replicate several study give limited explanation grow incidence T2DM . The hypothesis present study determination combination genetic variant SNP-chip technology may improve prediction T2DM , complication efficacy treatment compare method previously use include genome wide association ( GWA ) study . The SNP-chip/ DNA microarray make possible study several SNP 's association T2DM , one one also combination . Aims : To study whether specific genetic variant , combination , 1 ) present high prevalence patient T2DM normal population , 2 ) associate specific diabetes-related complication 3 ) effect anti-diabetic treatment . Methods : During next three year 1000 patient T2DM 1000 healthy , non-diabetic person include study , examine blood sample , questionnaire clinical evaluation , one visit . Initially , perform DNA analysis blood sample 372 patient include another clinical study department . Description genetics do DNA-chip approximately 70 SNP 's , previously report associated T2DM . Results conclusion : It expect result project help u predict T2DM , diabetes-related complication individualize treatment individual patient T2DM .</brief_summary>
