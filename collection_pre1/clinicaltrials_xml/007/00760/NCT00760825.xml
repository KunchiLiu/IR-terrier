	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity Bivalent Killed Whole Cell Oral Cholera Vaccine Adults Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Provision safe water food , establishment adequate sanitation , implementation personal community hygiene constitute main public health intervention cholera . These measure implement fully near future cholera-endemic area . Improvements water sanitation require substantial long-term investment , commitment local government , often take year implement . In meantime , safe , effective affordable vaccine would useful tool cholera prevention control . Considerable progress make last decade development new generation oral vaccine cholera . These already licensed country consider wider public health application . Cholera immunization recommend traveler high risk area , refugee camp outbreak response . Furthermore , expand use cholera vaccine may recommend endemic area , increase demand low- middle-income population . Starting mid-1980s , follow technology transfer Prof Jan Holmgren , Vietnamese scientist National Institute Hygiene Epidemiology ( NIHE ) Hanoi develop produce oral , kill cholera vaccine country 's public health program . A two-dose regimen first generation monovalent ( anti-O1 ) cholera vaccine produce US $ 0.10 per dose underwent field trial Hue , Vietnam . The study formally randomize : vaccine assign basis systematic allocation scheme control group receive placebo . The calculated efficacy El Tor cholera 66 % fully immunize adult child . Protection non-cholera assess none find suggest non-biased study design . Subsequently , kill 0139 whole cell add Vietnamese vaccine due emergence new form epidemic cholera cause serogroup . A study find bivalent vaccine safe immunogenic adult child one year older . The Vietnamese vaccine several distinct advantage Swedish vaccine . The Vietnamese vaccine confers protection El Tor biotype young child . And price US $ 0.10 per dose feasible public health program develop country , Swedish vaccine prohibitively expensive . Finally , administer without buffer , Swedish vaccine require buffer strict cold chain requirement . Since licensure oral cholera vaccine Vietnam , 9 million dos administer without report serious adverse event . The vaccine produce accord recommend guideline Company Vaccine Biological Production No . 1 ( VABIOTECH ) Hanoi . VABIOTECH work towards WHO Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP ) certification , hope receive next year . At time , IVI VABIOTECH work internationalize Vietnamese vaccine global use . In order comply WHO requirement , vaccine reformulate . Phase II trial reformulate killed oral cholera vaccine perform SonLa , Vietnam Kolkata , India vaccine find safe serious adverse reaction associate vaccine . The vaccine elicit significant vibriocidal antibody responses among vaccinee . In SonLa , 90 % adult recipient seroconverted V. cholerae O1 follow receipt two dos vaccine . In Kolkata , 53 % adult 80 % child age 1-17 year develop 4-fold great rise vibriocidal antibody V. cholerae O1 . Data Vietnam India suggest great magnitude vibriocidal response follow 2 dos vaccine elicit compare previous formulation . It suggest response may correlate high lipopolysaccharide content vaccine , result change standardization . A phase III trial vaccine currently underway Wards 29 , 30 , 33 Kolkata , India . Since trial still ongoing , data regard adverse event still analyze . As yet serious adverse reaction directly attribute vaccine . Surveillance continue area determine efficacy vaccine . Through agreement negotiate IVI , VABIOTECH produce bulk reformulate bivalent vaccine quality condition supervise IVI . Shantha Biotechnics India fill finish bulk , obtain regulatory clearance use vaccine Phase II III trial India . In return , technology future production oral kill bivalent cholera vaccine transfer Shantha Biotechnics .</detailed_description>
