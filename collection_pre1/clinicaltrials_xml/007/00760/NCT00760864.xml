	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy TAK-715 Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis affect approximately 1 % adult population , chronic , progressive disease characterize synovial inflammation . The result inflammation lead destruction synovium surround joint tissue , result cartilage destruction , bone erosion resultant loss joint function . It autoimmune disorder unknown etiology typically affect joint hand , wrist , knee , foot , usually bilateral pattern . Symptoms experience early disease process include pain , swell , tenderness affect joint . As disease progress , many patient experience joint stiffness , weakness , fatigue , anorexia , weight loss , ultimately tissue damage joint destruction . The severity symptoms varies widely , range annoyance debilitation . Rheumatoid arthritis disease primarily afflict adult , woman affect often men . Because rheumatoid arthritis chronic destructive , require early diagnosis aggressive treatment minimize morbidity associate progression , lead deterioration physical function psychological social well-being . The objective rheumatoid arthritis therapy reduce inflammation decrease progression articular damage . Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug use accomplish objective . During past several year , rheumatologists become increasingly aggressive initiate treatment disease-modifying antirheumatic drug early course rheumatoid arthritis attempt prevent joint destruction . The gold standard therapy methotrexate , show efficacious safe , appear remain effective , even many year treatment . However , patient respond methotrexate , even patient respond frequently partial response ( reduced sign symptom , still active disease ) . As result , many patient treat 2 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug time . More recently , biologics ( biotechnology drug ) introduce armamentarium rheumatoid arthritis , base improve understanding role proinflammatory mediator , TNF-alpha , interleukin-1 , interleukin-6 rheumatoid arthritis . Etanercept ( Enbrel® ) , soluble TNF-alpha type II receptor-human immunoglobulin fusion protein administer subcutaneously twice week , infliximab ( Remicade® ) , chimeric human mouse monoclonal antibody TNF-alpha , administer intravenously every 4 8 week along weekly methotrexate , adalimumab ( Humira® ) , human-derived recombinant immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody , administer subcutaneously every week , currently available treatment rheumatoid arthritis . They demonstrate rapid substantial improvement rheumatoid arthritis , presumably prevent action TNF-alpha joint , thereby reduce inflammatory destructive consequence TNF-alpha . Etanercept infliximab grant Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve indication reduce sign symptom , inhibit progression structural damage improve physical function patient moderately severely active rheumatoid arthritis . Adalimumab grant FDA approve indication reduce sign symptom inhibit progression structural damage , Anakinra ( Kineret® ) , interleukin-1 receptor antagonist administer subcutaneously daily , receive FDA approval reduce sign symptom . TAK-715 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor show nonclinical study decrease proinflammatory cytokine production , specifically tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) , interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 . These cytokine think pivotal mediator inflammation resultant joint destruction rheumatoid arthritis . TAK-715 also show inhibit production cyclooxygenase-2-mediated prostanoids nitric oxide well oppose differentiation osteoclast , contributes joint damage associate rheumatoid arthritis . Individuals participate study provide write informed consent require commit screen visit approximately 5 additional visit study center . Study participation anticipate 6 month . Multiple procedures occur visit may include fasting , blood collection , urine collection , physical examination electrocardiograms . Participants require provide detailed medical history relate rheumatoid arthritis complete multiple questionnaire .</detailed_description>
