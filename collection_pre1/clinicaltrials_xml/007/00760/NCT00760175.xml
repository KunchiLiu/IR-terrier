	<brief_summary>The influenza virus , commonly call flu , common source infection lung transplant patient often lead pneumonia possibly rejection . The annual influenza vaccine important strategy use prevent infection effective lung transplant patient . It think response vaccine may improve give skin ( intradermal ) rather muscle ( intramuscular ) . We hypothesize significantly great proportion patient respond vaccination use intradermal influenza vaccine compare intramuscular vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The annual influenza vaccine suggest immunocompromised patient . However , immunogenic response vaccine suboptimal range 15-70 % . In lung transplant recipient , response influenza vaccine poor organ transplant group . For example , study 43 stable lung transplant recipient show protective antibody develop 19 % , 30 % , 40 % three antigen vaccine ( 8.6 % subject develop protective antibody level three ) . Similarly , 43 % respond single dose vaccine give 68 lung transplant recipient ; response significantly low mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) . We recently publish study 60 lung transplant recipient standard influenza vaccine immunogenic least one vaccine antigen approximately 60 % patient . The study propose prospective randomize control trial design assess immunogenicity influenza vaccine give intradermally compare standard intramuscular vaccine lung transplant recipient . Lung transplant recipient unique vaccine response lowest organ group stand benefit alternate vaccine strategy . CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY Lung transplant recipient appear one poor humoral response influenza vaccination organ transplant group . However , influenza remain important cause morbidity population protection imperative . The current vaccine suboptimal newer strategy need studied increase response rate . This subject area critical importance study especially light threat pandemic influenza . OBJECTIVE AND HYPOTHESIS - To test specific humoral cellular response intradermal influenza vaccine . - To test safety intradermal influenza vaccine lung transplant population . - We hypothesize significantly great proportion patient respond vaccination use intradermal influenza vaccine compare intramuscular vaccine .</detailed_description>
