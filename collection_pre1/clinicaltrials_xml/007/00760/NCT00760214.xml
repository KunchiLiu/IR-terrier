	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Azilsartan Medoxomil Compared Ramipril Treating Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major component blood pressure regulation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system , system hormone-mediated feedback interaction result relaxation constriction blood vessel response various stimulus . Angiotensin II , polypeptide hormone , form angiotensin I reaction catalyze angiotensin-converting enzyme part renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . Angiotensin II principal pressor agent renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system myriad effect cardiovascular system electrolyte homeostasis . Two receptor angiotensin II identify . Angiotensin II type 1 receptor locate predominantly vascular smooth muscle , activation angiotensin II result vasoconstriction , hypertrophic proliferation , inflammation . In contrast , stimulation angiotensin II type 2 receptor angiotensin II result vasodilatation , antiproliferative effect opposite angiotensin II type 1 receptor stimulation . Drugs modulate renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system use commonly worldwide treatment hypertension . Of , block synthesis angiotensin II inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme , others inhibit action angiotensin II bind directly angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( call angiotensin II receptor blocker ) , thereby cause vasodilatation blood vessel , result reduction blood pressure . The effect angiotensin II receptor blocker condition renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system play significant role , congestive heart failure , postmyocardial infarction management diabetic nephropathy also investigate . Although antihypertensive agent effective appropriate dose , majority side effect limit use . Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor commonly associate cough rarely angioedema . Beta-blockers associated fatigue erectile dysfunction , calcium antagonist peripheral edema diuretic metabolic complication . As class , angiotensin II receptor blocker generally consider tolerable class hypertensive agent , although still need compound improve tolerability efficacy treatment hypertension . TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) angiotensin II receptor blocker high affinity , selective antagonistic activity , angiotensin II type 1 receptor , develop clinical use antihypertensive agent . Ramipril angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor widely prescribe Europe Asia treatment mild moderate essential hypertension . This study design compare efficacy safety/tolerability azilsartan medoxomil ramipril treatment hypertension . Participants study see twice first month , month five month . Participants also require fast 8 hour prior visit study center . Total duration study participation 24-weeks , plus safety follow phone call study end .</detailed_description>
