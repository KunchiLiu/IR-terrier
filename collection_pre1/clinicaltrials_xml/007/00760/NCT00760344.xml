	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety SYR-472 Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus complex metabolic disorder characterize abnormal insulin secretion glucose homeostasis , result impaired pancreatic beta-cell function insulin resistance target tissue . The worldwide prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus reach epidemic proportion , total number case expect reach 221 million 2010 . The high incidence disease associate complication place significant burden healthcare system . The primary risk factor development type 2 diabetes mellitus obesity associate insulin resistance . Insulin resistance characterize impaired response physiologic effect insulin lead decrease cellular glucose uptake , increase hepatic gluconeogenesis , compensatory increase insulin secretion contribute beta-cell exhaustion . Therefore insulin-resistant state , blood glucose insulin level increase . The relationship improved glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes mellitus delay prevention comorbidities report Diabetes Control Complications Trial United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study . Therefore , reduction persistent hyperglycemia high priority treat disease . Diet exercise important effective measure maintain glycemic control individual insulin resistance , impair glucose tolerance , type 2 diabetes mellitus , particularly early stage disease progression . In case diet exercise alone fail adequately maintain glycemic control , oral antidiabetic drug typically use . Combination oral therapy eventually insulin usually require maintain lower blood glucose level result adverse effect include hypoglycemia weight gain . Therefore , novel safe effective antidiabetic therapy need . Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ubiquitous aminopeptidase widely express many tissue ; think primarily responsible vivo degradation least two gut-derived incretin hormone , namely glucagon-like peptide-1 glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide , release response nutrient ingestion . Glucagon-like peptide-1 demonstrated augment glucose-dependent insulin secretion ; suppress glucagon release hepatic gluconeogenesis ; inhibit gastric emptying , reduce appetite food intake . Glucagon-like peptide-1 glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide also show promote insulin biosynthesis stimulate beta cell proliferation survival . Orally available inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity develop increase intact postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 level oral administration . SYR-472 selective inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 development improve glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . The aim study evaluate SYR-472 subject type 2 diabetes mellitus previously achieve adequate glycemic control lifestyle modification ( diet/exercise ) metformin antidiabetic monotherapy . Study participation anticipate 20 week .</detailed_description>
