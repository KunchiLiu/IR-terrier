	<brief_title>Infliximab Plus Intravenous Immunoglobulin Primary Treatment Kawasaki Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>KD , orphan disease low prevalence U.S. child , cause significant long term cardiac sequela subset patient . KD patient resistant therapy likely develop coronary artery abnormality . This phase III placebo-controlled , multicenter , randomize clinical trial infliximab plus standard therapy vs. placebo plus standard therapy acute KD determine addition infliximab primary therapy reduce percentage child resistant therapy .</detailed_description>
