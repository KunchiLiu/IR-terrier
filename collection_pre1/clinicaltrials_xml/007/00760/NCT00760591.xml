	<brief_summary>Oral phosphate purgative preferred bowel regimen basis well tolerability , cost effectiveness , efficacy . There also numerous report patient even previously normal renal function develop acute chronic kidney disease use oral phosphate purgative . Several uncontrolled case report case series suggest potential link oral phosphate acute kidney injury and/or chronic kidney disease1 . Its use contraindicate patient preexist renal disease risk develop acute renal failure , call acute phosphate nephropathy , electrolyte disturbance . Since outpatient go undergo colonoscopy expose agent , important detect prevent vulnerable patient . We would seek sensitive rapid diagnosis method acute kidney injury follow sodium phosphate bowel preparation . Within hour , NGAL mRNA highly upregulated kidney injury , renal ischemia-reperfusion cisplatin nephropathy , NGAL induction precedes elevation classical marker kidney damage serum creatinine . The investigator investigate change NGAL follow sodium phosphate bowel preparation .</brief_summary>
