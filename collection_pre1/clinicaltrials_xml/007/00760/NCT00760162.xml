	<detailed_description>Probiotics increasingly utilized clinically . As safety health benefit establish , reasonable anticipate probiotic bacteria incorporate grow number clinical regimen . Following exploratory test orally administer probiotic bacteria rat minipigs surgically induce chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , trial progress determine whether daily treatment gastrointestinal ( GI ) probiotic bacteria delay onset and/or improve establish sign symptom human CKD . To assess potential benefit devise gut-based probiotic formulation ( Kibow Biotics速 ) dieatary supplement - Over The Counter ( OTC ) product CKD application . Extensive vitro R &amp; D investigation Kibow 's laboratory Simulated Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem ( SHIME , Ghent University , Belgium ) utilize computer-controlled vitro system validate concept choose microbial formulation would metabolize reduce concentration nitrogenous component include urea , creatinine , uric acid . Bacterial strain study Streptococcus thermophilus ( KB27 ) , Lactobacillus acidophilus ( KB31 ) Bifidobacterium longum ( KB35 ) . Oral administration bacterial formulation , test 5/6th nephrectomized rat model ( Thomas Jefferson University , Phila. , PA ) minipig model ( Indiana University , Indianapolis , IN ) , decrease blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) serum creatinine ( Scr ) level .
