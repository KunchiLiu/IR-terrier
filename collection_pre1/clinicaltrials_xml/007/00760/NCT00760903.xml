	<brief_summary>The purpose study use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) ass traumatic brain injury determine correlation finding clinical outcome . MR spectroscopy use 2D-CSI ( multi voxel technique ) corpus callosum , basal ganglion , lobar white matter brainstem may reveal area injury quantification metabolite area may use correlate imaging finding clinical evaluation . White matter disruption area commonly see TBI , cause diffuse axonal injury . It implicate long term outcomes patient , difficult assess standard radiologic study . By use DTI may possible demonstrate damage white matter tract could helpful evaluation traumatic brain injury . Most TBI subject injury involve torque brain . This result shear injury long white matter tract , hypothesize related cognitive outcome . Also , demonstrate MRS DTI prove valuable predicting outcome patient moderate brain trauma conduct progressive study acutely ( within 24 hour ) long term ( 4-6 week ) . Most patient likely follow clinically year , , clinical indicate , far scan do later date . By compare fraction anisotropy , ADC value , metabolic ratio use DTI MRS adult pediatric population , may help assess difference recovery . Lastly , comparison two group change brain metabolism and/or white matter tract disruption/re-connection TBI and/or without link outcome do .</brief_summary>
