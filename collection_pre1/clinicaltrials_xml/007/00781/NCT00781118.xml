	<detailed_description>There one million acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) year United States 400,000 result death . Early identification AMI , prompt treatment show significantly improve clinical outcome . Experimental clinical study show irreversible damage myocardium occur first two hour coronary occlusion . Milavetz et al . demonstrate successful reperfusion therapy within two hour associate great degree myocardial salvage . According Boersma , et al. , restoration flow , regardless method use , abort infarction within first 30 minute coronary occlusion , benefit fibrinolytic therapy compare placebo considerably high patient treat within 2 hour symptom onset treat later.2 Further , evidence exists expeditious restoration flow obstruct infarct artery onset symptom patient severe type MI , ST elevation MI ( STEMI ) key determinant short long-term outcome regardless whether reperfusion accomplish fibrinolysis percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Therefore , early arrival hospital reliable diagnosis initiation treatment paramount improve outcome myocardial infarction . However , despite effort educate public past decade , mean time AMI symptom onset arrival hospital treatment remain , disappointingly , 2.5-3.0 hour . The large proportion total pre-hospital delay interval onset symptom decision seek medical treatment . Finnegan et al . describe reason delay seek medical evaluation generally stem patient misconception symptom experience , expectation , attribution . In many case , patient expect type heart attack often see movie television : kind crush chest pain drop person ground . The reality many heart attack much `` quieter , '' cause mild chest pain discomfort symptom shortness breath diaphoresis . If patient would take action first hour follow symptom onset , many life significant cost could save . It technically possible monitor EKGs detect acute infarction , even patient unaware experience heart attack . However , currently available system limitation home environment . Twelve lead EKG system require clinically train individual place . Holter monitor suffer limitation ability detect ST deviation due low compliance limit practice 24 72 hour monitor . Systems use surface lead subject noise artifacts patient movement body orientation , particularly patient ambulatory . A potentially ideal solution implant device measure heart signal inside heart alert patient detects electrogram characteristic set physician worthy medical evaluation .</detailed_description>
