	<brief_summary>Osteonecrosis hip important cause musculoskeletal disability find therapeutic solution proven challenge . Osteonecrosis mean death bone occur loss blood supply mean . Although age group may develop osteonecrosis , patient 20 50 year old . The common risk factor history high steroid treatment medical condition . The next common associate condition history high alcohol use . There case osteonecrosis occur patient otherwise completely healthy detectable risk factor . In early stage disease , x-rays appear normal diagnosis make use MRI . The advanced stage osteonecrosis begin dead bone start fail mechanically process microfractures bone . As disease progress , surface begin collapse , finally integrity joint destroy . A wide range surgical treatment variable success rate propose treatment osteonecrosis preserve joint integrity , include core decompression , whereby venous hypertension ensues lessen revascularisation may induce lead bone repair . Nonsurgical treatment option limit usually result poor prognosis . Early stage disease treat protected weight bearing physiotherapy , however study show protected weight bearing associate great 85 % rate femoral head collapse . Unfortunately study indicate risk disease progression great nonsurgical treatment surgical intervention . There establish pharmaceutical prevention treatment osteonecrosis . Evidence increase nitrogen contain bisphosphonates may beneficial treatment osteonecrosis . One bisphosphonates ( alendronate ) evaluate 60 patient diagnosed osteonecrosis hip . Recent clinical study show promising result . All patient symptomatic improvement one year . Although follow time range 3 month 5 year , 6 patient progressed point need surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteonecrosis ( ON ) hip important cause musculoskeletal disability find therapeutic solution proven challenge . Patients affect ON often relatively young , usually third sixth decade life . ON hip increasingly common cause musculoskeletal disability . It cause pain without loss function joint often end substantial use health care resource disability . ON hip usually progress severe destruction femoral head resultant degeneration hip joint , case require joint replacement . Early diagnosis make easier use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , however common satisfactory therapy develop early stage disease . Early surgery aim preserve femoral head propose , vascularised fibula grafting . However , result invasive technique seem widely reproducible , minor intervention core drilling high failure rate . Evidence increase nitrogen contain bisphosphonates may beneficial treatment ON . Data clinical trial patient ON hip suggest bisphosphonate alendronate would reduce pain disability may reduce progression femoral head collapse usually would require surgical intervention . With study aim determine efficacy bisphosphonate therapy ( zoledronic acid ) versus placebo reduce pain disability ON femoral head necrosis ( palliative endpoint ) investigate effect bisphosphonate therapy versus placebo reduce progression femoral head collapse need surgical intervention ( therapeutic endpoint ) . Methods This 2-armed double-blind randomised trial ) zoledronic acid 5mg annually 3 dos b ) placebo drug infusion . Participants recruit primarily rheumatologists orthopaedic surgeon multiple centre Australia . We plan include 4 major centre capital city Australia centre would recruit approximately 30 participant . Potential participant meet eligibility criterion identify treat Rheumatologists Orthopaedic surgeon , follow screening assessment conduct study research staff . Eligible participant randomise prior start treatment . Prior treatment , study research staff perform baseline assessment phone , include demographic detail , age , sex , duration symptom , medical history include prior surgery , trauma medication use know risk factor ON . Furthermore baseline , Rheumatologists Orthopaedic surgeon perform clinical evaluation use slightly modify Harris Hip Score ( HHS ) . The study research staff contact participant every 6 month monitor participant 's condition evaluate pain disability . Additionally participants clinical evaluation MRI scan 12 month . This novel clinical research protocol aim provide evidence protective value alendronate zoledronic acid patient ON hip . It determine whether bisphosphonates slow progression symptom well progression total collapse hip . Additionally seek answer question regard comparative effectiveness also cost-effectiveness use bisphosphonates early disease . The result study lead change treatment early disease ON delay possibly prevent surgical intervention .</detailed_description>
