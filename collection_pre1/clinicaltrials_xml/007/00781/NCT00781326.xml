	<brief_title>Effectiveness Nimodipine Plus Antidepressant Medication Treating Vascular Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depressed elderly patient often show sign cerebrovascular disease , commonly know stroke . Some scientist theorize cerebrovascular disease may affect depression old adult one three way : causing depression , make likely people depress relapse , maintain certain depressive symptom already depress . The combination depression cerebrovascular disease old adult refer vascular depression associate psychomotor slowing , functional impairment , cognitive impairment . Additionally , likelihood improvement remission low vascular depression difficult treat time . Nimodipine ( NIM ) FDA approve reduce incidence severity problem blood flow result particular type stroke . In addition improve blood flow brain follow stroke , NIM also protect neuron injury degeneration cognitive functional benefit . These positive effect NIM may make useful treatment vascular depression . In previous study people vascular depression , pair NIM antidepressant fluoxetine show great improvement depression treatment outcomes , high likelihood full remission , less incidence depression recurrence use fluoxetine alone . This study examine whether pair NIM antidepressant reduce recurrence vascular depression . Participation study last 56 week divide two phase . In first phase , participant receive antidepressant medication without NIM . Participants begin take escitalopram may switch duloxetine lorazepam add regimen , depend individual treatment effectiveness side effect . The first phase last 6 24 week , end individual participant either respond medication experience 24 week nonresponse . During first phase , participant attend weekly study visit , researcher assess medication effectiveness monitor side effect . At begin second phase , participant randomly assign receive either NIM placebo addition continue antidepressant medication already help . Participants take NIM placebo 8 month , undergo weekly study visit first month monthly study visit last 7 month . During visit , researcher monitor participant ' health reaction medication . After 4 , 16 , 32 week , EKG test perform , 16 32 week , cognitive physical test perform . After 8 month , participant attend three weekly study visit use medication lower end .
