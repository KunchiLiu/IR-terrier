	<brief_title>Home Blood Pressure Telemonitoring Case Management Control Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood pressure ( BP ) control recommended level 1 3 people hypertension , little improvement since late 1980s , despite advance evidence support aggressive hypertension control , availability many new effective antihypertensive drug . It clear meaningful sustain improvement hypertension control likely require fundamental change current physician-centered office-visit base model care hypertension . In project develop implement intervention take advantage new technology team model care improve BP measurement control , solve problem limited application case management approach hypertension care improvement . The study take place diverse population adult hypertension care real-world primary care set . The Telemonitoring Intervention ( TI ) integrate 2 innovative component : First , home BP measure do use state-of-the-art modem-enabled automated equipment internally store electronically transmits BP data simple touch-tone telephone connection secure web site . Second , pharmacist case manager integrate primary care team jointly use electronic medical record ( EMR ) formulary adjusts antihypertensive therapy use approve write protocol , collaborative practice agreement physician . Treatment decision base home BP data discuss communicated patient telephone visit pharmacist case manager . Two-way communication pharmacist case manager patient 's primary care team assure use share EMR additional secure messaging result every pharmacist encounter primary care team . To assess impact TI hypertension control , patient satisfaction , cost care , conduct cluster-randomized trial , assign 16 primary care clinic 450 nested patient uncontrolled hypertension either Usual Care ( UC ) control group TI . Blood pressure outcomes group determine baseline , 6 , 12 18 month identical blind fashion research clinic separate clinical setting patient receive medical care . We hypothesize guideline BP control achieve 6 month maintain 12 month 60 % patient TI clinic , compare &lt; 40 % patient UC clinic . We compare satisfaction care cost TI UC group . The TI potential improve hypertension control million patient , could implement widely diverse large patient population base performance randomize trial . The result project important implication future effort improve care provide many estimate 20 million Americans uncontrolled hypertension .</detailed_description>
