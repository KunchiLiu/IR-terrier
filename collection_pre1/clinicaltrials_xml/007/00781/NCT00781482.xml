	<brief_summary>This study compare interaction placebo two FDA-approved sleep medication , Eszopiclone ( Lunesta ) Zolpidem ( Ambien ) , certain chemical receptor brain . We want show use positron emission tomography image measure bind medication receptor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography Assessment Central Nervous System Effects Eszopiclone Zolpidem</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We enroll 4 normal , healthy , adult male volunteer undergo screen test ( lab , EKGs , medical history , physical exam , MRI brain ) safety . If eligible , return three separate positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . Over course three study visit , subject receive eszopiclone ( Lunesta ) , zolpidem ( ambien ) placebo random order . After medication placebo dose , PET scan do use [ 11-C ] flumazenil ( Romazicon ) . The flumazenil help u measure bind study medication chemical receptor call GABA receptor certain part brain .</detailed_description>
