	<brief_title>Fuchs ' Torsional Phaco Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fuchs ' endothelial dystrophy progressive , bilateral disease corneal endothelium , eventually lead corneal decompensation . In early stage , patient develop visually significant cataract . During cataract surgery ultrasound ( US ) power use emulsify lens , lead endothelial cell loss tissue damage . The reduction US power become primary surgical goal cataract surgery , especially important patient Fuchs ' endothelial dystrophy limit endothelial cell loss . In 2006 , Alcon Surgical introduce torsional mode phacoemulsification system ( Infiniti Vision System ) . It include handpiece produce rotary oscillation phacoemulsification tip suggest reduce amount US power require remove cataractous nucleus , produce repulsion break cataract shear conventional jackhammer effect . This reduction US power , could lead less endothelial cell damage conventional ( longitudinal ) mode , report recently patient hard cataract . It important investigate patient Fuchs ' endothelial dystrophy , patient compromise endothelial cell layer benefit less endothelial cell damage . Consequently , low level endothelial damage may postpone date keratoplasty .</detailed_description>
