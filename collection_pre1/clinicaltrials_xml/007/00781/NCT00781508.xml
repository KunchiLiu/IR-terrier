	<brief_summary>Sildenafil ( Viagra ) know reduce pulmonary hypertension . Heart failure patient also pulmonary hypertension several recent report show sildenafil lead improvement exercise capacity . In study sildenafil cause reduction pulmonary systemic vascular resistance , improve pulmonary gas diffusion perhaps increase cardiac output . It uncertain leave ventricular filling pressure reduce whether improvement leave ventricular relaxation . The investigator hypothesize heart failure patient improvement exercise capacity associate sildenafil relate significant reduction leave ventricular filling pressure . The investigator propose study 20 patient stable moderately symptomatic heart failure . The study design randomize cross-over trial administration single dose sildenafil 50 mg match placebo . Exercise capacity determine oral administration sildenafil 50 mg placebo . Left ventricular filling pressure assess Doppler echocardiography serum level B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP know increase higher leave ventricular filling pressure ) . After initial echocardiogram perform 6 minute walk test , patient give either sildenafil matching placebo randomize double-blind fashion . One hr later blood sample serum BNP , echocardiogram 6 minute walk test repeat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sildenafil ( Viagra ) extensively studied patient idiopathic pulmonary hypertension . It reduce pulmonary vascular resistance , improve exercise capacity approve therapy condition . Heart failure ( HF ) patient also pulmonary hypertension several recent report show sildenafil lead improvement exercise capacity . In HF sildenafil cause reduction pulmonary systemic vascular resistance , improve pulmonary gas diffusion perhaps increase cardiac output . It uncertain leave ventricular filling pressure reduce whether improvement leave ventricular relaxation . We hypothesize HF patient improvement exercise capacity associate sildenafil relate significant reduction leave ventricular filling pressure . We propose study 10 patient stable , symptomatic HF Class III . The study design randomize cross-over assignment administration single oral dose sildenafil 50 mg match placebo . Patients exclude walk impaired due non-cardiac condition take nitrate . Exercise capacity determine 60 minute oral administration sildenafil 50 mg placebo . The difference standardize 6 minute walk test ( distance patient able walk 6 minute interval ) use assess exercise capacity . Left ventricular filling pressure assess Doppler echocardiography serum level B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) . Evaluation leave ventricular relaxation determine Doppler echocardiography technique . Each patient blood sample BNP , initial echocardiogram perform 6 minute walk test . They give single dose either sildenafil matching placebo randomize double-blind fashion . The randomization perform half group would receive placebo initial test sildenafil subsequent test half would reverse sequence . One hr medication/placebo administration blood sample serum BNP , echocardiogram 6 minute walk test repeat . After completion protocol , patient return 48 hr protocol repeat predetermined assignment either placebo sildenafil .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults Class III congestive heart failure impair leave ventricular systolic function . A prior BNP level â‰¥ 200 pg/mL . Previously document systolic pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 40 mmHg . Clinically stable minimum 6 week . Able give inform consent , Unable give inform consent . Currently take nitrate . A HF exacerbation within past 6 week . Comorbid condition could limit walk . Have rest systolic blood pressure &lt; 110 mmHg</criteria>
