	<brief_summary>Of estimate number 529,000 maternal death year 2000 , 132,000 ( 25 % ) cause postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) ; 99 % death occur low-income country . Where maternal mortality high resource limit , introduction low-cost , evidence-based practice primary prevention PPH urgent need . Controlled cord traction ( CCT ) actively promote combination prophylactic uterotonics prevention PPH . While administration uterotonics proven effective , evidence CCT beneficial safe . The investigator propose study evaluate two primary question : 1 . In woman term , single vaginal delivery hospital setting , third stage manage prophylactic oxytocin , CCT produce clinically significant reduction incidence postpartum blood lose ? 2 . In woman , CCT produce clinically significant increase incidence severe complication , include uterine inversion need subsequent surgical evacuation retain placental tissue membrane ( curettage manual removal ) ? To answer two question design two arm randomize controlled trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Cord Traction During Third Stage Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects This study conduct two Public Hospital Montevideo , Uruguay . A total 200 woman ( 100 group ) recruit . Description Study Design This two-arm , randomize control clinical trial 200 woman single vaginal delivery receive prophylactic oxytocin management third stage labor two public hospital Montevideo allocate one two intervention : CCT `` hands-off '' policy . All outcome measure maternal discharge hospital . The primary outcome postpartum blood loss . Duration Study We estimate need total 11 month complete study . Three month need preparation ( instal data collection resource train data collector birth attendant ) , 6 month recruitment , two month data analysis preparation report manuscript . Where Subjects Are/ Study Site Populations The study conduct two public hospital Montevideo , Uruguay . These third level public hospital support University Republic , total 9,900 delivery per year . Full Description Risks There evidence suggest risk study woman newborn , know CCT associate serious complication mother . In previous active management trial two CCT trial , report case uterine inversion , currently , CCT recommend standard care delivery . In theory , severe potential complication uterine inversion , life-threatening condition adequate care provide . However , event unlikely simultaneous use uterotonics assure well contract uterus eventually , successfully manage hospital setting . Benefits Subjects and/or Society : We expect clinical important benefit study individual level pregnant woman . However , study provide useful information evaluate one specific intervention recommend management third stage labor . Inducement Participants : No monetary inducement offer participant . Costs Subjects : N/A Statistical Analysis Before address research question , descriptive statistic summary graphic histogram prepare examined outcome demographic variable . All analyse address study research question use `` intention treat '' principle , thus compare original intervention group original nonintervention group , even individual withdraw study shift another group . The analysis plan presentation result follow recommendation CONSORT statement . In study primary outcome continue ( blood loss ) , therefore , median inter-quartile range compute part descriptive data analysis understand distribution outcome variable assess need data transformation adoption nonparametric test , include Mann-Whitney U test . Means two group compare two-sample t-test . A similar analysis perform duration ( minute ) third stage labor . Methods Recruitment : Enrollment do previous woman 's labor maternity . Screening start time admission possible prenatal care , eligible woman , sign consent form require . Sealed envelope open delivery ( delivery guard ) use determine whether woman receive CCT . A random allocation scheme derive computer-generated list number , randomly permute block . Informed Consent Services director provide write authorization participate study . Individual birth attendant receive information sheet describe objective study include name phone number study coordinator . Birth attendant also invite participate training workshop . Women invite participate upon admission hospital ( prenatal care possible ) , agree participate , provide write informed consent birth attendant . The birth attendant require disclose patient fact nature trial , intervention comparison , risk involve , available alternative risk , reasonable expectation treatment outcome . This study submit Institutional Review Board School Medicine , University Uruguay approval Institutional Review Board Tulane University . The PI co-PI attend training session protection human subject certify Institutional Review Boards institution . The coordinator research assistant invite participate study ask complete on-line training session protection human subject .</detailed_description>
