	<brief_summary>Transforming growth factor-beta 1 consistently express fibrotic disease display variety profibrotic effect fibroblast ( 25 , 26 ) . Activation TGF-beta receptor induces activation several kinase signal cascade lead phosphorylation SMAD proteins well activation SMAD-independent kinase collectively activate ECM synthesis fibroblast growth differentiation myofibroblasts . TGF-beta 1 one main mediator fibrotic process , associate scar long list pathology relate chronic inflammation affect type organ tissue . An increase TGF-beta1 mRNA protein level describe process . Peptide 144 ( P144 ) acetic salt 14mer peptide human TGF-beta1 type III receptor ( betaglycan ) . P144 TGF-beta1-inhibitor specifically design block interaction TGF-beta1 TGF-beta1 type III receptor , thus block biological effect . P144 show significant antifibrotic activity mouse receive repeat sucutaneous injection bleomycin , widely accept animal model human scleroderma , could contribute development . The aim study asses long-term safety topical application P144 cream treatment skin fibrosis patient systemic sclerosis extension open-label treatment period 6 additional month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Label Extension ( OLE ) Patients Treated ISD002-P144-07 Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis scleroderma multisystemic disorder characterize excessive synthesis deposition extracellular matrix protein result fibrosis skin visceral organ ( include gastrointestinal tract , lung , heart kidney ) .The pathogenesis scleroderma complex still poorly understood , major pathway involve development condition microvascular immunological abnormality , well dysregulation fibroblast activity . One key molecule involve pathogenesis skin fibrosis TGF-beta1 ; TGF-beta1 cytokine directly responsible fibroblast proliferation collagen extracellular matrix overproduction . The affected skin patient systemic sclerosis gradually become firm , thicken eventually tightly bound underlie subcutaneous tissue ( indurative phase ) . It lose hair , oil , sweat gland become dry coarse . Changes begin distally extremity advance proximally . Lesions develop period time varying month year . In patient limited scleroderma , skin finger , hand , face low arm legs affected . On contrary , patient diffuse cutaneous disease , skin change become generalized , involve initially extremity follow face trunk . Rapid progression change 2 3 year period usually associate great risk visceral disease . After several year disease , skin may soften return normal thickness become thin atrophic . The EMEA FDA grant P144 orphan drug status treatment systemic sclerosis . The primary objective ass long-term safety P144 crem topically administer skin manifestation systemic sclerosis patient term incidence treatment related adverse event extension period six month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Previous participation finalization treatment period ISD002P14407 study without clinical relevant safety issue medically evaluate investigator . 2 . For female subject childbearing potential : use know highly effective method birth control , define result low failure rate : i.e . le 1 % per year , ( contraceptive pill , intrauterine contraceptive device , implant , vasectomized partner sexual abstinence ) , least extension study period one month end extension study . 3 . For male subject partner childbearing potential : use appropriate contraceptive method ( vasectomy , condom sexual abstinence ) , least extension study period one month end extension study . 4 . Stable therapy least one month , except case patient treatment putative disease modify agent ( immunosupressants like cyclophosphamide , azathioprine ) need least three month stable therapy , without expectation treatment modification trial period.. 5 . Capable understanding willing provide sign dated write voluntary informed consent protocol specific procedure perform 1 . Other skin disease affect treatment area could diagnose ISD002P14407 study . 2 . Woman become pregnant ISD002P14407 study . 3 . Any new diagnosis since ISD002P14407 study include : systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma , localize escleroderma , eosinophilic fascitis , eosinophilia myalgia syndrome ; definable connective tissue disease , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , polymyositis , dermatomyositis ; clinically significant overlap condition ; significant exist internal organ damage define guideline clinical trial systemic sclerosis ; history skin cancer ; skin diseases affect treatment area . 4 . Substantial history environmental exposure taint rapeseed oil , vinyl chloride , L tryptophan , bleomycin , trichoroethylene , silica ; PUVA therapy within 1 month study drug initiation ; concurrent interventional therapy might independently influence outcome trial , Dpenicillamine , cyclosporine , methotrexate , interferonÎ³ photopheresis ; topical corticosteroid treatment affect select area ; cosmetic treatment area .</criteria>
