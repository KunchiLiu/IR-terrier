	<brief_summary>This study international , open-label , multi-center , Phase II , multiple dose , dose-finding study investigate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic characteristic BPS-MR tablet male female patient PAH . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enter Treatment Phase Baseline visit . Patients begin take one BPS-MR tablet ( 60µg ) twice daily ( b.i.d . ) escalate one tablet b.i.d . week maximum dose 600µg ( ten tablet ) b.i.d patient reach MTD . Following achievement MTD , patient down-titrated BPS-MR weekly one tablet b.i.d . decrement . Patients may , alternatively , elect continue take study drug MTD separate open-label extension study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study international , open-label , multi-center , Phase II , multiple dose , dose-finding study investigate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic characteristic BPS-MR tablet male female patient PAH . All patient receive background therapy either phosphodiesterase ( PDE-5 ) inhibitor , endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) , combination two . The study divide two phase : 1 . The Treatment Phase 2 . The Down-Titration Phase Screening conduct outpatient basis within 21 day prior Baseline visit . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion Baseline visit enter Treatment Phase begin take one BPS-MR tablet ( 60µg ) b.i.d . escalate one tablet b.i.d . week maximum dose 600µg ( ten tablet ) b.i.d . patient reach intolerable dose . Patients reach intolerable dose instruct continue treatment previous dose , consider individual MTD . For example , patient attains full week six BPS-MR tablet b.i.d . ( 360µg ) unable tolerate seven tablet ( 420µg ) patient return use six tablet BPS-MR b.i.d . ( 360µg ) additional week treatment . In scenario , BPS-MR 360µg b.i.d . patient 's MTD . Patients reach intolerable dose tolerate full ten week BPS-MR dosing consider individual MTD BPS-MR 600µg b.i.d . When patient reach individual MTD ( either 10 week earlier ) return site 3-7 day End Treatment Phase assessment evaluate safety , optionally , PK assessment . Subsequent End Treatment Phase visit patient instructed begin down-titration BPS-MR weekly increment . However , patient may alternatively elect continue take BPS-MR MTD separate open-label extension study .</detailed_description>

Has previously undergone cardiac catheterization consistent PAH , specifically PAPm ≥25 mmHg ( rest ) , PCWP ( leave ventricular end diastolic pressure ) ≤15 mmHg , PVR &gt; 3 wood unit ; 5 . Has course endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) phosphodiesterase inhibitor ( PDE5 ) combination least 90 day time Baseline visit ; 6 . Has unencouraged sixminute walk distance ( 6MWD ) 300 600 meter Screening visit ; 7 . Is able communicate effectively study personnel ; 8 . Is consider reliable , willing , cooperative compliant study protocol requirement ; 9 . Provides voluntary , write informed consent participate study ; 10 . Is , female , physiologically incapable childbearing practice acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , surgical sterilization , approve hormonal contraceptive , barrier method [ condom diaphragm ] use spermicide , intrauterine device ) . 1 . Has pulmonary venous hypertension , pulmonary venoocclusive disease , pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary hypertension relate congenital heart disease , chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ; 2 . Is pregnant lactating ; 3 . Has know intolerance beraprost sodium prostanoids ; 4 . Has preexist condition could interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug ; 5 . Current use tobacco product ; 6 . Known history syncope ; 7 . Has , opinion Investigator , concomitant disease accept part inclusion criterion would compromise patient study ; 8 . Has change discontinue PAH medication ( exception anticoagulant ) within 30 day prior Baseline visit ; 9 . Has receive prostanoid therapy within 30 day prior Baseline visit schedule receive additional prostanoid therapy study except acute vasodilatory testing ; 10 . Has receive investigational medication within 30 day prior Baseline visit schedule receive another investigational drug course study ; 11 . In opinion investigator , may unable comply study protocol ; 12 . Has preexist disease know cause pulmonary hypertension ( e.g. , obstructive lung disease , parasitic disease affect pulmonary system , sickle cell anemia , mitral valve stenosis , portal hypertension ) list inclusion criterion ; 13 . Has donate blood plasma lose volume blood &gt; 450 mL within six week prior Baseline visit . 14 . Has ongoing hemorrhagic condition ( e.g . upper digestive track hemorrhage , hemoptysis , etc . ) preexist condition , investigator 's judgement , may increase risk develop hemorrhage study ( e.g . hemophilia ) . However , transient hemorrhage ( e.g . epistaxis , normal menstrual bleeding , gingival bleeding , hemorrhoidal hemorrhage , etc . ) would preclude enrollment</criteria>
