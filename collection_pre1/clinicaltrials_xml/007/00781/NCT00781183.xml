	<brief_summary>Exercise train show reduce breathlessness improve exercise tolerance people lung disease . However , effect exercise training walk speed select people day-to-day life unknown . Furthermore , investigator know exercise training change maximum speed people walk long period time . This study examine relationship walk speed walk endurance follow exercise training people lung disease contribute importantly understanding patient choose walk relation capability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Pulmonary Rehabilitation Change Self-Selected And Maximum Sustainable Walking Speed In Patients With Lung Disease ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) consider standard care patient symptomatic lung disease . It achieve strong evidence reduce symptom improve exercise tolerance . Walking common form physical activity individual need walk course daily activity . Chosen walk speed good indicator debilitate effect disease improvement usual walk speed associate substantial reduction mortality elderly subject . Therefore , important clinician understand patient choose walk relation capability well know relationship change PR . The main purpose study examine relationship walk speed walk endurance PR . Primary aim : estimate maximum walk speed sustain &gt; 24 min ( i.e . maximum sustainable walk speed ; MSWS ) relationship walk speed walk time patient symptomatic lung disease . Secondary aim : ( ) determine choose speed endurance walk test different MSWS , ( ii ) determine MSWS speed choose endurance walk test change response PR , ( iii ) measure repeatability endurance walk time ( EWT ) , define duration patient walk self-selected pace first need stop rest . Significance : Walking common form physical activity . Chosen walk speed capacity endure walk different speed help quantify disability . Also , study examine effect PR survival available . However , indirect evidence suggest PR improve many risk factor associate mortality patient COPD . This study examine effect PR usual walk speed select individual symptomatic lung disease , demonstrate predictor mortality elderly individual . Therefore , study may contribute indirect evidence effect PR survival .</detailed_description>
