	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether early intervention vitamin D stage II/III chronic kidney disease prevent delay secondary hyperparathyroidism . Subjects receive vitamin D placebo study entry follow period one year . The hypothesis subject give vitamin D low PTH high 25 ( OH ) D 1 year compare placebo . Additionally , less subject progress secondary hyperparathyroidism vitamin D treat group compare placebo treat group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Secondary Hyperparathyroidism With Vitamin D Stage II/III Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D important maintain normal calcium homeostasis optimal bone health ( 1 , 2 ) . The synthesis vitamin D metabolism 1,25 ( OH ) 2D regulate parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , serum calcium , phosphorus level . In response low serum calcium level , serum PTH activate alpha-1-hydroxylase increase 1,25 ( OH ) 2D production kidney also enhance tubular reabsorption calcium ( 3 ) . The high level 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D result increase intestinal calcium absorption ( 4 ) . Increased serum phosphorus level occur early stage chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) result inhibition 1-alpha-hydroxylase , result decrease 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D production , decrease intestinal calcium absorption lead secondary hyperparathyroidism increase PTH level . Circulating 1,25 ( OH ) 2D level begin fall glomerular filtration rate le 40 mL/min occasionally even less 80 mL/min ( 11 ) almost always significantly reduced subject end-stage renal failure ( 12 ) . Furthermore , CKD , decrease renal mass also result decrease expression 1-alpha-hydroxlase less production 1,25 ( OH ) 2D also exacerbate secondary hyperparathyroidism ( 5-7 ) . Therefore , CKD three process lead secondary hyperparathyroidism . 1 ) decrease renal mass lead decrease production 1,25 ( OH ) 2D lead compensatory rise PTH enhance production 1,25 ( OH ) 2D 2 ) inhibition renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase accumulate phosphorus level lead decrease 1,25 ( OH ) 2D also lead secondary hyperparathyroidism . 3 ) increase phosphorus lead low ionized calcium lead increase parathyroid hormone secretion . Untreated secondary hyperparathyroidism lead renal osteodystrophy ( 9 ) increase mortality due cardiovascular disease ( 10 ) . Prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism lead bone resorption eventually autonomous parathyroid hormone secretion term tertiary hyperparathyroidism . Vitamin D status one major factor may prevent progression secondary hyperparathyroidism patient CKD . Insufficient level 25-hydroxyvitamin D exacerbate secondary hyperparathyroidism provide adequate substrate renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase conversion active form vitamin D , 1,25 ( OH ) 2D . A recent cross-sectional study patient moderate severe CKD yet dialysis therapy 12 geographically diverse region United States show 29 % 17 % sufficient level , respectively ( 13 ) . Vitamin D status easily correct . In previous study conclude weekly cholecalciferol supplementation effective treatment correct vitamin D status patient CKD stage III IV ( 14 ) . However , PTH level return normal . Therefore , likely early intervention vitamin D necessary prevent rather treat secondary hyperparathyroidism . This major question evaluate study . Can intervene vitamin D early stage chronic kidney disease result decrease incidence secondary hyperparathyroidism ? 2.0 Objectives 2.1 Overall Objective The primary objective study ass improve maintain optimal 25 ( OH ) D level ( National Kidney Foundation great 30ng/ml ) ( 15 ) people stage II/III Chronic Kidney disease would delay progression secondary hyperparathyroidism translate improve marker bone turnover 2.2 Specific Aims Primary : 1 ) To determine double blind , randomize study whether supplementation 50,000 IU cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) give weekly 12 week follow maintenance cholecalciferol 50,000 IU every week would improve maintain vitamin D status CKD patient stage 2/3 compare placebo 12 month . 2 ) To determine whether early intervention vitamin D therapy decrease PTH level 12 week therapy 12 month therapy . Secondary : 1 ) To determine whether early treatment vitamin D result improve level bone turnover markers- tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b ( TRAP5b ) , procollagen Type 1 N-Terminal propeptide ( PINP ) , serum C-Telopeptide Alkaline phosphatase .</detailed_description>
