	<brief_title>Determinants Insulin-induced Weight Gain Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin therapy frequently need achieve adequate glycaemic control type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , often expense weight gain . Insulin-induced weight gain obviously undesirable already overweight population may negatively affect blood pressure , lipid level , inflammatory fibrinolytic parameter , adipocytokines also deter optimization insulin therapy . It unknown determinant predict insulin-induced weight gain type 2 diabetes mellitus . The aim study therefore , assess determinant insulin-induced weight gain type 2 diabetes mellitus . In retrospective cross-sectional study ( Jansen HJ et al. , submit ) two extreme subgroup identify ( subject weight gain 80th percentile ) subgroup non-weight gainer ( subject weight gain 20th percentile ) . It find gainer less energy expenditure initiation insulin therapy non-weight gainer . Therefore , primary aim study detect association energy expenditure weight gain</detailed_description>
