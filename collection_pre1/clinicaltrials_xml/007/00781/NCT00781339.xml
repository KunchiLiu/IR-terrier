	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study NVC-422 Bacteriuria Catheterized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter-associated urinary tract infection ( CAUTI ) major healthcare problem U.S. , account approximately 40 % hospital acquire infection . Microorganisms colonize catheter extraluminally intraluminally , often protect biofilm environment . Nearly patient catherized 30 day longer develop bacteriuria , presence bacteria normally sterile urine . Ten twenty percent patient develop symptomatic CAUTI . In 1-4 % , infection spread kidney bloodstream , lead potentially lethal bacteremia . Currently , bladder irrigation solution reduce eliminate CAUTI . A bladder instillation solution keep bladder catheter substantially free bacteria biofilm expect provide practical cost-effective mean minimize CAUTIs . NVC-422 topical , non-antibiotic , fast acting , broad spectrum anti-microbial , exhibit potential rapid decolonization range urologic pathogen , include Escherichia Coli ( E. coli ) , Enterococcus spp. , P. mirabilis others . In vitro study NVC-422 also show capable penetrating biofilm effectively kill contain microbe .</detailed_description>
