	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale Serious mental illness ( SMI ) second costly disorder treat VHA , yet clinical outcome patient often poor due combination low quality care severe cognitive functional impairment . While problem multifaceted , study outside VHA show use `` consumer provider '' ( CPs ) improve augment care . Similar recover addiction counselor , CPs individual SMI use live experience provide service others SMI . CPs reach patient difficult engage , assist patient tasks daily living , offer variety rehabilitation ( vocational , social , residential ) service , role model offer hope recovery , facilitate support group . Randomized control quasi-experimental trial outside VHA show CPs provide service yield least equivalent patient outcomes particular benefit note intensive case management team . VHA hire 250 CPs date , although impact document . Yet success outside VHA recent emphasis recovery-oriented care suggest need test model VHA . Objectives To conduct randomize controlled trial test impact patient level team level outcome implementation CP service six mental health intensive case management ( MHICM ) team VISN-22 . The specific aim : 1 ) Evaluate acceptability , facilitator barrier inclusion two CPs intervention MHICM team . 2 ) Evaluate effect include CPs degree MHICM team service recovery-oriented . 3 ) Evaluate effect include CPs veteran ' clinical recovery-focused outcome . Our hypothesis CPs would feasible acceptable , team would become recovery-oriented , involvement CPs would lead great gain recovery , quality life , empowerment regard illness , less extent , symptom compare patient team without CPs . Methods This project `` cluster randomize control trial '' compare 3 CP-MHICM team ( CPs ) 3 control team ( i.e. , without CP ) , MHICM sit within VISN-22 . All patient 6 MHICM team ' caseload site 's recruitment period eligible . 282 MHICM patient enrol , 149 intervention sit 133 control site . Each intervention MHICM team use strategic planning process tailor CP intervention local priority structure , involve multiple meeting discuss CP 's role , hire , incorporation CPs team . The project hire CPs , provide training , assist implementation team provide ongoing supervision . The CPs work 12 month . Using patient survey , study assess impact CPs patient level outcomes include recovery-orientation team ( Recovery Self-assessment scale ) , individual recovery ( Mental Health Recovery Measure , Illness Self-Management Scale ) , quality life ( Quality Life Interview ) , symptom ( BASIS-24 ) , patient activation ( Patient Activation Measure ) . The patient level outcome assessment conduct pre post intervention . Final follow-up assessment rate range 71- 95 % intervention sit 80 - 88 % control sit . We conduct site visit six MHICM team use validate , standardize protocol , rating team 's level recovery orientation deployment CPs Recovery-Oriented Practices Index ( ROPI ) . We conduct 23 focus group interview patient , provider CPs intervention site ( 8 per site ) post time point assess barrier facilitator CP implementation . All focus group interview record , transcribe , cod use Atlas.ti . The analysis patient survey data comparison change baseline followup score regression analyse change score outcomes mention . The first analyse whether intervention group significantly relate change consider treatment group statistically control baseline score . The second first , add demographic ( age , gender , race , live situation education level ) site fix covariates . The ROPI rating make small number unit ( 6 team ) , therefore result descriptive involved percent change pre post . The focus group interview summarize summarized site . The study team discuss result . Using constant comparison method , salient topic compare within across role site . Status Completed . Major activity accomplishment include hire 6 CPs together log 2000 clinical encounter fund period project .</detailed_description>
