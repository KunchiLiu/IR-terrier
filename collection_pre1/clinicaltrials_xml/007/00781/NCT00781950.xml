	<brief_title>Effects Dietary Flaxseed Symptoms Cardiovascular Disease Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose trial one year , double blind , placebo control study design examine compare effect dietary ground flaxseed supplementation volunteer claudication secondary low extremity atherosclerotic arterial disease ( peripheral arterial disease ) . The original proposal two year study duration truncate one year insure patient compliance remain high . This patient population likely benefit flaxseed high prevalence accelerate atherosclerosis high normal incidence arrhythmia , myocardial infarction stroke . This study focus whether dietary flaxseed reduce clinical manifestation peripheral arterial disease increase exercise capacity patient . Two general hypothesis test proposal . First , hypothesize few primary secondary event ( all-cause mortality , cardiovascular mortality , stroke , myocardial infarction , angina , arrhythmia ) occur patient ingest flaxseed diet . Secondly , hypothesize dietary flaxseed supplementation associate beneficial effect exercise performance , blood pressure circulate lipid level . This trial generate data safety , tolerability , cardiovascular efficacy genomic response diet rich flaxseed patient peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) .</detailed_description>
