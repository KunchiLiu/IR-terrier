	<criteria>Unresectable HCC without systemic metastasis . Willing , able mentally competent provide write informed consent prior test study protocol , include screen test evaluation consider part subject 's routine care . Aged 18 year old either gender race , religion socioeconomic group . Unequivocal diagnosis primary HCC ( define ) HCC amenable surgical resection immediate liver transplantation , optimally treatable local ablative technique radiofrequency ablation , consistent practice clinical trial centre . Measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥10 mm spiral CT scan . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Adequate haematological , renal hepatic function follow : Leukocytes ≥ 2,500/μL Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1,500/μL Platelets ≥ 50,000/μL Haemoglobin &gt; 9.5 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ( SIRSpheres administer whole liver treatment total bilirubin &gt; 2X institutional upper limit normal ) . INR ≤ 2.0 ALP ≤ 5 x institutional upper limit normal AST / ALT ≤ 5 x institutional upper limit normal Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL The blood result must less 29 day old time confirm patient eligibility receive protocol treatment . Life expectancy least 3 month without active treatment . This defined patient OKUDA I II inoperable HCC . Suitable protocol treatment determine clinical assessment undertaken Investigator . Female patient must either postmenopausal , premenopausal , must negative pregnancy test agree use two form contraception sexually active study participation . Male patient must surgically sterile , sexually active premenopausal female partner must use acceptable form contraception . Hepatic arterial anatomy suitable implantation SIRSpheres , assess hepatic angiogram . Lung shunt fraction less equal 20 % assessed Tc99m macroaggregated albumin liver lung breakthrough scan . Had previous external beam radiation therapy liver . Any ascites clinical sign liver failure , physical examination . Abnormal synthetic excretory liver function test ( LFTs ) determine serum albumin ( must &lt; 2.5 g/dL ) total bilirubin ( must &gt; 2.0 mg/dL ) , respectively . Tumours amenable surgical resection cure presentation . Greater 20 % lung shunt hepatic artery blood flow determine Tc99 MAA scan . Preassessment angiogram Tc99 MAA scan demonstrate significant uncorrectable activity stomach , pancreas bowel . Been treat Capecitabine within previous 8 week , treat Capecitabine within 8 week treatment SIRSpheres , due possible risk potentiate cause liver dysfunction . Complete main portal vein thrombosis . Subjects hepatic artery direct therapy . Subjects prior chemotherapy medical agent use treat hepatocellular carcinoma . Prior external hepatic radiation therapy HCC , concomitant therapy HCC investigational agent plan protocol . Subjects inferior vena cava ( IVC ) tumour thrombus invasion Currently receive investigational agent treatment cancer . Any concurrent malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient diseasefree least five year . Presence clinical sign CNS metastasis due poor prognosis progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection ( except viral hepatitis ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Any following contraindication angiography selective visceral catheterization : Bleeding diathesis , correctable standard form therapy . Severe peripheral vascular disease would preclude arterial catheterization . Portal hypertension hepatofugal flow document baseline spiral CT scan . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition SIRSpheres . Inability unwillingness understand sign write informed consent document ( non Englishspeaking patient may use interpreter ) . Female subject pregnant currently breastfeed . For female subject , unless postmenopausal surgically sterile , unwillingness practice effective contraception , define Investigator , study . The rhythm method use sole method contraception . For male subject , unwillingness practice effective contraception ( defined Investigator ) take part study , effect SIRSpheres treatment sperm upon development unborn child unknown . Current enrolment investigational drug device study .</criteria>
