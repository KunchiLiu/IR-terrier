	<brief_summary>The clinically widely use X-ray compute tomography examination low-grade radiation effect recently attract much attention concern possible adverse effect radiation human body [ ref . 1-5 ] . The radiation harmful human tissue cell mainly interact water ( make 80 % cell ) generate reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , especially formation hydroxyl radical . So far reach , report concern relation X-ray compute tomography examination blood ROS concentration . Therefore , wish conduct study clarify routinely apply X-ray compute tomography examination may induce high concentration ROS peripheral blood . Study subject participant health check program hospital . The enrollment condition schedule X-ray computed tomography examination either lung ( 20 case ) heart ( 20 case ) study subject . Another 20 participant receive health check program without X-ray compute tomography examination include control group . The formal consent deliver participant health check program several day admission health check retrieve proceed health check . Measurements comparison ROS concentration perform sampled peripheral blood performance X-ray compute tomography examination regular health check program . Totally 120 blood sample collect include 60 study subject within 3 month . Reactive oxygen species（ROS）levels measure chemiluminescence ( CL ) analyse system ( CLD-110 , Tohoku Electronic Industrial , Sendai , Japan ) .</brief_summary>
