	<brief_title>Single Dosing Zoledronic Acid Cancer Therapy Induced Bone Loss ( CTIBL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone metastases frequently one first sign disseminate disease cancer patient . Skeletal complication due metastatic disease include ( severe ) bone pain , spinal cord compromise , pathological fracture , hypercalcemia . Zoledronic acid member class compound know bisphosphonates . Bisphosphonates effective inhibitor osteoclastic bone resorption demonstrate therapeutic efficacy treatment hypercalcemia malignancy , lytic bone disease associate multiple myeloma , mixed lytic blastic bone metastasis associate breast cancer . The precise mechanism bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast function fully understood , may include direct toxic effect mature osteoclast , inhibition osteoclast production precursor cell , impairment osteoclast chemotaxis sit active bone resorption . Osteoclasts specialize bone cell erode mineralize bone secrete acid lysosomal enzyme . In normal bone remodeling , osteoclastic bone resorption couple equilibrium osteoblastic bone formation . The lytic bone destruction associate malignant bone metastasis develop tumor cell synthesize release soluble factor stimulate osteoclast resorb bone . The osteoclastic activating factor release tumor cell include parathyroid hormone-related peptide ( PTHrP ) , growth factor , cytokine . The malignant activation osteoclast result disruption normal bone remodel wherein equilibrium bone resorption bone formation shift toward increase bone resorption . This relative increase osteoclastic bone resorption result net loss bone . Thus , predominant role osteoclast pathogenesis bone destruction inhibitory effect bisphosphonates osteoclast function form rationale use bisphosphonates treatment osteolytic bone metastasis . The common role , regardless tumor type , osteoclast mediator bone destruction metastatic skeletal disease indicate inhibitory effect bisphosphonates tumor-induced osteolysis animal model utilize various malignant cell line effectiveness bisphosphonates therapy tumor-induced hypercalcemia arise type cancer . Moreover , recent study specifically show therapy bisphosphonate pamidronate ( Aredia ) combine antineoplastic therapy significantly reduce proportion patient skeletal complication due lytic bone disease associate multiple myeloma breast cancer compare antineoplastic therapy alone .</detailed_description>
