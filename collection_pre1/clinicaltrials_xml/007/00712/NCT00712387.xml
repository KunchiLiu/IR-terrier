	<brief_summary>The hypothesis trial demonstrate training junior surgeon virtual reality ( VR ) simulator addition didactic teaching improve intraoperative performance compare trainee receive traditional teaching paradigm ( i.e , operate guidance instruction consultant general surgeon ) . We anticipate VR train group make less critical intraoperative error perform faster traditionally trained colleague . Other study question include : 1 . Does objective assessment fundamental ability ( FA ) visuo-spatial ability predict intra-operative performance ? 2 . Do FA predict rate learn reach proficiency ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Proficiency- Based Simulation Training General Surgical Trainees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan assess 30 junior surgical trainee train hospital nationwide . All baseline assessment fundamental ability ( FA ) psychomotor , visuospatial perceptual ability . The trainee randomise one two group : Group A-will receive 'traditional ' training programme ; i.e . receive whatever clinical training patient supervise consultant deems appropriate . This way junior surgeon currently train . They also receive standard didactic teach School Surgeons e-learning resource . Group B-will assign 'proficiency-based progression ' training programme . These trainee require train virtual reality ( VR ) simulator ( Lap Simâ„¢ ) laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) . Trainees objectively set goal reach simulator demonstrate proficiency permit progress next , challenging level . These supervise session last long one hour time . The proficiency measure predetermine error , economy instrument movement economy safety diathermy usage . The benchmark 'gold standard ' proficiency establish objectively assess performance expert consultant surgeon . Group B also receive standard School Surgeons instruction , unlike Group A , demonstrate proficiency didactic module progress operate theatre . Trainees VR traditional group perform five video-recorded laparoscopic cholecystectomy respective training hospital . The first three carry early trainee rotation last two towards end rotation . Each trainee supervise consultant surgeon procedure ; consultant ready take procedure trainee run difficulty . The video recording forward National Surgical Training Centre assess two consultant surgeon blind training status trainee . The LC divide 3 distinct phase , exposure cystic duct artery plus clip placement structure , tissue division finally diathermy excision gallbladder liver-bed . The different phase procedure mark , use score system enable observer record whether event pre-described error occur . Senior surgeon takeover event also score error .</detailed_description>
