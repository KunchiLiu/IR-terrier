	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know regimen trastuzumab effective treat early breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial compare two trastuzumab regimen see well work treat woman HER2-positive early breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Treating Women With HER2-Positive Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine disease-free survival woman HER2-positive early breast cancer treat neoadjuvant adjuvant trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) 6 month versus 12 month . Secondary - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine expect incremental cost effectiveness ( cost per quality adjust life year gain ) 6 month versus 12 month trastuzumab . - Determine cardiac function assess leave ventricular ejection fraction every 3 month treatment . - Analyze predictive factor development cardiac damage . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord estrogen receptor status ( negative v positive ) ; chemotherapy timing ( adjuvant v neoadjuvant ) ; chemotherapy type ( anthracycline base [ taxane ] v taxane anthracyclines v taxane-based [ anthracyclines ] ) ; trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) timing ( concurrently vs sequentially [ respect chemotherapy ] ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . All patient also receive standard chemotherapy regimen per local institutional protocol either concurrently sequentially trastuzumab . Patients complete quality life questionnaire use EuroQoL-5D ( EQ-5D ) baseline periodically study treatment . Patients also complete diary out-of-pocket expense associate condition ( i.e. , travel expense , over-the-counter medicine supplement , complementary therapy fund NHS , home help , time away work ) cost-effective analysis . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
