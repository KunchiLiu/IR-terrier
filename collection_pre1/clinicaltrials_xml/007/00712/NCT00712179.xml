	<brief_title>Understanding Different Parameters Locomotor Training ( Type Walking Training ) Person After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first day chance participant become familiar body weight support ( BWS ) system walk different speed . This first day last 2 hour consistent fifteen total minute locomotor train utilize manual trainer . This mean trainer move participant '' body normal walking pattern . The participant give chance rest bout ; however , participant may also rest point . First , participant walk five minute normal comfortable speed 15 % body weight support overhead system . This follow walk speed faster slow participant ' comfortable speed . After initial bout step , train bout . Training conduct 30 % body weight support speed consider normal adult . Trainers assist trunk leg , assist initiation step leg positioning , maintenance upright trunk , pelvic rotation , weight shift . Training consist three bout five minute step total duration 15 minute step . Vital sign , heart rate blood pressure , monitor 5-minute bout . If participant wear Ankle Foot Orthosis ( AFO ) , participant ask walk without , investigator provide participant Aircast , support ankle prevents roll side side , allow foot move freely , Data collect second day . This take approximately five hour . During time participant ask walk ground treadmill . For overground portion , participant walk across 14-foot level , pressure-sensitive walkway participant ' speed fast participant ' safely . This walkway measure speed walk size step . The participant use assistive device participant ' typically use . A physical therapist train assistant walk beside participant walk across walkway . The participant ask walk several time across walkway two speed recording make participant ' muscle videotape . The participant also ask walk treadmill . The participant permit practice treadmill walk participant ' feel comfortable . Once participant feel comfortable investigator ask participant walk couple different way . The order random , speed determine first visit . The participant ask walk Body Weight Support without . The investigator ask participant walk participant ' comfortable speed fast participant ' safely walk . The participant also walk speed percentage body weight support trainer help participant step way close normal . The participant able rest point long wish , however , trial participant require rest least 2 minute . During treadmill walk , participant wear harness attach mobile device attach ceiling . This device safety prevent fall catch participant lose balance stumble . It also use provide body weight support walk trial . If participant use brace and/or assistive device , participant ask walk without , accord participant ' comfort safety . A therapist walk participant provide physical assistance may need . For walk testing , investigator may need shave small area participant ' leg attach small sensor skin measure electrical activity leg muscle . The investigator also attach reflective marker small angle measurement device skin participant ' hip several location leg . The investigator film participant ' movement video camera .</detailed_description>
