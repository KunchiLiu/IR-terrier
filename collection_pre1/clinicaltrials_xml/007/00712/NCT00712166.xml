	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy 28-day course aztreonam inhalation solution ( AZLI ) patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , mild lung disease ( forced expiratory volume 1 second [ FEV1 ] &gt; 75 % predict , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Aztreonam Inhalation Solution ( AZLI ) Patients With Cystic Fibrosis , Mild Lung Disease , P. Aeruginosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CF patient often lung infection occur repeatedly worsen time . The lung infection often cause bacteria call Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) . Treatment antibiotic stop slow growth bacteria . The antibiotic may give mouth , intravenously ( IV ) , inhalation mist . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy AZLI , investigational formulation antibiotic aztreonam administer three time day use PARI eFlow® electronic nebulizer , CF patient PA mild lung disease . In study , participant eligibility assess screen visit occur 14 day prior baseline visit ( Day 0 ) . Those participant meet eligibility criterion Day 0 randomize begin 28-day course blind study treatment ( AZLI placebo TID ) . Participants return clinic visit Day 14 , end treatment visit Day 28 , follow visit 14 day last dose trial drug ( Day 42 ) .</detailed_description>
