	<detailed_description>Aging psychosis major priority area VA . This project continuation Merit Review Program , develop , manualized conduct randomize control trial novel psychosocial rehabilitation intervention old people schizophrenia , call cognitive-behavioral social skill train ( CBSST ) . We find CBSST improve community functioning patient . CBSST , however , intensive program may burden VA mental health clinic demand additional staff financial resource Veterans travel time demand . To reduce burden barrier implementation CBSST , develop computer-assisted CBSST intervention take advantage available handheld computer technology ( personal data assistant PDAs ) . Therapist contact cut 50 % replaced handheld computer-assisted CBSST intervention tool . The project examine whether computer-assisted CBSST effective full CBSST program , improve client satisfaction reduce burden cost . A randomized-controlled clinical trial compare 3 treatment condition ( computer-assisted CBSST , CBSST , PDA-only control condition ) conduct . Participants recruit , treat 6 month follow longitudinally 6 month treatment . A multidimensional evaluation treatment outcome , include functioning ( primary outcome ) , CBSST skills acquisition , symptom conduct baseline , mid-treatment , end treatment ( 6-months baseline ) , 6-month follow-up ( 12 month baseline ) . Factors might mediate improvement CBSST assess , include homework adherence , cognitive insight ( metacognition belief flexibility ) , defeatist performance belief ( e.g. , `` Why try , I 'll fail '' ) . The propose project also use innovative computer-assisted Ecological Momentary Assessment ( EMAc ) method measure outcomes . EMAc ambulatory data collection technique permit real time , real world monitoring behavior , mood , cognition . Participants signal handheld computer several time throughout day respond questionnaire , eliminate recall information-processing bias compromise validity traditional self-report interview measure . Outcomes propose trial assess use traditional measure , well EMAc measure . Specific Aims : ( 1 ) To determine whether computer-assisted CBSST effective full CBSST program ( prior project ) supportive contact , despite reduce burden cost . ( 2 ) To examine whether EMAc measure function psychotic symptom sensitive change CBSST . ( 3 ) To examine whether increased cognitive insight , reduced defeatist performance belief , great homework adherence mediate outcome CBSST .</detailed_description>
