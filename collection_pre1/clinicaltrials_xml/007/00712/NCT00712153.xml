	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease major cause morbidity mortality across world coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) common surgical procedure treatment . Patients recurrent ischemic symptom CABG likely occlude significantly stenosis graft native coronary artery . Therefore , need evaluate patency vessel conduit CABG . Until , selective coronary angiography traditional gold standard assessment native coronary artery bypass graft . But invasive procedure require x-ray exposure , hospitalization , include risk complication . However , alternative noninvasive method , multislice compute tomography ( MSCT ) , high specificity excellent sensitivity detection coronary artery disease . It even cheap take short time perform . Accordingly , purpose study use MSCT evaluate patency quality graft native coronary artery CABG two year . In addition , elucidate relationship data CABG procedure review experience .</brief_summary>
