	<brief_summary>This study determine nifedipine , medication use treat high blood pressure , help treat iron overload , condition body contain much iron . Iron overload cause body 's inability regulate iron medical treatment , multiple blood transfusion . Over time , cause problem liver , heart gland . Treatments include reduce iron intake diet remove excess iron use medical therapy . Recently , nifedipine find cause iron loss urine small animal . This study see drug increase removal iron urine human well . People 18 year age old iron overload may eligible study undergo follow procedure : Study Day 1 Participants come NIH Clinical Center medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) echocardiogram ( heart ultrasound ) . Study Day 2 Participants collect three urine sample : one collect 4 hour , follow second 4 hour . Both sample collect NIH outpatient day hospital . At home , third urine sample collect 16 hour . For 1 week collection , participant ask drink tea eat food high Vitamin C iron . They also ask take iron chelate medication . Study Day 3 Participants repeat urine collection day 2 . They collect 4-hour urine sample outpatient day hospital NIH . They take 20-mg tablet nifedipine , remain clinic 4 hour blood pressure monitoring . A second urine sample time . They return home collect final 16-hour sample , bring clinic following day . Again , instruct avoid diet high vitamin C , iron rich food , tea , avoid take iron chelate medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Nifedipine Treat Iron Overload</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron overload common worldwide . If leave untreated , body iron overload lead multiple organ abnormality include hepatic , endocrine ( diabetes ) cardiac failure . In patient ineffective erythropoiesis , iron overload result combination increase intestinal absorption transfusion . Unfortunately , physiological mean remove excess iron limit , treatment limit therapeutic phlebotomy chelation therapy . While phlebotomy preferred therapy patient hemochromatosis , therapy anemic patient largely limited chelation drug . Since drug frequently inadequate , additional iron-reduction therapy seek . Based upon recently publish data rodent model , purpose study determine nifedipine increase iron excretion urine among human increase level iron . Volunteers give single oral dose ( 20mg ) nifedipine . Iron level collection urine measure compare nifedipine determine associate increase urinary iron excretion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Iron overload subject history iron overload may due variety cause include genetic hemochromatosis thalassemia transfusiondependent anemia ( e.g . sickle cell syndrome , aplastic anemia , ineffective erythropoiesis ) cause . Entry study require subject possess least minimal evidence iron overload time entry ( define serum ferritin serum transferrin saturation level normal range ) . Among fifty ( 50 ) subject recruit protocol , least twenty ( 20 ) significant iron overload ( define study ferritin great 500 ng/ml transferrin saturation great ( 50 % ) include . All subject adult age ( great equal 18 yr ) . All subject enrol protocol primary physician care community capable manage medical problem unrelated nifedipine regimen . All subject must able provide inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Allergy nifedipine . Patient receive calcium channel blocker therapy within 7 day prior enrollment . Blood transfusion within 7 day first urine iron evaluation . Pregnant lactating woman . Patients GFR le 60 ml/min . Albumin le 3g/dl . Significant hemoglobinuria ( great than1+ urinalysis ) . Hemoglobin le 10 g/dl Uncompensated cardiac disease include decreased ejection fraction detect echocardiogram , angina , hypotension ( le 90mmHg systolic pressure ) symptomatic arrhythmia . Documented myocardial infarction within one year prior study . Use tea , Vitamin C , iron chelation therapy , iron supplement , grapefruit juice , cimetidine , digitalis , quinidine , betablockers ( due potential increase serum drug level versus cardiovascular risk ) within 7 day prior study .</criteria>
