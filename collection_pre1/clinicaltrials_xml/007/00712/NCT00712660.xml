	<detailed_description>Title Study : ITAREPS Trial : A Prospective Randomized Double-blind Controlled Study IT-aided Mobile Phone-based Relapse Prevention Program Schizophrenia . Estimated Number Study Centers Countries : 30-40 outpatient psychiatrist Czech Republic Slovak Republic . Research Hypothesis : Information Technology-aided Program Relapse Prevention Schizophrenia ( ITAREPS ) decrease number hospitalization patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder treat outpatient psychiatric setting , evidence reduction total number hospitalization due relapse psychosis end 12-months follow-up period active ITAREPS group compare control ( treatment-as-usual ) group . Study Phase : Non Drug Interventional Study Study Objective : To evaluate effectiveness ITAREPS program reduction number hospitalization due relapse psychosis . The ITAREPS program employ mobile phone communication psychiatrist patient . Subjects enrol project ( patient his/her family member ) instruct complete two separate version 10-item Early Warning Signs Questionnaire ( EWSQ ) upon weekly SMS request send automatically system . EWSQ detect proportional worsening ( new onset ) psychotic symptom compare last week 's score complete questionnaire . Individual EWSQ score send subject back ITAREPS system SMS text message . If EWSQ score exceeds give score threshold , immediate ALERT request therapeutic intervention announce investigator e-mail message timely pharmacological intervention trigger accordance Early Intervention Algorithm ( EIA ) . Study design : This international , randomize , double-blind , control , design-blinded , non drug , interventional study . Subjects ( patient family member pair ) randomize 1:1 ratio interventional control group . All subject complete EWSQ weekly basis . In interventional group , e-mail alert message feedback investigator active investigator react use EIA . In control ( treatment-as-usual ) group , alert generate investigator detect react potential sign psychotic relapse use standard clinical approach . The ALERTs report investigator approximately 50 % ALERT event investigator subject keep blinded real study design - parallel ( multiple ) cross-over . The type study design specify section 3.1.1. protocol . This section available investigator provide purpose regulatory ethic review . Study duration : 12 month Number subject : 150 enrol patient/family member pair ( i.e . 300 subject ) result expect 120 evaluable patient/family member pair ( i.e . 240 subject ) participate study . Study population : Male female patient 18 60 ICD-10 diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder healthy family member , eligible mobile phone communicating . Statistical Methods : The primary effectiveness analysis comparison upper bound 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) mean number hospitalization patient active ITAREPS group month 12 compare control ( treatment-as-usual ) group . Rehospitalization risk analyze use Kaplan-Meier survival analysis group . An interim analysis evaluate group difference number psychiatric hospitalization day perform enrolled patient complete Visit 2 ( month 6 ) .</detailed_description>
