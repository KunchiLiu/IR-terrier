	<brief_summary>Topical brimonidine recently introduce alpha 2 receptor agonist use therapy intraocular pressure ( IOP ) reduction patient open angle glaucoma . Although adequate IOP reduction achieve many patient considerable degree variability IOP reduction among subject . The reason interindividual variability entirely clear . Obviously differences pharmacokinetic property due variable penetration drug cornea may responsible . Alternatively , polymorphisms alpha-2 receptor may account difference IOP-lowering efficacy topical brimonidine . This hypothesis test present study . Polymorphisms alpha-2 receptor describe number previous study . In addition , polymorphisms alpha-2 receptor gene show functionally important , particularly polymorphism alpha-2B receptor , high allele frequency caucasian .</brief_summary>
