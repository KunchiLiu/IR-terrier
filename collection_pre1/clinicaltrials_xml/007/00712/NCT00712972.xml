	<detailed_description>Injection knee joint , although consider remedial procedure much medical community , easy procedure reproducibly accurately perform one would believe . Numerous author estimate 20 30 percent knee injection procedure fail deposit injectate joint space ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 9 ) ( 11 ) . In response reportedly high complication rate associate intra-articular deposit injectate , numerous author publish different technique , injection site , trick help clinician . Techniques air arthrography ( 12 ) ( 13 ) , backflow technique ( 7 ) , triangle technique ( 11 ) , others add complexity time seemingly easy procedure . Specific anatomic relationship within knee joint provide large access window relatively easy entry technique others . Additionally , presence hyaline articular cartilage , smooth , nonreplicable joint surface integral efficient pain free articulation joint add another complexity concern access knee joint . Iatrogenic damage cartilage probable commonly employ injection technique . Damage articular surface anatomic equivalent arthritic pathologic change within knee joint . Much confusion surround accurate intra-articular injection stem anatomic relationship teach training . Anatomical atlas depict layer knee joint fashion tangible recognizable joint space easily insert needle . This case normal knee knee effusion . The reality normal adult knee 2 cc synovial fluid disperse extremely thin film top articular cartilage . The synovial membrane effect rest directly top articular cartilage hence joint space actually potential space . Even though case , three predominate area recess within knee joint needle accurately place , potential space develop . These three region inter-trochlear groove , inter-condylar notch , suprapatellar pouch . The inter-trochlear groove region anterior surface femur lie directly patella knee extend position . The inter-trochlear groove cover articular cartilage integral maintain normal pain free patellofemoral articulation . The inter-condylar notch region femur distal aspect house ACL PCL tendon . The inter-condylar notch articular region knee joint cover articular cartilage . The fact articular cartilage inter-condylar notch significantly reduce chance iatrogenic cartilage damage . Placement needle precisely one space crucial successful injection . There debate safest reliable technique intra-articular knee injection last decade . Five common procedure , include technique study research protocol currently employ medical community access knee joint . These five technique share basic material principle , five carry risk associated insertion foreign body joint space . The medial lateral infra-patellar technique first two technique consider . Regardless side knee needle place , infra-patellar technique position needle patella femur knee extend position examination table . The infra-patellar injection technique use needle endpoint position lie within intertrochlear groove . The medial lateral joint line technique , also know para-patellar technique commonly utilized technique . The para-patellar injection technique route entry knee joint soft spot proximal tibial plateau , either medial lateral side patellar ligament . In para-patellar injection technique needle insertion perform knee flexed 90 degree edge examination table end point within intercondylar notch . The last injection site occasionally use , orientate needle suprapatellar pouch . This route injection time choose due fact reliable region aspirate knee large effusion . Although suprapatellar pouch large potential space knee joint , space essentially close knee lack effusion . Successful injection suprapatellar pouch analogous perfect placement needle two sequential page book . When joint effusion present , space lack tactile stimulus indicate proper needle orientation depth , hence successful injection route difficult unreliable . Another issue plague current knee injection practice choice needle use . The vast majority medical office stock 1.5 inch long needles far common production length available . Obviously lengths available , yet special order type item hand time knee injection . Needle length consideration nearly practitioner perform knee injection . This partially due anatomic misconception intra-articular space wide open easily accessible region depict anatomy text . When inject knee use para-patellar technique important structure needle must pass enter synovial space . Structures pre-patellar bursal tissue , subcutaneous adipose , fascia , infrapatellar fat pad , possibly hypertrophic thicken synovium distinct anatomic structure vary depth quickly use work length standard needle able access intra-articular space . With grow obesity problem America , issue adequate needle length become increasingly important consideration . The current literature regard knee injection seem account require needle length . Numerous study , include one refer protocol utilize needle 2 inch length less , study report low accuracy intra-articular penetrance technique transverse infra-patellar fat pad ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 6 ) . The need accurate placement substrate directly knee joint increase last year popularity proteoglycan hyaluronic acid ( HA ) preparation grow popularity treatment osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Unlike steroid injection largely utilized past symptomatic treatment OA , HA preparation efficiency require accurate placement within synovial pocket knee joint . Briefly difference base upon mechanism action two macromolecule . Steroids function anti-inflammatory mediator , inhibit ability recruitment entry inflammatory cell knee joint . Because , inaccurate deposit steroid injection peri-articular location still result clinical benefit paracrine mechanism ( 7 ) , ( 8 ) . HA preparation make proteoglycans , large negatively charge protein polysaccharide molecule , recruit water joint space articular cartilage . Proteoglycans function like sponge provide hydrodynamic cushion joint weight bearing . Unlike steroid preparation , HA mistakenly inject peri-articular soft tissue , clinical benefit essentially nullify ( 1 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 10 ) . In relation discussion proper needle length , inadvertent placement HA infra-patellar fat pad result short needle result inject material remain within fat pad , unable reach intra-articuar space effective . In 5 subject MRI evaluation size infra-patellar fat pad , Jackson et al . show size variation range 1.8 2.2 inch skin articular surface ( 1 ) . Obviously large sample size require achieve accurate distribution pre-articular soft tissue mass report range add validity importance needle size . Current hyaluronic acid preparation involve series 3-5 injection currently clinical effectiveness pain relief approximately 50 % patient receive series injection . Although study intend test evaluate clinical efficacy HA , fact HA injectate may mistakenly deposit infrapatellar fat pad secondary improper needle length poor technique may important factor low clinical effectiveness . Recently author Jackson ( 1 ) , Wind ( 2 ) Toda ( 6 ) , others report excellent success intra-articular injection infra-patellar approach knee . Their study tout high accuracy deliver substrate intra-articular space . Additionally work show considerably low accuracy intra-articular deposit via one joint line approach . Their article set precedent medical community infra-patellar injection approach . The big concern infra-patellar approach center damage articular cartilage inferior surface patella well trochlear groove femur . There limited space patella femur joint lack effusion . MRI evaluation normal knee joint display 1 - 2 mm potential space needle insert provide joint injection without damage articular cartilage . Radiographs provide false interpretation available free space patellofemoral joint . Indeed articular cartilage resides joint thick produce radiolucent clear region appreciate radiograph . The normal thickness articular cartilage condyles 4.0 3.7 mm medial lateral side respectively . The normal thickness articular cartilage patella 5 mm depth hold distinction thick layer articular cartilage body ( 3 ) . The correct placement injection needle complicate two additional factor , one specific palpable entry point insert needle . A lack definitive palpable entry point result estimation clinical experience provide initial start point . Secondly , infra-patellar injection site definitive palpable end point aid stop insertion needle . This lack end point unfortunately result excessive insertion needle iatrogenic articular trauma produce cut edge needle tip . A second consideration associate report successful nature intra-articular dissemination infrapatellar approach concern `` blowout '' force generate hydrodynamic pressure . Because definitive end point needle insertion region exist needle tip traverse articular cartilage surface , forceful injection , even pre-emptive needle withdrawal , cause dye initially force articular cartilage substrate extravisated articular space . This forced evacuation cartilage due molecular structure hyaline cartilage , collagen fiber orientation , resultant resilience surface shear force . Indeed collagen fiber network restrict absorption fluid 20 % cartilage 's potential volume , fluid resultantly forcefully evacuate extra cellular matrix joint space . ( 4 ) fluid bolus couple cc result cartilage 's inability retain fluid extracellular matrix result `` blowout '' artiticular surface allow release material joint space . Although forceful extravisation provide fluoroscopic evidence successful fluid bolus placement joint space , cost integrity articular cartilage injection site . This contrast accommodating , compliant , hydrophobic nature adipose tissue infrapatellar fat pad tend expand around inject fluid bolis retain injected substrate result fail intra-articular deposit . The observation suggest although infra-patellar approach effectively provide mean injection knee joint 's space , cost articular cartilage author 's opinion unnecessary risk complication . When one considers common HA preparation market today require 3 - 5 total injection , fact repeat intra-articular treatment often provide biannual basis , potential iatrogenic injury quickly multiplies . The goal study present important anatomic consideration consider knee injection perform . Additionally , develop important procedural augments traditional para-patellar injection technique order exceed accuracy safety previously report infra-patellar approach . This study intend directly compare result achieve infra-patellar technique , research refute excellent clinical result achievable infra-patellar technique . The intention study show utilizing specific technique para-patellar knee injection achieve accurate intra-articular deposit 95 % time , considerable improvement previously report result use para-patellar approach ( 1 ) . Additionally technique avoids theoretical iatrogenic injury associate infra-patellar approach . We develop injection technique mechanically similar current technique practice pose additional risk discomfort patient . The basis technique success recognition factor mention . The focus study validate clinical accuracy obtain use technique fluoroscopically confirm visualized confirmation repeat intra-articular deposit . Additionally want document range needle length require properly access knee joint population substantiate importance needle length . Needle length critical factor obese patient large infra-patellar fat pad All intra-articular injection perform , Drs Harold Battenfield Brian Drake . The study population equally divide two investigator inject even number knee . The distribution patient physician randomize base upon time presence . Drs Battenfield Drake alternate `` turn '' first patient inject one physician next sequential patient inject physician significant number injection perform The study population consist patient already receive knee arthroscopy institution . It important note study information keep completely separate isolate operative patient chart . All involved patient issue study number information record do number . All patient involve study sex , height , weight , success attempt insertion record . No name , birthdates , medical record number , specific identifiable information record . This entire procedure perform patient administer general anesthesia customary knee arthroscopy . The injection protocol add less 2 minute surgical time arthroscopy . In order test hypothesis draw 2 cc radiopaque dye ( Isovue dye ) 5 cc syringe attach 6 inch 22 gage spinal needle utilize sterile technique . This injection perform knee schedule arthroscopy . The patient position standard arthroscopy leg immobilizer allow leg hang dependently 90 degree flexed position , mimic typical position would experience office . The anatomic location needle penetration easily find even obese patient simple digital palpation `` soft spot '' exist directly tibial plateau . This soft spot mark small blunt object . We use `` clickable '' retractable ink pen ink cartage retract position provide nice `` bullseye '' demarcation skin surface . Once site mark skin surface cleanse betadine base prepping solution utilize sterile technique . The needle insert predemarcated site , trajectory needle direct toward medial wall lateral femoral condyle , within inter-condylar notch . Insertion needle proceed confirm tactile impact condyle achieve . The depth needle insert skin sterilely mark needle shaft sterile mark pen , length later measure . Without retraction needle 2 cc radiopaque dye inject knee joint . The injection volume 2 cc chosen base upon fact volume fluid commonly package viscosupplimentation ( hyaluronic acid ) preparation . The 2cc volume closely correlate office injection condition . Once dye successfully place within joint , needle remove , joint flexed extend total 10 revolution end extended position . This flexion extension cycle provide opportunity intra-articular injectate disseminate around joint 's surface . At point mobile fluoroscopy utilized visualize knee AP Lateral plane . Evaluation proper placement dye confirm noting extravasation characteristic dye fluoroscopically . Successful injection joint space anticipate result uniform distribution dye along margin femoral condyle , evenly coat joint surface previously report Jackson ( 1 ) , Wind ( 2 ) , Toda ( 6 ) . In contrast , radiopaque dye inject fat pad entirely different radiographic image result . The infra-patellar fat pad act anatomic `` cork '' prevent material inject substance enter knee joint intend go . If needle penetrate synovial membrane low likelihood extra-articular material enter knee joint . This normal anatomic phenomenon body utilize help prevent intra-articular infection . The joint space effect protect region body , much like central nervous system protect blood brain barrier . If injection technique inaccurately place radiopaque dye infra-patellar fat pad , result well circumscribe radiopaque `` blob '' sit extra-articularly easily recognize post-injection floroscopy . Authors Jackson ( 1 ) , Wind ( 2 ) , Toda ( 6 ) show accumulation phenomenon injected substrate infra-patellar fat pad With procedure complete , patient 's leg prepped drape normal standard manner arthroscopy carry would normally perform .</detailed_description>
