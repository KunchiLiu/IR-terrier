	<brief_summary>The purpose project establish Center Excellence Research Obesity focus severe obesity . The prevalence severe obesity ( i.e. , Class 2 3 obesity ; body mass index &gt; 35 kg/m2 40 kg/m2 ) increase rapidly overweight Class 1 obesity . Treatment guideline severe obesity uncertain . Three novel hypothesis regard pathogenesis severe obesity test : ) use non-invasive method measure energy expenditure ; b ) conducting annotated lipomic search bio-markers impaired fat oxidation ; c ) examine role obesity-induced inflammation cause leptin resistance . Responses also measure follow intervention diet activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS The first specific aim examine mechanisms pathogenesis severe obesity . Obesity heterogeneous complex metabolic disorder . The pathogenesis obesity remain obscure unclear individual prone severe obesity . It also unclear ethnic racial difference severe obesity . Many scientist postulate metabolic vulnerability obesity identify severely obese . The 1st specific aim examines pathogenesis severe obesity three research protocol apply within cohort research participant . 1. energy expenditure . Some prior study indicate low rate rest energy expenditure ( REE ) African-Americans , pose metabolic risk weight gain resistance weight loss . Other recent work highlight important role non-exercise activity thermogenesis ( NEAT ) pathogenesis obesity . There limited data address energy expenditure severe obesity . In 120 severely obese adult ( 50 % Class II 50 % Class III ; 50 % African American participation ) , energy expenditure study baseline 6 month intervention . The doubly-labeled water method use measure total daily energy expenditure ( TEE ) . Indirect calorimetry use measure rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) . Physical activity measure use light-weight , wearable monitor . NEAT calculate use measurement . Comparisons group Class II III obesity analysis effect ethnicity . These finding compare data obtain lean control subject . The effect intervention examine . This cohort 1 year intensive behavioral weight loss intervention . Half volunteer randomize combined diet exercise intervention ( DE ) , others randomize diet intervention initial 6 month , add exercise component 6 month ( DE-DELAY ) . 2. impaired capacity fat oxidation . In participant , drop blood obtain baseline 6 month , low-cost , high throughput , yet highly detailed tandem mass spectroscopy profile plasma level acylcarnitines . Elevated level denote disorder fatty acid oxidation selective increase specific acylcarnitine specie denote particular enzymatic locus impairment . This aim derive rapid recent progress two parallel field metabolic investigation . One field `` inborn error metabolism '' , field generally apply newborns child . In field rapid increase past decade recognize delineate in-born error fatty acid oxidation . Profiling plasma level acylcarnitine specie standard diagnostic approach . In obesity research , strong body data develop interval one key metabolic impairment mitochondrial dysfunction reduce capacity fatty acid oxidation skeletal muscle . Racial difference muscle oxidative capacity report , low value oxidative capacity AA woman , characteristic postulate metabolic risk factor obesity . We propose inter-action two line investigation , explore utility tandem mass spectroscopy screen plasma acylcarnitines non-invasive probe metabolic impairment severely obese . 3. leptin resistance . The third protocol use group severely obese concern novel concept leptin resistance . A decade ago , discovery leptin pivotal renew scientific interest obesity . Leptin modulate appetite energy expenditure , two process fundamental weight regulation . Yet , treatment obesity leptin fail meet expectation . This attribute `` leptin resistance '' . This protocol examine role serum leptin interact protein ( SLIPs ) bind leptin factor contribute leptin resistance . This line basic science research indicate one SLIPs C-reactive protein ( CRP ) suggest low-grade inflammation , metabolic complication obesity relate risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) may also contribute pathogenesis obesity . There common theme three protocol form Specific Aim 1 . Each address aspect regulation energy expenditure fat oxidation . Each potential identify novel bio-markers . Each project employ state-of-the-art analytical procedure , yet use minimally invasive sample collection . Finally , carry full research cohort Phase 1 , baseline intervention , compare metabolic effect DE versus DE-DELAY . Though physical activity may important weight loss maintenance induction weight loss , find increase capacity fat oxidation weight loss induce diet . It latter perspective interested comparison DE DE-DELAY 6 month use metabolic parameter . The 2nd specific aim develop effective intervention severely obese . Axiomatic contemporary approach treatment obesity clinically significant benefit obtain modest weight loss . This principle underlie consensus recommendation weight loss target 5 10 % overweight obese individual . The 2nd specific aim implement behavioral dietary physical activity intervention ass whether achieves target weight loss 1 year â‰¥ 7 % Class II Class III obese research participant . 120 adult , describe , 1 year intervention . Intervention increase physical activity severely obese may particularly challenge . Possibly easy period weight loss . The stag diet physical activity ( DE versus DEDELAY ) examine . The 3rd specific aim assess effect intervention adverse health risk . The medical rational weight loss physical activity improve health ameliorate adverse effect obesity . The 3rd specific aim assess impact intervention Phase 1 cohort . A panel standardized clinical measurement , laboratory test , self-report instrument perform baseline , 6 month 1 year . We examine : 1 ) traditional cardiovascular risk factor ( e.g . hypertension , dyslipidemia , glucose insulin , along endocrine measurement ) ; 2 ) marker inflammation , adipokines cytokine ; 3 ) body composition regional distribution adipose tissue ; 4 ) functional status ( time 400 meter corridor walk ) ; 5 ) sub-clinical vascular disease ( pulse wave velocity carotid ultrasound ) ; 7 ) health history use medication ; 8 ) demographic index , social neighborhood factor , quality life , impact obesity , self-perception body image discrimination . One line inquiry concern role baseline characteristic account heterogeneity individual adverse effect severe obesity . The second line inquiry assess impact intervention change parameter .</detailed_description>
