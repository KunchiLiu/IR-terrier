	<brief_summary>The purpose study find certain type Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) scan help well detect marker brain related neuropsychiatric symptom systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . A small percentage patient type lupus experience symptom may result blood clot change blood vessel structure brain . These neuropsychiatric symptom include inability think clearly , change level awake and/or awareness , bad case , seizure stroke . Another goal study find individual fibromyalgia ( FM ) , chronic pain , symptom-related marker scan well . Better early detection marker related acute neuropsychiatric lupus ( NPSLE ) FM helpful affect disease .</brief_summary>
