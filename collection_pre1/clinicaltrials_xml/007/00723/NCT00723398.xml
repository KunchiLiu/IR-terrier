	<brief_summary>The overall hypothesis combination low dose antiestrogen Raloxifene omega-3 fatty acid exert synergistic breast cancer chemopreventive effect due crosstalk downstream cellular effect lead decreased proliferation increase apoptosis premalignant mammary cell . Based investigator hypothesis upregulation functional estrogen receptor premalignant lesion also responsible development hormone independent tumor , investigator postulate combination antiestrogens omega-3 fatty acid reduce development hormone-dependent -independent tumor . At present , know intervention able decrease development hormone-independent tumor , prevalent , aggressive , leading patient 's demise . In addition , investigator postulate approach safe since combine lower hence less toxic dose Raloxifene administration omega-3 fatty acid know health benefit , i.e. , reduction cardiovascular risk , beyond possible chemo preventive effect breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective study determine individual combine effect Raloxifene omega-3 fatty acid surrogate marker breast cancer development healthy , postmenopausal woman . The primary endpoint mammographic density study power . Breast density major risk factor breast cancer hence choose evaluate potential chemopreventive efficacy intervention . Secondary endpoint would include marker oxidative stress , parameter estrogen metabolism , marker inflammation , marker IGF-I signaling , show literature influence mammary carcinogenesis . Study Population : Healthy , postmenopausal woman age 35-70 year , undergo yearly mammogram part routine screening practice . Method Identification Subjects/Samples/Medical Records : Women report yearly mammogram consider protocol . They give first screen questionnaire rule co-existing medical condition would predispose thromboembolic event .</detailed_description>
