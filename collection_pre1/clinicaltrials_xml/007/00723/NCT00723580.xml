	<brief_title>Actigraphic Analysis Treatment Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Actigraphic measurement record every 30 second record 11 day baseline period , follow 10 day period initial pharmacological intervention . The non-invasive nature watch-like actigraphy device particularly attractive use pediatric population . Meaningful treatment response measurement obtain actigraphic data combine psychometric observational repeat measurement . Subsequent initial data collection parent consent child assent extend study continue measurement . The case study include baseline repeat psychological , observational actigraphic measurement initiate prior treatment risperidone repeat throughout treatment process final data collect July 2010 . The Personality Inventory Children ( PIC ) objective multidimensional measurement affect , behavior , ability family function . The PIC administer prior treatment risperidone repeat 22 month treatment . The PIC serve actuarial pre-treatment diagnostic tool well post-treatment repeat measurement indicate treatment associate change . A primary observer ( mother ) train report symptom percentages present since previous observation utilize operationally define observer defined item systematic observation scale throughout treatment process . Actigraphic measurement provide basis measure sleep sleep onset latency well period mobility immobility . When programmed record activity every thirty second , thousand measurement quickly capture . Actigraphic measurement make utilizing watch-like actigraphic device 11 day baseline actigraphic measurement period continue measurement include initiation Once-Daily , Bedtime ( q.h.s . ) pharmacological intervention 6 day , follow plan adjustment Twice Day ( b.i.d . ) dose measure additional 4 day . Repeated actigraphic study subsequently conduct 22 month risperidone treatment collect along repeat observational psychometric data . This case study explore activity sleep characteristic related behavioral characteristic treatment response utility single subject repeat actigraphic , psychometric observational measurement monitor treatment response .</detailed_description>
