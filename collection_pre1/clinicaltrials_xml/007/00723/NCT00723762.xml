	<brief_title>Valproic Acid-associated Hypoalbuminemia Medically Fragile Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Valproic acid ( VPA ) long-chain fatty acid frequently use antiepileptic agent pediatric adult seizure patient . Other adverse effect associate VPA use include hepatic steatosis , alter mitochondrial function decrease concentration serum protein . The exact mechanism mechanism VPA induces associate adverse drug effect fully understood though multiple theory postulate include impaired vesicle transport within hepatocyte , inhibition hepatic synthetic metabolic pathways renal protein loss . Decreased serum albumin concentration concomitant VPA use identify multiple study . Albumin synthesis sensitive tryptophan concentration ( amino acid also able stimulate albumin synthesis ) , oncotic pressure near synthetic site , energy supply albumin release hepatocyte sensitive intrahepatocellular potassium concentration . Based available literature , VPA appear inhibit enzyme ( ) either directly indirectly involve albumin synthesis albumin gene expression . VPA known inhibit urea cycle , include patient ornithine-transcarbamylase ( OTC ) deficiency , possibly inhibit mitochondrial carbamoyl-phosphate synthase . Oratz et al discuss potential correlation urea cycle albumin synthesis identify administration various amino acid increase albumin urea synthesis . Ornithine intermediate amino acid within urea cycle also precursor polyamines show increase degree aggregation polysomes , responsible protein synthesis , bound endoplasmic reticulum . Thus , VPA may indirectly inhibit protein synthesis interfere urea cycle lead decreased ornithine concentration subsequently decrease polyamine concentration decrease number bind polysomes result alteration albumin synthesis release . The purpose study investigate potential mechanism VPA-associated hypoalbuminemia medically fragile pediatric young adult epileptic patient long-term care facility .</detailed_description>
