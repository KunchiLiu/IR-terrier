This intervention design establish enhance development intentional communication prior onset spoken language child language delay disorder .

Our preliminary research use randomize experimental design test effect intervention deliver small 'dose ' , average one hour per week six month . This standard dose lead significant modest effect child 's use intentional communication early language , could adopt speech-language pathologist part standard care . Unfortunately , early benefit always maintain 6 12 month therapy phase end always benefit child .
