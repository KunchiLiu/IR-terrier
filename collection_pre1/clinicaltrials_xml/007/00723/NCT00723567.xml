	<brief_title>A Novel Mutation Spectrin Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mutations spectrin ( Sp ) involve Sp heterodimer self-association site ( I domain Sp ) represent common group membrane skeletal defect hereditary elliptocytosis ( HE ) closely related disorder , hereditary pyropoikilocytosis ( HPP ) . HPP characterize extreme anisocytic microcytosis , severe spectrin dimer self-association defect spectrin deficiency . The conventional explanation different phenotype HPP subject compound heterozygotes sp defect interferes sp tetramer assembly second defect result decrease synthesis functional sp . In contrast , HE subject normal spectrin content less severe sp self-association defect . The clinical expression HE/HPP influence inheritance modifying factor Sp hypomorphic mutation , LELY . LELY low expression allele Sp gene characterize C &gt; G mutation codon 1857 exon 40 C &gt; T -12 mutation intron 45 responsible partial skip exon 46 , essential functional assembly /b sp dimer . CASE REPORT : Here describe four member family northern European descent member different erythrocyte morphology range atypical HPP HE normal novel Sp mutation . Quantitation RBC membrane protein propositus atypical non-microcytic HPP reveal 48 % spectrin dimer ( control 10 % ) due mark increase 74kD I Sp peptide . There slight decrease spectrin/band 3 ratio , correlate normocytic morphology . There also abnormal Sp peptide 41kD suggest presence LELY . Sequencing Sp gene reveal heterozygosity novel mutation exon 2 , codon 34 : CGG- &gt; CCG ( Arg &gt; Pro ) heterozygosity LELY . These mutation also present brother daughter HE , another son , Arg34Pro , LELY repeatedly confirm normal morphology . We plan screen 11 family member suspect HPP HE . Blood sample obtain follow perform : 1 . Quantitation erythrocyte ( RBC ) membrane proteins 2 . DNA extraction WBC screen spectrin mutation restriction enzyme ( need sequence spectrin gene ) 3 . Quantitative Real Time PCR test do RNA ass spectrin gene expression 4 . History , Clinical examination , CBC , chemistry peripheral blood smear Quantitation RBC membrane proteins do look abnormal increase amount spectrin dimer patient HPP ( control 10 % ) . We also look DNA know yet unreported mutation spectrin gene correlate expression spectrin gene wrt level spectrin protein RNA . No statistical analysis do . This observation study design correlate clinical feature mention test result .</detailed_description>
