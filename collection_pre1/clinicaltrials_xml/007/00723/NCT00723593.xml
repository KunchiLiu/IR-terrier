	<brief_summary>This study determine best location biopsy gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract early accurate diagnosis GI graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) . ( A biopsy surgical removal small piece tissue examination microscope . ) GVHD life-threatening complication stem cell transplantation donor immune cell destroy patient healthy tissue . It commonly affect skin , liver GI tract . This study establish best biopsy tissue GI tract study tissue try explore GI GVD occur may possible good diagnose treat . Patients 18 year age old undergone undergo stem cell transplantation high risk develop GI GVHD may eligible study . Participants may enter study transplant procedure later develop GVHD symptom . Participants undergo follow test procedure : I . Before start condition chemotherapy radiation therapy transplantation - Medical history physical examination - Sigmoidoscopy ( endoscopy low part large intestine ) biopsies - Blood draw - Stool sample collection II . Two 3 week condition regimen - Sigmoidoscopy biopsy - Blood draw - Stool sample collection III . 30 , 45 , 60 90 day transplantation -Blood draw IV . After complete test part II appearance GI symptom suspect due GVHD - Updated medical history physical examination - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( endoscopy esophagus , stomach upper small intestine ) - Colonoscopy ( endoscopy entire part large intestine ) biopsies - Blood draw - Stool collection V. Two week start therapy patient diagnose GVHD - Sigmoidoscopy biopsy - Blood draw - Stool sample collection - PET/CT scan select patient ( nuclear medicine x-ray imaging GI tract</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Pathophysiology Gastrointestinal Graft-versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) affect 70 % patient undergo stem cell transplantation . GVHD associate significant morbidity mortality , commonly affect skin , liver , gastrointestinal ( GI ) system . Gastrointestinal ( GI ) manifestation GVHD include anorexia , nausea , vomit , abdominal pain , diarrhea . In patient GI GVHD , extent gut involvement relationship underlie symptom unclear . Furthermore , diagnosis require histologic evaluation entail cumbersome invasive endoscopic procedure tissue procurement . Histologic finding support diagnosis nonspecific poor sensitivity specificity . Treatment GI GVHD also nonspecific , many systemic side effect account large portion associate morbidity mortality . Such uncertainty regard diagnosis treatment GI GVHD stem lack understand pathophysiology disease . Cytokines produce T lymphocyte , mononuclear phagocyte , natural killer cell show play integral role regulation tissue damage . Human study perform date examine peripheral blood cytokine , result conflict little clinical correlation . Current analysis gut tissue limit mostly animal subject little correlation human . The primary objective study identify area GI tract biopsied would achieve high yield diagnosis GI GVHD . This accomplish perform esophagogastroduodenoscopy , colonoscopy , ileoscopy post transplant patient GI symptom , suspect due GVHD . Endoscopic biopsy evaluate single designate GI pathologist make diagnosis GVHD . A novel application quantitative histological apoptotic assay evaluate blinded fashion diagnostic utility . A GVHD diagnostic yield rate area GI tract primary outcome measure . Other biopsy obtain baseline , follow condition regimen well therapy GI GVHD use achieve secondary objective understand immune response underlie GI GVHD . A comprehensive evaluation inflammatory milieu gut tissue achieve use immunohistochemistry flow cytometric immunophenotyping mucosal mononuclear cell microarray , qRT-PCR ELISA mucosal cytokine . Other secondary objective include evaluation serum proteomic pattern analysis , serum citrulline , fecal calprotectin 18F-FDG PET/CT noninvasive diagnosis GI GVHD . Better understand pathophysiology GI GVHD allow u develop focused effective diagnostic therapeutic option less invasive few systemic side effect lead reduced morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
