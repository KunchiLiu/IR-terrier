	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect give bevacizumab together temsirolimus see well work treat patient recurrent persistent endometrial cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need growth . Giving bevacizumab together temsirolimus may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity bevacizumab temsirolimus , term 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) objective tumor response , patient recurrent persistent endometrial cancer . II . To determine nature degree toxicity regimen patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration PFS overall survival patient treat regimen . II . To determine effect prognostic factor ( i.e. , performance status , histological subtype , grade ) patient treat regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare proportion patient objective tumor response PFS 6 month receive combination bevacizumab temsirolimus single agent bevacizumab temsirolimus use historical control . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV day 1 15 temsirolimus IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , total 5 year .</detailed_description>
