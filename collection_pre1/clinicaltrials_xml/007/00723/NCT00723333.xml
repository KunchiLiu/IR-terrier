	<detailed_description>Primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) among Philadelphia Chromosome Negative Myeloproliferative Disorders . This diagnosis present patient 's initial diagnosis arise precede Polycythemia Vera Essential Thrombocythemia . While clinical course variable , define vary degree splenomegaly , anemia , fatigue constitutional symptom . Patients PMF increase risk acute leukemia , bone marrow failure thrombosis . Currently , curative treatment PMF allogeneic stem cell transplant . However , median age diagnosis mid late 60 , patient longer candidate transplant due age and/or comorbid illness . Unfortunately , treatment PMF palliative nature often limited efficacy . Over last several year , many advance occur increased safety improve outcomes allogeneic transplant . Perhaps important ongoing refinement reduce intensity conditioning ( RIC ) regimens prior transplant . Over last year , many group publish data suggest RIC transplant effective treatment PMF felt potentially curative procedure . However , vast majority data report person young 65 year old . The current protocol RIC transplant PMF available University Utah exclude patient old age 65 . We would like see sufficient successful experience transplant person older 60 year old ( include many old 65 year age ) justify creation clinical trial use RIC regimen old age group . We review medical record approximately 30 patient four different institution : - University Utah/Huntsman Cancer Hospital - Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center - Baylor College Medicine - M.D . Anderson Cancer Centers We evaluate : engraftment rate , relapse rate , disease free survival , overall survival , cause death pertinent statistic . We compare outcomes appropriate historical control . We hypothesize RIC regimen may justifiably safe old patient PMF hope data allow development corollary clinical trial .</detailed_description>
