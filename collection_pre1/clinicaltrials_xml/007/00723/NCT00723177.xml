	<brief_title>Phase IIa Study AV411 , Glial Activation Inhibitor , Opioid Withdrawal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opioid-induced cytokine release glial activation propose directly contribute affective physiological aspect withdrawal . Furthermore , cytokine release follow opioid administration hypothesize limit factor duration magnitude opioid-induced analgesia . The two primary goal study assess AV411 's ability 1 ) reduce opioid-withdrawal syndrome 2 ) increase prolong analgesic effect mu-opioid agonist , oxycodone . To explore whether AV411 decrease opioid-induced glial cell activation , participant assign placebo high dose AV411 group ( n = 6 dose condition ) study twice [ 11C ] PK11195 , positron emission tomography ( PET ) radiotracer use measure peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) human brain . The PBR receptor locate mitochondrion microglia use examine microglial activation various brain region .</detailed_description>
