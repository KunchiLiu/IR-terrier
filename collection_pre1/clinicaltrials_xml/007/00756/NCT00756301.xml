	<brief_summary>Interventional spine procedure increasingly popular mean diagnosis treatment spine disease . By convention , local anesthetic use begin procedure goal minimize pain . However , infiltration local anesthetic painful . This initial painful stimulus heighten pain awareness cause anxiety excessive movement procedure . The purpose study determine patient discomfort administration cutaneous local anesthetic prior interventional spine procedure compare anesthetic administration different gauge procedural needle . Another purpose determine patient discomfort administration local anesthetic traditional technique compare alternative technique develop standardized technique criterion local anesthetic administration spine injection procedure minimize patient pain , may help reduce overall risk procedure . We plan enroll total 200-300 subject come Stanford symmetric bilateral single injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Any patient refer treat physician symmetric bilateral single injection ( example , bilateral transforaminal epidural injection , bilateral facet injection , bilateral SI joint injection , etc . ) provide write informed consent procedure conduct . The content consent form use explain study patient . Patients pregnancy , coagulopathy , systemic infection , allergy contrast dye , mentally disabled unable give inform consent exclude study . Three different cutaneous local anesthetic technique investigate , hereafter refer ( ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , describe detail : 1 . Local anesthetic inject 27-gauge 1.25 '' needle use traditional technique- formation subcutaneous wheal 0.25cc 1 % Lidocaine , 0.75cc 1 % Lidocaine inject along plan needle trajectory hub depth 27-gauge needle . 2 . Local anesthetic inject 27-gauge 1.25 '' needle use alternative technique- needle immediately insert plan needle trajectory hub depth . Then 1cc 1 % Lidocaine inject slowly needle withdrawn skin create small point wheal skin prior removal needle . 3 . No local anesthetic use . 1 . Patients randomly assign receive one three possible combination anesthetic technique ( one side i.e . ( ) &amp; ( b ) , ( ) &amp; ( c ) , ( b ) &amp; ( c ) . Randomized assignment occur rotate basis , i.e . ; patient # 1 receive ( ) &amp; ( b ) , patient # 2 receive ( ) &amp; ( c ) , patient # 3 receive ( b ) &amp; ( c ) , . Regardless technique ( ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , follow four step follow . 2 . After start point procedure identify , placement needle , ask patient take note subsequent discomfort pain . 3 . Complete designate anesthesia technique . 4 . Next , place treatment needle depth 1 inch . Needle size determine injectionist time procedure , base determine best suit patient procedure follow quinke point needle : 26-gauge 3.5 '' , 25-gauge 3.5 '' , 22-gauge 3.5 '' needle . The size needle use side . 5 . Finally , ask patient rate 10 point verbal analog scale amount pain experienced time . 6 . Repeat step 2 thru 5 second side procedure . All data collect procedure . There follow-up visit procedure .</detailed_description>
