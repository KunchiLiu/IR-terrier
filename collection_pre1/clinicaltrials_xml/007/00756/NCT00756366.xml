	<brief_summary>Heart failure affect approximately 5-6 million North Americans increase prevalence . Sleep-related disorder , obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) often coexist ( 11-37 % incidence ) heart failure . OSA repeat temporary interruption breathe sleep occurs air passages upper respiratory tract become blocked sleep . OSA adversely affect cardiovascular system result hypoxia ( decrease oxygen supply ) , decrease oxygen supply heart . Patients OSA treat continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . It also show CPAP reduces angina sleep , minimize sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) activation improve leave ventricular ( LV ) function , although mechanism action clear . Carbon-11 acetate PET imaging allow assessment heart work efficiently heart use oxygen certain circumstance . Carbon-11 hydroxyephedrine ( HED ) measure cardiac nervous system activity , may effect heart rate . The study evaluate term effect continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , common treatment patient OSA , heart 's efficiency ability work effect nervous system activity heart . Two patient group evaluate 1 . ) patient congestive heart failure obstructive sleep apnea randomize early late CPAP address primary hypothesis study 2 . ) patient congestive heart failure ( match control group ) . Both primary randomized study group secondary study group evaluate use [ 11C ] acetate PET , [ 11C ] HED PET echocardiography . Measurements obtain baseline , 1 week ( possible ) 6-8 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OSA heart failure ( HF ) state increase afterload , metabolic demand sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) activation . In patient OSA HF , CPAP initially may reduce LV stroke volume ( SV ) subsequently improve LV function . This may relate early beneficial effect myocardial energetics early reduction metabolic demand subsequently lead improved efficiency LV contraction . However , clear whether CPAP favourably affect cardiac energetics . Any benefit may also relate reduce SNS activation CPAP therapy . However effect myocardial SN function also well study . We propose evaluate temporal effect CPAP daytime 1 ) oxidative metabolism ; 2 ) WMI estimate mechanical efficiency ; 3 ) myocardial SN pre-synaptic function ; 4 ) HR variability patient OSA HF . We also determine whether parameter alter compare group patient HF without OSA . In conjunction echocardiographic measure LV stroke work , PET derive [ 11C ] acetate kinetics use measure oxidative metabolism , determine work metabolic index ( WMI ) . [ 11C ] HED retention use measure cardiac SN pre-synaptic function . HYPOTHESES Primary Hypotheses : In patient chronic stable HF OSA , 6-8 week ' CPAP demonstrate : 1. beneficial effect daytime myocardial metabolism lead reduction rate oxidative metabolism measure [ 11C ] acetate kinetics use PET imaging ; 2. improvement energy transduction oxidative metabolism stroke work measure increase daytime work-metabolic index . Secondary Hypotheses : In patient chronic stable heart failure OSA , 1 . CPAP lead early ( 1 week '' ) reduction daytime oxidative metabolism precedes improvement work-metabolic index , indicate early energy spar effect ; 2 . CPAP lead ) increase daytime myocardial SN pre-synaptic function measure increase [ 11C ] HED retention PET imaging , ii ) parallel decrease sympathetic increase vagal modulation sino-atrial discharge ( i.e . heart rate ( HR ) variability ) 3. impaired daytime myocardial oxidative metabolism , work-metabolic index , myocardial sympathetic nerve function compare patient heart failure without OSA . 'original protocol indicate 1 month follow change 6-8 week order accommodate patient logistics image centre scheduling . ''Logistics permit patient complete 1 week scan .</detailed_description>
