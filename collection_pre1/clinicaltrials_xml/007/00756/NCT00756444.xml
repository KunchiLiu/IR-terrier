	<brief_title>A Randomized Phase 2 Pharmacokinetic Trial Chemotherapy With Without Panitumumab Patients With Metastatic and/or Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Phase : 2 Indication : Metastatic and/or Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck Primary Objective : To estimate effect administration 9 mg/kg Q3W panitumumab area curve ( AUC ) total plasma cisplatin-derived platinum level average concentration steady state ( Css ) 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) subject receive cisplatin 5-FU . Secondary Objective ( ) : To estimate effect administration 9 mg/kg Q3W panitumumab maximum concentration ( Cmax ) total plasma cisplatin-derived platinum level , AUC Cmax free plasma cisplatin-derived platinum subject receive cisplatin 5-FU . Hypotheses : This estimation sub-study rather formal hypothesis test , follow estimate : 1 . The effect administration 9 mg/kg Q3W panitumumab steady state pharmacokinetics cisplatin estimate base ratio AUC : without panitumumab total plasma cisplatin-derived platinum level . Total plasma cisplatin-derived platinum level focus since show literature correlation total plasma cisplatin-derived platinum level nephrotoxicity tumor response ( Desoize et al , 1991 ) . 2 . The effect administration 9 mg/kg Q3W panitumumab steady state pharmacokinetics 5-FU assess base average concentration steady state ( Css ) 5-FU . Study Design : Study 20080008 PK study . This study design estimate effect panitumumab PK cisplatin 5-FU subject receive cisplatin 5-FU without panitumumab . To maximize potential effect panitumumab PK cisplatin 5-FU , collection PK sample cisplatin 5-FU take cycle 2 study , point PK panitumumab expect steady-state dose 9 mg/kg give every 3 week . Primary Secondary Endpoints : The primary endpoint study ratio geometric mean ( : without panitumumab ) AUC total plasma cisplatin-derived platinum average concentration steady sate ( Css ) 5-FU measured cycle 2 time panitumumab level anticipate steady state . Secondary endpoint ratio geometric mean ( : without panitumumab ) 1 ) Cmax total plasma cisplatin-derived platinum 2 ) Cmax AUC free plasma cisplatin-derived platinum measure cycle 2 . Sample Size : Approximately 45 subject participate Study 20080008 . At least fifteen evaluable subject ( defined provide sufficient PK sample permit calculation AUC total plasma cisplatin-derived platinum average concentration steady state 5-FU cycle 2 ) per arm require . Additional subject sequentially include least fifteen evaluable subject per arm achieve . It therefore estimate approximately 45 subject need participate study obtain 30 evauable subject .</detailed_description>
