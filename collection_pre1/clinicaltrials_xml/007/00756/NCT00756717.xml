	<brief_summary>The purpose research project study effect research ( investigational ) drug , MK-0752 combine either tamoxifen letrozole breast cancer cell . Tamoxifen letrozole standard hormone treatment use treat breast cancer positive estrogen receptor . However , time breast cancer cell become resistant tamoxifen letrozole . MK-0752 class drug call gamma secretase inhibitor . Gamma secretase inhibitor may play role reverse resistance drug tamoxifen letrozole .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of MK-0752 In Combination With Tamoxifen Or Letrozole Treat Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES To evaluate safety tolerability gamma-secretase inhibitor MK-0752 pre-surgical setting patient early stage , estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive breast cancer , combination tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) . To establish feasibility success multi-laboratory collaboration evaluate clinical specimen biomarker test . To provide preliminary data impact MK-0752 panel biomarkers involve notch signal pathway .</detailed_description>
