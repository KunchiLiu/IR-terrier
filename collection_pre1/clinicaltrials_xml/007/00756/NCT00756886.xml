	<brief_title>Does Atorvastatin Prevent Post Operative Atrial Fibrillation After Pulmonary Resection : A Randomized Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence atrial arrhythmia thoracic , non-cardiac procedure exceedingly common report occur 10-39 % patient . It show increase majority morbidity also delay hospital discharge . Recent study suggest one week pre-operative atorvastatin may reduce incidence post-operative atrial arrhythmia patient undergo cardiac surgery multi-institutional study currently underway examine concept . However , publish prospective randomize study date evaluate effectiveness atorvastatin reduce atrial arrhythmia patient undergo thoracic , non-cardiac operation esophagectomy pulmonary resection . The object study determine atorvastatin reduces incidence atrial arrhythmia ( atrial fibrillation flutter ) follow non-cardiac thoracic surgery , specifically pulmonary resection .</detailed_description>
