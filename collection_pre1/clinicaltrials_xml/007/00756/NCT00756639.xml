	<brief_title>Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation ( PCI ) Small Cell Carcinoma Urothelium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnancy Test : Women able child must negative urine pregnancy test eligible study . MRI/CT Scans : Within six ( 6 ) week whole brain radiation , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan brain check brain tumor develop . Simulation Visit : Before radiation therapy begin , `` simulation visit '' plan radiation therapy . During session , fit plastic mask hold head still radiation . The mask make material call `` thermoplastic '' become soft place warm water . While plastic soft , pull face make mold . When plastic cool , harden mask complete . After mask make , CT scan head do treatment planning . Radiation Therapy : You begin radiation within 1 week simulation visit . You radiation visit Monday Friday 3 week ( 15 total therapy visit ) . Each therapy session last 15 minute . It take study staff 10 minute position table put mask . The radiation give 2-3 minute . On first day week therapy , brain X-ray see radiation give best area . Follow-Up : After radiation therapy , MRI CT scan brain every 6 month 1 year every year 5 year check status disease . More frequent scan perform doctor think need . You also complete write mental status exam doctor every 3-6 month 2 year every year 5 year . The exam series test check memory ability follow instruction . The test take 15 minute complete . Length Study : You may remain study long benefitting . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . The use radiation check brain tumor form investigational . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically proven small cell carcinoma bladder , elsewhere along urothelium , locally advanced metastatic ( i.e . &gt; = cT3b , &gt; = pT3b , N+ , M+ ) time presentation cystectomy treat chemotherapy . 2 . Patients must response chemotherapy , investigator feel likely result systemic control cancer . In instance , would reflect major response ( i.e . &gt; = 90 % reduction tumor ) , though low percentage may acceptable investigator feel residual reflect another component , transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) . Dr Arlene SiefkerRadtke serve final arbiter question regard response arise . 3 . Since small cell tumor bladder often associate variant histology include TCC adenocarcinoma , presence variant histology allow . 4 . Patients must &gt; = 18 year age . 5 . Patients may trials ( either M.D . Anderson Cancer Center outside institution ) long eligibility criterion meet . 6 . Patients must evidence progressive disease time study entry . 7 . Patients must MRI CT head show CNS metastasis within 6 week study entry . 8 . Patients must adequate physiologic reserve evidence : ) Zubrod Performance Status ( PS ) &lt; = 2 ; b ) Adequate bone marrow reserve evidence ANC &gt; 1000 , platelet count &gt; 75,000 . Supranormal value judge benign inconsequential etiology acceptable . 9 . Patients must enrol within 6 month complete chemotherapy surgery primary site . Any acute/subacute &gt; = grade 3 toxicity chemotherapy must resolve &lt; = grade 2 time study entry . It suggest patient undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation soon recover chemotherapy surgery , minimum 2 week , 6 month follow chemotherapy surgery . 1 . Patients CNS metastasis presentation eligible . 2 . History TIA stroke within 6 month study entry . 3 . Prior cranial irradiation . 4 . Pregnant woman eligible ; woman childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test start therapy .</criteria>
