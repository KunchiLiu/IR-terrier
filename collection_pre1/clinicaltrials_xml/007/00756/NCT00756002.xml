	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Ramelteon Subjects With Chronic Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In western world , several people affect chronic insomnia . Numerous study estimate 30 % 40 % general population affect time life form insomnia go several month , one third describe severely affected . Daytime symptoms insomnia include tiredness , lack energy , difficulty concentrate irritability . Recent epidemiologic research focus quality life identify significant insomnia-related morbidity relate work productivity , health care utilization , risk depression . Insomnia associate diminished work output , absenteeism , great rate accident . Although normal control sleep-wake cycle exert suprachiasmatic nucleus via melatonin receptor subtype 1 2 ( MT1 MT2 ) receptor ( melatonin receptor subtype ) , current pharmacologic treatment insomnia mainly involve GABAergic ( gamma-aminobutyric acid ) mechanism . Most currently prescribe sleep agent benzodiazepine receptor agonist , induce sleep binding benzodiazepine receptor site gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor complex . Gamma-aminobutyric acid major inhibitory transmitter central nervous system , receptor distribute widely throughout brain . In addition sleep , benzodiazepine receptor agonist cause wide range ancillary effect directly relate sleep , depend precise subset gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor activate . These include sedative , anxiolytic , muscle-relaxant , amnesic effect . The risk tolerance , dependence development , abuse potential associate benzodiazepine receptor agonist also may reflect effect drug gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor complex . The sleep-wake cycle result interaction circadian homeostatic mechanism . The homeostatic mechanism refers accumulation sleep load time awake ; organism fall asleep sleep load high , reduction sleep load sleep result wake . A circadian rhythm superimpose homeostatic mechanism . Circadian rhythm control suprachiasmatic nucleus , emit alert signal ; signal believe attenuated melatonin , produce response darkness . It believe bind melatonin MT1 MT2 receptor suprachiasmatic nucleus inhibits fire specific neuron , think attenuate alert signal , allow homeostatic mechanism express promote sleep . An agent selective MT1 MT2 receptor would expect devoid ancillary effect agent act gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor complex . It would promote sleep specifically target alert signal suprachiasmatic nucleus , allow homeostatic mechanism produce sleep . Ramelteon global development Takeda Pharmaceuticals nonscheduled sleep agent treatment difficulty sleep initiation , market brand name Rozerem™ United States . In vitro , ramelteon demonstrate affinity selectivity human melatonin MT1 MT2 receptor compare melatonin . It also demonstrate full agonist activity cell express human MT1 MT2 receptor relative melatonin . In European Union , Takeda seek marketing approval long-term treatment transient chronic insomnia characterize difficulty sleep onset . Because European clinical study date use 8 mg dose , aim study assess safety efficacy 4mg ramelteon large number adult chronic insomnia . Subjects participate study require report sleep laboratory polysomnography recording two consecutive night three sitting five week period . The total duration study approximately 10 week .</detailed_description>
