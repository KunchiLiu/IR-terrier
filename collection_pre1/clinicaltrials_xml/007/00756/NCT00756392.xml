	<detailed_description>This study design investigate whether fill rectum high density barium prior magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) exam prostate improves quality acquire spectrum . It expect dense substance help prevent air enter rectum thus susceptibility artifact obtain MRS data reduce . Ten patient localized prostate cancer recruit study . There change treatment planning base MRS study . Patient receive standard radiation treatment prescribe radiation oncologist . An MRS study patient 's prostate conduct 3 Tesla Philips Intera NMR ( Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ) scanner fill rectum barium . Patients request take mild laxative choice night exam , eat 2-4 hour prior scan . To facilitate , patient 's exam book prior lunch . Prior exam , patient ask empty bladder 40 mg Buscopan administer patient ( i.m . i.v . ) reduce peristalsis , presence degrades quality NMR scan . The patient lie board design fit MR scanner patient bed hold one element dual element phase array radiofrequency ( RF ) coil place . The patient position prostate within coil 's field view ( preferably along central axis ) ; , patient lie one element coil element place top patient abdomen . An abdominal restraint place around patient abdomen reduce breathe effect . After patient center magnet , MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) image acquire identify tumor location . The position MRS voxel prostate carefully determine aid radiation oncologist . Preparation scan spectroscopy acquisition carry prior apply PRESS ( Point RESolved Spectroscopy ) sequence employ obtain proton ( 1H ) spectrum prostate . The entire scan duration preparation till completion approximately 30 minute ( 5 minute patient positioning , 10 minute image voxel placement , 5 minute spectroscope sequence preparation scan , 10 minute spectrum acquisition ) . Following scan completion , patient 150 mL Barium solution administer rectum . After stand 3-4 minute , patient like back NMR scanner bed NMR procedure repeat . The spectrum acquire without presence Barium solution rectum compare see latter situation indeed advantageous .</detailed_description>
