	<brief_title>Using Bio Markers Predict Disease Recurrence Cognitive Function High Risk Breast Ca</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACT Background : Women locally advance breast cancer ( LABC ) , woman high risk ( T2-3/N+4 , triple negative ) yet operable breast cancer , undergo combine treatment include chemotherapy , surgery , irradiation , hormonal treatment . These treatment decrease chance recurrence cancer , associate several side effect , include cognitive difficulty . About one third breast cancer patient treat chemotherapy report sustain decline thinking ability ( 'chemofog ' ) treatment . The cause cognitive decline know . However recent information : ( ) people cancer may high level cytokine inflammatory molecule blood ; ( ii ) injection cytokine animal , use treat human disease , lead problem memory cognitive ability ; ( iii ) survivor breast cancer high cytokine level evidence cancer still active ( iv ) advance cancer different cytokine inflammatory marker prognostic information disease outcome . Genetic polymorphism neuronal protein ( APOe , BDNF , COMT ) predictive cognitive decline non-cancer population ) . Objective : This longitudinal study determine whether serum level cytokine inflammatory marker related 1 ) cognitive dysfunction ; 2 ) recurrence disease woman LABC/High Risk . Method : In 120 woman LABC/High risk relation cytokine inflammatory marker cancer recurrence evaluate ; blood drawn pre-chemotherapy , pre-surgery 1 2 year diagnosis . In subset 60 woman LABC/high risk , cognitive performance evaluate similar time blood drawn . Similarly , control group 60 healthy woman evaluate cytokine cognitive performance . We also evaluate predictive role polymorphism gene encode neuronal protein APOe , BDNF , COMT cognitive impairment . Data Analysis : The impact cytokine level inflammatory marker cognitive performance time evaluate use mixed model regression . Multivariate model apply assess impact LABC/high risk chemotherapy cognitive function . Cox proportional-hazard model evaluate relationship cytokine blood marker Time-To-Progression identify variable predict reoccurrence . Hypotheses : Cytokines inflammatory marker related cognitive impairment disease outcome woman locally advance high risk operable breast cancer . Genetic polymorphism neuronal protein ( APOe , BDNF , COMT ) predictive increase cognitive decline diagnose treatment cancer . Implications : Increased knowledge cause cognitive problem woman breast cancer allow development strategy prevent minimize unpleasant symptom . Cytokines biomarkers might predictive disease outcome woman breast cancer use tailor adjuvant treatment potential target development new therapy .</detailed_description>
