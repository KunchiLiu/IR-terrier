	<brief_summary>Cocaine dependence insidious disease underscore powerful proclivity relapse despite individual 's ability recognize deleterious consequence continue drug use . To date , limited number treatment , FDA approve medication treatment cocaine dependence . Attempts find reliable successful treatment cocaine dependence may mar gender difference brain chemistry , structure , function manifest drug crave relapse . For example , cue , drug exposure , stress promote relapse , yet female appear susceptible stress induce relapse , male may susceptible cue induce relapse . Therefore identify neural substrate involve process valence internal external stimulus may provide insight cocaine dependence provide effective therapeutic strategy aim prevent relapse . Corticotropin release hormone ( CRH ) pharmacological activator hypothalamic pituitary adrenal ( HPA ) axis , implicated stress induce drug relapse . Corticotropin release hormone receptor locate extrahypothalamic brain nuclei implicate determine significance internal ( somatic ) external ( environmental ) stimulus . The primary directive pilot project utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) identify possible brain nuclei associated stress induce drug crave cocaine dependent female .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Age 1865 2 . Righthanded 3 . Males female meet criterion cocaine dependence ( DSMIV ) , within past three month ( current ) . 4 . Subjects must able provide inform consent function intellectual level sufficient allow accurate completion assessment instrument . 5 . Subjects must consent remain abstinent drug abuse ( except nicotine ) threeday period immediately prior GCRC admission . Nicotine dependence affect HPA function therefore would ideal exclude subject nicotine use . Because comorbidity cocaine nicotine dependence , would seriously compromise feasibility recruitment . Alcohol also know affect HPA function , however enhance recruitment effort , individual alcohol dependence abuse include study require medically supervised detoxification . 6 . Participants must negative breathalyzer , urine drug screen . 7 . Subjects must consent outpatient admission GCRC 1 . Subjects evidence history significant hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , neurological disease include diabetes , condition may affect HPA axis function . 2 . Subjects liver function test great two time normal , compromise liver function interfere HPA axis activity . 3 . Subjects Addison 's disease , Cushing 's disease diseases adrenal cortex likely affect HPA axis function . 4 . Subjects history current psychotic disorder bipolar affective disorder may interfere HPA function . 5 . Subjects current major depressive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder disorder associate characteristic change HPA axis function . 6 . Subjects receive synthetic glucocorticoid therapy , exogenous steroid therapy , treatment agent , interfere HPA axis function within one month time test . 7 . Subjects take opiate , opiate antagonist , benzodiazepine . ( Subjects maintain SSRI 's , anticonvulsant , antipsychotic ( sleep ) 8 week longer NOT exclude ) . 8 . Subjects acute illness fever may affect HPA axis activity . Individuals otherwise meet study criterion reschedule evaluation participation . 9 . Subjects &gt; 30 % ideal weight BMI great 30 consider study participation base clinical judgment study staff . 10 . Subjects unwilling maintain abstinence alcohol drug abuse ( except nicotine ) two day prior stress task procedure . 11 . Persons ferrous metal implant pacemaker since fMRI use . 12 . Subjects claustrophobic</criteria>
