	<brief_summary>Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction ( PTTD ) problem tendon connect one low leg muscle foot bone . PTTD cause pain , swell , flattened foot may require surgery left untreated . Normal treatment PTTD include physical therapy exercise . In treat similar condition low leg , exercise active , like strengthen , seem good result exercise passive , like stretch . This study determine whether add strengthen exercise normal PTTD treatment include wear brace stretch beneficial wear brace stretching .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction ( PTTD ) involve inflammation , overstretch , posterial tibial tendon , connect tibialis posterior muscle bone foot . PTTD cause pain inner ankle development flat foot . Without treatment , correction PTTD may require surgery . Standard intervention may prevent need surgery include orthotic device , bracing , physical therapy , among possibility . Within physical therapy , foot exercise either active—as case strengthen exercises—or passive—as case stretch exercise . Evidence clinical treatment similar condition suggest active exercise effective passive exercise lead recovery . This study determine whether add strengthen exercise normal intervention brace stretch effective improving range symptom stage II PTTD patient use brace stretch exercise . Participants Stage II PTTD recruit place one two group duration 12-week study . The first group undergo regular bracing perform stretch exercise . The second group undergo regular brace perform stretch strengthen exercise . Braces , worn weight-bearing task throughout study , include ankle stirrup support medial longitudinal arch support . Strengthening exercise , precede warm-up posterior tibialis muscle , include bilateral heel raise , foot adduction rear foot inversion thera-tubing , unilateral heel raise . Frequency exercise number repetition increase course study participant perform 3 set 30 repetition 2 time per day . Assessments , occur study entry , 6 week , 12 week , include foot range motion , length posterior tibial muscle , self-assessments function .</detailed_description>
