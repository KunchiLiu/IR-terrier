	<brief_title>Phase II Neoadjuvant Inflammatory Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Lapatinib design prevent slow growth cancer cell block protein inside cancer cell , call Her2/neu receptor epidermal growth factor ( EGFR ) . Cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel , 5-fluorouracil design block cancer cell divide , may slow stop growth ability spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Epirubicin design attach DNA ( genetic material cell ) may slow stop growth cause die . Study Drug Administration : On Weeks 1-24 take lapatinib every day mouth water ( 8 ounce ) . It take least 1 hour least 2 hour eat . It important take study drug time every day . You eat pamelo fruit , grapefruit , star fruit , pawpaw , and/or drink juice study . If forget take dose study drug , take miss dose soon remember , unless 12 hour . If 12 hour , take miss dose . Instead , take next dose schedule next day . If vomit take study drug , wait next day take next dose . The study drug store room temperature direct sunlight . The study drug keep away child . About every 3 week , need bring back empty partially use bottle study drug instruct doctor . On Weeks 3-12 , receive paclitaxel needle vein 1 time week . The infusion take 1 hour . You continue take lapatinib every day . On Weeks 13-24 , receive 5-fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide 1 time every 21 day study cycle . You receive 4 cycle . Each 5-fluorouracil infusion take 3-5 minute , epirubicin infusion take 5-10 minute , cyclophosphamide infusion take 45-60 minute . You continue take lapatinib every day Weeks 13-24 . If experience intolerable side effect , study doctor may give drug help side effect change dose study drug . Study Visits : On Day 1 Week 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask drug may take . - You performance status evaluation . Every 3 week take combination chemotherapy study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask change health drug may take . - You performance status evaluation . - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At Week 6 , CT scan , MRI , and/or bone scan check status disease . At end chemotherapy treatment , disease measure physical exam , chest CT scan sonogram check status disease . If disease gotten bad , take study . If disease gotten bad , take study . Your doctor discus next step treatment option . Surgery : At end chemotherapy period , disease respond well drug , surgery remove breast tumor . You sign separate consent form surgery . Either end-of-treatment visit week 24 do chemotherapy , surgery , follow test perform : - You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You performance status evaluation . - You ask drug may take . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test - You ECG . - You multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) echocardiogram check heart health . - You CT scan , MRI , and/or bone scan check status disease . - You tissue biopsy check status disease . Length Study : You may continue receive study drug 24 week . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Long-Term Follow-Up : Once study , follow-up visit 3 6 month surgery . At visit , MUGA ECHO perform . You additional visit every 4 month Years 2 3 , every 6 month Years 4 5 . At visit , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Lapatinib FDA approve commercially available take combination capecitabine another type breast cancer . Using Lapatinib inflammatory breast cancer investigational . 5-fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treat breast cancer . The combination drug currently FDA approve treatment IBC . At time , drug combination use research . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
