	<brief_summary>The goal pilot study identify marker panel marker blood urine wide range Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) patient segregate measure clinical severity . From identification candidate biomarkers , hop investigation , longitudinal natural history clinical efficacy study , verify biomarker sensitivity specificity allow eventual use validate pharmacodynamic marker surrogate endpoint . In addition , effort may elucidate biological pathway may potential therapeutic target .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Biomarkers Spinal Muscular Atrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) one two common inherit child 's neuromuscular disorder . There currently cure therapeutic approve slow progression disease . SMA characterize loss alpha motor neuron spinal cord , severe atrophy proximal muscle progressive debility disability due respiratory , gastrointestinal functional complication disease . Although SMA relatively common orphan disease , recruitment patient number candidate therapy expect become rate-limiting development therapeutic . STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary : - To identify candidate blood urine biochemical marker correlate disease severity determine Modified Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale across range type I , type II type III child Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) ( 1 ) . Secondary : - To determine biomarkers type I-III SMA patient correlate SMA type , age disease onset , 10-meter Timed Walk Test ( ambulatory subject ) , pulmonary function , nutritional assessment , SMN protein level , SMN transcript level SMN2 copy number . - To determine identified candidate biomarkers associate disease state comparison SMA specimens control volunteer specimen . - To determine potential biochemical pathway may represent target therapeutic intervention SMA .</detailed_description>
