	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety TAC-101 Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization ( TACE ) patient advance , unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) schedule TACE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study TAC-101 Combination With TACE Versus TACE Alone Asian Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) commonly perform procedure treatment unresectable liver tumor select patient . TACE major palliative treatment patient . Most patient intrahepatic recurrence tumor follow TACE . In study , conduct Asian country exclude Japan , TAC-101 administer maintenance therapy TACE compare placebo therapy TACE patient advance HCC schedule TACE either previous TACE procedure receive recent TACE least 120 day sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) TACE procedure result complete necrosis , determine TAC-101 enhance benefit TACE .</detailed_description>
