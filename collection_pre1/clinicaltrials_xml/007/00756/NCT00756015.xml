	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand influence post-operative rehabilitation rate tendon heal clinical outcome follow arthroscopic repair rotator cuff . There two school think type therapy program beneficial follow surgical cuff repair . However little data available compare . Therefore , investigator would like compare two standard plan care investigator may better define safety efficacy early mobilization shoulder versus keep shoulder immobilize follow surgical management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-op Rehabilitation 's Influence Tendon Healing &amp; Clinical Outcomes Following Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rotator cuff disease lead cause shoulder pain disability . Previous study regard epidemiology rotator cuff disease demonstrate high incidence age- related cuff tear , approximately 50 % individual age 55 year 1-3 . Failure conservative treatment often lead surgical repair torn rotator cuff tendon . Indeed , rotator cuff repair one common surgical procedure currently perform shoulder approximately 200,000 Americans undergoing surgery yearly . We estimate Shoulder Elbow Service Washington University perform approximately 400 rotator cuff repair per year . One primary concern follow repair rotator cuff healing repair tendon . Although pain relief improve shoulder function predictable follow rotator cuff repair , rate heal tendon repair much less consistent . In instance , repair tissue degenerative , 4 , 5 posse poor blood supply 6 , therefore , limited ability heal follow repair . The rate heal repair cuff tendon range 6 % 80 % across multiple study depend variety patient , tendon tear surgery related factor 7-13 . The major factor identify effect heal rotator cuff repair include patient age , size tear strength repair construct 8 , 9 , 12 . To point , little data regard potential influence postoperative rehabilitation shoulder structural integrity rotator cuff repair . The Shoulder Elbow Service Washington University extensive experience study various factor related progression rotator cuff disease , also tendon heal outcome treatment 8 , 14-16 . A strength research team collaborative experience develop musculoskeletal radiologist Mallinkrodt Institute use high-resolution ultrasound examine integrity rotator cuff . Extensive data ultrasound institution validate highly accurate mean identify quantify rotator cuff tear preoperative postoperative setting 17-20 . High-resolution ultrasound , hand experience musculoskeletal radiologist , proven accurate magnetic resonance image assess integrity rotator cuff postoperative set 19 . With modality , able study outcome tendon heal rate follow repair rotator cuff use conventional arthroscopic repair technique 8 . Recent data , institution , also complete examine clinical outcome repair integrity follow new arthroscopic technique ( double-row rotator cuff repair ) three separate patient population : partial thickness cuff tear , full thickness cuff tear revision recurrent rotator cuff tear ( manuscript progress ) . Our service also currently involve NIH R01 fund study prospectively examine factor related progression asymptomatic rotator cuff tear time . Given research experience ultrasound , Shoulder Elbow Service Washington University uniquely position study one important issue shoulder surgery - effect rehabilitation heal rotator cuff follow surgical repair . In addition tendon healing , one primary goal follow shoulder surgery early restoration range motion joint . Stiffness one common complication follow shoulder surgery . Early range motion help prevent formation adhesion within joint surround capsule ligament . Although cuff repair construct provide sufficient stability early range motion , effect motion repair site subsequent effect heal unknown human . Concerns regard deleterious effect early motion tendon heal lead investigator advocate substantially conservative rehab surgery . A delay motion shoulder may theoretically improve rate tendon heal stress minimize across tendon repair site . This may particularly important give tendon repair construct gradually become weak mature heal response occurs . However , delay motion slow return mobility shoulder may increase risk prolonged stiffness . Therefore , clinician must balance potential benefit ( prevention stiffness ) potential harm ( compromise surgical repair ) early rehabilitation follow rotator cuff repair surgery . Despite critical role early motion may , publish study examine influence postoperative rehabilitation clinical outcome repair integrity follow rotator cuff repair . The primary purpose study examine influence postoperative rehabilitation rate tendon heal clinical outcome follow arthroscopic repair rotator cuff . The ideal rehabilitation protocol follow rotator cuff repair yet determine . The clinical impact study significant good define safety efficacy early mobilization shoulder follow surgical management rotator cuff tear . A good understanding appropriate postoperative physical therapy regimens fundamental effective care patient follow rotator cuff repair . This study serve basis research define nonsurgical factor influence tendon healing outcome rotator cuff repair . Specific Aim 1 : To prospectively compare rate tendon heal follow arthroscopic repair small medium size tear rotator cuff patient treat two distinct postoperative rehabilitation protocol : immobilization versus early range motion . Hypothesis 1 : The rate tendon heal follow repair small medium size rotator cuff tear patient treated immobilization compare early range motion protocol . Specific Aim 2 : To prospectively compare clinical outcome follow arthroscopic repair small medium size tear rotator cuff patient treat two distinct postoperative rehabilitation protocol : immobilization versus early range motion . Hypothesis 2 : The clinical result follow repair small medium size rotator cuff tear substantially good patient treat early range motion protocol compare immobilize . A preliminary power analysis perform determine necessary number patient group ( alpha level =.05 beta level = .20 ) . Data institution suggest 80 % heal rate within age group small medium size rotator cuff tear fix double-row cuff repair technique . Given presume heal rate 80 % immobilization group , number necessary detect difference heal 20 % two rehabilitation protocol 70 subject group . Assuming conservative attrition rate 20 % , estimate total 170 subject need enrol study . All rotator cuff repair perform standard technique utilize arthroscopic double-row suture anchor construct . The surgery also include subacromial decompression acromioplasty dictate acromial degenerative change . Concomitant procedure related biceps tendon perform indicated . At time preoperative surgical evaluation , patient randomize seal envelope one two postoperative rehabilitation group : Immobilization group : 6 week sling shoulder immobilization . Immediate range motion elbow , forearm , wrist hand . At 6 week , PROM stretch shoulder allow therapist direction . At 12 week , AAROM AROM exercise initiated capsular stretching advance full ROM achieve . Strengthening activity rotator cuff , deltoid scapular stabilizer permit 4 month post surgery . Early range motion group : Shoulder pendulum exercise allow time surgery . Immediate range motion elbow , forearm , wrist hand . At first postoperative visit , PROM shoulder permit therapist direction . Patients avoid IR behind back stretching . At 6 week , AAROM AROM advance tolerate . Capsular stretch advanced full range motion achieve . Strengthening activity rotator cuff , deltoid scapular stabilizer permit 3 month post surgery .</detailed_description>
