	<brief_title>A Trial Everolimus Bevacizumab Children With Recurrent Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This traditional phase I dose find study estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) describe dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) combination bevacizumab , administer every 2 week IV everolimus administer orally daily child recurrent refractory solid tumor include CNS malignancy . Patients receive bevacizumab every two week IV , everolimus orally daily . Four consecutive week constitute one course subsequent course immediately follow break administration either drug . In absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity , treatment continue 2 year . The bevacizumab dose start 10 mg/kg . Everolimus start 4 mg/m2 , 80 % MTD establish current phase I trial . A traditional 3+3 dose escalation/de-escalation design use determine joint MTD two agent . Doses study detailed table . Consistent traditional design , enroll cohort 3 patient dose level start dose level 1 escalate next high dose , none 3 experience DLT . If one 3 patient experience DLT dose level 3 patient study level . If none 3 experience DLT escalation next level occur . Otherwise current dose consider toxic de-escalation occur . Under set , MTD dose level 0/3 1/6 patient would experience DLT next dose level determine toxic . Exploratory objective : 1 . To preliminarily define antitumor activity combination everolimus bevacizumab within confines phase I study 2 . To assess incidence PTEN PI3Kinase pathway activation recurrent refractory solid tumor childhood 3 . To assess everolimus pharmacokinetics child , include effect concomitant drug therapy ( e.g. , dexamethasone ) . 4 . To explore change correlative magnetic resonance image child receive everolimus bevacizumab 5 . To identify additional gene within outside mTOR pathway may act determinant response everolimus 6 . To explore pharmacogenetic polymorphism responsible everolimus disposition ( e.g. , metabolism elimination ) 7 . To test ability everolimus inhibit mTOR pathway signal patient recurrent solid tumor include CNS malignancy peripheral blood mononuclear cell 8 . To estimate blood level VEGF , BFGF , TSP-1 , I-CAM , v-CAM circulate endothelial cell prior , therapy therapy</detailed_description>

Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . Neurologic deficit . Patients CNS tumor must stable neurological deficit minimum 1 week prior study entry . Life Expectancy : Must great 8 week . Prior/Concurrent Therapy : Research participant must recover acute effect prior treatment : Chemotherapy : Must receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 week prior study entry ( 6 week prior nitrosurea , ) . Stem Cell Transplant Rescue : No evidence active graft vs. host disease great equal 2 month must elapse . Steroids : Dose stable decrease least one week prior start therapy . Corticosteroid therapy permissible treatment increase intracranial pressure patient malignancy CNS spinal cord compression . Corticosteroid use low dose control symptom discontinue possible . Must receive tacrolimus cyclosporine Biologic ( antineoplastic ) agent : At least 7 day since completion therapy biologic agent .

Pulmonary : No evidence dyspnea rest , exercise intolerance , pulse oximetry &gt; 94 % room air , clinical indication determination Central Nervous System : Patients without seizure disorder OR patient wellcontrolled seizure disorder receive anticonvulsant may enrol protocol . Anticonvulsants must enzymeinducing ( i.e. , barbiturate , phenytoin , carbamazepine , etc , please see Appendix II list drug inducer inhibitor CYP3A ) Informed consent explain signed parent/legal guardian patient patient ≥ 18 year .

Females childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior study entry . The effect everolimus develop human fetus unknown . However , bevacizumab know teratogenic detrimental fetal development animal model . In addition , bevacizumab may alter corpus luteum development endometrial proliferation , thereby negative effect fertility . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately remove study . Breastfeeding .
