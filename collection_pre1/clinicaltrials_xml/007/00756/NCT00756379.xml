	<brief_summary>The Century Trial single center Phase III randomize study sponsor Albert Weatherhead III Foundation conduct Dr. K. Lance Gould . The study hypothesis combine image-treatment regimen PET + comprehensive program lifestyle modification lipid lower drug target lipid level result improve cardiovascular risk score compare current standard optimal medical therapy , potentially result low rate death , non-fatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) revascularization procedure long term follow-up compare current standard care . If hypothesis correct , improve ability prevent treat CAD also illustrate , even expense behavioral intervention image technique , cost effective . This information may help patient risk know CAD obtain insurance coverage prevent disease well provide effective way treating .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Century Trial , Randomized Lifestyle Modification Study Management Stable Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances diagnostic image expensive technology reimbursement policy favor illness intervention rather primary secondary prevention result rise cost health care people deprive benefit ( Sultz 2004 , Bodenheimer 2002 ) . In field coronary artery disease ( CAD ) several non-invasive image technique diagnostic risk stratification purpose echocardiography , perfusion imaging ( cardiac stress SPECT - single photon emission compute tomography - stress PET - positron emission tomography ) , non-invasive cardiac compute tomography angiography ( CTA ) combine perfusion-anatomy ( PET-CT ) study . There estimate 40 million noninvasive cardiac test perform year ( Mark DB 2003 ) . For echocardiography SPECT imaging , reimbursement Medicare encompass approximately 30 % payment , total $ 1 billion year 2000 ( ACC 2003 ) . There , however , basic question cardiovascular image technique need address : technology benefit patient ? It worth cost ? Is treatment plan enhance ? Is outcome well ? Data necessary addressing question appropriate acceptance among practice physician , patient third party insurer . The relevance propose study , CENTURY trial , lie original design , test impact stress perfusion image PET couple two different intensity clinical management strategy ( standard comprehensive respectively ) . This study examine post-test resource utilization reduction cardiovascular risk patient know disease high risk CAD . There total 1300 men woman enrol approximately 650 subject randomize one two treatment arm . Eligible patient must clinical indication stress perfusion test . Following confirmation eligibility provision sign informed consent , patient randomize one two possible treatment strategy . At time randomization patient assign `` PET guide + comprehensive '' versus `` standard medical treatment . '' Patients group baseline myocardial PET perfusion study quantify blood flow heart muscle , electrocardiogram , exercise treadmill stress test ass exercise tolerance ( fitness ) , thorough review quality diet complete blood work cover individual lipid profile . These test assessment repeat 2 year 5 year . In addition subject assign standard medical management arm manage current standard care provide primary refer physician ask come clinic study visit annually 5 year document medical lifestyle management . The PET scan result blind end study standard care management group . Subjects enrolled comprehensive medical management arm support team professional focus atherosclerotic risk factor modification involve recommend treatment target lipid level , blood pressure diabetes control , smoke cessation , low fat diet aerobic exercise program . This addition standard current medical therapy provide primary refer physician . No experimental medication procedure use . Clinic visit subject 's education consulting comprehensive program perform five time first year semiannually thereafter .</detailed_description>
