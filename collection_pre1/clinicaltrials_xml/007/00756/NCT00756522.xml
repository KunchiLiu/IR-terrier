	<brief_title>Analyzing Lung Tissue People With Without Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Who Are Undergoing Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD common lung disease fourth common cause death United States . Symptoms include cough , excess mucus production , shortness breath , wheeze . There cure COPD , disease worsens time . Treatment include stop smoking , take medication , receive supplemental oxygen , severe case , undergo lung transplantation . COPD usually result many year cigarette smoking , remain unknown exactly cigarette smoke cause disease . One reason people COPD experience shortness breath cough lung airways partly damage obstruct . In healthy people , oxygen breathe pass easily bloodstream bunch small air sac fill lung . In people COPD , air sac damage , make difficult oxygen pas bloodstream . However , even people severe COPD , air sacs area lung continue work , even though neighbor air sac damage . It possible overactive immune response may cause air sac damage people COPD prone others immune system abnormality . By examine difference lung tissue people without COPD undergo lung transplant , study investigate people 's immune system cause lung damage others air sacs damage nearby air sac . Study researcher also examine whether genetic factor play role development severity COPD . This study enroll people COPD undergo lung transplantation . Before lung transplantation surgery , participant attend one study visit , include medical history review , height weight measurement , blood collection . A portion blood store future genetic research . Participants also complete questionnaire collect information activity , health , quality life . Some participant undergo 3-Helium magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedure , image technique allow doctor see air space inside lung . After lung transplantation surgery , study researcher collect lung tissue surgery . Study researcher contact participant end study collect follow-up medical information .</detailed_description>
