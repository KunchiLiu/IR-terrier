	<brief_title>The VA Diabetes Trial Follow-up Study ( VADT-FS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus major health problem U.S. , especially VA population . The majority diabetic Type 2 , risk microvascular ( e.g . eye , kidney ) macrovascular ( e.g . cardiovascular ) complication . It probable many macrovascular microvascular complication potentially prevent 5-7 year good Glycemic control achieve VADT ( median follow-up 6.25 year ) occur year completion VADT experimental protocol . This follow-up study provide opportunity see hold true 9 year follow end 465 . The result help VA evaluate appropriate treatment cost treatment . This longitudinal observational follow-up study CSP # 465 , `` Glycemic Control Complications Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 '' , VA Diabetes Trial ( VADT ) . The objective : 1 ) determine long term effect intensive glycemic control type 2 diabetes major cardiovascular complication ( primary outcome ) , 2 ) determine long term effect intensive glycemic control type 2 diabetes four secondary outcome : ) cardiovascular mortality , b ) major microvascular complication , c ) health-related quality life , ) total mortality . All patient active end VADT approach participation VADT-FS . The exclusion reason failure receive consent participation . Consented VADT-FS patient follow end study unless withdraw consent . Patients send short , standardized self-administered survey annually . Information collect include : 1 ) self-reported health status ; 2 ) occurrence study endpoint ; 3 ) VA non-VA outpatient visit , hospitalization procedure . A variety data source search verify endpoint . These source include : 1 ) VA non-VA medical record ; 2 ) data Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) ; 3 ) VA US death record . Patients respond 3 mailed survey contact phone . If still unsuccessful , designated surrogate contact . Certain endpoint adjudicate committee utilized VADT . Endpoints adjudicate include : 1 ) cause death ; 2 ) reason amputation ; 3 ) cardiac-related non-VA hospitalization . Endpoints interest study include : 1 ) mortality ; 2 ) acute myocardial infarction require hospitalization ; 3 ) stroke ; 4 ) new onset congestive heart failure ; 5 ) coronary revascularization ; 6 ) amputation ; 7 ) peripheral revascularization ; 8 ) renal insufficiency ; 9 ) severe visual impairment ; 10 ) self-reported health status ( diabetes-related quality life ) .</detailed_description>
