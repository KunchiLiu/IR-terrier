	<brief_summary>Rationale : The standard treatment chronic plantar fasciitis corticosteroid injection . Corticosteroid injection give temporarily pain reduction , heal . Blood platelet initiate natural healing rate . GPS ® give eightfold concentrate platelet patient blood . Injection platelet tendon might induce heal rate . Objective : To compare efficacy autologous platelet concentrate injection corticosteroid injection patient suffer plantar fasciitis respect pain function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Plantar fasciitis common cause foot complaint United States , make 11 15 percent foot symptom require professional care among adult ( Pfeffer et al. , 1999 ; Cole et al. , 2005 ) . A 2004 publication find approximately 1 million patient visit per year office-based physician hospital outpatient department United States plantar fasciitis ( Riddle et al. , 2004 ) . This figure consider podiatric physician visit , include number would raise overall physician visit relate plantar fasciitis considerably . The incidence plantar fasciitis peak people age 40 60 year bias towards either sex ( Taunton et al. , 2002 ) The underlying condition cause plantar fasciitis degenerative tissue condition occur near site origin plantar fascia medial tuberosity calcaneous ( Buchbinder , 2004 ) . In acute case , plantar fasciitis characterize classical sign inflammation include pain , swell loss function . For chronic condition , however , inflammation underlie tissue disruption . In fact , histology chronic case show sign inflammatory cell invasion affect area ( Lemont et al. , 2003 ) . The tissue instead characterize histological infiltration macrophage , lymphocyte , plasma cell ; tissue destruction ; repair involve immature vascularization fibrosis ( Lemont et al. , 2003 ) . The normal fascia tissue replace angiofibroblastic hyperplastic tissue insuitates throughout surround tissue create self-perpetuating cycle degeneration ( Lemont et al. , 2003 ) . In chronic case , suffix 'itis ' misnomer plantar fasciosis apt description underlie histology . Conservative treatment include stretch protocols foot orthoses resolve many case plantar fasciitis , report patient orthopedic practice around 80 percent resolution ( Cole et al. , 2005 ; Wolgin et al. , 1994 ; Martin et al. , 1998 ; Davies et al. , 1999 ) . For chronic case , number non-surgical intervention utilized include extracorperal shock wave therapy corticosteroid injection ( Cole et al. , 2005 ; Speed et al. , 2003 ; Acevedo , Beskin , 1998 ) . The use corticosteroid particularly trouble several study link plantar fascial rupture repeat local injection corticosteroid ( Cole et al. , 2005 ; Sellman , 1994 ; Leach et al. , 1978 ; Acevedo , Beskin , 1998 ) . All method limit efficacy case chronic plantar fasciitis due fact none adequately address full scope underlie tissue degeneration . This frequently leave surgical intervention viable option chronic case . The goal treatment chronic plantar fasciitis cease ultimately reverse degenerate tissue disruption root condition . The three step critical full repair effect tissue : 1 . Enhancing influx proliferation fibroblast effect area . This allow tissue bed extremely receptive vascularization 2 . Promote angiogenesis develop mature vascular structure effect area 3 . With mature vascularization , collagen deposition occur , result organization fully mature tendon tissue The injection platelet-rich-plasma ( PRP ) effect tissue address three heal stage necessary reverse degenerative process . The individual cytokine present platelet α-granules show enhance fibroblast migration proliferation , upregulate vascularization , increase collagen deposition variety vitro vivo setting [ Molloy 2004 ] . Autologous PRP contain concentrate white blood cell platelet suspend plasma . Since acidic anticoagulant ( Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose Solution A ) use allow processing whole blood via centrifugation , PRP must buffer increase pH normal physiologic level prior injection effect tissue . This accomplished addition 8.4 % sodium bicarbonate solution ratio 0.05cc sodium bicarbonate solution 1cc platelet concentrate . The result buffered platelet concentrate contain approximately 6 8 time concentration platelet compare baseline whole blood . The cytokine present platelet α-granules show affect three heal stage necessary reverse chronic plantar fasciitis condition ( Molloy et al. , 2003 ) . Additionally , many cytokine see work dose dependent manner ( Molloy et al. , 2003 ) . A PRP injection effect area tissue would provide concentrated level cytokine result heal cascade halt ultimately reverse underlie pathology elbow tendinosis . This treatment concept directly address exist condition prove superior alternative current conservative treatment chronic plantar fasciitis . The objective clinical investigation compare efficacy autologous platelet concentrate injection corticosteroid injection patient suffer plantar fasciitis respect pain function . Primary question Does injection autologous platelet concentrate result large percentage successfully treat patient 6 month injection corticosteroid injection ? Secondary question Does injection autologous platelet concentrate large pain reduction injection corticosteroid injection ? ( VAS ) Does injection autologous platelet concentrate large improvement function corticosteroid injection ? ( AOFAS , WHOQol ) Does injection autologous platelet concentrate large amount satisfy patient corticosteroid injection ? ( WHOQol , satisfaction )</detailed_description>
