	<brief_summary>In secondary prevention , beneficial role cardiac rehabilitation program myocardial infarction , percutaneous coronary intervention coronary artery bypass well establish . The large majority patient n't benefit cardiac rehabilitation , usually follow inhospital short health educational program sensibilisation different coronary risk factor like smoking , overweight inactivity . The impact inhospital short health educational program combine cardiac rehabilitation never totally evaluated , especially impact smoke cessation , weight loss daily physical activity . Therefore , present study aim evaluate impact one year 400 consecutive patient ' coronary risk profile : - inhospital short health educational program alone - inhospital short health educational program combine cardiac rehabilitation - cardiac rehabilitation program alone</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Classical CV risk factor , quality life , daily physical activity energy expenditure , smoke dependency daily quantification fat intake assess previously validate self-administrated questionnaire . Further factor like lipid profile glycaemia ( HbA1c case diabetes ) also assess . These evaluation take place hospitalization acute coronary event patient , end three rehabilitation program concerned patient , finally , one year hospitalization end rehabilitation program ( mailed questionnaire biological check-up ) . At time , smoke dependency , medication , body mass index , coronary event need coronary revascularization along professional ongoing situation ( return work ) investigate . As study aim evaluate efficiency France 's clinical practice spot relevant risk factor , result present study could help u focus medical paramedical resource modification specific relevant risk factor .</detailed_description>
