	<detailed_description>Background significance : Switzerland approximately 8 % premature births one high premature rate Europe preterm neonate need neonatal intensive care . Recur-rent neonatal pain stress occur routinely neonatal intensive care , particularly among extremely low birth weight preterm neonate . It become clear recent year nervous system undergoes extensive development postnatally increase evidence repeat exposure pain , may lead serious biobehavioral change sensitive developmental phase central nervous system change may underlie long-term learn behavior difficulty patient population . The frequency exposure pain adequate treatment pain therefore important factor later motor cognitive development preterm infant require intensive care . Pain treatment infant view inadequate context acute diagnostic therapeutic procedure NICU . Up 80 % analgesic use neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) either `` label use '' `` non-licensed used '' . Secondary significant side effect , associate use analgesic drug , health care provider often reticence administer drug NICU . As alternative approach non-pharmacological intervention pain prevention relief increasingly recommended prevention treatment mild moderate pain population . This type intervention include method involve reduce sensitivity neonate painful procedure , show effectively reduce pain minor procedure neonate . Although non-pharmacological intervention show efficacious test single painful procedure lack evidence relate efficacy infant expose high number painful procedure accompany chronic stress . To improve clinical outcome critical need accurate efficient neonatal pain management highly vulnerable patient population . Specific aim : To determine sample size need large randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) design compare sustain impact three non-pharmacological approach pain reactivity premature neo-nates NICU . Design method : This multicenter pilot study use randomize three group , repeat measure design . 72 premature infant 24 0/7 32 0/7 week gestation need neonatal intensive care recruit first 2 day life three University Clinics ( Bern , Basel , Zurich ) . The premature infant randomly assign one three intervention group ( 1 ) oral sucrose , ( 2 ) facilitate tucking , ( 3 ) oral sucrose plus facilitated tucking . Sucrose currently standard care NICUs Switzerland serve usual care control condition . The infant stratify two gestational group examine impact gestational age effect size estimate . Five heel stick across 12-14 day videotape pain rat 4 independent raters , blind data collection period . Raters use `` Bernese Pain Scale Neonates '' measure pain , heel stick procedure . The physiologic data ( heart rate oxygen saturation ) need complete Bernese Pain Scale Neonates load clinical database time frame neonate videotape . Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) perform painful procedure one site measure differences somatosensory cortical activation heel stick infant manage three intervention baseline across repeat heel stick . Expected value propose project : Adequate efficient pain management important factor later motor cognitive development preterm infant require intensive care . This pilot data provide information sample size need large RCT . That study compare impact mention non-pharmacological intervention pain reactivity across multiple painful procedure . In addition examine individual impact , evaluate impact use combination . The large study contribute good understanding efficacy non-pharmacological pain relieve method efficacy across repeat pain exposure . This pilot study collaborative effort discipline nurse science neonatal medicine .</detailed_description>
