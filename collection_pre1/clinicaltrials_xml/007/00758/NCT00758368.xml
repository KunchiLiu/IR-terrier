	<detailed_description>Levodopa drug take mouth , improve symptom Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . However eventually cause involuntary movement call dyskinesia motor fluctuationsâ€”fluctuations control symptom , often refer `` '' `` . '' Apomorphine drug work well levodopa , work take mouth . The purpose study compare effect apomorphine people PD levodopa-induced motor fluctuation dyskinesias . In trial , researcher compare effect apomorphine administer subcutaneous bolus injection ( pulsatile ) ambulatory infusion pump ( continuous ) 24 people PD , 6 month . After initial screening , potential participant undergo test verify tolerate respond apomorphine . Those meet requirement randomize receive study drug via injection ( shot ) use injector pen portable infusion pump . Apomorphine give either continuously use portable pump wake day intermittently injection , 6 month . The pump carry belt connect tube small needle skin . Injections apomorphine skin self-administered participant administer friend family member use injector pen . After 6 month , effect apomorphine use assess measure participant respond levodopa measure symptom course study .
