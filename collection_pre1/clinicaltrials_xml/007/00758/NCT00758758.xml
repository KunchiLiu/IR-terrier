	<detailed_description>The objective clinical investigation compare patient treat Anterior Cervical Discectomy Fusion ( ACDF ) use Hedrocel Cervical Fusion Device , concurrent , randomize , control group receive autologous iliac crest bone graft . Success criterion include radiographic evidence fusion , improvement pain , function overall quality life . If show successful , use Hedrocel Cervical Fusion Device would eliminate complication associate harvest autologous bone graft provide alternative unable provide autologous bone graft iliac crest .</detailed_description>
