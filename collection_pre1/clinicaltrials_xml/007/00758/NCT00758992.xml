	<brief_summary>These study design evaluate relative efficiency gene transfer primitive human hematopoietic cell compare lentiviral foamy virus vector vehicle transfer expression globin gene . Normal volunteer serve research participant . Each receive 4 day course Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) peripheral blood apheresis perform recover mononuclear cell population enrich primitive hematopoietic cell . The stem progenitor cell purify selection base expression CD34 antigen . The CD34+ population culture vitro various cytokine transduce vector particle . The efficiency gene transfer evaluate transduced CD34+ population , progenitor contain within population culture semisolid medium cell capable establish human hematopoiesis immunodeficient mouse . The level transgene expression evaluate mature hematopoietic lineage develop vitro immunodeficient mouse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peripheral Blood Stem Cells Obtained From Normal Volunteers Studying Retroviral Vector Mediated Gene Transfer Into Primitive Hematopoietic Cells Vector Mediated Transgene Expression Mature Hematopoietic Lineages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The peripheral blood establish source hematopoietic stem cell , provide alternative source bone marrow hematopoietic reconstitution patient oncologic , hematologic , genetic disease . Although apheresis less efficient bone marrow harvest collection large number CD34+ ( marker early hematopoietic precursor ) cell , apheresis less traumatic , require anesthesia perform frequently bone marrow harvest . The purpose preclinical research project investigate use hematopoietic stem cell mobilize peripheral blood target retroviral-mediated gene therapy , compare efficiency transduction primitive cell lentiviral foamy viral vector system evaluate ability expand stem cell ex vivo use hematopoietic growth factor ( cytokine ) . Research participant study healthy adult volunteer . The growth factor , Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) , give 4 day prior apheresis mobilize increase number primitive hematopoietic cell bone marrow circulation . Nucleated blood cell collect apheresis CD34+-enriched cell population isolate use antibody-based technique . Administration G-CSF essential allow collection sufficient number primitive stem progenitor cell normal volunteer . In dose use study , 15-35 fold increase concentration CD34+ cell occur peripheral blood 4 day G-CSF administration result apheresis product contains , average , 1-2 x1010 nucleated cell 1-2x108 purified CD34+cells recover . This number sufficient allow experimental design include vitro culture , transduction vector particle assay transduced cell immunodeficient mouse model . The use G-CSF mobilization stem progenitor cell widely use clinical technique autologous allogeneic transplantation prove safe effective . Bone muscle pain , headache fatigue common complication typically manage acetaminophen rarely require discontinuation G-CSF . Transient elevation alkaline phosphatase LDH common . Follow-up study show prolonged , mild neutropenia , lymphopenia thrombocytopenia follow G-CSF administration apheresis . Splenic enlargement show non-invasive measurement four case splenic rupture normal individual describe . A reduction arterial pO2 associate decrease O2 saturation 98 96 % report . Transient thrombophilia infer base change blood coagulation parameter . Other rare complication report include development inflammatory infectious lesion . A fatal crisis occur sibling donor allogeneic transplantation hemoglobin SC disease . These rare complication put context G-CSF administration follow apheresis recover primitive hematopoietic cell normal individual utilized major transplant center decade generally safe without significant complication . We propose minimize risk serious complication limit age range research participants 18-40 year exclude history inflammatory disease , cardiovascular disease , thrombosis pulmonary embolization , inflammatory skin disorder , hematological disease hemoglobinopathy . The ability expand mobilize CD34+ cell vitro use various cytokine combination culture condition examine use flow cytometry , vitro colony assay quantitating concentration cell able establish hematopoiesis immunodeficient mouse . Both unexpanded expand CD34+ cell use experiment design investigate suitability target retroviral-mediated gene transfer . Gene transfer efficiency functional expression transfer sequence assess differentiated progeny CD34+ cell . We plan compare lentiviral foamy virus vector system respect relative efficiency gene transfer primitive human hematopoietic cell . Various substance e.g. , Fibroblast Growth Factor -1 Wnt 3A , report cause expansion primitive murine hematopoietic cell also evaluate effect primitive human hematopoietic cell culture . Another focus comparison various globin gene vector respect relative level globin gene expression differentiate erythroid cell . Finally , impact cryopreservation viability engraftment potential primitive hematopoietic cell assess . This research proposal provide preclinical data aid development treatment strategy genetic disease , specifically hemoglobin disorder , base gene transfer repopulating stem cell .</detailed_description>
