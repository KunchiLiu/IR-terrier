	<brief_summary>This prospective study assess efficacy trastuzumab therapy pretreated NSCLC patient . Patients locally advance metastatic NSCLC , HER2 FISH positive and/or HER2 gene mutation , pretreated least one previous chemotherapy line consider eligible trial . After evaluation inclusion exclusion criterion , signature inform consensus form , eligible patient receive trastuzumab 6 mg/kg every 3 week ( 8 mg/kg load dose ) disease progression , unacceptable toxicity patient refusal .</brief_summary>
