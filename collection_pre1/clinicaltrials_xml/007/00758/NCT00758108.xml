	<brief_summary>This study explore condition cause absence certain gene chromosome 11 . These condition include WAGR syndrome , characterize kidney tumor call Wilm tumor , aniridia ( absence iris eye ) , genital urinary abnormality , mental retardation , possibly symptom . This study examine gene chromosome 11 affect people whether absence specific gene associate specific symptom . Healthy normal volunteer , people isolate aniridia , people WAGR another chromosome 11 gene deletion may eligible study . Participants must least 6 year old . Parents patient may also participate genetic study . Participants undergo follow procedure , depend whether child , adult , healthy volunteer parent patient : - Medical history physical examination , eye examination , blood , urine saliva test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) electroencephalogram ( EEG ) - X-rays , scans test measure body composition ( fat , muscle bone development thickness ) MRI examine eye brain measure abdominal fat - Ultrasound study kidneys , ovary uterus ( female ) testis ( male ) - Meal test , food diary food preference test - Questionnaires eat sleep habit , personality character traits response pain injury - Neuropsychological test - Tests rest metabolic rate , energy expenditure glucose ( sugar ) tolerance - Hot cold sensitivity test , vibration sensitivity test , cold tolerance test smell identification test - Eye hearing test - Nerve conduction study study sensory information conduction peripheral nerve spinal cord brain - Computer photography - Evaluation sub-specialists ( e.g. , endocrinologist , ophthalmologist , physiatrist , neurologist others ) indicate patient medical history test result</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>WAGR syndrome rare genetic disorder characterize Wilms tumor , aniridia , genitourinary anomaly mental retardation . The syndrome cause heterozygous contiguous gene deletion variable size chromosome 11 , involve region encompass 100 gene , many unknown function human . In preliminary study , observe approximately two-thirds patient WAGR syndrome deletion gene encode brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , BDNF haploinsufficiency associate obesity parent report hyperphagia impaired nociception , suggest BDNF may play important role human energy balance well pain sensation . We propose conduct comprehensive clinical phenotype-genotype study patient WAGR syndrome 11p deletion . We plan enroll 75 subject WAGR syndrome/11p deletion undergo evaluation follow system : metabolic/endocrine , sensation/nociception , ophthalmologic , audiologic , neurocognitive , renal/genitourinary , oncologic , dental/craniofacial , cardiac , orthopedic . Genetic testing perform parent subject WAGR syndrome/11p deletion choose participate order determine parental origin deletion influence phenotype . We also plan enroll 75 healthy subject body-size matched control metabolic study 75 patient isolated aniridia visually impaired control neurocognitive study . We hypothesize complete understanding correlation phenotype genotype could lead improve medical care patient genotype-specific management well yield insight physiological role gene 11p region .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : For WAGR/11p deletion subject : 1 . Diagnosis WAGR/11p deletion confirm prior genetic test clinical history consistent WAGR syndrome ( Wilms Tumor and/or genitourinary anomaly plus aniridia ) . Genetic diagnosis confirm NIH , do previously 2 . Age great equal 2 year old ( Subjects age 26y outpatient evaluation , one 60 mL ( 5 mL/kg weight &lt; 12 kg ) blood draw , eye examination , cognitive , behavioral , psychiatric assessment perform ; subject age 6y old participate full protocol ) 3 . Medically stable ( patient safely undergo plan test ) ; history Wilms tumor , must &gt; 6 month since completion chemotherapy must consider remission primary oncologist caring patient For parent WAGR/11p deletion subject : ) Biological parent child WAGR/11p deletion able give consent self participation For healthy control subject : 1 . Age great eqaul 2 year old ( Subjects age 26y outpatient evaluation , one 60 mL ( 5 mL/kg weight &lt; 12 kg ) blood draw , cognitive , behavioral , psychiatric assessment perform ; subject age 6y old participate full protocol ) 2 . No chronic medication . Use asneeded overthecounter medication review casebycase basis Principal Investigator 3 . No chronic medical psychiatric condition anticipate affect result impede study participation For aniridia subject : 1 . Diagnosis aniridia confirm ophthalmologist 2 . Age great eqaul 2 year old ( Subjects age 26y outpatient evaluation , one 60 mL ( 5 mL/kg weight &lt; 12 kg ) blood draw , eye examination , cognitive , behavioral , psychiatric assessment perform ; subject age 6y old participate full protocol ) 3 . Medically stable , chronic medical psychiatric condition anticipate affect result impede study participation EXCLUSION CRITERIA : For WAGR/11p deletion subject : 1 . Anorexiant use precede 6 month 2 . Greater 2 % body weight loss precede 6 month 3 . Pregnancy 4 . Individuals , whose parent guardian , current substance abuse psychiatric disorder condition , opinion investigator , would impede competence compliance possibly hinder completion study For parent WAGR/11p deletion subject : ) No exclusion lack ability give consent participation For healthy control subject : 1 . Anorexiant use precede 6 month 2 . Greater 2 % body weight loss precede 6 month 3 . Pregnancy 4 . Individuals , whose parent guardian , current substance abuse psychiatric disorder condition , opinion investigator , would impede competence compliance possibly hinder completion study For aniridia subject : 1 . Anorexiant use precede 6 month 2 . Greater 2 % body weight loss precede 6 month 3 . Pregnancy 4 . Individuals , whose parent guardian , current substance abuse psychiatric disorder condition , opinion investigator , would impede competence compliance possibly hinder completion study</criteria>
