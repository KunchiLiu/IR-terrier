	<brief_title>Using Rheological Methods Characterize Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) Sputum Effects Mucoactive Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two major mechanism mucus clearance airway , dependent upon optimal mucus viscosity elasticity . These mechanism severely impaired cystic fibrosis . The physical property sputum measure use rheological method , enable comparison mucus health disease . Therapies enhance mucus clearance airway decrease volume airway secretion collectively call `` mucoactive agent . '' Therapies specifically disrupt innate mucus architecture break intermolecular entanglement bond call mucolytic agent . Mucolytic drug consider three general category : classic mucolytics ( n-acetylcysteine ) , peptide mucolytics ( PulmozymeÂ® ) , non-destructive mucolytics ( hypertonic saline ) . Using state-of-the-art rheological method , characterize physical property CF mucus measure rheologic effect mucoactive drug accurately reproducibly previously do literature . In way , determine current mucoactive agent effective normalize sputum rheology CF , gain important insight limitation current mucoactive drug .</detailed_description>
