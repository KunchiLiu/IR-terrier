	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To obtain epidemiological information biological material population-based series prostate cancer case . - To identify novel cancer susceptibility gene comparison genotype frequency case correspond frequency large control series . - To estimate age sex-specific risk associate variant predisposition gene . - To evaluate interaction polymorphisms predisposition gene potential lifestyle risk factor . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients complete detailed epidemiological questionnaire , include information education , occupation , smoke habit , alcohol consumption , height , weight , family history cancer , past medical history . Blood sample collect patient . DNA extract blood sample sample collect cancer-free control participant MREC-SEARCH-CONTROL well additional control European Prospective Investigation Cancer ( EPIC ) study ( population base study diet health base Norfolk , East Anglia ) . DNA sample analyze polymorphisms low penetrance cancer susceptibility gene . In addition prostate cancer patient recruit study , patient breast , ovarian , endometrial , colorectal , bladder , kidney , pancreatic , brain esophageal cancer , malignant melanoma , lymphoma cancer recruit follow related clinical trial : MREC-SEARCH-BREAST , MREC-SEARCH-OVARIAN , MREC-SEARCH-ENDOMETRIAL , MREC-SEARCH-COLORECTAL , MREC-SEARCH-CANCER .</detailed_description>
