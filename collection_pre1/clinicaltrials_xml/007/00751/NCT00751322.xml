	<brief_summary>Specific aim : To test whether transfusion leukoreduced red cell lesser storage time ( versus conventional storage time ) reduce mild alteration pulmonary function immune activation critically ill patient mechanically ventilated lung . We propose perform prospective , randomize , double-blind clinical trial critically ill patient whose lung mechanically ventilate , order receive transfusion least one unit pack red cell , compare pulmonary function patient randomly allocate receive unit red cell store 5 day less , similar patient randomly allocate receive unit red cell store conventionally ( median 21 day ) . We test hypothesis transfusion red cell lesser storage age , ( 5 day less ) produce less change pulmonary function immune activation transfusion red cell conventional storage age ( median 21 day ) .</brief_summary>
