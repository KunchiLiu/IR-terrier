	<criteria>Provide write informed consent . Male female patient ≥ 18 year age . Histologically confirm diagnosis GIST anatomical location , unresectable and/ metastatic recurrent . Documented disease progression accord RECIST 1.0 . Documentation progression require either 2 CT scan 2 MRI scan within 6 month prior randomization ( one image document lesion document progression lesion ( ) growth presence new lesion ( ) ) . The interval 2 image great 6 month apart . Scans provide select image CRO . Documented disease progression must occur imatinib 400 mg PO q.d . Imatinib therapy could ( 1 ) unresectable GIST ; ( 2 ) metastatic GIST ; ( 3 ) recurrent GIST imatinib adjuvant therapy recurrent GIST post adjuvant imatinib therapy . Positive immunohistochemical stain cKIT ( CD117 ) negative stain KIT , either positive stain DOG1 identified mutation KIT PDGFR gene . Presence least one measurable lesion accord RECIST 1.0 , define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ( conventional CT MRI scan ) ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan . Lesions previously irradiate area consider measurable demonstrate clear evidence progression since radiotherapy . A performance status 0 , 1 2 accord Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale ( Oken et al 1982 ) ( Appendix A ) . Adequate organ function , indicate following : White blood cell ( WBC ) count ≥ 3500/mm3 ; Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500/mm3 ; Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL ; Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L ; Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN ( &lt; 3.0 X ULN related disease ) ; Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 time ULN , unless liver metastasis present , case AST ALT ≤ 5 time ULN ; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 time ULN ; Serum amylase lipase ≤1.5 X ULN ; Alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 X ULN ( ≤ 5.0 X ULN related disease ) ; Serum potassium , phosphorus , magnesium calcium ≥ LLN [ low limit normality ] correctable supplement prior first dose study drug . ( Total calcium correct serum albumin ) Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior registration . Fertile patient ( female ) must agree use acceptable method contraception avoid pregnancy duration study 3 month study termination . Prior use imatinib dose high 400 mg q.d . prior use tyrosinekinase inhibitor . Tumor progression stop imatinib 400 mg q.d . No investigational cytotoxic drug ≤ 4 week ( 6 week nitrosurea mitomycin C ) prior Screening Visit ( V100 ) allow exception imatinib therapy . Cytotoxic , antineoplastic treatment , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biological response modifier , radiotherapy . If measurable lesion previously irradiate show clear evidence progression since radiotherapy , patient include . Serious uncontrolled concomitant medical psychiatric illness . Impaired cardiac function include one following : LVEF &lt; 45 % institutional low limit normal range ( whichever high ) confirm ECHO Muga Inability determine QT interval ECG Complete leave bundle branch block Right bundle branch block plus leave anterior posterior hemiblock Use ventricularpaced pacemaker Congenital long QT syndrome know family history long QT syndrome History presence clinically significant ventricular atrial tachyarrhythmias Clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 bpm ) ; QTcF &gt; 450 msec screen ECG ( use QTcF formula ) . If QTc &gt; 450 electrolyte within normal range , electrolyte correct patient rescreened QTc ; History clinical sign myocardial infarction within 1 year study entry History unstable angina within 1 year study entry Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g. , congestive heart failureor uncontrolled hypertension ) . Treatment strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( e.g. , erythromycin , ketoconazole , itraconazole , voriconazole , clarithromycin , telithromycin , ritonavir , mibefradil ) treatment discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug . ( Appendix B ) . Treatment strong CYP3A4 inducer ( e.g. , dexamethasone , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampin , rifabutin , rifapentin , phenobarbitol , St John 's Wort ) , treatment discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug . Patients use medication document prolong QT interval ( see Appendix B complete list ) . Grade 3 high impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome ) . History acute pancreatitis within one year study entry medical history chronic pancreatitis . Patients history another primary malignancy currently clinically significant currently require active intervention . Patients clinically significant medical surgical condition , accord investigator ' discretion , preclude participation ; ( i.e . : severe renal disease unrelated tumor , active chronic liver disease hepatitis B C virus carrier normal liver function test , describe , include ) . This include patient acquire bleed disorder unrelated cancer . Use investigational agent within 28 day prior enrollment study foreseen use investigational agent study . History noncompliance medical regimen inability grant consent . Women pregnant , breast feeding , childbearing potential without negative serum pregnancy test baseline . Male female patient childbearing potential unwilling use effective barrier contraceptive throughout trial 3 month follow discontinuation study drug . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Inability comply study protocol . Patients history CNS metastasis . Note : Patients without clinical sign symptom CNS involvement require CT/MRI brain . Major surgery within 4 week prior randomization recover prior surgery Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply</criteria>
