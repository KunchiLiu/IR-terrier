	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess feasibility Ixabepilone ( 4 cycle ) administer every 14 day support G-CSF sequentially combination Fluorouracil , Epirubicin Cyclophosphamide ( 4 cycle ) administer every 14 day support G-CSF . To evaluate efficacy ( term pathologic Complete Responses breast axilla ) , dose reduction rate , median treatment delay discontinuation rate due toxicity regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Estrogen receptor negative breast cancer may define distinct biologic subtype disease , aggressive typical molecular portrait . [ 30 ] This subtype seem poor prognosis poor treatment option patient candidate hormonal therapy . Novel treatment strategy focus upon subtype necessary future . [ 31 ] There report clinical benefit estrogen receptor negative patient treat dose-dense chemotherapy ( see background CALGB 9741 MIG-1 study ) . In CALGB 9741 study , patient randomize receive dose-dense regimen experience severe toxicity paclitaxel treatment lead dose reduction 7 % 5 % respectively . Ixabepilone show consistent activity acceptable safety profile patient stag breast cancer . This phase II study evaluate feasibility dose-dense Ixabepilone ( 4 cycle ) give sequentially combination Fluorouracil , Epirubicin Cyclophosphamide ( 4 cycle ) give every 14 day support Filgrastim neo-adjuvant treatment ER-negative breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
