	<detailed_description>Treatment cholesterol-lowering medication , specifically statins , associate 73 % reduction prevalence AD , suggest potentially promising role statin prevention AD . In order well understand mechanism statin may possibly modify blood AD risk , study evaluate whether administration atorvastatin favorably alters blood flow brain ( measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ) blood vessel function ( measure ultrasound ) . Participants ask attend 3 visit course 4-month study . At initial visit , participant complete short questionnaire past medical history medication history . At baseline visit , participant randomize 1:1 ratio receive atorvastatin 40 mg nightly vs. match placebo . At baseline follow-up visit , participant provide update medical problem medication , review potential side effect , fast blood test collect safety monitoring , include liver muscle enzyme monitoring . In addition , participant MRI ultrasound measure collect .</detailed_description>
