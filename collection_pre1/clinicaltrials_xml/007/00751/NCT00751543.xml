	<brief_summary>Lung cancer one leading cause cancer-related death Taiwan . Recently , treatment method available result increase patient survival . Although adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma categorize non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , recent advancement target therapy imply two histology behave differently ( Shah NT , et al . 2005 ; Sandler A , et al . 2006 ) . Radiation therapy important method locally advance non-resectable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Computed tomography ( CT ) mainstay evaluate lung cancer . The advance multi-row detector CT ( MDCT ) provide volumetric acquisition within breath hold , enable detailed evaluation tissue organ perfusion excellent resolution . Using new technique image post processing , excellent spatial resolution functional perfusion information obtain simultaneously . Therefore , purpose study explore longitudinal change lung cancer eligible radiation therapy ( include concurrent , sequential chemoradiotherapy high-dose radiation therapy ) also comparison adenocarcinoma squamous cell lung cancer use perfusion MDCT . Total twenty patient histopathologically prove adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma enrol study receive longitudinal study perfusion MDCT evaluation , radiation therapy early late phase complete radiation therapy . Dynamic perfusion use processing image data , quantitative parameter tumor blood volume permeability etc derive . From study , expect understand change tumor vascularity radiation therapy character treatment response adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma addition change tumor size .</brief_summary>
