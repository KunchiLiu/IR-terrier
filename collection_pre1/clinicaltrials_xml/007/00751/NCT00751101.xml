	<brief_title>Nicotine Patches Reducing Hand-Foot Syndrome Patients Who Are Receiving Capecitabine For Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine feasibility use nicotine patch , term side effect number voluntary withdrawal study , patient metastatic breast cancer undergo chemotherapy capecitabine . Secondary - Determine efficacy nicotine patch preventive agent hand-foot syndrome ( HFS ) assess incidence HFS arm . - Determine grade HFS arm . - Determine percentage patient require reduction dose capecitabine due adverse event . - Determine percentage patient require pain medication HFS . - Determine percentage patient use symptomatic treatment HFS ( e.g. , moisturizers , ice , cool pack ) . - Evaluate effect nicotine patch quality-of-life patient undergoing capecitabine chemotherapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-7 15-21 . Treatment capecitabine repeat every 21 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm I : Patients apply transdermal nicotine patch every 24 hour begin 1 day prior initiation capecitabine continue end capecitabine therapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients apply transdermal nicotine patch every 24 hour begin day 1 course chemotherapy follow appearance hand-foot syndrome symptom . Treatment continue end capecitabine therapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , 3 12 week . Patients also complete daily diary document side effect medication compliance . After completion study therapy , patient follow 3 week .</detailed_description>
