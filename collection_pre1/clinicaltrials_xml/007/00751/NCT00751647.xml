	<detailed_description>Study Design : Phase II clinical trial . Objective : To determine whether customized physical therapy exercise intervention title Core Strengthening Respiratory Exercise Program ( CSREP ) clinically improve follow outcome measure child age 10 21 cystic fibrosis : pulmonary function , aerobic capacity , rib cage mobility , posture , core strength , thus warrant extensive study development . Background : Previous research conduct pediatric population focus effect aerobic training , anaerobic training , strengthen extremity health child cystic fibrosis . However , disease process cystic fibrosis secondarily cause impairment musculoskeletal nervous system . No intervention study aim positively impact system do date child cystic fibrosis . Methods : A 6-month CSREP customize meet specific need participant .

Participants give calendar track completion home exercise level compliance . During Part II , researcher call participant every week order encourage compliance home exercise program provide clarification need . All participant continue receive regular medical care well PT treatment . A respiratory therapist perform pulmonary function test , respiratory therapist along exercise physiologist perform VO2max testing , physical therapist perform physical therapy evaluation , include assessment rib cage mobility , core strength , posture . Another physical therapist well physical therapist assistant provide physical therapy treatment , instruct participant home program , make weekly phone call participant . An experience survey design evaluate satisfaction scale 1 10 self score outcome measure include : respiratory function , cough strength , activity tolerance , posture , strength three point Likert scale : 1 ) Got bad ; 2 ) Stayed ; 3 ) Got well . Additionally , survey include question likelihood continue home program study end . The survey administer 6 month upon completion program .
