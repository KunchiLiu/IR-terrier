	<brief_title>Study Lenalidomide Previously Untreated , Symptomatic Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , nonrandomized , single institution study symptomatic , previously untreated CLL patient . Subjects receive study drug , lenalidomide , start 2.5 mg daily x 3 week ( day 1-21 ) escalate target dose 10 mg daily X 3 week ( day 1-21 ) follow 1 week therapy ( day 22-28 ) 28 day cycle . Although maximal dose 10 mg daily ( day 1-21 ) target , patient felt investigator benefiting dose less target dose ( i.e . 2.5 mg 5 mg daily ) , investigator may discretion choose hold patient dose without escalation . For patient progressive disease cycle 3 , dose escalation assess response toxicity end escalate dose cycle maximum 25 mg ( day 1-21 ) allow . Patients treat lenalidomide disease progression 2 cycle past CR . ( maximum cycle ) .</detailed_description>
