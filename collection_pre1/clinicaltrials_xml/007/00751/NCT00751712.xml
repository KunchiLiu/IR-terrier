	<brief_summary>One know risk pediatric heart surgery possibility brain damage . This problem result lack oxygen rich blood flow brain surgery . In order provide patient 's brain blood operation , selective cerebral perfusion sometimes use . This technique allow adequate blood flow brain , monitor use special sticker sensor . The sensor apply patient 's forehead , correspond monitor indicate oxygen level front part brain . The goal study find sticker applied base skull measure cerebral oxygenation back brain , determine back brain adequately oxygenate selective cerebral perfusion patient undergo complex aortic arch reconstruction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One know risk pediatric heart surgery possibility brain damage . In may case problem result lack oxygen rick blood flow brain surgery . Recently , technique develop allows adequate blood flow brain surgery , thus decrease chance brain injury occur result heart surgery . This technique , call selective cerebral perfusion , technique choice surgeon operate repair aortic arch , sometimes use . The aorta main artery come heart carry oxygen rick blood body . This large vessel connect heart one end extend upward form arch . At top arch , three vessel branch provide upper part body , include brain , blood . In patient deformity aortic arch , necessary operate ensure flow blood body adequate uninterrupted . In order provide baby 's brain blood operation , technique mention earlier call selective cerebral perfusion use . In order understand selective cerebral perfusion work , important know patient place cardiopulmonary bypass surgery . During cardiopulmonary bypass , machine use pump blood body . This allow surgeon work heart surround artery still provide blood flow brain body . In past , surgery involve correction abnormality aortic arch , cardiopulmonary bypass would stop arch drain blood , mean would periods time baby 's brain would receive blood flow . With selective cerebral perfusion , small Gore-Tex shunt attach one blood vessel branch aortic arch . Blood cardiopulmonary bypass machine pump shunt enters artery branch aorta eventually travels neck brain . Other study show pump blood vessel allow front portion brain receive blood aortic arch abnormality correct . These study show use two sticker special sensor connect monitor . These sticker , place baby 's forehead , show monitor whether front part brain receiving blood . There two part study , part 1 used ass feasibility : Part 1 : The goal part one find sticker accurately show whether blood get back brain . Patients undergoing heart surgery get complex aortic arch reconstruction enrol part 1 . Part 2 : If find sticker work , part 2 enroll patient undergo complex aortic arch reconstruction . The goal part 2 find technique know selective cerebral perfusion effective get blood back brain complex aortic arch reconstruction . The study procedure part 1 2 , one sticker place normal position forehead , sticker place base skull . Application data collect sticker part 1 2 affect surgical treatment .</detailed_description>
