	<brief_title>Screening Methods Finding Lung Cancer Early Current Former Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To develop new multi-modal screening strategy integrate method detect lung cancer early current former smoker . - To evaluate impact screen modality quality life participant . - To develop decision analytic framework determine cost effectiveness novel lung cancer screen strategy Canada . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Participants undergo spirometry baseline . Participants also undergo spiral CT scan baseline 1 2 year . Participants semi-solid solid nodule 5-10 mm ground glass opacity ( GGO ) 8-10 mm growth exist nodule , development solid component GGO , new nodule undergo additional CT scan 3 month . Some participant also undergo autofluorescence white light bronchoscopy bronchial biopsy . Blood sample collect baseline annually 2 year biomarker study . Participants diagnose lung cancer undergo additional blood sample collection biomarker study . Participants complete questionnaire sociodemographic factor , smoking , occupational exposure , family history , medical data , quality life , anxiety baseline every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
