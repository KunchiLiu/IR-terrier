	<brief_title>Saracatinib Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 6-month survival biomarker-positive patient previously treat metastatic pancreatic cancer receive AZD0530 ( saracatinib ) . II . To determine adverse event drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate patient treat drug . II . To evaluate overall survival patient treated drug . III . To explore pharmacodynamic effect AZD0530 optional tumor biopsy , pharmacokinetic study , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan subset patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive saracatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
