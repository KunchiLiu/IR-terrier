	<brief_title>Lid Margin And Conjunctival Microbial Flora Following Punctum Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate impact punctal occlusion ocular microbial flora . Current think punctal occlusion cause retention inflammatory mediator ocular surface may produce pathology , hypothesize blockage nasolacrimal drainage system may allow colonization ocular surface potentially pathogenic ubiquitous organism ( may produce exotoxin biologic product ) may responsible sign symptom see patient . Additionally , presence silicone foreign body ( punctal plug ) may act nidus bacterial adhesion biofilm production ( know occur Pseudomonas sp organism ) . There would thus paradigm shift current understanding pathophysiology punctal occlusion . Additionally , choice antimicrobial treatment infection patient punctal occlusion may need modify microbial flora find different patient punctal occlusion . The ocular flora may different inpatient severe dry eye chronic pathologic condition , frequent indication punctal occlusion . However , retrospective review , could determine change microbial flora follow plug placement colonization `` unusual organism '' since baseline culture prior punctal plug placement obtain . We try differentiate effect microbial flora cause silicone plug acrylic plug ( foreign body ) versus punctal closure thermocautery . ( Punctal thermocauterization alternative method punctal closure 1 ) prefer choice ophthalmologist case , 2 ) dry eye severe irreversible punctal occlusion desire 3 ) punctal plug retain due large size patient punctal ) . The thermodynamic hydrophobic acrylic plug ( SmartPLUG ) approve FDA punctal occlusion indication traditional silicone plug .</detailed_description>
