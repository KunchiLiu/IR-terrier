	<brief_summary>The Electronic Device - The RebiSmart™ electronic injection device study delivery Merck Serono 's Rebif® New Formulation . The RebiSmart™ device stand-alone hand-held device internal power supply . It use subcutaneous ( skin ) injection single-use sterile disposable needle . The device keep storage box place refrigerator use . The key feature RebiSmart™ follow : - Battery power electromechanical automatic injector ; - Automatic needle attachment detachment ; - Hidden needle injection ; - Injection initiate press injection button contact skin ; - Automatic needle insertion injection preset dose subcutaneous ( skin ) tissue ; - Adjustable injection comfort parameter : Injection depth , needle insertion speed , medication injection speed time needle remain skin ; - Cartridges 3 dos Rebif® New Formulation ; - Several electronic function include history ( date time ) cartridge change injection . The Study Drug - Rebif® New Formulation ( RNF ) Rebif® medicine part family proteins call interferon beta-1a ( IFN-β-1a ) molecules play important role immune system help limit damage occur multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The interferon Rebif® like body 's natural human interferon , make outside body process call `` recombinant DNA technology '' . Merck Serono International S.A. ( maker Rebif® ) recently update method make Rebif® , refer Rebif® New Formulation ( RNF ) . For purpose study , form Rebif® New Formulation ( RNF ) differ slightly one currently receive . RNF supply pre-filled cartridge contain three dos 44mcg / 0.5 ml IFN-β-1a . This amount require administer course one full week treatment . The dosage RNF 44mcg inject skin three time per week . The RebiSmart™ device provide administration RNF . RNF administer , possible , time ( preferably late afternoon evening ) three day ( e.g . Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) , least 48 hour break administration . You ask record time date injection diary card provide . You teach properly use device inject medication . You also remind rotate injection site advise importance avoid already inflame area future injection . The goal research trial : - To evaluate electronic device use ( suitable ) MS patient perform self-injections Rebif® New Formulation . - To determine MS patient overall satisfaction new RebiSmart™ device determine ease use , often side effect happen ( flu-like symptom , injection site reaction overall injection issue ) may experience trial . This do completion Patient User Trial Questionnaire Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Concern Questionnaire ( MSTCQ ) . - To evaluate specific feature RebiSmart™ device answer MS patient provide User Trial Questionnaire . The MS patient person train proper use device complete questionnaire .</brief_summary>
