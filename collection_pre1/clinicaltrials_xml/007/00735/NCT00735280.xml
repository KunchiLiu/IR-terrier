	<detailed_description>Percutaneous coronary intervention , mostly implantation bare-metal drug-eluting stent , commonly use treat patient coronary artery disease . Various periprocedural adjunct antithrombotic therapy investigate use . Unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) standard adjunctive antithrombin therapy PCI 25 year . Combined antiplatelet treatment consist aspirin thienopyridine significantly reduce early ischaemic event follow coronary stenting ( 1 ) . Thienopyridines act irreversibly inhibit platelet adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) P2Y12 receptor . Compared ticlopidine , clopidogrel advantage favourable side effect profile ( 2 ) rapid onset action . ( 3,4 ) Pretreatment load dose 300mg clopidogrel improve outcome ( 5-7 ) recommend current guideline patient undergo PCI . ( 8 ) More recently , trial show large load dose 600mg achieves rapid potent inhibition platelet aggregation 300 mg . ( 9-11 ) The result several randomize controlled trial suggest pretreatment 600mg clopidogrel might obviate need IIb/IIIa inhibitor broad spectrum patient undergo PCI ( 12-14 ) although formal direct comparison different clopidogrel dos assess trial sufficiently power clinical endpoint . The Intracoronary Stenting Antithrombotic Regimen-Rapid Early Action Coronary Treatment ( ISAR-REACT ) trial show pretreatment 600mg clopidogrel least 2 hour intervention , additional use abciximab associate clinically measurable benefit among low-to-intermediate risk patient underwent PCI . ( 12 ) Even high risk setting small vessel size ( 14 ) presence diabetes ( 13 ) additional use abciximab associate measurable clinical benefit patient pretreated 600mg clopidogrel . An important exception group patient non-ST-segment elevation ACS . In ISAR-REACT-2 trial enrol category patient elevate troponin level benefit abciximab even pretreatment 600mg clopidogrel . ( 15 ) The recently complete ISAR-REACT-3 trial compare unfractionated heparin direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin biomarker negative patient stable unstable angina undergoing contemporary PCI . Bivalirudin provide `` net clinical benefit '' - reduce quadruple endpoint - 30 day compare unfractionated heparin . However , significant reduction bleed bivalirudin ( 16 ) The heparin dose regimen use ISAR-REACT-3 diverges current US practice insofar majority patient receive bolus dose 140 U/kg follow ACT measurement additional heparin dos . Although heparin standard antithrombin therapy interventional cardiology decade , optimal dose still know . During last year trend towards use low heparin dos . In interventional trial United States current practice use bolus 100 U/kg . ( 8 ) Many interventionalists believe dose low 140 U/kg associate well clinical outcome . However , study perform identify appropriate dose heparin . Since pretreatment clopidogrel proven reduce ischemic event , heparin dose 140U/kg might conceivably high . A low dose might prove effective prevent ischemic endpoint reduce risk bleed patient pretreated 600mg clopidogrel prior intervention . Therefore aim trial evaluate whether reduction heparin dose 140 100 U/kg associate well net clinical outcome patient undergo PCI pretreatment 600mg clopidogrel . The hypothesis test whether reduce dose 100U/kg heparin superior high dose 140U/kg use ISAR-REACT-3 trial ( historical control ) regard combine incidence death , myocardial infarction , urgent target vessel revascularization within 30 day hospital major bleeding . The ISAR-REACT-3a trial enroll patient population similar risk profile patient include ISAR-REACT-3 . Biomarker negative patient stable unstable angina undergo PCI receive reduce dose heparin bolus 100U/kg . Results compare ISAR-REACT-3 trial ( historical control ) . Primary comparison heparin arm ISAR-REACT-3 regard primary endpoint ( `` Net clinical benefit '' , combine incidence death , myocardial infarction , urgent target vessel revascularization within 30 day hospital major bleeding ) . A secondary aspect comparison historical bivalirudin group ISAR-REACT-3 trial .</detailed_description>
