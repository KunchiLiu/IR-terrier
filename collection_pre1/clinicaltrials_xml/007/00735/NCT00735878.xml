	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : The primary objective study follow : • To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) escalate ABT-751 combination fix dose carboplatin patient advance non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . • To evaluate efficacy combination ABT-751 carboplatin patient advance NSCLC • To determine median survival study population Secondary Objectives The secondary objective : • To characterize pharmacokinetic profile ABT-751 give combination carboplatin subset patient , treat MTD recommend dos Phase 2 . • To determine pharmacodynamics ABT-751 single agent combination ABT-751 carboplatin evaluate cell cycle analysis buccal mucosa cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic &amp; Pharmacodynamic Study ABT-751 With Carboplatin Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This primary objective Phase 1/2 study evaluate DLT MTD escalate oral dos ABT-751 give BID Day 1 cycle 7 day combination carboplatin give 21-day schedule . The carboplatin dose fix AUC 6 administer Day 4 first cycle facilitate pharmacokinetic analysis . During subsequent cycle agent administer Day 1 . ABT-751 administer follow dose level use Simon rapid dose escalation model : 100 , mg , 125 mg , 150 mg , 175 mg 200 mg BID . Initially , 1 patient enrol dose level 1 . If patient experience Grade 2 toxicity , additional 2 patient enrol dose level . If 1 3 patient experience Grade 3 ( high toxicity ) , cohort expand 6 patient . However , 1 patient complete one cycle assign dose regimen without experience Grade 2 toxicity , enrollment next cohort ( dose level 2 ) begin . This rapid dose escalation scheme apply cohort 1 3 . Initially , 4th cohort ( dose level 4 ) , minimum three patient enrol . If 1 3 patient experience Grade 3 ( high toxicity ) , cohort expand 6 patient . However , 3 patient complete one cycle assign dose regimen without experience Grade 3 ( high toxicity ) , enrollment next cohort ( dose level 5 ) begin . This scheme apply cohort 4 , 5 , 6 MTD define high dose ABT-751 give combination carboplatin few 33 % patient experience DLT . MTD evaluate end first cycle ( 21 day ) . Toxicities determine also end cycle 2 evaluate safety combine agent day 1 . If MTD determine completion 6th cohort ( dose level 6 ) , base overall review toxicity cohort , Investigator may select dose think recommend dose Phase 2 study . Six patient treat MTD undergo PK PD evaluation . An additional cohort 14-20 patient enrol either MTD recommend Phase 2 dose level administer drug day 1 . During portion study patient withdraw study follow occur : • Patient patient 's legally acceptable representative decides withdraw consent . • Patient 's response therapy unsatisfactory , evidence progression disease define RECIST Criteria Tumor Response ( within 2 cycle ) • The patient experience toxicity deem possibly probably related drug resolve least Grade 2 low within three week . • The patient require one dose reduction toxicity attributable ABT-751 . • The patient require study period alternate antineoplastin agent , concurrent radiotherapy surgery measurable site ( ) disease . • The patient become pregnant begin breast-feed . • The investigator believe best interest patient discontinue study drug administration . If grade 3 high toxicity develop 2 first 6 patient receive drug day 1 dose level toxicity note ABT-751 day 1/carboplatin day 4 schedule , additional patient second portion study receive latter schedule . If toxicity characteristic carboplatin ( myelosuppression others ) observe AUC 6 dose , carboplatin dose lower AUC 4.5 follow dose escalation schema employ , begin ABT-751 dose one toxicity develop : All patient receive antiemetic prior carboplatin . A regimen dexamethasone 10 mg dolasetron 100 mg IV prior carboplatin infusion may use . The study enrollment limit patient advanced NSCLC . Treatment continue progression disease , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal informed consent . Male female cancer patient select participate study accord selection criterion .</detailed_description>
