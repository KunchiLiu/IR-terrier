	<brief_title>A Trial Treatment Stage IIIB IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II trial address issue bevacizumab treatment duration treatment safety incorporate bevacizumab variation ECOG reference regimen first-line therapy patient non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer . Following disease progression treatment failure , potential benefit continue bevacizumab therapy test randomize patient two treatment arm , include second-line chemotherapy without bevacizumab . For first-line treatment , regimen carboplatin , docetaxel , bevacizumab follow maintenance bevacizumab therapy give patient . Upon disease progression treatment failure , patient randomize one two second-line regimen : pemetrexed plus bevacizumab pemetrexed monotherapy .</detailed_description>
