	<brief_title>Randomized Study Pessary Versus Standard Management Women With Increased Chance Premature Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prematurity responsible half neonatal death whilst advance neonatal care dramatically improve survival extremely premature infant , remain significant risk handicap disability survivor associate social economic burden . In singleton pregnancy rate spontaneous premature birth 34 week 1 % risk spontaneous early delivery inversely related cervical length . The group cervix 1-15 mm account 28 % spontaneous delivery 34 week cervix 16-25 mm account 21 % . The rate spontaneous premature birth 34 week 13 % twin pregnancy . Potential method prevention preterm delivery include bed rest , cervical cerclage prophylactic administration progesterone . The prophylactic administration progesterone begin mid-gestation woman previously premature birth short cervix show reduce rate spontaneous preterm birth 34 week . On hand , randomize study report , twin pregnancy , bed rest associate significant increase , rather decrease , rate early preterm delivery . There evidence rate premature birth dramatically reduce insertion vaginal pessary ( cerclage pessary , CE0482 , MED/CERT ISO 9003 / EN 46003 ) . This multicenter trial UK country . During routine ultrasound scan 20-24 week gestation examination fetal anatomy growth , woman twin pregnancy singleton pregnancy find cervix &lt; 25 mm length fetuses found alive major abnormality , severe twin twin transfusion syndrome severe fetal growth restriction one fetuses ( case twin pregnancy ) , invited participate randomize trial standard management vs vaginal insertion cerclage pessary . For singleton pregnancy , arm patient cervical length &lt; 15 mm give prophylactic progesterone ( 200 mg vaginal capsule per night 34 week ) . Randomization insertion pessary ( allocate group ) carry within 5 day 20-24 week scan . The pessary remove simple vaginal examination 37 week earlier medically indicated preterm induction labor elective cesarean section . The pessary also remove woman preterm labor respond tocolytic therapy . In monochorionic twin obstetrician advise delivery carry around 36 week .</detailed_description>
