	<brief_summary>Hyperglycemia common critically ill patient associated adverse outcome . Recently , large randomize controlled trial demonstrate tight glycaemic control ( TGC ) reduce morbidity mortality population . Based emerge evidence intensive insulin therapy currently find way critical care practice . In meantime numerous insulin infusion protocol , base frequent bedside glucose monitoring , implement . Recent review compare different type protocol describe widely range practice difficulty achieve TGC despite extensive effort intensive care unit ( ICU ) staff . A fully automate algorithm may help overcome limitation exclude intuitive intervention integrate relevant clinical data decision-making process . The primary objective current study investigate performance ( efficacy ) control algorithm glycaemic control ICU patient whole length ICU stay .</brief_summary>
