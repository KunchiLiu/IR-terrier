	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness experimental treatment regimen hepatitis C ( HCV ) . Standard treatment consist combination therapy ribavirin , take mouth twice day , Peginterferon , inject skin week . Hepatitis C genotypes 2 3 high success rate regimen , genotype 1 difficult treat . This study determine patient genotype 1 respond well treatment use high dose ribavirin standard approve dose 1,000 1,200 mg daily . Patients 18 year age old chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 successfully treated standard course Peginterferon ribavirin may eligible study . Participants eligible receive Peginterferon plus twice standard dose ribavirin ( 2,000 2,400 mg daily ) 48 week . In addition treatment , patient receive undergo following : Before Treatment : - Medical history physical examination , symptom questionnaire , blood test , urine collection , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram , liver ultrasound , Fibroscan ( ultrasound measure stiffness liver ) pregnancy test woman able child . - Patients medical condition special risk factor may evaluations start treatment . These may include , example , eye evaluation patient diabetes , exercise stress test people age 40 risk factor heart disease psychiatric evaluation people depression anxiety disorder . During Treatment - Periodic blood test monitor blood count viral level . - Outpatient clinic visit every 4 week duration study laboratory test review symptoms treatment side effect . Physical examination urine test do every 12 week . Following Completion Treatment About 1 1/2 year start treatment , subject re-evaluated start treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Ribavirin Peginterferon Treat Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 60 patient chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection previously treat standard dos peginterferon ribavirin ( 1000 1200 mg daily ) virological response ( non-responders : n=35 ) relapse therapy ( relapsers : n = 25 ) re-treated use peginterferon high dos ribavirin ( 2000 2400 mg daily ) . After medical evaluation , documentation eligibility write informed consent , patient start therapy standard dos peginterferon alfa-2a ( 180 micro g per week ) twice standard dose ribavirin ( 2000 mg daily patient le 75 kg ; 2400 mg daily patient great equal 75 kg ) . Viral kinetics evaluate basis change HCV RNA level first 24 week therapy blood sample do day 0 , 1 , 2 week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 24 . Patients fail decrease level HCV RNA 2 log ( 10 ) IU/ml week 12 consider non-responders therapy stop . Similarly , patient become HCV RNA negative ( less 10 IU ) week 24 also consider non-responders therapy discontinue . Patients become HCV RNA negative first 24 week therapy continue 48 week follow least 24 week thereafter . The primary end-point study sustain virological response ( SVR ) , define absence detectable HCV RNA serum treatment least 24 week stop therapy . The SVR rate re-treatment use conventional dos peginterferon ribavirin expect less 5 percent . The estimated rate SVR use peginterferon high dos ribavirin 50 percent patient previous relapse 25 percent previous non-response . A sample size 35 patient would need achieve statistical significance base upon estimate response rate non-responders 25 patient relapsers . If none first ten non-responder patient treat protocol achieve SVR , non-responder patient enrol part study terminate early . Patients also monitor closely side effect therapy , major one ribavirin anemia . Patients develop anemia treat darbepoietin maintain hemoglobin level 10 gm percent . This pilot study expect demonstrate whether use high dos ribavirin option patient fail adequate response conventional dos peginterferon ribavirin chronic hepatitis C .</detailed_description>

Written informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Age great 65 year If cirrhosis present , decompensated liver disease , mark serum bilirubin great 4 mg percent , albumin less 3.0 gm percent , prothrombin time great 2 sec prolong , history bleed esophageal varix , ascites hepatic encephalopathy . Serum Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) level great 1000 U/L ( great 25 time ULN ) . Such patient enrol may follow three determination level .

Breastfeeding . Significant systemic major illness include congestive heart failure , organ transplantation , serious psychiatric disease depression , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , angina pectoris . Previous intolerance weight base ribavirin dose ( 1,0001,200 mg daily ) include need dose reduction , use erythropoietin serious adverse event attributable ribavirin use . Renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance le 60 ml/min ) renal failure Pre exist anemia ( hematocrit le 34 percent ) know history hemolytic anemia . Uncontrolled hypertension diabetes mellitus Other antiviral therapy within last 6 month . Immunosuppressive therapy either corticosteroid ( 5 mg prednisone daily ) major immunosuppressive agent ( azathioprine 6mercaptopurine ) . Evidence another form liver disease addition viral hepatitis ( example autoimmune liver disease , Wilson disease , alcoholic liver disease , hemochromatosis , alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency ) . Evidence coronary artery disease cerebral vascular disease , include abnormality exercise stress test patient define risk factor screen evidence underlie coronary artery disease . Active substance abuse , alcohol , inhale injection drug within previous year . Evidence hepatocellular carcinoma ; either alphafetoprotein ( AFP ) level great 200 ng/ml ( normal less 9 ng/ml ) and/or ultrasound ( image study ) demonstrate mass suggestive liver cancer . Clinical gout . Active , serious autoimmune disease , lupus erythematosis , ulcerative colitis , Crohn disease rheumatoid arthritis opinion investigator might exacerbate therapy peginterferon . Uncontrolled thyroid disease Evidence severe retinopathy clinically relevant ophthalmological disorder ( patient preexist hypertension diabetes undergo ophthalmological assessment ) .</criteria>
