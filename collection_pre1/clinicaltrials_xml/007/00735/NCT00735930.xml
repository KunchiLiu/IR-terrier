	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Alvocidib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) flavopiridol ( alvocidib ) combination lenalidomide patient relapsed refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) . II . To define specific toxicity dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) flavopiridol combination lenalidomide treatment patient relapse refractory CLL/SLL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess preliminary efficacy flavopiridol combine lenalidomide patient relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL justify future , rigorous phase II study combination CLL . II . To determine pharmacokinetics flavopiridol lenalidomide alone combination patient CLL/SLL . III . To correlate select pre-treatment prognostic marker , include interphase cytogenetics minimal residual disease , progression-free survival , response , toxicity follow combination therapy flavopiridol lenalidomide . IV . To determine patient cytokine expression profile immediately pre-treatment , flavopiridol dosing , combination flavopiridol lenalidomide therapy assess impact lenalidomide flavopiridol induce cytokine release ( interleukin [ IL ] -6 ) . V. To assess pre-treatment ex vivo vivo ( day 1 day 3 lenalidomide ) immune ( B-cell , natural killer [ NK ] cell , T-cell ) activation correlate response toxicity lenalidomide therapy . VI . To assess vivo effect lenalidomide flavopiridol modulation select intracellular pharmacodynamic target include signal transducer activator transcription 3 ( acute-phase response factor ) ( STAT3 ) , myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 ( BCL2-related ) ( Mcl-1 ) , downstream IL-6 target . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lenalidomide . Patients receive alvocidib intravenously ( IV ) 4.5 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 course 1 follow week rest . Beginning course 2 subsequent course , patient receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 alvocidib IV 4.5 hour day 3 , 10 , 17 . Treatment repeat every 35 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
