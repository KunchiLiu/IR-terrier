	<brief_summary>Blood flow brain normally regulated ensure constant supply blood oxygen nutrient . During heart surgery use cardiopulmonary bypass , blood pressure keep level may may individual 's low level brain blood flow autoregulation . If low , brain may expose inadequate blood flow could result brain damage . The purpose study examine whether monitor non-invasive FDA approve device measure oxygen saturation superficial layer brain ( near infrared spectroscopy ) , combine blood pressure measurement , provide information blood pressure level brain blood flow autoregulated . The goal research develop method individualize blood pressure surgery level within patient 's brain blood flow autoregulation range mean improve outcome patient undergoing heart surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring Cerebral Blood Flow Autoregulation Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) normally autoregulated within range blood pressure , thus , allow constant cerebral O2 supply commensurate metabolic demand . The low limit blood pressure general anesthesia deem tolerable usually empirically choose without regard individual 's low autoregulatory threshold . This practice may lead cerebral hypoperfusion patient place risk cerebral ischemic injury . This particularly true cardiac surgery use cardiopulmonary bypass mean blood pressure maintain level great 50 mm Hg even low surgical mandate situation . This practice concern rise number age surgical patient cerebral vascular disease prone cerebral hypoperfusion . Individualizing blood pressure within patient 's autoregulatory range would likely ensure adequate CBF surgery . In study evaluate whether real-time monitoring use near infra-red spectroscopy ( NIRS ) base method accurately detect low CBF autoregulation threshold patient compare validated , technically challenge method CBF autoregulation measurement use transcranial Doppler . This approach involve continuous calculation move linear regression correlation coefficient blood pressure cerebral O2 saturation measure NIRS surrogate CBF . A correlation coefficient , term cerebral oximetery index , generate displayed versus blood pressure . When CBF dysregulated , correlation coefficient become markedly positive indicate CBF pressure passive . We assess added value type monitoring detect low CBF autoregulatory threshold compare prediction base preoperative blood pressure . These aim address study 178 patient great 60 year age undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and/or valve surgery use cardiopulmonary bypass . Due many hemodynamic fluctuation cardiac surgery , autoregulatory threshold determine without administration vasoactive drug . Neurological complication important source patient morbidity , mortality , hospital cost , impaired quality life cardiac type surgery . NIRS monitor non-invasive , continuous , require little caregiver intervention , thus , would wide applicability provide information CBF autoregulation variety clinical setting include cardiac surgery . This adoption could enhance likely development `` plug-and-play '' monitor .</detailed_description>
