	<brief_summary>Preterm newborns typically must thermally regulate . In United States , isolettes ( incubator ) use help maintain temperature . Traditionally , temperature support ( i.e . temperature incubator ) decrease slowly accord NICU protocol baby able maintain temperature open crib , without regard status feeding . This study attempt determine difference length stay , weight gain , calorie need gain appropriate weight group newborns whose isolette temperature decrease aggressive strategy ( isolette temperature decrease base baby 's body temperature ) , group newborn whose isolette temperature decrease conservative strategy ( isolette temperature decrease minimum temperature keep steady feed caloric goal take least half feed mouth ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weaning Thermoregulatory Support Preterm Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Background : There three key milestone premature infant must meet prior discharge NICU : 1 . The ability maintain temperature open crib 2 . The ability consume enough calorie adequate growth oral feed 3 . A demonstrated weight gain consume feed . It well understood infant must increase rest metabolic rate wean isolette open crib ( 1 , 6 ) . Preterm neonates less metabolic reserve ( brown fat ) allow mount appropriate thermogenic response cold stress ( 4 ) . The reserve often deplete delivery , leave little reserve ( 4 ) . When neonate challenge maintain body temperature , must increase heat production may affect weight gain ( 3 ) . Some institution wean without regard neonate ` weight feeding status , others begin wean process predetermine weight . Currently neonates wean isolettes base largely tradition experience clinician , without regard feeding status . However , currently little evidence literature inform practice ideal condition wean neonate isolette . An extensive literature review reveal publish data regard relationship feed status success isolette wean . The transfer open crib important ; neonate able maintain his/her temperature , length stay could lengthen weight gain adversely affect ( 3 ) . Cold stress also cause adverse clinical effect include lethargy , hypotonia , poor feeding , abdominal distention , vomit , pallor , tachypnea , respiratory distress ( 2 ) . These adverse clinical effect may also lengthen cost length stay , well adversely affect feeding . Furthermore , return isolette quite stressful parent family member ( 3 ) . Subjects : Approximately 110 subject recruit . The subject study live bear preterm infant 26 0/7 week gestation 34 6/7 week gestation . Informed consent obtain parent . Methods : Neonates randomly assign either control group ( standard thermoregulatory wean protocol ) vs. experimental group ( conservative thermoregulatory wean protocol ) . After infant enrol study , envelope indicate random assignment either aggressive conservative group drawn infant assign indicated study group . The envelope provide statistician deliver group 10 ensure relatively equal number baby study group . All infant advance goal caloric feed 120 Kcal/kg . Weight gain measure biweekly , adequate weight gain ( average 20 grams/kg/day ) reach , feed advance 10 Kcal/kg/day biweekly adequate weight gain reach . All infant keep skin control mode weigh 1500 gram . Babies skin control mode unclothe except diaper . Once infant reach 1500 gram , place air control mode . Babies air control mode dress one medium-weight sleeper foot ( sock sleeper footless ) , one hat , blanket clothe . Control Group : Aggressive Wean Weaning Process : - If baby ` temperature great equal 36.7°C 2 consecutive measurement 3 hour apart , isolette set temperature lower 0.2°C . - If baby ` temperature le 36.3°C 1 measurement , isolette set temperature increase 0.2°C . - Once baby ` temperature stable great 36.7°C 3 consecutive measurement 3 hour apart isolette set temp 28.0°C , baby transfer open crib . At time , baby dress one medium-weight sleeper foot ( sock sleeper footless ) , one hat , sleep sack . NO heavy blanket ( bath blanket ) extra blanket use . - If baby ` temperature le 36.3°C 1 measurement , transfer back isolette weaning process begin . Experimental Group : Conservative Wean Weaning Process : - If baby ` temperature great equal 37.2°C 2 consecutive measurement 3 hour apart , isolette set temperature lower 0.2°C . - If baby ` temperature le 36.3°C 1 measurement , isolette set temperature increase 0.2°C . - Once baby ` temperature stable great 37.2°C 3 consecutive measurement 3 hour apart isolette set temp 28.0°C , AND baby take full caloric need feed ( least 120 Kcal/kg/day ) , AND baby take half feed mouth baby transfer open crib . At time , baby dress one medium-weight sleeper foot ( sock sleeper footless ) , one hat , sleep sack . NO heavy blanket ( bath blanket ) extra blanket use . - If baby ` temperature stable great 37.2°C 4 consecutive measurement 3 hour apart isolette set temp 28.0°C , baby ` temperature great 37.9°C isolette set temp 28.0°C , baby transfer open crib regardless feed status . At time , baby dress one medium-weight sleeper foot ( sock sleeper footless ) , one hat , sleep sack . NO heavy blanket ( bath blanket ) extra blanket use . - If baby ` temperature le 36.3 degree Celsius 1 measurement , transfer back isolette weaning process begin . Research Significance Future Research : This study provide data regard wean thermoregulatory support preterm infant , could significant economic impact university significant difference length stay study group . Future research focus long-term effect outcomes nutritional status infancy BMI childhood neonate require great caloric intake wean thermoregulatory support faster . Bibliography : 1 .
