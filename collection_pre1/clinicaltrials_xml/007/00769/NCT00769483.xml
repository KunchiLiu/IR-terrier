	<detailed_description>Phase I The Study Drugs : MK-0646 design block protein think cause cancer cell grow spread . This drug may help slow growth tumor . Gemcitabine design disrupt growth cancer cell , may cause cancer cell die . Erlotinib hydrochloride design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell may control growth survival cancer cell . This may stop cancer cell grow . Study Drug Dose Level Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign group ( Arm A Arm B ) base join study , many participant enrol , safety data available time . - If Arm A , receive MK-0646 gemcitabine . - If Arm B , receive MK-0646 , gemcitabine , erlotinib hydrochloride . There 2 dose level MK-0646 arm . There 3-6 participant enrol dose level arm . Enrollment begin Arm A . Arm B use 2 dose level Arm A . If first dose level Arm A find tolerable , least 3 patient enrolled Arm B , Level 1 , least 3 patient enrol Arm A , Level 2 . If Arm B , Level 1 Arm A , Level 2 safely give , last group 3-6 patient enrol Arm B , Level 2 . The first group participant arm receive low dose level . The next group arm receive high dose first group , intolerable side effect see . The dose gemcitabine and/or erlotinib hydrochloride every group . Study Drug Administration : If Arm A , Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day study cycle , receive gemcitabine needle vein 1 1/2 hour . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle , receive MK-0646 vein 1 hour .
