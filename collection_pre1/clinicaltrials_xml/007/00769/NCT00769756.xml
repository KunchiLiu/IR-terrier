	<detailed_description>Intervention : All family keep calorie-restriction diet assign random one three additional weight-loss strategy : ( 1 ) diet top calorie-restriction preference carbohydrate low glycemic index ( dual diet ) , ( 2 ) financial incentive , ( 3 ) continuous telemetric control weight physical activity ( telemonitoring ) . The design make possible determine effect single measure : financial incentive vs. financial incentive ( 54 vs.56 family ) , calorie-restriction vs. dual diet ( 53 vs. 57 fami-lies ) telemonitoring vs. telemonitoring ( 19 vs. 91 family ) . The design also allow assessment effect combination additional measure , adapt possible effect factor . Main Outcome In parent outcome variable 6 month relative weight loss . In child , be-cause body growth , outcome variable age-adjusted BMI standard deviation score ( BMI-SDS ) . Analysis do three-factorial ANOVA one-factorial ANOVA include Dunnett test post-hoc comparison , distinguish effect different combination additional strategy .</detailed_description>
