	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC . Patient must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . See Section 11 evaluation measurable nonmeasurable disease . Patients must receive least one previous chemotherapy regimen recurrent refractory disease . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use itraconazole combination pemetrexed patient &lt; 18 year age , patient exclude study eligible future pediatric phase 2 combination trial . Life expectancy great 12 week . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ; see Appendix A ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients receive prior pemetrexed chemotherapy . Patients uncontrolled brain metastasis . Patients brain metastasis must stable neurologic status follow local therapy ( surgery radiation ) least 2 week , must without neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition itraconazole pemetrexed agent use study . Itraconazole strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase plasma concentration drug metabolize pathway . Coadministration cisapride , midazolam , pimozide , quinidine , lovastatin , simvastatin , triazolam , dofetilide , levacetylmethadol ( levomethadyl ) itraconazole contraindicate . Patients take medication able change alternative medication exclude . Lists include medication substance know potential interact CYP3A4 isoenzymes provide Section 7.1 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study itraconazole pemetrexed Class C D agent , respectively , potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother itraconazole pemetrexed , breastfeed discontinue mother treated itraconazole pemetrexed . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction itraconazole pemetrexed . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
