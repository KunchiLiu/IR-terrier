	<detailed_description>Post-natal growth restriction become problem yet solve studied neonatal unit . Newborns low birth weight grow rate lower expect , thus culminate delay extra-uterine growth , term assessment , time discharge hospital , make search adequate nutrition critical issue . Although intrinsic risk factor related prematurity , nutritional approach neonatal unit staff play decisive role prevalence malnutrition . Although importance appropriate nutritional management premature infants clearly recognize , necessary nutrient requirement nutrient well establish yet uncertainty may contribute limited intake nutrient ( Hay et al , 1999 ) . When fresh extract mother´s milk , human milk consider preferred feed premature newborn , digestibility , balance chemical composition , capacity provide immunity prevention future disease ( AAP , 2003 ) . In addition , human milk associate low energy expenditure use comparison preterm formula , may promote newborn 's growth ( Lubetzky et al , 2003 ) . However , many advantage lose human milk come pool pasteurized , use associate inadequate weight gain nutritional deficit hospital stay . Thus sometimes necessary use human milk fortifier preterm formula , fee preterm infant , order increase caloric-protein supply weight gain . Milk formulas premature baby currently high caloric density well digest , capacity provide immunity . In face problem , several study progress know discus best nutritional approach premature newborns hospital stay . Among factor may impact approach energy expenditure originate type diet newborn caloric constituent ( macronutrients ) metabolize . In face aforesaid , follow question remain : Will individually adjust caloric density human formula milk feed newborns low birth weight actually impact energy expenditure ? 2 - OBJECTIVES 2.1 - GENERAL : - To compare energy expenditure preterm infant feed fortified human milk versus preterm infant formula 2.2 - SPECIFIC : - To analyze caloric content macronutrients ( fat , protein , lactose ) present human milk feed newborn low birth weight time indirect calorimetry test ; - To analyze impact caloric density milk feed newborn energy expenditure ; - To compare chemical composition milk offer newborn low birth weight use energy expenditure - To analyze impact energy substrate respiratory coefficient ; - To elaborate pre post-prandial energy expenditure curve newborn low birth weight type milk feed 3- MATERIALS AND METHODS 3.1 - Participants : Inclusion criterion : Newborns admit Intensive Care Unit Fernandes Figueira Institute birth weight 1500g , In order include study , newborns shall room air , stable growth , without electrolytic unbalance , feed gavage , 160/ml/ky/day fluid , alternate human milk formula prematurity . Newborns must tolerate whole diet , without significant gastric residue ( &gt; 5 % total diet ) . For ethical reason , newborn exclusively breastfeed include . 3.1.1 - Exclusion criterion : Newborns present follow exams shall exclude : significant gastric residue , sign symptom sepsis , repeat apnea event require use respiratory stimulant . 3.2 - Sample Size Calculation : Sample size 25 newborn low birth weight calculate base result obtain Lubetzky et al ( 2003 ) , consider 10 % difference energy expenditure human milk preterm formula . The level significance 95 % power test 99 % . MedCalc software use calculation . 3.3 - Study place The study carry Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Fernandes Figueira Institute ( IFF ) / Oswald Cruz Foundation ( FIOCRUZ ) , Rio de Janeiro - RJ . This research authorize Head Neonatology Department unit . 3.4 - Main Endpoint Energy expenditure adjust caloric density milk group measure open system indirect calorimetry pre po feed . 3.5 - Study design A randomized , control , crossover , double blind clinical trial carry newborn control . Randomization accord type diet begin study . Half participant randomly assign begin study use one type milk ( example , human milk ) later another type milk ( preterm infant formula ) half opposite . 3.6 Randomization blind Newborns low birth weight include study randomize use computer generate random number table , initially get human milk milk formula vice-versa . This study carry researcher train handle necessary equipment technique , well perform procedure . Initially Human Milk Bank request supply human milk caloric value 65 Kcal/100ml . When sent Milk Bank distribution , assess researcher staff , charge analyze caloric content macronutrients contain milk randomization well . After get `` diet A '' 24 hour , another researcher , `` blind '' , , know diet give , perform indirect calorimetry test , repeat 24 hour type diet . The researcher charge analyze result also `` blind '' , , know milk belongs `` diet A '' `` diet B '' . 3.7 - Study protocol Energy expenditure assessment Energy expenditure assessment perform indirect calorimetry , use Deltatrac II Metabolic Monitor ( Datex-Ohmeda , Helsink , Finland . This equipment base open circuit principle , allow measure oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) carbon dioxide production ( VCO2 ) , use continuous flow generator . The indirect calorimetry test perform 21st 28th day life , period newborn reach good metabolic stability . The newborn keep inside incubator , thermoneutral zone , hood cover face , without clothing accessory sock , glove cap , clean diaper , prone position , sleep state sleepiness . Temperature record thermometer attach infant 's skin . The choice prone position base fact position premature newborns remain quiet , addition many benefit provide related respiratory function . Body movement record indirect calorimetry test , follow scale propose Thureen ( 1998 ) , associate activity energy expenditure . Measurement interrupt infant awake active cry . Deltatrac II software printer connect , provide average value standard deviation follow parameter : baseline energy expenditure , expire CO2 volume , inspired CO2 volume percentage use carbohydrate , protein fat , end test . The indirect calorimetry test take place follow time : 60 minute diet administration , 30 minute diet gastroclysis 90 minute diet administration , total 180 minute . After one type diet 24 hour , indirect calorimetry test carry right infant feed type diet 24 hour , end another indirect calorimetry test perform . It necessary observe 24 hour washout period make sure interference nutrient previous diet , study show thermal effect food may last 18 hour . The feasibility obtain baseline status newborn , , status infant remain still long period time , assure fact newborn sleep 60 % time calm awake state 25 % time - metabolism low . On 15 % time , newborn either fed cry . Milk analysis In order ass human milk ingest newborn , time test 9 ml sample milk collect - 2ml analyzed use creamatocrit remain 7 ml send qualitative analysis protein , fat , lactose total caloric content , dosed spectrophotometry technique - use INFRARED ANALYSIS ( Milko-Scan Minor 104 , already validate human milk analysis . The human milk feed newborn , time test , shall caloric value least 65 Kcal/100ml . Formula milk calculate use information provide product label , consider volume dilution commonly use formula Pré-Nan . The value preterm formula constituent Carbohydrate 8,6g/100 ml , protein 2,3g/100 ml , fat 4,2g/100 ml total kcal 80 Kcal/100 ml . Population characteristics The following anthropometric data collect characterize population : weight , length , well variable relate birth - nutritional status neonatal practice . 3.8 - Analysis Data enter data base create use STATA analysis perform STATA software . The analysis result carry variance analysis ( ANOVA ) data normal distribution Kruskal-Wallis Wilcoxon non-parametric data continuous variable chi-square categoric variable . The regression model use analysis association variable set consider energy expenditure . The choice variable use regression model define base bivariate analysis . The result consider statistically significant p value &lt; 0.05 . 3.9- Presentation result Results present conformity standard suggest CONSORT , use flow diagram form four phase : selection , assignation , follow-up analysis , show scheme . 4.0- Ethical issue This project approve Institutional Review Board Research Human Beings Fernandes Figueira Institute , protocol number 0057.0.008.000-06 .
