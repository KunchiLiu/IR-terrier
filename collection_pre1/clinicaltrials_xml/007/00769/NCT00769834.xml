	<brief_summary>Papilledema define swell optic nerve often due increase intracranial pressure . When present , often indicate life-threatening lesion brain tumor , abscess , meningitis , encephalitis , venous sinus obstruction intracranial hemorrhage . A similar clinical picture also cause condition malignant hypertension , diabetic papillopathy uremia . When intracranial pressure elevate absence know cause call Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension ( IIH ) . Untreated papilledema cause progressive optic nerve damage blindness . Patients chronic kidney disease number co-morbidities thus increase risk develop papilledema . Although clinician observed patient kidney disease increase incidence papilledema ( unpublished data Corbett et al ) , study subject date . We believe high incidence papilledema find patient kidney disease study could provide evidence suggest routine ophthalmic screening patient group . Hypothesis : The prevalence optic disc swell increased patient chronic kidney disease . Purpose : To establish prevalence disc edema patient chronic kidney disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The craniospinal cavity enclose rigid , non-compressible bone thus constant volume . It fill soft tissue ( brain , spinal cord connective tissue ) , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) circulate blood . Intracranial pressure ( ICP ) pressure fluid bathe brain spinal cord . The ICP regulate fine balance production absorption CSF . Any disturbance volume content rigid craniospinal cavity cause alteration ICP . Intracranial pressure elevate number disease process space occupy lesion , abnormality production absorption CSF abnormalities circulation venous obstruction . Raised ICP symptomatically manifest headache , vomit , tinnitus diplopia addition neurologic symptom related lesion location type . The increased ICP transmit optic nerve cause papilledema , define swell optic nerve head ( papilla ) secondary raise ICP . Swelling optic nerve absence raise ICP term disc edema ( Parsons JH , Miller NR ) . Causes disc edema extensive include ischemic optic neuropathy , malignant hypertension , diabetic papillopathy , uremia , intracranial hypotension ( CSF leak ) . Papilledema consider medical emergency investigate mean neuroimaging ( evaluate intracranial lesion ) lumbar puncture ( evaluate opening pressure CSF content ) . A diagnosis Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension ( IIH ) make elevate ICP absence clinical , laboratory radiological evidence know cause raise ICP . The feared complication untreated papilledema progressive optic nerve atrophy result vision loss . Early recognition , investigation treatment papilledema cause prevent blindness . Patients chronic kidney disease number risk factor predispose development disc edema . Medical comorbidities hypertension diabetes mellitus increase risk optic nerve head diseases ischemic optic neuropathy diabetic papillopathy . Malignant hypertension , uremia dialysis dysequilibrium syndrome also know cause papilledema . There study English literature date , disc edema patient kidney disease . However , neuroophthalmologists clinically observe patient chronic kidney disease appear increase incidence optic nerve swell ( Corbett JJ , unpublished data ) . A study look optic nerve edema group patient overdue may determine additional guideline management patient chronic kidney disease . The patient enrol study undergo optic nerve head examination ophthalmoscopy identify patient disc edema . If disc edema detect screen examination , patient refer Neuroophthalmology service evaluation investigation determine management . The result neuroophthalmologic workup patient disc edema review ascertain etiology disc edema .</detailed_description>
