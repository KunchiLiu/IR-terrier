	<brief_summary>Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) traditional method palliative management patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Few previous study demonstrate serum level anticancer drug patient treat TACE similar treat systemic chemotherapy . Since systemic chemotherapy may possibility influence patient 's general defense ability , hepatitis B virus may reactivate chemotherapy.This study investigate possibility TACE reactivation hepatitis B virus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) common malignant tumor liver . Chronic hepatitis B infection common etiology development HCC . Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) traditional method palliative management patient HCC . Few previous study demonstrate serum level anticancer drug patient treat TACE similar treat systemic chemotherapy . Since systemic chemotherapy may possibility influence patient 's general defense ability , hepatitis B virus may reactivate chemotherapy . There study investigate possibility TACE reactivation hepatitis B virus . This project collect 20 patient HCC cause hepatitis B plan treated TACE . Quantitative determination viral load blood perform TACE , first third month TACE investigate influence TACE hepatitis B virus replication . This study influence doctor 's decision management HCC procedure TACE . The serum use HBV DNA examination concomitantly obtain regular blood sample TACE preparation follow-up patient . The amount blood need time HBV DNA examination le 10 ml .</detailed_description>
