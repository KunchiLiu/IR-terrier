	<brief_summary>Patients suffer heart failure markedly reduce pump capacity sometimes desynchronization low chamber heart high risk suffer sudden cardiac death . These patient treat Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator terminate dangerously fast heartbeat case asynchronous pump heart also re-synchronize low chamber heart ( ICD- CRT-D-system ) . Patients moreover suffer worsen cardiac status ( cardiac decompensation ) hospitalize reason high risc follow decompensations . New technology , incorporate modern Medtronic ICD- CRT-D-Systems , measure amount water lung able warn dangerous worsening occurs . If couple modern data transmit technology ( CareLink ) , automatic information case worsen cardiac status send caregiver , turn react timely order prevent worsen subsequent hospitalization . The study examine extent new technology prevents potentially adverse cardiac situation / hospitalization influence duration patient´s life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study establish whether use event-triggered HF-disease management Medtronic 's OptiVol® fluid status monitor automatically generate wireless CareAlert® notification clinician via Medtronic CareLink® Network reduce cardiovascular related hospitalization number death subject population HF ICD / CRT-D treatment compare standard clinical assessment . As measure reduction hospitalization deaths rate cause death cardiovascular related hospitalization determine .</detailed_description>
