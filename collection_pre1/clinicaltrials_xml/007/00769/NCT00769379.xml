	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy see well work without trastuzumab treat woman ductal carcinoma situ undergone lumpectomy . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective without trastuzumab treat ductal carcinoma situ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Trastuzumab Treating Women With Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Who Have Undergone Lumpectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine value trastuzumab give radiation therapy ( RT ) compare RT alone prevent subsequent occurrence ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence , ipsilateral skin cancer recurrence , ipsilateral ductal carcinoma situ ( IIBCR-SCR-DCIS ) woman human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive DCIS resect lumpectomy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine value trastuzumab give RT compare RT alone prolong invasive DCIS disease-free survival ( IDFS ) -DCIS . II . Determine value trastuzumab give RT compare RT alone increase invasive DCIS recurrence-free interval . III . Determine value trastuzumab give RT compare RT alone improve regional distant recurrence . IV . Determine value trastuzumab give RT compare RT alone improve incidence contralateral invasive DCIS breast cancer . V. Determine value trastuzumab give RT compare RT alone improve survival . VI . To explore effect trastuzumab ovarian function . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine benefit trastuzumab add RT significantly high v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog ( cMYC ) -amplified tumor cMYC non-amplified subset . II . To determine benefit trastuzumab add RT less tumor mutation phosphatidylinositol 3 ( PI3 ) kinase gene tumor without PI3 kinase gene mutation . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo standard whole breast irradiation ( WBI ) 5-6 week . ARM II : Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute week 1 4 . Patients also undergo WBI Arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year every 12 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
