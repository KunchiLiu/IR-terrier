	<brief_title>PET-CT Scans Healthy Volunteers After Flu Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until recently , recipient influenza vaccine receive killed form virus , typically nondominant arm , year flu season . We hypothesize natural infection , form vaccination , could allow vaccine induced response spread beyond local lymph node near vaccination site . From practical perspective , vaccine induce proliferation specific immune cell sit distant vaccination site lead beneficial immune memory , would suggest vaccination strategy could simple alternate injected arm year year , alternate inhale vs. inject form vaccine . This 4 arm prospective study individual receive unilateral FluShield i.m . Healthy adult volunteer 21-55 group accord follow criterion : I. Documented history prior natural infection influenza A B within past 5 year ( diagnostic test high titer HA Ab absence vaccination ) ; II . History FluMist vaccination within past 2 year ; III . History TIV vaccination , number time , single ( e.g. , non-dominant ) arm . Within one month screen baseline blood draw PBMCs Ab titer , individual receive FluShield injection . For individual prior history unilateral TIV injection , half receive shot arm always inject ( Group IIIa ) . The half individual receive Flushield opposite ( dominant ) arm ( Group IIIb ) . Upon enter study , 50cc heparinized blood 10 cc serum drawn antecubital venipuncture . Within 4 week blood draw , volunteer receive standard dose i.m . TIV ( FluShield ) . Four-seven day later FDG PET-CT scan perform 8 hour fast . Additional blood draw 50cc heparinized blood 10 cc serum obtain 2 , 4 , 6 week post vaccination , 10-12 month post vaccination . After last blood draw , volunteer also ask question pertain flu-like symptom past 10 month .</detailed_description>
