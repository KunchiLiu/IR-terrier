	<detailed_description>VA111913 TS selective V1a-receptor antagonist . The hypothesised mechanism action V1a receptor antagonist dysmenorrhea describe literature . Contractions uterine muscle require normal menstruation . Women dysmenorrhea increase uterine myometrial tone contraction decrease blood flow uterus . These abnormality show lead pain experience dysmenorrhea . Thus , drug able reduce hyperreactivity uterus physiological level pain experienced dysmenorrhea may control . In human , vasopressin , via V1a receptor , able potently induce contraction uterine smooth muscle uterine blood vessel . Thus , V1a receptor antagonist potentially inhibit contraction turn reduce pain experienced dysmenorrhea .</detailed_description>
