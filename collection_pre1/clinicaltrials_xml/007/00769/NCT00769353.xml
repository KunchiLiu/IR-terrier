	<detailed_description>Depression costly , worsens morbidity mortality , detrimental effect disease course physically ill population . This research take novel multi-dimensional approach assess neurobiological basis depression chronic pediatric physical illness use inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) model . It also evaluate efficacy modify cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) emotional well-being , physical health , economic cost , neurobiological outcome . These result provide key building block paradigm shift within medicine integrate behavioral health comprehensive medical care physical illness . Little known brain body interact increase depressive vulnerability , particularly youth . Adult study identify disruption limbic prefrontal brain activity pathophysiology depression . Cytokines secondary inflammation exogenous treatment steroid cause mood cognitive change brain region . It important understand neuropsychiatric effect IBD treatment underlie brain structure adolescence , critical developmental period brain maturation underlie emotional regulation cognitive processing . More importantly , neuronal plasticity adolescence may still allow reversibility disease-related brain effect teach cop strategy life-long illness management could change developmental trajectory reduce vulnerability adulthood . Using translational neuroscience approach , research examine : 1 ) brain region underlie emotional cognitive processing youth active IBD depression use brain functional magnetic resonance imaging compare youth IBD depression , normal control ; 2 ) inter-relationship depressive symptom IBD brain , immune , gastrointestinal functioning ; 3 ) efficacy combine CBT-physical illness narrative intervention target emotional cognitive processing compare supportive non-directive therapy depress IBD cohort longitudinal track emotional , physical health , economic , neurobiological outcome .</detailed_description>
