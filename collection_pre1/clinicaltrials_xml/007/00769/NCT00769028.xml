	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis ( scleroderma , SSc ) multisystemic disease clinically characterize fibrosis skin , joint , muscle internal organ . Systemic sclerosis rare disease , estimate incidence 19 individual per million population per year . The pathogenesis SSc remain incompletely understood although seem likely interplay inflammatory , vascular fibroblast dysfunction , lead ultimately sustain activation population fibroblasts deposit increase amount extracellular matrix lesional tissue , include skin internal organ . Impairment immune system currently think play important role . This base observation early phase SSc , mononuclear cell migrate dermis accumulate around small blood vessel , nerve skin appendage . Furthermore , direct relation extent cutaneous inflammation extent progression fibrosis skin . Stimulated T-lymphocytes patient SSc produce tumor necrosis factor-Î± , interleukin-1 -2 compare healthy control serum concentration IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 IL-8 soluble IL-2 receptor elevate . The occurrence autoantibody , predominantly antitopoisomerase-1 ( ATA ) anticentromere antibody ( ACA ) , approximately 90 % patient , point alteration humoral immune system . Systemic sclerosis subdivide diffuse limited form . Diffuse cutaneous SSc ( dcSSc ) characterise skin involvement proximal elbow knee , limit cutaneous SSc ( lcSSc ) skin involvement distal joint . In approximately 50 % patient dcSSc , ATA detect , approximately 50 % patient lcSSc ACAs present . Other hallmark autoantibody also identify small proportion SSc patient include anti-RNA polymerase I/III anti-fibrillarin antibody ( 5 ) . The course SSc variable . In patient disease remain confined sclerodactyly Raynaud 's phenomenon . In patient relentless progression internal organ fibrosis , ultimately leading death . A recent study show cumulative 5-year survival rate 63 % . There effort try identify clinical investigational predictor outcome SSc . One study identify three clinical variable : raise ESR , proteinuria impair lung function index associate poor outcome . In addition , various hallmark autoantibody occur SSc mutually exclusive several study Europe North America demonstrate individual carry autoantibody associate different frequency internal organ complication . This also allow patient increase risk pulmonary , cardiac renal complication identify . At present , treatment definitely show effective SSc . Because presumed immunologic pathogenesis , modulation immune system major goal therapeutic intervention SSc . Several study report effectiveness immune modulate drug treatment disease , although mostly open , uncontrolled trial . These drug include azathioprine , cyclosporin , methotrexate cyclophosphamide . Amongst , methotrexate cyclophosphamide currently widely use . New , specific immunological treatment modality harness order improve treatment prognosis scleroderma patient . In 2005 , patient systemic sclerosis treat AIMSPRO compassionate basis sustain improvement mobility , particular , improvement proximal muscle power skin characteristic . In study , twenty patient receive either AIMSPRO placebo , 1.0ml subcutaneously , twice weekly 26 week . Standard outcome measure novel biomarkers use investigate safety , efficacy response treatment .</detailed_description>
