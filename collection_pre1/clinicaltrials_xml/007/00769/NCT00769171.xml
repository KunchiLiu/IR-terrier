	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety efficacy intravenous administration Moxifloxacin ( BAY 12-8039 ) compare intravenous ceftriaxone metronidazole treatment patient complicate intra abdominal infection . In view fact intra abdominal infection typically polymicrobial often treat empirically , select antibacterial agent must cover likely spectrum bacterial pathogen . Combination antibiotic therapy widely use great success .</brief_summary>
