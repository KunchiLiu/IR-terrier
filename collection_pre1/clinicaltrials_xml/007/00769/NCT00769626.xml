	<brief_title>Standardizing Management Patients With Low Back Pain Primary Care Physical Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Institute Medicine recognize low back pain ( LBP ) top 15 priority condition , call health care organization develop new , evidence-based management strategy . Most patient acute LBP manage primary care . Primary care management characterize high variability decision-making , include referral specialty physical therapy . In face variability surprise outcome management patient acute LBP also inconsistent , considerable proportion go persistent recurrent symptom . Costs associate patient fail recover quickly completely substantial . Many patient acute LBP refer primary care physical therapy . Physical therapy management patient acute LBP also highly variable term intervention use outcomes achieve . More effective standardized management patient acute LBP could impact progression condition concern associate chronic pain become evident , therefore central reduce cost improve outcome . Numerous practice guideline develop attempt reduce variability improve outcome patient acute LBP manage primary care . Current guideline provide little direction determine optimal type patient time referral physical therapy , broad recommendation delay referral least week . Within physical therapy absence validate decision-support tool reduce inappropriate variation care improve outcomes . The Investigators develop validated clinical decision rule identify subgroup patient LBP likely experience rapid sustain improvement brief , standardized physical therapy intervention deliver early course care , suggest may cost-effective manage subgroup early referral physical therapy . The impact integrate rule routine clinical care assess . We conduct randomized clinical trial examine outcome cost associate integrate decision rule primary care management patient LBP . Patients LBP fit decision rule criterion randomize one two group ; one manage usual care base current practice guideline ; manage base decision rule early , standardized physical therapy . Patients follow 6 month . Outcomes include measure disability , pain , satisfaction , cost .</detailed_description>
