	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether combination treatment prostate cancer IMC-A12 ( antibody block insulin-like growth factor receptor activity ) hormonal therapy ( testosterone lower ) prostatectomy , effective prior result hormonal therapy alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Androgen deprivation long principal mean control advanced prostate cancer , cure disease patient ultimately progress tumor eliminate definitive local therapy . Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation prior radical prostatectomy downstage localize disease reduce likelihood residual disease margin , improve failure free survival . It demonstrate despite androgen deprivation luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonists orchiectomy , prostate tissue prostate cancer maintain level androgens adequate continue stimulate androgen receptor downstream signal . These level androgen may continue allow survival tumor cell induction resistance overexpression receptor . The anti-insulin-like growth factor type I receptor ( IGF-IR ) antibody IMC-A12 block translocation androgen receptor nucleus , dramatically augment efficacy androgen deprivation human prostate xenograft model . The combination androgen deprivation IMC-A12 anticipate effectively treat cancer within prostate , optimize local control , potentially eliminate micrometastatic disease . We propose test hypothesis phase II study , administer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy IMC-A12 prior radical prostatectomy patient clinically localize , high risk prostate cancer 3 month . Patients clinically localize , surgically resectable ( cT1-T3 ) prostate cancer , high risk relapse candidate radical prostatectomy treat LHRH agonist androgen receptor antagonist combine IMC-A12 , 10 mg/kg give intravenously every 14 day 12 week . Patients undergo biopsy prostate prior treatment radical prostatectomy 12 week initiation treatment . The primary endpoint study evaluate ability LHRH agonist IMC-A12 induce complete pathologic remission Samples current study compare control , untreated prostatectomy specimens Northwest Prostate SPORE Tissue Core concurrent set specimens patient treat 12 week combine androgen deprivation .</detailed_description>
