	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Children bear prematurely ( 8 9 month ) brain damage abnormal appearance optic nerve ( nerve eye ) resemble glaucoma ( cup ) compare born 8 month . Purpose : see often child bear prematurely suffer brain damage , abnormal appearance optic nerve ( nerve eye ) mimic glaucoma ( cup ) . This optic nerve cup often see child born 8 month rarely see child born 8 month . Children born prematurely know injury brain yet fully develop . This often involve part brain involve vision . Clinicians observed child abnormal appearance optic nerve ( nerve eye ) , appearance glaucoma . These child often undergo extensive often unnecessary invasive test rule glaucoma . The investigator wish establish prevalence abnormality child subject unnecessary investigation . The investigator also want understand optic nerve cupping ( similar clinical picture glaucoma ) relate approximate timing extent brain injury , type cerebral palsy motor disability child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study provide prevalence data occurrence optic nerve head cup child static encephalopathy much large cohort previously report literature ( large cohort literature n=35 ) . Children large optic nerve cup treat `` glaucoma suspect '' . A routine glaucoma work-up child include examination anesthesia sedation , since child unable co-operate stay still accurate intraocular pressure measurement . These procedure often periodically repeated major financial burden . Importantly , also carry substantial health risk , especially premature neonate need ICU monitoring anesthesia procedure . Roughly half child undergo examination anesthesia suspicion glaucoma find disease . Children diagnosis static encephalopathy attend Pediatric Neurology clinic recruit . Interested patient undergo routine dilate eye examination obtain consent assent . The optic nerve head parameter ( size , shape , color , cup-disc ratio , vessel tortuosity ) record 2 ophthalmologist experience evaluation optic nerve . Some child ( physically able sit chair look straight ahead without blink ) offer disc photograph . This one-time examination do routine clinic visit . The prevalence optic disc cupping ( â‰¥ 0.5 ) population child static encephalopathy onset 24-36 week obtain . Comparison cup/disc ratio 2 group child base approximate timing neurological insult also do . The result study may allow pediatric ophthalmologist glaucoma specialist spare child static encephalopathy isolate optic nerve head cup extensive , risky expensive glaucoma work-up . This study also provide information patho-physiology develop visual nervous system .</detailed_description>
