	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn image change induce new therapeutic agent , bevacizumab standard steroid , dexamethasone patient high grade glioma . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use evaluate difference 2 treatment . The usual contrast agent ( gadolinium ) iron contain contrast agent call `` ferumoxytol '' may help u evaluate difference bevacizumab dexamethasone effect image brain tumor call high grade glioma . For purpose , intravenous contrast agent injection , special MR scan ( call : dynamic perfusion , blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) permeability measurement ) perform see microvascular change brain tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Dynamic Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) Imaging Patients With Recurrent High Grade Glioma Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult patient ( &gt; 18 year old ) recurrent high grade glioma ( confirmed radiology tissue sample ) , progress prior temozolomide + radiation therapy , recruit neurology , neurosurgery , neuro-oncology clinic . Patients enrol meet study inclusion exclusion criterion Patients scan four different time-points ( 4 MRI series ) ( 1 ) begin treatment ( base line ) , ( 2 ) Three week first treatment , ( 3 ) Three week second treatment , ( 4 ) time progression disease . Each MRI time-point consist series MRI 's three consecutive day . On first day , gadolinium ( 0.1 mmol/kg ) inject MRI scan . On follow day ferumoxytol ( 2 mg/kg ) third day , MRI scan do without additional contrast agent , see delay contrast enhancement ferumoxytol . Subjects treatment include chemotherapeutic agent call carboplatin combine either bevacizumab dexamethasone ; 6 patient receive carboplatin-bevacizumab , follow carboplatin-dexamethasone , another 6 patient receive carboplatin- dexamethasone , follow carboplatin-bevacizumab . After 3rd time-point , patient continue carboplatin-bevacizumab treatment ( currently FDA approve combination brain tumor , however widely use throughout country ) .There monthly clinical visit clinical MRI progression disease . There follow visit , 1 month last ferumoxytol injection .</detailed_description>
