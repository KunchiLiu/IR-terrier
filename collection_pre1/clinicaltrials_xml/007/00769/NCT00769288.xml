	<brief_title>FAU Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability FAU patient advance solid tumor lymphoma . II . To determine dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) FAU patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe clinical response patient treat FAU . II . To characterize pharmacokinetics FAU patient . III . To explore whether association exist pre-treatment 18F-FAU PET standardize uptake value level time tumor progression treatment unlabeled FAU . IV . To estimate protein level thymidylate synthase ( TS ) archival tumor tissue sample compare thymidine kinase ( TK ) TS protein level TK TS mRNA level fresh tumor tissue sample patient treat MTD . V. To explore relationship genetic polymorphism TS tumor 18F-FAU uptake . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive FAU IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
