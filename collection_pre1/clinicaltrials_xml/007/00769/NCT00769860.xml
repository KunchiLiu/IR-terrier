	<detailed_description>IBM chronic disorder muscle become inflamed ( swell ) cause muscle weakening . The cause unknown . There new evidence suggest pathology IBM result cellular change induce variety stressful event disease . In response stressful event body 's normal response increase level Heat Shock Proteins ( HSP ) help counteract stop cellular change . In people IBM increase appear sufficient enough reverse toxic cellular change . Arimoclomol cause body make HSP protein . By increase HSP level IBM patient hope reverse toxic cellular change might responsible pathology IBM .</detailed_description>
