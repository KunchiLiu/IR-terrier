	<brief_title>The Effect Simvastatin Therapy Expression Procoagulant Inflammatory Markers Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure significant public health problem United States . There five million heart failure patient America number grow 550,000 new case year.1 Heart failure primary diagnosis nearly one million hospital admission year another two million patient admitted secondary diagnosis heart failure , make single large expense Medicare.1 Furthermore , heart failure cause contribute 300,000 death year , spite advance treatment , 70-80 % patient heart failure die within 8 years.1 , 2 Therefore , heart failure one , important socioeconomic health problem 21st century . Heart failure patient increase risk thromboembolic event . Autopsy result heart failure patient report 50 % 60 % incidence thromboembolic events.3-5 Besides know thromboembolic risk factor associate heart failure state ( blood stasis poorly contract leave ventricle , endothelial dysfunction neuroendocrine activation ) , elevate TF expression may also contribute enhance thromboembolic risk . Recent evidence laboratory show functional TF procoagulant activity ( TF-PCA ) monocytes increase significantly 2.8-fold heart failure patient ( n=48 ) compare healthy control ( n=25 ) ( p=0.03 ) ( Figure 1 ) , natural inhibitor tissue factor pathway inhibitor ( TFPI ) show significant difference.6 The heart failure subject subsequently follow death , transplant , clinical event ( i.e . heart failure hospitalization , arrhythmia , acute coronary event , thromboembolic event , death cardiac transplant ) . When TF-PCA value divide median , upper 50-percentile demonstrate trend toward increase mortality ( p=0.06 ) significant increase clinical event ( p=0.04 ) compare low 50-percentile ( Figure 2 ) . Elevated TF expression believe play integral role intravascular coagulation see coronary artery disease.7-9 Human atherosclerotic plaque highly thrombogenic , exhibit high level TF antigen functional TF procoagulant activity.10-15 In addition , TF antigen high plaque patient myocardial infarction unstable angina stable angina.15 Recent evidence also show local TF inhibition TFPI decrease thrombogenicity disrupt human atherosclerotic plaques.16 These data support increase TF expression may mediate increase risk thromboembolic event . Simvastatin , antilipidemic agent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor type , show decrease monocyte TF expression vitro ex vivo.17-20 In monocyte collect healthy volunteer hyperlipidemic patient stimulate LPS ( potent inducer TF ) vitro , simvastatin inhibits monocyte TF expression dose-dependent manner.17 In vivo model , hyperlipidemic patient receive simvastatin exhibit significant decrease TF-Ag TF-PCA baseline ( mean reduction 68 % 61 % , respectively ) , TF parameter remain unchanged placebo group ( p=0.0002 ) .18 Whether simvastatin also decrease TF expression heart failure unknown . Clinical study simvastatin statin mostly confine lipid-lowering effect . However , evidence also suggest improve outcome heart failure . In post-hoc analysis Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study ( 4S ) , simvastatin 20-40 mg daily patient coronary heart disease significantly reduce occurrence heart failure ( relative risk reduction 21.7 % , p &lt; 0.015 ) heart failure mortality ( relative risk reduction 37 % , p=0.014 ) .21 Simvastatin also show non-significant trend decrease heart failure hospitalization . An analysis data PRAISE trial show 62 % decrease risk death patient treat statin , independent on-treatment cholesterol levels.22 The OMPTIMAAL trial also show improvement survival heart failure patient statin therapy.23 In cohort study Horwich et al , statin use associate reduction risk heart transplant death , without regard cholesterol levels.24 These result suggest treatment HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor beneficial effect , beyond would expect ability alter plasma lipid level . Two distinct common allele tissue factor gene , designate - 1208 D - 1208 I , identified.25 The two haplotype roughly equal frequency sample 2354 individuals.25 There conflict data effect alleles TF expression , one study show lower plasma TF decrease risk venous thrombosis - 1208 D haplotype present.25 Other study show presence - 1208 D haplotype result higher cellular expression TF.26 , 27 The effect polymorphisms efficacy statin lower TF unknown , clinical impact heart failure . A number pro-inflammatory cytokine elevate heart failure . Evidence laboratory show Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) level 75 pg/mL NYHA class II-IV heart failure patient , compare 0.4 pg/mL healthy volunteer ( p=0.002 ) .28 Others find similar elevation show elevated IL-6 concentration independent predictor worsen heart failure adverse events.29-34 Statins show decrease expression IL-6 vitro , coronary artery disease patient diabetes.35-40 Other inflammatory cytokine , IL-1/10 ratio tissue necrosis factor ( TNF ) , also implicate procoagulant state potential target statin therapy.29 , 31 , 33 What effect statins elevation IL-6 cytokine heart failure impact reduction statins outcomes unknown . Our propose research examine whether treatment simvastatin alters expression activity monocyte TF , whether polymorphisms TF gene alter therapeutic effect effect treatment inflammatory marker heart failure . The result study may assist tailor statin therapy specific characteristic , inflammatory state , heart failure patient . If treatment simvastatin significantly lower TF expression , may reduce risk thromboembolic event patient heart failure , thus reduce mortality morbidity . If treatment effect varies base TF genotype , may define identifiable population statin therapy may beneficial population whole .</detailed_description>
