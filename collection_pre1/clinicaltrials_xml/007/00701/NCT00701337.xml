	<brief_summary>The aim pilot study conduct post-menopausal woman evaluate effect 17ß-estradiol administration inflammatory-immune cell , namely antigen-presenting cell ( monocytes/dendritic cell ) , precisely activation inflammatory stimulus . This study allow u determine ability recruit menopausal woman characterize optimal primary end-point among numerous criterion test</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect 17ß-estradiol Inflammatory-immune Responses Post-menopausal Women According Administration Route</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although beneficial effect hormonal replacement therapy ( HRT ) osteoporosis climacteric symptom clearly establish , randomize study recently reveal combined administration oral estrogens medroxyprogesterone acetate increase incidence coronary event stroke first month treatment . Furthermore , oral estrogen significantly enhance IL-6 CRP secretion . This increase plasma concentration inflammatory marker probably result direct effect oral administration liver , since twas observe estrogen administer transdermal route . Our experimental data ovariectomized mice demonstrate chronic subcutaneous administration of17ß-estradiol ( E2 ) enhance expression pro-inflammatory cytokine Th1 lymphocytes , Natural Killer T cell monocytes/macrophages . This pro-inflammatory effect E2 could play role deleterious vascular effect observe randomized study , especially favor plaque instability . Our aim determine whether E2 administration menopausal woman lead inflammatory phenotype circulate antigen-presenting cell , especially monocytes . Indeed , evaluate inflammatory status cellular level probably give precise information plasma cytokine concentration predict ability estrogen enhance inflammatory process . We first propose pilot study order determine enrollment feasibility , well optimal biological endpoint assess monocyte activation status . These latter criterion use future randomize study compare two route E2 administration ( oral v transdermal ) . The present study include 34 menopausal woman . After inclusion visit , three visit perform collection 50 ml blood sample isolation circulate immune cell ( monocyte ) . The following criterion study ( V1 V2 ) 30 ± 3 day E2 treatment ( V3 : 1. expression surface activation molecule . 2 . Secretion cytokines response several Toll-like receptor stimulus . 3 . IL-6 CRP-US plasma concentration . We first assess intra-individual variability ( V1 V2 ) . At visit 2 ( V2 ) , subject randomize receive E2 either oral ( n= 17 ) transdermal ( n= 17 ) route .</detailed_description>
