	<brief_summary>Generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) common disorder geriatric population prevalence rate reach 7 % even high rate 8 % among elderly veteran . However , despite high prevalence treat clinician presently force address treatment issue population without guidance scientific data . This proposal aim begin address void . In light emerge information regard efficacy new anti anxiety agent , specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , treatment young adult GAD patient time prospectively evaluate safety efficacy medication treatment elderly GAD patient .

	<detailed_description>Generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) serious distinct illness occur significant number , affect least 7 million people United States alone . The prevalence GAD high primary care set rate twice high rate report community sample . GAD life-long disorder low remission rate , result high disability morbidity . Of significance emerge epidemiological data suggest GAD highly prevalent geriatric population prevalence rate range 1.9 % 7.1 % accounting majority anxiety disorder case age group . More alarming fact presence anxiety symptom lead considerable functional impairment , increased morbidity , mortality among affected elderly population , thus leading increase cost care . However , despite advance make GAD treatment adult population , prospective data presently available treatment GAD elderly population , force clinician provide treatment without guidance scientific data . These finding particular relevance Veterans Affairs Health Care System average age patient treat primary care clinic currently 60-64 year . The present application focus target subpopulation elderly veteran . This proposal aim provide evidence-based guideline pharmacological management elderly veteran suffer generalized anxiety disorder . This accomplish conduct clinical trial elderly veteran suffer GAD evaluate efficacy safety sertraline - proven anxiolytic compound widely use young adult population . We believe propose study one first study area . Thus , may also serve first step future line research aim develop comprehensive pharmacological psychosocial intervention treatment anxiety elderly . ( b ) HYPOTHESIS/RESEARCH QUESTIONS Study Hypothesis In double-blind , placebo-controlled trial elderly veteran diagnose GAD , sertraline effective equally safe placebo reduce symptom generalize anxiety disorder . Research Question Will presence difference pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ( i.e. , mean population value steady state plasma concentration ) plasma level sertraline explain difference efficacy side effect profile within two fixed sertraline dos study , detect ? ( c ) SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE The objective propose study conduct multi-site , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial evaluate efficacy safety sertraline fix dos vs. placebo treatment GAD among elderly primary care outpatient veteran .</detailed_description>
