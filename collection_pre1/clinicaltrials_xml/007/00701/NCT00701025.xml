	<brief_summary>The term exercise-induced bronchospasm ( EIB ) describe acute , transient airway narrow occurs , often , exercise . Manifestations EIB range mild impairment performance severe bronchospasm respiratory failure . The pathogenesis EIB remain controversial role airway inflammation yet definitively characterize . We plan compare marker inflammation asthmatic participant without EIB baseline bronchoprovocation eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation test ( EVH ) . We also collect demographic information well information asthma control exercise habit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At Visit 1 , participant complete questionnaire demographic , asthma control ( asthmatic ) exercise habit . The participant baseline spirometry perform , skin prick test allergy . Skin test important influence level exhale nitric oxide hence would like adjust result presence allergy . Subsequently , volunteer undergo sputum induction peripheral blood drawn microRNA analysis . MicroRNA 's single-stranded RNA molecules 21-23 nucleotide length regulate gene expression . Patterns MicroRNA expression link heart disease cancer . Similar pattern identify exercise-induced asthma . In total , include time question recovery , time Visit 1 approximately 3 hour . At Visit 2 , occur 24 hour 7 day Visit 1 order minimize risk asthma exacerbation , participant baseline spirometry . Baseline exhale nitric oxide perform . Eucapnic Voluntary hyperventilation test perform . They second exhaled nitric oxide quantification , undergo sputum induction peripheral blood drawn microRNA analysis , occur EVH test . In total , include time question recovery , time Visit 2 approximately 2 hour .</detailed_description>
