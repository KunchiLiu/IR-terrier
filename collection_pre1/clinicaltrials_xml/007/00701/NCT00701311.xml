In Chronic Prostatitis ( CP ) Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome ( CPPS ) , men low urinary tract symptom , pelvic pain , sexual dysfunction decrease quality life . Little known cause CP/CPPS . Likewise , definitive therapy exist CP/CPPS . Unlike bacterial prostatitis , clear infect organism determine , CP/CPPS always treat antibiotic . Due significant inflammatory nature CP/CPPS , prior therapy focus target inflammation . CC-10004 several study show inhibitor inflammatory mediator , may decrease pain experienced CP/CPPS .</detailed_description>
