	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare people disease ( sarcoidosis ) without disease . We want see people sarcoidosis different immune response people without disease . The goal study see nicotine patch anti-inflammatory treatment sarcoidosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Nicotine Patches Patients With Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until recently , good explanation fact smoke cigarette actually reduces risk sarcoidosis . Research study show nicotine , common component cigarette smoke , strongly suppress immune system reduces type inflammation characteristic sarcoidosis lung . We propose nicotine treatment , administer form skin patch , reduce severity lung disease patient sarcoidosis . Sarcoidosis patient volunteer participate study submit standardize questionnaire relate quality life severity shortness breath treatment . We also compare objective measure lung function , radiographic parameter , severity lung inflammation . We predict nicotine treatment reduce severity sarcoidosis symptom , improve lung function , resolve lung inflammation . If hypothesis proven correct relatively small group patient , perform additional study large group patient consider feature sarcoidosis patient predict favorable response nicotine nicotine-like drug . If nicotine ultimately found effective treatment sarcoidosis , may replace exist treatment frequently ineffective unacceptable side-effects .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Symptomatic ( active ) granulomatous lung disease ( radiographic stage II III disease ) least 6 month diagnosis . This select patient chronically active variant sarcoidosis likely require longterm treatment ( 33 ) . • Active smoker , Previous splenectomy , Those require highdose immunosuppression [ i.e. , ≥ 0.2 mg/kg/day prednisone ( equivalent ) &gt; 10 mg/week methotrexate require second line cytolytic agent ( e.g. , cyclophosphamide , azathioprine ) antiTNF treatment ( e.g. , thalidomide , antiTNF antibody , etc . ) ] control disease activity . We also exclude patient high risk complication relate use nicotine . This include patient know intolerance nicotine active cardiac central nervous system disease high risk cardiac arrhythmia seizure . We also exclude patient extensive pulmonary fibrosis base upon lung biopsy high resolution CT scan criterion</criteria>
