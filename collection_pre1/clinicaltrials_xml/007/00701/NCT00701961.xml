	<detailed_description>Malaria pregnancy constitute major public health problem Sub-Saharan Africa , increase risk low birth weight ( &lt; 2500g ) , infant mortality , infant morbidity first year life , prematurity infant anemia . Over past decade , P. falciparum show increase resistance standard antimalarial therapy ( chloroquine CQ Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine ) . The inexorable development spread P. falciparum resistance antimalarial prompt change treatment approach ; artemisinin contain combination therapy ( ACTs ) standard treatment P. falciparum malaria area establish resistance traditional therapy . The use combination reduce theoretical likelihood select resistant mutant ; hop strategy delay development new resistance . A standard approach use ACT pregnancy exist Africa . Even World Health Organization endorse use ACTs treatment uncomplicated malaria 2nd 3rd trimester pregnancy , country keep use quinine , others allow use ACTs . These different approach point necessity establish safety efficacy ACTs malaria-infected pregnant woman . Nevertheless , consider pharmacokinetic antimalarial may alter pregnancy ( potentially lead under-dosing ) available safety pharmacokinetic data still somewhat limited , important carry preliminary pharmacokinetic study confirm disprove available data ( collect South-East Asia ) , start large African efficacy safety trial . The ACT regimen mefloquine-artesunate ( MQ-AS ) recently develop fixed-dose combination Drugs Neglected Diseases Initiative ( DNDi ) register Brazil ( country manufacture ) 2008 . Artesunate artemisinin derivative rapidly increase positive experience pregnancy , Mefloquine ( LariamÂ® ) use many year prevention treatment malaria , show safe pregnant woman . The convenient dose afford fix drug combination make MQ-AS promise candidate use treat pregnant woman Africa , rescue treatment alternative quinine . Since preliminary data suggest peak concentration mefloquine lower pregnant woman , study safety , efficacy , dose optimization imperative , prior wide-spread adoption medicine . Therefore , propose compare pharmacokinetics fix combination MQ-AS treatment P.falciparum 24 pregnant woman second third trimester pharmacokinetics regimen 24 match non-pregnant P.falciparum infect woman , African setting . This allow dose optimization pregnant woman .</detailed_description>
