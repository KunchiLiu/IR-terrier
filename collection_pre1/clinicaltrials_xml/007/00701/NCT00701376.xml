	<detailed_description>Before day surgery liver function determine use DDG-2001 Analyzer . This monitor able detect concentration dye call indocyanine green dye ( ICG ) present blood stream . A dose 0.5 mg/kg ICG inject IV arm . Over approximately fifteen minute DDG-2001 Analyzer determine quickly liver remove dye ICG blood stream . This value represent well liver function . Blood sample draw injection ICG measure liver function use standard liver function test . This routine injecting ICG obtain blood routine liver function test happen one time , surgery , subject lose significant amount original weight ( 60 % excess weight ) . This amount weight loss typically occur 12 18 month gastric bypass surgery . This second ICG measurement occur outpatient follow-up visit CCF . A biopsy take liver surgery . A second biopsy take 60 % weight loss compare determine effect surgery liver .</detailed_description>
