	<brief_title>Coronary Arteriosclerosis Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Stroke myocardial infarction lead cause death disability industrialize country . Multiple interaction exist various form cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease several risk factor development stroke major cardiovascular disease similar , emphasized recent publication common set guideline primary prevention . Following myocardial infarction stroke incidence markedly increase , particular early myocardial infarction . Additionally , non-stroke cardiovascular disease , especially coronary artery disease , main cause long-term mortality patient survive cerebrovascular disease . The history ischemic heart disease stroke patient often unreliable cognitive language impairment simply ischemic heart disease asymptomatic . For least 25 year myocardial damage repeatedly propose consequence acute stroke , i.e . neuromediated . Most prior study perform patient subarachnoid hemorrhage , consequently limit data regard ischemic stroke , common cerebrovascular ailment , available . Recently demonstrate highly sensitive specific marker detection myocardial necrosis , i.e. , cardiac troponins , may elevate 0 % - 34 % patient ischemic stroke . However , majority study conduct sufficiently evaluate coexist coronary artery disease . The neuromediated theory support patient subarachnoid hemorrhage elevate troponin level due lack significant obstructive coronary artery disease evaluate coronary angiogram . Little known conceivable cause-effect relationship acute ischemic stroke myocardial necrosis , i.e. , neuromediation , elevate level troponin cause direct cardiac damage , i.e. , AMI . Recently , several report demonstrate level natriuretic peptide increase patient acute ischemic stroke . The hormone Brain Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) split product ( NT-proBNP ) derive predominantly myocardium process response stretch cardiomyocytes hemodynamic stress . The mechanism elevate level NT-proBNP set acute ischemic stroke unknown . Myocardial ischemia know cause release NT-proBNP . Accordingly , level NT-proBNP high acute ischemic stroke patient ST-segment depression 12-lead ECG without . However , unknown whether level NT-proBNP correlate coronary arteriosclerosis leave ventricle function patient acute ischemic stroke . The current gold standard detection atherosclerotic coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , invasive coronary angiography ( CAG ) , allow direct visualization coronary artery lumen . Inconvenience patient small negligible risk complication relate CAG prompt intensive search alternative , reliable non-invasive mean coronary artery visualisation . Standard non-invasive method stress test lack sufficient sensitivity detect significant CAD . Over last decade multislice compute tomography ( MSCT ) emerge promising non-invasive method assessment CAD . Previous study convincingly demonstrate high negative predictive value MSCT coronary angiography ( CTA ) CAG reference . Thus , normal CTA seem allow clinician rule presence hemodynamic relevant coronary artery stenosis high degree reliability . In addition detect significant coronary artery stenosis , recent focus visualise characterise coronary artery plaque . Both necropsy coronary intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) study show `` normal '' vessel CAG may fact contain significant amount atherosclerotic plaque . Independent degree coronary artery stenosis , plaque may increase risk erosion rupture . The latter , unstable plaque think trigger acute coronary ischemic event . Accordingly , release troponins , NT-proBNP ECG change observe patient could due CAD . So far serial investigation CAD never perform patient acute ischemic stroke . Objective : The specific objective thesis cohort patient acute ischemic stroke , 1 . To establish degree coronary arteriosclerosis . 2 . To describe left ventricular systolic diastolic function relation change NT-proBNP . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Age ≥ 18 year old 2 . Symptoms suggestive acute ischemic stroke 3 .

Lack cooperation Clinical evaluation : All patient include study compute tomography scan perform time admission . The patient include undergo baseline clinical evaluation , structure interview examination medical record focus - Hypertension - Dyslipidemia - Diabetes mellitus - Smoking - Alcohol consumption - Medication - Atrial fibrillation - Ischemic heart disease - Angina Pectoris ( CCS classification ) - Heart failure ( NYHA- KILLIP-classification ) - Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease Electrocardiography : A 12-lead resting ECG obtain immediately admission follow five day morning . The 12-lead resting ECGs record supine position paper speed 25 mm/s . All ECGs interpret two experienced cardiologist blind condition . The ECG finding interest thesis horizontal downsloping ST-segment depression ≥0.1 mV , T-wave inversion ≥0.1 mV two contiguous lead , ST-segment elevation ≥0.2 mV lead V1-3 ; ST-elevation ≥0.1 mV lead . Holter monitoring : Holter 24-hour ECG recording perform Reynolds Medical Tracker 3 Pathfinder 700 ( Reynolds Medical Limited , England ) analysis . An ischemic episode define ≥0.1 mV horizontal downsloping ST-segment depression compare baseline , measure 80 ms J-point . An episode ST-segment depression last ≥2 minute order count two episode separate least two minute . In patient rest ST-segment depression additional ≥0.1 mV ST-segment depression present . Every episode ST-segment deviation verify ECG printout ( 25 mm/s ) . Furthermore , Holter monitor analyzed occurrence atrial arrhythmia . Evaluation ischemic arrhythmia episode interpret visually two cardiologist blind patient characteristic . Blood Sampling : Blood sample draw immediately admission follow five day morning . Specimens NT-proBNP , troponin T I , CK-MB , myeloperoxidase , oxidate low-density lipoprotein , osteoprotegerin collect . All analysis perform Department Clinical Biochemistry , Vejle Hospital . Echocardiography : Doppler echocardiography perform soon patient condition allows . Examinations perform GE medical Vivid 7 ultrasound machine . Images obtain parasternal apical window . M-mode recording do parasternal long-axis view . Pulsed Doppler measurement mitral inflow obtain transducer apical four-chamber view , 1-2 mm Doppler sample volume place tip mitral leaflet diastole . Tissue Doppler image mitral annulus obtain apical 4-chamber view 1.5-mm sample volume place medial mitral annulus . All Doppler echocardiographic examination do horizontal sweep set 100 mm/s . At least 3-5 cardiac cycle measure . Finally color cod real time tissue Doppler image acquire apical window . - End-systolic , end-diastolic volume ejection fraction calculate accord Simpson modify biplane method . - LV mass estimate use recommendation American Society Echocardiography . - Maximal left atrial volume measure end-systole use two orthogonal apical view . - From pulse wave mitral inflow signal , peak E wave velocity , peak A wave velocity , mitral E-wave deceleration time measure .
