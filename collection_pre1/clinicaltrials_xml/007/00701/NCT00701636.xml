	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Daptomycin During Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiothoracic surgery commonly perform procedure United States . Many site previously use cefazolin , antibiotic , standard prophylaxis prevent surgical site infection . However , give bacteria cause surgical site infection resistant cefazolin , center use vancomycin , alternative antibiotic , surgical antibiotic prophylaxis . However , patient take vancomycin , well study alternative vancomycin surgical prophylaxis . Therefore , study daptomycin , new United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved antibiotic , prophylaxis surgical site infection among patient undergo cardiothoracic bypass ( CPB ) coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) . Our study power see daptomycin effective vancomycin prevent surgical site infection . Instead , purpose study validate adequate level antibiotic present patient ' blood cardiothoracic bypass surgery . Study subject intervention group follow time enrollment study discharge hospital , 7 day follow administration daptomycin , whichever come first . The first 15 subject enrol receive intervention drug daptomycin surgical antibiotic prophylaxis follow 15 subject enrol matched control receive standard care surgical prophylaxis per patient 's treating physician . The control undergo monitor safety outcomes patient receive daptomycin undergo . Subjects enrol intervention group receive single intravenous administration daptomycin 8 milligram ( mg ) /kilogram ( kg ) 30-60 minute prior surgery ( incision ) . Blood sample draw Research Coordinator . A total 85 ( milliliter ) mL blood collect study . A total 14 blood sample collect : 4 sample Pre-CPB phase , 4 sample CPB procedure , 6 sample Post-CPB . Total plasma daptomycin concentration determine utilizing standard high-performance liquid chromatography technique . Plasma concentration compare minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC90 ) common pathogen involve surgical site infection , specifically Staphylococcus aureus coagulase negative Staphylococcus .</detailed_description>
