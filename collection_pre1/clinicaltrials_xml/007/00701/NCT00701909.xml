	<detailed_description>An open wound care procedure cause pain sometimes use medication morphine alone adequately help alleviate pain procedure . This study do learn administration another medication name ketamine vein addition morphine effective alleviate pain wound cleanse procedure administration morphine alone . Patients eligible study 21 year old , open surgical traumatic wound duration 10 day , wound pain intensity score 3 scale 0 10 0 pain 10 bad pain imaginable previous wound care procedure , intravenous access . A total 50 patient characteristic expect take part study . Patients agree take part study , one day , receive receive injection via vein morphine 0.05 mg per kilogram weight ( maximum dose 4 mg ) another ketamine 0.25 mg per kilogram weight prior receive wound care procedure , day , receive injection via vein morphine 0.1 mg per kilogram weight ( maximum dose 8 mg ) another saline prior receive wound care procedure . They able know receive ketamine saline first time second time . Ketamine drug approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) anesthesia approve provide analgesia ( relieve pain ) . However , small dos ketamine use ( indication ) clinical area provide analgesia , analgesic property study many researcher . Before wound care procedure subject ask rate wound pain intensity rest moment past 24 hour ( include `` bad '' `` average '' pain ) , overall pain intensity rest moment `` bad '' `` average '' past 24 hour use 0 10 scale 0 pain 10 bad pain imaginable . They give list common word might describe pain , body outline indicate pain . In addition , ask rate level sleepiness use 0 10 scale 0 sleepy 10 extremely sleepy . After remove outer dressing , patient test pain sensitivity around wound thin , short length plastic ( like little straw ) , press skin outside wound towards wound ask report distinct change perception . The first point `` painful '' , `` sore '' , `` sharper '' feeling occur mark skin measure distance mark wound . If change perception occur , stimulation stop 0.5 cm wound . This measure experimental . Immediately wound care procedure follow measure : ( 1 ) `` bad '' wound pain intensity experience wound care procedure , ( 2 ) description pain quality wound care procedure , ( 3 ) level sleepiness , ( 4 ) side effect unpleasant sensation measure use 0 10 scale , 0 mean unpleasant sensation 10 mean extremely unpleasant sensation , finally ( 5 ) pain sensitivity around wound use thin , short length plastic . The length time need take part study depend long wound care procedure take . The time could approximately 45 minute 60 minute ( 1 hour ) per visit 90 minute ( 1½ hour ) 120 minute ( 2 hour ) total study 2 day need complete study .</detailed_description>
