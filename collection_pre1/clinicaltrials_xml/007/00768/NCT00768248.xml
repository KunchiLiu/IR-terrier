	<brief_title>Naval Medical Center San Diego ( NMCSD ) - Ambulatory Continuous Peripheral Nerve Blocks Treatment Post-Amputation Phantom Limb Stump Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To determine , compare current standard-of-care treatment , addition ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve block decrease post-amputation phantom limb stump pain . Hypothesis 1 : Following upper low extremity amputation , phantom limb and/or stump pain significantly decrease four week follow multiple-day ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve block compare patient receive standard-of-care treatment ( measure 11-point numeric rating scale ) . Specific Aim 2 : To investigate possible relationship addition multiple-day ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve block standard-of-care treatment post-amputation phantom limb and/or stump pain cortical reorganization . Hypothesis 2 : Following upper low extremity amputation subsequent phantom limb pain/sensation and/or stump pain , addition multiple-day ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve block standard-of-care treatment result cortical reorganization four-weeks follow perineural infusion ( measure MRI ) .</detailed_description>
