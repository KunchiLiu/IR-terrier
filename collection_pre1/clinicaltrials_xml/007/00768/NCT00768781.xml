	<brief_summary>The overall goal project evaluate evidence efficacy two mindfulness-based intervention , mindfulness-based therapy insomnia ( MBT-I ) mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , reduce arousal improve sleep among individual psychophysiological insomnia . Specific Aim 1 : To obtain evidence relative effect MBT-I MBSR compare delayed-treatment control condition follow behavior therapy insomnia ( BT-I ) arousal level . It hypothesize MBSR MBT-I superior control condition reduce arousal level . Specific Aim 2 : To obtain evidence relative effect MBT-I , MBSR , delayed-treatment control sleep . It hypothesize MBT-I superior MBSR control condition improve sleep parameter . Specific Aim 3 : To investigate relationship measure arousal ( self-report objective measure ) sleep ( self-report objective measure ) enhance understanding role arousal psychophysiological insomnia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The conceptual model study identifies two possible target treatment : arousal sleep . In model , BT insomnia directly target nighttime symptom insomnia ( BT pathway ) , improve sleep increase homeostatic drive sleep . Although BT hypothesize indirectly reduce arousal , study specifically investigated effect . In contrast , MBSR intervention hypothesize target arousal , preliminary finding suggest , also improve symptom insomnia ( MBSR pathway ) . It therefore hypothesize combination BT mindfulness superior treatment alone target nighttime symptom hyperarousal ( Mindfulness + BT pathway ) . Our preliminary data suggest combination treatment effect self-reported arousal sleep . Conceptually , novel approach would provide set self-regulating skill could potentially target broad range daytime nighttime symptom characteristic insomnia disorder . To test conceptual model , study employ randomized clinical trial design three condition : 1 ) Mindfulness-Based Therapy insomnia ( MBT-I ) , 2 ) mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , 3 ) delayed-treatment condition follow behavior therapy insomnia ( BT-I ) . Each three treatment deliver group format 8 weekly session span 8-week period .</detailed_description>
