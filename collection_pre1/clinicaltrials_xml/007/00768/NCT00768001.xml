	<brief_summary>Liver cancer lead cause cancer death worldwide . While molecular pathogenesis liver cancer extensively study , less known molecular biology liver cancer influence clinical outcome treatment response . We develop translational research program characterize molecular change liver cancer . We plan use molecular information obtain study liver tumor tissue develop new diagnostics treatment regimens patient cancer . The experimental approach require freeze fresh tumor tissue obtain surgical procedure , subsequently use analysis DNA , protein mRNA expression . Many patient liver cancer refer Stanford Liver Tumor Board consultation treatment recommendation . We propose gather tissue sample subsequently undergo biopsy , liver resection surgery , transplant surgery .</brief_summary>
