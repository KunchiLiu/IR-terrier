	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study BrainPort® Balance Device Peripheral Vestibular Dysfunction .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral vestibular dysfunction cause inner ear disorder , drug toxicity , neuritis , number cause . In absence fully functional vestibular system , brain often require retrain correctly utilize visual proprioceptive cue maintain postural stability . People vestibular dysfunction experience multiple problem posture control movement , include unsteady gait various balance-related difficulty . These effect make difficult walk dark uneven surface without risk fall . They typically refer conventional vestibular therapy . Many patient improve therapeutic intervention . Some patient reach plateau return previous level function . The BrainPort balance device transmits head position information via electrotactile stimulation tongue . With training , patient learn use positional information correct balance . Participants meet study criterion randomize perceived stimulation subliminal stimulation group . All participant give baseline assessment postural stability , balance , subjective well accord standardize test . After complete baseline assessment , participant train clinic use standard training protocol BrainPort balance device . Each participant participate 6 clinical training session , period 3 consecutive day . Upon completion clinic training session , participant continue 7½ week period home use . During period , participant train device 20 minute 2 time per day clinician contact participant weekly . At end home training period ( 8 week begin study ) , participant undergo test give baseline . Following data analysis , subject complete 8 week study originally assign group inferior result give opportunity use device show superior result data analysis .</detailed_description>

Unilateral Vestibular Hypofunction ( UVH ) —Bithermal caloric test result &gt; 25 % unilateral weakness . 2 . Minimum post 3 month diagnosis residual balance problem . 3 . Previously treat conventional physical therapy , discharge and/or reach plateau . 4 . Functional Ability : 1 . Able ambulate independently assistive device 20 foot . 2 . Ability stand independently 2 minute minimal upper extremity support . 3 . Dynamic Gait Index ≤ 19/24 . 5 . Able read sign inform consent form . 6 . Fluent English . 7 . Willing able complete testing , training , followup evaluation require study protocol . 1 . Current oral health problem determine health questionnaire examination oral cavity . 2 . Any medical condition would interfere performance assessment . 3 . Known neuropathy tongue . 4 . Prior exposure BrainPort balance device . 5 . History seizures epilepsy . 6 . If female , pregnant . Subject must deny pregnancy agree use appropriate birth control prevent pregnancy duration study . 7 . People implanted electrical medical device ( i.e . pacemaker , deep brain stimulator ) . 8 . People currently take vestibular suppressant medication ( i.e . barbiturate , benzodiazepine , betahistines cortisone ) . 9 . People previous diagnosis central nervous system lesion ( e.g . stroke brain injury ) . 10 . Current diagnosis following : 1 . Bilateral areflexia ( response ice water caloric test bilaterally ) 2 . Progressive neurological disease ( Multiple Sclerosis ) 3 . Cervicogenic dizziness 4 . Presyncope/syncope episodes 5 . Orthostatic hypotension 6 .
