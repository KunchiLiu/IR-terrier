	<brief_title>Sunitinib Recurrent Refractory Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Peritoneal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use two-stage design evaluate efficacy sunitinib base overall response ( OR ) define complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) . The null alternative OR rate 5 % 20 % . If one patient enrol stage one cohort ( n=17 patient ) achieve PR well accrual would proceed stage two ( n=18 patient ) . There 42 % probability stop trial stage one true OR rate 5 % . With 35 patient , design 85 % power detect 15 % difference OR rate assume 2-sided type I error rate 0.05 .</detailed_description>
