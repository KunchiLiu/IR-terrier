	<brief_title>The Characterization Small Bowel Colonic Involvement Patients With Seronegative Spondyloarthritides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Seronegative Spondyloarthritides ( SA ) group disorder share certain clinical feature association hla-b27 allele , also overlap feature inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Up 60 % patient inflammation colon ileum . This usually asymptomatic , 5 10 % patient SA , Frank IBD develop . Lesions bowel could also present SA patient potential injury pose NSAIDS , common use medication set . On hand , biologics use treat patient SA believe favorably influence small bowel lesion concomitantly present . It bowel involvement patient SA propose characterize , partly scant communicate data medical literature . The design propose study involve perform one full colonoscopic examination ( include ileoscopy ) follow one capsule endoscopy examination patient SA . Prior examination , patency gi tract test use patency capsule . If patency gi tract confirm , capsule endoscopy examination abandon . Our aim explore 100 patient three year , thus close-to-reality `` look '' presence extent bowel involvement pool patient SA ; also characterize lesion mainly depend treatment receive , concomitant pathology form disease . We also aim identify relationship lesion find colonoscopy capsule endoscopy , purpose possibility predict one perform . Thus , hope identify therapeutic strategy suit management patient .</detailed_description>
