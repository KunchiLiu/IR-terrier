	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) third common cause cancer-related death poor prognosis . Aim 1 : Efficacy Sorafenib combination TACE TACE establish therapy patient unresectable HCC show significantly improve survival patient compare treatment . Quite often cut blood supply hepatic artery , tumor induces active angiogenesis promote collateral blood vessel growth liver capsule artery collaterals gastroduodenal artery lead tumor recovery proliferation . Inhibition neoangiogenetic proliferation activity TACE multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib , already approve HCC , could lead significantly improvement tumor control survival patient advanced stage HCC.Safety compare historical TACE-only group placebo control TACE-trial . Aim 2 : Safety Sorafenib combination TACE : So far report safety Sorafenib combination TACE . Here evaluate safety tolerability combination 12 week last TACE . Aim 3 : PPG-Measurement : Development portal hypertension cirrhosis occurs due two main pathophysiologic mechanism : increase resistance portal blood flow result increase intrahepatic resistance decrease arteriolar vascular tone splanchnic vascular bed lead increase splanchnic inflow blood . Very recently , show increase splanchnic inflow result arteriolar vasodilation due excess NO-production splanchnic vascular bed also increase neoangiogenesis splanchnic circulation . Increased neovessel formation occur within day onset portal hypertension cirrhotic extrahepatic murine model portal hypertension . Neoangiogenesis effectively inhibit either antibody VEGF-R2 inhibitor VEGF-R2 autophosphorylation , result reduction splanchnic blood flow . Most recently , combination VEGF PDGF blocker decrease portal pressure experimental preclinical model . As Sorafenib VEGF PDGF blocker , aim analyze influence Sorafenib portal hypertension systemic hepatic hemodynamics . Aim 4 : Biomarkers treatment response : Furthermore , aim analyze methylated tumor DNA serum patient HCC undergo Sorafenib treatment TACE possible marker treatment response .</detailed_description>
