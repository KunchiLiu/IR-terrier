	<brief_summary>This single arm phase II study docetaxel , prednisone , sunitinib systemic therapy follow salvage external beam radiation therapy men experience PSA recurrence follow initial radical prostatectomy prostate cancer . The primary aim rate progression-free survival 2 year measure lack PSA progression evidence disease . We hypothesize aggressive initial systemic therapy improve long term remission rate men undergo salvage radiation therapy PSA recurrence absence metastatic disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multimodality Phase II Study Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many common malignancy breast cancer , trimodality therapy represent standard-of-care approach , include initial surgical resection follow systemic chemotherapy follow radiotherapy optimal local control , target hormonal biologic therapy period time reduce ongoing risk systemic disease recurrence . These approach reduce recurrence rate improve overall survival adjuvant set breast cancer ; however , treatment men PSA recurrence follow radical prostatectomy generally unsatisfying , give high rate persistent recurrent disease despite salvage radiotherapy . The primary purpose study determine rate biochemical ( PSA ) progression free survival ( bPFS ) men PSA recurrent non-metastatic prostate cancer follow radical prostatectomy , receive multimodality therapy consist local salvage external beam radiotherapy systemic docetaxel-based chemotherapy plus targeted anti-VEGF biologic therapy sunitinib . Biochemical PFS define proportion subject 24 month , post-registration , one following : 1 ) serum PSA value 0.2 ng/ml post-radiotherapy PSA nadir confirm 4 week later second PSA measurement high first amount , 2 ) continue rise PSA level follow study treatment nadir experience , define 2 rise value great baseline PSA separate least 4 week , 3 ) evidence clinical progression initiation systemic therapy progressive disease , 4 ) death . Secondary objective include find rate biochemical ( PSA ) disease free survival time , Two- , three- , five- , six- year risk local recurrence ( proportion ) , two- , three- , five- , six-year risk metastasis metastasis-free survival , two- , three- , five- , six-year risk metastasis metastasis-free survival , Safety , feasibility , tolerability assess NCI Common Toxicity Scales ( v3.0 ) , quality life questionnaire ( EPIC-short form survey ) , achievement accrual goal . Finally , comparison RNA expression profile original prostate radical prostatectomy specimen among PSA relapse 2 5 year compare without PSA relapse primary endpoint .</detailed_description>
