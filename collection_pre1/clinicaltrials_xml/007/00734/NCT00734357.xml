	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine one CT contrast agent ( medication inject vein ; use CT examination help produce clear image ) safer use another . This study compare safety two widely-used , U.S. FDA approve contrast agent , Isovue Omnipaque . The investigator hypothesize significant difference rate contrast-induced nephrotoxicity ( CIN ) agents overall population consist low-risk patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Investigation Intravenously Administered Omnipaque Isovue : Effects Serum Creatinine Concentration Outpatients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient without know kidney disease , exceptionally rare administration CT contrast agent injure kidney , rare injury occur almost always temporary ( week two ) heal . Indeed , significant injury rare kidney function patient routinely check receive CT contrast agent . There many brand contrast medium common use across United States , think past similarly low risk . The purpose study examine whether two different contrast material might differ risk kidney . We perform direct comparison Omnipaque-300 ( iohexol , 300 mg I/ml ) Isovue-300 ( Iopamidol , 300 mg I/ml ) low osmolality contrast agent determine relative CIN rate ( measure serum creatinine concentration ) low-risk patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 year age old Patients refer contrastenhanced CT examination . Such contrast enhance CT examination include , limited , certain examination head , neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis , etc . Patients le age 18 year age Pregnant patient Patients unable provide write informed consent Patients contraindication administration intravenous contrast material ( detailed Department Radiology intravenous contrast material use guideline ) , include renal contraindication ( University Michigan laboratory record recent serum creatinine concentration &gt; 1.5 mg/dl estimate glomerular filtration rate ( EGFR ) &lt; 60 ml/min ) ; serum creatinine available , patient receive contrast material base departmental guideline Patients undergo therapy agent purport reduce risk CIN ( acetylcysteine , theophylline , intravenous hydration ) Patients unable provide followup serum creatinine concentration measurement Patients undergo CT examination utilize high concentration iodine ( example , 370 mg I/ml contrast material ) Patients experience allergiclike reaction contrast ; include patient receive corticosteroid/antihistamine premedication reduce risk acute allergiclike reaction Patients receive study criterion dose contrast material ; patient contrast extravasation 5 ml occurs ( possible determine much contrast material patient receive direct intravenous injection ) Patients participate investigational drug , contrast material , device trial</criteria>
