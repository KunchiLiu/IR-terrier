	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation improve survival quality life patient end-stage organ failure . Despite dramatic improvement short-term survival , long-term survival renal allograft change little past decade . Recently , demonstrate chronic lesion originate already early transplantation subclinical rejection ( SCR ) protocol biopsy risk factor late graft loss . However efficacy high-dose corticosteroid therapy treatment SCR show inadequate . Thus , despite availability range available medication remain need therapeutic alternative patient may respond exist therapeutic choice , show improvement fibrosis reaction effect long term survival , may develop immunosuppression induce serious ( sometimes fatal ) side effect toxicity . In recent year become evident bone marrow ( BM ) derive mesenchymal stem cell potent immunomodulatory effect . MSCs pluripotent cell differentiate several mesenchymal tissue , include fibroblast , osteoblast , adipocytes chondrocyte progenitor . MSCs potent immunosuppressive effect T B cell vitro animal model chronic inflammation . Encouraging result obtain patient steroid resistant acute severe Graft versus Host Disease ( GvHD ) . The investigator hypothesize infusion MSCs may similarly provide novel treatment option treatment patient allograft rejection less side effect exist immunosuppressive therapies.This study evaluate safety feasibility MSC therapy renal recipient . In total 15 de novo renal recipient 2 HLA-DR mismatch live donor , men woman , 18-65 year age , recruit renal transplant clinic LUMC . Only patient SCR abd increase IF/TA protocol biopsy 4 week 6 month transplantation receive MSC infusion . MSCs patient without SCR biopsy use feasibility function study ( describe earlier ) . Subjects receive two dos 1 x 10.6 MSCs per kilogram body weight , intravenously , 7 day apart . The investigator investigate safety MSC therapy assess rate ( serious ) adverse event study population use World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion . Feasibility obtain determine number expand MSCs relation amount BM collect , number passage require time reach study target dos .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject willing participate study sign informed consent . Recipients first kidney graft live HLADR mismatch donor ( 2 HLADR mismatch ) . Subjects include study must kidney biopsy proven SCR 4 week transplantation . Patients must triple immunosuppressive therapy prednisone , CsA tacrolimus MMF accord current protocol . Panel Reactive Antibodies ( PRA ) â‰¤ 5 % . Patients must able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . If female childbearing age , subject must nonpregnant , nonbreastfeeding , use adequate contraception . Patients must able give informed consent consent must obtain prior study procedure . Double organ transplant recipient . Acute clinical rejection transplantation . Patients evidence active infection abcesses MSC infusion . Patients suffer hepatic failure . Patients suffer active autoimmune disease . Patients previous BM transplant . A psychiatric , addictive disorder compromise ability give truly informed consent participation study . Use investigational drug transplantation . Documented HIV infection , active hepatitis B , hepatitis C TB accord current transplantation inclusion criterion . Subjects currently active opportunistic infection ( e.g. , herpes zoster [ shingle ] , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , Pneumocystis carinii ( PCP ) , aspergillosis , histoplasmosis , mycobacteria TB ) transplantation . Malignancy ( include lymphoproliferative disease ) within past 25 year ( except squamous basal cell carcinoma skin treat evidence recurrence ) accord current transplantation inclusion criterion . Known recent substance abuse ( drug alcohol ) . Contraindications undergo BM biopsy .</criteria>
