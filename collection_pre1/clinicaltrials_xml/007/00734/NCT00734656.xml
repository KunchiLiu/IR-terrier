	<brief_summary>This study explore hypothesis effect alcohol part mediate increased production neuroactive steroid , interact GABAA-receptors . We propose study non-dependent drinker use 4-session within-subjects design alcohol / placebo pair dutasteride / placebo pretreatment . Dutasteride 5-alpha steroid reductase ( 5AR ) inhibitor limit production dihydrotestosterone 5a-reduced neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone , pregnanolone 3a,5a-androstanediol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alcohol multiple pharmacological effect , though effect relate risk alcohol dependence clear . Animal study indicate neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone alcohol-modulated endogenous agonist GABAA receptor genetic variation steroid 5a-reductase type I gene generates neuroactive steroid , may moderate alcohol effect . To good define role neuroactive steroid conduct laboratory study non-alcohol dependent drinker use 4-session design alcohol/placebo beverage pair dutasteride/placebo pretreatment . Dutasteride , inhibitor type I type II 5a-reductase enzyme , block production 5a-reduced neuroactive steroid . This study extend preliminary finding finasteride include ) placebo control alcohol , b ) specific inhibitor 5a-reductase isoenzymes , c ) large group subject ( include light heavy drinker ) .</detailed_description>

Drinking history : All subject must report least one occasion prior month drink least 3 drink single day ; additionally , LD subject select drink 13 drink , 13 time per week ( 5 drink per week average ) , one occasion past 2 month drank &gt; 4 drink . HD subject select report drink least 10 drink per week , least one episode per week heavy drinking . Main Study : Subjects current past DSMIV diagnosis alcohol drug dependence , current past 24months diagnosis alcohol drug abuse another major psychiatric disorder , neurological illness , hypersensitivity reaction dutasteride , evidence liver dysfunction , currently use benzodiazepine , psychotropic medication medication know influence steroid hormone level metabolism modify effect alcohol . Nicotinedependent subject exclude avoid confounding effect nicotine withdrawal daylong laboratory session . Women allow participate . Subjects anticipate move area period plan study participation exclude study entry .</criteria>
