	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine timing onset puberty may affect FSH-regulatory peptide . We determine peptide relate FSH production prepubertal pubertal child compare regulation FSH control child precocious ( early ) puberty delay puberty . In pilot study , stimulate pubertal axis use agonist GnRH determine pubertal response activin-A , inhibin-A -B follistatin . To determine baseline FSH secretion FSH-regulatory peptide tone , block GnRH specific antagonist . These study lead well understanding role FSH control onset puberty pathogenesis pubertal disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Girls begin puberty earlier much 5-fold increase incidence precocious puberty boy , boy likely delay adolescence compare girl . The reason sex difference time puberty sex-based variation expression pubertal disorder know . Puberty herald increase episodic release luteinizing hormone ( LH ) control increase gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) release . It think sex difference central nervous system restraint GnRH subsequently LH secretion account difference time onset puberty boy girl . Follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) secretion readily detect prior onset puberty exhibit sexual dimorphism basal GnRH-stimulated concentration . Thus , assessment factor regulate FSH secretion childhood may enhance understand sex difference pubertal development pathogenesis precocious puberty . Although FSH secrete control GnRH , FSH also secrete constitutively control group peptides collectively know FSH-regulatory protein . These peptide include activins , peptide increase FSH secretion inhibins follistatins , peptide suppress FSH secretion . Gonadal inhibins inhibit FSH via endocrine negative feedback , production puberty begin understood . Activin follistatin thought principle paracrine role FSH regulation recent data demonstrate peptide endocrine role well . We hypothesize difference elaboration activins , inhibins , follistatin alter FSH constitutive secretion underlie precocious delay puberty boy girls account , part , sex difference pubertal timing . Specifically expect inhibitory regulator , inhibins and/or follistatins , low stimulatory regulator , activin , high early compare delayed puberty . FSH Onset Puberty case control study compare boy precocious puberty boy delay adolescence girl precocious puberty girl delay adolescence . Hypothesis : Basal GnRH agonist-stimulated activin concentration great inhibin concentration low child early puberty child delay adolescence , GnRH antagonist , ganirelix , decrease activin concentration child early puberty delayed adolescence . Specific Aim 1 : Determine degree FSH-regulatory peptide , compare gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) , control FSH secretion child suppress GnRH ganirelix child early delay adolescence . Specific Aim 2 : Determine role FSH-regulatory peptide control time onset puberty compare concentration without GnRH stimulation FSH child precocious puberty delay adolescence . Specific Aim 3 : Determine role GnRH control FSH-regulatory peptide compare activin , inhibin follistatin concentration child delay adolescence due constitutional growth delay delay adolescence hypogonadotropic hypogonadism</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Early Puberty Children early puberty may participate study . Children must 6 10 year age healthy exception early puberty . For early puberty , girl onset breast development prior 8 year age boys onset pubic hair growth genital growth prior 9 year age . Inclusion Criteria Delayed Puberty Children late ( delay ) puberty may participate study . Children must 12 17 year age healthy exception late puberty . In order late puberty , boys girl short stature compare family least one year delay bone age determine bone age xray and/or onset secondary sexual characteristic ( breast pubic hair growth ) 12 year age later girl 13 year age later boy . Early Puberty Children know genetic disorder , chronic medical condition require use steroid , use medication puberty within last 3 month exclude . Delayed Puberty Children know genetic disorder exception possible hypogonadotropic hypogonadism , chronic medical condition require use steroid , use medication puberty within last 3 month exclude .</criteria>
