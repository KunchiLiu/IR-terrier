	<brief_summary>This Study look effect substance call `` angiogenic factor '' ( development new blood vessel ) development severe liver disease . The result may help understand factor involve repair regeneration liver tissue see different type liver disease associate different type factor , especially severe liver disease call hepatorenal syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Of Angiogenic Factors In The Development Of Hepatorenal Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal dysfunction patient also suffer end stage liver disease associate increased morbidity mortality compart patient suffer liver disease alone . If frank renal failure develop patient cirrhosis ascites , median survival time onset renal failure approximately 2 week . Kidney dysfunction may transient , secondary pooling blood splanchnic bed consequent reduction renal blood flow . In instance , liver transplantation restoration normal circulatory pattern result return normal renal function . Currently , diagnostic test differentiate temporary permanent renal dysfunction presence end stage liver disease . As result , number combine liver-kidney transplant occur steadily increase . Slightly 20 % ( 8 38 ) liver transplant perform service 2004 combine liver-kidney transplant . The double procedure increase length anesthesia exposure surgical time , presence transplant kidney may require increased immunosuppression comparison liver-only transplant . We plan examine role angiogenic factor abnormal blood flow pattern know associated hepatorenal syndrome . Specimen analysis : Circulating level cytokine growth factor measure use commercially available ELISAs . Matrix metalloproteins measure quantitative electrophoresis . Expression A20 determine extraction total RNA whole blood use Trizol run standard Northern blot methodology . RNA hybridize [ ³²P ] -dATP label A20 probe glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) β-actin probe correct uneven loading . Similar RNA extraction perform liver tissue obtain time surgery . Microarray analysis perform extract identify specific gene may involve pathogenesis HRS . Results laboratory analysis correlate clinical parameter attempt make identify specific cytokine up-regulated gene particular phase degree renal dysfunction patient liver disease . Similar analysis perform patient type hepatic disease .</detailed_description>
