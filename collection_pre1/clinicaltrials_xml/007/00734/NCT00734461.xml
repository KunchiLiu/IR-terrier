	<detailed_description>At conclusion screen period , qualify subject negative urine drug screen ethanol breath test admit inpatient research unit . After 24 hour observation period confirm subject undergoing opioid withdrawal , subject randomly receive either 30 mg oxycodone match placebo two consecutive day double-blind fashion . The purpose oxycodone vs. placebo qualify period select subject positive drug like response orient subject various scale . Only subject positive response visual analog `` Liking '' scale least 20 point higher active oxycodone vs. placebo eligible continue double-blind 7-way crossover study . Fourteen subject randomize one fourteen sequence . Each subject receive single dose one follow 7 treatment : Placebo , oxycodone 20 mg , oxycodone 40 mg , oxycodone 20 mg/naltrexone 0.001 mg , oxycodone 40 mg/naltrexone 0.001 mg , oxycodone 20 mg/naltrexone 0.0001 mg , oxycodone 40 mg/naltrexone 0.0001 mg. Oxycodone naltrexone formulate combination single tablet . All tablet identical appearance . The identity treatment unknown study personnel subject . Immediately prior specify time point administration single dose study drug , subject complete follow subjective scale : visual analog scale ( VAS ) drug effect , high , good effect , bad effect , like , sick ; adjective rating ( agonist antagonist scale ) . Subjects also ask complete money versus drug questionnaire various time point drug administration . Observers complete adjective rating scale . Safety monitor vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate , pulse oximetry ) , adverse event assessment , clinical laboratory test , physical examination electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) . In addition , pupil diameter ( measure photograph ) obtain monitor physiological sign opioid effect . The first double-blind dose study drug administer least 24 hour last dose two day qualify period . Dosings separate washout period least 120 hour ( see sample calendar Section 6.5 ) .
