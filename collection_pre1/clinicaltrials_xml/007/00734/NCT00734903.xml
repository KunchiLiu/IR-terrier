If gender-specific approach treatment effective 12-Step Facilitation Veterans SUD VA , may substantially improve physical mental health outcome woman Veterans , decrease healthcare cost provide replicable method deliver treatment . Project Background : SUD common among woman Veterans , rise among young woman Veterans . As woman Veterans seek treatment VA , likely increase need evidence-based treatment SUD . To investigator ' knowledge , PI develop gender-based treatment approach show significant outcome pilot trial , multiple domain . This proposal represent opportunity evaluate efficacy woman Veterans , include young OIF/OEF Veterans . Project Objectives : The goal proposal examine efficacy evidence-based gender-specific model treatment woman Veterans SUD comparison control condition gender-specific ( 12-Step Facilitation ) . The long-term objective improve treatment outcome woman Veterans SUD use gender-specific model design sensitive woman 's unique need . Project Methods : The investigator plan conduct randomized clinical trial woman Veterans SUD assign either gender-specific model treatment ( A Woman 's Path Recovery ; WPR ) , control condition ( 12-Step Facilitation ; 12SF ) ; latter include gender-specific treatment .

The treatment phase consist 12 week weekly therapy ; participant receive treatment-as-usual ( treatment choose attend ) . Assessments conduct baseline , Months 1 2 , end treatment 3 month follow . The study power detect effect .80 .05 level significance sample size . Cross-sectional , repeated measure longitudinal analysis propose . The primary outcome variable substance use , variety secondary outcome ( e.g. , psychosocial functioning , psychiatric symptom , cop skill , 12-step attendance ) also explore . The investigator evaluate potential mechanism action WPR secondary question interest . Biological measure include validate substance use self-report participant . The investigator hypothesize participant experimental condition ( WPR ) positive outcome primary secondary variable , high level treatment satisfaction compare control condition ( 12SF ) mediators/moderators outcomes ( i.e. , mechanism action ) knowledge gender-specific substance abuse recovery concept use cop skill .</detailed_description>
