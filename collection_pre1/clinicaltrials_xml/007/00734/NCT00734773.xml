	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill cancer cell . Motexafin gadolinium may make cancer cell sensitive radiation therapy combination chemotherapy . Giving motexafin gadolinium together chemotherapy , rituximab , radiation therapy may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give motexafin gadolinium together combination chemotherapy , rituximab , whole-brain radiation therapy see well work treat patient newly diagnose primary central nervous system lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study MGd + High-dose MTX-Based Chemoimmunotherapy + RT Newly Dx PCNSL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety efficacy motexafin gadolinium ( MGd ) combine high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy radiotherapy patient newly diagnose primary CNS lymphoma . - Determine toxicity MGd rituximab combine high-dose methotrexate , procarbazine hydrochloride , vincristine ( MPV ) patient . - Determine toxicity MGd combination whole-brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) patient . - Determine tumor-selective uptake MGd . Secondary - Determine overall response rate ( complete remission [ CR ] partial remission [ PR ] ) patient treat pre-radiotherapy chemo-immunotherapy ( R-MPV MGd ) . - Determine complete response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine overall response rate ( CR PR ) patient complete MGd combine high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy WBRT . - Determine event-free overall survival 1 year patient treat regimen . - Determine progression-free survival 1 year patient treat regimen . - Evaluate neurotoxicity R-MVP MGd base pre- post-treatment neuropsychologic testing . OUTLINE : - Tumor-selective imaging : Patients receive motexafin gadolinium ( MGd ) IV day 1-2 begin 1-2 week prior induction therapy . They undergo MRI brain . - Induction therapy : Patients receive methotrexate IV 2-3 hour vincristine IV day 1 rituximab IV 5 hour MGd IV 30-60 minute day 8 . Patients also receive oral procarbazine hydrochloride day 1-7 course 1 , 3 , 5 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients partial response receive additional 2 course induction therapy . - Chemoradiotherapy : Beginning 4 week completion induction therapy , patient undergo reduced-dose whole-brain radiotherapy 6 week . Patients also receive MGd IV 30-60 minute , begin 2-5 hour prior radiotherapy , 10 day every day radiotherapy . - Consolidation therapy : After completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive cytarabine IV 3 hour day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 30 day 2 course . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month first year , every 3-4 month second year , every 4-6 month fifth year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
