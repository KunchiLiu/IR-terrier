	<brief_title>Bortezomib With Melphalan Prednisone Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based need improve front-line therapy patient less likely undergo transplant , promise recent vitro clinical work melphalan bortezomib , propose prospective trial bortezomib add standard melphalan prednisone therapy previously untreated patient multiple myeloma . Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 give twice weekly two week add standard melphalan prednisone 4-week cycle . This three-drug combination compare historical data . We treat 2 patient relapsed disease follow &gt; 2 prior regimen include high-dose therapy autologous stem cell support . Each patient receive melphalan , prednisone , bortezomib describe marked decline M-protein within 2 cycle . These response sustain least 3 month treatment well tolerate . Eligible patient histologically confirm Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) receive prior systemic therapy give intent induce remission , adult , life expectancy great 3 month , adequate performance status , organ marrow function describe protocol , pregnant , HIV positive , take investigational agent . Patients must history allergic reaction study drug similar compound uncontrolled intercurrent illness social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients must also ability give inform consent . Study drug administer inpatient outpatient basis . Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 administer intravenously 3-5 second bolus day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 28 day cycle . Six cycle plan . On day melphalan bortezomib give , melphalan give least one hour prior bortezomib . Melphalan 6 mg/m2 administer orally empty stomach daily day 1-7 cycle . Prednisone 60 mg/m2 administer orally daily day 1-7 cycle . Supportive care measure antiemetic growth factor may give .</detailed_description>
