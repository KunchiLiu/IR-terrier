	<brief_summary>Toward improve therapeutic index standard TT3 ( S-TT3 ) , investigator employ randomized Phase III trial design determine whether S-TT3 treatment-related toxicity reduce 50 % TT3-Lite ( L-TT3 ) . Note : Randomization discontinue accrual close L-TT3 arm . This trial currently enrol single-arm trial patient receive S-TT3 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The major treatment-related toxicity TT3 pertain high-dose melphalan 200mg/m2 ( MEL200 ) -based tandem transplant approach , consist mucosal toxicity . For TT4 trial , propose compare standard TT3 ( S-TT3 ) TT3-Lite ( L-TT3 ) . L-TT3 employ various strategy aim improve therapeutic Index S-TT3 reduce toxicity maintain superior result report S-TT3 term frequency duration CR , EFS , . The following strategy utilized L-TT3 : - Applying 1 instead 2 cycle induction consolidation therapy prior tandem transplant . This support well know association prior exposure mucotoxic therapies4 , 5 bad post-transplant mucositis , particularly etoposide use mobilize regimen6 VDTPACE . Note : Randomization discontinue accrual close L-TT3 arm . This trial currently enrol single-arm trial patient receive S-TT3 .</detailed_description>
