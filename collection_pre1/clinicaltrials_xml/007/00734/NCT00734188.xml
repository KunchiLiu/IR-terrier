	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Safety Study 188Re-PTI-6D2 Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients confirm Stage III ( unresectable ) Stage IV melanoma meet eligibility criterion undergo thorough physical examination baseline tumor image document baseline tumor measurement . Patients allow check study center either even prior dosing ( Study Day 0 ) day dose ( Study Day 1 ) base upon principal investigator ( PIs ) discretion . All patient dose monitored inpatient study . Patients receive intravenous ( IV ) infusion 188Re-PTI-6D2 . Patients undergo serial gamma scan specify time point . Blood sample obtain prior dose specify interval PK measurement mAb well measurement serum radioactivity . Urine collect measure excrete radioactivity . Patients closely monitor safety throughout duration study . Patients remain study center 48-72 hour infusion radiolabeled dose allow adequate time post-treatment safety observation rhenium decay . No investigational commercial agent therapy study agent may administer intent treat patient 's malignancy inpatient treatment period . After three evaluable patient follow minimum 2-6 week 188Re-PTI-6D2 infusion , Principal Investigator PTI Medical Monitor review safety data patient current dose level . If evidence dose-limiting toxicity , dose 188Re-PTI-6D2 escalate next cohort patient . Dose escalation 188Re-PTI-6D2 occur accord follow titration scheme : Level 1 = 20-30 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 10 - 50 mg antibody Level 2 = 40-60 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 10 - 50 mg antibody Level 3 = 75-100 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 50 - 100 mg antibody Level 4 = 125-150 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 50 - 100 mg antibody Level 5 = 175-200 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 50 - 100 mg antibody Dose-limiting toxicity define follow : Grade 4 hematological toxicity ; ≥ Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity ; adverse event result permanent discontinuation infusion . If time Grade 5 toxicity observe , accrual suspend review . If 0 3 patient experience DLT , next cohort 3 patient enrol next dose level . If 1 3 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity , additional three evaluable patient enrol current dose level . Dose escalation occur maximum tolerate dose determine . The MTD define dose precede dose 2 3 2 6 patient experience DLT . Safety evaluate vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate temperature ) , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKGs ) , clinical laboratory test adverse event monitoring . Laboratory study include hematology , chemistry urinalysis baseline , end inpatient treatment period , 2 week 6 week infusion 188Re-PTI-6D2 dose . If hematological recovery occur week 6 , patient follow-up monthly hematological recovery . In addition , thyroid function test perform baseline 6 week infusion ; monthly recovery ( occur ) . Human anti-murine antibody ( HAMA ) measure baseline , 2 week , 6 week infusion . Biodistribution 188Re-PTI-6D2 evaluated whole body image gamma camera immediately infusion ( 0 - 2 hr . ) , 2.5 - 5 hour , 6 - 8 hour , 24 hour post-infusion . Whole body image 48 72 hour post-infusion may conduct discretion PI . Urine collected measure cumulative radioactivity excretion 48-72 hour post-infusion ( depend hospital discharge date ) . Pharmacokinetics mAb radioactivity determine blood sample take 48-72 hour post-infusion ( depend hospital discharge date ) . Dosimetry calculation perform determine estimate absorbed radiation dose critical organ tumor . Patients discharge study unit 48-72 hour infusion 188Re-PTI-6D2 later determine Investigator 's clinical judgment . Patients required return post-treatment follow-up visit approximately 2 6 week ( ± two day ) infusion safety monitoring . Ongoing follow-up visit continue disease progression every 4 week . Tumor measurement perform baseline , follow-up visit assess tumor response . Patients unacceptable adverse event event follow resolution .</detailed_description>
