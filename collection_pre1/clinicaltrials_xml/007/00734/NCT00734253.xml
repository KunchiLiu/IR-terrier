	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Pyridorin Patients With Nephropathy Due Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic kidney disease afflict 20 % diabetic major cause end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . There estimate 1.2 million diabetic overt nephropathy patient US , approximately 5.1 million diabetic patient exhibit sign develop kidney disease . Hyperglycemia-induced microvascular disease fundamental cause diabetic kidney disease . More specifically , hyperglycemia perturbs metabolic pathway , particularly tissues regulate intracellular glucose level . This favor broad range pathogenic oxidative chemistry include formation advance glycation end-products ( AGEs ) , toxic carbonyl , reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) consider principal causative factor development diabetic microvascular disease . Pyridorin™ show inhibit AGE formation scavenge ROS toxic carbonyl compound extensive vitro study . The therapeutic potential Pyridorin™ demonstrate vivo extensive preclinical study carry number independent laboratory prominent investigator . In addition , Pyridorin™ demonstrate significant treatment effect slow progression diabetic nephropathy two Phase 2 clinical trial . Thus , solid scientific rationale clinical evidence exist application Pyridorin™ therapy slow progression diabetic kidney disease . NephroGenex initiate new Phase 2b clinical trial ( PYR-210 ) evaluate safety efficacy Pyridorin™ slow progression overt nephropathy patient type 2 diabetes . This trial incorporate late discussion FDA regard use approvable surrogate marker would subsequently confirm hard clinical endpoint . In double-blind , placebo-controlled study , eligible type 2 diabetic patient overt nephropathy treat one year bid dose either Pyridorin™ 150 mg , Pyridorin™ 300 mg , placebo . The primary endpoint study change serum creatinine ( SCr ) baseline 1 year therapy . Secondary 1-year endpoint include slope SCr , change protein/creatinine ratio ( PCR ) derive 24-hour urine collection , change baseline slope serum cystatin C. The patient population study type 2 diabetic overt nephropathy define SCr 1.3 3.3 mg/dl female 1.5 3.5 mg/dl male , accompany proteinuria macroalbuminuric range ( PCR least 1200 mg/g ) . In order reduce confound variable , careful control blood pressure ( BP ) require . If yet control , patient 's BP bring level investigator believe appropriate patient prior randomization , remain target BP patient remainder study . Also , patient permit one ACE inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) drug inhibit renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis throughout study . A run-in period require patient achieve BP ACEi/ARB requirement . This study conduct leadership Collaborative Study Group .</detailed_description>
