	<brief_summary>The trial single-center randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , placebo positive control , parallel group clinical trial . This trial investigate whether NOMAC-E2 ( Org 10486 -0 + Org 2317 ) , new combine hormonal contraceptive , potential delay cardiac repolarization . The primary measure cardiac repolarization trial Fridericia correct QT interval ( QTcF ) . QTcF represent duration ventricular depolarization subsequent repolarization . A delay cardiac repolarization create electrophysiological environment favor development cardiac arrhythmia , clearly torsade de pointes ( TdP ) , possibly ventricular tachyarrhythmias . The primary aim study investigate , administration therapeutic ( 2.5/1.5 mg ) supra-therapeutic ( high require treatment : 12.5/7.5 mg ) dose NOMAC-E2 administered period 14 day prolong mean QTcF interval value accept threshold regulatory concern . In addition , single dose moxifloxacin administer order prove sensitivity apply assay sufficient detect prolongation QTcF-interval . Secondary aim study evaluate relation concentration NOMAC ( therapeutic supra-therapeutic ) steady state reach subject 's body , time match change Estradiol E1 E2 relation baseline QTcF interval multiple dose administration NOMAC-E2 . Finally , safety tolerability different treatment investigate . A total 189 subject participate trial . The entire study duration 9 week 4-week screening period , 14-day treatment period follow-up period 3 week .</brief_summary>
