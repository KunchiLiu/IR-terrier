	<brief_summary>This first study human SCH 900776 evaluate safety tolerability give monotherapy combination gemcitabine participant advance solid tumor lymphoma . Participants enrol cohort receive sequentially high dos SCH 900776 combination standard dose gemcitabine The recommended combination dose Phase 2 trial ( combination-RP2D ) determine base safety biological activity . Up 10 15 additional participant may study combination-RP2D .</brief_summary>
