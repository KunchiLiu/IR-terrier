	<detailed_description>Background Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) constitute 3 % malignancy sixth common malignancy worldwide . There estimate 40,000 new case 11,000 death United States 2007 approximately 500,000 case worldwide yearly [ 1 ] . Squamous cell carcinoma account least 90 % head neck cancer . Surgical resection remain standard treatment patient resectable HNSCC . For patient high risk local distant relapse , radiation therapy ( RT ) alone , combination chemotherapy , give surgery improve loco-regional control overall survival . Moreover , surgery often represent curative option patient relapse locoregionally . Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) lead cause death worldwide . NSCLC infrequently diagnose cancer eradicate surgical extirpation . Specific Aims - To determine modulation biomarkers EGFR and/or Src target head neck lung cancer . - To determine biomarker modulation associate reduction tumor volume and/or evidence histologic response tumor ( e.g . decrease proliferation and/or decrease apoptosis ) well safety tolerability . Subject population Patients accrue head neck lung cancer patient surgical candidate . Surgery primary curative treatment patient enrol study . Patients require standard induction treatment prior surgery . Surgery best treatment option determine treat physician . Therefore , delay chemoradiotherapy curative treatment . We plan include stage HNSCC NSCLC manage primary surgery . If surgery unexpectedly cancel , patient remove study unless accessible lesion biopsy . Ideally , pre-treatment biopsy intraoperative sample obtain site ( multiple lesion ) . Please see Section 3.0 detailed eligibility criterion . Treatment Plan The study drug placebo take 14-21 day , discontinue one day prior plan surgical resection . If surgery delayed , study drug placebo continue one day prior surgery , maximum 28 day . Seven day minimum treatment patient evaluate . The interval last dose experimental drug surgery 12-36 hour . Please see Section 5.0 treatment plan detail . If combination erlotinib dasatinib result toxicity leading delay surgery , study terminate . Statistical design sample size This 4-arm randomized trial intend estimate effect short-term preoperative therapy EGFR Src inhibitor upon panel biomarkers . The 4 treatment arm erlotinib , dasatinib , combination , placebo . We anticipate accrue 56 evaluable patient ( 14 patient per arm ) .</detailed_description>
