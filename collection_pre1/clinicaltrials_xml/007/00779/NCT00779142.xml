	<brief_summary>It well known blindness one fear disability express patient United States . Estimates economic impact visual disability current population exceed 30 million US dollar country alone . The reason figure many ; however age related macular degeneration ( ARMD ) , diabetic retinopathy , glaucoma uveitis responsible majority permanent visual disability hence cost quality life place economic burden society . Research may help reverse various abnormal biological response lead worsen clinical manifestation diabetic retinopathy would valuable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utility Intravitreal Methotrexate Diabetic Macular Edema Resistant Conventional Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The common reason decreased vision diabetic retinopathy macular edema . Current approach macular edema include FDA approve intervention laser well underlie control disease co morbid condition . 'Off label ' intervention include intravitreal triamcinolone bevacizumab , demonstrate efficacious ; least short term ( week ) carry significant risk . Surgical approach still controversial show long term benefit . Unfortunately , subset patient resistant therapy . Intravitreal therapy utilize methotrexate 400 ug ( MTX ) use ophthalmologic condition associate inflammation drive macular edema . bevacizumab anti VEGF agent utilized disease macular degeneration favorable effect . It know certain similar inflammatory mediator play role diabetic macular edema . It would logical evaluate efficacy MTX anti inflammatory anti metabolite low concentration diabetic patient macular edema fail conventional FDA approve well study label therapy involve laser and/or intravitreal drug .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient ( 18 year old ) clinically significant macular edema ( CSME ) visual acuity le 20/60 Hand motion study eye . Patients persistent CSME three month laser therapy three month intraocular injection Avastin triamcinolone . These intervention could multiple combine . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) scan demonstrate 275 micron retinal thickness central subfield study eye . Ability understand study instruction , intervention potential complication . History reasonably control Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , â‰¤ 8.5HbA1c evaluate last 3 month . Ability undergo contraceptive protection 3 month intraocular injection . Clear demonstration ( female patient ) commitment avoid pregnancy negative urine pregnancy test baseline woman childbearing potential . Clear understanding teratogenic potential MTX . History allergy MTX . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , visual acuity loss would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigment abnormality , dense subfoveal hard exudate , nonretinal condition . An ocular condition present ( diabetes ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , epiretinal membrane , etc. ) . An eye treat Glaucoma Eyes underwent vitrectomy History intraocular malignancy . Intraocular surgery prior 3 month . Recent significant change diabetic medication . Insulin usage less year . Life threaten co morbidity cancer therapy . Use oral , intravenous , periocular intraocular corticosteroid ( steroid ) prior 3 month . Liver function exceed three time upper limit normal baseline , within 6 week appointment . Pregnant female . Vitreous hemorrhage ( active ) study eye Anticipation need laser pan retinal photocoagulation next 6 month . Media opacities Herpetic disease cornea Corneal dystrophy significant corneal edema . Any major surgery within last 30 day</criteria>
