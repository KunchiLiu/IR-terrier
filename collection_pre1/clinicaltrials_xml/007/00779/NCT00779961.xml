	<brief_summary>The effect timing cleft palate repair speech development , velopharyngeal functioning , facial growth remain unknown . The objective study determine effectiveness early palatal repair versus The Hospital Sick Children ( SickKids ) routine palatal repair isolate cleft palate patient compare speech development , velopharyngeal function facial growth outcome . The null hypothesis difference speech development , velopharyngeal function facial growth early palatal repair SickKids routine palatal repair isolate cleft palate patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Investigation Optimal Timing Cleft Palate Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal palatoplasty provide intact palate create normally function velopharyngeal mechanism early possible without hazard aspect health development . Two major criterion success cleft palate surgery determine subsequent speech development facial growth . Therefore , debate timing cleft palate surgery focus need early palatoplasty speech purpose versus later palatoplasty ensure undisturbed facial growth . A compromise solution controversy propose Schweckendiek ; soft palate repair early age leave hard palate cleft unrepaired later life . The premise primary veloplasty result function velopharyngeal mechanism early speech development , unrepaired hard palate allow unrestricted maxillary growth . The speech outcomes patient undergone delayed stage palate repair address several study case series . However , little evidence support benefit delay stage repair respect facial growth speech development . Results publish study show speech result relatively poor fistula rate unacceptably high . These result lead vast majority North American surgeon favour primary one-stage repair . Yet , optimum timing primary palate repair remain unknown . No randomized control trial prospective cohort study conduct address question .</detailed_description>
