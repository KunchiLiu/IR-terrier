	<brief_title>Amantadine Treatment Traumatic Brain Injury Irritability Aggression : A Multi-site Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE OF PROJECT : To study effect amantadine 100 mg administer twice daily compare placebo irritability baseline treatment Day 28 . SUMMARY OF PROJECT : It anticipate 168 subject 168 correspond subject informant recruit study . Carolinas Rehabilitation , lead center , 5 collaborating center enroll approximately 28 subject . Subjects recruit primarily clinic . Also , letter send patient data base . If first encounter research personnel telephone , research assistant obtain verbal ( telephone ) consent subject 's informant Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) subject irritability . The score questionnaire must ≥ 6 qualification . This allow pre-screening take place avoid unnecessary clinic visit . Subjects consent qualify randomized 1:1 ratio , amantadine placebo . Stratification randomization group occur base presence depression define Beck 's Depression Inventory-II ( BDI-II ) score ≥ 13 . Randomized subject receive amantadine placebo 100 mg twice daily every morning 12 Noon . There 4 clinic visit . Visits occur baseline , consent screening , day 28 , day 60 day 90 . At 4 clinic visit , subject informant give questionnaire regard subject 's behavior mood . Follow phone call occur week subject see clinic end study . Follow phone call assess study medication compliance , adverse event concomitant medication change . Day 60 end period Randomized Clinical Trial phase study subject begin 1 month continuation phase study participant receive active amantadine . The following questionnaire use measure irritability subject informant : Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) , State Trait Anger Expression Inventory ( STAXI-2 ) , Global Impression Change . The following questionnaire dispense subject : Short Form -12 , Satisfaction With Life Scale , Patient Health Questionnaire , Beck Depression Inventory , Brief Symptom Inventory , Family Assessment Device , Fatigue Impact Scale , test cognitive function . The Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended complete research assistant use information obtain primarily informant . The Investigator complete Clinical Global Impression change Visits 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . History Physical Exam , creatinine level ( kidney function ) obtain safety tolerability . Serum pregnancy test draw screen female childbearing potential .</detailed_description>
