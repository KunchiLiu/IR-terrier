	<brief_summary>Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) autoimmune disease unknown origin . It involve multiple organ include joint , skin , kidneys central nervous system . The disease process cause dysfunction immune system . The drug currently use treatment SLE partially effective carry significant risk side-effects . Rapamycin , also call sirolimus Rapamune , approve FDA prevent rejection organ transplant daily dose 2 mg 8 mg . Patients resistant intolerant conventional medication effectively treat Rapamycin able decrease amount prednisone need . The purpose study prospectively determine therapeutic efficacy mechanism action Rapamune patient SLE . Healthy subject receive Rapamune ask donate blood serve control . As part research effort understand reason variation effect treatment drug different individual , sub-study DNA makeup subject enrol trial also do . The purpose sub-study possibly determine whether different response drug use treat SLE correlation difference genetic makeup subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Rapamycin Treatment SLE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 SLE subject 40 healthy control recruit . The study last 1 year 9 study visit day 0 day 360 . The healthy control need donate blood . The study drug , Rapamune , manufacture Pfizer Pharmaceuticals . It take mouth start dose 2mg/day . The dose adjust achieve blood level range 6-15 ng/ml ( level find effective prevent organ rejection ) . Blood sample obtain take Rapamune , every two week first month , every three month 1 year , three month later check effect discontinue rapamycin . Each SLE subject ask provide 100 ml ( 20 teaspoon ) blood visit . The first 6 visit take place within 3 month remain 3 visit every 3 month . Routine laboratory work perform . Part blood drawn use research part use routine lab work part standard care . The non-routine laboratory study include : 1 . Assessment mitochondrial function intact T cell 2 . Analysis mTOR activity , FKBP12 expression , global gene expression lupus T cell . 3 . Predictors therapeutic efficacy rapamycin SLE . The study drug level check every visit . The non-routine laboratory study perform Visits 0 8 SLE subject Visit 0 healthy control subject . Healthy control subject match age ( decade less ) , gender , ethnic origin . They recruit analyzed day lupus subject . All subject sign inform consent visit 0 . There separate inform consent main study , one SLE subject one Healthy Controls . The subject participate genetic sub-study . They must sign another informed consent genetic sub-study , one SLE subject one Healthy Controls . There need additional blood draw since part blood drawn main study use genetic sub-study .</detailed_description>
