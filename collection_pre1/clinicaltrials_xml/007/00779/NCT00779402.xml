	<brief_summary>The PROTECT-PROvenge Treatment Early Cancer Treatment trial Phase IIIB trial patient hormone sensitive prostate cancer . The study conduct 15 participating center throughout US . The purpose study determine Provenge effective treatment early stage , non-metastatic prostate cancer . If rise PSA radical prostatectomy , evidence yet metastasis , may eligible . The study compare active vaccine placebo ( dendritic cell activate laboratory ) determine whether product delay time cancer progress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , double blind , control , randomize trial immunotherapy prostatic acid phosphatase ( PAP ) -loaded autologous antigen present cell ( APCs ) , subject non metastatic prostate cancer . Subjects qualify study men previously undergone prostatectomy whose sign disease recurrence rise serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) . The primary objective compare time biochemical failure ( BF , PSA great equal 3 ng/mL ) sipuleucel-T ( treatment group ) placebo ( control group ) , study safety sipuleucel-T . The secondary objective compare time distant failure ( DF , distant metastatic disease ) , PSA double time ( PSADT ) , survival 2 treatment group . Following short-term open-label treatment luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone-analogue ( LHRH-a ) , subject randomize blinded treatment assignment either sipuleucel-T placebo 2:1 ratio . Following randomization , subject undergo 3 leukapheresis procedure alternate week ( Weeks 0 , 2 , 4 ) . Approximately three day follow leukapheresis procedure , subject receive infusion either sipuleucel-T placebo . Subjects complete checklist specify time study . This checklist design compare androgen suppression-related side effect period without androgen suppression . Subjects evaluate periodically safety efficacy endpoint . At time BF confirm , subject eligible booster infusion . The booster process consist 1 leukapheresis procedure follow 1 infusion treatment assignment , sipuleucel-T placebo , allocate randomization . Subjects continue observe DF confirm bone scan compute tomography ( CT ) scan , image modality clinically indicate . After confirmed DF , subject follow safety survival remainder life . The total time study subject estimate approximately 10 13 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible : Histologic diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate ; At least 3 month 8 year prior study entry , undergone radical prostatectomy stage T1b &amp; # 8211 ; T3c , N0N1 , M0 disease , without subsequent adjuvant salvage radiation therapy . Patients experience first PSA recurrence within 2 year post completion initial therapy curative intent eligible without consideration Gleason score tumor specimen . * Patients experience first PSA relapse 2 8 year post completion initial therapy curative intent eligible Gleason score tumor specimen &gt; 7 ; ( * For patient receive adjuvant radiation , date final dose radiotherapy use mark date completion therapy curative intent . For patient receive salvage radiation postoperative PSA recurrence adjuvant radiation , date surgery mark date completion therapy curative intent . ) Therapeutic PSA response primary therapy 0.4 ng/mL ; Tumor specimen positive PAP , vaccine &amp; # 8217 ; target . Immunohistological stain specimen surgically excise tumor expression PAP conduct IMPATH , may complete even LHRHanalogue placement , long positive ( + ) result confirm prior randomization ( Week 0 ) . If slide tumor obtain pathology archive , chart record PRESURGERY blood sample show serum PAP elevate upper limit local reference range may serve proxy . Experienced PSA relapse currently receive androgen ablation therapy . Specifically , record must 2 PSA value separate least 3 month , detectable range ( &gt; 0.5 ng/mL ) , show increase least 0.3 ng/mL 2 measurement . The first 2 PSA value must rise previously record postoperative nadir value ( may undetectable PSA ) . In patient receive androgen ablation previous PSA relapse , PSA must increase level least 25 % nadir observed therapy absolute level least 3 ng/mL ; Prior hormone treatment earlier episode PSA relapse neither exclusion inclusion requirement study entry . Patients previously treat adjuvant salvage radiation follow radical prostatectomy , either LHRHanalogue ( i.e. , leuprolide goserelin acetate ) nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy ( i.e. , bicalutamide 150 mg/day ) prior PSA relapse , may enter study provide : postprostatectomy PSA never &gt; 20 ng/mL ; PSA rise receive adequately dose hormonal therapy ; hormonal therapy receive , last effective day androgen deprivation least 6 month prior study entry ; Confirmed M0 ; bone scan evidence osseous metastasis must record , date within 6 month prior entry study ; Estimated lifeexpectancy , inclusive consideration comorbidities , least 1 year ; ECOG performance status 0 1 ; Ability understand trial procedure requirement ; Age &gt; 18 &lt; 80 year ; Ability understand , willingness sign , informed consent .</criteria>
