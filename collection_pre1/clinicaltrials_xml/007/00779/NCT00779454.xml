	<brief_summary>The purpose study partly continue good experience investigator chemotherapy partly optimize treatment inoperable cholangiocarcinoma add biological antibody treatment patient wild-type Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Biological Treatment Chemotherapy Patients With Inoperable Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholangiocarcinoma relatively rare disease . In Denmark approximately 150 patient diagnosed year . A small part patient offer surgery , operation rarely radical , patient cholangiocarcinoma therefore candidate chemotherapy . In Denmark combination therapy Gemcitabine , Oxaliplatin Capecitabine use recent year . Based experience gastrointestinal tumor , however , seem effect new biological substance , include EGFR antibody . There casuistic report specific effect monoclonal antibody EGFR cholangiocarcinoma . The effect EGF mediate intracellular pathway involve KRAS protein . It show mutation KRAS cause EGF system constantly activate . Effect patient KRAS mutation therefore expect . Approximately 50 % patient present mutation .</detailed_description>
