	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis severity asthma determine way airway smooth muscle cell grow release inflammatory mediator . Our main objective establish property airway smooth muscle cell varies asthma severity . Environmental agent , cigarette smoke , inflammation give rise oxidative stress - process whereby harmful chemical call free radical form body damage tissue . The damage cause limited/prevented protective , anti-oxidant mediator . We also look molecule involve oxidative stress may affect way airway smooth muscle grows produce inflammatory mediator .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims Objectives The objective study examine whether severity asthma relate ( possibly cause ) ASM dysfunction . Severe asthmatic show ASM bronchial biopsy non-severe asthmatics16 . Because ASM cell obtain bronchial biopsy obtain via bronchoscopy , examine endobronchial biopsy mild , moderate severe asthmatic , healthy non-asthmatic subject compare feature remodelling ( severe asthmatic subject assess Difficult Asthma Protocol Royal Brompton Hospital24 ) . In particular , focus ASM mass , proliferation change expression different contractile protein ( α-actin myosin ) chemokines , assess vitro response ASM cell stimulation TGF-β IL-1β . We also examine effect dexamethasone chemokine release induced proliferation vitro . We also study enzymes anti-oxidants involve oxidative stress , Nox4 , MnSOD catalase , look role regulate ASM cell proliferation chemokine synthesis . We want see oxidant-anti oxidant balance ASM severe asthma compare non-severe asthma . AIM : 1 . To establish difference ASM phenotype asthma patient differ severity disease term ASM mass , proliferation , migration chemokine release . Study design There 3 study visit . In first two visit , subject undergo spirometry reversibility testing , methacholine challenge test ( assess degree bronchial hyper-responsiveness ) , skin prick test IgE level ( assess atopic status ) , measurement exhale nitric oxide ( non-invasive marker inflammation ) , asthmatic subject complete Asthma Control Questionnaire Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire . The third visit day admission bronchoscopy . Study protocol : Visit 1 - screening visit - Explain purpose study- address queries/concerns - History examination - Skin prick test - Blood test full blood count , clot profile IgE - Measurement exhale nitric oxide ( eNO ) - Spirometry pre post β agonist - Completion Asthma Control Questionnaire - Completion Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire Visit 2 - Methacholine challenge test Visit 3 - Day admission fibreoptic bronchoscopy</detailed_description>
