	<brief_title>White Button Mushroom Extract Treating Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Local Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess feasibility toxicity prolong white button mushroom extract therapy six different dose level patient biochemically recurrent prostate cancer local therapy . Secondary - To analyze effect regimen variety biomarkers include testosterone , dihydrotestosterone , dehydroepiandrosterone , estrogens , aromatase , parameter immune function , circulate tumor cell . - To assess effect regimen PSA kinetics measure disease activity patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral white button mushroom extract twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood urine sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic , immunologic correlative study . Plasma urine sample analyze quantification conjugate unsaturated fatty acid via gas chromatography-mass spectometry . Plasma sample analyze inhibition aromatase via aromatase activity analysis effect treatment immune cytokine level via immunobiologic assay . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell analyzed effect treatment immune cell subset NK cell function via multi-parameter flow cytometry ; effect treatment NK cell activation status via stain method ; measurement circulate tumor cell via fluorescence microscopy , fiber-optic array scan technology ( FAST ) , high-speed flow cytometry . Additional serum sample collect future study . Patients complete diary listing day administration treatment side effect .</detailed_description>
