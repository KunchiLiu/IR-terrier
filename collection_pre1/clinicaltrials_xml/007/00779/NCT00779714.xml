	<brief_summary>This phase III trial aim investigate efficacy individualize , sensitivity-directed combination chemotherapy comparison standard regimen DTIC . Two question aim answered study : 1 . Is individual chemosensitivity index ( BICSI ) prognostic / predictive biomarker chemotherapy ? 2 . Is individualized , sensitivity-directed combination chemotherapy superior standard regimen DTIC term survival response ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Individualized Sensitivity-Directed Chemotherapy Versus DTIC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Melanoma cutaneous neoplasm know high aggressiveness , early dissemination metastasis , poor prognosis metastasize . Chemotherapy dacarbacine ( DTIC ) widely accept standard treatment metastatic melanoma , report response rate 10 % . This poor outcome assume due high chemoresistance intrinsic melanoma cell . However , therapeutic option like polychemotherapy , biochemotherapy , immunotherapy well targeted agent yet prove superior DTIC multicenter randomize study . Therefore , chemotherapy still consider main therapeutic option advance metastatic melanoma , number non-standard chemotherapeutics test small pilot study improve treatment efficacy . Even though complete remission metastatic lesion could observe patient , observation indicate subgroup patient exhibit high sensitivity certain anticancer drug . An vitro ATP-based chemosensitivity assay show differentiate chemosensitive chemoresistant melanoma patient . A phase-II-study testing assay 53 metastatic melanoma patient follow sensitivity-directed individualized chemotherapy demonstrate , chemosensitivity profile individual patient , reflect best individual chemosensitivity index ( BICSI ) , correlate therapy outcome term therapy response patient overall survival ( Ugurel S : Clin Cancer Res 2006 ) . Interestingly , surprisingly high proportion 2/5 investigated patient cohort classify chemosensitive , remain 3/5 classified chemoresistant . Objective response 36.4 % chemosensitive patient compare 16.1 % chemoresistant patient ( p=0.114 ) ; progression arrest ( CR+PR+SD ) 59.1 % versus 22.6 % ( p=0.01 ) . Chemosensitive patient show increased overall survival 14.6 month compare 7.4 month chemoresistant patient ( p=0.041 ) . These encouraging result prompt initiation randomize phase-III-trial investigate individualized sensitivity-directed combination chemotherapy compare current standard treatment DTIC , first-line treatment metastatic melanoma . The therapeutic chemosensitivity test treatment patient choose consider result phase-II-trial ( paclitaxel+cisplatinum , treosulfan+cytarabine ) .</detailed_description>
