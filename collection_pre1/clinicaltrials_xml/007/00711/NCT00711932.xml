	<brief_title>The Effect TRA-8 Ovarian Cancer Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer remain highly lethal , estimate 25,580 new case 16,090 death per year US . The common ovarian cancer arise surface epithelium ovary . Approximately 75 % patient advanced-stage cancer surgically incurable . While chemotherapy critical component treatment , pre-existing induce chemoresistance ovarian cancer cell major obstacle treatment patient advanced disease . Novel strategies enhance establish therapeutic Defective apoptosis propose one major mechanism lead malignant transformation resistance therapeutic . Defective apoptosis may result increased growth stimulation ( oncogene ) , decrease growth inhibition ( tumor suppressor gene ) imbalanced apoptosis regulation . Alterations Bcl-2 family protein report associated chemotherapy resistance ovarian cancer cell . ( 1 ) Increased anti-apoptosis protein , Bcl-XL , may play role prevent apoptosis ovarian cancer cell response chemotherapy . Conversely , high level pro-apoptosis protein , Bax , associate favorable response therapy . The role apoptotic regulatory protein sensitivity/resistance mechanism chemotherapy patient 's ovarian cancer cell begin elucidate . Precision cut tumor slice prepare fresh primary ovarian tumor specimen use Krumdieck tissue slicer , follow ex vivo TRA-8 cytotoxicity assay tumor slice . Tumor-derived tissue slice may use immediately short term assay need isolate expand tumor cell , thus avoid potential problem maintain cell viability select variant cell tumor dispersion long period vitro cell culture . Demonstration TRA-8-induced apoptosis use primary ovarian tumor ex vivo tumor slice cytotoxicity assay strengthen rationale therapy tumor type may use select patient would likely benefit TRA-8 therapy . The sensitivity ovarian patient tumor TRA-8 , paclitaxel , carboplatin evaluate tumor slice cytotoxicity assay single agent combination . Slices different treatment condition paraffin-embedded frozen immunohistochemical evaluation .</detailed_description>
