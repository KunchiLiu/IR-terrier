	<detailed_description>Eligible patient randomize one two different treatment group ( EPO HEXAL ERYPO ) 2:1 ratio . Patients receive double-blind treatment period 12 week . Following randomization patient treat subcutaneously dose 150 IU/kg body weight study drug three time per week . Dose adjustments 300 IU/kg body weight three time per week do hemoglobin ( Hb ) increase &lt; 1.0 g/dL reticulocyte count increase &lt; 40,000 /μl 4 week Hb increase &lt; 2.0 g/dL 8 week treatment . The primary endpoint Hb response EPO HEXAL group week 5-12 study define absolute increase Hb value 2.0 g/dL mean value screening/baseline period absence red blood cell transfusion precede 4 week . For purpose , Hb level measure weekly study visit central laboratory . Further parameter treatment efficacy , safety tolerability record .</detailed_description>
