	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give rituximab cyclophosphamide together bortezomib dexamethasone ( R-CyBor-D ) work treat patient relapsed refractory low-grade follicular lymphoma , Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia , mantle cell lymphoma . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving rituximab bortezomib together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess tumor response R-CyBor-D patient relapse follicular ( Gr 1 2 ) , mantle cell , marginal zone lymphoma , small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) /chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) lymphoplasmacytic ( Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia ) lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival , progression-free survival , duration response , time treatment failure patient receive R-CyBor-D. II . To describe adverse event profile ( use National Cancer Institute [ NCI ] Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] v 3.0 ) R-CyBor-D. III . To evaluate quality life patient report neurotoxicity use Gynecologic Oncology Group 's Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT/GOG ) neurotoxicity questionnaire , version 4.0 . OUTLINE : Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1and cyclophosphamide orally ( PO ) , bortezomib IV , dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
