	<brief_title>A Study To Investigate Safety , Blood Levels And Effects Of Giving GW642444 , By Mouth , By Inhalation &amp; By Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre , open-label , dose-ascending study 9 healthy male subject establish safe well tolerated systemic exposure safety margin GW642444 follow intravenous oral dose support future study . Additionally single inhale dose GW642444M administer provide data estimate inhale bioavailability GW642444 extent renal excretion follow dose via route . It plan administer four , dose-ascending , intravenous administration GW642444 treatment period 1 , 2 , 3 5 ; inhale dose would administer treatment period 4 oral dose treatment period 6 . The sequence treatment administration may alter required logistical reason , however dose intravenous oral GW642444 administer strictly dose ascend order . All intravenous dos administer infusion give constant rate 1 hour period .</detailed_description>
