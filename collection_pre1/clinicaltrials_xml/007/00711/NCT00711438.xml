	<detailed_description>The aim study test feasibility conduct pragmatic single-blinded fast track RCT BIS versus standard care patient COPD carers begin test effectiveness intervention : ( 1 ) Describing referral pattern activity service ; ( 2 ) Describing experience view service people breathlessness refer experience view informally involved care ; ( 3 ) Identifying aspect service useful people breathlessness , informally involve care health care professional . The study consist five component : ( 1 ) data relate referral pattern service activity ; ( 2 ) identification component intervention ; ( 3 ) pilot pragmatic fast-track randomise control trial ( RCT ) BIS COPD patient versus standard care ; ( 4 ) semi-structured interview referrers ; ( 5 ) in-depth interview BIS staff . The RCT describe . Although BIS also receive referral patient cancer heart failure , COPD patient make large diagnostic group referral . The pilot trial therefore focus heterogeneous cohort COPD/COAD patient . The investigator blind allocation respondent week 8 . This achieve investigator conduct recruitment study collect baseline measure , pass process randomisation report allocation ( patient provider ) third party ( clinical trial ' nurse ) use random sequence opaque envelop previously generate study administrator King 's ( independent service RCT ) . Subsequent , data handle use study identity number group allocation identifier add analysis stage . Outcomes self-assessed patient carers principally use structure questionnaire also incorporate qualitative topic guide prior randomisation end fast track group 's exposure BIS control group 's wait period BIS ( measurement point structure questionnaire complete prior qualitative interview ) . Subsequent data collect control group receipt BIS ( period wait list group allocation blind investigator ) treat before/after data RCT data . This allow collection qualitative data midpoint use service investigator longer blind group allocation , require stage . Measurement point : 'measures ' ( quantitative qualitative ) take respondent ( FT CC ) baseline ( t1 ) , prior randomisation . They repeat fast-track group ( FC ) intervention ( 4 week post commencement intervention ( FTt2 ) - quantitative ) control condition group time ( CCt2 - quantitative ) , discharge fast track group ( 8 week post commencement intervention ( FTt3 ) ) . As well measure t1 ( randomisation ) t2 ( mid-point randomisation intervention - quantitative ) , control condition group ( CC ) also measure prior commencement intervention ( CCt3 ) , repeat intervention ( 4 week post commencement intervention ( CCt4 ) ) discharge ( 8 week post commencement intervention ( CCt5 ) ) . Using measurement strategy make possible identify whether condition respondent control group deteriorate whilst await intervention whether impact final outcome group . Measures collect mean audio-taped structured/semi-structured interview ( respondent ' permission ) . It propose measurement point patient carers interview separately find important pilot study interview . This manage mean request carers complete self-complete measure whilst interview conduct patient . Interviews carers conduct separate , temporally close , occasion ( e.g . 2 day later ) , carer 's convenience ( e.g . evening require ) . Careful attention pay needs patient carer term fatigue . Determining sample size pilot/exploratory trial type difficult . As trial conduct particular intervention , type intervention patient group ( i.e . COPD patient ) , lack data ( e.g . identification primary outcome measure data ) support power calculation usually use estimate require sample size definitive RCT ( i.e . number participant need ensure study scientifically sound ) . In addition , trial exist relate intervention patient COPD ( e.g . trial pulmonary rehabilitation rather breathlessness intervention service ) focus primarily physiological outcome clinical measure breathlessness . However , result earlier work Pre-Clinical phase Phase I , become aware need look beyond physiological measure consider outcome ( e.g . distress due breathlessness , ability choose participate social event ) . Thus pilot/exploratory trial ( Phase II ) provide vital information inform power calculation future plan definitive RCT ( Phase III ) . The aims current pilot/exploratory trial therefore include test intervention ( BIS ) also establish feasibility conduct definitive RCT test trial method ( i.e . pragmatic fast-track design ) , randomisation procedure identification appropriate primary outcome measure . It envisage likely primary patient outcomes 'distress due breathlessness ' mastery breathlessness ; likely primary carer outcome 'carer distress due breathlessness ' . For patient carers 'distress due breathlessness ' measure use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ; 0-10cm ) ; difference baseline follow measurement 1cm scale could regard clinically significant patient intractable breathlessness . This pilot/exploratory RCT provide data confirm refute outcome , enhance design future definitive trial . Based clinical experience , data publish study case report ( e.g . Corner et al , 1996 ) , expert advice , make tentative estimate likely change may expect intervention . We could expect change score severe distress due breathlessness 2.2 ( SD 1.8 ) 10 point scale . This difference would detect , use Mann Whitney U test , 11 patient group ( 22 total ) , 80 % power significance p=0.05 . A change proportion patient severe severe distress due breathlessness 90 % 40 % would detect 80 % power significance p &lt; 0.05 14 patient group ( 28 patient total ) . Therefore aim recruit least 30 ( 28 ) patient trial . A number subjective measure , exercise tolerance measure physiological measure already collect record BIS ( e.g . VAS , modify BORG , MRC grade dyspnoea symptom etc. ) . These continue collect utilised service evaluation . In accordance aim evaluation , outcome assess within trial relate patient carer satisfaction service , patient carer quality life , patient carer anxiety , patient mastery , caregiver burden , patient ' breathlessness , patient carer distress due breathlessness , aspects service useful user ( patient carers ) service use .</detailed_description>
