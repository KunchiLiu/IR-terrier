	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Magnetic Stimulation Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite utility modern psychotropic medication , depression remain medical problem major societal impact . Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) effective somatic treatment depression . However , ECT disadvantage , include risk attendant general anesthesia significant cognitive side effect ( e.g . confusion memory loss ) . An effective safer somatic therapy depression could help many patient . The brain stimulate non-invasively use time-varying magnetic field induce electrical current within cerebral cortex , technique know transcranial magnetic stimulation . Preliminary investigation provide promising evidence improve mood associate high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) leave prefrontal cortex patient medication-resistant major depression . However , role stimulus laterality effect prefrontal rTMS test systematically . Furthermore , previous study likely confound inadequate patient blind lack standardization psychotropic medication treatment . Therefore , propose use carefully control clinical trial directly test hypothesis effect prefrontal rTMS mood relate laterality magnetic stimulation . We also intend improve blind comparison previous study : 1 ) employ parallel-group study design compare real simulated rTMS , oppose crossover study design ; 2 ) use specially construct sham magnetic coil place directly scalp surface , effectively simulate rTMS ; 3 ) use train weak electrical impulse simulate cutaneous scalp stimulation associate rTMS . We minimize confound effect medication antidepressant withdrawal : 1 ) require patient fail monitor clinical trial SSRI comparable antidepressant prior rTMS ; 2 ) continue pharmacological treatment depression rTMS phase trial . Demonstration therapeutic efficacy rTMS rigorously control clinical trial would provide foundation investigation development novel potential treatment modality .</detailed_description>
