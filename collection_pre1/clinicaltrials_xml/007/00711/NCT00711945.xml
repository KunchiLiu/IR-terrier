	<brief_summary>Pediatric Crohn 's Disease life long disease , present early life.As , imperative able evaluate risk severe disease poorer outcomes make decision therapy offer patient . These decision base accord longer-term disease outcome , whether prevent disease relapse prolong remission [ 10-12 ] . However , part , previous study design yield predictive parameter could allow clinician differentiate patient high risk relapse , likely serious attack complication disease therapy . The ability predict risk would impact dramatically way CD patient treat , allow clinician tailor therapy , type intensity , patient 's individual risk relapse outcomes.In present first phase study , attempt identify factor predict relapse disease , focus use calprotectin onset clinical remission , use anti-glycan antibody , well disease severity , site phenotype .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposal describe first prospective large pediatric cohort study design look simultaneously , disease onset , clinical , inflammatory , serological therapeutic parameter CD , standardize treatment regimens long-term follow-up . The exploratory study delineate whether sub-clinical inflammatory parameter ( calprotectin ) , perform post-treatment achieve remission , indeed predictive time relapse relapse rate . We anticipate patient low calprotectin level significantly less likely relapse follow-up period , patient persistent inflammation induction remission ( high calprotectin level ) likely relapse early . We also evaluate relationship various clinical sub-clinical parameter CD disease outcomes , well influence treatment parameter . Greater knowledge relationship inflammatory serological marker , treatment choose , CD outcome improve disease control clinic may offer insight clinician modify course CD . Furthermore , study answer follow question : patient clinical improvement ongoing inflammation , treat accord clinical symptom treat accord sub-clinical laboratory data ? Finally , without industry bias , study may offer ultimately ability model factor predictive poor outcome , compare long-term benefit hazard treatment use today . The framework propose study development prospectively incident cohort ~300 +/- 30 newly diagnose case CD period two year team pediatric gastroenterologist represent approximately 20 European IBD center ( ESPGHAN 'Porto ' group ) . Multiple clinical laboratory parameter record serially interval standardize , pre-agreed format , initial presentation subsequent 18 month . At initial presentation , IBD clinic confirm independently diagnosis CD , oppose inflammatory bowel condition , accord Porto criterion . These newly diagnose untreated pediatric patient CD must age 18 . Exclusion criterion include abdominal surgery , pregnancy indeterminate colitis . All participate center file IRB within organization . Consent seek patient patient 's guardian document native language . Participation study entail novel therapeutic intervention , pose risk patient . Most data collect study collect routinely care CD pediatric patient , although extra blood stool sample take . Since standard take blood test visit , example assess disease activity presence anemia complication , anticipate blood draw inhibit participation . Therefore , predict almost eligible patient ( 80 % ) present 'Porto ' group center enrol study . At visit , clinician evaluate record location disease , height weight , well disease activity ( Pediatric Crohn 's Disease Activity Index , PCDAI ; CRP . A stool sample take visit assess fecal calprotectin ( measure intestinal inflammation . Any disease complication , fistula , abscess stricture also note well type ( ) treatment administer . There 6 predetermine standard visit 0 , 8 , 12 , 26 , 52 78 week . Blood drawn 0 , 8 , 12 52 week . Serum obtain blood sample divide frozen minus 20 degree centigrade center . These serum transport 'Hub ' center ( select ) , store long-term ; shall transfer party . These sample use serotype serological marker gASCA , pANCA , ACCA , ALCA AMCA ( serology profile ) . . All participate gastroenterologist agree standardized treatment regimen employ possible standardized follow-up protocol . The regimen protocol define meet hold Porto June 2005 validate meet hold Porto March 2007 . Use standardized regimen remove treatment variability possible bias confound factor disease outcome analysis . Institution second treatment , due relapse lack response , register use standardized relapse/lack response form . In general , multivariate statistical analysis employ search significant correlation inflammatory serological parameter disease outcome .</detailed_description>
