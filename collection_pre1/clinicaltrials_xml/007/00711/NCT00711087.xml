	<brief_title>Botox-A Injection Improve Bladder Function Early Spinal Cord Injury ( # H-20344 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 10,000 spinal cord injury ( SCI ) occur year , occur male ( 80 % ) . Many patient develop neurogenic bladder dysfunction ( NGB ) characterize overactivity detrusor muscle , term detrusor overactivity ( DO ) detrusor hyperreflexia ( DH ) . They also develop detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia ( DESD ) , abnormal/ uncoordinated response sphincter bladder contraction . A combination factor lead long-term complication 50 % patient . These complication include hydronephrosis , autonomic dysreflexia , vesicoureteral reflux , nephrolithiasis , sepsis , renal insufficiency failure even death . Our basic understanding physiology NGB well introduction concept clean intermittent catheterization ( CIC ) several decade ago significantly reduce death rate due renal complication SCI patient . Nevertheless , continue significant amount morbidity risk patient experience due incomplete understanding DESD ; development subsequent impact bladder function . We postulate primary drive produce detrusor hypercontractility obstruction create increase tone within external urethral sphincter ( EUS ) . In addition , hypothesize high-pressure obstructive voiding pattern display patient DESD promote development bladder wall smooth muscle hypertrophy fibrosis , loss bladder compliance , development complication list . Most treatment option neurogenic bladder SCI patient population aim reduce bladder filling pressure obstructive void pattern either reduce bladder overactivity ( i.e . antimuscarinic agent ) decrease bladder outlet resistance ( i..e. alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist , sphincterotomy , UroLume stent placement , botulinum toxin injection external urethral sphincter ) . However , typically treatment initiate reflex voiding pattern already develop . Almost patient supraconal lesion , regardless neurological level injury final voiding pattern , display areflexic bladder acute subacute time period SCI . This time period last anywhere 1 month 1 year ( typically 6-8 week ) spinal reflex void develops . Dyssynergic void pattern common cervical thoracic ( supraconal ) lesion flexic void pattern predominate lumbar sacral conal infraconal injury . However , many exception rule , especially incomplete lesion , urodynamic test important component evaluation every SCI patient . Nerve Growth Factor ( NGF ) : Role Obstructive Uropathy : The process lead reorganization neural pathway emergence hyperactive dyssynergic void incompletely understood . Possible mechanisms underlying neural plasticity follow SCI could involve alteration level neurotrophic factor within bladder . Nerve Growth Factor ( NGF ) signal protein think play prominent role mediate development bladder reflex void mechanism various disorder bladder dysfunction include neurogenic non-neurogenic bladder outlet obstruction chronic bladder inflammation ( i.e . interstitial cystitis ) . Studies find inhibit NGF 's action immunization , enhancement bladder hyperactivity detrusor sphincter dyssynergia prevent SCI rat . Finally , study SCI human patient find bladder hyperactivity well bladder NGF tissue level significantly reduce bladder BTX-A treatment . BOTOX® ( Botulinum Toxin Type A ) Purified Neurotoxin Complex sterile , vacuum-dried purify botulinum toxin type A , produce fermentation Hall strain Clostridium botulinum type A grown medium contain casein hydrolysate , glucose yeast extract . It purify culture solution dialysis series acid precipitation complex consist neurotoxin , several accessory protein . The complex dissolve sterile sodium chloride solution contain Albumin Human sterile filter ( 0.2 micron ) prior fill vacuum-drying . One Unit BOTOX correspond calculated median intraperitoneal lethal dose ( LD50 ) mouse . The method utilized performing assay specific Allergan 's product , BOTOX® . Due specific detail assay vehicle , dilution scheme laboratory protocols various mouse LD50 assay , Units biological activity BOTOX compare convert Units botulinum toxin toxin assess specific assay method . Therefore , difference species sensitivity different botulinum neurotoxin serotypes precludes BOTOX approximately 20 units/nanogram neurotoxin protein complex . Each vial BOTOX contain 100 Units ( U ) Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin complex , 0.5 milligram Albumin Human , 0.9 milligram sodium chloride sterile , vacuum-dried form without preservative . Botulinum Toxin ( BTX-A ) treat DESD : Botulinum toxin , first isolated van Ermengem 1897 , potent biological toxin know man . Through basic clinical research , clinicians able transform lethal toxin health benefit . BTX-A represent viable option treatment DESD . When injected , toxin act neuromuscular junction external sphincter block vesicle transport acetylcholine ; essence , produce chemical denervation . The clinical effect begin within 2-3 day reversible terminal nerve sprout occurs within 3-6 month . The majority study DESD examine several outcome measure follow BTX-A injection : Change post-void residual ( PVR ) , change urethral pressure profile ( UPP-static dynamic ) , change bladder pressure void , change frequency severity autonomic dysreflexia ( AD ) , change symptom satisfaction procedure patient . Once , BTX-A treat patient ' demonstrated improvement PVR UPP similar previous study . However , study BTX-A DESD document significant reduction detrusor urethral pressure well PVR , prior research show detrusor leak point pressure ( DLPP ) best prognostic measure upper tract damage neurogenic bladder patient . This fundamental concept corroborate external sphincterotomy study demonstrate failure achieve DLPP 40 cm H2O increase frequency upper tract deterioration . This finding underscore importance future study examine efficacy BTX treatment DESD utilize DLPP objective measure procedure 's success . Preliminary Data : Effect BTX-A Urethral Outlet Resistance Measuring Changes Leak Point Pressure . The purpose investigation evaluate effect BTX-A vivo urethral resistance measure leak point pressure ( LPP ) vertical tilt table intravesical pressure clamp . Female SD rat ( n=8 ; 220-250g ) anesthetize urethane ( 1.2 g/kg ) inject intraperitoneally either BTX-A ( 100u ) saline 18 hour prior experimentation . LPP record administration nicotinic receptor antagonist -bungarotoxin ( BGT ) , ganglionic blocker hexamethonium ( HEX ) . BGT significantly decrease LPP control animals 46 % appreciable affect BTX-A treat animal . In comparison , BTX-A treatment decrease LPP 47 % compare baseline value control animal . The ganglionic blocker , HEX , appreciable effect either control BTX-A treat animal . BTX-A significantly decrease basal LPP extent BGT , confirm 's vivo potency striate neuromuscular junction . However , fact HEX appreciable effect either group suggest sympathetic tone prominent component outlet resistance female rat , may suitable vivo model describe effect BTX-A urethral adrenergic pathway . Although originally design method evaluate stress urinary incontinence rodent , method actually measure intravesical pressure bladder fill urinary leakage occurs , , detrusor leak point pressure ( DLPP ) . The marked decrease DLPP induce BTX-A animal model validate BTX-A 's potential effect DLPP human DESD . BTX-A Urethral Sphincter Injections Humans : Sixty eight patient receive urethral sphincter injection bladder outlet obstruction result DESD pelvic floor spasticity . Patients ' mean age 53 ( range 21-71 ) underlie pathophysiology outlet obstruction include : spinal cord injury ( n=9 ) , multiple sclerosis ( n=32 ) , stroke ( n=4 ) , ( n=8 ) , idiopathic retention/pelvic floor spasticity ( n=15 ) . Patients inject 100 unit BTX-A external urethral sphincter local general anesthesia . Postoperatively , significant decrease maximal detrusor pressure ( 81cm 52cm H2O , p &lt; 0.05 ) post-void residual ( 240ml 88ml , p &lt; 0.05 ) observe beneficial effect last 3-4 month . Significance : The significance experiment begin fact propose intervention occur early spinal cord injury ( i.e . within 8 week ) pathologic bladder reflex pathway emerge . In addition , propose project would : 1 . The large , prospective randomize trial examine effect BTX-A urethral sphincter injection detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia ( DESD ) first look effect BTX-A detrusor leak point pressure ( DLPP ) ; 2 . The first study evaluate role bladder outlet obstruction DESD play development bladder hyperactivity development complication result bladder dysfunction ; 3 . The first study profile bladder tissue level signal protein nerve growth factor ( NGF ) early SCI bladder hyperreflexic pattern develop , ; 4 . The first study evaluate effect reduce outlet resistance BTX-A bladder NGF level . If hypothesis prove correct , treat patient display less incontinence , require low dos anticholinergic medication , avoid complication DESD list early proposal . Although study write moderate length ( i.e . total 5 year ) , hope find significant result able capture longitudinal history population extend follow-up long duration ( i.e . &gt; 10 year ) . In addition , BTX-A treatment could extend neurogenic population suffer DESD ( i.e . Multiple Sclerosis ) well condition bladder overactivity appear driven outlet obstruction ( i.e . Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ) . Hypotheses : 1 . BTX-A injection external urethral sphincter significantly decrease detrusor leak point pressure ( DLPP ) . 2 . Decreased DLPP early SCI markedly reduce bladder tissue nerve growth factor ( NGF ) . 3 . Reducing DLPP bladder NGF early SCI diminish complication associate neurogenic detrusor overactivity ( NDO ) outlet obstruction .</detailed_description>
