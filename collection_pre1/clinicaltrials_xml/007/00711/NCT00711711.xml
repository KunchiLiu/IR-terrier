	<brief_title>Manual Lymphatic Drainage Following Total Knee Arthroplasty Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background There scientific evidence rehabilitation positive influence patients'recovery total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . According literature , conventional rehabilitation aim improve knee range motion , low limb strength , gait , activity pain . Although swell systematic consequence TKA surgery , less focus put swell reduction . Patients develop swell due periarticular edema , hematoma joint effusion . Inflammation , pain , stiffness , alteration gait pattern , quadriceps contraction inhibition slow rehabilitation report consequence swell . Accordingly , likely therapy would promote resorption swell would decrease negative impact swell patients'recovery . Manual lymph drainage ( MLD ) could possibly accelerate edema resorption TKA surgery . Several author advise MLD TKA , physiotherapists currently apply MLD reduce postsurgical swelling . Its positive effect chronic lymphedema resorption largely accept . Results pain range motion seem interesting empirical point view , knowledge , scientifically driven study confirm positive effect orthopaedic surgery . Aim This study aim evaluate effect MLD swelling , parameter possibly influence swell ( pain , knee range motion , knee objective subjective function gait pattern ) . Methods This study randomize controlled clinical trial . Patients blind goal treatment evaluator blind treatment deliver patient . The effect MLD ( 5 treatment 30 minute second eighth postsurgical day ) compare placebo ( relaxation session ) . MLD placebo add conventional rehabilitation program Orthopaedic Department . Assessments conduct one day surgery , two day , 8 day 3 month surgery . Evolution difference group statistically assessed step . Significance This project aim improve knowledge efficiency rehabilitation treatment follow TKA . It contribute effective evaluation effect widely apply treatment . The result help physiotherapists medical doctor take clinical decision base documented evidence . This make contribution well quality care well allocation resource rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
