	<detailed_description>Sepsis common cause ARF ICU . In last 50 year significant advance understand pathogenesis , prevention treatment septic ARF , except use renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) establish . It assume hypotension induce severe sepsis result organ hypoperfusion subsequent kidney ischaemia . This ischaemia believe one main factor , principal factor , contribute development ARF severe sepsis . Surprisingly , little evidence support assumption . Rather , emerge evidence seriously question traditional ischaemic-acute tubular necrosis ( ATN ) paradigm septic ARF . Patients severe sepsis find increase , rather decrease , renal blood flow , post mortem examination kidney patient die septic acute renal failure rarely show appearance ATN . An animal model septic ARF find renal blood flow increase , glomerular filtration rate decrease . These fact lead u hypothesise profound efferent arteriolar vasodilatation may cause observed decrease GFR septic ARF . The logical explanation observation RBF increase GFR fall efferent afferent arteriole dilate , efferent vasodilation great . A selective efferent arteriolar vasoconstrictor would expect restore GFR . Angiotensin II selective know efferent vasoconstrictor . We hypothesise early therapeutic intervention angiotensin II critically ill patient severe sepsis/septic shock kidney dysfunction may improve kidney function need renal replacement therapy avoid . This would represent significant improvement care critically ill patient severe sepsis/septic shock ARF , condition intervention short RRT show improve outcome . Novel successful therapeutic intervention patient population would widespread clinical implication , include improve survival less need long-term dialysis , consequent resource saving .</detailed_description>
