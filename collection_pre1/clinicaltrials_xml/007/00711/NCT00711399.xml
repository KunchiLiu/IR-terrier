	<brief_title>Assessment Cough Wheeze With Breath Sound Documenting Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical background Respiratory wheeze characteristic symptom asthma obstructive disease . The wheezes heard chest surface trachea use stethoscope listen near person 's mouth . The wheezes part Continuous Adventitious Breath Sounds ( CABS ) family , addition wheeze , rhonchus whistle also part family . Each breath sound unique characteristic indicate presence airway obstruction . Reducing obstruction bronco dilator , example , lower amount wheeze ; mean lower time period breathe wheeze present . Cough part defense mechanism protect lung foreign particle remove secretion airway . However , time become bothersome , annoy symptom interferes quality life , sleep pattern exercise tolerance patient . Children respiratory infection , asthmatic child CF patient suffer multitude pathology airway often inflict chronic cough . Recently breakthrough continuous monitor respiratory symptom introduce . The Wheezing Infant Monitor ( WIM ) technology utilizes flat coin shape microphone attach chest trachea allow continuous record breath sound absorbed microphone . This innovative technology provide objective assessment duration , intensity time respiratory symptom computerize processing data . Study background The study title 'Use objective cough count breath sound document device , assess severity duration cough wheeze child adult suffer acute chronic respiratory disease ' . The study goal create database respiratory sound recording , evaluate validate WIM technology evaluate efficacy specific treatment compare severity respiratory symptom administration treatment . The study open study . Each patient evaluate twice day hospitalization . Each record session last one hour include 10 minute pre treatment recording , administration treatment continuation record . The patient treat accord his/her condition record delay administration treatment urgent case . The study population consist child respiratory infection , asthmatic child CF patient suffer respiratory symptom cough and/or shortness breath . The study population include approximately 200 patient . Patients cough , wheeze shortness breath patient ( parents/guardians ) give consent participate study include . Subjects respiratory distress , skin lesion preclude attachment sensor , subject chest tube pregnant woman exclude study .</detailed_description>
