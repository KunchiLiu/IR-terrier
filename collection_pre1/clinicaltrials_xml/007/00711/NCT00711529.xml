	<brief_summary>Premenopausal woman breast cancer receive endocrine therapy ( e.g . tamoxifen ) and/or chemotherapy risk experience premature menopause treatment . The result symptom , notably hot flash , cause significant detriment patient 's quality life . Treatment menopausal symptom gold standard hormone replacement therapy do routinely unclear whether increase risk tumor recurrence . In addition , many medical oncologist feel contraindicated population , especially among woman whose breast cancer estrogen receptor . This lead increase interest option estrogen replacement treatment hot flash , though investigation alternative medication show suboptimal response . Recent study suggest non-drug treatment use alternative complementary therapy may effective . Specifically , hypnosis promote mean control hot flash , though test randomized fashion . In accordance National Cancer Institute 's recent initiative expand goal clinical trial include symptom management study , purpose evaluate role complementary alternative therapy improvement symptom woman breast cancer . Specifically , plan evaluate use hypnotherapy treatment therapy-induced hot flash breast cancer survivor . We intend recruit 60 woman pilot feasibility trial compare hypnotherapy drug gabapentin ( Neurontin® ) treatment therapy-induced hot flash eligible woman receive care Breast Health Center . We choose gabapentin base recent study show may effective non-estrogen treatment indication . We identify patient experience least one daily hot flash result treatment receive breast cancer participation . When enrol , randomize either treatment arm , receive daily gabapentin , experimental arm , undergo weekly hypnotherapy . Our study hypothesis hypnotherapy effective gabapentin control hot flash population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Comparing Hypnotherapy Gabapentin Hot Flashes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Roughly half woman diagnose pre-menopausal breast cancer hormone receptor-positive tumor , make candidate anti-estrogen therapy . Both endocrine therapy ovarian ablation also show improve outcome population . Hot flash frequent side effect woman receive anti-estrogen therapy breast cancer , show significant impact patient ' quality life . For example , report hot flash breast cancer survivor severe result significant impact quality life measure compare healthy woman . Hormone replacement , gold standard treatment hot flash postmenopausal woman , contraindicate population . Non-hormonal drug therapy explore treatment hot flash population woman moderate result . In randomized controlled trial , venlafaxine show reduce self-reported hot flash patient breast cancer 25-61 % . However , selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) selective norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor ( SNRIs ) may interfere metabolism tamoxifen , common treatment estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer , inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) enzyme . Gabapentin gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) analogue commonly use treatment seizure disorder neuropathic pain . There evidence demonstrate efficacy hot flash equivalent estrogen superior antidepressant postmenopausal woman . In pilot study 22 woman breast cancer tamoxifen , use gabapentin four week reduce frequency hot flash 44.2 % , decrease hot flash severity score 52.6 % . These result confirm large study 420 breast cancer survivor randomize receive gabapentin 300mg/d , gabapentin 900mg/d , placebo . The 900mg/d dose gabapentin effective ; decrease frequency hot flash 49 % four week . In group receive 900mg gabapentin daily , 12 % withdrawal rate 4 week , 17 % 8 week , owe side effect subjective inefficacy . Hypnosis hypnotherapy , define induction deeply relaxed condition allow patient suspend critical faculty allow suggestibility , show effective reduce daily frequency hot flash ( 59 % ) , also improve quality life variable insomnia patient breast cancer . However , therapy never compare directly pharmacotherapy treatment therapy-induced hot flash patient breast cancer . In response NCI 's 2006 initiative expand goal clinical trial include symptom management study , interested evaluate role complementary alternative therapy improvement symptom woman breast cancer . This trial determine whether hypnotherapy , administer standard way , improve frequency hot flash breast cancer specific quality life woman diagnose pre-menopausal breast cancer . We propose evaluate pilot feasibility study randomize participant eight week course gabapentin hypnosis .</detailed_description>
