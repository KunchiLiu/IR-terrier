	<detailed_description>`` This study focus document final parameter change make comparison IBP recommendation specific cardiovascular arrhythmia history . It therefore compare device setting finally program last available follow procedure last available parameter recommendation IBP . IBP design facilitate programming provide customized parameter setting base patient 's clinical need primary indication . In order enhance IBP feature future device generation , additional data may collect evaluate : - Physician perception satisfaction New User Interface ( NUI ) program application ; - Motivation adapt IBP recommendation final programming device ; - Device data retrieve patient data disk may include limited , arrhythmia episode detail , pace counter data ; total individual therapy data ''</detailed_description>
