	<brief_summary>This study design assess safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) preliminary efficacy DTA-H19 administer intratumorally patient unresectable , locally advanced pancreatic cancer . Primary Objective : The primary objective determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) intratumoral DTA-H19 identify dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) . Secondary objective include determine adverse event ( AEs ) profile , effect clinical laboratory analytes , vital sign , PK , tumor response , possible tumor resectability 4 intratumoral administration DTA-H19 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DTA-H19 , double strand DNA plasmid carry gene diphtheria toxn A ( DT-A ) chain regulation H19 promoter sequence . This Patient-Oriented , Targeted Therapy DT-A chain expression trigger presence H19 transcription factor upregulated tumor cell . The selective initiation toxin expression result selective tumor cell destruction via inhibition protein synthesis tumor cell , enable highly targeted cancer treatment .</detailed_description>
