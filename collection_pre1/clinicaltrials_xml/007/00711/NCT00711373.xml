	<detailed_description>At Christine M. Kleinert Institute Louisville , Kentucky , recruit patient research protocol underway Composite Tissue Allotransplantation Hand . This study upper extremity injury , possibility . The Hand Surgeons Kleinert , Kutz Associates Christine M. Kleinert Institute perform first hand transplant United States . This patient well , almost 15 year post transplant . We also transplant seven recipient , include bilateral recipient . For information visit www.handtransplant.com . While hand transplantation viable option select upper extremity amputee , significant risk must understand patient decide whether hand transplantation right option . The major risk systemic immunosuppression current hand transplant recipient must take . As part clinical trial hand transplanation also offer sub-study sub study determine cell isolate fat tissue use control immune response graft . This population cell isolate fat tissue call stromal vascular fraction ( SVF ) use experimental basis patient problem blood vessel leg , patient receive bone marrow transplant , patient Chron 's disease . These trial also experimental . To date , case SVF cell isolate used patient associate harmful side effect . In optional sub-study SVF isolate patient 's fat tissue would inject graft time transplant , time rejection episode . We hope cell help hand nerve heal , help control immune system response donor hand . However , experimental study n't know work . After transplant injection SVF cell follow treated hand transplant recipient clinical trial . This sub-study optional . Subjects choose participate sub-study still able participate hand transplant clinical trial .</detailed_description>
