	<brief_summary>Patients schizophrenia problem think , know cognitive dysfunction . This include many type cognitive dysfunction , attention , memory language . These problem may explain patient schizophrenia think act unusual way , often problem manage aspect live healthy adult take grant . Unfortunately , biochemical aspect dysfunction presently unknown , clear whether current psychiatric medication improve function . A recent FDA-approved medication may improve function modafinil . Studies animals healthy adult show medication improve many cognitive function . We plan study effect modafinil cognitive process , give various dos medication patient perform task cognitive process . We also enroll healthy adult procedure order determine effect manifest normal-range cognitive function . We predict patient control participant receive modafinil , perform well cognitive test , benefit depend dose give .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose-response Study Modafinil Effects Cognition Healthy Adults Schizophrenia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia disorder cognition . The cognitive deficit schizophrenia present onset disorder , prior medication exposure , persistent period remission , strongly related functional outcome . These deficit prominently include prefrontal cortex-dependent function . While exist medication effectively treat psychotic symptom , exhibit modest benefit best cognitive dysfunction . Studies cognition animal model indicate neurotransmitter system mediate many cognitive process generally augment exist antipsychotic medication . Therefore , advance treatment schizophrenia require study agent novel pharmacological profile establish potential remediate cognitive dysfunction . This study evaluate effect modafinil range cognitive process know disturbed schizophrenia . Modafinil FDA-approved medication unique pharmacological profile increase range off-label indication . Its neurochemical effect animal model include elevation extracellular dopamine ( DA ) , noradrenaline ( NA ) glutamate neocortex . This profile favorable enhancement cognitive process . These neurochemical effect also appear selective cortical versus subcortical brain region , suggest modafinil may minimal effect psychotic symptom , extrapyramidal , autonomic hormonal side effect . In addition , differs amphetamine structure , neurochemical profile behavioral effect , low risk addictive cerebrovascular effect . Recent study animal model , healthy adult adult psychiatric neurological disorder indicate modafinil improves prefrontal cognitive function . This suggest modafinil lead candidate treatment cognitive dysfunction schizophrenia . We aim test modafinil effect process healthy adult , order evaluate modafinil effect normal-range cognition , evaluate remediation deficit function individual schizophrenia . We vary dose within participant evaluate dose-response relationship , directly compare cognition outcome measure sensitivity drug effect .</detailed_description>
