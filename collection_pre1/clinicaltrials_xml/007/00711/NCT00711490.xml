	<brief_summary>Objective : Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) frequent manifestation diabetic retinopathy , lead cause blindness United States . The proven treatment DME laser photocoagulation . Sirolimus show inhibit production , signal activity many growth factor relevant development diabetic retinopathy . Therefore , study investigate safety efficacy multiple sirolimus injection patient DME . Study Population : Eligibility criterion include central macular thicken &gt; 260 micron visual acuity 20/32 bad one eye . Design : Five participant enrol open-label pilot study . After receive 20 μL ( 440 μg ) subconjunctival injection study eye baseline Month 2 , participant re-evaluated every two month least one year possible additional injection . During follow-up , participant undergo re-injection show significant clinical improvement treatment success , define intraretinal fluid cyst present optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) OR 100 % reduction excess retinal thickness 260 micron OCT OR leakage fluorescein angiography ( FA ) . Beginning Month 4 , participant assess treatment failure , define loss 15 letter vision compare baseline two consecutive visit OR 50 % great increase total retinal thickness measure OCT two consecutive visit . Individual participant deem treatment failure continue receive sirolimus injection , allow receive focal laser therapy amenable leak microaneurysms Month 4 . Beginning Month 6 , focal laser therapy permit treatment failure participant meet criterion treatment success . Participants option continue treatment common termination date one year . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome change visual acuity study eye six month compare baseline . Secondary outcome include change visual acuity study eye one year compare baseline , change retinal thickness measure OCT change fluid leakage macula demonstrate FA six month , one year throughout study period study fellow eye . Safety outcomes include number severity systemic ocular toxicity , adverse event infection , number participant withdraw study therapy .</brief_summary>

Able willing provide inform consent . 5 . Both female participant childbearing potential male participant able father child must agree practice two* form adequate birth control throughout course study three month follow completion study treatment . Acceptable method birth control include hormonal contraception ( birth control pill , inject hormone vaginal ring ) , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicide ( diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide ) surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , tubal ligation vasectomy ) . *Participants hysterectomy vasectomy ( partner hysterectomy vasectomy ) exempt use two method contraception . However , female participant tubal ligation ( male participant female partner tubal ligation ) exempt , require practice another acceptable method birth control . 6 . Female participant childbearing potential must willing undergo pregnancy test duration study . 7 . At least one eye meet study eye criterion list Section 4.2 . ParticipantLevel Exclusion Criteria 1 . History chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . 2 . Positive serum urine pregnancy test currently lactate woman childbearing potential . 3 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . 4 . Participation investigational trial within 30 day study entry involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval time study entry . 5 . History cancer ( nonmelanoma skin cancer ) diagnose within past five year could worsen immunosuppression . * *The risk immunosuppression must determine oncology consultation prior enrollment . 6 . Laboratory value outside normal limit consider clinically significant investigator . 7 . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . 8 . History intravitreal antiVEGF therapy subtenon/intravitreal steroid either eye within three month prior study entry . 9 . History treatment systemic antiVEGF agent steroid within one year prior study entry . 10 . Participant currently take one follow drug : amprenavir , atazanavir , clarithromycin , darunavir , delavirdine , erythromycin , fluconazole ( dose 200mg great ) , fluvoxamine , indinavir , itraconazole , ketoconazole , nefazodone , nelfinavir , posaconazole , quinupristin , ritonavir , saquinavir , telithromycin , troleandomycin , verapamil voriconazole . Study Eye Inclusion Criteria 1 . Bestcorrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual acuity score ≤ 74 letter ( i.e. , 20/32 bad ) . 2 . Definite retinal thickening due diabetic macular edema base clinical exam involve center macula refractory therapy base investigator 's clinical judgment . 3 . Retinal thickness baseline OCT measurement &gt; 260 micron central subfield . 4 . Media clarity , pupillary dilation patient cooperation sufficient adequate fundus photograph . Study Eye Exclusion Criteria 1 . Macular edema consider due cause diabetic macular edema . 2 . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , visual acuity would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigmentary change , dense subfoveal hard exudate , nonretinal condition , etc. ) . 3 . An ocular condition present ( diabetic retinopathy ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , IrvineGass Syndrome , etc. ) . 4 . Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity three line ( i.e. , cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) . 5 . History focal/grid macular photocoagulation within 12 week ( three month ) prior study entry . 6 . History panretinal scatter photocoagulation ( PRP ) within four month prior study entry . 7 . Anticipated need PRP four month follow study entry . 8 . History prior par plana vitrectomy . 9 .
