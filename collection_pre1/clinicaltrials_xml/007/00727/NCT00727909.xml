	<detailed_description>Hearing loss common service-connected disability nationwide Veteran 's Health Administration ( VHA ) system , hear aid provide primary treatment option . Although benefit hearing-aid use clearly establish , ~16-30 % adult hear aid use . Several factor believe result non-use traditional hearing aid , include ( 1 ) poor fit comfort , ( 2 ) poor cosmetic , ( 3 ) whistle feedback , ( 4 ) occlusion , ( 5 ) difficulty understand speech noise . Recently , open canal ( OC ) hearing-aid style become viable approach address address many problem result non-use traditional hearing aid , particularly individual mild moderately-severe hearing loss . Although OC hear aid many potential advantage , also potential limitation . For example , maximum low high-frequency gain available OC fitting less available traditional custom ( TC ) hearing-aid fitting , could result less optimal amplification individual . In addition , directional microphone benefit speech understanding noise , available TC fitting , likely limited OC fitting due loss low-frequency gain ( Ricketts et al. , 2005 ) . Since OC TC fitting appropriate listener mild moderately-severe hearing loss , evidence need determine style hearing aid preferred majority . Currently , OC fitting use small behind-the-ear ( BTE ) hearing aid couple thin tube plastic cover wire end vent `` open '' ear tip . When TC fitting use patient similar hearing loss , majority either in-the-ear ( ITE ) in-the-canal ( ITC ) .In propose study comparison make OC vs. TC fitting . In addition primary comparison , preference one two OC hearing aid , viz. , OC instrument receiver ear ( OCRITE ) OC instrument receiver hearing-aid case ( OCRIHA ) , determine . The outcome OCRITE , OCRIHA , TC hearing-aid use related factor : ( 1 ) comfort cosmetic , ( 2 ) subjective occlusion , ( 3 ) objective occlusion , ( 4 ) sound quality external sound , ( 5 ) feedback , ( 6 ) ease use , ( 7 ) audibility , ( 8 ) aid signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) benefit , ( 9 ) localization , measure large ( n = 288 ) , randomized-controlled , three-site ( Bay Pines , Mountain Home , Nashville ) clinical trial , utilize three-period ( two month ) , cross-over design . A total 13 variable measure 9 hearing-aid fitting style-related factor . At end study , participant rank order preference three hear aid fitting determine ( 1 ) prefer OC fitting ( OCRITE vs. OCRIHA ) ( 2 ) whether high rank OC fit TC fitting preferred . Preferred OC vs. TC difference score calculate relevant variable . The ability differences score predict preference participant OC vs. TC hear aid determine , order develop evidence-based hearing aid selection model .</detailed_description>
