	<brief_summary>This study try determine whether oral administration specific probiotic ( good bacteria ) premature infant hospitalize neonatal intensive care unit may prevent infection development severe inflammatory disease bowel call necrotizing enterocolitis . The investigator propose premature infant give probiotic colonize gut bad bacteria develop infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neonatal infection currently cause 1.6 million death annually develop country . Preterm infant especially vulnerable infection immature immune response exposure hospital milieu promote gastrointestinal colonization Gram-negative pathogen . Multiple study show colonization bowel probiotic ( nonpathogenic anaerobic bacteria ) competitively inhibit attachment Gram-negative pathogen decrease likelihood bacterial translocation development life threaten infections.This potentially high-impact , low-cost intervention may significantly improve survival morbidity preterm infant around world . RESEARCH OBJECTIVE We seek determine whether prophylactic administration Lactobacillus reuteri decrease incidence death nosocomial sepsis among susceptible preterm infant neonatal care set Colombia . Specific aim : 1 . To investigate efficacy safety oral Lactobacillus reuteri primary endpoint prevention death nosocomial sepsis preterm infant well powered multicenter , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial ( RCT ) . 2 . To assess impact Lactobacillus reuteri four secondary endpoint : necrotizing enterocolitis , prevalence Gram-negative pathogen , duration hospitalization , frequency outpatient treatment re-admission infectious cause 6 month post-discharge . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Study Design : Overview Multi-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial Primary outcome : Death nosocomial sepsis Secondary outcome : NEC , prevalence Gram-negative pathogen , duration hospitalization , frequency outpatient treatment re-admission infectious cause 6 month post-discharge . Post-hoc analysis evaluate difference RCT outcomes two key subgroup : breast-fed formula-fed infant vaginal delivery versus cesarean section , probiotic expose unexposed infant . In addition , look death nosocomial sepsis separate outcome ensure differential effect treatment either outcome . Location : 11 NICUs Colombia . Randomization Stratification : Stratification accord participate institution do order control center-related difference . Stratification birth weight perform 2 group : &lt; 1500 gram 1501 2000 gram . When eligibility criterion meet , infant randomly assign treatment probiotic placebo use computerize stratified balanced block randomization design . Assignment treatment accomplish use seal , sequentially number , opaque envelope , color-coded stratum , available NICU pharmacy . Experimental Design : Study patient randomize birth either placebo probiotic administration ( treatment group ) . The hospital pharmacy charge random allocation . Vials probiotic placebo identify pharmacist accord randomization send NICU administration patient . For randomized treatment arm , L reuteri DSM 17938 administer dose 10 eighth colony-forming unit 5 drop commercially available oil suspension per day discharge hospital . This oil suspension stable 21 month 2o C 8o C ( document manufacturer , BioGaia AB , Stockholm , Sweden ) . For randomized placebo arm , patient receive equal number drop identical vial containing oil base , without probiotic . The preparation administer even patient begin feed protocol contraindication feed . Patients stratify accord exposure breast milk premature infant formula alone combination . Infants mother insufficient production breast milk offer premature formula . Feeding nutrition protocol standardize among participate institution minimize confound effect diverse practice . A standard feeding protocol may start 24-48 hour life volume 10 ml/kg/day patient hemodynamically stable , define stable blood pressure . The two milliliter breast milk premature infant formula subtract total daily volume . Feedings advance slowly volume 10 20 ml/kg/day depend tolerance.84 Umbilical line may remove feed increase 20 ml/kg/day . Parenteral nutrition start second day life accord standardize protocol . MCT oil ( 2 kcal/30ml ) use dietary supplement increase energy content breast milk formula need . Human milk fortifiers may start full enteral feed tolerate . Feedings discontinue abdominal radiograph take sign feed intolerance ( recurrent emesis , gastric aspirate &gt; 50 % previous feed abdominal distension presence macroscopic blood stool ) . In situation feed temporarily discontinue , patient may re-enter study initiation feed . Patients develop NEC may continue study able resume feed treatment . Inotropic support , wean , contraindication begin continue protocol . Administration probiotic end discharge , infant 's status continue monitor 6 month post-discharge . Patient 's participation study end 6 month post-discharge , upon death patient .</detailed_description>
