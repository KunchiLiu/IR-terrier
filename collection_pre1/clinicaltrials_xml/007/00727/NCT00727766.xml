	<brief_title>Oral Clofarabine Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient 60 old dismal traditional therapy . Several factor contribute poor prognosis old individual , include increase incidence multidrug resistance efflux pump , comorbidities unfavorable cytogenetics . The recently report AML-13 ALFA trial suggest less intense consolidation population least equivalent intense , induction style effort . Clofarabine next generation nucleoside analogue design optimize favorable attribute fludarabine cladribine , minimize toxicity . The intravenous formulation show considerable activity old patient AML consider either unfit unlikely benefit conventional therapy . Additionally , clofarabine oral formulation patient may find acceptable consolidation therapy rather multiple course intravenous medication , administer several day . This study design traditional 3x3 phase I trial intention define maximum tolerate dose oral clofarabine consolidation old patient AML remission .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis Acute Myeloid Leukemia accord WHO criteria Age ≥ 60 year enrollment Patients must complete remission bone marrow examination , within 30 day enrollment , follow treatment cytotoxic induction chemotherapy regimen ( 7+3 ) Complete remission must confirm bone marrow biopsy If one cycle consolidation administer , patient may within 60 day confirmation complete remission bone marrow biopsy Minimum platelet count 100,000 Patients may receive `` lowintensity '' therapy ( i.e . decitabine , lenalidomide , etc ) prior traditional induction chemotherapy . Patients may receive 1 cycle cytarabinebased consolidation therapy . Patients must ECOG performance status 02 begin consolidation therapy . Have adequate renal hepatic function indicate follow laboratory value : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.0 mg/dL ; serum creatinine &gt; 1.0 mg/dL , estimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) must &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculate Modification Diet Renal Disease equation Predicted GFR ( ml/min/1.73 m2 ) = 186 x ( Serum Creatinine ) 1.154 x ( age year ) 0.023 x ( 0.742 patient female ) x ( 1.212 patient black ) Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL × upper limit normal ( ULN ) except unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia secondary Gilbert 's syndrome Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) /alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 × ULN Capable understand investigational nature , potential risk benefit study , able provide sign valid write informed consent appropriate , appoint legally authorize representative capable understanding investigational nature , potential risk benefit study , able provide sign valid write informed consent benefit patient . Male female patient child bear potential must use effective contraceptive method study minimum 6 month study treatment . Patients MAY receive prior therapy purine analog ( fludarabine cladribine ) . Current concomitant chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy specify protocol . The diagnosis AMLM3 ( acute promyelocytic leukemia ) characterize translocation involve retinoic acid receptoralpha ( RARalpha ) gene . Use investigational agent within 2 week anticancer therapy within 2 week study entry . The patient must recover acute toxicity previous therapy . Have severe concurrent disease , history serious organ dysfunction disease involve heart , kidney , liver , organ system may place patient undue risk undergo treatment . Patients systemic fungal , bacterial , viral , infection control ( define exhibit ongoing signs/symptoms related infection without improvement , despite appropriate antibiotic treatment ) . Have currently active gastrointestinal disease , prior surgery may affect ability patient absorb oral clofarabine .</criteria>
