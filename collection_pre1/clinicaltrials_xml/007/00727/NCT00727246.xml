	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether investigational drug , call `` CDP-Choline '' , improve memory people traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . To , ask people traumatic brain injury people without traumatic brain injury part study . We compare result group see investigational drug make difference memory . We also compare brain imaging result information collect take study medication see difference . We hypothesize difference brain activation pattern individual TBI healthy control , well difference performance memory test baseline . We hypothesize , treatment CDP-Choline , pattern neuroimaging finding cognitive test result individual TBI closely resemble result observe healthy individual . We hope learn study helpful future treatment individual head injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CDP-Choline Working Memory After TBI : A Neuroimaging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite prevalence work memory deficit follow traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , scientific data regard pharmacological treatment problem limit . As deficit work memory know significant impact functional outcome individual TBI , research area essential order physician able treat problem effectively . The primary goal propose project examine efficacy particular pharmacological agent , CDP-Choline , treatment work memory deficit follow traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . The study sample consist 48 subject : A group 24 individual sustain moderate severe TBI , group 24 healthy control . Each group divide placebo treatment group . The project utilize functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) investigate cerebral neurophysiological effect treatment CDP-Choline . A work memory task ( N-Back ) employ fMRI session . In addition , effect treatment CDP-Choline neuropsychological testing performance also evaluate , correlation behavioral performance neuroimaging result observe . We achieve goal compare baseline neuropsychological testing result well fMRI result , second set test neuroimaging result obtain follow 1 month pharmacological treatment CDP Choline placebo . Based preliminary study available literature , expect see follow : Baseline fMRI result expect show individual TBI display alter pattern cerebral activation work memory task , compare healthy control . With CDP-Choline treatment , expect TBI subject display fMRI laterality dispersion pattern closely resemble pattern healthy control . In addition , anticipate improvement behavioral performance specific work memory task ( N-Back ) , traditional neuropsychological test associate CDP-Choline treatment , great magnitude change test result TBI group compare change note control placebo group . Finally , anticipate specific significant correlation observe neuropsychological testing result neuroimaging finding , strength relationship great TBI treatment group , compare placebo healthy control group . By conduct propose study manner , hope provide scientific data allow improve treatment , ultimately improve functional outcome individual sustain TBI .</detailed_description>
