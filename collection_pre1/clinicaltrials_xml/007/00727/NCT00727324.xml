	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis characterize abnormal activation , damage , colon epithelium , consider central pathogenic mechanism . Activation colon epithelium cell UC associate abnormal high expression Toll-like receptor , include TLR-4 , major transducer LPS , bind specifically lipid A portion LPS . Alkaline Phosphatase bind subsequently dephosphorylates LPS , thereby eliminate ability LPS activate TLR-4 . This expect 1 ) prevent activation intestinal epithelium 2 ) prevent systemic inflammatory response result transmigration endotoxin though leaky inflame intestinal mucosa . Therefore , expect administration BIAP may attenuate prevent local systemic inflammatory response patient severe ulcerative colitis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) general term group non-specific , chronic inflammatory disorder digestive tract , unknown etiology . IBD may divide two major category : Ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease , characterize tendency towards frequent acute relapse lead devastate chronic destruction intestinal mucosal barrier function . Whereas Crohn 's disease affect whole digestive tract , ulcerative colitis characterize colonic involvement . Surgical intervention frequently require Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . Therapeutic intervention date predominantly base reduction induce local mucosal- systemic inflammation use 5-ASA , corticosteroid , cyclosporine , TNFα antibody . In IBD , delicate balance pro-inflammatory molecule , anti-inflammatory molecule immunoregulatory cell , tightly regulate immune system , disrupt result chronic , relapse inflammation . Tissue plasma concentration pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma , IL-1ß , IL-6 , IL-8 TNFα elevate inflammatory bowel disease correlate IBD activity . In patient inflammatory bowel disease circulate LPS detect also increase AP level observe . The presence endotoxin probably consequence damage intestinal mucosa lead increase LPS influx gut translocation cause aggravate systemic inflammatory response . The increase AP level observe patient may cause suboptimal detoxification gut-derived influx LPS response thereof non-intestinal organ . Thus propose liver shed alkaline phosphatase ( fast act liver alkaline phosphatase ) massively insult LPS . Systemic consequence IBD may induce and/or aggravate significantly influx LPS . The propose normal natural defense mechanism LPS include , amongst others , cleavage one phosphate group LPS endogenous AP . It therefore conceivable reduction amount active LPS intestinal lumen exogenously administer AP result correspond relative decrease LPS-influx circulation subject , consequence , inhibit LPS medicate systemic inflammatory response . Moreover , dephosphorylated LPS reduce ability LPS activate TLR-4 , result decreased nuclear factor κB activation decrease local inflammatory response . In order investigate clinical potential exogenously administer BIAP human use , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics previously study animal toxicology study subsequent Phase I IIa clinical trial , respectively . These study do intravenously administer BIAP . Following study successful completion animal pharmacology study human volunteer study oral AP next phase development exogenously administer oral AP test compound limit population patient IBD .</detailed_description>
