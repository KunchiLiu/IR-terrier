	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Lenalidomide give combination FC . ( Phase I ) - To evaluate complete remission ( CR ) rate FC give combination MTD Lenalidomide ( FCL ) . ( Phase II ) Secondary - To define toxicity infection rate patient treat FCL median number deliver course FCL , overall response rate progression-free survival relationship response baseline biologic factor ( IgVH , FISH , ZAP-70 , CD38 ) . - To evaluate overall response rate ( complete partial response ) . - To evaluate progression-free survival . OUTLINE : This phase I - II multicenter , non-comparative , open label study patient previously treat CLL aim define MTD Lenalidomide give combination Fludarabine , Cyclophosphamide evaluate ( CR ) rate FC give combination MTD Lenalidomide ( FCL ) . All patient receive six monthly course FCL schedule consist three day Fludarabine Cyclophosphamide administration ( d1-d3 ) combine 14 day Lenalidomide administration ( d1-d14 ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 18 month .</detailed_description>
