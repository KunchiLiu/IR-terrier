	<brief_summary>Many IBD patient take immunosuppressive agent uncertain capacity mount truly protective response vaccination . If IBD patient adequate immunological response , may need increase dosage get booster shot . Many clinician treat patient autoimmune disease ask vaccine safe effective . Thus , study important clinical public health significance one million people United States diagnose IBD . There much study HPV immunocompromised patient . Research healthy woman immunize set three HPV vaccine demonstrate significantly increase antibody titer . In addition , significantly reduce HPV incident persistent infection HPV-related disease ( cervical , vulvar , vaginal cancer , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , genital wart ) five year follow-up compare control receive placebo . The HPV vaccine well tolerate without significant side effect . The aim research measure immune response 9-26 year old IBD patient immunosuppressive agent receive HPV vaccine compare historical control . We also evaluate number type vaccine-associated adverse event well disease activity flare-ups occur dose vaccine . We hypothesize IBD patient immunosuppressive therapy similar immune response HPV type 6 , 11 , 16 18 one month postdose 3 compare healthy age-matched historical control . The patient population include IBD patient immunosuppressive medication . Recruiting approximately 100 patient provide adequate power study . A blood sample take IBD patient evaluate baseline antibody level marker ( e.g. , ESR , CBC , albumin ) immediately immunization HPV vaccine . Lab test redrawn 7 month evaluate level antibody titer follow marker . During study , track basic laboratory measure , disease status use Pediatric Crohn 's Disease Active Index Harvey-Bradshaw Index UC , side effect vaccination , adverse event .</brief_summary>
