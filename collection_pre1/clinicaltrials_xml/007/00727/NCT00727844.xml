	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Masan Seoul , South Korea , investigate effectiveness linezolid ( LZD ) treat patient extensively drug resistant tuberculosis ( XDR TB ) . Because regular medicine work well XDR TB , many people die regular TB , successfully treat take TB medication 6 month . Linezolid use treat kind infection , well study TB . This study examine side effect effectiveness prolong treatment linezolid two different dos . People 20 year age old XDR TB eligible 3-year study . Participants underwent follow test procedure : - LZD treatment : Patients randomly assign one two study group . Group 1 patient observe 2 month start LZD , group 2 patient begin take LZD right away . Both group begin 600 mg daily dose LZD . After patient stop cough TB germ ( 4 month LZD ) randomly assign either continue take 600 mg LZD rest study take decrease dose 300 mg . In addition LZD , patient continue take currently prescribe TB medication . - Medical history . - Physical examination month treatment . - Sputum collection week 3 week patient longer contagious . - Blood draw every week 16 24 week month . - Urine collection several time point . - Nerve eye examination start treatment monthly look possible LZD side effect . - CT scan lung three four time first year later study . For test patient lay table within doughnut-shaped CT scanner special X-ray picture take . Patients participate substudy PET scan instead CT scan . For test , patient give injection vein radioactive chemical detect special camera view screen . The patient lay table within doughnut-shaped scanner picture take .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Linezolid Treat Extensively-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>World-wide , increase incidence multi-drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) extensively drug-resistant TB ( XDR-TB ) . For patient diagnose either deadly disease , effective drug treatment option sub-optimal non-existent . In South Korea , grow number patient respond therapy little hope survival without new drug . Linezolid ( LZD ) , antimicrobial approve gram positive bacterial infection , use off-label drug resistant TB quickly become seek drug population , despite lack clinical evidence efficacy . At present time prohibitive cost LZD limit widespread use ; however , patent exclusivity expire May 2015 imperative examine benefit versus risk LZD TB control set . The National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital ( NMTH ) Masan , South Korea National Medical Center Seoul , South Korea provide u opportunity systematically address question LZD highly drug-resistant population . This Phase 2a , randomize , 2-arm study LZD , evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability LZD subject whose isolates show resistance know active TB drug fail respond active drug susceptible . Subjects require fail regimen least 6 month prior study entry , persistent sputum smear positivity , culture positivity significant clinical sign response therapy . To consider study , subject 's treatment plan must stable without addition drug subject isolate suspect sensitive : however drug may discontinue time . Subjects stratify base upon diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type I II include ) use block randomization . At primary randomization , subject randomly assign either immediately add 600 mg LZD daily exist regimen delay 2 month add 600 mg LZD daily exist regimen . A second randomization occur 2 consecutive negative sputum smear 4 month start LZD therapy ( whichever come first ) , subject either stay current 600 mg LZD daily de-escalate 300 mg LZD daily ( see Section 4.1.4 Study Schema ) . The second randomization stratify diabetes . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy LZD therapy , measure sputum culture conversion . Secondary aim study include : investigation pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile LZD blood ; tolerability toxicity prolong LZD administration dose 300 mg 600 mg daily ; rate change radiological finding compute tomography ( CT ) ; rate relapse 12 month discontinuation therapy ; rate development drug resistance LZD ; change immunologic bacterial lipid marker LZD therapy ; correlation whole-blood kill assay response LZD therapy ; effect LZD mitochondrial function , potential early indicator LZD toxicity . In substudy , aim investigate change lung architecture cellular activity treatment use F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose - positron emission tomography-computed tomography ( FDG-PET-CT ) 20 subject LZD therapy . Estimated total study duration subject approximately 3 year .</detailed_description>
