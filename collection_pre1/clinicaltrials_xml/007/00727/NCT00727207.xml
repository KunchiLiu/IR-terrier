	<brief_title>Everolimus Treating Older Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma Previously Treated With First-Line Second-Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine progression-free survival old patient mantle cell lymphoma receive everolimus previously treat first- second-line chemotherapy . Secondary - Determine toxicity feasibility treatment drug . - Determine efficacy drug patient . - Compare duration remission first- vs second-line chemotherapy . - Determine rate objective remission . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral everolimus daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
