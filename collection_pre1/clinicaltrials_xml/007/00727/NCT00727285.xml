	<brief_summary>Presently , effectiveness treatment CF lung disease judge improvement lung function ( FEV1 ) . However , CF patient , FEV1 range severely decrease normal , improvement may occur slowly . Thus , clinical trial require many patient prolong period evaluate medication . As pace drug development accelerate , longer possible test promising candidate therapy use conventional study design . A sensitive technique assess lung inflammation develop us expression gene locate circulate blood cell . Mononuclear cell pass repeatedly blood vessel lung , expose many inflammatory product present airway . Over past 4 year investigator identify small group candidate gene unregulated downregulated response antibiotic treatment . The investigator propose prospectively test method quantify lung inflammation large group CF patient undergo treatment pulmonary exacerbation . Blood sample antibiotic treatment pulmonary exacerbation , relative change gene expression compare improvement FEV1 clinical response , determine utility method use study . If successful , technique could allow rapid noninvasive method gauge immediate effect new treatment , assist caregiver determine optimal treatment strategy individual .</brief_summary>
