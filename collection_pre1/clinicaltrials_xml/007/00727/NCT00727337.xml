	<brief_title>Supplementing Hearing Aids With Computerized Auditory Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This propose study multi-site , single-masked ( blind ) , randomize control , parallel group clinical trial ass effectiveness home PC-based auditory training supplement standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention veteran treat hearing loss , without previous hearing-aid experience . The participant assign randomly one three group , hearing-aid use stratify within group : ( 1 ) Group 1 , HA+AT , participant receive standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention ( HA ) complete four-week LACE auditory training program ( AT ) ; ( 2 ) Group 2 , HA , participant receive standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention ( HA ) ; ( 3 ) Group 3 , HA+DL , participant receive standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention ( HA ) complete four-weeks placebo auditory training , consist direct listening ( DL ) books-on-tape . The participant group attend four test session . During Session 1 inform consent process complete , baseline assessment make ensure participant meet study inclusion criterion ( page 52 ) , test predictor variable ( page 57-58 ) complete , hear aid assess correct functionality ( page 53 ) . The participant assign randomly study group . Session 2 occur four week Session 1 . During Session 2 , baseline performance outcome measure assess ( page 54-57 ) , performance predictor variable . Following testing , participant Groups 1 3 receive training use AT DL program . Session 3 occur end 4-week experimental training period . During Session 3 participant retested outcome measure ass short-term intervention outcome . During Session 4 , occur seven-months post-study enrollment ( i.e. , six-months post training completion Groups 1 3 ) , participant retested outcome measure examine long-term outcome . In Sessions 2-4 , stability hearing-aid function assess electroacoustic measure .</detailed_description>
