	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make gene-modified tumor cell may help body build effective immune response kill pancreatic cancer cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving vaccine therapy together cyclophosphamide may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether vaccine therapy effective without cyclophosphamide treat patient pancreatic cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study side effect vaccine therapy see well work give without cyclophosphamide treat patient undergo chemotherapy radiation therapy stage I stage II pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy Stage I Stage II Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety feasibility GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccine ( GM-CSF gene-transfected allogeneic pancreatic cancer vaccine ) administer alone combination single intravenous dose daily metronomic oral dos cyclophosphamide neoadjuvant adjuvant treatment patient resectable stage I II adenocarcinoma head , neck , uncinate process pancreas . - To assess immune cell infiltrates , particularly T-regulatory cell ( Tregs ) CD4+ CD8+ effector T cell , neoadjuvant GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccination . - To assess change number function peripheral mesothelin-specific CD8+ T cell CD4+ , FoxP3+ , GITR+ Tregs GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccination administer alone combination single dose metronomic dos cyclophosphamide . Secondary - To estimate disease-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - To estimate effect immune parameter disease-free overall survival patient . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm A : Patients receive GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccine intradermally ( ID ) day 1 undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy day 15 . Approximately 6-10 week surgery , patient receive additional dose vaccine . Beginning approximately 1 month vaccination , patient receive standard adjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprise gemcitabine , fluorouracil capecitabine , radiotherapy 26-28 week . Beginning approximately 4-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive vaccine day 1 . Treatment vaccine repeat every 28 day 4 course . - Arm B : Patients receive low-dose cyclophosphamide IV day 0 GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccine ID day 1 . Patients undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy day 15 . Approximately 6-10 week surgery , patient receive low-dose cyclophosphamide IV day 0 vaccine day 1 . Beginning approximately 1 month vaccination , patient receive standard adjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprise gemcitabine , fluorouracil capecitabine , radiotherapy 26-28 week . Beginning approximately 4-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive low-dose cyclophosphamide IV day 0 vaccine day 1 . Treatment cyclophosphamide vaccine repeat every 28 day 4 course . - Arm C : Patients receive GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccine ID day 1 low-dose oral cyclophosphamide twice daily day 1-7 . Patients undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy day 15 . Approximately 6-10 week surgery , patient receive vaccine day 1 low-dose oral cyclophosphamide twice daily day 1-7 15-21 . Beginning approximately 1 month vaccination , patient receive standard adjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprise gemcitabine , fluorouracil capecitabine , radiotherapy 26-28 week . Beginning approximately 4-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive vaccine day 1 low-dose oral cyclophosphamide twice daily day 1-7 15-21 . Treatment vaccine cyclophosphamide repeat every 28 day 4 course . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically correlative laboratory study , include immune cell analysis . Immune cell analysis include monitoring quantitative change peripheral blood lymphocyte , include regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) , functional analysis T-cell immune response . Tumor tissue sample collect time surgery analyze tumor antigen infiltrate immune cell immunohistochemistry quantitative real-time PCR . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
