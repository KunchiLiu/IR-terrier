	<brief_summary>Background : Patients neurofibromatosis type 1 increase risk develop tumor call plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) arise nerve . These tumor usually non-cancerous , cause serious medical problem . Sorafenib recently approve treat patient kidney cancer test child cancer . It affect several pathway think important development growth PN may therefore shrink tumor slow growth . Objectives : To determine high dose sorafenib safely give child young adult PN . To identify side effect sorafenib patient . To study body handle sorafenib measure amount drug bloodstream time To determine drug affect blood flow blood cell proteins . To determine sorafenib shrink slow growth PN . To determine effect sorafenib learning , attention , memory , quality life . Eligibility : Patients 3 18 year age NF1 inoperable PN cause significant disability . Design : Patients take sorafenib tablet twice day 28-day treatment cycle . They may continue treatment tumor grow develop unacceptable drug side effect . In dose escalation study , dosage increase every 3 6 child enrol high safe dose determine . In case , dose exceed used child cancer . Patients monitor regularly physical examination , blood urine test , MRI scan quality-of-life questionnaire . Patients whose bone still grow periodic x-rays hip low leg monitor possible change structure grow bone . Patients periodic test learn memory start treatment cycle 4 , 12 , 18 24 . Patients pharmacokinetic study examine body handle sorafenib . blood sample draw first dose sorafenib 30 minute , 1 hour , 2 hour , 3 hour , 5 hour , 8 hour , 10 12 hour , 24 hour 30 36 hour follow first dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treat Children Young Adults With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Inoperable Plexiform Neurofibromas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Patients Neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1 ) increase risk develop tumor central peripheral nervous system , include plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) , benign nerve sheath tumor among debilitate complication NF1 . Plexiform neurofibroma may congenital appear fast growth rate young child . There standard treatment option PN surgery , often difficult due extensive growth invasion surround tissue . - Plexiform neurofibroma compose neoplastic Schwann cell lack NF1 gene expression result upregulation Ras , initiate several signal cascade regulate cell proliferation . In addition , PN express epidermal platelet derive growth factor receptor vascular endothelial growth factor , may promote angiogenesis . - Sorafenib , novel orally bioavailable , bi-aryl urea , potent inhibitor raf kinase number receptor tyrosine kinase , currently undergo evaluation adult cancer , may mediate anti-tumor effect PN several mechanism . Objectives : - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral sorafenib administer daily pediatric patient NF1 inoperable PN . - To define acute chronic toxicity , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics sorafenib . - To evaluate potential bone toxicity sorafenib growth plate expansion growth retardation use automate volumetric MRI analysis growth plate , multiple measure height growth , dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry evaluate bone mineral density , laboratory measurement evaluation bone turnover metabolism . - To determine effect sorafenib growth rate PN , quality life , cognitive function treatment sorafenib . Eligibility : - Pediatric Patients ( 3-18 year ) NF1 inoperable measurable PN potential cause significant morbidity . Design : - Sorafenib administer orally BID continuous dose schedule ( 28 day = 1 treatment cycle ) . Limited dose escalation perform define MTD base tolerability sorafenib first three treatment cycle . - Disease status evaluate use volumetric MRI analysis regular interval . - The plasma pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics sorafenib evaluate . - Cognitive function quality life outcome also assess pilot fashion define measure use subsequent phase II trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age : great equal 3 year less equal 18 year age time study enrollment . The upper age limit place early childhood puberty consider great risk disease progression , sorafenib may benefit . In addition , important objective study characterize pharmacokinetics sorafenib pediatric population since well study adult . 2 . Diagnosis : Patients NF1 inoperable PNs potential cause significant morbidity , ( limit ) head neck lesion could compromise airway great vessel , brachial lumbar plexus lesion could cause nerve compression loss function , lesion could result major deformity ( e.g. , orbital lesion ) significant cosmetic problem , lesion extremity cause limb hypertrophy loss function , painful lesion . Histologic confirmation tumor necessary presence consistent clinical radiographic finding , consider malignant degeneration PN clinically suspect . A PN define neurofibroma grow along length nerve may involve multiple fascicle branch . A spinal PN involve two level connection level extend laterally along nerve . In addition PN , study subject must either positive genetic test NF1 least one diagnostic criterion NF1 list ( NIH Consensus conference : Six cafeaulait spot ( great equal 0.5cm prepubertal subject great equal 1.5 cm post pubertal subject ) Freckling axilla groin Optic glioma Two Lisch nodule A distinctive bony lesion ( dysplasia sphenoid bone dysplasia thin long bone cortex ) A firstdegree relative NF1 3 . Measurable disease : Patients must least one measurable PN , define lesion least 3 cm measure one dimension . Patients underwent surgery resection PN eligible provide PN incompletely resect measurable per criterion . 4 . Prior Therapy : Patients NF1 eligible complete tumor resection feasible , patient surgical option refuse surgery . Since standard effective chemotherapy patient NF1 PN , patient may treat trial without receive prior medical therapy direct PN .
