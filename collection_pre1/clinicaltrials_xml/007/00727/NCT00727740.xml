	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine indomethacin , anti-inflammatory medication class medication know NSAIDs ( non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) reduce risk pancreatitis Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography ( ERCP . ) The hypothesis indomethacin decrease incidence severity post-ERCP pancreatitis . Patients schedule undergo ERCP enrol . Following ERCP , patient randomize receive dose indomethacin placebo ( inactive substance ) instill duodenum via biopsy channel duodenoscope . All patient observe 4 hour follow ERCP part routine clinical practice . Patients minimal pain discharged 4 hour observation period . All patient baseline serum amylase level repeat 2 4 hour ERCP complete . Patients significant abdominal pain hospitalize evaluated pancreatitis . Patients discharge home contact telephone follow day ask complication ERCP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Double-blind Study Determine Intraduodenal Indomethacin Can Decrease Incidence Post-ERCP Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-ERCP pancreatitis likely due patient 's inflammatory response duct instrumentation procedure severity base magnitude response . Phospholipase A2 ( PLA2 ) play pivotal role inflammation since regulates many pro-inflammatory mediator , include prostaglandin , leukotrienes , platelet activate factor . NSAIDs inhibit PLA2 , indomethacin potent clinically available PLA2 inhibitor . Our study hypothesis treatment indomethacin reduce inflammatory response ERCP , therefore lessen incidence severity post-ERCP pancreatitis . Aim : We plan conduct prospective , multicenter , randomize , placebo-controlled trial determine single dose 100 mg indomethacin suspension instill duodenum endoscope immediately follow ERCP reduce incidence severity post-ERCP pancreatitis . Patients schedule undergo diagnostic therapeutic ERCP would serially enrol . Standard indication ERCP include follow : evaluation obstructive jaundice , unexplained pancreatitis , recurrent pancreaticobiliary pain abnormal liver test . Those patient deem increased risk pancreatitis ( suspected sphincter oddi dysfunction , age &lt; 40 yr , normal bilirubin , prior post ERCP pancreatitis , difficult cannulation , pancreatic duct injection , pancreatic duct sphincterotomy , undergo pre-cut sphincterotomy balloon dilation biliary sphincter ) would undergo placement 3 French pancreatic stent time ERCP . Prospective randomize study demonstrate marked decrease post-ERCP pancreatitis rate high risk patient undergone pancreatic stenting . Following ERCP therapy ( require ) , would randomize receive dose indomethacin placebo instill duodenum via biopsy channel duodenoscope . Patients well physicians nurse perform procedure oversee study unaware treatment assignment . All endoscopic clinical practice follow current standard care Yale interventional endoscopy department . Participation study alter way . The experimental intervention limit administration single dose indomethacin , inject endoscope channel prior removal scope conclusion ERCP subsequent monitoring sign symptoms post-ERCP pancreatitis , much also part routine clinical practice . At end procedure detail endoscopic maneuver record , include ease/difficulty cannulation , sphincterotomy ( biliary and/or pancreatic ) perform , number cannulation , number pancreatic duct injection , technique sphincterotomy ( Needle Knife/Stent v pull-type ) duct diameter . All patient observe 4 hour follow ERCP part routine clinical practice follow ERCP . Patients minimal pain discharged 4-hour period observation . All patient baseline serum amylase level repeat 4 hour ERCP complete . Patients significant abdominal pain follow ERCP hospitalize overnight evaluate post-ERCP pancreatitis monitoring vital sign , urinary output serum amylase level follow morning . Patients ongoing symptom 48 hour later undergo image either abdominal ultrasonography CT scanning . This also represent current standard clinical practice . Patients discharge home contact telephone follow day assess complication include post-ERCP pancreatitis .</detailed_description>
