	<brief_summary>Prevention treatment strategy diabetes use exercise cornerstone . Even though endurance training strength training improve insulin resistance , strength training may well suit person risk type 2 diabetes .

	<detailed_description>Life style alteration powerful deterrent develop type 2 diabetes cornerstone treatment condition . Both aerobic resistance exercise improve diabetes blood glucose control insulin resistance . These two type exercise appear exert effect different muscle fiber type - red endurance white strength . Similar effect endurance exercise training , strength training increase muscle glucose transporter isoform 4 ( GLUT4 ) , contrast , mitochondrion number increase . We hypothesize ( 1 ) strength train person pre-diabetes may effective reverse insulin resistance novel mechanism distinct endurance training-induced mitochondrial biogenesis . We hypothesize ( 2 ) resistance exercise training enhances whole body insulin action primarily increase white fiber size via protein kinase mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) improve insulin-stimulated glucose uptake increase GLUT4 expression primarily white fiber train muscle . In proposal , perform eight week progressive strength training ten subject Metabolic Syndrome high risk develop type 2 diabetes ten sedentary control subject . This project build experience study focus resistance training whose result present application . In pilot study , subject exercise stationary bicycle six week cause muscle GLUT4 phopho-mTOR increase substantially , maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) , phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator ( PGC-1α ) , mitochondrial marker change . Our hypothesis test two Specific Aims . ( 1 ) Subjects high risk diabetes undergo progressively increase intensity resistance exercise training increase strength improved insulin responsiveness quantify demonstrate significant benefit , ( 2 ) quantify effect resistance exercise training anatomic functional adaptation muscle . We characterize fiber type , fiber size , fiber-specific change mitochondrial DNA enzyme , fiber-specific change principle glucose transporter muscle ( GLUT4 , GLUT5 , GLUT12 ) , evaluate change two distinct intramuscular pathway ( AMPK , mTOR ) regulatory factor ( PGC-1α , PPARγ , PPARδ ) use immunoblots muscle subcellular fraction immunohistochemical technique . These evaluation molecular mechanism also include assess change full human Affymetrix gene array data may move u new potential resistance training-regulated gene target . It long-term goal team investigator understand interplay life style change pharmacological agent prevention treatment diabetes . Our result facilitate development effective clinical option turn back epidemic obesity diabetes United States .</detailed_description>
