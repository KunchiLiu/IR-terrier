	<brief_summary>The goal Phase I part clinical research study find high safe dose bendamustine give patient acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , Chronic myelogenous ( myeloid ) leukemia ( CML ) blastic phase , Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia ( CMML ) , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . The goal Phase II part clinical research study learn bendamustine help control AML , ALL MDS . The safety drug continue study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine Acute Leukemia MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Bendamustine design damage destroy DNA cancer cell . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 60 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 3 group 31 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose bendamustine receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level bendamustine . Each new group receive high dose bendamustine group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose bendamustine find . If enrol Phase II portion , receive bendamustine high dose tolerate Phase I portion . Study Drug Administration : You receive bendamustine needle catheter vein 2 hour twice Days 1-4 every 4 week study cycle . You begin new study cycle blood cell count return appropriate level . You may begin new study cycle earlier disease get bad improve . Study Visits : Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test every 3-7 day Cycle 1 , every 1-2 week cycle . A bone marrow aspirate perform check status disease Cycle 1 every 3-4 Cycles thereafter , need document response . Length Study : You may remain study long benefitting . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Bendamustine FDA approve commercially available United States . At time , bendamustine use research . Up 153 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients 16 year age old . 2 . Patients must relapsed/refractory leukemias standard therapy anticipate result durable remission ( long 3 month ) . Patients poorrisk myelodysplasia ( MDS ) [ i.e . refractory anemia excess blast ( RAEB1 RAEB2 ) World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification ] chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) also candidate protocol . Relapsed/refractory leukemias include acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) blastic phase . 3 . Continued # 2 : Elderly patient AML eligible frontline standard therapy , refuse treat intensive chemotherapy , may eligible . The phase II portion study enroll patient AML , MDS , ALL . Patients CML CMML participate phase II portion study . Patients consider stem cell transplant also eligible protocol . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 03 . 5 . Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , woman naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month surgically sterile ) must use acceptable contraceptive method ( abstinence , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , oral contraceptive double barrier device ) , must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 2 week prior begin treatment trial . Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive method duration time study . Men woman must maintain effective contraception 4 week last dose drug administer . 6 . Must able willing give write informed consent . 7 . In absence rapidly progress disease , interval prior treatment time study drug administration least 2 week cytotoxic agent , least 5 halflives noncytotoxic agent . If patient hydroxyurea control peripheral blood leukemic cell count , patient must hydroxyurea least 24 hour initiation treatment protocol . Persistent clinically significant toxicity ( grade 2 bad toxicity , nonhematologic hematologic ) prior chemotherapy must great Grade 1 . 8 . Patients must follow clinical laboratory value unless consider due leukemic organ involvement : 1 ) Serum creatinine &lt; /= 2.0 mg/dl ; 2 ) Total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 time upper limit normal unless consider due Gilbert 's syndrome ; 3 ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; /= 3 time upper limit normal unless consider due organ leukemic involvement . 9 . Patients active Central Nervous System ( CNS ) disease include treat concurrently intrathecal therapy . 10 . Phase II Portion : All criterion apply . After phase I portion , patient eligibility 3 disease category accrue parallel : 1 ) AML , 2 ) MDS , 3 ) ALL . 1 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited uncontrolled infection ( i.e . persistent fever , clinical deterioration ) , acute congestive heart failure exacerbation , cardiac arrhythmia , chronic liver disease , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 2 . Active heart disease include myocardial infarction within previous 3 month , unstable angina , arrhythmias control medication , uncontrolled congestive heart failure . Patients New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 3 4 exclude . 3 . Patients receive standard investigational treatment hematologic malignancy , except permit Inclusion # 9 . 4 . Pregnant breast feeding female exclude effect bendamustine fetus nursing child unknown .</criteria>
