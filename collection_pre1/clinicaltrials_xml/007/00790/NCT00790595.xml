	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer prevalent United States , approximately 230,110 new case 29,900 death 2004 . Approximately 30 % new case clinical stage T3 diagnose . This stage high probability cancer spread beyond prostate gland , make much difficult treat . In case , surgery do prostate remove , still likely cancer spread beyond prostate remain get bad . Radiation apply prostate also work well tumor spread beyond prostate . Even surgery radiation combine eliminate problem cause prostate cancer spread tissue outside prostate . New treatment need deal prostate cancer serious stage . Study doctor believe might possible shrink prostate cancer use new drug call SUO11248 Sunitinib . After patient take drug , study doctor believe cancer shrink back within prostate , surgically remove prostate cancer . Patients study also give increase dos Sunitinib find much drug give safely .</brief_summary>
