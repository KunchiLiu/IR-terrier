	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To determine whether aspirin ( ASA ) low incidence Venous Thromboembolism ( VTE ) patient Glioblastoma ( GBM ) . Secondary objective : To determine clinical laboratory factor associate increase risk VTE If determine ASA reduces incidence VTE patient GBM , determine clinical laboratory factor associate increased benefit drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Drug : Aspirin design make blood less `` sticky '' reduce chance clot . By make blood less sticky , may less likely allow clot form . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1 2 study group . If assign Group 1 , take aspirin . If Group 2 , take placebo . A placebo substance look like study drug active ingredient . You equal chance place either group . Neither study doctor know group . In case emergency , study staff able find group . Study Drug Administration : If assign Group 1 , take 1 aspirin tablet , day , mouth . Aspirin take food may take time day . If assign Group 2 , take 1 placebo tablet day , mouth . The placebo take food may take time day . Study Visits : While study test procedure perform time routine clinical visit study doctor think may necessary . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You check VTE visit . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test least every 8 week . Blood sample routinely collect receive chemotherapy . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn see well blood clot 4 month begin treatment . If show sign VTE , test do first visit sign show . Length Study : You may remain on-study long benefiting . If disease get bad intolerable side effect occur , may take study . End Study Visit : Once off-study , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam . - You performance status evaluation . - You ask medication may take . - You check VTE . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn see well blood clot . - If symptom VTE , Doppler ultrasound test leg . Follow-up : The study staff call member family every 3 month , last clinic visit , follow health status . This investigational study . Aspirin approve FDA commercially available . Its use lowering risk VTE investigational . Aspirin , study-related tests/procedures provide free charge study . Up 224 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
