	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D ) autoimmune disease insulin-producing pancreatic beta cell destroy , result poor blood sugar control . The purpose study assess safety effectiveness low molecular weight sulfate dextran ( LMW-SD ) post-transplant islet function people T1D respond intensive insulin therapy receive kidney transplant . This study take place Uppsala Stockholm , Sweden , Oslo , Norway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Low Molecular Weight Sulfated Dextran Islet Transplantation After Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>T1D commonly treat administration insulin , either multiple insulin injection continuous supply insulin wearable pump . Insulin therapy allow long-term survival individual T1D ; however , guarantee constant normal blood sugar control . Because , long-term type 1 diabetic survivor often develop vascular complication , diabetic retinopathy , eye disease cause poor vision blindness , diabetic nephropathy , kidney disease lead kidney failure thus kidney transplant . Some individual T1D develop hypoglycemia unawareness , life-threatening condition easily treatable medication characterize reduced absent warning signal hypoglycemia . For individual , pancreas pancreatic islet transplantation possible treatment option . Rejection islets recipient 's immune system , however , make treatment ineffective . An immune response know instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction ( IBMIR ) result disruption islet integrity islet loss within hour transplantation . LMW-SD inhibits IBMIR prevent cascade trigger , combine pancreatic islet . The purpose study determine safety efficacy LMW-SD improve outcome islet transplantation prevent IBMIR . Once preparation islet become available , participant randomly assign either low molecular weight sulfate dextran ( LMW-SD ) Arm Control Group/Standard Care Arm . Participants LMW-SD Arm receive LMW-SD , 5 hour islet transplantation . Participants Control Group receive heparin islet transplantation . All participant also receive oral medication , mycophenolate mofetil sirolimus tacrolimus cyclosporine throughout study . In addition , receive either intravenous daclizumab day islet transplantation Week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 intravenous basiliximab day islet transplantation Day 4 . The islet transplantation occur hospital give via portal vein . All participant eligible receive second third islet transplantation ( ) previous transplant fail . After islet transplantation , study visit occur Days 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 75 , Months 6 12 . At visit , physical exam blood collection occur . At visit urine collection also occur .</detailed_description>
