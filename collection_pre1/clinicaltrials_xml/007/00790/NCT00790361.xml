	<brief_summary>Traumatic spinal cord injury common injury spine lead clinical syndrome call central cord syndrome ( CCS ) . CCS incomplete spinal cord injury one start lose motor function upper rather low extremity . It affect wide range population young old . However , natural history CCS poorly understood . Research show injury result CCS might due pinch compress spinal cord . This create damage part spinal cord create difficulty signal get . We believe gain good understand natural history incomplete spinal cord injury well recovery process . It possible track many change brain motor function variety method . One track concentration different chemical ( metabolite ) use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , change brain activation use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) thread-like nerve fiber spine use diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . In study detecting difference brain metabolism activation different part brain specific movement nerve fiber brain . We hypothesize decreased level N-acetylaspartate ( NAA , putative marker neuronal function ) decrease level glutamate ( primary excitatory neurotransmitter ) motor cortex patient CCS compare control . Over time , hypothesize normalization metabolite level correlate extent neurologic recovery . We also hypothesize reorganization brain activation pattern time patient show increase volume activation motor cortex recovery correlate extent neurologic outcome . Over time , predict normalization fibre track anatomy correlate neurological recovery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Natural History Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury Using fMRI , MRS DTI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term goal project develop predictor neurological recovery base brain metabolism , brain activation pattern , fibre track patient traumatic CCS . The objective preliminary study evaluate metabolic change , brain activation pattern reorganization alter spinal cord fibre track patient suffer traumatic CCS gain well understanding natural history condition . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) use investigate change brain metabolite concentration , cerebral cortical activation , fibre tract anatomy , respectively , patient control . Ten patient traumatic CCS recruit Clinical Neurological Sciences Department London Health Sciences Centre , University Campus . All participant undergo fMRI , MRS DTI scan motor cortex measure volume activation , signal intensity level NAA glutamate . The CCS participant three scan , one acutely ( 48 hour injury ) , one subacutely ( 15 day injury ) , one late ( 6 month injury ) . Healthy volunteer two scan six month apart determine reproducibility . Clinical change measure use validated disease specific score instrument include Japanese Orthopedic Association scale ( JOA ) , ASIA/ISCOS Impairment Scale , Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) . General quality life measure use 36-item Short-Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) . A blinded investigator administer instrument prior scan time point .</detailed_description>
