	<brief_title>Reducing Weight Diabetes Risk Underserved Population ( STRIDE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight obesity among leading cause preventable death US , primarily effect Type II diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease risk factor . Individuals serious mental illness represent large underserved population greatly increase risk obesity , diabetes , metabolic syndrome , subsequent early mortality . These risk amplify antipsychotic agent often prescribe treat mental condition . Although strong evidence indicate lifestyle intervention effective reduce weight diabetes risk factor general population , pilot feasibility study suggest intervention effective individual mental illness , large-scale translational trial examine intervention population .

We target group individual take antipsychotic agent ( n = 280 ) receive treatment one two clinical settingsâ€”a publicly fund behavioral health care clinic non-profit private health plan . Counselors clinical setting train intervention pair study staff deliver , increase generalizability , improve probability future adoption . The intervention promote moderate calorie reduction , dietary change , increase energy expenditure , base current clinical practice guideline treat obesity cardiovascular disease .

A fourth aim explore effect motivation , social support , outcomes expectancy primary outcome , moderator intervention effectiveness ( ethnicity , gender , mental illness diagnostic group , medication type , metabolic syndrome ) outcomes . Implementation process evaluation assess fidelity intervention delivery , evaluate acceptability ; identify component participant find least helpful ; identify barrier , facilitator , lifestyle change ; evaluate effect intervention body image , psychiatric symptom , adherence antipsychotic medication , quality life , health-related self-efficacy , health , functional status , social support . Cost-effectiveness analysis evaluate incremental cost produce change primary outcome ( weight , BMI , fast insulin level , insulin sensitivity , cholesterol ) .</detailed_description>
