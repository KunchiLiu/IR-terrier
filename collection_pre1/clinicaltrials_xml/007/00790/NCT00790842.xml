	<brief_summary>Patients previously treat multiple myeloma kidney dysfunction treat lenalidomide low-dose dexamethasone . Phase I study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together low-dose dexamethasone therapy . After maximum safe tolerate dose find Phase I , study proceed Phase II . Phase II study well treatment work patient previously treat ( relapsed refractory ) multiple myeloma kidney dysfunction . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lenalidomide together dexamethasone may kill cancer cell .

	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Low-Dose Dexamethasone Patients With Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma Kidney Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) affect approximately 20,000 Americans annually remain incurable hematologic malignancy characterize frequent early response follow universal treatment relapse necessitate multiple sequential therapeutic regimen . Until recently , effective therapy exist . Several novel agent MM become available include immunomodulatory drug thalidomide , lenalidomide , well proteasome inhibitor , bortezomib . Each agent undergo extensive clinical evaluation combination therapy produce unprecedented response rate newly diagnose relapse MM . Lenalidomide proven highly effective treatment agent , particularly use combination dexamethasone renally excrete little information available use myeloma patient impaired kidney function ( 20 % renal failure time diagnosis ) . Defining safe effective dose lenalidomide use critical step MM treatment . OUTLINE : This Phase I , dose-escalation study lenalidomide follow Phase II study . Patients stratify accord degree renal dysfunction ( moderate [ creatinine clearance 30-60 mL/min ] v severe [ creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min require dialysis ] vs end-stage renal disease [ creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min require dialysis ] ) . Patients receive oral lenalidomide day 1-21 low-dose oral dexamethasone 40 mg day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . There 7 day rest ( day 22-28 ) lenalidomide . Each cycle 28 day repeat absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients enrol phase II portion study undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic analysis lenalidomide ( Mayo Clinic site ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
