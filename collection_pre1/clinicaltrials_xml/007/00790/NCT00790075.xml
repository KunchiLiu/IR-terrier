	<brief_summary>The goal study demonstrate safety efficacy liquid risperidone psychiatrically hospitalized child , age 4-12 , would put seclusion restraint , give intramuscular injection diphenhydramine out-of-control behavior medicate risperidone . The first part study : 1 ) develop appropriate oral dos medication reduce control agitate behavior effectively few side effect , 2 ) develop rating system measure child 's behavior i.e . level improvement , sedation , untoward effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liquid Risperidone Treatment Acute Agitation Psychiatrically Hospitalized Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . Develop appropriate dose structure risperidone . Children need oral medication initially offer safe minimal dose ( 0.015 mg/kg ) dose risperidone ( 0.3 0.6mg child weigh 20-40kg ) . If response , inadequate response ( anything less `` much improve '' Clinical Global Improvement Scale ) 30 minute , next dose ( 0.02 mg/kg ) use another occasion use medication intervention follow day . Similarly , medium dose ( 0.025 mg/kg ) dose use low dose inadequate . The high dose 0.3mg/kg . For big child ( child weigh much 55kg would work maximum dose 1.6 mg/dose , well within dose range administer one time , daily basis child ( 2 mg usual maximum , though daily dose 3-4 mg uncommon ) . If child already receive risperidone , total daily dose exceed 0.07mg/kg/day ( maximum dose use RUPP trial ) . Weight dose chart follow next page . Intervention follow 30 minute depend clinical judgement . It may include different medication , open seclusion , room restriction . B . Develop rating instrument stage agitation need rat . It difficult operationalize intervene , rate improvement . There absolutely guideline . We develop list behavior nurse rater use observe child 5 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 120 minute intervention episode agitation . We , course , specifically interested measure child receive risperidone . ( It maybe necessary videotape child develop reliability measure . ) The advantage use instrument child closely observe positive negative effect . However , short term treatment trial , sedation fatigue common `` adverse event '' , follow increase appetite . Neurologic side effect ( tremor , dyskinesia , rigidity , akathesia difficulty swallow ) report chronic use medication adult . In child , placebo control study , tremor marginally common risperidone group . We anticipate 20 child 60 episode severe agitation 9 month period able find reasonable dose risperidone , determine onset duration action , efficacy shorten episode severe agitation . INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA All psychiatrically hospitalize child 12North unable take `` time '' agitate control eligible study . These child ordinarily would treat either seclusion/restraint intra-muscular shot diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) . Excluded child would allergic `` bad '' reaction risperidone past , adequate dos produce improvement behavior . Since liquid risperidone frequently use intervention unit anyway , part study , fact provide close supervision usually undertake . Close supervision require safety part project precisely document onset offset medication effect well establish pattern symptom remission . RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS The side effect frequently occur child treat every day several month medication include increase appetite , weight gain , feel tired drowsy , tremor dyskinesia . Long term use associate weight gain . There small risk extrapyramidal symptom ( akathesia , dystonia ) . This usually see dose high use study , may occur . Prolactin elevation galactorrhea rarely occur , also associate long term use . BENEFITS Development safe effective treatment severe agitation child . Development rating scale use intervention study . We reiterate intervention use child without much information close supervision follow treatment may also benefit .</detailed_description>
