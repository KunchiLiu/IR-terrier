	<detailed_description>In application , propose validate expand upon one apparent striking successes translational research . Specifically , basic research neural circuitry underlie fear extinction lead examination d-cycloserine ( DCS ) , partial agonist NMDA receptor amygdala , agent capable enhance extinction learning ( Davis et al. , 2006 ; Davis et al. , press ) . Following successful validation strategy animal laboratory ( see Ledgerwood et al. , 2005 ; Richardson et al. , 2004 ) , Ressler et al . ( 2004 ) show single dos d-cycloserine ( DCS ) could enhance extinction human exposure paradigm height phobic adult . This exciting initial finding replicate research team treatment social anxiety disorder ( Hofmann et al. , 2006 ) , well initial pilot study research team treatment panic disorder ( Tolin et al. , 2006 ; see Preliminary Studies ) . As discussed Anderson Insel ( 2006 ) , find potential foster significant advance treatment anxiety disorder . The present study represent application DCS augment effect exposure-based cognitive-behavior therapy ( CBT ) , apply treatment panic disorder without agoraphobia . In current application , propose five-year study show acute longer-term effect DCS augmentation exposure-based CBT relative placebo augmentation . Our study noteworthy use brief treatment strategy show successful previous trial ( e.g. , Clark et al. , 1999 ; Roy-Byrne et al. , 2005 ) serve basis DCS augmentation effect see pilot study application ( see Preliminary Studies ) . By demonstrate DCS enhance result even brief treatment strategy , seek validate approach fit well practice limitation application CBT effectiveness study ( e.g. , Katon et al. , 2006 ; Roy-Byrne et al . 2005 ) . Furthermore , study genetic predictor overall response CBT , DCS augmentation particular , hope elucidate nature DCS augmentation selection particularly responsive subgroup patient need . This agenda accord `` ultimate goal personalize therapy : identify individual pattern pathophysiology indicate pharmacological behavioral treatment useful individual patient '' ( Anderson &amp; Insel , 2006 , p. 320 ) . Our study design call double blind , randomize , control , trial conduct three treatment site . Patient panic disorder randomly receive DCS placebo 1 hour prior session 3-5 5-session CBT protocol include 2 additional booster session course follow-up . We enter total 192 patient 5 year identical treatment protocol follow site . Sites nonetheless differ respect study management analysis procedure .</detailed_description>
