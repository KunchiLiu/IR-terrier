	<brief_summary>According recent estimate 280,000 people United States affect uveitis year . This report , also estimate uveitis reason 30,000 new case blindness/year 10 percent case blindness . The purpose trial determine effectiveness VEGF blockade intravitreal pegaptanib patient uveitic CME .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pegaptanib Therapy Non-Infectious Uveitic Cystoid Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Cystoid macular edema common complication uveitic intraocular inflammatory disease characterize intraretinal edema involve out plexiform layer . Intraocular inflammation uveitis may associate non infectious infectious etiology . The early symptom CME include decrease blurry central vision . With long stand CME substantial risk photoreceptor degeneration ensue long term decrease quality level visual acuity ( VA ) . Furthermore show patient uveitis , morphologic feature macular edema macular thickness correlate final VA. Current therapeutic intervention best modest result patient CME decrease VA . This may case systemic intervention also . 2 . Vascular endothelial growth factor strong inducer blood vessel permeability link ocular manifestation uveitis include CME experience researcher experimental clinical setting . In animal test , VEGF show 50,000 time potent histamine , molecule commonly associate blood vessel leakage related allergy . Also animal test , show VEGF require blood vessel permeability associate neovascular AMD diabetic retinopathy show inflammatory component . In addition anti-angiogenic property inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth , pegaptanib show animal test inhibit blood vessel leak retina . Uveitis show associated ocular neovascularization clinically well clinical study . Thus , prevent blood vessel leakage well abnormal blood vessel growth pegaptanib may viable approach treatment CME . Although pegaptanib use associate mild transient anterior segment inflammation CME link use . Besides , pegaptanib demonstrate effect sustainable decrease macular edema maculopathies , age relate diabetic . 3 . There currently need consider alternative form local ( ocular ) therapy CME triamcinolone ( sub tenon intraocular ) . The serious adverse effect intraocular corticosteroid use well document include cataract ( nuclear subcapsular ) , glaucoma , endophthalmitis ( may significantly high pegaptanib patient treat exactly per protocol ) well sterile inflammatory reaction .</detailed_description>
