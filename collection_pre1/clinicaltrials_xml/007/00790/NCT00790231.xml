Motorneurons muscle locate sacral spinal cord coordination occur pontine tegmentum caudal brain stem . Motorneurons innervate external urethral sphincter locate nucleus Onuf , extend S1 S3 segment . The smooth detrusor muscle inner-vated parasympathetic fiber , reside sacral intermediolateral cell group locate S2-4 . Sympathetic fiber innervate bladder urethra play important role promote conti-nence locate intermediolateral cell group lumbar cord ( L1-L4 ) . Most afferent fiber bladder enter sacral cord pelvic nerve segment L4-S2 majority thin myelinated unmyelinated . Because peridural anesthesia perform various level spinal cord vary concentration local anesthetic , possible block portion spinal cord ( segmental blockade ) . So seem logical peridural analgesia Th 2-4 Th 10-12 influence micturition reflex . Studies urodynamic effect various anaesthetic agent rare . Under influence epidural analgesia , patient may feel urge urinate , may result urinary retention bladder distension . Spinal epidural opioid administration influence function lower urinary tract direct spinal action sacral nociceptive neuron autonomic fibre . It therefore common practice bladder catheterisation presence spinal epidural anesthesia . The excessive use transurethral catheter undoubtedly associate significant morbidity patient discomfort , urinary tract infection , catheter entrapment , bladder calculus formation , urethral trauma stricture . The risk infection single catheterization 1-2 % rise 3 7 % day . There yet consensus appropriate catheterisation strategy urodynamic change thoracic epidural anesthesia still unknown . We expect good knowledge bladder function epidural analgesia could lead restrictive use perioperative transurethral catheter . Our hypothesis thoracic epidural analgesia influence low urinary tract function male female . Therefore transurethral catheterization mandatory patient thoracic epidural analgesia . Differences post void residual urine volume urodynamic examination thoracic epidural analgesia analyze 16 men 16 woman undergo open kidney surgery/lumbotomy receive thoracic epidural anesthesia perioperatively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute urinary retention one common complication surgery anesthesia . It occur patient sexes age group type surgical procedure . It link several factor include increase intravenous fluid , postoperative pain type anesthesia . Micturition depend coordinated action detrusor muscle external urethral sphincter . Motorneurons muscle locate sacral spinal cord coordination occur pontine tegmentum caudal brain stem . Motorneurons innervate external urethral sphincter locate nucleus Onuf , extend S1 S3 segment . The detrusor smooth muscle innervate parasympathetic fiber , reside sacral intermediolateral cell group locate S2-4 . Sympathetic fiber innervate bladder urethra play important role promote continence locate intermediolateral cell group lumbar cord ( L1-L4 ) . Most afferent fiber bladder enter sacral cord pelvic nerve segment L4-S2 majority thin myelinated unmyelinated . nlike spinal anesthesia , none block , epidural anesthesia application range analgesia minimal motor block dense anesthesia ( differential blockade ) . Because epidural anesthesia perform various level spinal cord , possible block portion spinal cord ( segmental blockade ) . Therefore assumed epidural analgesia within segment Th 4-6 Th 10-12 minimal influence micturition reflex . There study urodynamic effect various anaesthetic agent , focus lumbar epidural anaesthesia . Under influence epidural analgesia , patient may feel urge urinate , result urinary retention bladder overdistension . Overfilling bladder stretch damage detrusor muscle . For example , use lumbar epidural analgesia labor delivery frequently implicate causative factor postpartum urinary retention . This supported fact patient demonstrate difficulty voiding . Spinal epidural opioid administration influence function lower urinary tract direct spinal action sacral nociceptive neuron autonomic fibre . Long act local anesthetic administrate intrathecally rapidly block micturition reflex . Detrusor contraction restore approximately 7-8 hour spinal injection bupivacaine . For reason , bladder catheterisation common practice patient spinal epidural anesthesia.The use transurethral catheter associate significant morbidity patient discomfort , urinary tract infection , urethral trauma stricture . The risk infection single catheterization 1-2 % rise 3 7 % every additional day indwell catheter . Traumatic prolong catheterization may lead urethritis urethral stricture . There yet consensus appropriate catheterisation strategy regional anesthesia . We expect good knowledge bladder function epidural analgesia could lead restrictive use perioperative transurethral catheters.Urodynamic change thoracic epidural anaesthesia still unknown . The aim study compare low urinary tract function thoracic epidural analgesia within segment Th4-6 Th 10-12 postoperative pain treatment patient undergo lumbotomy kidney surgery .</detailed_description>
