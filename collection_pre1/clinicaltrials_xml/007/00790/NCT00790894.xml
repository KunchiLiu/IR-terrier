	<detailed_description>Patients measurable metastatic breast cancer treat adjuvant neo-adjuvant setting chemotherapy consider study . Subjects must receive cytotoxic chemotherapy locally recurrent/metastatic disease . Patients fulfil eligibility criterion , sign inform consent trial centrally randomize electronic mean one two ixabepilone treatment arm . Stratification factor include : time recurrence adjuvant treatment , calculate date last dose adjuvant treatment date relapse ( ≤ 1 year vs. &gt; 1 year ) ; previous chemotherapy taxane regimen neo-adjuvant adjuvant setting ( yes vs. ) .
