	<brief_summary>The present investigation Phase II , single center , placebo-controlled , randomize , dose escalation , infusion modality ( intracoronary v transendocardial injection use Cordis Biosense NOGASTAR TM Mapping Catheter Biosense MYOSTAR TM leave ventricular injection catheter ) transplantation autologous ( stem cell ) combination bone marrow-derived stem cell myocardium treatment severe coronary ischemia . The purpose research study determine infusion combination stem cell obtain bone marrow patient contribute formation new blood vessel patient symptomatic severe coronary ischemia ( CI ) . In trial determine whether combination stem cell treatment safe , feasible result development mature stable and/or collateral vessel improvement cardiac function . Coronary Ischemia ( CI ) intractable angina due severe coronary artery disease seriously decrease blood flow heart . CI need comprehensive treatment since condition improve . The overall goal treatment increase blood flow heart improve symptom angina . The study hypothesis base concept process formation new blood vessel complex require participation several type stem cell growth factor . The lack component produce vessel immature unable provide appropriate blood supply heart . Patients eligible participate study suffer severe blockage vessel heart candidate percutaneous revascularization surgical procedure .</brief_summary>

Treatment Group A ( 30 individual , include patient placebo control ) receive product intracoronary infusion , 2 . Treatment Group B ( 30 individual , include patient placebo control ) receive product transendocardial injection . In turn , Treatment Group consist 2 subgroup individual receive infusion one two dos establish cell product : 3 . In treatment SubGroup 1 , 10 individual receive `` low dose '' cell product 5 individual receive placebo product . 4 . In treatment SubGroup 2 , 10 individual receive `` high dose '' cell product 5 individual receive placebo product</detailed_description>
