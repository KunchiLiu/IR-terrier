	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis inflammatory bowel disease afflict one million people U.S . Symptoms include rectal urgency , bloody diarrhea , moderate severe abdominal pain , fever , fatigue . Melatonin hormone associate sleep body function may relate health . Melatonin produce pineal gland , fact , produce even great amount gut . Melatonin appear important gastrointestinal tract physiology health , data cell animal experiment , study human , suggest supplemental melatonin may help ameliorate colitis . Given current treatment ulcerative colitis always effective , often serious side effect , considerable interest find alternative treatment disease . However , experimental data ability melatonin improve ulcerative colitis human lack . To address , plan conduct pilot clinical trial ( 60 adult male female participant ) obtain preliminary data effectiveness melatonin supplementation treatment ulcerative colitis adult men woman disease . The `` Melatonin Ulcerative Colitis '' study fund grant Broad Foundation 's Broad Medical Research Program ( http : //www.broadmedical.org ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Problem Interest : Current treatment ulcerative colitis always effective , often serious side effect . Therefore , considerable interest find alternative treatment disease . Physiologic data suggest melatonin important gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract physiology health , data vitro study , animal experiment , study humans suggest supplemental melatonin may ameliorative effect colitis . However , experimental data ability melatonin improve ulcerative colitis human lack . The long-term goal proposal examine whether melatonin supplementation help alleviate mild-to-moderate colitis symptom . To end , plan conduct pilot randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial ( n = 60 ) obtain preliminary data effectiveness melatonin supplementation treatment ulcerative colitis adult men woman mild moderate flare-up disease . The specific aim trial : ( ) estimate effect 12 week 5 mg/day supplementation melatonin ulcerative colitis remission , ( ii ) estimate effect melatonin supplementation tissue level cytokines marker inflammation , ( iii ) determine whether melatonin 's effect vary accord baseline ( endogenous ) melatonin level , ( iv ) determine feasibility recruit retain sufficient number ulcerative colitis patient large , definitive study , ( v ) determine whether melatonin supplementation adverse side-effects take daily 12 week adults ulcerative colitis . How Problem Will Be Studied : The overall study design trial randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial . Patients recruit see IBD clinician one three study site : Emory University , Atlanta Gastroenterology Associates , Atlanta VA Medical Center . Eligibility base first severity disease , determine physician exam , sigmoidoscopy ( part Mayo Scoring System ) . The Project Coordinator meet patient determine eligibility , restriction base age , medical history , medication take , pregnancy , others . Willing patient otherwise eligible point undergo one-week placebo run-in ass compliance report side-effects . Eligible patient undergo first study sigmoidoscopy , provide biological sample process ( blood , urine , rectal biopsy tissue ) , randomize treatment ( 5 mg/d bedtime ) placebo ( also bedtime ) . They give sleep log symptom log fill weekly trial , fill colitis-related quality life questionnaire . They call per week Project Coordinator check study participant , assess compliance side-effects , answer question . There clinical visit two week randomization , ass symptom side effect . The next scheduled clinical visit end trial , another sigmoidoscopy sample collection take place . Any interim clinical visit discretion patient study physician . Lastly , patient complete questionnaire colitis-related quality life trial ask whether suspect treatment arm . The following period devote data analysis , publication study result , closeout . Please see attach protocol detail . Importance Knowledge Gained : The propose research public health scientific importance . Ulcerative colitis rare condition , sufferer often deal debilitate symptom . Thus , great understand way treat ulcerative colitis would potential relevance great number people . How Research Will Advance Scientific Knowledge and/or Human Health UC common gastrointestinal disorder adult , one debilitating symptom severe health consequence . Current treatment always effective , often serious side effect . Therefore , considerable interest find alternative treatment disease . Physiologic data suggest melatonin important GI tract physiology health , data vitro study , animal experiment , study human , suggest supplemental melatonin may ameliorative effect colitis . Given newly-funded pilot clinical trial award maximum funding available Broad Foundation , fund allocate explore potentially important biological mechanism , feel excellent opportunity validate potential clinical benefit melatonin adjunctive therapy UC human , mechanistic insight various level inflammatory process may influence melatonin vivo . Thus , propose study ) innovative , b ) support experimental data , c ) may ultimately lead improved treatment UC base clinical mechanistic knowledge gain study conduct human patient . To date , formal clinical trial melatonin therapy UC human , mechanistic investigation potential mode action compound pathomechanisms identify thus far . Given low toxicity document even high level melatonin animal human subject , relatively inexpensive treatment may represent attractive alternative patient suffer mild mid-grade UC give low incidence side effect .</detailed_description>
