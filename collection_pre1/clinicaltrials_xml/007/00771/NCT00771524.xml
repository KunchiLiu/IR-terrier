	<brief_summary>This study perform measure amount antibiotic ceftobiprole ( study drug ) find bone blood receive one dose prior elective hip replacement surgery . A piece hip bone remove part surgery analyze determine much ceftobiprole get bone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study Penetration Ceftobiprole Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 20 patient take part study . Two patient receive ceftobiprole , receive antibiotic normally give prior elective hip replacement surgery . The remain 18 patient receive ceftobiprole 500 mg drip vein 2 hour . All patient sample bone take surgery blood sample take specific timepoints . The sample take 2 patient receive study drug assist development test use measure study drug bone sample . This open-label , parallel group , pharmacokinetic study healthy men woman clear medically elective total hip replacement surgery . Healthy define patient medically stable clear elective surgery . The study 4 phase : screen phase 21 day day surgery ; pretreatment phase 7 day day surgery ; 1-day open-label treatment phase ; end-of-study phase ( end-of-study procedure time early withdrawal ) ; follow-up telephone contact approximately 1 week surgery assess new ongoing adverse event . Two control subject enrol ; patient receive ceftobiprole , undergo surgery bone sample , serve control qualify bioanalytical assay . The remain 36 patient randomize 1 2 ceftobiprole treatment . The primary objective estimate penetration ceftobiprole bone otherwise healthy patient undergoing total hip replacement surgery . Safety tolerability also assess . Venous blood sample collect analyzed ceftobiprole concentration use validated liquid-chromatography methodology , tandem mass spectrometric detection . Bone sample analyze ceftobiprole qualify liquid-chromatography methodology , tandem mass spectrometric detection . Safety tolerability evaluate throughout study . Blood drawn clinical laboratory test PK evaluation . A single dose ceftobiprole 500 mg drip vein 2 hour , administer prior elective hip replacement surgery .</detailed_description>
