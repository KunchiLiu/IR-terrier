	<brief_title>Prospective Pilot Study Pre-Transplant Thymoglobulin Administration Living Donor Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We evaluate therapeutic efficacy administer ThymoglobulinÂ® induction pre-transplantation renal allograft recipient . Patients receive pre-transplant Thymoglobulin evaluate acute rejection ( Banff '97 criterion ) , survival , safety 6 month . Overall use Thymoglobulin induction pre-transplantation safe effective .</detailed_description>
