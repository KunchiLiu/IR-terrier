	<brief_summary>Intra-operative colonoscopy ( insert flexible endoscope camera tip anus rectum colon ) often indicated locate verify location small cancer , polyp , bleed site , simply inspect bowel two end rejoin together . Usually colonoscopy utilizes ambient air expand inflate colon , result , leave colon bloat distend gas either expel absorbed . This endoscopy relate bowel distension problematic set traditional open ( big incision ) colorectal surgery minimally invasive ( laparoscopic assist ) procedure . In case former , may prove difficult close traditional laparotomy incision bowel distend may hinder respiration abdomen close . In set laparoscopic procedure , bowel distension limit work space available surgeon . Since laparoscopic domain limit , distend colon follow intra-operative colonoscopy prevent minimally invasive completion case ( mean conversion traditional `` open '' method would necessary ) otherwise go well good prospect laparoscopic completion . Colonic distension also cause abdominal pain lengthen recovery time procedure . The investigator believe use CO2 intra-operative colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy ( exam last 2 2 ½ foot colon ) cause long last bloat distension colon oppose air . Carbon dioxide absorb 250 time faster ambient air may decrease procedure colonic distension . This prospective , randomize study compare two gas term colonic distension . Patients undergo open minimally invasive colorectal resection randomize undergo intra-operative colonoscopy use one two gas . Direct measurement colon diameter take specific time interval colonoscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparision Air Versus CO2 Distention During Sigmoidoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopic examination large bowel ( insert flexible endoscope camera tip anus rectum colon ) sometimes required colorectal resection ( abdominal operation remove segment piece colon rectum ) order find small cancer , polyp , bleed site , simply inspect bowel two end rejoin together . In order get good look large intestine colonoscope necessary pump gas colon via scope order distend inflate . The gas almost universally used room air . Since hard , impossible , fully suction gas colon exam finish , colon usually quite bloated distend colonoscopy . This dilatation persist hour day since air well absorb bowel wall body . A distended colon cause problem traditional open ( big incision ) surgery laparoscopicassisted ( minimally invasive ) surgery . During big incision operation , colonic distension swell make hard close incision end operation make breathing difficult . In contrast , laparoscopic procedure , colorectal dilatation greatly decrease amount work maneuvering room available surgeon point laparoscopic approach may abandon favor big incision method . Thus , colon distension follow sigmoidoscopy do air abdominal operation cause problem patient surgeon . An alternative gas pump colon colonoscopy carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . Unlike air , CO2 rapidly reabsorb body colon , 250 time faster air . There machine available make possible easily safely use CO2 gas distend colon colonoscopy . The investigator believe use CO2 intraoperative colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy ( exam last 2 2 ½ foot colon ) cause long last bloat distension colon oppose air . Patients undergo either open ( big incision ) laparoscopic ( multiple small incision ) rectal sigmoid colon resection usually need intraoperative sigmoidoscopy end operation inspect inside colon rectum check air leak vicinity rejoin point ( anastomosis ) . In study one half patient , flip coin , get CO2 sigmoidoscopy remain half air use inflated colon examination . After sigmoidoscopic exam complete scope remove , without suction , colon diameter near rectum measure surgeon look work abdomen . The size colon measure every 5 minute next 20 minute surgeon prepare close abdomen end surgery . At end 20 minute period , colon remain distended , scope reinserted excess gas suction . The surgeon carry study believe colon patient get CO2 gas sigmoidiscopy rapidly shrink size towards original diameter patient get air pump colon .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patient , age 18 , undergo elective , open minimally invasive ( laparoscopicassistedor handassisted ) leave sided colorectal resection , indication , anticipate transanal circular , staple colorectal anastomosis construct eligible enrollment study , provide able understand sign Informed Consent Form . Patients identify preoperatively anticipation undergo operation detail . Patients undergo right side , transverse , descend colectomy eligible since anastomosis would carry transanally place circular stapler . Patients undergo abdominoperineal resection ( include anastomosis ) also eligible . Patients severe COPD emphysema would eligible entry study . Further , patient undergo emergent surgery elective patient ASA Class 3 4 eligible study .</criteria>
