	<brief_summary>The primary objective determine anti-tumor activity combination apricoxib + either docetaxel ( AP/DC ) pemetrexed ( AP/PE ) compare placebo + either docetaxel ( P/DC ) pemetrexed ( P/PE ) measure progression free survival patient Stage IIIb ( pleural effusion ) Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>0822GCC : Phase 2 Study Efficacy Safety Apricoxib/Placebo With Docetaxel Pemetrexed Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnose advanced non-small cell lung cancer respond platinum-based chemotherapy eligible particvpate study . Current standard treatment type lung cancer generally effective prevent cancer grow . The purpose study see add drug apricoxib standard chemotherapy effective treting NSCLC . Apricoxib investigational drug . Investigational mean approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Laboratory study suggest apricoxib may useful treatment cancer . This see particularly combine chemotherapy drug . However , proven human . Laboratory evidence indicate apricoxib may benefit patient whose disease over-produces substance call COX-2 . COX-2 detect urine substance call PGE-M ( prostaglandin E metabolite ) . It think patient PGE-M level urine decrease least half take apricoxib may benefit patient whose urine PGE-M decrease less half apricoxib . This study evaluate whether add apricoxib standard chemotherapy treatment improve outcome patient non-small cell lung cancer whose urine PGE-M decrease least 50 % take apricoxib . Apricoxib placebo add either docetaxel pemetrexed treatment .</detailed_description>
