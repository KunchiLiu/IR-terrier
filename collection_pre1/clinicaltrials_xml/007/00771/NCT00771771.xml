	<brief_title>Early Supported Discharge After Stroke Bergen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early support discharge ( ESD ) seem least effective hospital rehabilitation stroke , possibly well . In study patient recent stroke randomize one three different treatment arm : - ESD treatment day institution 4 hr . per day 5 week - ESD treatment patient ' home 4 hr . per day 5 week - Rehabilitation treatment `` usual '' , long hospital stay , without specific treatment follow-up discharge The patient two ESD arm addition follow closely multidisciplinary coordinating team stay hospital 5 week period treatment discharge , offer follow-ups 3 6 month inclusion study . Patients 3 arm systematically examine set measuring instrument well objective physical function test . This perform inclusion 3 , 6 , 12 24 month inclusion . In collaborate study physiotherapist Bente Gjelsvik comparison change trunk control , balance , walk ADL 3 month post stroke , well patient ' perception physical function , pain fatigue , main focus . To assess function , functional change possible difference different intervention , need reliable valid outcome measure . As basis use outcome measure Trunk Impairment Scale ( TIS ) study , TIS translate Norwegian , Trunk Impairment Scale - Norwegian version ( TIS-NV ) examine measurement property use data study well data patient brain damage recruit Department Physical Rehabilitation Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital . An examination possible connection localisation size stroke trunk control also perform , characteristic stroke may therapeutic implication choice intervention individual patient . The research question plan doctoral thesis Bente Gjelsvik therefore follow : 1 . Is TIS-NV reliable valid patient brain damage ? 2 . Are change trunk control , balance , walk daily activity , well pain fatigue 3 month post stroke different patient receive intervention different course rehabilitation study `` Early support discharge stroke Bergen '' ? To degree patient perceive problem related balance , physical activity , walking , pain fatigue ? 3 . Is correlation localization size stroke measure magnetic tomography , patient ' trunk control ? Are initial localization size stroke predictive patient ' trunk control 3 month post stroke ? Another collaborating project carry PhD candidate Hedda DÃ¸li ( Language outcome stroke : lesion location , prognosis consequence ) . The aim first study PhD project investigate relationship lesion location aphasia severity one week post-stroke . Thereafter follow-up study patient 12 month post-stroke investigates prognosis aphasia variable may influence recovery . In third study aim investigate health-related quality life occurrence depression patient aphasia .</detailed_description>
