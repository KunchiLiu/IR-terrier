	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find well Campath ( alemtuzumab ) , Rituxan ( rituximab ) , combination 2 drug may control Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) leave chemotherapy . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab + Rituximab Consolidation CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : Alemtuzumab rituximab monoclonal antibody . Monoclonal antibody protein design attach protein surface leukemia cell . By attach leukemia cell , monoclonal antibody alert immune system target cell kill . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 3 group . Group 1 receive rituximab alone . Group 2 receive alemtuzumab alone . Group 3 receive drug together . At begin study , chance assign group equal . However , enough participant study response rate group know , slightly good chance assign group high response rate . Study Drug Administration : Group 1 : If Group 1 , rituximab give needle vein 1 time week 4 week . The first time receive rituximab , give 4-6 hour . Depending side effect may , late infusion may give 2-4 hour . Before dose rituximab , receive drug benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) , Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) , sometimes steroid ( either mouth vein ) try prevent and/or help control side effect fever chill . To help prevent infection , take antibiotic valacyclovir ( similar drug ) . Valacyclovir take 1 time day every day . Your doctor describe detail . Group 2 : If Group 2 , alemtuzumab give injection skin 3 time week 13 week . You come clinic dose , learn inject , someone else teach inject . To help prevent infection , take antibiotic trimethoprin/sulfamethoxazole ( SMX ) . Your doctor tell take tablet 2 time day either 3 time week ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) 2 time week ( Saturday Sunday ) . You also take either antibiotic valganciclovir valacyclovir . Valganciclovir tablets take 2 time every day . Valacyclovir take 1 time day every day . You continue take antibiotic least 3 month last dose alemtuzumab . Group 3 : If Group 3 , rituximab give needle vein 1 time week 4 week . The first time receive rituximab , give 4-6 hour . Depending side effect may , late infusion may give 2-4 hour . Alemtuzumab give injection skin 3 time week 13 week . You come clinic dose , learn inject , someone else teach inject . Before dose rituximab , receive drug benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) , Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) , sometimes steroid ( either mouth vein ) try prevent and/or help control side effect . To help prevent infection , take antibiotic trimethoprin/sulfamethoxazole ( SMX ) . Your doctor tell take tablet 2 time day either 3 time week ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) 2 time week ( Saturday Sunday ) . You also take either antibiotic valganciclovir valacyclovir . Valganciclovir tablets take 2 time every day . Valacyclovir take 1 time day every day . You continue take antibiotic least 3 month last dose alemtuzumab . Study Visits : Every week receive therapy , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Six ( 6 ) , 12 , 18 week ( +/- 1 week ) begin receive study drug ( ) every 6 month ( +/- 1 month ) , bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate check status disease check residual disease . Every 6 month ( +/- 3 month ) stop receive therapy , physical exam blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . If Group 2 3 , Week 3 6 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection . This infection may occur people weaken immune system . If doctor think necessary , chest x-ray and/or scan . Length Study : If Group 1 , take study drug 4 week . If Groups 2 3 , take study drug ( ) 13 week . You take treatment early intolerable side effect . You remain study long disease get bad . This investigational study . Rituximab FDA approve commercially available non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . However , approve treatment CLL . Alemtuzumab FDA approve commercially available . It approve treatment CLL give vein . It approve give injection skin treatment chemotherapy . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
