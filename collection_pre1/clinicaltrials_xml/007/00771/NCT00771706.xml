For chronic cough , define cough last 3 week , differential diagnosis broad , include self-limited , persistent , chronic disease . The success give treatment depend upon proper diagnosis , yet often obvious . Gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) propose one possible etiology chronic cough number study adult literature ; nevertheless clear cause effect remain confirmed continue gold standard test definitively identify pathologic GER . Each year , billion dollar direct towards diagnose treat GER relate adult child chronic cough without solid proof effect . We propose test null hypothesis causative role GER regard etiology chronic cough child . If null hypothesis prove true , important medical economic ramification , would suggest treatment acid reflux chronic cough child unwarranted . With conclusion , health care cost would reduce child spar inappropriate medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction 1.1 . Cough Cough important physiologic component lung defense cardinal indicator disease . It second common reason medical visit childhood . The metamorphosis cough normal pathologic event occur along gradient include frequency , character duration.1 When consider age child , characteristic inform decision diagnosis management . For chronic cough , define cough last 3 weeks2 , differential diagnosis broad , include self-limited , persistent , chronic disease . An isolated cough otherwise healthy child may secondary recurrent viral bronchiolitis , post-infectious etiology , pertussis , cough variant asthma , post-nasal drip , may psychogenic origin . Possible significant underlying cause cough include cystic fibrosis , primary ciliary dyskinesia , immune deficiency , chronic bronchitis , retain foreign body , airway lesion , tracheomalacia , extrinsic compression airway3 . Gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) also include differential diagnosis chronic cough child . Specific Aims 1 . To conduct randomize , placebo control trial test null hypothesis treatment child chronic cough 3 week ' duration effect medicine design specifically treat gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) extraesophageal manifestation . 2 . To utilize `` gold standard population '' ( identify protocol outline specific aim number 1 ) use logistic regression analysis identify test currently employ identify GER employ within statistically sound predictive model . Patient Recruitment : Children age 2 18 year see primary care pediatrician within one Massachusetts General Hospital Children ( MGHfC ) associate practice chronic cough three week great duration candidate recruitment study . The MGHfC approximately 260 community base pediatric practice within great Boston region . Children also recruit hospital base well satellite clinic division Pediatric Gastroenterology Pediatric Pulmonology MGHfC well division Pediatric Otolaryngology Massachusetts Eye Ear Infirmary ( MEEI ) . Children evaluate first pediatrician team Pediatric otolaryngologist , gastroenterologist , pulmonologists identifiable cause chronic cough . These child exclude entry propose study . Children 1 ) identifiable treatable cause cough 2 ) suspect GER possible etiology cough suggest history physical examination remain candidate recruitment . Children clear diagnosis establish describe protocol generally undergo series diagnostic endoscopy perform three clinical service simultaneously ( current standard MEEI/MGHfC Pediatric Airway , Voice , Swallowing Center ) include direct laryngoscopy , bronchoscopy culture bronchoalveolar lavage , esophagogastroduodenoscopy biopsy , placement ambulatory impedance double pH probe monitoring . It point inform consent take procedure patient caregiver recruit study Massachusetts Eye Ear Infirmary . ( site office endoscopic visit ) . The point randomization occurs time endoscopy ; administration either PPI placebo begin day follow endoscopy continue three week time interval time first post-operative office visit . Caregivers child schedule diagnostic endoscopy meet P.I . ( CJH ) well nurse coordinator study review Informed Consent Form Informed Assent Form child age 8 ( standard MEEI ; inform consent form also obtain caregiver child ) . A datasheet record caregiver opt enter study identify enroll issue potentially address issue patient accrual achieve adequate sample size . Primary Study Objectives : The primary study objective : 1 . To compare cough reduction rate use either PPI placebo child chronic cough 2 . To compare adverse event report caregiver child treat PPI therapy oppose placebo The study design base upon non-parametric outcome variable permit Wilcoxon Rank Sum calculation . The propose RCT design provide 90 % statistical power show significant difference clinical outcome attributable PPI administration assume 5 point treatment difference sum question CQ . The null hypothesis test significant difference cough reduction rate child chronic cough treat either placebo PPI therapy .</detailed_description>
