	<detailed_description>In Crohn 's disease inflammation ( change body tissue normally happen injury infection ) ulceration ( open sore ) intestines.This occur immune system ( part body fight infection ) abnormal overactive response intestine bowel tissue body . Crohn 's disease usually treat medication either directly decrease inflammation decrease general activity immune system improve diarrhea , abdominal pain , symptoms Crohn 's Disease . Ustekinumab antibody ( natural substance make immune system stick help remove foreign material body cause disease ) create stick block activity two immune substance think cause abnormal inflammation Crohn 's disease . Patients eligible receive Remicade , Humira , Cimzia fail intolerant one drug randomize either active drug ( ustekinumab ) placebo . All patient randomize ( like flip coin ) week 0 one 4 group . At week 0 study drug give IV administration week 8 16 subcutaneous injection . There 11 study visit total study continue week 36 . Blood stool sample collect studied , questionnaires check term disease complete , Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) obtain , safety evaluation conduct diary card distribute complete entire study . One 4 group : Grp 1-placebo , Grp 2-active drug 1mg/kg IV , Grp 3-active drug 3mg/kg IV , Grp 4-active drug 6mg/kg IV . Based clinical response status Week 6 , patient Grps 2 , 3 4 re-randomized week 8 receive either placebo 90 mg SC week 8 16 patient Grp 1 receive placebo Week 8 Week 16 270 mg SC injection Week 8 90 mg SC Week 16 .</detailed_description>
