	<brief_title>Exercise Dose Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) affect 33 % adult United States . The prevalence NAFLD four five time high obese lean person associate insulin resistance metabolic syndrome . Decreasing calorie intake increase physical activity recommend primary therapy NAFLD , independent effect aerobic exercise unknown . The current exercise guideline disease prevention weight management range 150 min/wk , recommend Centers Disease Control American College Sports Medicine , 300 min/wk , recommend Institute Medicine . However , know whether aerobic exercise alone improve NAFLD , recommend dose exercise might beneficial effect . The purpose proposal determine effect moderate intensity endurance exercise : 1 ) hepatic fat content ; 2 ) hepatic lipoprotein kinetics ; 3 ) plasma inflammatory marker . We hypothesize aerobic exercise decrease hepatic fat content , improve VLDL kinetics , decrease inflammation dose-dependent fashion . The result study help determine exercise guideline obese patient NAFLD , lay groundwork future study evaluate effect exercise metabolic disease associate obesity . This proposal involve conduct randomize controlled trial randomize obese subject NAFLD ( &gt; 10 % hepatic fat content ) one two group : Group 1 ( Control , exercise ) Group 2 ( Moderate Intensity Aerobic Exercise- 150 min/wk 300 min/wk supervise exercise perform 45-55 % O2 max ) .</detailed_description>
