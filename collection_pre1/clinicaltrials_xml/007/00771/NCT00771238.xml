Subjects experience either development pressure ulcer , worsen skin and/or exist pressure ulcer point specialty bed deem require wound team staff consider treatment failure , place appropriate mattress identify treat staff hospital admit condition . If mattress rental therapy mattress , estimate cost rent product calculate patient move onto rental mattress . An assessment skin care protocol adherence perform Wound Care team daily basis subject audit percent prescribed measure implement . If subject require rental therapy bed pressure ulcer development , cost associate rental estimate ( # day x average dollar value ) . These cost compare rental group .</detailed_description>
