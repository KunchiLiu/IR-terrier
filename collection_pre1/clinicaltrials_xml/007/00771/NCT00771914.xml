	<brief_title>The Effects Omega-3 Fatty Acids Aspirin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although aspirin stalwart treatment prevention treatment myocardial infarction stroke , expect effect significant proportion population . This phenomenon term `` aspirin resistance '' . Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation associate reduce risk sudden cardiac death myocardial infarction . The beneficial effect omega-3s consider partially due ability prevent platelet aggregation . However , ability omega-3s enhance effect aspirin suffer aspirin resistance determine . It known aspirin stimulates production potent lipid mediator omega-3 fatty acid mediator powerful antiinflammatory tissue-protective effect . Thus , treatment individual high risk myocardial infarction stroke aspirin pharmaceutical-grade omega-3 fatty acid medication may powerful combination prevention treatment life-threatening cardiovascular disease . Study Protocol : Non-smoking male female subject age 18 50 take medication , vitamin pill , nutritional supplement , herbal preparation recruit . Subjects history chronic disease ( e.g . cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , neurodegenerative , neoplastic , metabolic { diabetes } , hypertension ; base screen medical history , complete blood count , comprehensive metabolic profile ) , allergic reaction aspirin , fish , fish oil , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug exclude . Other exclusion include drinking three alcoholic beverage day , follow condition : ulcer bleed stomach , liver kidney disease , bleed blood clot disorder ( e.g . hemophilia ) , congestive heart failure , fluid retention , high blood pressure , gout , asthma , arthritis , nasal polyp . This randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blinded trial cross-over design . Each subject serve his/her control . The study involve four visit four week apart , host University Rochester Clinical Research Center . At separate study visit , subject receive ( use randomize protocol ) placebo , 81 mg aspirin , 4 g Lovaza ( R ) ( 3.4g EPA+DHA ) , aspirin Lovaza ( R ) . Thus , subject receive treatment individually random fashion four visit . Subjects , Center staff , investigator blind treatment give visit ensure study pharmacist make tablet capsule treatment appear identical . Prior visit , subject eat standard low-fat dinner prior evening , fast least 8 hour prior arrival Center . Subjects require abstain take aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 10 day prior visit omega-3 fatty acid 30 day prior baseline study visit , subsequent clinic visit . Visits last approximately 6 hour , subject bedrest . A venous catheter place peripheral vein ( saline lock , 18 gauge large , { heparin use } forearm ) blood drawn , baseline 4 hour post-treatment , citrated tube visit Platelet Function Analyzer-100 ( PFA-100-Siemens , Deerfield , IL ) closure time test . Subjects provide standard low-fat breakfast baseline phlebotomy .</detailed_description>
