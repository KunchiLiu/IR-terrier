	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop robust , low-power , stable , light weight , active knee prosthetic device dramatically increase gait symmetry walk economy transfemoral amputee walk . State art prosthetic knee classify three main class : ) mechanically passive , b ) variable-damping , c ) power . Although device within class offer advantage above-knee amputee , overall performance still present deficiency . Artificial knee first two group predominantly damp device , incapable provide positive power output . Moreover , current power prosthesis heavy inefficient energy consumption , and/or limited range motion . To overcome inadequacy , design novel prosthetic knee device biomimetic approach . The design active knee prosthesis inspire antagonistic muscle anatomy human knee joint . This device mimic synergistic muscle activity knee use double series-elastic actuator ( SEA ) system resemble major mono-articular muscle group help flex extend knee joint . The agonist-antagonist SEA knee architecture allow precise force control knee joint , mimic spring-like behavior human knee , well provide adequate energy forward progression body . The SEA previously develop test legged robot . Also , SEA successfully apply development actuate ankle-foot orthoses ( AAFO ) MIT AI Lab . The mechanical architecture active knee prosthesis allow independent engagement flexion extension tendon-like , series spring control joint position impedance , well net joint torque . Furthermore , architecture permit joint rotation near zero friction , allow controller take advantage passive dynamic system , thus , augment overall energetic efficiency system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Active Knee Prosthesis Study Improvement Locomotion Above Knee Amputees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy participant above-knee amputation recruit . Participants meet follow eligibility criterion . They experience prosthesis ambulation , capacity ambulation least K3 level ( i.e . ability potential ambulation variable cadence ) . Additionally , amputee participant generally healthy musculoskeletal problem know cardiovascular , pulmonary neurological disorder . The research objective evaluate efficacy active knee prosthesis design increase gait symmetry , speed , low metabolic energy demand walk . For amputee participant , complete study include three separate experimental session conduct three different location . These location : The Biomechatronics Group , MIT Media Laboratory ; Holodeck room CSAIL MIT ; Indoor Track MIT 's Johnson Athletic Center . The time experimental session approximately one two week time duration session two three hour . For session , amputee study participant ask walk slow , normal , fast pace two different condition . The experimental condition : 1 . Using assign commercially , available knee prosthesis ( e.g . Otto Bock C-Leg Ossur Rheo ) 2 . Using active knee prosthesis In first session , amputee participant schedule visit Biomechatronics Group The MIT Media Laboratory . The main purpose session qualitatively assess degree active prosthesis improve amputee gait . Morphological data ( example , height , weight , limb length circumference ) participant record use biomechanical data collection form . These data use analysis data gather gait research session . Each participant ask walk along 30-foot level walkway Biomechatronics Group . During session , participant ask walk slow , normal fast pace two walk condition . For condition speed , approximately 10-15 trial perform . Parallel bar utilized prevent injury subject lose balance fall . A safely harness attach ceiling also utilized subject make request . In addition , member laboratory staff also accompany study participant catch event fall , necessary . The participant may ask rest terminate participation study time . Each participant walk platform 60-90 time entire first session , take approximately 2 hour . When use active prosthesis walk program , researcher tune parameter walk program participant 's gait pattern . The parameter use tune walk program record use Sessions 2 3 . In second session , amputee study participant schedule visit Holodeck room CSAIL MIT ( Rm 33-339 ) , instal motion capture system measure human movement . The main purpose session collect knee state , torque power amputee walk slow , moderate fast speed . These active knee prosthetic data compare conventional prosthetic knee behavior measure three speed . Each participant ask walk along 30-foot level walkway Holodeck room CSAIL MIT . Before conduct experiment , one investigator place reflective marker participant 's skin tape specific point joint body . These special marker see camera room ( See Data Collection Instruments ) . During session , participant ask walk slow , normal fast pace two walk condition . For condition speed , approximately 10-15 trial perform . Motion data collect cameras room force plate place walkway . As device setup first session , two member laboratory staff walk side participant throughout experiment . The second session take 2 3 hour . In third session , transfemoral amputee participant schedule visit Indoor Track Johnson Athletic Center MIT , locate 2nd floor Athletic Center . The main purpose session test active knee prosthesis , fact , reduce metabolic cost amputee walk . During session , participant ask wear Cosmed Oxygen Consumption ( VO2 ) mask measure metabolic rate . Two member laboratory staff walk side participant throughout experiment . The procedure experiment follow : The participant ask wear VO2 system first walk 8 minute track assign commercially , available knee prosthesis ( Otto Bock C-Leg Ossur Rheo ) establish control metabolic rate . After rest 8 minute , he/she wear active prosthesis get acclimate device walk 5 minute . He/she walk track 8 minute measure his/her metabolic rate device . The participant rest another 8 minute . This protocol repeat two additional time , entire experiment take approximately 3 Hrs . Throughout study , participant videotape photographed document effect prosthesis walking .</detailed_description>
