	<brief_summary>Both Type 1 Type 2 diabetes ( T1DM T2DM ) develop impaired insulin production . The amount insulin produce , amount insulin produce beta cell thepancreas level insulin glucose blood , however , imperfectly correlate . The development reliable method noninvasively quantitate beta cell mass ( BCM ) would great benefit provide important endpoint development new treatment T1DM T2DM . We previously identify specific marker islet cell call VMAT2 propose use positron emission tomography ( P.E.T . ) scan determine islet cell mass . This radioligand , [ 11C ] DTBZ , use previously human subject clinical trial evaluate P.E.T scan brain patient bipolar illness schizophrenia compare healthy control subject . We hypothesize P.E.T scan able differentiate normal , reduce increase BCM human subject . Subjects normal BCM recruit among normal weight nondiabetic people plasma insulin level within normal range . Subjects predict reduced BCM recruit among patient T1DM low measurable insulin level . If result nondiabetic subject subject T1DM find differ significantly , subject increase BCM recruit among patient hyperinsulinemia include obesity metabolic syndrome . PET scan measurement pancreas obtain compare people predict , basis biochemical testing , normal reduce , increase BCM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An important determinant progression diabetes beta cell mass ( BCM ) . Measurement plasma insulin use surrogate marker insulin level often correlate well beta cell mass development mean assess BCM would provide important endpoint . For example , highrisk individual could monitor prior onset diabetes patient could monitor prospectively determine progression disease response therapy . We previously identify specific marker beta cell call VMAT2 . We propose use radioligand , [ 11C ] DTBZ , bind VMAT2 positron emission tomography ( P.E.T . ) scan assess whether P.E.T . measure beta cell mass . This radioligand , [ 11C ] DTBZ , use previously human subject clinical trial evaluate P.E.T scan brain patient bipolar illness schizophrenia compare healthy control subject . We hypothesize P.E.T . [ 11C ] DTBZ differentiate normal , reduce increase beta cell mass human subject . Subjects predict normal beta cell mass recruit among normal weight nondiabetic people plasma insulin level within normal range . Subjects predict reduced beta cell mass recruit among patient Type 1 diabetes low measurable insulin level . Subjects predict increased beta cell mass recruit among obese nondiabetic patient hyperinsulinemia . Measurements [ 11C ] DTBZ uptake pancreas obtain compare study population .</detailed_description>
