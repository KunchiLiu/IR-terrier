	<brief_title>Tapentadol IR v Oxycodone IR v Placebo Acute Pain From Vertebral Compression Fracture Associated With Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , multicenter , double-blind ( neither patient physician know study drug administer ) study determine efficacy safety tapentadol immediate release ( IR ) compare placebo oxycodone IR approximately 625 patient acute pain cause vertebral compression fracture ( VCFs ) associate assumed osteoporosis treatment oral opioid analgesic appropriate . Patients randomize receive multiple dos tapentadol IR 50 75 milligram ( mg ) oxycodone IR 5 10 mg placebo 10 day . Screening/Randomization Visit ( Visit 1 ) : Potential patient acute thoracolumbar pain either new onset pain acute exacerbation previous pain associate VCF identify . The acute pain episode must start within 14 day Visit 1 . The study explain informed consent obtain . Patients either radiographic procedure confirm diagnosis VCF within 3 month prior Visit 1 radiographic procedure ( e.g. , lateral vertebral x-ray magnetic resonance imaging , etc ) perform Visit 1 standard care . Patients must moderate severe acute vertebral pain must appropriate candidate pain management oral opioid analgesic . At Visit 1 , patient must report qualify average back pain intensity score last 24 hour related current episode qualify current back pain intensity 11-point numerical rating scale ( NRS ) 0=no pain 10=pain bad imagine . Patients must also qualify score Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) eligible study participation . At Visit 1 , patient laboratory assessment ( include urine drug screen ) , physical back examination electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Patients also complete paper copy sleep quality , functionality vomit assessment ( i.e. , morning ( AM ) evening ( PM ) Interactive Voice Response [ IVR ] system question except satisfaction treatment ) . In addition , patient physical performance assess . Patients take long-acting controlled-release opioid therapy immediate release CII opioid formulation ( e.g. , Opana IR , Percocet , Percodan , oxycodone IR , Dilaudid ) within 1 month prior Visit 1 eligible study . Patients take CIII opioid formulation ( e.g. , Tylenol Codeine ) analgesic medication ( e.g. , Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) previously describe eligible study participation meet study criterion ( e.g. , pain intensity score ) , unless take CIII &gt; 5 days/week 1 month prior Visit 1 . After randomization analgesic medication study drug prohibit except NSAIDs take condition chronic back pain , provide patient take stable regimen least one month screening plan continue throughout study . Patients may take 2 pill ( form ) acetaminophen ( e.g. , Tylenol Extra-Strength ) pain back pain ( e.g. , headache , joint pain ) per day . Subjects take 325 mg/day aspirin cardiovascular prevention permit enter study provide stable dose least 1 month prior study entry plan continue dose study . Double-Blind Treatment : Patients may enrol randomized laboratory ECG result pending . If result test suggest patient good health , patient immediately discontinue study . Patients meet study entry criterion randomize double-blind fashion 2:2:1 ratio receive tapentadol IR , oxycodone IR , match placebo every 4-6 hour wake hour need pain . The first dose study drug one capsule tapentadol IR 50 mg , oxycodone IR 5 mg placebo . Most patient take first dose study drug office Visit 1 . All patient instruct call IVR system complete another assessment current back pain intensity immediately take first dose study drug . This call make patient study site unless first dose take office , case patient make call home . Patients instruct call IVR system every morning even complete assessment relate back pain intensity pain relief . Patients also respond IVR system question related sleep quality , patient satisfaction treatment functionality ( AM ) vomiting ( PM ) . Patients discontinue prematurely reason instruct contact study site complete final assessment , prior take supplemental pain medication applicable , schedule final study visit . During call , site personnel obtain current pain intensity pain relief score patient ; score document . Patients begin treatment Day 1 one `` low dose '' capsule study drug ( tapentadol IR 50 mg , oxycodone IR 5 mg , match placebo ) . For subsequent dos , patient may remain `` low dose '' capsule ( tapentadol IR 50 mg , oxycodone IR 5 mg , match placebo ) may choose take `` high dose '' ( tapentadol IR 75 mg , oxycodone IR 10 mg , match placebo ) every 4 6 hour wake hour need depend level pain tolerability study drug . The duration treatment study drug 10 day . Tapentadol IR 450 mg oxycodone IR 60 mg maximum daily dose allow . Patients require supplemental medication insufficient analgesia discontinue study treat investigator 's discretion . All patient receive telephone call study staff Day 3 . During telephone call , site personnel inquire patient 's overall status . Patients return study site Day 10/End Study final visit ( Visit 2 ) . Patients discontinue study prior final visit complete final assessment current pain intensity pain relief ( paper ) . In addition , patient physical functionality assess . Patients investigator complete global assessment study drug . The investigator also respond two ease-of-care question . Vital sign obtain , safety assessment complete study drug collect . All patient post-study analgesia prescribe investigator 's discretion . Tapentadol IR 50 75 mg , oxycodone IR 5 10 mg , placebo 10 day . The dose every 4-6 hour , need pain . Maximum dosage 450 mg tapentadol 60 mg oxycodone per day .</detailed_description>
