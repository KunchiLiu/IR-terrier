	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Androgen ablation therapy , bicalutamide , leuprolide , goserelin , may lessen amount androgen make body . Vaccine therapy may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know whether androgen ablation therapy effective without vaccine therapy treat patient prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study androgen ablation therapy see well work give together without vaccine therapy treat patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Androgen Ablation Therapy With Without Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine median PSA recurrence-free survival patient nonmetastatic , biochemically relapsed prostate cancer respond PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/mL administer brief ( 6-month ) course androgen ablation either alone combination GVAX prostate cancer vaccine ( CG1940/CG8711 ) immunotherapy . Secondary - To determine safety combine treatment androgen ablation CG1940/CG8711 immunotherapy patient . - To determine median time metastatic disease development patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord Gleason score ( &gt; 7 v ≤ 7 ) , PSA double time ( &lt; 3 month v 3-9 month v &gt; 9 month ) prior androgen ablation ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm 1 ( arm I ) :2 ( arm II ) ratio . - Arm I ( androgen-ablation therapy ) : Patients receive oral bicalutamide daily day 1-28 . Patients also receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist treatment comprise leuprolide acetate goserelin intramuscularly ( IM ) day 8 . Treatment LHRH agonist repeat every 12 week 24 week . - Arm II ( androgen-ablation therapy vaccine ) : Patients receive androgen ablation arm I . Patients also receive GVAX prostate cancer vaccine ( CG1940 CG8711 ) intradermally ( ID ) day 1 . Beginning day 1 week 3 , patient receive booster dos CG1940 CG8711 ID every 2 week 24 week . Patients evaluate day 1 week 25 ass disease . If PSA &gt; 0.5 ng/mL AND evidence metastatic disease image study , patient treat discretion investigator . If PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/mL , evidence metastatic disease , patient consider responder continue PSA evaluate every 4 week PSA relapse . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
