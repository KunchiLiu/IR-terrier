	<brief_summary>The goal study study role LEMG accurately predict recovery vocal function well study time change LEMG activity prior return function . We aim collaborate several active pediatric otolaryngological practice throughout country turn agree evaluate infant child vocal fold immobility fit standardize inclusion exclusion criterion mean standardized LEMG protocol one year period time . Our particular goal collect review information one year period time child evaluate vocal fold immobility mean LEMG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Laryngeal Electromyography ( LEMG ) Children With Vocal Fold Immobility : Longitudinal Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : Primary central hypothesis : Operative LEMG perform serial fashion predict return RLN function child iatrogenic injury . Secondary hypothesis : Operative LEMG perform serial fashion allow projection time RLN recovery Inclusion criterion : 1 . Children age 0-18 vocal fold immobility document laryngeal fiberoptic evaluation 2 . Children recent , identifiable cardiac surgical etiology RLN injury subsequent VFI 3 . Children whose parent sign inform consent sign assent old enough . Exclusion criteria 1 . Children whose family give informed consent give inform assent ( child old enough understand ) 2 . Children congenital VFI etiology clearly identify Data record : 1 . Age patient 2 . Gender 3 . Age initial fiberoptic evaluation initial diagnosis 4 . Diagnosis 5 . Serial Laryngeal Recordings 6 . Fiberoptic Evaluations LEMG Recording While light plane anesthesia , follow recording routinely perform : 1 . 10 second right leave vocal fold LEMG simultaneously record gain 50 V 2 . 10 second right leave vocal fold LEMG simultaneously record gain 200 V 3 . 10 second right vocal fold LEMG record gain 50 V 4 . 10 second right vocal fold LEMG record gain 200 V 5 . 10 second left vocal fold LEMG record gain 50 V 6 . 10 second left vocal fold LEMG record gain 200 V Total recording time : 60 second Timing LEMG Awake Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy Following current standard clinical evaluation perform MEEI , propose perform awake fiberoptic laryngoscopy operative LEMG follow time point : initially ( within 3 week injury possible ) , 3 month post-injury mark , 9- month post injury mark ( 3 recording total ; perform final fiberoptic laryngoscopy office one year time interval ) . The time point choose record necessitates operative procedure general anesthesia want limit number general anesthetic . We recognize risk limit number operative LEMG recording lose data-points chart recovery RLN function , felt risk multiple general anesthetic sufficient enough warrant limit number recording much possible .
