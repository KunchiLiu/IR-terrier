	<brief_summary>Patients present elective surgery require tracheal intubation randomize one two different ETT stylet . The primary outcome time intubation . The null hypothesis difference . The GlideScope video laryngoscope ( Verathon ) widely use intubating device use high-resolution camera embed plastic laryngoscope blade . An LED provide illumination . The GlideScope often provide good laryngoscopic view , pass endotracheal tube ( ETT ) vocal cord sometimes difficult . Because 60 degree anterior curvature GlideScope 's blade , ETT 's must stylets inserted ETT distal tip position anteriorly . Various author recommend different angle ETT optimally place trachea , include match GlideScope 's 60 degree angle , configure ETT 90 degree bend . Previous study demonstrate 90 degree sharp bend faster subjectively easier heterogeneous group intubators . With introduction Flex-It stylet Parker Medical , question arises best configuration stylet ETT . Therefore , prospective , randomize , single-blinded trial propose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Flex-It Stylet Malleable Stylet GlideScope Intubation : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Written inform consent obtain one study investigator , copy give participant . Written inform consent also obtain operator GlideScope . Envelopes computer-generated randomize group assignment present site . The envelope consecutively number ( i.e . `` U1 '' , `` U2 '' University Hospital , `` S1 '' , `` S2 '' St Joseph 's Health Care , etc. ) . After consent , randomization occur select next consecutive envelope . The envelope contain data collection form well piece paper follow information : - top randomization group ( A , B ) text description endotracheal tube angle stylet ( i.e . `` 90 degree - malleable stylet '' ) - body piece paper template show exact shape tube must bend , include distal proximal end , angle curvature must follow , location along length tube create angle . The angle location male female . There three distinct anesthesia provider involve conduct study , follow : 1 . `` operator '' - person perform intubation 2 . `` timer '' - person time outcome ( one co-investigators ) 3 . `` shaper '' - person ensure angle stylet tube match group patient allocate Because person intubate must blind time tube use , unopened envelope take third anesthesia provider , prepare ETT stylet area visible person perform intubation person time intubation . The person perform intubation specify size tube prepare . This commonly 7.5 mm internal diameter ( ID ) female 8.0 ID male , operator free use whatever size feel appropriate . The tube size selection take place unblinding group allocation affect decision tube size . The tubes cut 27 cm marking . `` Group A '' ETT 's shape aid standard malleable stylet ( Rusch 14 Fr ) lubricate single-use water-soluble lubricant . `` Group B '' ETT 's instrumented Flex-It Stylet , identical lubricant . The prepared tube conceal standard green OR towel bring operating room ( OR ) . This tube place close patient 's head readily accessible . Data Collection In OR , GlideScope turn least 60 second use lens warm-up prevent fogging . The patient care usual fashion respect monitor induction general anesthesia . To ensure adequate pre-oxygenation , patient 's end-tidal oxygen must ≥ 70 % . Muscle relaxation use , agent use discretion operator . After induction anesthesia , bag-mask ventilation use usual fashion operator decides proceed laryngoscopy GlideScope . The operator remain blind group allocation laryngoscopic view obtain GlideScope , upon hand endotracheal tube . The timer ( see tube green towel ) watch operator GlideScope insert patient 's mouth , start timer , turn 180º face anesthetic monitor . The timer able see ETT , stylet , curvature face monitor screen . Timing continue end-tidal CO2 least 30 mmHg see anesthesia monitor , point data collection form fill , study protocol finish . ( The time intubation record near tenth second . ) If operator fail intubate within 3 attempt 150 second , intubation note failure , ultimately successful mean secure airway record . The definition `` attempt '' purpose clinical trial follow : 1. anytime GlideScope blade remove patient mouth re-inserted 2. anytime endotracheal tube re-shaped ( regardless whether GlideScope actually remove patient 's mouth 3. substantial adjustment make patient 's position ( head position , neck flexion , neck extension ) . Small movement would occur normal process intubation would count `` substantial '' . If oxygen desaturation ( record pulse oximetry ) 95 % occurs , patient ventilate usual fashion ensure oxygenation , re-attempting intubation use GlideScope may proceed , time continue , limit successful intubation ( within 3 attempt total 150s ) apply . Between attempt , tube may re-shaped operator operator feel another curvature would prefer .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . * Any adult patient schedule elective surgery . 2 . ETT indicate procedure opinion attend anesthesiologist . 3 . Any operator perform ≥ 10 GlideScope intubation . 1 . Any patient use GlideScope contraindicate opinion attend anesthesiologist . 2 . * Patient know cervical spine abnormality . 3 . * Any patient know probable difficult airway ( rare occurrence unlikely evenly distribute group could skew data ) . 4 . Any patient requiring rapid sequence induction .</criteria>
