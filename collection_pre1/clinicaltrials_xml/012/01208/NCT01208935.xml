	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Efficacy Nicotine Patch Gum Treatment Adolescent Tobacco Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize two nicotine replacement delivery system ( patch gum ) safe efficacious treatment adolescent nicotine dependence . Consequently , use patch gum tolerable population minor adverse side-effects . Secondly , individual group ( patch , gum ) may benefit either cessation reduction smoke exposure , result distinctly different mechanism two treatment ( steady state vs. intermittent delivery NRT ) . A.The primary objective study : 1. evaluate comparative safety nicotine transdermal system ( 21 mg `` patch '' ) nicotine gum ( 2 mg 4 mg ) , dose appropriately pre-treatment level smoking , initiate sustain smoke cessation reduction ; 2. compare compliance level patch gum ; 3. evaluate comparative efficacy patch gum initiate sustain smoke cessation reduction ; 4. compare rate biochemically-verified continuous abstinence use intent-to-treat analysis base individual subject outcome . B.The secondary objective study : 1. correlate pre-treatment nicotine exposure ( saliva cotinine ) withdrawal intensity measure group treatment treatment outcome ; 2. compare biological marker smoke exposure ( expire air CO saliva thiocyanate ) self-reports smoke correlate withdrawal symptomatology treatment outcome ; 3. obtain smoking topography data ( puff volume , velocity intake , interpuff interval , puff per cigarette ) adolescent pattern smoke index smoking intensity exposure correlate pre-treatment smoking intensity treatment outcome . C.The tertiary objective : 1. examine validity use biochemical marker smoke exposure ( expire air CO saliva thiocyanate ) potential marker smoke cessation adolescent ; 2. compare relative cotinine exposure adolescent smoke receive nicotine replacement successfully quit</detailed_description>
