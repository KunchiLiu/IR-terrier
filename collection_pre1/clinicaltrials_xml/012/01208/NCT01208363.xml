	<brief_summary>Rationale : Iron deficiency zinc deficiency , public health significance sub-Saharan Africa . An estimated 50 % child ( 5-14 year ) develop country suffer anaemia , half estimate iron deficiency anaemia . Interventions design implemented year towards solve hunger anaemia especially among school age child . One intervention School Feeding Programme ( SFP ) common develop industrialized country . SFP part Ghanaian educational system well 40 year , albeit small scale . The main stay programme make distinguishable past exist school feed programme reliance locally produce available food , cowpea . Legume staple like cowpea identify important source protein non-heme iron rural population develop country like Ghana . The problem however low bioavailability micronutrient legumes . Objective : To assess efficacy iron fortify cowpea base meal ( Tubani ) improve iron status primary school child rural northern Ghana Study design : A randomized double blind parallel design conduct . One group receive iron fortify Tubani NaFeEDTA group receive unfortified Tubani . Study population : Two hundred forty apparently healthy pupil low primary school participate . The participating school school feed programme currently operation . Intervention ( applicable ) : Children feed Tubani contain 10mg fortification iron ( form NaFeEDTA ) three time week six month . Weight , height blood sample measure baseline six month intervention . Participants treat intestinal parasite start intervention halfway intervention . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study endpoint iron-deficiency anaemia ( IDA ) . IDA define concurrent anaemia iron deficiency . Whole blood collect analysis Hb , serum ferritin ( SF ) , serum transfer receptor ( sTfR ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . Anemia define hemoglobin concentration &lt; 115 g/L , iron deficiency define SF concentration &lt; 12 Âµg/L . Venipunctures occasionally lead bruise small local inflammation usually disappear within one week . To minimize risk , blood collection perform trained experienced phlebotomist . Written inform consent obtain subject .</brief_summary>
