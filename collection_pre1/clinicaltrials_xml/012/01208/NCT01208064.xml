	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether pazopanib hydrochloride effective placebo treat patient non-small cell lung cancer progress first-line chemotherapy . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II/III trial study well give pazopanib hydrochloride work compare give placebo treat patient non-small cell lung cancer receive first-line chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Placebo Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Received First-Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare therapeutic benefit , term overall survival , maintenance pazopanib hydrochloride patient non-small cell lung cancer progress first-line chemotherapy . Secondary - To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall specific time point ( 6 12 month ) . - To document toxicity profile pazopanib hydrochloride accord CTCAE v 4 . - To assess use C-reactive protein ( CRP ) detection progression disease maintenance phase therapy . - To compare quality-of-life patient maintenance therapy . - To compare discontinuation rate/treatment compliance patient treat regimen . - To collect health economics data resource utilization document EQ-5D generic QoL instrument . Tertiary ( correlative ) - To evaluate effect germline genetic variation drug response ( pharmacogenetics ) use PAX gene . - To find relevant biomarkers VEGFR pathways plasma sample . - To obtain pharmacokinetics pazopanib hydrochloride 600 800 mg. - To evaluate biomarkers tumor tissue . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize study . Patients stratify accord center , histology ( squamous vs nonsquamous ) , performance status ( 0-1 v 2 15 % patient ) , response initial chemotherapy ( complete response/partial response v stable disease ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral placebo daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete quality-of life-questionnaires ( QLQ-C30 QLQ-LC13 ) baseline , 6 week , 14 week , 22 week . Health economics data resource utilization collect documented use EQ-5D questionnaire . Blood sample may collect periodically pharmacokinetics pharmacogenetic study . Samples analyze germline genetic variation drug response , relevant biomarkers VEGFR pathway , concentration pazopanib hydrochloride . Previously collect tumor tissue analyze biomarkers . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
