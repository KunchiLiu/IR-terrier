	<brief_title>Phase 1 Follow-on Study AAV2-hRPE65v2 Vector Subjects With Leber Congenital Amaurosis ( LCA ) 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study follow-on Phase 1 dose-escalation safety study ( closed enrollment June 2009 ) . Up twelve adult child molecular diagnosis LCA2 , participate early Phase 1 study , meet study eligibility criterion , receive AAV2-hRPE65v2 vector previously uninjected , contralateral eye evaluate safety bilateral , sequential subretinal administration AAV2-hRPE65v2 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Prior participation Phase 1 study unilateral , subretinal administration AAV2hRPE65v2 . Visual acuity equal great light perception . Sufficient viable retinal cell contralateral , previously uninjected eye , determine noninvasive mean , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) and/or ophthalmoscopy . Must either : 1 ) area retina within posterior pole &gt; 100 µm show OCT ; 2 ) ≥ 3 disc area retina without atrophy pigmentary degeneration within posterior pole ; 3 ) remain visual field within 50 degree fixation . Willingness adhere protocol longterm followup evidence write informed consent parental permission subject assent ( applicable ) . Unable unwilling meet requirement study . Participation study investigational drug within past six month . Use retinoid compound precursor could potentially interact biochemical activity RPE65 enzyme ; individual discontinue use compound 18 month may become eligible . Prior intraocular surgery within six month . Known sensitivity medication plan use perioperative period . Preexisting eye condition , glaucoma , complicate systemic disease would preclude plan surgery could interfere interpretation study . Complicating systemic disease would include disease , treatment disease , alter ocular function . Examples malignancy whose treatment could affect central nervous system function ( example : radiation treatment orbit ; leukemia CNS/optic nerve involvement ) . Subjects diabetes sickle cell disease would exclude manifestation advance retinopathy ( e.g . macular edema proliferative change ) . Also exclude would subject immunodeficiency ( acquire congenital ) could susceptibility opportunistic infection ( CMV retinitis ) . Individuals childbearing potential pregnant unwilling use effective contraception four month follow vector administration . Any condition would allow potential subject complete followup examination course study , opinion investigator , make potential subject unsuitable study . Subjects NOT exclude base gender , race , ethnicity .</criteria>
