	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Maintenance Therapy With Immunomodulator MGN1703 Patients With Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase 2 study conduct patient advanced colorectal carcinoma disease control first-line standard chemotherapy regimens oral intravenous fluoropyrimidines/leucovorin irinotecan oxaliplatin combine standard dose bevacizumab last 4.5 6 month , whereas treatment duration irinotecan oxaliplatin le 3 month . Studies confirm completely chemotherapy-free interval applicable patient advance colorectal carcinoma achieve disease control initial first-line chemotherapy . Those therapy holiday minimize toxicity unnecessary treatment load , reduce intensity treatment , allow patient stay longer therapy , prevent therapy discontinuation due toxicity , preserve ability re-administer chemotherapy later , increase quality life patient . The therapy-free interval represent possibility evaluate efficacy study drug , MGN1703 .</detailed_description>
