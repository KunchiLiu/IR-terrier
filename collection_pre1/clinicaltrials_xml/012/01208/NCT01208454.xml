	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together isotretinoin see well work treat patient high-risk refractory recurrent neuroblastoma . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Isotretinoin may help vorinostat work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Giving vorinostat together isotretinoin may effective treatment neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat Isotretinoin Treating Patients With High-Risk Refractory Recurrent Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) vorinostat pediatric suspension administer daily 4 time per week orally two week , combination twice daily 13-cis-retinoic acid ( [ cisRA ] , isotretinoin ) orally 14 day child refractory recurrent neuroblastoma . II . To define toxicity vorinostat administer combination cisRA . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetics vorinostat give pediatric suspension . II . To describe relationship vorinostat pharmacokinetics occurrence systemic toxicity . III . To determine pharmacokinetics cisRA give combination vorinostat . IV . To describe histone acetylation level peripheral blood mononuclear cell different dos vorinostat . V. To describe , within context Phase I study , response rate vorinostat combine cisRA patient recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma . VI . To describe toxicity response rate vorinostat determine maximal tolerate dose combine cisRA patient age 22-30 year age study entry recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study vorinostat . Patients receive isotretinoin orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 , PO suspension* vorinostat daily ( QD ) day 1-4 course 1 , capsule vorinostat PO QD day 1-4 8-11 course 2 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . EXPANSION COHORT 1 ( = &lt; 21 year age ) : Once maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) determine , patient treat dose level . EXPANSION COHORT 2 ( 22-30 year age ) : Patients receive isotretinoin vorinostat MTD day 1-3 8-10 . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically . NOTE : *Patients le 10 year age encourage continue use oral suspension beyond course 1 .</detailed_description>
