	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose cediranib maleate give together without lenalidomide see well work treat patient thyroid cancer . Cediranib maleate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Lenalidomide may stop growth thyroid cancer block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether cediranib maleate effective give together lenalidomide treat thyroid cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate With Without Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) cediranib ( cediranib maleate ) plus lenalidomide . ( Phase I ) II . Determine progression-free survival rate single agent cediranib patient iodine refractory , unresectable differentiate thyroid cancer ( DTC ) evidence disease progression within 12 month study enrollment . ( Phase II ) III . Determine progression-free survival rate cediranib combination lenalidomide patient iodine refractory , unresectable DTC evidence disease progression within 12 month study enrollment . ( Phase II ) IV . Compare progression-free survival curve single agent cediranib combination therapy cediranib lenalidomide . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate cediranib combination lenalidomide patient iodine refractory , unresectable DTC evidence disease progression within 12 month study enrollment . ( Phase I ) II . Determine toxicity , duration response , progression free survival , overall survival patient DTC treat cediranib plus lenalidomide . ( Phase I ) III . Determine response rate duration response , early tumor size change , toxicity , overall survival patient DTC treat cediranib cediranib plus lenalidomide . ( Phase II ) IV . Determine whether presence v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 ( B-RAF ) V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma ( K-RAS ) mutation patient DTC predict response cediranib cediranib plus lenalidomide . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Phase I : Patients receive cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Phase II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive cediranib maleate PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive cediranib maleate PO lenalidomide PO Phase I . NOTE : As April 10 , 2015 , patient assign arm discontinue lenalidomide may continue cediranib alone . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
