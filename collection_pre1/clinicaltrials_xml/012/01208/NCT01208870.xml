	<detailed_description>Habituation one factor may relate excess energy intake . Research show rate habituation inversely related amount food consume slow habituation may factor relevant obesity , overweight youth adult habituate slow consume energy peer . Habituation basic form learn observe many response system . We believe habituation important process mediates food regulation meal across meal . However , research child translate basic research habituation food clinical intervention pediatric obesity . In first phase , implement series laboratory study assess effect stimulus specificity variety simultaneous reduction variety high energy density food short ( within meal ) long-term ( across meal ) habituation . The second phase design implement series field study extend basic research first phase well define optimal interval reduce variety facilitate long-term habituation high energy density food natural environment . The third phase design develop pilot test family-based behavioral intervention child incorporate finding phase2 clinical intervention .</detailed_description>
