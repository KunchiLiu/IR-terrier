	<brief_summary>The main objective study determine effectiveness new treatment regime use electrical stimulation improvement hand function person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . This treatment show useful stroke patient , preliminary work indicates may also case SCI patient . Our approach functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) represent departure establish FES approach , involve develop assistive device permanent , everyday use . Instead , use FES therapeutic intervention help individual quadriplegia recover voluntary grasping function . Investigators believe subject undergo FES therapy able grasp object without stimulation treatment program complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FES Therapy : Restoring Voluntary Grasping Function Chronic SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective present prospective randomize control trial investigate FES therapy would generate similar level improvement hand function chronic C4 C7 incomplete complete SCI individual compare conventional occupational therapy . For purpose study individual chronic SCI sustain injury least 24 month prior enrol study . The FES conventional occupational therapy administer thrice-weekly 13 week ( i.e. , 39 session total ) 60 individual SCI . Half participant receive FES therapy half receive conventional occupational therapy equal intensity . The secondary objective evaluate improvement hand function improve participant ' activity daily live skill satisfaction life . Background Significance The sudden onset traumatic SCI result severe impairment motor and/or sensory function body limb . A significant part expense incur SCI associate need many individual SCI caregiver assist various daily task eat , groom ambulation . This dependence , besides financially strenuous patient family , frequently precipitate psychological problem depression , social withdrawal inactivity.For person quadriplegia , hand function essential achieve high level independence activity daily live . In recent survey , reveal majority people quadriplegia rate recovery hand function high priority.FES one promising approach towards improve grasp function SCI individual permanent hand impairment . A neuroprosthesis grasp device improve restore grasping , hold , release function person SCI [ 1 ] . The neuroprosthesis apply FES artificially generate muscle contraction apply short current pulse motor nerve innervate muscle . FES applied individual SCI help restore function walk grasp contract group paralyze muscle orchestrate manner.Despite usefulness neuroprostheses improve functionality , SCI consumer , therapist psychiatrist remain hesitant use technology . For instance , Popovic et al . ( principal investigator ) report consumer retain dexterity without FES-assisted system hesitate use surface FES device manipulate small object , even though gain significant improvement function wearing . Also , neuroprostheses Freehand system require invasive procedure implementation , often unappealing SCI consumer . These issue FES , along mindset impairment functionality permanent , led design system SCI consumer little interest use long period time . Our application neuroprosthesis grasp proposal present departure standard establish approach FES application . The Compex Motion neuroprosthesis , develop Drs . Popovic ( principal investigator ) Keller1 , flexible device design improve grasp function SCI stroke patient . This multi-channel surface stimulation system grasp provide palmar lateral grasp , hold number advantage exist neuroprostheses.Firstly , whereas system design used exclusively permanent orthotic system SCI consumer order allow grasp , Compex Motion design help retrain voluntary grasping function . Hence , device meant use part rehabilitation process towards improve functionality oppose merely substitute . Secondly , Compex Motion surface FES system require implanted system possess feature limit flexibility . These feature make suitable option rehabilitation application , typically require portable , flexible , non-invasive , multi-channel FES system . Thirdly , although Compex Motion , Handmaster , Belgrade Grasping-Reaching System use retrain voluntary grasping function individual stroke , Compex Motion use purpose individual SCI . The advantage Compex Motion system FES system potential retrain function SCI patient fact system 's application require long-term support/commitment clinical engineering specialist . Recent innovative advance FES application , spearhead team , clearly indicate short-term , therapeutic intervention neuroprosthesis grasp enhance voluntary function individual SCI . These study also suggest novel method apply FES augment functional improvement potential improve overall physical psychological well person SCI .</detailed_description>
