	<brief_summary>The purpose study use functional MRI ( fMRI ) magnetic resonance ( MR ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) investigate brain activation white matter change patient congenital ( birth defect spinal column ) , acute chronic complete spinal cord lesion . The finding study may provide basis well understand pathomechanisms underlie dynamic neurofunctional change follow spinal cord lesion man . This understanding important improvement exist therapy development new therapeutic approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Function White Matter Changes Congenital , Acute Chronic Spinal Cord Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently new approach spinal cord repair successfully establish animal model . Promising therapy promote spinal axonal regeneration man available near future . Most research field focus lesion perilesional spinal cord . The recovery motor sensory function , however , permit local process spinal level . The whole central nervous system ( CNS ) react condition . Therefore modulation motor sensory function spinal cord lesioned patient reflect characteristic change cortical brain activity , accessible new non-invasive functional neuroimaging technique functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Changes white matter due axonal damage also measure qualitatively quantitatively use MR diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . Those measure may provide basis well understand pathophysiology underlie spinal cord lesion man , include change brain function time ( rehabilitation ) relate specific treatment . However , study available yet address topic provide mechanism-based approach determine time interval application novel neuroregenerative drug . By investigation brain activation white matter change patient congenital ( myelomeningocele ( MMC ) ) , acute chronic spinal cord lesion ( ASIA A ) first fundamental work field conduct study .</detailed_description>
