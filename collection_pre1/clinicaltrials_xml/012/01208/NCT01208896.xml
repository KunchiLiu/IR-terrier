	<brief_title>Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation After Reduced-intensity Conditioning Relapsed Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Follicular lymphomas chemosensitive neoplasm characterize relentless succession remission relapse treated conventional chemotherapy . The successive period remission short duration patient invariably die disease . At first line , patient treat conventional chemotherapy . At first relapse , intensive chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) often propose . Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC-allo ) option patient relapse autologous SCT , allow long-term progression free survival 50 60 % . The toxic mortality relate severe acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) remain critical issue . The goal study test multicentric approach strategy RIC-allo include rituximab order reduce incidence acute GVHD . Around half patient relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma treat allogeneic SCT achieve long-term progression free survival whatever condition regimen . Because median age patient follicular lymphoma 55 year , reduce intensity conditioning appropriate option setting . The outcome patient chemoresistant disease usually poor high toxic mortality . As consequence , patient chemosensitive disease include study . To reduce toxic mortality , critical reduce incidence severe acute GVHD . A low incidence acute GVHD could obtain use Rituximab transplantation report MD Anderson 's experience several hematological malignancy include follicular lymphoma . Their result impressive patient follicular lymphoma long-term survival 85 % . The favored hypothesis depletion patient donor B cell reduce presentation minor histocompatibility alloantigens . The benefit Rituximab could also explain anti-lymphoma effect could compensate putative reduction graft versus lymphoma effect due good control GVHD . The primary objective estimate 2-year overall survival setting .</detailed_description>
