	<brief_summary>The present study aim combine biochemical method various type image technique identify pathophysiology Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The main interest find marker associate early step pathology disease . The investigator shall thus screen ) molecule cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) plasma specific AD , ii ) brain image marker ( e.g . MRI PET ) correlate detailed clinical assessment . Biomarkers interest would useful : 1 . Enable accurate detection disease early . Such biomarkers need specifically reflect early pathophysiology AD distinguish disorder similar symptomatology , type dementia major depression . The sensitivity specificity biomarkers combination clinical assessment least 90 % . 2 . Enable prediction course event disease , disease rate individual patient . Biomarkers predict pattern future symptom extremely valuable . 3 . Allow monitor early effect new disease-modifying therapy ( so-called surrogate biomarkers ) . Currently clinical therapeutic trial AD require large patient group together long-term treatment . Both size group treatment time reduce help surrogate biomarkers . 4 . Study pathogenesis disease . Biomarkers use investigate detail early alteration AD patient . For instance , change level certain molecule CSF together genetic predisposition could correlate clinical sign change detectable brain imaging . This lead identification new therapeutic target could easily monitor future trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Baseline investigation patient mild cognitive deficit We conduct prospective , longitudinal study consecutively include patient mild cognitive deficit ( MCI ) , seek medical care Neuropsychiatric Clinic ( Malmö , Sweden ) Unit Cognitive Medicine ( Lund , Sweden ) . At baseline MCI patient undergo detailed neurological psychiatric examination , include assessment depressive symptom ADL-capacity well cognitive motor test . Patients also genotyped APOE . Samples plasma , blood ( DNA mRNA ) CSF also collect . All patient undergo advanced MRI scan brain . A subset undergo 18F-Flutemetamol PET . We include patient period three year . 1.2 Follow-up MCI patient Thereafter , follow patient least 4 maximum 6 year repeat test clinical evaluation . During clinical follow-up estimate many patient develop type dementia , instance AD . Moreover also estimate aggressive progression disease patient develop AD help repeat cognitive testing . 2 . Baseline investigation healthy elderly volunteer To answer question new biomarkers could detect early sign AD healthy people , include 200 elderly volunteer subject . These people recruit population-based study Malmö ( `` Malmö Kost Cancer '' ) people without memory problem cognitive difficulty , performs well cognitive test , offer participate . These individual undergo baseline study MCI patient ( see ) , include cognitive test , psychiatric assessment , lumbar puncture , blood test MRI scan . A subset also examine 18F-Flutemetamol PET . 2.1 Follow-up elderly volunteer This population also followed-up 4-6 year repeat cognitive test determine subject develop cognitive impairment ( e.g . memory problem ) period time . 3 . Analyses CSF plasma/blood CSF plasma/blood sample do baseline , 2 4 year follow-up . To find novel good biomarkers predict AD healthy MCI patient , CSF , plasma blood analyze various biomedical technique . We also screen biomarkers help u predict fast disease progress . We use two different approach , namely : ) analysis various candidate biomarkers b ) unbiased screen use proteomics . 4 . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) MRI do baseline , 2 4 year follow-up , use MRI scanner . We evaluate potential benefit new MRI protocols prediction future AD . MRI also use study pathogenesis AD . These new approach include : 3D-MP RAGE , T2* GRE , DTI/DTT , ASL MRS .</detailed_description>
