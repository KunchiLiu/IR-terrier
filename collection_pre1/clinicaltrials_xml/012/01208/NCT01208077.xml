	<brief_summary>This multinational registry ( 3 USA , 2 European center ) capture ED continuous non invasive hemodynamic monitoring ( use Nexfin finger cuff technology ) patient present acute heart failure , stroke syndrome systemic infection . Patients observe Emergency Department ( ED ) disposition determine clinical outcome ( length stay hospital , development organ dysfunction , mortality need unscheduled medical care within ensue 30 day ) . It anticipate specific ED hemodynamic profile predictive well clinical outcome others . This information provide outcome data need design future therapeutic trial evaluate effect ED hemodynamic manipulation overall patient management outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The PREMIUM Registry multinational , prospective , observational convenience study ED hemodynamic profile patient present acute CHF , stroke systemic infection potential relationship patient outcome . Continuous hemodynamics measure noninvasive mean use Nexfin device outcome ( hospital length stay , interval development organ dysfunction mortality need unscheduled medical care within ensue 30 day ) capture within registry . The treat ED physician blind hemodynamic monitoring modification standard care patient receives . Hospital chart review patients/family member additionally call 30 day hospital visit order collect additional outcome data .</detailed_description>
