	<brief_summary>The study WP4 EU-funded ( 7th FW ) project SATURN ( Impact Specific Antibiotic Therapies prevalence hUman host ResistaNt bacteria ) . A total 6 surgical 6 medical ward participate study . Sites study locate 3 country ( Italy , Serbia , Romania ) . This WP compare nosocomial acquisition rate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) -producing gram-negative bacteria ( E.coli , Klebsiella spp . Proteus spp . ) among different treatment group define temporal relationship start antibiotic therapy , acquisition new colonisation patient previously colonise , development bacterial infection cause strain isolated screen sample . This goal achieve complete follow primary objective : - To determine rate acquisition target antibiotic-resistant bacteria 1,000 antibiotic-days accord different class antibiotic , duration therapy antibiotic combination ( monotherapy versus combination therapy ) ; - To determine genotypic relation colonise infect strain patient patient ' hospital staff colonise strain ( perform collaboration WP1 SATURN project ) ; - To study virulence fitness isolates ( i.e . new colonise strain ) cause subsequent nosocomial infection ( perform collaboration WP1 SATURN project ) ; - To predict risk nosocomial infection due target bacteria single treatment therapy adjust length hospitalisation ward colonisation pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nasal sample detection MRSA rectal sample ( stoma sample case colostomy ) ESBL produce gram negative bacteria obtain hospital admission discharge . Patients start antibiotic therapy per o and/or intravenously sample antibiotic start ( t0 , within one hour ) follow interval : day 3 ( t1 ) , 7 ( t2 ) , 15 ( t3 ) , 30 ( t4 ) . Patients colonize MRSA and/or ESBL-producing gram negative bacteria start antibiotic therapy ( t0 sample ) exclude follow-up culture analysis . All patient include study follow determine whether develop clinical infection target ARB . Patients follow hospitalization afterwards total 30-day inclusion study . Screening performed outpatient clinic patient ' discharge hospital within 30 day start antibiotic ( t0 sample ) . Nasal rectal culture also obtain ward staff begin end study . This group include nurse staff include doctor contact patient . These culture handle manner patient ' culture</detailed_description>
