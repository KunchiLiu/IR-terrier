	<brief_summary>The main purpose 2-year lifestyle experiment waist loss twofold : 1. compare whole grain grain part healthy diet , 2. determine 8-week exercise program , lead physiotherapist , efficient brief counsel follow-up . People abdominal overweight ( ≥84 cm woman ≥98 cm men ) least one additional cardiovascular risk factor , ( typically hypertension , diabetes type 2 prior cardiovascular disease ) randomly assign receive Diet A Diet B , without structured exercise program department physiotherapy , control group receive usual care . Diet A B include fruit , vegetable , fish , meat , low-fat dairy product , differ Diet A recommend exchange cereal grain potato , root vegetable , fruit carbohydrate-rich food , Diet B recommend exchange regular cereal grain whole grain . The primary outcome ( important follow-up variable ) change waist circumference 2 year . Secondary outcome measure include blood pressure , blood lipid , level physical activity , subject diabetes , glycated hemoglobin fast blood sugar .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Grain Exercise Trial - Whole Grain Versus Grain With Without Physiotherapy-promoted Exercise Waist Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial 5 parallel group approximately equal size . Two hundred subject increase waist circumference ( ≥84 cm woman ≥98 cm men ) least one additional cardiovascular risk factor include . Four 5 group receive dietary advice ( A B ) 2 allocate physiotherapy . A fifth control group receive usual care addition follow-up . Randomization perform use internet-based random number generator School Computer Science Statistics , Trinity College , Dublin ( www.random.org ) . randomly assign receive Diet A Diet B , without structured exercise program department physiotherapy , control group receive usual care . In addition primary ( waist loss ) secondary outcome measure give , health questionnaire perform baseline 12 24 month question general health , self-reported quality life , medication use , live habit , physical activity , nutrition , tobacco , alcohol , personal motivation perceive ability change lifestyle . Furthermore , serum creatinine measure baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 24 month . There randomize control trial compare effect different lifestyle intervention physical activity level weight loss overweight people high risk cardiovascular disease . There study possible effect structure exercise program group train lead physiotherapist , exception rehabilitation program myocardial infarction . In addition , possible unique effect cereal grain satiety energy intake address randomize control trial . In two early study glucose intolerance diabetes type 2 , apply dietary model ( Paleolithic diet ) base root vegetable , fruit , vegetable , meat fish , partly expense cereal grain ( Lindeberg et al. , 2007 ; Jönsson et al. , 2009 ) . The result show beneficial effect waist circumference traditional dietary advice . In one study 29 overweight men coronary heart disease impair glucose tolerance , decrease waist circumference 2.7 cm great ( p=0,03 ) intervention group ( -5.6 cm ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -7.2 ; -3.9 ) control group ( -2.9 , CI -4.8 ; -1.1 ) 3 month follow-up ( Lindeberg et al. , 2007 ) . In second study , dietary model apply cross-over design among 13 subject diabetes type 2 , waist circumference decrease 4 cm ( p=0,02 ) intervention diet control diet ( Jönsson et al. , 2009 ) . There evidence suggest cereal grain may interfere leptin receptor activity way could hypothetically suppress satiety ( Jönsson et al. , 2005 ; Kamikubo et al. , 2008 ) .</detailed_description>
