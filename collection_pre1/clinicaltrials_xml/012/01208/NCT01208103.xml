	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Capecitabine Oxaliplatin Advanced Adenocarcinoma Small Bowel Ampulla Vater</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Oxaliplatin design block new cancer cell grow . Bevacizumab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block growth blood vessel . Capecitabine design interfere growth cancer cell . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive study drug 21-day `` study cycle . '' To receive oxaliplatin , central venous catheter ( CVC ) place . A CVC sterile , flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . You receive oxaliplatin CVC 2 hour Day 1 cycle , bevacizumab . You receive bevacizumab needle vein Day 1 cycle . The first time receive bevacizumab , give 90 minute . If infusion-related side effect bevacizumab , bevacizumab dos give 30-60 minute . You take capecitabine mouth 2 time day Days 1-14 cycle . Capecitabine tablets take 12 hour apart , within 30 minute eat meal cup ( 8 ounce ) water . If miss dose , try make dose double next dose . Study Visits : There study visit Cycle 1 . Up 3 day Day 1 Cycles Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight , nerve function , blood pressure . - You ask drug may take . - You ask symptom side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . At end Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , : - You CT MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - Urine collect check kidney function . Based result urine test , may ask collect urine 24 hour test kidney function . You give container collect urine . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect , study stop . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 10 day stop take study drug , end-of-treatment visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight , nerve function , blood pressure . - You ask drug may take . - You ask symptom side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You CT MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Follow-Up : The study staff ask symptom side effect may 30 day last dose study drug . The study staff may contact phone time routine clinic visit . If study staff contact phone , phone call last 15-30 minute . The study staff also review medical record and/or contact check status disease every 3 month stop receive study drug . If contact phone , phone call take 5 minute . If leave study reason disease get bad , CT MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease every 12 week unless start receive treatment disease get bad . Stopping Study Participation : You decide leave study time . It important tell study doctor think stop side effects/risks treatment check doctor . Another reason tell doctor think stop discuss follow-up care test could helpful . This investigational study . Bevacizumab , oxaliplatin , capecitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment type cancer , include colon rectal cancer . They FDA approve treatment small bowel ampulla Vater cancer . The use combination oxaliplatin , capecitabine , bevacizumab patient cancer small bowel ampulla Vater investigational . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm adenocarcinoma small bowel ampulla Vater . 2 . Prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( include 5FU , capecitabine , oxaliplatin ) treatment adenocarcinoma small bowel ampulla Vater allow complete &gt; /= 52 week prior first dose study treatment . 3 . Prior capecitabine 5FU administer radiosensitizing agent concurrently external beam radiotherapy allow . 4 . Patients must metastatic disease 5 . A minimum 4 week must elapse completion prior chemotherapy radiotherapy surgery start date study therapy . 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 2 . 7 . Adequate organ function include : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1,500/ul ; platelet &gt; /= 100,000/ul ; total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) * ; AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3 x ULN ; calculate creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) &gt; 50 cc/min ( calculate use Cockcroft Gault formula ) . *In patient know Gilbert 's syndrome direct bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 x ULN use organ function criterion , instead total bilirubin . 8 . Negative serum urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential ( define postmenopausal 12 month previous surgical sterilization ) , within one week prior initiation treatment . 9 . Patients must sign Informed Consent Authorization indicate aware investigational nature study know risk involve . 10 . The effect combination CAPOX bevacizumab develop fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry , duration study participation , six month follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant participate study , inform treat physician immediately . 11 . ( continued # 8 ) . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother oxaliplatin capecitabine bevacizumab , breast feeding must discontinue . 1 . Patients receive prior chemotherapy metastatic disease exclude . Chemotherapy give radiationsensitizer allow . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent receive investigational drug 28 day prior enrollment . 3 . Known history dihydropyrimidine ( DPD ) deficiency . 4 .
