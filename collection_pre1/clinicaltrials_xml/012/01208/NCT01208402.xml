	<brief_summary>The purpose study find Esmolol safe effective alternative treatment compare standard treatment use long act beta blocker drug , control abnormal heart rate , immediately surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esmolol Treatment Perioperative Tachycardia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The benefit versus risk perioperative beta blockade therapy adverse ischemic event risk reduction high risk patient undergo non-cardiac surgery recently challenge . In particular PeriOperative Ischemia Study Evaluation ( POISE trial ) show cardio-protective effect expense high incidence stroke all-cause mortality . In study death stroke significantly associate increase hypotension bradycardia . Long act agent - aggressively administer achieve heart rate ( HR ) control - appear associate significant adverse outcome ( death , stroke ) despite myocardial ischemia infarction reduction . It estimate 20 percent high risk patient come surgery chronic beta blocker oral therapy . The American Heart Association recommend continuation beta blocker situation beta-blocker withdrawal associate increased rate perioperative myocardial infarction . Protocols optimize perioperative administration beta-blockers high-risk patient therefore need . Esmolol cardioselective beta-blocker short elimination half-life ( t1/2 = 9.2 min ) intrinsic sympathomimetic activity . Evidence reveal Esmolol , unique short half life quickly titrate achieve target hemodynamic effect well reduce ( loose ) effect quickly unstable situation thereby mitigates undesired hypotension / bradycardia . This study propose assess Safety Efficacy dose target endpoint Esmolol - ultra short act beta blocker - day surgery compare standard long act oral Metoprolol day surgery .</detailed_description>
