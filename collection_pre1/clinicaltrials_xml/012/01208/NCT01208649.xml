	<brief_title>Effects Exenatide ( Byetta® ) Liver Function Patients With Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , chronic liver disease characterize insulin resistance , accumulation hepatic fat hepatocellular necroinflammation , recognize leading cause ( cryptogenic ) liver cirrhosis develop country . Given rise prevalence NASH associate socio-economic burden associate , novel therapeutic option warrant . The incretin mimetic Exenatide ( Byetta® ) exhibit strong glucoregulatory activity multiple biological effect . In addition , exenatide treatment show improve lipid homeostasis reduce body weight . Since development NASH tightly link presence obesity , hyperlipidaemia diabetes , study examine , whether 24 week treatment exenatide also result improvement liver function patient NASH . 60 patient histologically proven NASH randomize receive either exenatide ( 2 x 5 µg s.c. 4 week , 2 x 10 µg thereafter ) placebo treatment , 1:1 ratio . Liver biopsy perform 24 week treatment . In addition , non-invasive assessment hepatic mitochondrial function carried-out use 13C-methionine breath test baseline , week 12 24 . Insulin sensitivity glucose tolerance assess hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp ( baseline week 24 ) oral glucose tolerance test ( baseline , week 12 24 ) . Hepatic fat content measure magnetic resonance tomography . Liver enzymes monitor closely throughout study period . These study clarify whether exenatide treatment , addition beneficial effect glucose homeostasis body weight , also result improvement liver function patient NASH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 18 75 year , inclusive . 2 . Patients present histologically proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ascertain single center pathologist visit 1 2 3 . First liver biopsy obtain later 6 month visit 1 4 . Patients HbA1c exceed 10.0 % . 5 . Patients history stable body weight ( vary &gt; 10 % least 3 month prior screen 1 . Patients investigator site personnel directly affiliate study , immediate family investigator site personnel directly affiliate study . Immediate family define spouse , parent , child , sibling , whether biological legally adopt . 2 . Females childbearing potential pregnant , breastfeed intend become pregnant use adequate contraceptive method ( adequate contraceptive measure include sterilisation , hormonal intrauterine device , oral contraceptive , sexual abstinence vasectomise partner ) . A male subject sexually active surgically sterilise must inform must either use condom intercourse , ensure partner practice contraception , must refrain sexual intercourse trial 1 month completion trial . This prevent possibility pregnancy spermatocytes potentially damage trial medication . It strongly recommend female partner use highly effective contraception ( Pearl Index &lt; 1 % ) . 3 . Patients participate interventional medical , surgical , pharmaceutical study ( study experimental , drug , medical , surgical treatment give ) within 30 day prior screen . This criterion include drug receive regulatory approval indication time study entry . 4 . Patients evidence viral autoimmune hepatitis ( positive testing HBsAG , antiHCV antiHIV , po . AMAscreen , ANAtiter &gt; 1:160 ) 5 . Patients inherit liver disease ( e.g . Wilson 's disease , Hemochromatosis ) 6 . Patients alcohol consumption ( &gt; 20 g daily male &gt; 10 g daily female ) 7 . Patients decompensated liver cirrhosis ( ChildPugh score &gt; 7 ) 8 . Patients alanine aminotransaminase ( ALT ) great ten time upper limit reference range . 9 . Patients great three episode severe hypoglycemia within 6 month prior screen . 10 . Patients undergo therapy malignancy , basal cell squamous cell skin cancer . 11 . Patients cardiac disease Class III IV , accord New York Heart Association criterion . 12 . Patients know allergy hypersensitivity exenatide , excipients contain agent . 13 . Patients concomitant medication thiazolidinediones . 14 . Patients history renal transplantation currently receive renal dialysis serum creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dL male great equal &gt; 1.5 mg/dL female . 15 . Patients know hemoglobinopathy chronic anemia 16 . Patients receive chronic ( lasting longer 2 week ) systemic glucocorticoid therapy ( exclude topical inhale preparation ) receive therapy within 2 week immediately prior screening . 17 . Patients used prescription drug promote weight loss within 3 month prior screen . 18 . Patients condition ( include know drug alcohol abuse psychiatric disorder ) preclude follow complete protocol , opinion investigator . 19 . Patients fail satisfy investigator suitability participate reason .</criteria>
