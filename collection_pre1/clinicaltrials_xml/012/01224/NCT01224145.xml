	<brief_title>Assess Feasibility Efficacy CollaRx® Bupivacaine Implant Men After Laparoscopic Inguinal Umbilical Herniorrhaphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal herniorrhaphy common surgery ; approximately 2,800 per million people United States ( US ) undergo procedure annually.Common surgical method herniorrhaphy include open laparoscopic placement synthetic mesh . Studies show use synthetic mesh greatly reduce risk hernia recurrence regardless method use placement . Furthermore , utilize laparoscopic approach umbilical hernia repair , specifically use mesh , may also reduce risk infection . Bupivacaine local anesthetic ( pain medicine ) establish safety profile . Collagen protein find mammal . The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant thin flat sponge make collagen come cow tendon contain bupivacaine . When inserted surgical site , collagen break bupivacaine release site little absorbed blood stream . The high level bupivacaine surgical site may result less pain several day surgery . This open-label study ass pain intensity surgery patient receive CollaRx Bupivacaine implant well determine feasibility use laparoscope sponge placement laparoscopic hernia repair .</detailed_description>
