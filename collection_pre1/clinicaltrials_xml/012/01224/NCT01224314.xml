	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Potassium abundant cation body ( 35-40 mmol/kg haemodialysis patient [ 1 ] ) , although 2 % pool locate extracellularly [ 2 ] . Whereas , short-term basis , serum potassium regulate shift potassium intracellular extracellular compartment insulin , cathecolamines , acid-base balance , osmolarity ; kidney responsible long-term potassium homeostasis [ 2 ] . Patients end-stage renal disease high risk hyperkalaemia [ 3-6 ] , may present generalised weakness , paralysis , cardiac arrhythmia [ 2 ] . Recovering potassium homeostasis thus important objective dialysis . Still , consider location mainly intracellular , connect pharmacological concept great distribution volume , removal haemodialysis session quantitatively modest ( 40 80 mmol correspond 1-2 % total body potassium ) [ 1 ] . As consequence , even , order suitable , potassium removal dialysis equal amount accumulate inter-dialytic phase , clinical practice potassium concentration dialysate usually adjust suboptimal goal avoid pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia [ 7 ] . The importance body content serum concentration potassium control blood pressure remain controversial . Epidemiological data suggest role potassium depletion co-factor development severity hypertension , dietary potassium inversely correlate blood pressure [ 8-10 ] . In animal model , acute increase serum potassium concentration produce vasodilatation mediate vascular endothelium ; opposite effect observe decrease [ 11,12 ] . In haemodialysis , extent difference serum potassium potassium concentration dialysis fluid directly correlate increase blood pressure end dialysis session , produce name `` rebound hypertension '' [ 1 ] . In study significant change blood pressure find dialysis . In haemodialysis nephrologists face sudden change blood pressure haemodynamic fragility phase multi-factorial origin ; ultrafiltration , decrease osmolarity imbalance correction metabolic acidosis play predominant role [ 13-19 ] . Despite , thanks artifice , particular reference calcium concentration dialysate [ 15 ] , dialysate temperature [ 20 ] ultrafiltration sodium concentration profile [ 18,21-24 ] , pressure stability guarantee general rule . Some electrolyte , particularly sodium bicarbonate , modulate profile purpose well respect gap osmolarity concentration establish haemodialysis session , haemodynamic effect still remain controversial [ 20,22,24 ] . Serum potassium electrolyte whose concentration - order guarantee negative balance - varies rapidly significantly dialysis , frequently result go pre-dialysis hyperpotassaemia intra-dialysis hypopotassaemia . As mentioned , Dolson 's study [ 1 ] , difference dialyse blood pressure find group treat dialysates contain 1 , 2 3 mmol/l potassium , end dialyse patient treat low potassium concentration show call `` rebound hypertension '' . With purpose good characterise phenomenon , redesign study divide dialysis session 3 phase ( fact , clinical practice suggest haemodynamic pattern beginning , intermediate final phase dialysis ) program less sharp drop serum potassium concentration , respect meantime need remove amount potassium usually keep patient steady-state . Using crossover research model , divide dialysis session 3 tertiles potassium concentration dialysate modulate usual concentration study subject two cut-off point +1 e -1 mmol/l respectively . To complete information provide blood pressure , haemodynamics measure non-invasive manner use finger beat-to-beat monitor . The primary end point difference haemodynamic parameter extremes potassium concentration dialysate , incidence hypotension dialysis consider secondary end point . METHODS : Twenty-four chronic haemodialysis patient ( 13 male 11 female ) enrol study . Each patient dialyse 3 4 hour 30 minute three time week clinically stable without intercurrent illness . Using single blind crossover design , patient randomise six dialysate potassium sequence study . Each dialysis session divide three equal part ( tertiles ) : one part potassium concentration dialysate one usually prescribed patient , whereas two part either increase reduce 1 mmol/L . The 6 different permutation repeat twice , patient underwent 12 dialysis session study ( see Table 1 sequence detail ) . The haemodialysis perform use 4008 H machine , equip cartridge bicarbonate Bibag© , high flux single use polysulfone membrane , Fresenius Medical Care ( Bad Homburg , Germany ) . The prescribed dialyser effective surface area , dialysis fluid conductibility , dialysate temperature composition ( exception potassium concentration ) , effective blood flow , dry weight record enrolment study leave unchanged . The medication patient also leave unchanged . Serum potassium patient weight measure begin end dialysis session . Blood sample take arterial limb shunt . Kt/V use quantify haemodialysis adequacy calculate use second generation single-pool Daugirdas formula ( Kt/V = -ln ( R-0.03 ) + [ ( 4-3.5 x R ) x ( UF/W ) ] , R = post-dialysis BUN/pre-dialysis BUN , UF = net ultrafiltration , W = weight , K= dialyzer clearance urea , t= dialysis time , V= patient 's total body water . The incidence hypotension episode ( define systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg ) record . Systolic diastolic blood pressure , heart rate , stroke volume ( integrated mean flow waveform current upstroke dicrotic notch ) total peripheral resistance ( ratio mean arterial pressure stroke volume multiply heart rate ) evaluate begin session every 30 minute use Finometer© finger beat-to-beat monitor ( Finapres Medical Systems BV , Arnhem , The Netherlands ) . Finometer© measure finger blood pressure noninvasively beat-to-beat basis give waveform measurement similar intra-arterial recording . Mean blood pressure ( BPmean ) calculate use follow formula : BPmean= ( BPsyst+2BPdias ) /3 , BPsyst BPdias systolic diastolic blood pressure , respectively . The fluid loss function time consider constant dialysis session record total ultrafiltration . Statistical analysis perform use SAS System ( Statistical Analysis System ) . Comparisons body weight , potassium concentration haemodynamic parameter do first ANOVA follow , significant pair t-test performed mean value obtain patient modality . To improve probability show significant difference , haemodynamic parameter within tertiles compare dialysate potassium concentration cut-off point ( -1 vs. +1 mmol/l ) . Percentages compare use Fisher Exact test . In case , P ≤ 0.05 consider statistically significant ; P express n ( significant ) significant ( P ≤0.05 ) .
