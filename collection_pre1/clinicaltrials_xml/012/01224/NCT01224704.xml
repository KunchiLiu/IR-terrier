	<brief_summary>Background : - One area obese lean individual may different body handle water balance thirst . Studies do animal suggest individual great body fat may tolerate period without water well lean animal . Other research find link ability tolerate period without water increase body weight . Researchers interested study whether ability tolerate period without water ability feel thirst might differ lean versus obese individual . Objectives : - To evaluate effect water deprivation feeling thirst lean obese individual . Eligibility : - Healthy individual least 18 year age either lean ( body mass index le 26 kg/m ( 2 ) ) obese ( body mass index least 35 kg/m ( 2 ) ) . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . - Participants spend entire study ( 13 day ) inpatients National Institutes Health Clinical Center . - Participants follow test procedure : - Body composition assessment ( use low-level x-ray ) determine percentage fat tissue body . - Oral glucose tolerance test ( similar often use diagnose diabetes ) . Individuals suspect diabetes allow continue study . - High salt infusion test , infusion saline ( salt water ) give 2 hour participant respond question hungry thirsty feel procedure . - Water deprivation test , participant go 24 hour without water food respond question hungry thirsty feel . - 24-hour stay metabolic chamber determine many calorie participant burn day . - A series questionnaires participant ' eat habit , feeling food , personal feeling , well computer-based test involve performance various task . - Measurement free-living energy use doubly-labeled water , participant drink sample water extra-heavy atom hydrogen oxygen evaluate amount water body . - 24-hour urine collection . - Frequent blood sample , urine collection , fat tissue biopsy various study procedure . - After end 13-day study , participant return 1 week final urine collection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The percentage people overweight / obesity United States reach high level , 65 % adult age 20 overweight . Recently , number advance understand underlying cause obesity , include great understanding effect environment effect hereditary ( i.e. , genetic ) . One area obese versus lean individual may different body handle water balance thirst . Studies do animal suggest individual great body fat may tolerate period without water well lean animal . Thus , least animal , others find link ability tolerate period without water increase body weight . We study whether ability tolerate period without water ability feel thirst might differ lean versus obese individual . To , ask lean obese individual undergo test include period approximately 24 hour without drinking water , separate day short period intravenous high salt solution infusion . We look ability withstand thirst ( dehydration ) , subsequent water intake ( rehydration ) , change hormone level period , behavioral physiological response thirst rehydration differ lean versus obese individual . We hope data gather study give u information important difference water balance regulate lean versus obese individual . Understanding question may provide new insight difference lean obese individual .</detailed_description>
