	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer second common cause cancer death US . Colonoscopy consider best test colorectal cancer screen . It allow resection adenomatous polyp ( know cancer precursor ) thus , interrupt adenoma-carcinoma sequence . Despite potential benefit screening colonoscopy recent study report case colorectal cancer short interval prior screen surveillance colonoscopy . One possible cause interval cancer may incomplete resection adenomatous polyp hence ongoing growth cancer development lesion . Complete resection may particularly important polyp least 5mm size 10 % polyp high risk lesion villous adenoma , tubulovillous adenoma , high grade dysplasia , early carcinoma . Although adenoma resection sessile flat adenomatous polyp 5 20mm believe well standardize data complete resection adenomatous tissue sparse . This may relate assumption use snare electro-cautery successfully remove polyp cauterize remain marginal adenomatous tissue hence completely remove destroy lesion . The investigator interested examine often sessile adenomatous polyp 5 20mm completely remove use standard polypectomy snare . The investigation also direct comparison complete resection polyp 5 9mm 10 20mm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient present colonoscopy meet inclusion exclusion criterion ask participate , patient resectable polyp include . See also inclusion exclusion criterion . All patient undergone regular bowel preparation polyethylene glycol lavage 4-6 L clear rectal fluid evacuate . Polyp resection perform experienced endoscopists ( 500 colonoscopy perform ) . All polyps 5 20mm remove electro-cautery snare . Polyp size estimate use snare catheter ( 2.5mm ) snare diameter ( 10x20mm , 15x30mm , 20x20mm ) resection . The endoscopist grade difficulty resection . Following resection , endoscopist closely examine resection margin . Biopsies take resection margin : 2 biopsy obtain opposite margin polyps 5-9mm , 4 biopsy take polyps 10-20mm four quadrant resection margin . In case assume incomplete resection document ( piecemeal ) resections do , feasible , margin cauterize accord standard polypectomy resection ( e.g . argon beamer coagulation ) previous biopsy . Only polyps find adenomatous polyp include analysis . If polyp resection complicate bleeding ( self-sustained ) , biopsies take additional polyp find remain examination exclude analysis . Any bleeding margin polypectomy treat endoscopic injection use dilute epinephrine ( 1:10.000 ) . A single research subject may many eligible polyp . To avoid take many biopsy , investigator include 5 eligible polyp ( first 5 detect ) per patient study . Laboratory Analysis : Polyps biopsy send pathology lab center . The polyp evaluate accord common practice . In addition information regard resection margin provide polyp : R0= free adenomatous tissue , R1=adenomatous tissue detect margin . This information routinely provide pathologist far data whether information reliable . Only adenomatous polyp include analysis . Hyperplastic polyp include . Biopsies process diagnosis adenomatous polyp make . Biopsies evaluate presence adenomatous tissue . The additional impact pathology lab include ) processing biopsy belong polyp specimen , b ) provide information polyp margin . The VA pathology lab estimate financial impact low financial request . The pathological diagnosis , include read biopsy , become part medical record . If biopsy contain adenomatous tissue patient ask return follow-up colonoscopy within 1 year . This within current standard care repeat colonoscopy assure complete adenoma resection .</detailed_description>
