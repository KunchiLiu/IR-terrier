	<brief_summary>The current research study evaluate investigational medical device call Amplex B2A ( TM ) Peptide Enhanced Ceramic Granules ( `` Amplex '' ) use foot ankle fusion . Amplex synthetic bone graft material . The frequently use graft material bone collect patient ( autograft ) . Autograft involve secondary incision risk infection last pain . The purpose study determine Amplex safe effective alternative autograft .</brief_summary>
