	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND In renal transplant recipient , residual renal insufficiency combine effect immunosuppressive therapy steroid calcineurin inhibitor may reduce insulin activity may contribute several abnormality associate metabolic syndrome , hypertension , glucose intolerance hyperlipidemia . In turn , insulin resistance , hypertension , hyperglycemia dyslipidemia may importantly contribute excess cardiovascular risk renal transplant patient ( excess comparable diabetes subject diabetic nephropathy ) may also accelerate progressive renal function deterioration promote graft loss . Thus , amelioration insulin activity relate metabolic syndrome key component treatment aim improve patient graft survival renal transplant recipient . Recently , drug peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma activator , ameliorate insulin sensitivity metabolic syndrome , become available . These agent , however , provoke fluid retention , weight gain , edema , case , heart failure . Thus , risk/benefit profile peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma activator still uncertain , particular renal transplant patient risk therapy may overwhelm potential benefit . Recent study show telmisartan , angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist , addition block angiotensin II type 1 - key surface receptor involve regulation blood pressure - may also activate PPAR-gamma , thus improve feature metabolic syndrome , hyperglycemia dyslipidemia people hypertension and/or diabetes . Thus , addition control high blood pressure limit adverse effect angiotensin II , include target organ damage , graft fibrosis cyclosporine ( CsA ) nephrotoxicity , telmisartan may also substantially reduce overall cardiovascular renal risk renal transplant recipient ameliorate modifiable component metabolic syndrome , hypertension , glucose intolerance hyperlipidemia . On hand , telmisartan devoid adverse effect peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma activator fluid retention , therefore remarkably well risk/benefit profile . Thus , whether telmisartan addition beneficial effect reference AII receptor antagonist ( losartan ) may offer adjunctive advantage relate improved insulin sensitivity renal transplant patient chronic therapy steroid and/or calcineurin inhibitor , worth investigate . AIMS The primary aim compare short-term effect telmisartan losartan insulin sensitivity kidney transplant recipient stable renal function concomitant treatment steroid and/or calcineurin inhibitor . DESIGN This pilot , explorative study . On basis previous experimental evidence , crossover study 20 patient power detect statistically significant difference effect insulin activity treatment period compare baseline . Patients randomise 1:1 basis sequence Telmisartan-Losartan sequence losartan-telmisartan .</detailed_description>
