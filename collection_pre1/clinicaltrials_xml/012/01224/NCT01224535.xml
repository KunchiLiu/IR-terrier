	<brief_summary>Introduction : Iron deficiency anaemia remain significant public health challenge . Localized food base approach may offer large opportunity improve live address widespread micronutrient deficiency iron affected household . Viable solution iron rich food readily available may come diversification approach use food amaranth grain report contain high iron content good quality protein conjunction use in-home fortification . Objectives : To determine efficacy maize porridge enrich amaranth flour improve diet quality , iron intake status child 12-59 month semiarid area Kenya . Study population : The study population comprise child age 12-59 month Migwani , within large Mwingi district , Kenya . Mothers principal caretaker interview behalf child . In total , 270 child enrol study . Study design : The study randomize control trial design conduct period 4 months/16 week . Treatment/hypothesis : All participate child require take provide porridge equivalent 80g flour 5 day week 16 week . There 3 treatment group follow ; ( 1 ) maize porridge enrich amaranth grain flour 70:30 maize/amaranth ratio , ( 2 ) maize porridge fortify multiple micronutrient powder ( MixMe™ ) ( 3 ) plain maize porridge group . Hypothesis : significant difference hemoglobin iron status three group . Methods : Blood sample ( 5ml ) collect veni-puncture baseline intervention . Hb concentration , Zinc protoporphyrin ( ZnPP ) malaria infection assess field . Analyses serum ferritin , serum transferrin receptor C-reactive protein ( CRP ) do participate laboratory . Main study parameter/Endpoints : Change Hb concentration primary outcome study . Body iron measure serum ferritin ( SF ) serum transferrin receptor ( STfR ) secondary outcome . Iron deficiency define SF concentration &lt; 12 µg/L tissue iron deficiency define serum transferrin receptor concentration &gt; 8.3mg/L . Infection assess raise CRP ( &gt; 10mg/L ) indicator acute inflammation presence malaria .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Rationale The severe problem micronutrient deficiency find amongst resource poor , food insecure vulnerable household develop country . From 1999 Kenya national survey micronutrient , estimate seven every ten child five year likely anaemic ( Hb &lt; 110g/L ) nearly half ( 43.2 % ) iron deficient . The period complementary feed critical vulnerable time growth development child . Poor complementary feeding practice combine chronic food insecurity find substantially contribute widespread multiple micronutrient deficiency develop country . A recent food consumption study Mwingi district Kenya , show ugali ( stiff maize porridge ) primary complementary food . The use ugali primary complementary food suggest child may risk inadequate micronutrient intake among child 12-23 month . These finding underscore need establish solution increase dietary diversity promote use food rich nutrient iron . Amaranth grain offer prospect considerably improve dietary food diversification semi arid area . Agronomic investigation indicate amaranth grain contains high iron concentration range 7.6-27 mg/100g edible portion . Amaranth grain hardy crop withstand low rainfall . As , grain amaranth may offer viable solution semi-arid area iron rich food animal fortified product readily available . This study therefore design investigate efficacy porridge make amaranth enriched maize flour improve diet quality iron intake child 12-59 month semi-arid area Kenya . Home fortification complementary food use micronutrient powder also show reduce iron deficiency anaemia many resource-poor setting include Kenya . Objectives The primary objective study To determine efficacy maize porridge enrich amaranth grain flour improve iron intake status child 12-59 month semi arid area Kenya . In addition aim : - To determine efficacy amaranth grain enrich maize porridge compare maize porridge fortify micronutrient multi-mix powder ( MixMe™ ) improve iron status intake child 12-59 month . - To determine iron , zinc nutritional status child 12-59 month . Hypothesis We hypothesize : - Children receive amaranth grain enrich maize porridge show great improvement iron status receive plain maize porridge . - Children receive amaranth enrich maize porridge show less improvement iron status receive maize porridge fortify micronutrient multi-mix powder ( MixMe™ ) . Study Area Population The study conduct Migwani within large Mwingi District Eastern Kenya . This area fall within arid semi arid area ( ASAL ) thus experience food shortage part year . The study population comprise child age 12-59 month . Mothers principal caretaker interview behalf child . Study Design The study randomize control trial design conduct period 4 months/16 week . The administrative study area purposively select fall within agro-ecological zone semi-arid area . Random sample total six Sub-locations Migwani do get 4 Sub-locations . Within Sub-location , individual sample unit ( Household child age 12-59 month ) select use random walk method require sample size 68 child achieve per Sub-location . Children meet inclusion criterion shall randomly assign one follow treatment group : 1 . Maize porridge enrich amaranth grain flour 2 . Maize porridge fortify multiple micronutrient powder ( MixMe™ ) 3 . Plain maize porridge</detailed_description>
