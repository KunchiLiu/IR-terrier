	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance crucial factor development type 2 diabetes major health problem old adult . It principal mechanism obesity consider increase risk type 2 diabetes key feature metabolic syndrome . The elevated prevalence obesity type 2 diabetes old population important consequence morbidity mortality well economic burden society . Controversy currently exist whether age contributes insulin resistance . Many potential factor confound association age insulin resistance , include obesity physical inactivity . Ectopic lipid deposition , define excess accumulation triglyceride non adipose tissue liver ( intrahepatic lipid ) within muscle fiber ( intramyocellular lipid ) , positively associate obesity insulin resistance . Furthermore , accumulation intracellular lipid often cite key determinant underlie mechanism insulin resistance . In addition playing important role obesity type 2 diabetes , ectopic fat deposition also observe common condition age physical inactivity . The intervention trial test skeletal muscle , liver heart sedentary obese volunteer , normal weight volunteer master athlete , overall hypothesis exercise improvement fat oxidation capacity and/or decrease damage fat metabolite primary factor predict improvement insulin resistance .</brief_summary>
