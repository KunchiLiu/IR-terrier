	<brief_summary>This companion protocol MD Anderson Cancer Center study 2010-0085 ( Sequential Therapy Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma Therapy : The `` START '' Trial ) . The goal clinical research study learn dynamic contrast enhance compute tomography ( DCE-CT ) scan help researcher learn study drug receive part study 2010-0085 ( either everolimus , bevacizumab , pazopanib ) working .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Contrast Enhancement Computed Tomography Evaluating Tumor Perfusion Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Receiving Targeted Therapies : Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC ) Scramble</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To perform DCE-CT scan , small amount special dye ( call `` CT contrast medium '' ) inject vein body . Several CT image take minute learn much dye spread outside tumor . This show much blood flow tumor . By perform DCE-CT scan several week treatment , researcher may learn change blood flow may sign treatment work . Study Procedures : If find eligible take part study , DCE-CT scan check status disease follow time : - Within 4 week begin treatment study 2010-0085 . - Eight ( 8 ) week start treatment study 2010-0085 . Before DCE-CT scan perform , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn check kidney function . If doctor think need , also standard-of-care CT scan timepoints check status disease . Length Study : Your participation study scan ( ) 8 week start treatment study 2010-0085 . You take study leave 2010-0085 study early . This investigational study . The DCE-CT scan commercially available . Using DCE-CT scan check status kidney cancer investigational . Up 120 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
