	<brief_summary>The aim study ass value whole body diffusion weight MR image ( WB-DWI ) non-invasive method . On one hand pretreatment lesion detection post-therapeutic tumor recurrence also early therapy monitoring intention early identify patient poor tumor response . Our research group demonstrate technique accurate patient head neck cancer could differentiate viable tumor tissue inflammatory necrotic tissue variable time point completion radiotherapy . In literature state DWI also predict response chemotherapeutic therapy . This true focal MRI image ( eg liver ) . This study aim determine whether whole body technique efficiently use distribution metastasis systemic . The study include two phase : In first phase , baseline study conduct ; possible injury type gather determine variability signal characteristic finally determine appropriate threshold differentiate benign malignant lesion . This allow u later perform prospective study . In second phase , different application : - pretherapeutic stag - Detection post-therapy recurrence - Early evaluation systemic cytotoxic therapy . The result DW-MRI compare PET , CT conventional MRI routinely perform diagnosis colorectal tumor . The scan perform group patient 3 Tesla MR system . This system fully approve European American standard patient exposed radiation contrast agent . In principle , patient treat gastrointestinal cancer include informed consent patient . This study important investigate whether DWI accurate pre-therapeutic injury detection stag gastrointestinal tumor compare PET / CT DWI . In addition important predict outcome therapy .</brief_summary>
