	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Safety Tolerability Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Containing LIQ001</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significant advance make design delivery vaccine prevention influenza decade . However , two major hurdle remain global approach influenza prevention . First , recent epidemiology research demonstrate immune response protection elderly population suboptimal result significant seasonal influenza disease population every year . Second , preparation emergence pandemic influenza strain progress , current egg-based manufacturing method provide sufficient global capacity . Furthermore , genesis scale-up manufacturing platform rapidly solve problem . Thus , safe effective way need improve protection elderly well reduce antigen dose young population preparation global need pandemic vaccine . Historically known presentation antigen particulate form , wide range pathogen , clear advantage presentation soluble antigen alone . A novel approach use highly uniform particle develop utilizes size , shape , composition control delivery presentation vaccine antigen ( ) immune system . Production highly uniform particle possible proprietary manufacturing approach call Pattern Replication Non-wetting Templates ( PRINT® ) . The propose approach use PRINT process make bioabsorbable particle improve immune response efficacy seasonal influenza vaccine . It propose mix properly size charge particle commercial trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) increase vaccine effectiveness and/or decrease amount antigen necessary induce immune response .</detailed_description>
