	<brief_summary>Background : Chordoma rare , slow growing , often fatal bone cancer derive remnant embryonic notochord . It occur mostly axial skeleton ( skull base , vertebra , sacrum coccyx ) , frequent male female , median age diagnosis 58.5 year , wide age range . This typically sporadic tumor often advanced presentation , mortality high due local recurrence distant metastasis . The usual treatment surgery , follow adjuvant radiation therapy . Chemotherapy significant treatment role . Reports small number family worldwide two relative chordoma support role susceptibility gene chordoma etiology . Recently determine duplication T gene co-segregated disease four multiplex chordoma family . The T gene encodes brachyury , tissue-specific transcription factor express notochord cell essential formation maintenance notochord . Some chordoma family study T-gene duplication ; aggregation chordomas family may result change susceptibility gene type mutation target T gene . We continue gene identification study multiplex chordoma family NIH Clinical Center protocol 78-C-0039 . We also want determine whether alteration identify chordoma susceptibility gene associate sporadic chordoma general population . Objectives : The major goal protocol identify sporadic chordoma patient willing provide germline tumor DNA study determine frequency alteration chordoma susceptibility gene . Our previous protocol SEER Massachusetts General Hospital identify chordoma patient limited resident specific geographic region U.S. ( 2 state 2 metropolitan area ) patient pediatric skull base tumor . This protocol enroll patient broadly represent age , site gender distribution sporadic chordoma general U.S. population . Eligibility : Eligible patient male female U.S. chordoma diagnose age primary site . Because want obtain saliva participant , eligibility limit patient great equal age 6 year time enrollment . Design : The study description contact information include e-mail link study contact person post web site two chordoma support group . We mail study information give patient colleague major medical center treat chordoma . The component study carried subject ' home use material mail . Up 100 participant : 1 ) complete self-administered Personal Family Medical History Questionnaire , 2 ) collect saliva use saliva collection kit , 3 ) provide permission obtain medical/pathology record , paraffin block slide primary chordoma . Parents serve proxy minor child . We recontact patient report chordoma least one blood relative . If confirm relative 's chordoma diagnosis , invite study subject select family member participate clinical gene map study protocol 78-C-0039 . We may also recontact study participant tell new study chordoma etiology . They decide time whether want participate .</brief_summary>
