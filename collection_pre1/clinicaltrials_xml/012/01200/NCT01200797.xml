	<brief_title>SJG-136 Treating Patients With Epithelial Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer That Did Not Respond Previous Treatment With Cisplatin Carboplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall response rate SJG-136 patient persistent recurrent platinum-refractory epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube carcinoma . II . To assess nature degree toxicity regimen patient . III . To determine parameter response , include progression-free survival , overall survival , time progression patient treat regimen . Correlative Endpoints : I . To correlate response rate degree DNA adduct formation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) tumor cell measure single-cell gel electrophoresis ( Comet ) assay Î³-H2AX assay . II . To assess whether rate DNA adduct formation PBMCs correlate rate DNA adduct formation tumor cell . III . To evaluate BRCA1 protein expression archival tissue specimens patient 's primary tumor reductive surgery . IV . To determine ability BRCA1 protein repairing/removing DNA-adducts PBMCs tumor tissue . VI . To evaluate effect BRCA1 protein expression overall response rate SJG-136 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive SJG-136 IV 20 minute day 1-3 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically study correlative study . Tumor tissue sample may also collect . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day annually thereafter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must persistent recurrent epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube carcinoma , histologic confirmation original primary tumor . Must least one prior platinumbased ( cisplatin carboplatin ) chemotherapy regimen management primary disease . This would include intraperitoneal chemotherapy . Must consider platinum refractory resistant , define patient progression disease platinumbased chemotherapy , patient persistent disease completion platinumbased chemotherapy , patient disease free interval follow prior platinum therapy less six month . May three prior treatment regimens epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube carcinoma . Consolidation maintenance therapy initiate within six week completion primary therapy count additional regimen . Must measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Time interval last chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery least four week patient must recover significant adverse effect prior treatment . Patients must least six week receive nitrosoureas mitomycin C. Life expectancy great three month . Must adequate bone marrow organ function : Leukocyte count &gt; 3 x 10^9/L Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count &gt; 100 x 10^9/L Total bilirubin Within normal institutional limit Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance ( ClCr ) &gt; 60 ml/min Cockcroft Gault method , . ClCr = weight ( kg ) x ( 140age ) x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) Participants must sign approve informed consent . Participants childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior study entry must use effective form contraception . Must archival tissue available original tumor debulking surgery assessment BRCA1 protein expression . Patients borderline ovarian tumor , ovarian germ cell tumor , ovarian sexcord stromal tumor , nonepithelial ovarian tumor eligible . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients receive radiation therapy 25 % bone marrow . Patients previously receive SJG136 related compound . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Prior malignancy ( cervical carcinoma situ , ductal carcinoma situ breast , nonmelanoma skin cancer ) unless treat curative intent without evidence disease three year . With exception alopecia ( situation organ dysfunction symptom consider clinically insignificant irrelevant study ) , patient may baseline organ dysfunction symptom qualify grade 2 high CTEP Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE ) v4.0 . Particular attention pay assessment preexisting edema , since vascular leak syndrome dose limit toxicity agent phase I trial .</criteria>
