	<brief_summary>Background : - The drug rosuvastatin ( also call Crestor ) use low cholesterol level people elevate cholesterol level . Recent study suggest rosuvastatin may affect immune system reduce inflammation , reason effect unclear . Researchers interested test effect rosuvastatin immune system healthy volunteer good cholesterol level . Objectives : - To evaluate effect rosuvastatin immune system healthy volunteer . Eligibility : - Healthy individual least 18 year age acceptable blood level LDL cholesterol ( 160 ) . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical examination , well blood test check general health , cholesterol level , liver function , C-reactive protein ( respond inflammation ) . - Participants permit take prescription over-the-counter medication affect immune system , include antihistamine certain pain reliever . For 1 week study , participant wash-out period without medication . - Participants take rosuvastatin daily 4 week , always even ( ensure consistent blood sample result ) . - Participants provide blood sample follow time point : ( 1 ) immediately start rosuvastatin treatment , ( 2 ) 2 week treatment , ( 3 ) 4 week treatment , ( 4 ) 2 week end treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Statins drug inhibit cholesterol synthesis use extensively primary secondary prevention heart disease . Their benefit patient heart diseases appear exceed predict cholesterol lower alone . A recent study find benefit statin therapy patient normal cholesterol high C-reactive protein , marker inflammation , suggest statin exert anti inflammatory effect addition well know cholesterol lower activity . Studies mouse reveal mixed observation regard role statin inflammation . Therefore Center Human Immunology , Autoimmunity Inflammation conduct trial study effect statins immune system inflammatory response healthy volunteer normal cholesterol level , normal elevate C-reactive protein level . The primary objective characterize immune system statin therapy .</detailed_description>
