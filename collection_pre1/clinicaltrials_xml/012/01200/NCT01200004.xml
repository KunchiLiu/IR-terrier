	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination Grifola frondosa extract , azacitidine , lenalidomide give patient advanced cancer . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Grifola Frondosa ( Maitake ) , Azacitidine , Lenalidomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : Azacitidine design block certain protein cancer cell whose job stop function tumor-fighting protein . By block `` bad '' protein , tumor-fighting gene may able work well . Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . This may decrease growth cancer cell . Grifola frondosa extract natural substance take maitake mushroom . Researchers want learn cause body 's immune system react cancer . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign receive either azacitidine lenalidomide , azacitidine Grifola frondosa , azacitidine , lenalidomide , Grifola frondosa dose level base join study . Up 4 dose level azacitidine lenalidomide test . Up 2 dose level azacitidine Grifola frondosa test . At begin study , 3-6 participant enrol dose level study drug combination . The first group participant receive low dose level azacitidine lenalidomide . Each new group receive high dose study drug combination group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose study drug combination find . After enrollment azacitidine lenalidomide group complete , next group participant receive low dose level azacitidine Grifola frondosa . Each new group receive high dose study drug combination group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose study drug combination find . After high dose azacitidine lenalidomide Grifola frondosa combination find , new participant enrol study begin receive Grifola frondosa along azacitidine lenalidomide . Up 2 dose level test . The first group participant receive low dose level lenalidomide . The next group receive high dose lenalidomide group , intolerable side effect see . The dos azacitidine Grifola frondosa stay . The dose study drug combination receive may lower intolerable side effect . Study Drug Administration : A study drug `` cycle '' 28 day . On Days 1-5 Cycle , receive azacitidine either skin vein . If receive azacitidine injection skin , receive 10 minute . If receive azacitidine vein , receive 40 minute . On Day 2 Cycle 1 , begin take lenalidomide 1 time day Day 21 , 7 day-rest period . For Cycle 2 every cycle , take lenalidomide 1 time day Days 1-21 follow 7-day rest period . Lenalidomide capsule take mouth water . The capsule swallow whole . You break , chew , open capsule . If assign receive Grifola frondosa , also begin take Grifola frondosa 2 time day Day 2 Cycle 1 also take azacitidine . If also take azacitidine lenalidomide , begin take Grifola frondosa Day 3 Cycle 1 . Depending dose level assign , either take Grifola frondosa 2 time day Day 21 follow 7-day rest period , take Grifola frondosa 2 time daily cycle . Grifola frondosa liquid extract come glass bottle . Your dose Grifola frondosa base join study body weight . Expansion Groups : After high tolerable dose study drug combination find , 42 additional participant enrol 3 expansion group ( 14 group ) , one group study drug combination high tolerable dose dose level show safe . Study Visits : The following test procedure perform within 7 day first dose study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . Women able child must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test within 10 14 day first dose study drug combination within 24 hour receive lenalidomide . Before begin cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You ask side effect may . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . - Women able child blood pregnancy test . Every week Cycles 1 2 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Women able child blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test every week Cycle 1 . At end every 2 cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) , CT , MRI , PET scan , and/or x-ray check status disease . If one Expansion Groups , blood ( 6 teaspoon time ) drawn biomarker test take first dose study drug , Days 21 28 Cycle 1 , 1 time cycle , end-of-study visit . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug combination , end-of-study visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You ask side effect may . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . - If study doctor think need , chest x-ray , CT , MRI , and/or PET scan check status disease . - Women able child blood pregnancy test . This investigational study . Grifola frondosa extract FDA approve usage . Its use study investigational . Azacitidine lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment multiple myeloma myelodysplastic syndrome . The use study drug combination ( Grifola frondosa , azacitidine , lenalidomide ) currently use research purpose . Up 102 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
