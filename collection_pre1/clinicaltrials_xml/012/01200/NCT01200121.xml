	<brief_summary>Malignant ascites represent severe clinical problem physicians patient confronted common symptom advanced-stage gastrointestinal cancer . Unfortunately , standardize evidence-based treatment malignant ascites therapy commonly use temporarily effective . Newer modes therapy , application tri-functional antibody catumaxomab , associate significant side effect limit patient stage good overall performance . Therefore , still urgent need effective , longer-lasting , less toxic mode treatment peritoneal effusion cause gastrointestinal cancer . Preclinical data strongly suggest bevacizumab might effective agent treatment malignant ascites , large part cause hyperpermeability-promoting factor VEGF . Emerging clinical result cancer patient malignant ascites treat bevacizumab add support idea . Bevacizumab test variety large clinical trial , good toxicity profile , effective number human cancer underlie malignant ascites . In present study , Bevacizumab administer intraperitoneal infusion absolute standardize dosage 400 mg . This dosage choose comparable approved standard dosage intravenous administration also use study report successful safe intraperitoneal administration Bevacizumab patient malignant ascites . Finally , standardized dosage seem practical particular patient population treat study .</brief_summary>
