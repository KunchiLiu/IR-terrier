	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn SB939 help control myelofibrosis . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study SB939 Subjects With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : SB939 design change DNA ( genetic material ) cancer cell . This may keep cell grow cause die . This first study SB939 give patient myelofibrosis . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take SB939 mouth 3 time week first 3 week every 4-week cycle . In case , study doctor may decide dose raise sometime Cycle 1 . SB939 take time day , 2 hour 2 hour meal . You take SB939 time day . Do open , break , chew capsule . If side effect , doctor may change amount often take SB939 . You fill study drug diary keep track SB939 dose . You bring diary use unused bottle study drug every study visit . Study Visits : At every study visit , ask side effect drug may take . On Day 1 Cycle 1 ( +/- 3 day ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask blood transfusion drug take since last visit . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ECG take medication , 10 minute take medication , 4-6 hour take medication . On Day 8 Cycle 1 ( +1-3 day ) , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 15 Cycle 1 ( +/- 3 day ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ECG take medication , 10 minute take medication , 4-6 hour take medication . On Day 22 Cycle 1 ( +1-3 day ) , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 3 ( +/- 3 day ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask blood transfusion since last visit . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ECG . On Day 1 Cycles 4 beyond ( +/- 3 day ) , every 3 cycle start Day 1 Cycle 6 ( +/- 3 day ) doctor decides schedule change ( serious side effect ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask blood transfusion drug take since last visit . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow biopsy aspiration check status disease , doctor think need . - You ECG every visit MD Anderson . If study visit schedule change every 3 cycle ( Day 1 Cycles 6 , 9 , ) , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test every 28 day ( +/- 3 day ) . These test do local doctor 's office . Every 28 day ( +/- 3 day ) , study staff also call ask side effect . You may additional bone marrow biopsy aspiration ECGs time doctor think need . The study visit may also occur often describe , doctor think need . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , need radiation therapy , surgery , chemotherapy . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment visit follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit : After stop taking study drug reason , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask blood transfusion drug take since last visit . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow biopsy aspiration check status disease , doctor think need . Follow-up : The study staff call 30 day 60 day last dose study drug ( +/- 3 day ) . You ask side effect . If side effect within 60 day stop take study drug , may extra test procedure . For example , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) may draw routine test . If still side effect , study staff continue call ask side effect get well . The schedule often call depend side effect . This investigational study . SB939 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 41 patient take part study . All enrol University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
