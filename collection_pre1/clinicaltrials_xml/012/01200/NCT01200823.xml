	<brief_summary>Background : - The Center Human Immunology , Autoimmunity , Inflammatory Diseases ( CHI ) conduct variety laboratory research experiment require blood , bone marrow , urine , stool , and/or tissue sample patient diagnosis immunologic , autoimmune , inflammatory disorder , well healthy relative . Donated sample send CHI laboratory National Institutes Health use research may provide information change immune system cause specific disorder . Objectives : - To collect blood , leukapheresis cell , bone marrow , urine , stool , cheek swab , tissue sample patient immune-mediated inflammatory disease , well family member , ongoing exploratory research study . Eligibility : - Individuals least 2 year age diagnose immune-mediated inflammatory disease , sign symptom immune inflammatory disease without formal diagnosis . - Immediate family member ( parent , child , sibling , grandchild ) mention individual . Design : - Participants screen complete medical history , physical examination , blood urine sample . - Participants provide blood , urine , stool , cheek swab , tissue sample require study researcher . - Participants immune inflammatory disease also provide blood bone marrow sample collect biopsy leukapheresis ( collect specific blood cell ) . - Adult relative provide additional sample invasive procedure leukapheresis bone marrow biopsy . Child relatives ( 2 18 year age ) undergo invasive procedure . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Clinical investigator Center Human Immunology , Autoimmunity , Inflammatory Diseases ( CHI ) study pathophysiology wide variety immune-mediated inflammatory disease . One goal CHI good understand disease refine therapeutic approach use management base knowledge underlie pathophysiologies . This require sample patient immune-mediated inflammatory disease clinical laboratory assessment . Collection sample family member necessary identify genetic component specific condition . We expect great majority publication Center Human Immunology , Autoimmunity , Inflammatory Diseases ( CHI ) next several decade generate exploratory laboratory research study do use blood bone marrow tissue sample patient family member . These publication expect number hundred . Ongoing future research project depend ready availability sample blood , tissue , leukapheresed cell , bone marrow patient vitro study . OBJECTIVE To provide mechanism collection blood , bone marrow , leukapheresis cell , urine , stool , buccal mucosa and/or tissue sample patient immune-mediated inflammatory disease , well family member ongoing exploratory research study . STUDY DESIGN This study treatment protocol . This sample clinical data procurement protocol . All subject condition interest see NIH Clinical Center first enrol onto CHI protocol 09-H-0201 Screening protocol subject evaluate Center Human Immunology , Autoimmunity , Inflammatory Diseases ( CHI ) protocol . Patients require specific medical intervention enrol receive treatment another NIH CHI Clinical Center protocol care home health care provider . In exceptional case possible patient travel Clinical Center , may allow option give consent provide sample research study , include genetic analysis , perform blood , buccal mucosa , bone marrow , tissue sample send local physician without enrol onto 09-H-0201 . Information obtain retrospectively review medical record examination archive material and/or prospectively clinical examination laboratory test . The protocol write indefinite period time subject accrual occur NIH Clinical Center home health care provider ( site ) .</detailed_description>
