	<brief_summary>This multi-center , parallel , active comparator control , open-label , randomize ( 1:1 ) phase III study single agent ofatumumab compare single agent rituximab subject rituximab-sensitive indolent B-cell non hodgkin lymphoma relapse least 6 month complete treatment single agent rituximab rituximab-containing regimen . Subjects must attain Complete Response Partial Response last prior rituximab contain therapy last least six month beyond end rituximab therapy . Subjects receive four weekly dos single agent ofatumumab ( 1000 mg ) rituximab ( 375 mg/m2 ) , follow ofatumumab ( 1000 mg ) rituximab ( 375 mg/m2 ) every 2 month four additional dos . Therefore , subject receive total eight dos anti-CD20 antibody 9 month . Subjects evaluate response completion first four dos therapy , six dos therapy , completion study therapy . Subjects follow end designate follow-up period ( total study duration 200 week ) meet withdrawal criterion .</brief_summary>
