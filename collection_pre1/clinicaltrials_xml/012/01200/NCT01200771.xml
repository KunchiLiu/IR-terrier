	<brief_summary>Fever unknown origin ( FUO ) chronic inflammatory syndrome could see many affection . The diagnostic process still challenge could specify yet several clinical study perform trained team use two level diagnostic procedure . For reason , diagnosis involve many additional expensive test compute tomography ( CT scan ) , scintigraphic imaging , endoscopy , biopsy . There evidence-based recommendation diagnostic work-up FUO chronic inflammatory syndrome . Positron emission tomography 2- [ 18F ] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose combine CT scan ( FDG-PET/CT ) widely use malignant diseases seem promising diagnosis inflammatory disorder . Its role yet clearly define investigation FUO chronic inflammatory syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient FUO chronic inflammatory syndrome undergo FDG-PET/CT conventional morphologic image modality . Results two diagnostic procedure identify diagnostic clue compare . We assume FDG-PET/CT could safer helpful reach early final diagnosis patient FUO chronic inflammatory syndrome conventional morphologic imaging modality</detailed_description>
