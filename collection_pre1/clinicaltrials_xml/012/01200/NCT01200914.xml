	<brief_summary>Balloon angioplasty use open narrow form hemodialysis fistula . Two area particular problem terminal portion cephalic vein near shoulder central vein chest . Although angioplasty standard care treat narrowed segment vein mostly renarrow within 3 month require retreatment keep dialysis access functional . Recently introduction new technology call cover stent graft . Initial study suggest place device across area narrow lead dialysis access stay open longer need less angioplasty treatment . This study design compare angioplasty ( standard care ) versus use covered stent graft . The investigator look dialysis record future fistulograms see decrease flow fistula 3 , 6 12 month initial procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , prospective , unblinded study 1:1 randomization . Both group undergo PTA stenotic lesion patient randomize 50 % receive cover stent addition PTA . Patients follow 3 , 6 , 12 month post-procedure . Follow-up conduct either angiographic and/or transonic measurement .</detailed_description>
