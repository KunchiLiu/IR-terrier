	<brief_title>Metabolic Impact Fructose Restriction Obese Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study suggest specific type macronutrients diet may selective effect nutrient absorption , insulin sensitivity , lipid metabolism . Elucidation metabolic impact specific dietary component may well result improve efficacy lifestyle approach reduce obesity metabolic disease . Despite similar fructose consumption , phenotype co-morbidities different African Americans Latinos . Latino Caucasian child manifest worsen dyslipidemia non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , African American child manifest worsen insulin resistance hypertension . We also document adult reduction de novo lipogenesis ( DNL ; production new lipid ) liver liver fat content , improvement hepatic insulin sensitivity achieve substitution complex carbohydrate fructose ; change appear less dramatic African American compare Latino Caucasian subject . These divergent finding suggest ethnic race-specific difference fructose metabolism disposition . To determine whether fructose contributor metabolic co-morbidity child , conduct convenience cohort within-subject intervention repeat measure , stratify racial/ethnic group ( Latinos vs. African Americans vs. Caucasians ) . The intervention consist restrict fructose ingestion naturally-occurring fructose fruit vegetable ( approximately 15 gm/day 10 day ) , substitute complex carbohydrate excess dietary fructose , maintain neutral energy balance . We anticipate fructose restriction differentially improve co-morbidities different racial/ethnic group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>AfricanAmerican , Latino , Caucasian boys girl . Ethnicity determine selfreport . Utilizing US Census Bureau procedure , participant ask two question , first regard ethnicity second race . Subjects give opportunity select one racial category . Ages 8 18 yr . The minimum age cutoff due desire sedate young child magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan magnetic resonance scan ( MRS , MRI ) . We choose study group affect metabolic syndrome manifest great morbidity ; yet presentation different . The following criterion modify National Cholesterol Education Program 's Adult Treatment Panel World Health Organization definition metabolic syndrome . Waist circumference adequate predictor visceral adiposity child . Also , normative value develop measurement consistent racial ethnic group . Body mass index ( BMI ) , however , correlate strongly visceral lipid depot blood pressure . The definition hypertension great 95th percentile sex age designate 1996 Task Force Report High Blood Pressure Children Adolescents . 1 . Obesity , define BMI zscore 2.0 great , 97th percentile age sex ; weight ≥40 kg . 2 . Hyperinsulinemia ( fast insulin &gt; 15 µU/mL ) , insulin resistant ( HOMA &gt; 4.3 ) . See detail . 3 . At least one following : systolic blood pressure 95th percentile age sex , triglyceride level 95th percentile age , sex race ethnic group establish 1998 National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute Growth Health Study . History disorder obesity may affect insulin level , Cushing 's syndrome , diabetes mellitus , depression . Medications may affect insulin sensitivity hepatic lipid content , e.g . metformin , steroid , atypical antipsychotic , anti depressant , statin , Vitamin E , thyroid medication , antihypertensive , weight loss medication , oral contraceptive . Pregnancy lactation . Surgical procedure obesity . History consistent obstructive sleep apnea . Implants include intracranial surgical clip , pacemaker , metal implant preclude MR scanning . Claustrophobia . Inability fit within MR bore : shoulder shoulder width great 58 cm anteriorposterior length great 35 cm ( magnet bore size limitation ) . Weight great 320 pound ( MRS table weight limitation ) . Eating disorder . Smoking alcohol use . Subjects answer two question Alcohol Query Form . Any consumption 2 drink per month Vegan diet . All subject know diabetes mellitus accord 1997 ADA criterion exclude . However , subject know impaired glucose tolerance ( fast glucose 101125 , 2hour postprandial glucose level 141200 ) remain eligible . Syndromic patient ( e.g . PraderWilli , BardetBiedl ) exclude , likely reason obesity may neurologic singlepoint mutation , likely different cause Metabolic Syndrome . Subjects find hypothyroid clinical exam evaluation thyroid function test first visit WATCH Clinic receive Lthyroxine three month , documentation adequate replacement , prior enrollment protocol . Subjects history hepatitis exclude study . However , patient NAFLD , determine Dr. P. Rosenthal ( Ped . Hepatology , UCSF ) , may participate . Upper cutoffs AST ALT 5 time upper limit normal UCSF laboratory . Subjects history renal disease exclude . Subjects fever active infection postpone infection remit . Emancipated minor exclude , parental supervision monitoring subject 's diet 9 day fructose restriction . Females achieve menarche urine pregnancy test time DEXA scan . A positive pregnancy test lead exclusion data analysis . Results positive pregnancy test transmit minor , parent tell subject qualify study .</criteria>
