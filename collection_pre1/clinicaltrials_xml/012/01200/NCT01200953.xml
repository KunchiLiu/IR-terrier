	<brief_summary>Background : - Increased clinical attention pay evaluation management bioterrorism-related illness ( anthrax infection ) emerge infectious disease ( Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [ SARS ] new strain influenza ) . However , evaluation treatment data illness often limited human infection date relatively limited . Further knowledge disease bioterrorism concern emerge infectious disease may lead effective form therapy prevent disease-related illness death . Objectives : - To apply standardized , document , carefully monitor evaluation treatment method bioterrorism- biodefense-related illness emerge infectious disease National Institutes Health Clinical Center . Eligibility : - Individuals least 2 year age confirm suspected infection biodefense bioterrorism agent , emerge infectious disease agent . - Individuals least 2 year age confirm suspected exposure biodefense bioterrorism agent , emerge infectious disease agent , close exposure individual suspect infected one agent . - Health care worker involve medical treatment abovementioned infect exposed individual . Design : - All eligible person initial screen evaluation determine circumstance possible infectious exposure ( e.g. , , , expose ) , current medical condition medical care give , aspects medical history might relevant exposure . - Participants may see outpatient clinic Special Clinical Studies Unit ( SCSU ) National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . The NIH SCSU hospital ward specially design minimize risk spread infection others . - Upon admission , participant provide blood urine sample , electrocardiogram measure heart activity , specific test procedure associate particular infectious agent . - Participants develop illness treat standard care know disease experimental measure , depend nature illness . Separate consent may require treatment . - Participants remain study least 1 year follow period active evaluation treatment . Participants may ask come NIH outpatient clinic periodic basis medical evaluation blood test , may ask keep diary card record unusual sign symptom possible infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since fall 2001 distribution letter contain Bacillus anthracis spore via US postal system , increased attention pay evaluation management bioterrorism-related illness . Similarly , emergence Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) infectious disease , along ongoing threat global influenza pandemic , foster intensive interest evaluation management emerge infection US internationally . Data end often limit , however , many disease exist nature , human illness may rarely occur . The primary purpose protocol apply standardize , document , carefully monitor evaluation prophylactic treatment measure event suspect confirmed exposure causative agent disease bioterrorism concern ( whether natural deliberate origin ) , agent study biodefense-related research laboratory , emerge infectious disease pathogen . Other goal include characterization natural history clinical course disease via evaluation close contact potentially exposed person , well recovered illness ; elucidation pathophysiology disease ; characterization immune responses disease ; evaluation diagnostic test rapid identification causative agent diseases clinical specimen . Further knowledge disease bioterrorism concern emerge infectious disease may lead effective form therapy improve disease-related morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
