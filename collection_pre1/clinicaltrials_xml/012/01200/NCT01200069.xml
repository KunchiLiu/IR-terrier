	<brief_title>IV Ibuprofen Post-Electroconvulsive Therapy Myalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IV ibuprofen ( trade name Caldolor ) novel therapeutic modality approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) June 2009 treatment mild moderate pain , adjunct opioid analgesic , reduction fever . Ibuprofen non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , produce effect inhibition enzyme cyclooxygenase ( COX ) . There least 2 variation cyclooxygenase ( COX-1 COX-2 ) ibuprofen non-selectively inhibits , thus decrease prostaglandin synthesis . This action give ibuprofen analgesic , anti-pyretic , anti-inflammatory property . NSAIDs establish history efficacy treatment acute chronic somatic pain . Caldolor , intravenous formulation , offer distinct advantage patient either unable take medication orally fast preoperatively . Post-procedure myalgia well-known common complication ECT . Although exact etiology unknown , myalgias believe result combination succinylcholine administration seizure activity induce ECT procedure . Succinylcholine-induced postoperative myalgia well-known phenomenon , initially describe early 1950 's . The exact pathogenesis unknown , muscle damage succinylcholine-induced fasciculation calcium-mediated phospholipase A2 activation prostaglandin production propose possible etiology . The latter mechanism provide rationale use NSAID therapy . However , succinylcholine unlikely factor involve development myalgia follow ECT , recent study show dose adjustment succinylcholine affect rate myalgia patient . Furthermore , seizures also cause direct muscle injury report muscle pain ECT without succinylcholine . A thorough literature search use Medline , Ovid , scholar.google fail find research article evaluate pretreatment therapy myalgias post-ECT patient . The current practice treatment myalgia follow ECT extrapolate research succinylcholine-induced myalgia post-surgical patient . Previous study show least partial efficacy pretreatment nondepolarizing neuromuscular block agent , benzodiazepine , sodium channel blocker ( predominantly lidocaine ) , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug . The nature ECT procedure make several modality undesirable . Both Lidocaine benzodiazepine alter seizure threshold short duration procedure possibly increase risk associate longer act nondepolarizing muscle relaxant ( ie . blur vision , diplopia , difficulty breathe swallow ) . Therefore , option pretreatment limit . In addition , recent meta-analysis randomize trial determine NSAIDs cumulatively best efficacy pretreatment therapy prevention post-procedural myalgia . Due intravenous formulation , practitioner administer ketorolac ECT patient procedure . However , despite proven efficacy myalgia prevention show NSAIDs class , study specifically examine use ketorolac regard fail show benefit . The use Ibuprofen yet examine . Myalgias serious concern patient occur approximately 50 % case . The pain usually describe muscle soreness , similar result strenuous exercise . The myalgia typically begin shortly procedure , last approximately 2-7 day total . A recent study report 89 % patient consider prevention significant would willing pay median $ 33 pocket avoid side effect . In addition patient discomfort , myalgias financial burden patient unable return work resume previous daily activity day follow procedure . An agent could treat possibly even prevent myalgias potential beneficial patient . Experimental Plan : The study prospective , randomize , double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial . The subject population consist patient undergo first time electroconvulsive therapy , range age 18 80 year . Subjects give Mini-Mental State Examination time presentation ECT ass cognitive ability . If patient consent fit inclusion criterion , patient randomize one treatment modality , receive first three treatment session . The subject person collect data blind treatment modality subject belongs . The patient divide two group , Group 1 Group 2 . Group 1 treat IV ibuprofen 800mg/8ml give 30 minute , prior induction ECT ; Group 2 receive identically appear placebo dose , also administer IV , time period . Both group receive standardize anesthetic consist methohexital 1 mg/kg IV induction succinylcholine 1 mg/kg IV muscle paralysis . Other medication ( eg . anticholinergic antihypertensive drug ) administer discretion anesthesiologist . ECT administer psychiatrist order achieve seizure motor component &gt; 15 second duration . Patients transported recovery room post-anesthesia care . Rescue analgesic ( Tylenol 500mg PO , Tylenol codeine 300/30mg PO , Fentanyl 25 mcg IV ) available patient complaint myalgia headache pain VAS &gt; 4 . Measurement Tools : Severity myalgia assess base self-reported assessment utilize numerical rating scale ( NRS ) . The scale rat 0 meaning pain 10 meaning pain severe interfere daily activity . Questionnaire : Do muscle ache pain right ? If yes , would rate muscle ache/pain scale 0 10 , 0 pain 10 pain worst imaginable ? Example : 0 = No pain 1-3 = Mild Pain ( nagging , annoy , little interference everyday activity ) 4-6 = Moderate Pain ( interfere significantly everyday activity ) 7-10 = Severe Pain ( unable perform everyday activity ) Have take medication treat muscle ache ? If yes , medication take ? How many pill ? What strength medication ? Do headache right ? If yes , would rate headache scale 0 10 , 0 pain 10 pain worst imaginable ? Measurements : Each patient self-reported numerical pain score assess baseline therapy , 1 hour post-ECT , 6 hour post-ECT , 24 hour post-ECT , finally 48 hour post-ECT . The 6 , 24 48 hour post-ECT assessment conduct via telephone conversation . The use rescue analgesic recovery also document well time end procedure discharge . The presence headache also document patient .</detailed_description>
