	<brief_title>High-Dose Gemcitabine , Busulfan Melphalan Patients With Refactory Hodgkin 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : Busulfan melphalan design kill cancer cell bind DNA ( genetic material cell ) , may cause cancer cell die . They commonly use stem cell transplantation . Gemcitabine design disrupt growth cancer cell , may cause cancer cell die . It may help increase effect busulfan melphalan cancer cell allow cell repair DNA damage cause busulfan melphalan . Apheresis : Your cell previously collect procedure call apheresis . Apheresis process filter part blood body order remove stem cell . The rest blood return back body . You sign separate consent procedure . Busulfan Test Dose : You receive test dose busulfan vein 1 hour . This low-level test dose busulfan check level busulfan blood level change time . This information use decide next dose need reach target blood level match body size . You likely receive outpatient week admit hospital . If give outpatient , admitted hospital Day -11 ( 11 day stem cell return body ) test dose give Day -10 . About 11 sample blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test busulfan . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point help study doctor determine dose busulfan study . These blood sample draw various timepoints receive busulfan next 11 hour . The blood sample repeat first day high-dose busulfan treatment ( Day -8 ) . A temporary heparin lock line place vein low number needle stick need draws . If possible PK test perform technical scheduling reason , receive standard fix dose busulfan . If receive busulfan test dose outpatient : On Days -12 Day -10 , receive palifermin vein 30 second day help decrease risk side effect mouth throat . You admit Day -9 receive fluid vein . You begin swish liquid caphosol glutamine mouth 4 time day , 2 minute time . You swish liquid every day leave hospital . These drug also use help decrease risk side effect mouth throat . If receive busulfan test dose inpatient : On Days -13 Day -11 , receive palifermin vein 30 second day help decrease risk side effect mouth throat . You admit Day -11 receive fluid vein . You begin swish liquid caphosol glutamine mouth 4 time day , 2 minute time . You swish liquid every day leave hospital . These drug also use help decrease risk side effect mouth throat . On Day -10 receive Busulfan test dose vein 1 hour . Study Drug Administration ( patient ) : On Days -9 -2 , receive dexamethasone vein 15 minute help decrease risk possible side effect study drug . On Days -8 -5 , receive busulfan vein 3 hour day . On Days -8 -3 , receive gemcitabine vein 4 hour day . On Days -3 -2 , receive melphalan vein 30 minute day . On Day -1 , receive study drug . On Day 0 , stem cell return body vein 30-60 minute . On Days 0 2 , receive palifermin vein 30 second day . Beginning Day +5 , receive filgrastim ( drug help growth white blood cell ) needle skin 1 time day blood cell level return normal . If tumor cell find CD20 protein , receive rituximab vein 4-8 hour Days 1 8 , standard treatment type tumor combine high-dose chemotherapy . Study Tests : While hospital , check side effect part standard care . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw every day check side effect . As part standard care , remain hospital 3-4 week transplantation . After release hospital , must remain Houston area monitor infection transplant side effect Day 30 . During time , return clinic 1 time week follow test procedure perform : - You ask feel side effect may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Around Day 30 , doctor think need , positron-emission tomography/CT ( PET/CT ) and/or CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . You lung function test 30-100 day transplant . Length Study : You take study 100 day transplant . You may take study early disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . You must talk study doctor want leave study early . It may life-threatening leave study begin receive study drug receive stem cell . End-of-Study Visit : At Day 100 , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - If doctor think need , ( PET/CT ) and/or CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy check status disease . This investigational study . Busulfan , gemcitabine , melphalan FDA approve commercially available treatment lymphoma several tumor . The use study drug together use gemcitabine dose level use study investigational .</detailed_description>
