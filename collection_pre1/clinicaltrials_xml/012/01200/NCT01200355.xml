	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect , good and/or bad , posaconazole micafungin prevent fungal infection chemotherapy acute leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome . When people take chemotherapy , likely get infection . Posaconazole approve prevention fungal infection patient receive induction chemotherapy acute leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome . Posaconazole available oral suspension give food . After chemotherapy , many patient able tolerate food oral medication severe mucositis . Patients unable tolerate food oral medication take posaconazole . Micafungin antifungal medication give intravenously . Micafungin approve treatment certain fungal infection prevent fungal infection patient receive bone marrow transplant . The investigator know micafungin safe . Micafungin test prevention fungal infection patient receive chemotherapy acute leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome . Because micafungin give vein , give even patient take food medication mouth chemotherapy . In study investigator want compare micafungin posaconazole give prevention fungal infection leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects great equal 18 year age either sex race . Disease definition : Anticipated document prolonged neutropenia ( ANC &lt; 500/mm3 [ 0.5x109/L ] ) baseline likely develop within 3 5 day last least 7 day due : Intensive induction chemotherapy new diagnosis acute myelogenous leukemia , acute lymphocytic leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome receive standard anthracycline base chemotherapy Reinduction acute myelogenous lymphocytic leukemia primary relapse Myelodysplastic syndrome require induction ( myelosuppressive ) chemotherapy Female subject childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test per MSKCC guideline . Able swallow oral medication Subjects history presume proven invasive fungal infection within 30 day randomization . Subjects take following : Drugs know interact posaconazole may lead lifethreatening side effect ( terfenadine , cisapride , ebastine entry within 24 hour entry , astemizole entry within 10 day entry ) ; b . Drugs know low serum concentration/efficacy posaconazole : cimetidine , rifampin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , rifabutin , barbiturate , isoniazid entry within 24 hour entry ; c. Subjects plan receive &gt; 2mg flat dose vinca alkaloid . Subjects history hypersensitivity idiosyncratic reaction azole agent . Subjects renal insufficiency ( estimate creatinine clearance le 20 mL/minute baseline likely require dialysis study ) . Subjects electrocardiogram prolonged QTc interval manual reading : QTc great 490 msec . Subjects moderate severe liver dysfunction baseline , define aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase level great 5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , total bilirubin level great 3 time ULN . Subjects undergoing reinduction chemotherapy participate study first induction chemotherapy . Subjects receive dasatinib .</criteria>
