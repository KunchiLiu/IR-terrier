	<brief_summary>This phase 3 randomize , active-controlled , open-label , multicenter study conduct approximately 120 investigational site worldwide . Subjects either recurrent refractory NMIBC ( Ta high grade , T1 low high grade , CIS ) eligible participation study . Refractory disease define evidence persistent high grade bladder cancer ( Ta HG , T1 , and/or CIS ) least 6 month start full induction course BCG without maintenance/re-treatment 3 month . Recurrent disease define reappearance disease achieve tumor-free status 6 month follow full induction course BCG without maintenance/re-treatment 3 month . Subjects recurrent disease must recur within 18 month follow last dose BCG . Approximately 450 subject randomize . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy intravesical EN3348 compare mitomycin C treatment subject recurrent refractory NMIBC . The secondary objective evaluate safety EN3348 compare mitomycin C treatment subject BCG recurrent refractory NMIBC . This study consist 4 phase : Screening , Induction , Maintenance Follow-Up conduct 3 year .</brief_summary>
