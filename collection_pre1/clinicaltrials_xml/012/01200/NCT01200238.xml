	<brief_summary>STA-9090 drug inactivates block work protein call Heat Shock Protein 90 HSP90 . HSP90 protein help molecule inside cell right shape . By stop 's activity , molecule never get right structure functional destroyed . We believe stop activity HSP90 , rapidly divide cell tumor ( ) slow since protein functional without help HSP90 .</brief_summary>
