	<brief_title>Effect Component Fish Oil Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction Airway Inflammation Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , fish oil supplementation study patient asthma use combination omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid . A study specific formula effective prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) yet conduct human . Nevertheless , show docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) metabolite , protectin D1 , involve active resolution airway inflammation concentration great healthy control subject ' exhale breath condensate compare patient asthma clinical exacerbation . Supplementing asthmatic DHA could enable increased availability protectin D1 help resolve airway inflammation asthma attack . Furthermore , DHA know support healthy cardiovascular system , maintain brain function , reduce depression addition alleviate inflammatory disease . Thus , pure DHA supplementation could help patient manage asthma provide overall health . The main aim study determine whether pure DHA attenuate EIB airway inflammation adult asthma . It hypothesize DHA supplementation diminish EIB airway inflammation compare placebo .</detailed_description>
