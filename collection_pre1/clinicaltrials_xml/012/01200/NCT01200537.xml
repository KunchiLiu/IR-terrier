	<detailed_description>1 . Protocol Title : Optimizing ovulation induction poor responder : randomize control trial luteal phase estradiol verse combine oral contraceptive pill ( COCP ) ovarian morphology biomarkers prior ovulation induction 2 . Purpose Study : In woman undergo ovulation induction high risk poor response , hypothesize : Null Hypothesis : Mean follicular diameter coefficient variation follicles patient receive luteal COCP statistically equal follicular diameter coefficient variation follicle patient receive estradiol . To test hypothesis , specific aim present proposal : Aim 1 : Compare effect luteal estradiol COCP pretreatment follicle synchrony . Mean follicular diameter coefficient variation follicle measurement calculated cycle day 3 cycle treatment . Aim 2 : Compare effect luteal estradiol COCP pretreatment follicle recruitment . Markers follicle recruitment measured cycle day 3 treatment cycle . Previously identify follicle recruitment marker positively correlate follicle recruitment include : antral follicle count ( AFC ) , AMH androstenedione . Aim 3 : Compare efficacy luteal estradiol COCP . The number mature follicles great equal 14 mm day hCG pregnancy outcomes record . The two treatment group : - Group 1 : Luteal estradiol administration prior ovulation induction management per patient 's primary physician . - Group 2 : COCP administration one month prior ovulation induction management per patient 's primary physician . Upon completion , compare follicular biochemical ovarian response luteal estradiol COCPs poor responder undergo ovulation induction . The future implication study development clinical strategy treat patient high risk poor response . 3 . Background &amp; Significance : Ten percent United States population , 6.2 million woman partner , report infertility 1995 National Survey Family Growth . The number couple affect infertility predict increase 6.5 million year 2025 . ' Among woman seek infertility treatment , subset classified poor responder due poor ovarian response treatment . Though definition poor response treatment standardize , study estimate 4-26 % patient undergoing treatment affected.2 The proportion woman classify poor responder may increase woman delay fertility age decrease fecundity due decline ovarian reserve . Establishing effective treatment poor responder therefore imperative . The principal goal ovulation induction infertile patient regular menstrual cycle achieve two three mature synchronous follicle maximize chance pregnancy minimize risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome . Poor responder , definition , low likelihood sufficient follicular recruitment . Lesser recruitment compound follicular dysynchrony necessitates human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) administration base large follicle lag small follicle less likely mature . Follicular dysynchrony compound rise follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) luteal phase . Fanchin et al demonstrated luteal estradiol administration suppresses luteal FSH rise , reduce antral follicle size , synchronize follicular cohort.3,4,5,6 Luteal estradiol GnRH antagonist administration prior control ovarian hyperstimulation vitro fertilization ( IVF ) show decrease cancellation rate , increase mean number oocytes retrieve , improve fertilization rate poor responder ( retrospective study use historic control present abstract form ) .7 Estradiol also use patient hypergonadotrophic amenorrhea suppress elevate endogenous LH FSH prior stimulation exogenous gonadotropin modest success achieve ovulation , rare case , pregnancy.8 Combined oral contraceptive pill ( COCPs ) administer prior ovulation induction IVF increase number oocytes retrieved suppress cyst formation.9,10,11 In small study poor responder undergo control ovarian hyperstimulation IVF , pretreatment COCPs associate increased pregnancy rate compare pretreatment luteal phase gonadotropin release hormone agonist ( GnRH-a ) , follicular phase GnRH-a , pretreatment.12 COCPs prior ovulation induction microdoses GnRHa gonadotropin enhance ovarian responsiveness poor responder result high peak estradiol ( E2 ) level , mature follicle , large number retrieve oocyte compare traditional luteal GnRH-a downregulation follow gonadotropin stimulation.13 Follicular GnRH-a administration release endogenous gonadotropin produce gonadotropin `` flare '' effect . Smaller , frequent `` microdosing '' GnRH-a minimize endogenous FSH suppression prevent premature luteinizing hormone ( LH ) surge . Oral contraceptive pretreatment prevents formation corpus luteum could produce progesterone prematurely flare . This protocol addition growth hormone ( GH ) show produce 50 % ongoing pregnancy rate ( PR ) use patient prior ovulation induction cycle use luteal phase GnRH-a suppression follow exogenous gonadotropin GH cancel due poor response.14 While COCPs luteal estradiol suppress luteal rise FSH synchronize follicle , compare . COCPs , progestin addition estrogen , may achieve good suppression luteal FSH estradiol result well synchronization follicle . COCPs , however , use decrease ovarian responsiveness patient polycystic ovarian syndrome increase risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.15 Therefore , COCPs may suppress ovarian responsiveness luteal estradiol , unwanted effect poor responder population . One potential mechanism great ovarian suppression COCPs may decrease androstenedione , marker show positively correlate total mature oocyte number obtain IVF , 16 subsequent COCP-induced increase sex hormone bind globulin . Previously identify follicle recruitment marker include antral follicle count ( AFC ) androstenedione positively correlate follicle recruitment.16 AFC reproducible predictor follicular recruitment show positively correlate number oocytes retrieve IVF pregnancy outcome.18,19 , 20 AFC measurement stable throughout ovarian cycle GnRH downregulation.21 AMH may serve biomarker follicle quantity quality since serum intrafollicular AMH positively correlate AFC number egg retrieve IVF.22 The mid-luteal AMH rise may reflect luteal follicle development ; 23 estradiol COCP may affect luteal follicle development therefore CD3 AMH level treatment great interest . AMH also exhibit superior cycle cycle reproducibility compare FSH , E2 , inhibin Band AFC.24 4 . Design &amp; Procedures : The study randomize control trial . Pretreatment Evaluation Baseline study precede ovulation induction : Cycle day 3 FSH , inhibin B , estradiol , androstenedione , AMH , AFC perform cycle OCP luteal pretreatment cycle ovulation induction .
