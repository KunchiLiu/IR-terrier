	<brief_summary>Background : - Essential tremor ( ET ) neurological disorder involve uncontrollable shaking , time interfere mobility affect routine aspect daily live . Several medication use treat ET , medication often partially effective side effect . About two-thirds ( 66 % ) people ET relief drinking alcohol , suggest alcohol affect part brain cause tremor . However , research need well understand effect alcohol area brain might important response . Objectives : - To study extent alcohol reduce tremor group patient essential tremor . - To use transcranial magnetic stimulation study effect alcohol essential tremor . Eligibility : - Individuals least 21 year age , diagnose essential tremor tremor hand , tolerate medication essential tremor 4 week . Design : - This study one screening visit ( 1 2 hour ) , follow one study visit ( 3 5 hour ) . Participants might ask also take part one additional study visit ( 3 5 hour ) . The maximum period study visit 3 month . - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood test . At visit , participant receive information safely taper current ET medication start study . - Participants must willing abstain drinking alcohol caffeine ( consume food caffeine chocolate ) least 2 day study visit . Participants must also fast overnight ( least 8 hour ) study visit . - At first study visit , participant receive single drink alcohol ( mixed noncaffeinated drink ) complete movement test determine whether alcohol improve tremor . Alcohol level monitor throughout visit . - At second study visit , participant electrocardiogram measure heart electrical activity determine able safely transcranial magnetic stimulation . Participants receive intravenous infusion alcohol complete questionnaire infusion provide information effect . Then , transcranial magnetic stimulation use study brain electrical activity , well muscle movement tremor activity , influence alcohol infusion . - After study visit , participant remain clinical center effect alcohol wear . Participants able resume take ET medication end study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ethanol Response Essential Tremor : Clinical Neurophysiological Correlates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The objective study investigate clinical electrophysiological correlate ethanol response suppress tremor amplitude patient essential tremor ( ET ) . STUDY POPULATION : 85 patient clinically diagnose ET accord publish diagnostic criterion enter study phase 1 . From group participant study phase 1 , 12 responder 12 non-responders invite back participate study phase 2 . DESIGN : In study phase 1 , response ethanol measure quantitative qualitative approach use Essential Tremor ( ET ) spiral analysis standardize oral ethanol challenge . The clinical response correlate breath-alcohol level . Participants study phase 1 select base rate response - dichotomize group responder vs. non-responders - study phase 2 , IV ethanol challenge , brain excitability test use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . OUTCOME MEASURES : As primary outcome parameter study phase 1 , determine patient respond ethanol tremor reduction versus patient without reduction tremor intensity , measure use spiral analysis dominant hand . Criterion response operationally define dichotomized fashion reduction tremor intensity , large know diurnal variation ET . Therefore , patient consider responder , spirographic tremor amplitude decrease 35 % time-point 60 minute oral ethanol administration , compare baseline . As secondary outcome parameter , spiral data non-dominant hand , well clinical rating scale breath alcohol level measure correlate objective subjective rating ethanol effect ET . In study phase two , change short intracortical inhibition ( SICI ) , know mediate GABAA , analyze use TMS compare responder non-responders constant iv administration ethanol . Secondary outcome parameter include measurement change GABAB-mediated paradigm long intracortical inhibition ( LICI ) , cortical silent period ( CSP ) , intracortical facilitation ( ICF ) , motor evoke potential recruitment curve well TMS-measures cerebellar inhibition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis essential tremor bilateral hand tremor predominant feature Unequivocal spirographic tremor hand screen examination Subjects must willing safely able comply study protocol therefore abstain medication treatment tremor period least 5 plasma halflives individual drug prior study participation . ( For Propranolol/Inderal , Gabapentin/Neurontin 1 day ; Primidone/Mysoline : 26 day ) . Subjects must willing refrain alcohol drink food contain caffeine start 48 hour prior study visit ( ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients significant pathological find neurological examination typical symptom ET Acute chronic severe medical condition would preclude subject participating ( e.g. , severe heart disease NYHA grade 3 4 , renal failure , hepatic failure , lung disease , uncontrolled hyperthyroidism ) Subjects active past alcohol abuse dependence Elevated liver function parameter ( AST , ALT , GGT ) , high 1.5 fold upper limit normal range ( define NIH Clinical Center Laboratory Medicine Department ) . The limit AST therefore 51 U/l , ALT 62 U/L , GGT 128 U/l . Female subject pregnant lactate Subjects age &lt; 21 year Subjects unable unwilling give inform consent Subjects unable unwilling cooperate study requirement Use prescription OTC medication interact ethanol influence brain excitability ( e.g . hypnotic , antiepileptic , antipsychotic medication , stimulant , antihistamine , muscle relaxant , etc. ) . Known flush symptom alcohol intake allergy alcohol . ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SUBJECTS ALSO PARTICIPATING IN PHASE 2 : History seizure disorder hearing loss Presence pacemaker , implant medical pump , metal plate metal object skull eye .</criteria>
