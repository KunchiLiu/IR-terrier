	<brief_summary>The purpose trial explore effect LY2127399 antibodies barrier kidney transplant . Transplantation currently definitive treatment End-Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) , provide prolonged survival improve quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , LY2127399 test potential treatment reduce blood protein patient End-Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) . These protein call alloantibody make body react proteins call HLA protein . When person antibody , refer HLA-presensitized . Often presence antibody , measure test call PRA ( panel reactive antibody ) , make person ineligible receive transplant - experience long wait time kidney transplant wait list . Therefore need reduce antibody significant successful treatment ESRD . This study treat ESRD patient 6 month LY2127399 measure PRA level total 18 month .</detailed_description>
