Baseline fMRI obtain index assessment prior initiate quetiapine XR therapy re-acquired final study visit 8 week ( time schedule visit ) . Ten demographically match healthy subject receive fMRI investigation two occasion order provide healthy baseline comparison permit interpretation patient finding ( e.g. , whether initial final fMRI measure patient abnormal control adaptation task may normally occur ) .</detailed_description>
