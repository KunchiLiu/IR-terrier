	<brief_title>Rasburicase Patients High Risk Tumor Lysis Syndrome ( TLS ) During Cycle-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : Rasburicase design help decrease prevent high level uric acid may occur begin chemotherapy . A high level uric acid result TLS lead kidney failure . Allopurinol design help block uric acid . It standard care help control increase uric acid level cause TLS . Study Groups Drug Administration : Each cycle last 3 week . If find eligible take part study , receive rasburicase vein 30 minute Day 1 Cycle 1 ( 4 hour begin receive chemotherapy ) . If doctor think need , may also receive drug Days 2-5 Cycle 1 . For Cycle 2 , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . There equal chance assign either group : - If Group A , receive rasburicase Day 1 Cycle 2 . If doctor think need , may also receive drug Days 2-5 Cycle 2 . - If Group B , receive allopurinol vein 30 minute day Days 1-5 Cycle 2 . Group B Participants : If uric acid blood level continue increase Cycle 2 show symptom tumor lysis syndrome , may receive rasburicase single dose . If doctor think need , may also receive 1 additional dose ( ) . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check uric acid level 4 hour receive rasburicase . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn antibody test . Antibodies proteins make body immune system use help prevent disease . On Days 2-5 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check uric acid level . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . At end cycle , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn antibody test . Length Study : You receive drug study 2 cycle . You take study intolerable side effect occur . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up : Three ( 3 ) month end Cycle 2 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn antibody test . This investigational study . Allopurinol commercially available FDA approve treat TLS . Rasburicase commercially available FDA approve treat TLS 1 cycle patient leukemia , lymphoma , solid tumor cancer receive anti-cancer therapy . It investigational give rasburicase 2 cycle . Up 55 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients high risk TLS potential/intermediate risk TLS describe : ( ) High risk : Hyperuricemia malignancy ( Uric acid level &gt; 7.5 ) ; diagnosis aggressive lymphoma/leukemia base Revised EuropeanAmerican Lymphoma ( REAL ) classification ; acute myeloid leukemia , CML blast crisis ; high grade myelodysplastic syndrome &gt; 10 % bone marrow blast involvement give aggressive treatment similar acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . ( b ) Potential risk : Diagnosis aggressive lymphoma/leukemia base ( REAL ) classification . Plus one follow criterion : lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) &gt; /= 2 x upper limit normal ( UNL ) ; Stage IIIIV disease ; Stage III disease least 1 lymph node/tumor &gt; 5 cm diameter . For patient potential/intermediate risk TLS Only plan receive alternating regimen ( nonstandard regimens ) 2 cycle ( example ; RHypercentral venous access device ( CVAD ) alternate MTX/ARAC ) eligible . 2 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 03 . 3 . Negative pregnancy test ( female child bear potential ) within &lt; /= 1 week rasburicase dose use efficient contraceptive method ( male female ) . Pregnancy test may perform serum ( HCG ) urine ( HCG ) . 4 . Signed write informed consent approve Institutional Review Board obtain prior study entry . 1 . Prior H/O severe allergy asthma require active treatment . 2 . Patients mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) stage 1 2 disease . 3 . Patient receive investigational drug hyperuricemia within 30 day plan first treatment rasburicase . 4 . Pregnancy lactation . 5 . Known history glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency . 6 . Known history hemolysis and/or methemoglobinemia . 7 . Previous therapy urate oxidase . 8 . Conditions unsuitable participation trial Investigator 's opinion . 9 . Unwillingness comply requirement protocol . 10 . Use allopurinol within 72 hour study entry .</criteria>
