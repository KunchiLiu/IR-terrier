	<brief_title>Genasense , Carboplatin , Paclitaxel ( GCP ) Combination Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : Oblimersen design stop body make protein make melanoma cell resistant chemotherapy drug . This may make carboplatin and/or paclitaxel effective . Carboplatin design interfere growth cancer cell stop cell division , may cause cell die . Paclitaxel design block cancer cell divide , may cause die . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive oblimersen vein 1 hour ( +/- 5 minute ) Days 1 , 3 , 5 21-day study `` cycle . '' You receive dexamethasone vein 30 minute receive oblimersen help prevent side effect . You take ibuprofen mouth 30 minute receive oblimersen . You receive paclitaxel vein 3 hour ( +/- 5 minute ) Day 3 cycle . You receive carboplatin vein 30 minute ( +/- 5 minute ) Day 3 cycle . Before receive drug , may receive drug help prevent side effect ( nausea , vomit , fever , and/or body ache ) . You may need receive drug time receive study drug . Your doctor tell drug , give , possible risk receive . Study Visits : Within 3 day cycle , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may . - Women able become pregnant routine urine pregnancy test do . Each week study , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Every 6 week , image ( CT and/or MRI ) scan screen check status disease . If doctor think need , bone scan . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment visit follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit : After stop receiving study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You ask side effect may . - You image ( CTand /or MRI ) scan screen check status disease . - Women able become pregnant routine urine pregnancy test do . Follow-up : Every 3 month 2 year stop receive study drug , call ask drug may receive . Each call last 3 minute . This investigational study . Carboplatin paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment variety cancer include breast , lung , ovarian cancer . Oblimersen FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
