	<brief_summary>This two-stage , multi-center , randomize , control , open-label study investigate pharmacokinetics , efficacy safety rituximab SC versus rituximab IV participants previously untreated follicular non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Participants randomize receive 375 milligram per meter square ( mg/m^2 ) rituximab IV infusion 1400 milligram ( mg ) rituximab SC . In addition , participant receive standard chemotherapy . Participants achieve complete partial response ( PR ) 8 treatment cycle , receive maintenance treatment maximum number 12 cycle . Maintenance treatment cycle repeat every 8 week . This two-stage study . Stage 1 design confirm choose rituximab SC dose result comparable rituximab serum Ctrough level compare rituximab IV , give part induction treatment every 3 week . Enrollment Stage 2 start rituximab SC dose establish Stage 1 . Stage 2 aim investigate efficacy safety rituximab SC compare rituximab IV . The anticipated time study treatment 96 week .</brief_summary>
