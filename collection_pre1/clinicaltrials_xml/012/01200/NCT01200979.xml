	<detailed_description>Traditionally , suggest pregnancy cause immunosuppressive state would facilitate fetal tolerance result increase susceptibility infection . Although suppression characterize global T-cell defect , observation increase susceptibility restrict specific intracellular bacteria virus consistent regulation certain component innate immune system . Progress treatment management infection pregnancy require understanding change immune system occur pregnancy . It hypothesize fundamental down-regulation innate immune system occur pregnancy remain delivery change serum cytokine influence na ( SqrRoot ) CD4 differentiation different subpopulation . To end , study evaluate blood sample draw pregnant woman early , mid , late pregnancy post-partum change innate immune system compare data similar cohort woman childbearing age exist database healthy , non-pregnant woman . Changes cytokine profile , gene expression microarray , lymphocyte natural killer ( NK ) cell population identify . We may perform neutrophil analysis . We evaluate toll-like receptor functionality , change PBMC throughout pregnancy . We also plan evaluate serum cytokine panel , PBMC flow cytometry , PBMC microarray gene expression , administration influenza vaccine 20 40 pregnant subject . Antibody level measure well . A comparison observe change make previously report vitro vivo study .</detailed_description>
