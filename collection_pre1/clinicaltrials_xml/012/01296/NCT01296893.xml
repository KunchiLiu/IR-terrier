	<brief_summary>Following chemotherapy , breast cancer survivor report alteration ability remember , concentrate , think , significant emotional , psychological , economic impact life . Survivors also report feel frustrate response medical community , either may acknowledge symptom treatment option suggest . Exercise may promise treatment , improvement cognitive function exercise demonstrate old adult clinical population . The investigator recruit woman complete chemotherapy breast cancer ( within past 2 year ) report cognitive change . Women randomly assign either 24-week aerobic exercise intervention delay exercise control ( offer exercise program follow study ) . At start end study investigator measure : ) performance four standard neuropsychological test measure work memory , learning , problem solving ; ii ) questionnaire cognitive function impact quality life ; iii ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) two standard neuropsychological test provide information brain working test . To knowledge investigator first study examine effect exercise intervention cognitive function breast cancer survivor . In addition , use fMRI image new way approach research question , may sensitive change traditional measure cognitive function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective 1 : Conduct randomize trial test effectiveness 24-week aerobic exercise intervention adult , female breast cancer survivor self-reported cognitive change follow chemotherapy . The investigator test follow hypothesis : 1 . A ) The exercise intervention improve performance neuropsychological test specific cognitive domain executive function , namely ) selective attention response inhibition , ii ) process speed mental flexibility , iii ) verbal memory learn exerciser ( EX ; n=15 ) versus delay exercise control ( CON ; n=15 ) . B ) The exercise intervention reduce self-reported cognitive dysfunction impact function quality life , EX compare CON , measure decrease score Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Cognition Scale ( FACT-Cog ) . Objective 2 : Conduct analysis effect intervention brain activation pattern use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . The investigator test follow hypothesis : 2 . A ) At baseline , brain activation pattern differ breast cancer survivor report cognitive difficulty follow chemotherapy compare breast cancer survivor receive chemotherapy ( serve breast cancer/no chemotherapy control ; enrol exercise intervention ) neuropsychological test complete scanner . B ) The exercise intervention result decrease region cortical activation , particularly region show high activation breast cancer survivor follow chemotherapy , compare change control .</detailed_description>
