	<brief_summary>Background : - Ferumoxytol approve iron replacement therapy agent potential use contrast agent image study lymph system , especially involve lymph node affect cancer . Ferumoxytol take normal lymph node , exclude cancerous lymph node tissue . Because Ferumoxytol yet approve use image agent , researcher interested test effectiveness contrast agent study normal lymph tissue cancer tissue lymph nodes individual prostate cancer . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness Ferumoxytol contrast agent individual schedule prostate removal surgery treat prostate cancer . Eligibility : - Men least 18 year age diagnose prostate cancer schedule surgery remove prostate surround lymph node . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , blood urine test , tumor image study . - Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan provide baseline image study . - Participants receive injection Ferumoxytol return another MRI scan follow day ( around 24 hour later ) . - Some participant may third MRI scan 48 hour initial injection Ferumoxytol . This third MRI scan optional require study . - Although scan followup portion study last day , participant consider enrolled study prostate removal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ferumoxytol Enhanced MRI Detection Lymph Node Involvement Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Prostate cancer common non-cutaneous malignancy among men Western world . Accurate lymph node stag important treatment planning prostate cancer . - Conventional imaging modality ( e.g . compute tomography [ CT ] magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) use evaluation lymph node involvement many cancer type , include prostate cancer , however diagnosis base node enlargement neither sensitive specific prostate cancer . - As consequence , standard care remove numerous lymph node prostatectomy ascertain lymph node status . - A prior imaging agent detect lymph node involvement , dextran coat ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particle ( USPIO ) , also know Ferumoxtran-10 ( Combidex , AMAG Pharmaceuticals , Inc. Lexington , MA , US ) show localize lymph node metastasis much great accuracy unenhanced MRI . Although large study lymph node image prostate cancer successfully conduct use ferumoxtran-10 , FDA Advisory Panel recommend broad use approval agent . - A derivative ferumoxtran-10 , Ferumoxytol ( Feraheme AMAG Pharmaceuticals , Inc. Lexington , MA , US ) approve iron replacement therapy . It semisynthetic carbohydrate coat , magnetic iron oxide preparation . This compound take normal lymph node , exclude malignant nodal tissue . A single study Ferumoxytol enhance MRI demonstrate efficacy agent 24 hour one dose use , MRI later time point perform . - Initial result NCI trial ( 11-C-0098 ) reveal use dose 7.5 mg/kg Fe safe yield homogenous accurate signal change benign lymph node comparison 4 6 mg/kg Fe dose . However , utility initial result could validate depiction signal change difference benign malignant lymph node prostate cancer metastasis . Primary Objective -To determine optimal dose Ferumoxytol enhance lymph node patient prostate cancer . Eligibility - Subject must male ( Bullet ) 18 year old . - Subject must document diagnosis prostate cancer . -- Those enrol lymph node involvement subgroup must image evidence lymph node involvement ( size great equal 1.5cm ) - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance score 0 2 . - Subjects must schedule undergo prostatectomy nodal dissection presume prostate cancer . Design : - Subjects prostate cancer schedule prostatectomy NIH Clinical Center undergo pre-injection , 24 , 48 ( optional ) hour post-Ferumoxytol injection MRI consist T1 weight ( W ) , T2W T2*W MRI 3 Tesla magnet . - In dose finding cohort , dose ( 4mg/kg Fe , 6mg/kg Fe , 7.5mg/kg Fe ) equal number patient ( estimate enrollment 5 evaluable patient group , make total 3x5=15 patient ) enrol sequentially . In lymph node involvement cohort , 5 evaluable subject enrol . - Subjects dose find cohort undergo clinically indicate prostatectomy , nodal dissection prostate cancer ; histology resect lymph node correlate image . - Subjects lymph node involvement cohort may schedule undergo prostatectomy nodal dissection core needle biopsy lymph node ( ) part clinical work-up histology resect biopsied lymph node correlate imaging .</detailed_description>
