	<brief_summary>A knee dislocation unusual extremely serious injury define complete displacement tibia respect femur , usually disruption 3 stabilize ligament . When knee dislocate , often significant damage soft-tissues envelope surround joint , include adjacent neurovascular structure . Not surprisingly , injury profoundly debilitating , life-altering event , potential necessitate career change athletes laborer alike . Current evidence indicate operative management injury effective return patient pre-morbid range motion ( ROM ) activity conservative management . Post operative rehabilitation program patient must balance need stability surgical repair knee ROM functionality . Experimental data suggest post-operative immobilization offer great protection surgical reconstruction , whereas immediate , aggressive physiotherapy may effective prevent arthrofibrosis stiffness . The investigator propose randomized clinical trial compare early physiotherapy ( day one post op ) versus immobilization three week initiation physiotherapy . The physiotherapy progams identicalbe aspect except progam initiation .</brief_summary>
