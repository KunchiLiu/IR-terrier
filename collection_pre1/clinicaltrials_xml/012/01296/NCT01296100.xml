	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) one fast grow public health problem develop develop country . The development T2D slow process involve genetic environmental effect . It commonly agree T2D may develop people carry genetic predisposition disease . Based epidemiological observation half people develop T2D lifetime , 30-35 % IGT . Therefore , likely half population carry gene predispose development T2D . In people genetically predispose disease , probability develop T2D high expose unhealthy lifestyle obesity , unbalanced diet physical inactivity . While change gene , way prevent T2D serious complication modification lifestyle risk factor . Therefore , important understand role preventive lifestyle intervention key treatment T2D prevention . Once establish , T2D difficult treat . Despite pharmacologic treatment blood glucose level trend increase time . Thus , efficient way manage T2D prevent diabetes develop . Also complications T2D best postpone postpone onset primary disease . The effort prevent disease need start early possible address susceptibility factor . Fortunately , recent study convincingly demonstrate prevention T2D possible . This project show first time lifestyle intervention work people IGT Caribbean population . The result study sued policy make plan primary prevention activity local health-care system entire Caribbean region .</detailed_description>
