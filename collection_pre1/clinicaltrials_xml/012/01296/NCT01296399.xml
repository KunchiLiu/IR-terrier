	<detailed_description>Intra-coronary stent deployment reduces rate angiographic restenosis clinically-driven repeat target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) compare percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) alone . Angiographic binary in-stent restenosis ( ISR ) usually define ≥50 percent diameter stenosis within previously deploy intra-coronary stent . in-stent restenosis often become clinically evident within first 6 12 month stent deploy . Although increase neointimal tissue subsequent reduction minimal luminal diameter ( MLD ) first six month stent deployment , may reduction luminal diameter , even regression , one year increase diameter later time point . Hence , one year recurrent ischemia likely due new progressive disease another site rather due ISR . Several risk factor predictor development ISR . These generally calcify clinical related factor , angiographic related factor procedural related factor : clinical relate factors- high rate ISR see female patient , hypertensive diabetic patient , patient suffer multivessel disease renal dysfunction stenting perform set acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . angiographic related factor -higher rate ISR see lesion type , small reference artery diameter , Smaller pretreatment MLD , long lesion length , complex lesion , ostial lesion , ISR companion lesion stenting multiple lesion bifurcation lesion treatment in-stent restenosis . procedural related factors- low rate ISR see high-pressure post-dilation high rate ISR see stent under-expansion , placement multiple stent , longer stent length ( &gt; 35 mm ) stented segment , Excessive stent length relation lesion length , Overlapping stent , small post-treatment MLD ( MLD stenting &lt; 3 mm ) , post-procedural percent diameter residual stenosis , use coil stent short time interval , prior angioplasty current stent implantation . The configuration stent may also affect ISR rate . Stents thinner strut thickness less likely demonstrate ISR . Contact allergy metal compound , particularly nickel , release stainless steel stent also suggest contribute development ISR . Drug elute stent ( DES ) demonstrate ability suppress in-stent neointimal hyperplasia , sustain effect last even two year time DES deployed . Multiple randomized trial , large registry meta-analyses demonstrate drug DES , compare bare metal stent ( BMS ) , markedly reduce incidence angiographic in-stent restenosis ( ISR ) , rate late lumen loss well rate target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) .Likely scenario , `` on-label '' `` label '' use , preference DES BMS , owe improve efficacy , include stenosis Left main coronary artery , leave main equivalent disease , stenosis ostial proximal leave anterior descend artery , large amount viable myocardium risk , need multi-vessel revascularization , long lesion , stenosis small diameter vessel , complex bifurcation lesion , restenotic lesion , saphenous vein graft stenosis chronic total occlusion ( CTO ) . In North America center , DES utilize preference BMS whenever feasible.However benefit DES ISR must weigh concern regard suggest increased risk late late stent thrombosis , especially dual antiplatelet therapy aspirin thienopyridine prematurely discontinue , catastrophic event often leading myocardial infarction death.Furthermore , long time period recommend dual antiplatelet treatment , deployment DES compare BMS , pose increase risk major bleeding . There increase use DES . In patient suffer ISR artery segment artery , DES often deploy de-novo stenotic lesion . However , difficult estimate extent ISR influence various predictor ISR . patient either clinical angiographic procedural relate risk factor , DES often deploy even case patency previously deploy BMS demonstrate . Therefore researcher seek investigate whether patient previously deploy BMS evidence ISR , so-called `` non-restenosers '' , significant difference rate ISR DES BMS deploy within de-novo stenotic lesion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient underwent coronary angiography subsequent angioplasty deployment bare metal stent within de novo stenotic lesion . The patient underwent second coronary procedure , six month first procedure , patency previously deploy bare metal stent demonstrate , provide intervention perform within stent six month interim . In lieu , either bare metal stent drug elute stent deploy within another stenotic lesion ( another de novo lesion ) . The patient underwent third coronary angiography procedure within 12 month interim second coronary procedure , instent restenosis demonstrate within stent deployed second procedure If instent restenosis demonstrate within stent , deploy second procedure within 12 month interim second procedure , patient underwent coronary angiography least 12 month second procedure patency bare metal stent drug elute stent determine Patients stent , either first second procedure deploy within previously stent treat stenotic lesion . Patients stent , either first second procedure , deploy within graft .
