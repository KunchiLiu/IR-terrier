	<brief_title>Aqueous Absorption Pharmacokinetics Besivance Versus VIGAMOX Patients Undergoing Phacoemulsification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study compare drug concentration aqueous humor follow ocular instillation Besivance VIGAMOX subject undergoing cataract surgery . The hypothesis study aggregate aqueous absorption Besivance six hour period great VIGAMOX unique property Besivance promote increase contact time antibiotic ocular surface . Subjects schedule cataract surgery screen pre-operative visit . Eligible subject randomize treatment Besivance VIGAMOX . Subjects self-administer 1 drop study drug operative eye 4 time day 3 day prior surgery.Subjects one final drop study medication day surgery.Immediately prior begin cataract surgery , sample aqueous humor collect paracentesis.Concentration Besivance VIGAMOX aqueous humor determine independent laboratory use standardize high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assay . Pharmacokinetic parameter determine aqueous humor concentration-time data minimally include area curve maximum concentration .</detailed_description>
