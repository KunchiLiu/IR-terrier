	<brief_summary>Liver-related death lead cause mortality HIV-infected individual CD4+ cell count 200 , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection great risk liver-related mortality HIV-positive patient . Compared HCV monoinfected individual , patient HIV HCV coinfection experience accelerate progression liver fibrosis , lead high incidence cirrhosis , end stage liver disease ( ESLD ) , death . Changes CD8+ T-cell activation , inflammatory cytokine , serum marker tissue injury may offer immunologic platform determine factor associate progressive liver fibrosis coinfected patient . In cross-sectional study evaluate whether HIV HCV coinfection patient well-controlled HIV infection undetectable viral load exhibit abnormal level inflammation immune activation , potentially contribute advanced liver fibrosis . Comparative group include coinfected patient successfully treat hepatitis C , absence hepatitis C viremia spontaneous clearance , hepatitis C monoinfected patient , HIV-positive patient well-controlled HIV infection without hepatitis C. Liver fibrosis measure non-invasive method . The primary objective study : 1 . To determine difference marker inflammation immune activation subset patient HIV , hepatitis C , HIV hepatitis C coinfection . 2 . To assess stage liver fibrosis use non-invasive method subset patient hepatitis C HIV hepatitis C coinfection compare degree liver fibrosis level inflammation immune activation .</brief_summary>
