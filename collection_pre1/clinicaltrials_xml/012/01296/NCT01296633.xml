	<brief_summary>The broad goal project improve knowledge adherence medication regimens health outcome among adult type 2 diabetes metabolic disorder . These patient complex self-care need , limited literacy cognitive skill meet need . Medication error widespread costly , often associate inadequate patient knowledge medication , especially among chronically ill adult limit health literacy . Inadequate knowledge often trace limited communication provider , part barrier limit patient contact time communication training , lack system-level support consistent use patient-centered strategy . There need leverage information technology ( IT ) provide system-based support patient-centered communication . The investigator evaluate Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) -based tool ( Medtable ) support provider/patient communication improve medication knowledge , adherence , health outcome among chronically ill adult complex medication regimen . A paper-based Medtable find help older adult create accurate medication schedule simulate patient/provider communication task ( Morrow et al. , 2008 ) . Benefits patient enhance Medtable integrated EMR , give provider ready access relevant background information current medication list patient update , provider generate tailor Medtable diverse set patient . This system provide integrated approach patient education medication , prescribe counsel office visit . As result , patient would understand take medication , develop concrete plan . Specific aim project : 1 ) Refine Medtable prototype use EMR environment . This include develop protocol generate patient-specific Medtables educate provider use medical encounter . 2 ) Evaluate Medtable 's impact patient care process outcomes . The investigator test follow hypothesis communication process : H1 ) Patients intervention condition satisfy communication medication patient usual care condition . The investigator also test follow hypothesis patient outcome : Compared usual care patient , patient receive Medtable intervention : H2 ) know medication ; H3 ) adhere accurately medication regimen ; H4 ) likely blood glucose ( glycosylated hemoglobin , HbA1c ) level target range . Aim 1 accomplish interview physician patient system refine ensure ease use system , collect preliminary evidence Medtable improve patient/provider communication . After establish initial feasibility ensure provider acceptance system , Aim 2 address randomize trial general internal medicine clinic Chicago Peoria ( IL ) , compare patient use Medtable provider receive usual care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medtable : An Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) Strategy Promote Patient Medication Understanding Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator integrate paper-based Medtable electronic medical record ( EMR ) system two research site evaluate whether EMR-based tool improves patient/provider communication , patient ' medication knowledge , health outcome . The EMR produce Medtables summarize patient ' complex medication schedule simple , direct language . The Medtable use interactively providers patient complex self-care need order create patient-specific adherence plan . Thus , EMR-based Medtable help integrate patient-centered communication practice prescribe counsel phase medication use process . The Medtable use nurse part medication reconciliation counsel general internal medicine clinic Chicago Peoria provide routine care outpatient complex health care need . The researcher seek investigate adult take complex medication regimens treat chronic illness struggle self-care ( patient diabetes metabolic disorder glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) level higher 7.0 ) . Patients vary age , education , literacy/cognitive ability recruit order explore whether Medtable especially benefit low health literacy , reduce literacy-related difference medication knowledge , adherence , outcomes . In Phase I , investigator develop EMR-based Medtable ( Year 1 ) . To collect initial feasibility data , Medtable integrate EMR-supported practice several physician general internal medicine clinic serve diverse patient population Northwestern Medical Foundation ( Chicago ) OSF Medical Group ( Peoria ) . Both site use Epic EMR system ( Epic Systems Corp , Verona , WI ) . Through interview questionnaire researcher assess ease use Medtable part routine clinical practice . Preliminary data physician adoption ( e.g. , frequency generate Medtables patient ) collect . Patients physician interview ease use Medtable whether improves satisfaction patient/provider communication , knowledge , ability take medication . Medtable interface protocol iteratively refine response provider patient feedback . In Phase II , researcher use randomize trial evaluate efficacy EMR-based Medtable provider/patient collaboration tool improve patient knowledge outcome ( Years 2-3 ) . The researcher use random process assign patient clinic site Medtable intervention usual care condition . For intervention , Medtable integrate routine patient activity office visit : ) intake , intervention nurse generate Medtable via EMR reconcile medication list work patient ; b ) end visit , nurse patient use Medtable develop easy understand implement patient-specific plan take medication . Patients take home hardcopy Medtable-based schedule guide adherence , electronic copy integrate patient EMR . Outcome measure ( intervention usual care patient ) medication knowledge ( immediately , 3 , 6 month Medtable intervention introduce ) , adherence ( baseline , 3 6 month ) , HbA1c level ( baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month ) . Finally , data Medtable use collect , include frequency generate Medtable patient visit , time require generate use Medtable routine office visit .</detailed_description>
