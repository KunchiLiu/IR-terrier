	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis advance solid tumor malignancy responsive standard therapy effective therapy . Expansion Cohort Phase : Histologically cytologically confirm recurrent serous clear cell epithelial ovarian adenocarcinoma , fallopian tube carcinoma , primary peritoneal carcinoma available curative standard therapy , investigator 's opinion . Eastern Cooperative Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status score 0 1 . Life expectancy least 12 week . Ability swallow retain oral medication . Adequate organ system function . Male patient willing use adequate contraceptive measure . Female patient childbearing potential , female patient childbearing potential agree use adequate contraceptive measure negative serum urine pregnancy test within 24 hour prior initial trial treatment . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . Expansion Cohort Phase : Patients serous histology must CA 125 level ≥ 2x ULN within 14 day prior start X82 . Patients elevate CA 125 level baseline require measurable disease RECIST criterion . Patients clear cell histology elevate CA 125 level must measurable disease . Patients must ≥ 18 year age . Patients enter study must willing provide tissue previous tumor biopsy ( available ) correlative testing . If tissue available , patient still eligible enrollment study . For expansion cohort , patient also request , require , undergo pretreatment biopsy . Willingness ability comply trial followup procedure . Ability understand nature trial give write informed consent . Patients currently receive cancer therapy ( i.e. , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy [ exception LHRH agonists prostate cancer ] , surgery and/or tumor embolization ) . Use investigational drug within 21 day 5 halflives ( whichever short ) prior first dose X82 . A minimum 10 day termination investigational drug administration X82 require . In addition , drugrelated toxicity recover grade 1 less . Any major surgery , radiotherapy , immunotherapy within last 21 day ( limited palliative radiation allow ≥2 week ) . Chemotherapy regimens delay toxicity within last 4 week ( within last 6 week prior nitrosourea mitomycin C ) . Chemotherapy regimens give continuously weekly basis limit potential delayed toxicity within last 2 week . Patients know allergy delay hypersensitivity reaction drug chemically relate X82 ( sunitinib , sorafenib pazopanib ) active ingredient X82 . Concomitant use drug risk cause prolonged QTc and/or Torsades de Pointes . Concomitant use herbal medication ( i.e . St. John 's wort , Kava , ephedra ( huang ) , ginko biloba ) least 7 day prior first dose study drug throughout participation trial . Patients know CNS metastasis , unless metastasis treat stable patient require systemic steroid Treatment therapeutic dos coumarintype anticoagulant ( maximum daily dose 1mg allow port line patency permit ) . Low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) allow . Females pregnant breastfeeding . Presence active gastrointestinal ( GI ) disease condition interfere significantly absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion X82 . Decreased leave ventricular function study entry define LVEF &lt; 50 % either Echocardiogram MUGA scan . Patients previously experience myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral arterial bypass , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Class 3 4 ) , arterial thrombosis , cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemia , 60 day prior Day 1 Cycle 1 . Patients inadequately control hypertension ( define BP &gt; 150/100 ) without current antihypertensive medication . Patients history additional risk factor Torsades de Pointes ( e.g . familial long QT syndrome , heart failure , leave ventricular hypertrophy , slow heart rate ( &lt; 45 bpm ) . Patient QTcF interval ≥450 msec significant ECG abnormality determine investigator . A serious active infection time treatment , another serious underlie medical condition would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment . Psychological , familial , sociological , geographical condition permit compliance protocol . Concurrent condition investigator 's opinion would jeopardize compliance protocol Inability unwillingness comply study and/or followup procedure outline protocol Patients history intolerance , significant toxicity , VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( ) ( TKI ) . Patients enter expansion determination MTD limit previous treatment one antiVEGFR TKI</criteria>
