	<brief_summary>Abdominal Compartment Syndrome ( ASC ) define Intra Abdominal Hypertension ( IAH ) associate new organ failure . The occurrence syndrome well know infant . Preterm birth frequently associate gastrointestinal complication , particularly Necrotizing Enterocolitis . In pathology likely intra abdominal pressure ( IAP ) increase participate occurrence organ failure . Newborn , particular digestive malformation diaphragmatic hernia , gastroschisis , could suffer syndrome . It would interest make early diagnosis order optimize management child . This require reliable measurement method standard . Intravesical Pressure ( IVP ) reliable validate indirect method measure intra-abdominal pressure . In order measure IVP , bladder must contain minimum liquid . However , use inappropriate volume could give erroneous IAP reading . The optimal amount saline inject old child , determine pressure-volume curve study 1 ml/kg . In preterm term infant , volume appear extremely low ( e.g . 0 8cc take child 800 g ) . The question arise whether quantity sufficient obtain reliable reproducible measurement IVP preterm term .</brief_summary>
