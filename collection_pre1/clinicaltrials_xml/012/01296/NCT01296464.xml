	<brief_summary>The primary objective ass effect single dose two experimental levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone ( L/C/E ) treatment regimens versus standard L/C/E treatment regimen Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient end-of-dose motor fluctuation term duration motor response first morning dose levodopa . The secondary objective evaluate safety L/C/E treatment regimens patient PD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Different Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Treatment Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise , double-blind , 3-period crossover study compare effect single dose two L/C/E treatment regimen ( A B ) standard L/C/E treatment regimen ( Stalevo ) duration motor response PD patient wearing-off symptom first morning dose levodopa . The study consist screen visit , 3 treatment visit end-of-study visit . Within 14 day screen visit , patient receive single morning dose study drug ( either two L/C/E treatment regimen ) Stalevo . The order 3 treatment period randomise accord crossover design duration period 2 day , follow wash-out period ( 1-9 day ) patient individual standard PD treatment . Before study day , patient arrive study centre previous evening . The patient ' standard PD treatment discontinue late 22:00 continued completion motor part ( part III ) Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS III ) next day . After completion UPDRS III , patient return standard PD treatment . Duration study 2 7 week per patient , depend length screen wash-out period .</detailed_description>
