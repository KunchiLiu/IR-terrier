	<detailed_description>The scientific rationale support study summarise follow : effective antiviral T cell response mediate HCV viral control induce spontaneous resolution HCV primary infection . This observation strongly support case development T cell induction strategies potential therapy HCV . A hallmark persistent HCV infection , viral load high , weak narrowly focus HCV specific T cell response , whereas resolve infection undetectable viral load robust T cell response detect . Furthermore , mouse human model persistent viral infection show antigen load crucially determine quality quantity anti-viral T cell response generate [ 17-18 ] . This support case assessment efficacy T cell induction , ) set low viral load follow viral suppression combination therapy , b ) set high viral load . Since pre-existing anti-vector immunity adenoviral vector may limit vaccine efficacy , conduct phase-I clinical trial healthy human subject use human ( Ad6 ) simian ( AdCh3 ) adenoviral vector find low sero-prevalence human population , heterologous prime/boost regimen ( study HCV001 ) . The vector also investigation HCV infect patient ( HCV002 ) . These vector encode HCV non-structural protein genetically inactivate polymerase gene ( NSmut ) . We show vector safe highly immunogenic . In preclinical primate study use identical vector , heterologous boost increased peak response long-term immunity . However , human appear , although HCV specific T-cell response increase follow boosting , magnitude response reduce compare observed vaccine priming . This probably due induction cross-reactive immunity two vector . In contrast , recently show Modified Vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) encode malaria antigen ME-TRAP successfully boost T-cell response prim simian Adenovirus vector , induce high level CD4+ CD8+ T-cell response ever observe use vectored vaccine afford protection malaria infection ( A. Hill unpublished data ) . For reason wish ass MVA construct encode HCV NS combine AdCh3NSmut ( AdCh3NSmut1 ) heterologous prime/boost vaccination regimen assess safety immunogenicity strategy healthy HCV infect patient . This study address follow question : In healthy volunteer : 1 . Can vaccination MVA-NSmut vector alone safely induce HCV specific T cell response ? 2 . Can vaccination use heterologous prime/boost vaccination schedule AdCh3NSmut MVA-NSmut safely induce HCV specific T cell response ? In HCV infect patient heterologous prime/boost vaccination schedule use AdCh3NSmut MVA-NSmut : 3 . Safely induce HCV specific T cell responses pegylated-interferon ribavirin ( combination ) therapy HCV genotype-1 infection , significant decline viral load , 14 week therapy ? 4 . Safely induce HCV specific T cell response combination therapy HCV genotype-1 infection , 2 week therapy ? 5 . Safely induce HCV specific T cell responses patient chronic HCV ( receive combination therapy ) high viral load ? 6 . Suppress viral load patient chronic HCV , treatment IFN Ribavirin ? Since effect combination therapy HCV specific T cell currently debate ( see ) compare T cell response generate therapeutic prime/boost vaccination schedule study , group match historical control patient treat combination therapy immunological assessment make identical way propose study .</detailed_description>
