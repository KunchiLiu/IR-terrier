	<detailed_description>The use tritherapy develop country start 1996 lead considerable reduction AIDS mortality due opportunistic infection AIDS-defining cancer . However , increase life expectancy accompany diversification cause death HIV-infected individual . In France 2000 2005 , non-AIDS-defining mortality rise 53 % 64 % : non-AIDS-defining cancer ( apart hepatocellular carcinoma ) high mortality rate , increase 11 % 17 % 2005 , follow liver disease ( 15 % 2005 ) , cardiovascular disease ( 8 % 2005 ) suicide ( 5 % ) . Among cancer-related death ( AIDS- non-AIDS-defining ) , proportion due non-AIDS-defining cancer ( apart hepatocellular carcinoma ) increase 38 % 50 % lung cancer ( LC ) account 65 % death . Many epidemiological study demonstrate elevated risk LC HIV-infected individual HIV-positive subject young diagnosis LC general population ( 45 versus 62 year ) . In recent study , adenocarcinoma comprise 70 % case . The prognosis LC bad HIV-positive individual . Some author suggest poor outcome may relate interaction additive toxicity cytotoxic antiretroviral drug . It also likely disease particularly aggressive . In general population PS 0 1 70 year age , bitherapy improve survival compare monotherapy . Survival high doublet comprise platin . Since HIV-positive subject LC tend young , logical offer best treatment demonstrate efficacy general population . In comparison cisplatin , carboplatin cause less vomiting , nephrotoxicity neurotoxicity . Survival slightly high cisplatin , come cost great toxicity . Carboplatin well tolerate subject PS=2 70 year age The HIV-positive population specific : - PS often alter subject young , call platin-based doublet . - HAART essential absorption compromise repeat vomit severe cisplatin . - Nephropathy occur 15-38 % case ; cause multifactorial include HIV virus antiretroviral drug ( Tenofovir® ) . - Peripheral neuropathy frequently relate HIV antiretroviral treatment ( especially didanosine stavudine ( 2010 YENI report ) ) . - Premature age see HIV-positive subject ; expose increase cardiovascular risk high frequency heart disease restrict hyper-hydration require use cisplatin . - In 2010 , virtually patient treat ambulatory basis whereas past would hospitalize . Carboplatin administer day hospital center , cisplatin . - It important preserve optimal quality life first line therapy patient whose life expectancy eligible second round therapy . Scagliotti publish phase III trial compare cisplatin plus pemetrexed cisplatin plus gemcitabine subject &lt; 70 year old advanced-stage NSCLC . Overall survival identical arm toxicity profile favor pemetrexed arm . The combination first-line carboplatin plus pemetrexed evaluated several phase II trial , particularly subject poor PS . In contrast taxanes vinorelbine , example , pemetrexed metabolize CYP450 , facilitate use combination protease inhibitor NNRTI , respectively inhibit induce CYP450 system . Ancillary study BIO-IFCT-1001 make . Since sample small , focus biomarkers associate multiple specific resistance platinum salt pemetrexed , particularly specifically find NSCLC nonsquamous histology . Similarly , biomarkers IFCT pathologist acquire expertise also favor . This expertise mainly involve , one hand , detect K-Ras mutation ( 15-25 % ADC ) RasSF1 methylation well TubIII expression immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) test mucosecretion PAS diastase-resistant staining , hand , evaluate ERCC1 and/or MSH2 expression thymidylate synthase ( TS ) expression IHC .</detailed_description>
