	<detailed_description>Introduction : Illicit use psychostimulant 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , `` ecstasy '' ) consider major public health issue . In Switzerland , proportion teenage MDMA user increase continuously recent year . According representative survey 2002 , approximately 3.3 % 15-16 year old student Switzerland take MDMA least . Compared correspond data 1994 ( 1.8 % ) 1998 ( 1.9 % ) , increase MDMA use among evident . In another survey Swiss Institute Prevention Alcoholism Drug Addiction ( SFA/ISPA ) 2.2 % anonymously interview subject 15 39 year report experience MDMA . Also worldwide , MDMA become one widely use illegal psychoactive drug , million regular user . Acute administration MDMA produce rapid marked release serotonin ( 5-HT ) via inhibition reversal 5-HT transporter . Since late 1980s , study non-human primate provide convince evidence high dos MDMA cause substantial sustain long-term neurotoxic loss exclusively 5-HT nerve terminal associate depletion 95 % 5-HT several brain region . In contrast , neurotransmitter system dopamine norepinephrine remain undamaged . Subsequently , two study MDMA user also show selective decrement cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) concentration 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid , marker 5-HT depletion . In contrast , CSF concentration homovanillic acid 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol , major metabolite dopamine norepinephrine , unchanged . Some image study serotonergic radioligands show reduced 5-HT transporter ( SERT ) densities cortical subcortical brain region MDMA user . Moreover , electrophysiological study also suggest alteration 5-HT system regular user MDMA . However , finding human strongly criticise methodological flaw ( e.g . small sample size lack specificity apply radioligands ) . Consequently , yet convince evidence selective serotonergic neurotoxicity MDMA human . Moreover , mechanism MDMA neurotoxicity animal still debate . In spite reservation , consistently show MDMA user display dose-related impairment verbal visual-spatial memory , impairment executive function decision-making cognition . So far , neuroanatomical basis neuropsychological deficit , relationship 5-HT depletion , remain unclear . On basis animal data , likely MDMA high cumulative dos damage 5-HT neuron human brain . However , multitude methodological problem limit number study conduct human subject , firm conclusion yet establish whether chronic MDMA exposure produce long lasting 5-HT deficiency syndrome , consequent neuropsychiatric risk . To address putative neurotoxicity MDMA human brain , propose , addition present receptor mapping study , novel functional assay serotonergic neurotransmission may useful clarify issue . Specifically , suggest 5-HT challenge study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) conjunction serotonin releaser dexfenfluramine [ ( + ) FEN ] may test functional integrity 5-HT system live human brain . Aims : To overcome impediment previous image study propose use direct approach ass integrity serotonergic function human brain . 5-HT2A receptor mapping PET [ 18F ] -altanserin , combination ( + ) FEN challenge , shall use investigate 5-HT release capacity current former user MDMA comparison drug-naïve control subject . We anticipate comparison change specific bind [ 18F ] -altanserin 5-HT2A receptor follow ( + ) FEN-induced 5-HT release reveal whether chronic abuse MDMA lead functional alteration human brain , MDMA user face increase risk develop chronic serotonin deficiency syndrome , possibly associate cognitive impairment depression anxiety . Our biological marker 5-HT function vivo shall enable u topographically map regional 5-HT release , hence determine hypothesize 5-HT depletion global focal consequence action ( + ) FEN . The putative functional consequence ( affect regulation , cognition , behaviour ) link region reduce 5-HT transmission . By investigate current former MDMA user , shall assess reversibility 5-HT depletion . Furthermore , ( + ) FEN challenge/PET image technique may reveal region increase 5-HT transmission due hyperinnervation 5-HT dendrite ( `` sprout '' ) , occur MDMA-treated primate . In course PET study , shall also measure cognitive ( e.g . attention , visual work memory , learn , executive function ) affective function ( e.g . anxiety , impulsivity ) , suspect alter due chronic MDMA use . Using correlational analysis , aim determine circumscribe region alter 5-HT function associate specific impairment cognitive and/or behavioural parameter . Current status project pilot data : The radiosynthesis tracer [ 18F ] -altanserin establish validate accord GMP guideline . The study use ( + ) FEN [ 18F ] -altanserin already approve local ethic committee , Swissmedic Swiss Federal Office Public Health ( BAG ) . Furthermore , 50 present former MDMA user 20 drug-naïve control subject screen , find meet general inclusion criterion . We apply method four healthy human volunteer prove concept . The PET scan metabolite correct normalised accord Logans graphical method . The region interest-based analysis do PMOD . We find apparent distribution volume ( DV ) [ 18F ] -altanserin strongly decrease brain region 11 15 % . Thus , propose method suitable investigate 5-HT release capacity human . Working hypothesis : We hypothesize ( + ) FEN-evoked 5-HT release discernibly alter availability 5-HT2A receptor [ 18F ] -altanserin , pattern reveal spatially heterogeneous vulnerability 5-HT innervation MDMA . We predict [ 18F ] -altanserin DV decline follow ( + ) FEN challenge lesser extent current MDMA user compare MDMA-naïve control subject . On basis animal data recent neuroimaging study human , hypothesize functional recovery former MDMA user manifest normalization overshoot serotonin release capacity . 5-HT neurotransmission homogeneously reduce chronic MDMA user , toxic effect evident frontal cortex subcortical structure caudate nucleus thalamus ; region innervate fine fiber arise dorsal raphe nucleus especially sensitive MDMA neurotoxicity non-human primate . Based result recent human study , furthermore anticipate dose-related impairment cognitive function , especially memory learning , well increased state anxiety current MDMA user , follow improvement cessation drug use , although recovery may incomplete . Finally , hypothesize degree impairment cognitive function correlate significantly measure reduction 5-HT function . Study design : To compare 5-HT neurotransmission current MDMA user , former MDMA user , MDMA-naïve control subject , 16 subject per group examine [ 18F ] -altanserin PET two condition . On two day - separate interval 7 day - subject receive , random order , placebo 60 mg ( + ) FEN . Two hour later subject position GE PET/CT head partially immobilize . Following acquisition low dose CT transmission scan , [ 18F ] -altanserin ( 250 MBq , high specific activity ) administer intravenously bolus 30 sec , dynamic PET data acquire 90 minute series 36 frame increase duration one minute ten minute . Subsequently , subject undergo series cognitive task Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery ( CANTAB ) . Moreover , potential affective reaction 5-HT release , anticipate group difference time course affective reaction assess repeat use psychometric questionnaire , specifically State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , Adjective Mood Rating Scale ( AMRS ) . At interval extend scan cognitive testing , venous blood sample collect assay ( + ) FEN , prolactin cortisol concentration standard clinical procedure . The neuroendocrine response correlate individual PET neuropsychological test result . Subjects screening procedure : Participants study recruit mean flyer distribute location associate `` techno '' `` rave '' scene Zurich , help local association involve drug prevention/information harm reduction . Experimental group match sex , age , cannabis use . Sixteen subject gender , age 18 35 , recruit follow three experimental group : 1 ) Current MDMA user ( self-estimated lifetime use ≥ 50 tablet `` Ecstasy '' , last intake date back within last 4 week ) , 2 ) former MDMA user ( self-estimated lifetime use ≥ 50 tablet , subject stop use Ecstasy least one year prior inclusion ) , 3 ) MDMA-naïve control subject . Health subject determine general medical examination include electrocardiogram standard laboratory parameter . To exclude subject current past psychiatric condition , subject assess diagnosed clinical psychologist use SKID-I . During recruitment , potential subject provide extensive background information regard administration ( + ) FEN , neuropsychological testing , PET measure , associate ( radiation ) risk , invite give write informed consent . Special liability cover hospital insurance subject participate project . Pregnancy exclusion criterion ; female potential test subject agree carry pregnancy test enter study . A detailed history psychoactive drug use , include type drug , first last use , estimate total use record . All subject agree abstain use psychoactive drug ( except nicotine cannabis ) least two week first PET scan . At begin two experimental day , urine sample collect screen presence psychoactive drug metabolite . Relevance project : Our methodology allow u quantitatively assess serotonergic function live human brain . The novel combination ( + ) FEN-induced release 5-HT intracellular storage vesicle subsequent PET assessment competitively alter [ 18F ] -altanserin bind postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor provide direct biological marker vivo serotonin function hitherto available . By apply new pharmacological challenge/PET neuroimaging approach group current former user MDMA , shall able gain important new insight debate functional consequence MDMA use , especially concern controversy reversibility 5-HT change follow cessation MDMA use . The topographic mapping regional 5-HT release follow ( + ) FEN challenge two group MDMA user drug-naïve cohort help assess contentious issue chronic MDMA user face risk develop global 5-HT deficiency syndrome , characterize cognitive affective change . Successful completion project useful implication public education harm reduction respect MDMA use , may also facilitate development possible treatment option chronic MDMA user .</detailed_description>
