	<brief_summary>Purpose : The propose 2-year investigation first double-blind , placebo-controlled trial examine hedonic response sweet taste ( HRST ) phenotypic predictor naltrexone ( NTX ) response alcohol dependence . HRST yield two primary phenotypesâ€”Sweet Likers ( SL ) Sweet Dislikers ( SDL ) . Based preliminary finding , HRST examine conjunction crave alcohol ass whether two factor together provide robust predictor NTX response . The identification method predict naltrexone response alcohol dependence important goal alcohol treatment research . Currently naltrexone use nearly much , part clinician believe effective . The development tool would identify patient likely robust response naltrexone lead increase use medication . This could help many patient opportunity try naltrexone . There two principal Specific Aims study : Specific Aim 1 . To test hypothesis combination SL/SDL status initial alcohol crave predict % abstinent day ( % ABST ) treatment naltrexone .
