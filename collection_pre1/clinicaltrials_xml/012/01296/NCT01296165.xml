	<brief_summary>It clear multi-resistant E. coli ( also know ESBL-producing ) recently become important cause infection patient live reside community . A risk factor analysis study perform 2004 2005 Calgary show consumption type food well water source significant risk factor community-associated infection due E. coli . However , significant unexpected risk factor among Calgary patient recent visit certain high-risk area Indian subcontinent ( India , Pakistan ) , Africa Middle East . Therefore possible international travel certain high-risk destination might play , part , role spread multi-resistant E. coli across different continent . This would happen via acquisition bacteria rectums return traveler organism would later cause infection . However , evidence spread infection due ESBL-producing E. coli associate international travel circumstantial best investigator would like prove indeed true . The basic idea study culture stool traveler ESBL-producing E. coli leave India , within seven day return Canada six month . The investigator establish traveler rectally colonize visit India bacteria still present six month return . A detailed questionnaire regard traveler 's itinerary behaviour India complete return Canada . The investigator compare itinerary behaviour colonize traveler non-colonized traveler identify certain high-risk behaviour place acquire ESBL-producing E. coli India . The investigator also determine colonize traveler later develop infection ESBL-producing E. coli acquire visit India .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title The importance international travel spread extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli . Principal investigator Johann DD Pitout , Professor , University Calgary , Department Pathology Laboratory Medicine , 9 , 3535 Research Road NW , Calgary , Alberta , Canada , T2L 2K8 . Tel : ( 403 ) 770 3338 . Fax : ( 403 ) 770 3347. johann.pitout @ cls.ab.ca Background rationale : The change epidemiology infection cause extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing bacteria Since 2000 Escherichia coli produce CTX-M enzyme emerge worldwide important cause community-onset urinary tract ( UTIs ) blood stream infection due extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) -producing bacteria . Studies different continent suggest sudden worldwide increase CTX-M-producing E. coli often due emergence clone name ST131 . It also seem foreign travel high-risk area Indian subcontinent ( India , Pakistan ) might play , part , role spread CTX-M-producing E. coli across different continent . However , evidence infection due ESBL-producing E. coli associate international travel circumstantial investigator would like prove indeed true . Hypothesis : Our primary hypothesis traveler visit India , risk acquire CTX-M-producing E. coli rectum ( i.e . high risk rectal colonization bacteria ) . The reason select India previous study Calgary show risk post-travel infection high traveler return country . The investigator also believe acquisition bacteria associate certain high-risk behavior travel India drinking water well , consume certain food product take antibiotic . Our secondary hypothesis traveler colonize CTX-M-producing E. coli return India , later develop infection ( likely UITs ) bacteria first present rectum . Objectives : To determine rate rectal acquisition ESBL-producing E. coli traveler India ( i.e . risk become colonize ) . To show ESBL-producing E. coli persist six month rectum traveler return Canada ( i.e . assess degree persistence ) . The investigator suspect clone ST131 likely present long period time ESBL-producing E. coli . To identify different behavior traveler India put high risk acquire ESBL-producing E. coli ( i.e . risk factor become colonize ) . To determine proportion colonize traveler later develop infection ESBL-producing E. coli acquire visit India ( i.e . risk infection ) . To characterize ESBL-producing E. coli identify clone ST131 among bacteria . Study design : The study perform two travel clinic Calgary London , Canada , respectively . These clinic provide comprehensive travel medicine service include preventative vaccination prescription anti-malaria drug . People older 18 year plan visit India period least 5 day , approach participate study . Informed consent obtain prior enrol subject . Travelers agree participate detailed travel itinerary stool specimen collect prior travel . Study participant request return travel clinic within 7 day return Canada complete detail questionnaire regard behavior visit . The complete questionnaire stool specimen obtain second visit . Travelers ask contact clinic develop infection next six month . Another stool specimen collect six-months return Canada . All stool specimen submit Calgary Laboratory Services frozen -20Â°C analysis . Specimens batch cultured use chromID-ESBL selection medium . All ESBL-producing E. coli isolate undergo phenotypic genotypic characterization include identification clone ST131 . Preliminary data : During July 2009 , 107 stool patient Calgary diarrhea ( without history recent travel ) 107 return traveler diarrhea , investigate presence ESBL-producing E. coli ; 5/107 ( 5 % ) patient without history recent travel CTX-M-producing E. coli stool 26/107 ( 24 % ) recent travel positive CTX-M-producing E. coli . ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . The majority CTX-Ms identify CTX-M-15 ; 2/5 E. coli non-travelers belong clone ST131 6/26 traveler belong clone ST131 . Statistical method : Analyses perform use Stata version 9.0 ( Stata Corp , College Station , TX ) . The proportion patient become positive determined . For analysis surround risk acquisition ( subsequent infection ) , comparison acquire ESBLs ( get infect ) , make . Differences proportion among categorical data assess use Fisher 's exact test pair-wise comparison . Student T-test Mann-Whitney U test use compare mean median . For statistical comparison p-value &lt; 0.05 deem represent statistical significance . Overall budget : The investigator would like perform study 1-year period hope enroll 250 - 300 traveler . The estimate cost US $ 250/patient ; overall study cost US $ 75000 .</detailed_description>
