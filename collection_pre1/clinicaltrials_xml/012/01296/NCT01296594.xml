A widely utilized technology may appropriate reinforce medication adherence cell phone , record process pill ingestion video function . As regular monitoring feedback important efficacy CM , patient provide daily message regard adherence CM earnings . In pilot study , propose randomize 40 hypertensive substance abuse patient suboptimal adherence antihypertensive medication one two 12-week treatment condition : ( 1 ) usual care , ( 2 ) usual care cell phone monitoring CM . In CM condition , patient carry cell phone record send time- date-stamped self videos medication ingestion . These patient receive congratulatory message reminder adherence , earn voucher time medication ingestion occur appropriate time , along bonus sustain adherence . We hypothesize CM condition improve self report pill count measurement medication adherence result decrease blood pressure .
