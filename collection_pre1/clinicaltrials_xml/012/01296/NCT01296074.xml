	<brief_title>Corticosteroid Prophylaxis Cardiopulmonary Bypass-Induced Systemic Inflammatory Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) common major complication cardiopulmonary bypass . `` Emergency Hematopoiesis '' pathological process induce inflammation . The investigator previously confirm emergency hematopoiesis induce cardiopulmonary bypass lead dynamic change quantity monocyte subset , significant increase number two monocyte subset : 1 ) CD14highCD16+ monocyte strong immunomodulatory activity ; 2 ) CD14lowCD16- monocyte potential ability proliferation differentiation . Therefore , new hypothesis risen : `` change function number monocyte subset induce emergency hematopoiesis play important role SIRS occurrence cardiopulmonary bypass , correct emergency hematopoiesis new breakthrough prevention treatment SIRS . '' To identify mechanism function change different monocyte subset pathogenesis SIRS , research intend target perioperative-period patient heart valve replacement , monitor dynamically number phenotype peripheral blood monocyte subset flow cytometry ; sort different monocyte subset cell culture vitro , observe ability proliferation differentiation effect monocyte subset T lymphocyte ; investigate mechanism immune function change antibody-blocking compartment culture patient ; observe impact glucocorticoid treatment emergency hematopoiesis , offer new object evaluation immune status patient provide new evidence anti-inflammatory therapy . Patients follow protocol cardiopulmonary bypass accord normal hospital routine practice . A total 30 patient enrol clinical trial .</detailed_description>
