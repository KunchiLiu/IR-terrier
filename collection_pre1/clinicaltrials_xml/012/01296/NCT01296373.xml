	<detailed_description>RESTORE study : Thailand prospective observational study HIV-1-infected patient either treatment naïve anti-retroviral therapy ≥12 month , CD4+ T cell count less equal 350 cells/µL deem treat physician commencement combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) expect reduce plasma HIV RNA ≥1log10 copies/mL necessary . The primary intent protocol prospectively establish cohort patient clinical data peripheral blood sample ( serum , plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) store substudies examine reconstitution immune system relationship disease outcome . Patients recently opportunistic infection ( OI ) also enrol . Investigators consider result ACTG A5164 ( 1 ) , SAPIT ( 2 ) , Makadzange colleague ( 3 ) study regard time cART introduction follow acute OI . This observational protocol stipulate time cART introduction , cART normally delay beyond 2 month diagnosis acute OI . Patients commence cART regimen determine treat physician . Patients observe pertinent clinical data record visit coincide standard care visit . The visit schedule year 1 follow : screening/baseline ( cART commence ) , week 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 48 . In year 2 3 visit every 6 month . In , opinion investigator , develop major clinical manifestation immune restoration disease ( IRD ) extra visit ( IRD baseline ) conduct . If patient first 12 week study follow-up , additional visit require . If , however , major IRD event occur week 12 visit year 1 year 2 3 , addition IRD baseline visit second additional visit conduct 4 week later . It likely extra visit would require management clinical disease . Details pertain cause , course treatment IRD event record . These include clinical data pathology result . Prior start cART study visit , extra blood sample take storage subsequent analysis . It envisage storage sample use subsequent exploration aspect immunity ( include limit pathogen specific immune response include pathogen load ; anti-HIV immunity ; pathogen specific ( ) clinical syndrome associate immune reconstitution ; B-cell response ) ; immune activation HIV viral dynamic . A sample genetic testing obtain baseline . The rationale determine host genetic polymorphism may predict immune reconstitution cART and/or predispose development IRD . Patients follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
