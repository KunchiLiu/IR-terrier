	<brief_summary>Advances biological characterization AML make proper estimate risk recurrence likelihood survival different group patient accord expression different disease parameter . Karyotype , molecular alteration affect gene FLT3 , NPM1 CEBPA , minimal residual disease flow cytometry response first induction cycle variable must take consideration plan treatment first line patient AML . This breakthrough field biology result yet development new drug really effective treatment AML . Therefore , core treatment continue rely use traditional chemotherapy combine allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell . Both treatment differ antileukemic efficacy , high aloTPH , well toxicity procedure-related mortality , increase also aloTPH . These aspect add candidate aloTPH patient lack HLA identical sibling donor force search alternative source hematopoietic stem cell donor . These transplant alternative , committed antileukemic efficacy , imply great toxicity . Therefore , ultimate effectiveness procedure depend largely proper selection candidate . While broad agreement term induction chemotherapy use combination cytarabine anthracycline , choice chemotherapy regimen controversial postremisión today . In poor prognosis involve LMA , patient classify `` favorable group '' acceptable disease-free survival consolidation scheme involve high-dose cytarabine . For patient appear inappropriate combine cytarabine anthracycline , least one cycle consolidation , raise option allogeneic different depend prognostic marker</brief_summary>
