	<brief_title>Panitumumab Gemcitabine Relapsed Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) remain leading cause gynecologic cancer mortality woman , 22,000 death per year United States alone . Due lack effective screening strategy subtle early symptom , eighty percent newly diagnose patient disease advanced . Despite cytoreductive surgery adjuvant paclitaxel-based platinum-based chemotherapy , 5-year survival rate continue less 40 % . For patient become resistant platinum compound ( define progressive disease platinum-based chemotherapy regimen ( refractory ) within 6 month complete platinum-based chemotherapy regimen ( resistant ) ) , outlook particularly poor , often herald multi-drug resistant disease . At present time , management ovarian cancer platinum refractory disease state limit palliative intent . Patients advance , bulky tumor , poor performance status nutritional compromise unlikely respond therapy may best serve supportive care . The clinical management refractory disease require patience persistence . A patient platinum refractory disease begin one agent activity evaluation response make every 6-8 week therapy . As long patient show sign disease progression , therapy continue unless unacceptable toxicity . When progressive disease observe , another list available agent use . It likely patient receive multiple single agent chronic phase illness . Every effort make balance disease response toxicity quality life . Based rational , trial conduct evaluate safety efficacy panitumumab , human antibody target EGF-R , Gemcitabine , treat woman recurrent platinum-refractory/resistant EOC . Our aim determine safety feasibility gemcitabine panitumumab therapy population complete , proceed efficacy study use expand cohort .</detailed_description>

Prior first line therapy platinum taxane base combination adjuvant therapy Measurable disease define RECIST criterion Voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw subject time without prejudice future medical care . Female subject either postmenopausal surgically sterilize willing use acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study . age &gt; 18 Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 Up three prior line cytotoxic therapy set recurrent disease . Estimated life expectancy least 3 month Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test Adequate hematopoietic function define : ANC ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Magnesium ≥ low limit normal Calcium ≥ low limit normal Adequate renal hepatic function define : Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) SGOT ≤ 3 time ULN Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤3xULN ( liver metastasis ≤5xULN ) Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 time ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL time ULN Creatinine clearance ≤ 50 mL/min Prior antiEGFr antibody therapy ( e.g. , cetuximab ) treatment small molecule EGFr inhibitor ( e.g. , gefitinib , erlotinib , lapatinib ) Prior treatment gemcitabine Radiotherapy ≤ 14 day prior enrollment . More three line systemic chemotherapy recurrent advance disease . Prior hormonal therapy allow . Prior immunotherapy , experimental approve proteins/antibodies Female subject pregnant breastfeeding . Patient receive investigational drug within 28 day enrollment Serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study . Prior treatment panitumumab Concurrent uncontrolled illness Ongoing active infection History active secondary cancer within last 5 year , except superficial basal cell skin cancer , curatively resect nonmelanoma skin cancer Psychiatric illness social situation would preclude study compliance . History know presence central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis Subjects require chronic use immunosuppressive agent ( e.g. , methotrexate , cyclosporine ) Clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , symptomatic congestive heart failure , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia ) &lt; 1 year randomization History interstitial lung disease e.g . pneumonitis pulmonary fibrosis evidence interstitial lung disease baseline chest CT scan Known positive test ( ) human immunodeficiency virus infection , hepatitis C virus , acute chronic active hepatitis B infection Major surgery within 28 day minor surgery within 14 day study enrollment</criteria>
