	<brief_summary>Primary Hypotheses : 1 . Among patient retain failed kidney transplant , continue immunosuppressant medication death patient discontinue drug 2 . Among patient retain failed kidney transplant , continue immunosuppressant medication hospitalization sepsis patient discontinue drug 3 . Among patient retain failed kidney transplant , continue immunosuppressant medication few rejection event patient discontinue drug Secondary Hypotheses : 1 . Patients undergo elective nephrectomy ( remove fail kidney transplant ) few death retain fail kidney transplant 2 . Patients undergo elective nephrectomy ( remove fail kidney transplant ) few hospitalization sepsis retain fail kidney transplant 3 . Among patient retain failed kidney transplant , continue immunosuppressant medication low level allosensitization ( anti-HLA antibody ) discontinue drug 4 . Patients undergo elective nephrectomy high level allosensitization ( anti-HLA antibody ) patient retain failed kidney transplant</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transplantation best treatment patient end stage kidney disease.1 However , despite development powerful immunosuppressant medication , transplantation still provide patient lifelong freedom dialysis . The half-life ( time 50 % failure ) decease donor kidney transplant 10.5 years.4 , 5 As number prevalent patient receive transplant decade ago increase , number patient fail transplant must either return dialysis undergo repeat transplantation also rapidly increasing.6 Repeat transplantation clearly best option patients.8 However , Canada , 10 % patient first transplant failure receive second transplant.9 Consequently transplant failure fifth lead individual cause dialysis initiation Canada.6 , 10 Survival transplant failure poor , 40 % mortality first 5 year initiation dialysis.9 , 11 , 12 In comparison , 5 year mortality de novo incident dialysis patient , include even transplant candidate , 50 % , 6 , 10while first transplant recipient &lt; 10 % .6 , 10 However , unique characteristic transplant failure population limit validity comparison chronic kidney disease patient . Transplant failure patient initially select undergo transplantation favorable age health status , thus differ unselected de novo incident dialysis patient . Similarly , unlike first time transplant recipient , transplant failure patient already prolonged exposure immunosuppressant medication increase risk cardiovascular disease , cancer metabolic bone disease . Notwithstanding issue , others publish number study document poor outcome , stress need prospective study unique subset chronic kidney disease patients.9 , 12-16 To date , study systematically examine patient population basic question manage fail kidney allograft remain . Although clear indication emergent surgical removal fail allograft ( nephrectomy ) , elective use nephrectomy highly variable poorly described.17-19 Acute immunologic injury ( rejection ) fail transplant occur long allograft remain situ , cause local systemic symptom . In addition , fail allograft may promote chronic inflammation lead malnutrition , anemia cardiovascular disease.20 , 21 No prospective study examine whether nephrectomy discontinuation immunosuppressant medication preferable retain fail allograft . If allograft retain , know whether risk continue exposure immunosuppressant medication outweigh risk acute rejection chronic inflammation drug discontinue . Importantly , management fail allograft impact allosensitization,22-24 primary determinant patient 's ability undergo repeat transplantation . This prospective observational study necessary first step define optimal management strategy unique grow patient population . The primary secondary research question determine association ( ) immunosuppressant drug use ( ii ) elective nephrectomy clinical outcome include death , sepsis , rejection . Importantly , study also determine association exposure allosensitization ( anti-HLA antibody ) . The information obtain inform design future interventional study definitively define best manage complex patient .</detailed_description>
