	<brief_summary>Background : - Studies show people develop post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) expose trauma military combat . They may repeat thought , image , dream trauma ; feel detached others ; difficulty sleep concentrate ; easily startle . Some study also show blow blast head , people may develop post-concussive syndrome ( PCS ) , may include symptom headache , difficulty concentrating , feel moody irritable . Researchers interested use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study combat veteran Operation Iraqi Freedom Operation Enduring Freedom order evaluate possible change brain may attribute PTSD PCS . Objectives : - To evaluate change brain function recent combat veteran may relate post-traumatic stress disorder post-concussive syndrome . Eligibility : - Combat veteran Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom enrol Walter Reed Army Medical Center protocol 351030 , return within last 6 week deployment Iraq Afghanistan last least 3 month , able magnetic resonance imaging scan . Design : - This study involve 1 4 outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center course 1 year . The second , third , fourth visit occur 3 , 6 , 12 month first visit . - At first visit , participant baseline MRI scan , follow functional MRI ( fMRI ) scan see part brain use perform simple task respond image . Participants complete questionnaire scan report experience MRI scan . - For remain three study visit , participant MRI fMRI scan complete additional questionnaire . Participation complete 12-month study visit , follow diagnosis PTSD , major depression , PCS time study . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) link functional impairment , poor outcome compare matched control people without brain dysfunction , great healthcare utilization . TBI diagnose point injury , post-concussive syndrome ( PCS ) PTSD diagnose initial exposure . Current treatment often ineffective , many affect military service member ( SMs ) never return active duty . Upon return deployment , many SMs experience initial honeymoon period symptom limited number scope , may follow sharp increase symptom within month . Identification independent predictor PTSD PCS upon return deployment could facilitate early intervention prevent disability . The main purpose protocol determine whether structural functional neuroimaging SMs ostensibly healthy upon return differentiate go persistent neurocognitive difficulty . Study population : The study population return SMs risk PCS PTSD . It involve prospective cohort study 128 healthy active duty military SMs , recruit Walter Reed National Military Medical Center ( WRNMMC ) National Capital Area military unit within 8 week return Iraq Afghanistan , serial evaluation identify develop PTSD PCS , well factor obtain time initial evaluation prove strongly associate subsequent PTSD PCS . A comprehensive baseline assessment perform WRNMMC protocol 351030 ( already approve Uniformed Services University Health Sciences [ USUHS ] WRNMMC ) , include demographic , neuropsychological assessment , genetic neuroendocrine assay , brain imaging synchronization , vestibular , olfactory , psychophysiologic measure . Neuroimaging fMRI activation task perform image protocol NIH . The study fund USUHS Center Neuroscience Regenerative Medicine ( CNRM ) NIH . See attached WRNMMC protocol 351030 . Design : Neuroimaging include structural functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , diffusion tension imaging ( DTI ) perform image protocol NIH . Follow-up visit 3 , 6 , 12 month allow repeat MRIs fMRI activation task . Data analysis include serial univariate multivariate analysis identify baseline measure ( include result image study NIH also result variety study perform WRNMMC ) strongly associate subsequent development PTSD PCS . Outcome measure : The primary outcome interest development neurocognitive difficulty ( PCS , PTSD , depression ) . Multivariate analyse assess baseline measure strongly associate outcome .</detailed_description>
