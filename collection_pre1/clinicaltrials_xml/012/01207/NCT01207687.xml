	<brief_summary>People neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) tumor grow auditory nerve cause hearing loss . These tumor call vestibular schwannomas ( VSs ) , acoustic neuroma . People NF2 also get schwannomas part body , well tumor call meningioma ependymomas . Because VSs cause hearing loss , many people NF2 treatment preserve hearing . This treatment usually involve surgery . Because surgery risk able help everyone VSs , method treatment explore . One area exploration look see drug take might prevent VSs grow large cause hearing loss brainstem compression . This study explore whether drug approve FDA currently use treat tumor might also work treat VSs . Based people take drug treat VSs already , reason think might helpful certain people NF2 . People enrol study receive drug one time every three week one year infusion . This study follow subject course year person take drug six month drug stop . This study recruit people NF2 currently symptoms tinnitus , dizziness , and/or hearing loss VSs . If NF2 currently symptoms cause VSs , may eligible participate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Symptomatic Vestibular Schwannoma Neurofibromatosis Type 2 ( NF2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective study determine activity bevacizumab treatment symptomatic vestibular schwannomas ( VS ) define progressive hearing loss patient neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) base objective hearing response . SECONDARY OJBECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability bevacizumab patient population every three week dose schedule 7.5mg/kg 12 month therapy . II . Assess rate radiographic response ( &gt; = 20 % reduction volume ) . III . Determine growth rate VS use volumetric MRI analysis comparison 1-dimensional 2-dimensional measurement . IV . Assess change function auditory system bevacizumab treatment . V. Assess vascular permeability ( Ktrans ) , relative cerebral blood volume/flow , mean transit time , mean vessel diameter perfusion-weighted MRI . VI . Assess change circulate endothelial cell , circulate progenitor cell , plasma angiogenic proteins subject receive bevacizumab treatment . VII . Observe impact bevacizumab non-VS tumor patient NF2 via whole body MRI . VIII . Explore hearing related QOL measure throughout treatment . IX . Explore effect treatment bevacizumab vestibular function ( evaluated NCI ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute every 3 week . Courses repeat every 6 week 48 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 6 month .</detailed_description>
