	<brief_summary>This pilot study propose examine effect Rozerem sleep/wake pattern among individual Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) experience sleep disturbance , use objective subjective measure . It also show improvement sleep/wake pattern result Rozerem impact daytime function use objective subjective measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Rozerem Sleep Among People With Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although research begin examine sleep quality within traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) population , study find research literature utilize subjective , self-report measure problematic term response accuracy use population know cognitive deficit ( Ba√±os , LaGory , Sawrie , Faught , Knowlton , Prasad , Kuzniecky Martin , 2004 ) . Because TBI often result diminish capacity self-reflective awareness , obtain reliable sleep-related information difficult survey alone ( Fleming , Strong , Ashton , 1996 ; Vanderploeg , Belanger , Duchnick , Curtiss , 2007 ) . A number study attempt objectify measurement sleep quality TBI rehabilitation nursing staff keep overnight log document whether patient asleep awake hourly interval ( Burke , Shah , Schneider , Ahangar , &amp; Al Aladai , 2004 ; Worthington &amp; Melia , 2006 ) . Because result one single observation point per hour , miss nuance sleep/wake cycle obtain continuous measurement throughout night still somewhat subjective dependent observer 's judgment . Polysomnography , electrophysiological measurement sleep , widely use clinical set diagnose sleep disorder . Using objective measure , Masel colleague ( 2001 ) find high prevalence posttraumatic hypersomnia , sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome periodic limb movement disorder identify self-report measure ( Masel , Scheibel , Kimbark , &amp; Kuna , 2001 ) . This illustrate limitation self-report questionnaire highlight need objective measure . However , high cost inconvenience polysomnography , require multiple electrode attach face , head , part body , make less practical research study . These limitation subjective self-report measure cost inconvenience polysomnography suggest need alternative method measurement . With use actigraph , small , highly sensitive , accelerometer ( motion detector ) worn wrist period day , number sleep-related variable derive analysis motion rest pattern use computer algorithm ( Coffield &amp; Tryon , 2004 ) . Variables sleep latency , total time asleep , number nocturnal awakening derive actigraphy comparable obtain via polysomnography , recent research study demonstrate validity actigraph-based sleep/wake estimate among individual acquire brain injury ( Muller , Czymmek , Thone-Otto , &amp; Von Cramon , 2006 ; Tweedy &amp; Trost , 2005 ; Schuiling , Rinkel , Walchenbach , &amp; de Weerd , 2005 ) . Thus , actigraphy represent mean measurement enable collection objective data comfort sleeper 's usual environment manner less invasive cost-effective polysomnography , reliable self-report measure alone . The widely research treatment sleep disturbance problematic individual TBI due effect cognition risk dependence . With high prevalence sleep/wake disorder find among individual TBI , Rozerem promise treatment option improve sleep quality less likely exacerbate cognitive sequela TBI less likely result dependence .</detailed_description>
