	<brief_summary>Approximately 60,000 premature infant born year weigh less 1,500 gram , many sustain brain damage prematurity . This study design evaluate long-term developmental effect one promise neuroprotective treatment , erythropoietin ( Epo ) , give neonatal period . Using detailed neurodevelopmental test state-of-the-art brain imaging , hope determine whether effective treatment prevent brain injury associate prematurity , lay groundwork study improve developmental outcome infant deliver prematurely .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Imaging Developmental Follow Infants Treated With Erythropoietin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over twelve percent infant bear less 1,500 gram ( VLBW ) sustain brain injury subsequent developmental delay . Although various neuroprotective strategy evaluate , none successful . One promise intervention use recombinant erythropoietin ( Epo , also know erythropoiesis stimulate agent , ESA ) . In addition stimulating red cell production , Epo show protective develop brain animal model . We preliminary data suggest efficacy use VLBW infant , risk require transfusion , also risk brain hemorrhage , hypoxicischemic brain injury , developmental delay . We currently perform multicentered study evaluate hematopoietic short term developmental effect ESAs preterm infant randomize receive Epo , Darbepoetin alfa ( longer act ESA ) , placebo/ control first 10 week age ( NCT00334737 ) . The first enrol infant reach 42-48 month January , 2010 . While study evaluate safety general short-term developmental effect ESAs , unprecedented opportunity study long term effect ESA significant detail , include evaluate long term developmental effect underlie mechanism neurologic improvement state art neuroimaging . This proposal seek evaluate longitudinal , long-term developmental effect underlie neurologic mechanism ESAs administer VLBW infant first 10 week life . Our specific hypothesis : 1 ) ESAs administer preterm infant neonatal period improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcome , 2 ) ESAs affect regional brain structure , neurochemistry neurologic organization reflect magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging , 3 ) blood level ESA correlate MR image neurodevelopmental outcome . To test hypothesis , neurodevelopmental outcome assess comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment two time point : 42-48 month , 66-72 month ( WPSSI III , Early Child Assessment , Executive Categorization Battery ) . Brain imaging perform concurrent developmental assessment include measure volume ( high resolution volumetric analysis ) , neurochemistry ( magnetic resonance spectroscopy ) regional cerebral blood flow ( arterial spin label ) . This study highly clinically relevant due long-term developmental image follow study part design , significantly increase ability determine developmental , functional anatomical difference exist infant randomize ESAs , relatively new interventional strategy use preterm infant . This proposal address long-term goal develop effective treatment strategy disorder associated prematurity improve understanding brain-behavioral relationship .</detailed_description>
