	<brief_title>Feasibility Using Depth-of-sedation Measuring Equipment ( BIS ) Guide Awake Fibreoptic Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part general anaesthetic , patient frequently breathe tube position trachea ( windpipe ) usually perform go sleep . For patient however , problem mouth neck may mean safe tube place asleep perform aid sedation . The level sedation vital . Patients must adequately sedated tolerate instrument airway yet time patient must oversedated fall asleep stop breathing . Assessments use clinical endpoint sedation subjective , vary observer patient prevent episodes undersedation oversedation . An objective measure sedation depth would facilitate safe awake intubation . Previous study demonstrate commercially available depth anaesthesia monitor use measure depth sedation . We wish find one monitor use help achieve right level sedation patient must awake intubation part anaesthetic . Depth sedation guide awake intubation describe previously . The current study would comprise two part . In first , measure sedation depth correlate clinical sign optimal sedation use propofol remifentanil cohort patient require awake intubation . In second part , titrate sedation cohort patient require awake intubation 25th-75th centile value obtain first part determine adequacy condition achieve . Patients likely require awake fibreoptic intubation identify attend preadmission assessment . Patients require certain surgical procedure , nature , high chance deem require awake intubation day admission . Such procedure , example , include ( limited ) revision surgery patient previously undergone Maxillofacial reconstructive surgery cervical spine neurosurgery unstable neck disease . These patient give write information explain go require awake intubation , may invite participate study . This write material thus available potential study participant period two four week prior admission . On day admission , patient anaesthetist decides require awake intubation suitable inclusion study approach one researcher offer opportunity enrol study . Informed consent obtain patient opportunity ask question study . Awake intubation associate specific advantage , disadvantage risk . Both group patient however receive awake intubation technique participate study . The first part study involve application noninvasive forehead electrode treatment patient would receive whether study participant . In second part study , participant sedate initially titration BIS value depth sedation evaluate usefulness measurement . If time , level sedation patient second group deem clinically inappropriate , situation modify accord clinical criterion . Since clinically guide sedation usual standard care , feel attachment BIS electrode difference usual treatment participant experience . The BIS depth anaesthesia monitor CE mark use safely 34 million patient worldwide . Reliance BIS measure depth anaesthesia exclusion clinical sign guarantee clinically appropriate anaesthesia caveat must apply 's use monitor sedation . In study , monitor adjustment sedation clinical sign apply time would occur without BIS monitoring . There risk associate use forehead electrode per se . Information render unidentifiable record information data collection sheet may identify patient . Data record spreadsheet , enter computer keep principle investigators.The data form keep locked cupboard . No identifiable patient information keep completion project participant identifiable publish result .</detailed_description>
