	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The present study aim : 1 . Compare effect 12-week integrated yoga therapy 12-week aerobic exercise program ( walk cycling ) cognitive function , brain structure function female psychosis patient . 2 . Compare change physical fitness , clinical symptom , body-perception , drug adherence , quality life , medicational side-effects . Descriptive data acquire study contribute well understanding research implication clinical application yoga aerobic exercise . SUBJECTS This single-blinded , randomize , prospective study use psychopathological assessment , self-rating scale image technique . In study , female psychosis patient recruit Early Assessment Service Young People Psychosis Program ( EASY ) Hong Kong , aim examine gender difference comparison study Pajonk et al . ( 2007 ) , select male subject . Ideally , patient take Benzodiazepine anti-depressants exclude influence drug cognitive test result hippocampal volume . If deem impractical completely exclude patient , subject least tried keep consistent antipsychotic dosage , permit 25 % change dose first 6 week commencement intervention . According data present previous study ( F. G. Pajonk et al. , 2010 ) , use statistical significant level 0.05 power 0.80 , calculate sample size cognitive assessment 96 ( 32 arm ) brain image sample require 48 ( 16 arm ) ( Noordzij et al. , 2010 ) . Considering drop-out rate around 30 % , aim recruit 120 patient ( 40 arm ) half ( 20 arm ) undergo MRI scan . PROCEDURES Subjects screen clinician outpatient unit Hong Kong . They ask sign consent form agree attend study . Afterwards , randomly divide respective intervention group . Each subject give subject number , correspond group assignment . There two session assessment . In first session , 120 subject assess investigator cognitive function , severity symptom , physical fitness , body-perception , drug adherence , quality life , medication side-effects . In second session , first 20 subject recruit group undergo structural MRI functional MRI ( rest ) scan baseline . Following 12-week intervention , subject repeat assessment MRI scan pre-intervention . Patients waitlist provide another 3-month yoga exercise course accord willing waiting period . All patient follow 18 month assess long-term effect intervention cognition symptom . For nature study , difficult keep patient blind group allocation , study hardly double-blinded trial single-blinded one . Two investigator yoga train aerobic exercise without know assessment result . Two research assistant well-trained recruited assessment , remain blind treatment allocation . INTERVENTION PROGRAMS Yoga therapy : The yoga therapy consist breathe control ( 10 minute ) , body posture ( 40-45 minute ) , relaxation ( 5 minute ) . The yoga therapy carry three time per week around 60 minute session . The yoga class operate size 5-10 participant accord general small-group size one instructor commercial yoga studio Hong Kong . The body posture use present study design cover body part give body overall strength stretch . Aerobic exercise : The aerobic exercise program include walk treadmill ( 15-20 minute ) , stationary cycling ( 25-30 minute ) , follow cool-down stretching afterwards ( 5 minute ) . The aerobic exercise program also take place three time per week around 45-55 minute session . The heart rate continuously monitor exercise portable recorder aim maintain heart rate range 50-60 % maximum VO2 value , yield exercise exertion level consider moderate intensity . The aerobic training session operate size 10 participant . Discontiuation : yoga aerobic exercise terminate subject report uncomfortable symptom lose interest continue . Discontinuation non-participation affect usual medical treatment care , receive clinical setting . MEASURES The primary outcome cognitive test ( memory attention ) . Severity symptom , physical fitness , image data secondary outcome . For patient drop study arrange additional assessment session withdrawal accord willingness participant . Data drop-out patient use final analysis intention-to-treat ( ITT ) method . All measurement take baseline , 12 week ( upon completion intervention program ) 18 month 120 subject . MRI carry baseline 12 week first 60 subject recruit . I. Cognitive Functioning 1 . Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( WAIS ) : The current study use Information sub-test Digit-Symbol-Coding sub-test . 2 . Hong Kong List Learning Test ( HKLLT ) : validate Chinese list-learning test ( Chan et al. , 2000 ) . It provide assessment process organizational strategy involve verbal learning . 3 . Digit Span Test : subtest Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised . ( Wechsler , 1981 ) It include digit-span forward ( DF ) digit-span backwards ( DB ) test . 3 . Letter Cancellation Test : subject ask cancel letter C E quickly possible . Time , number error omission item record ( Lezak , Howieson , &amp; Loring , 1995 ) . 4 . Stroop Color Word Test : Assessment cognitive flexibility , resistance interference outside stimulus , ability suppress prepotent verbal response . ( Stroop , 1935 ) 5 . Subjective Cognitive Impairment Scale ( SCIS ) : A 31-item self-reported questionnaire design assess subjective daily life cognitive impairment patient schizophrenia . II . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) The first 20 subject recruit group scan use 3T scanner ( Philips Achieva 3-Tesla Quasar ) . A T1-weighted , MPRAGE sequence ( TE=3.2ms , TR=7.5ms , flip angle=7° , FOV 240mm×240 mm ) 155 consecutive slice acquire sagittal view voxel size 1mm×1mm×1 mm . A T2*-weighted EPI sequence use functional magnetic resonance ( fMRI ) resting ( TR/TE=2000/32ms , 32 slice ) voxel size 3x3x4mm . III . Physical Fitness : 1 . VO2 max ( oxygen consumption ) : maximum capacity individual 's body transport utilize oxygen incremental exercise , reflect physical fitness individual . 2 . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) . 3 . Dual-energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) : ass body composition bone density pass low-level x-ray signal body . 4 . Sit-and-Reach test : common measure flexibility , specifically measure flexibility lower back hamstring muscle . 5 . Standing Balance Test : ask person stand one foot long possible . The test conduct person arm waist . Repeat test leg . 6 . Star Excursion Balance Test ( SEBT ) ( Olmsted , Carcia , Hertel , &amp; Shultz , 2002 ) : The SEBT perform subject standing center grid place floor , 8 line extend 45。 increment center grid . The subject ask maintain single-leg stance reach contralateral leg ( reach leg ) far possible along appropriate vector . The distance center grid touch point measure centimeter . IV . Clinical Assessment 1 . Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) . 2 . Calgary Depression Scale ( CDS ) . V. Quality Life The Short Form ( 36 ) Health Survey ( SF-36 ) . VI . Body-perception Drug adherence measure 1 . Figure Rating Scale ( FRS ) : seven male/female contour drawing , number `` 1 '' `` 7 '' , increase body size leave right . Subjects ask choose one figure draw accurately represent size body one represent desire figure . 2 . Cognitive Attitude towards Body Size : subject ask whether think : 1 ) underweight ; 2 ) normal weight ; 3 ) overweight . 3 . Compliance Rating Scale ( CRS ) : use assess medication adherence . 4 . Drug Attitude Inventory ( DAI-30 ) : assess subject ' attitude current medication taking . VII . Adverse event No current study report physical mental artifact yoga aerobic exercise . There inherent potential risk injury kind physical activity . All exercise , yoga aerobic exercise , increase progressive manner minimize risk . The adverse event antipsychotic assess UKU , new comprehensive rating scale psychotropic drug cross-sectional study side effect neuroleptic-treated patient . STATISTICS The Statistical Package Social Sciences version 17.0 ( SPSS 17.0 statistical package ) use data analysis . Primary outcome variable cognition ( Hong Kong List Learning Test ) , structural imaging data ( hippocampal cingulate cortex volume ) . A mixed effect model repeat measure use compare change cognition clinical symptom among three group . With mixed effect model , available data subject time point use ( R. Gueorguieva &amp; J. H. Krystal , 2004 ) . This strategy base assumption data miss random ( Ralitza Gueorguieva &amp; John H Krystal , 2004 ) .With unstructured covariance structure ( Joe et al. , 2009 ) , difference three intervention group time assess Group x Time interaction term . Primary outcome measure ( HKLLT , Digit Span test , Letter Cancellation test ) first analyze include three group . For analysis meet criterion statistical significance , follow-up , priori comparison active intervention group waitlist group carry strategy . All test base two-sided probability set significance level 0.05 . The Bonferroni correction procedure conduct adjust multiple comparison among groups.The effect size ( Cohen 's ) calculate well compare therapeutic effect yoga aerobic exercise among three group . Image processing analysis carry software package FSL4.1 , Freesurfer 5.1 SPM8 . The primary outcome structural MRI data change grey matter hippocampus prefrontal cortex . The primary outcome functional MRI data activity change prefrontal cortex cingulate cortex .</detailed_description>
