	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether milnacipran reduces widespread , non-joint pain patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The investigator conduct double-blind randomize crossover trial subject RA test hypothesis milnacipran improve widespread , non-joint pain . The investigator also use data trial determine whether response milnacipran associate pain-modulating mechanisms central nervous system . The investigator hypothesize response milnacipran great among patient impaired central pain mechanism among patient intact central pain modulate mechanism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Milnacipran Treatment Widespread , Non-Joint Pain Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite development effective medication treat inflammation , pain remain priority rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient . The pain persist despite anti-inflammatory treatment usually widespread non-articular ; may lead diminished quality life high medical , psychological social cost . To develop good treatment pain prevent disability , critical obtain good understand widespread , non-joint pain RA . Milnacipran selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI ) . No study examine effect SNRIs pain RA . However , several study examine role SNRIs fibromyalgia relate pain condition . Treatment milnacipran associate improvement clinical pain severity Phase 2 Phase 3 randomize placebo-controlled trial fibromyalgia patient . In animal model , milnacipran appear moderate pain-inducing effect inflammation central sensitization . Thus milnacipran may ideal drug treat pain RA . A clinical trial SNRI treatment widespread , non-joint pain RA provide information regard pain mechanism may lead target , effective way treat pain RA .</detailed_description>
