	<brief_summary>In comparative open-label cohort study , investigator compare efficacy safety tacrolimus ( TAC ) cyclophosphamide ( CYC ) treatment diffuse proliferative membranous lupus nephritis severe renal disease . Treatment lupus nephritis ( LN ) cyclophosphamide effective , retain certain proportion renal function exacerbation . Tacrolimus may suitable substitute treatment CYC . Methods : Forty patient diffuse proliferative membranous recruit trial , 45 % low Ccr ( &lt; 60mL/min/1.73m2 ) , 10 % increase serum creatinine ( &gt; 180µmol/L ) 67.5 % nephritic proteinuria ( &gt; 3.5g/day ) . The investigator compare efficacy adverse effect TAC ( 0.04-0.08 mg/kg/d ) prednisone 12 month ( TAC group ) pulse cyclophosphamide ( 750mg/m2 per month six month ) prednisone follow azathioprine ( 50mg/day）for 6 month ( CYC group ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tacrolimus Versus Cyclophosphamide Treatment Lupus Nephritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) multisystem autoimmune disease . About 60 % SLE patient renal disease , patient rapidly progressive destruction renal parenchyma significantly poor prognosis . Drug therapy employ corticosteroid , cyclophosphamide , and/or mycophenolate mofetil improve patient outcome , significant number patient refractory disease tolerate drug . Moreover , SLE patient partially responsive resistant treatment significant morbidity，mortality , exacerbation renal function . Thus , patient lupus nephritis ( LN ) , two main cause morbidity mortality treatment-related patient-related . It suggest new therapy develop SLE specifically target relevant immunopathogenetic pathway , achieve great efficacy reduce therapy-related toxicity ，and save protect renal function . Tacrolimus ( TAC ) immunosuppressive macrolide calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) group widely administer follow organ transplantation . In 1989 , Takabayashi K. et al . studied effect TAC murine model SLE , show prolonged lifespan , reduce proteinuria , prevent progression nephropathy , although appreciable effect level anti-dsDNA antibody . More recent small-scale study show TAC may effective treatment nephritic syndrome LN8-11 . However , little clinical experience use TAC treatment LN , especially LN severe renal disease , limited knowledge comparative efficacy TAC therapy . In comparative open-label cohort study , compare efficacy safety TAC CYC treatment diffuse proliferative membranous lupus nephritis severe renal disease . LN characterize autoantibody-mediated vasculitis may lead rapid progression multi-system organ damage . The kidney often involve due excretion excessive urinary protein and/or rapidly progressive kidney injury , end-stage renal disease may result . Treatment-related difference rate renal failure may discernible early course treatment , definite advantage rapid remission , effective prophylaxis relapse , prevention renal failure . An intravenous pulse CYC regime `` gold standard '' immunosuppressive regime treatment LN . The activation lymphocytes , production autoantibody , high expression IFN-γ circulation renal tissue important indicator renal injury SLE . Previous clinical animal study show TAC therapy inhibit T-lymphocyte activation , suppress cytokine production lymphocyte , suppress antigen-induced monokine ( TNF-α ) production macrophage , reduce interleukin-2 mRNA expression , decrease serum level IFN-γ IFN-γ mRNA expression kidney spleen , decrease serum level IgG-class anti-DNA antibody . A recent study also show TAC treatment affect B-cell antibody responses indirectly interfere T-helper cell . The risk end-stage renal failure particularly high patient diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis . Despite diverse complex interplay various causative factor individual patient , two previous study suggest SLE patient experience glomerulonephritis diminish follow treatment conventional immunosuppressive therapy increase risk subsequent deterioration renal function poor long-term outcome . This suggest urgent need alternative immunosuppressive therapy treatment SLE , motivate investigation TAC . On hand , well know calcineurin inhibitor ( TAC ) associate chronic nephrotoxicity . For example , Tse et al . show one six patient develop chronic nephrotoxicity 10 month TAC therapy . As calcineurin inhibitor , TAC low potential nephrotoxicity cyclosporine . Opportunistic infection severe complication result treatment LN immunosuppressive drug .</detailed_description>
