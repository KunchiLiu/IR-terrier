	<brief_summary>This study combine deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methyltransferase inhibitor , 5-azacitidine ( 5-AZA ) , orally bioavailable histone deacetylase inhibitor , entinostat ( SNDX-275 ) , adjuvant treatment patient resect stage I non-small cell lung cancer ( NCSLC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Entinostat Treating Patients With Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect 5-azacitidine entinostat hazard 3 year progression-free survival patient resect stage I non-small cell lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety , tolerability toxicity entinostat 5-azacitidine patient resect stage I non-small cell lung cancer . II . To explore effect entinostat 5-azacitidine median disease-free overall survival patient resect stage I non-small cell lung cancer . III . To assess pharmacodynamic effect 5-azacitidine entinostat DNA methylation gene re-expression patient resect stage I NSCLC analysis sputum . IV . To estimate effect entinostat 5-azacitidine progression free survival compare patient N2 lymph node categorize methylated pre-treatment categorized unmethylated . V. To establish factor predict clinical outcome patient treat combination epigenetic therapy perform genome-wide analysis pre-treatment tumor DNA . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-5 8-10 entinostat orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 3 10 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive standard care . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
