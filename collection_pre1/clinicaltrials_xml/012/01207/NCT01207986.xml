	<brief_title>Early Lung Cancer Diagnosis HIV Infected Population With Important Smoking History With Low Dose CT : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Epidemiological study France western world show lung cancer first cause mortality amongst non-AIDS classifying cancer HIV-infected individual , despite introduction combination antiretroviral therapy . Compared general population , increase risk lung cancer HIV-infected individual , even adjustment smoking age , estimate around 2.6 compare general population . Outcomes dismal , diagnose HIV-infected individual usually make advanced stage ( usually stage III IV ) without screen . Two non-randomized study CT-screening non HIV-infected population expose smoke show important rate early lung cancer detection high level survival 5 10 year . Despite probable high prevalence lung cancer HIV-infected population , lung cancer screen early diagnosis study realise , prevalence yet determine . We deduce different study non HIV-infected population 3 % prevalence HIV-infected population . Methods Prospective multicentric national study evaluate prevalence lung cancer low-dose CT 450 individual know HIV-infection , nadir level TCD4 cell &lt; 350/µl , ≥ 40 year old smoking history ≥ 20 pack year ( either active &lt; 3 year wean ) . CT interpretation lung biopsy guide suggest workup algorithm , impose HIV-caring centre . Inclusion follow period Inclusion period 9 month , follow , case discovery small nodule , CT follow scheme two year first diagnosis . The study close 26 month follow . Awaited result For first time , prospective study lung cancer estimate prevalence cancer screen HIV-infected population . Risks associate incidence cancer investigate , include potential immune factor . An increased number stage I non small cell lung cancer expect .</detailed_description>
