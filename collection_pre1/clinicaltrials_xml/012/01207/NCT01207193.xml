	<brief_summary>There two type bone cyst , unicameral aneurismal . These cyst happen anyone , commonly see child young adult bone still grow . Living bone cyst determine treatment option depend type cyst . Non-surgical treatment unicameral bone cysts involves repeat X-rays individual experience symptom . Surgical removal unicameral bone cyst need becomes especially painful , area bone start thin . The investigator aim assess clinical efficacy side effect mesenchymal stem cell seed bone matrix repair bone cyst .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Of Bone Cyst With Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone cyst benign lesion usually discover child age 5 15 year . Treatment option include observation , corticosteroid injection surgery . Sometimes risk surgery comparable likelihood fracture without treatment . In orthopedic surgery , bone chip , various type ceramic , natural synthetized bone mineral hydroxyapatite tricalcium phosphate , well numerous polymer co-polymers alfa-hydroxy acid use perform osteoconductive rarely osteoinductive factor help bone formation.Some evidence demonstrate bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell deposit surface construct enhance osteogenic differentiation . In study investigator seed culture bone marrow derive mesenchymal stem cell bone matrix , evaluate therapeutic potential repair unicameral aneurysmal bone cyst.This composite place bone cyst curettage surgery.Post-operation assessment do X-Ray examination MRI 1 , 2 , 6 , 12 month treatment .</detailed_description>
