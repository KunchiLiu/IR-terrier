	<brief_summary>Children developmental disability often sustain decreased range motion extremity . The decrease flexibility may due neuromuscular disorder spasticity dystonia . Other cause may imbalance muscle strength surround joint , lead inappropriate habitual posture . Over time , muscle contracture may result muscle group place shortened position extend period time . The common site muscle contracture among child gastrocnemius/soleus ( low limb ) , latissimus dorsi muscle ( upper limb ) . Muscle contractures lead decline functional ability . Therefore , important identify effective intervention strategy enhance maintain muscle flexibility child developmental dysfunction . Commercially available endermotherapy device use soften scar tissue follow burn injury . The mechanical stimulation apply may also beneficial effect relax muscle tissue . The overall aim propose study determine whether endermotherapy treatment immediate effect improve joint range motion among child developmental disability . The research hypothesis child endermotherapy group significantly gain ankle passive range motion control group .</brief_summary>
