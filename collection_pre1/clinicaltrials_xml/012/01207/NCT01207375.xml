	<detailed_description>Impairments high level cognitive processing , new learn memory , among common deficit individual Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) deficits show exert significant negative impact multiple aspect everyday life , include occupational social functioning . Despite finding , study attempt remediate cognitive deficit order improve everyday functioning individual TBI Therefore , conduct double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial , apply memory rehabilitation technique large sample TBI participant . This protocol well-validated neurological population preliminary evidence support use MS exist . Individuals TBI , document impairment memory new learning , randomly assign either memory retrain group placebo control group . Outcome measure two mechanism : ( 1 ) traditional neuropsychological ( NP ) battery ( 2 ) assessment global functioning ( AGF ) examine impact treatment daily activity . Both group undergo baseline , immediate follow-up , long-term follow-up assessment consist traditional NP evaluation , examines objective performance well-validated measure cognitive function , AGF , include self-report measure memory ability , self-efficacy , quality life , occupational functioning . In way , able objectively evaluate presence absence change memory performance NP assessment , also evaluate impact treatment protocol individual 's everyday life AGF . While study evaluate efficacy cognitive retrain usually employ pre-training post-training evaluation , evaluation criticize lack ecological validity . The present design allow assessment efficacy particular memory retrain technique within TBI population use traditional measure , well assessment impact rehabilitation technique everyday life . In addition , include 6-month follow-up assessment measure long-term impact treatment objective cognitive functioning , NP assessment , everyday life , AGF . Finally , half participant experimental group participate monthly `` booster session '' follow completion treatment evaluate impact session maintenance treatment effect time . A subset sample also complete pre post neuroimaging evaluate change cerebral activation . The documentation efficacy memory retrain TBI , particularly everyday functioning , could significant impact symptom management quality life live person . As , specific aim current research protocol follow . Aim 1 . This study objectively evaluate clinical utility memory retrain protocol improve performance objective test new learn memory large sample individual TBI document deficit area . Aim 2 . We increase generalizability real life application assessment technique assess outcome follow cognitive retrain global measure everyday life . An objective measure everyday functioning include , well numerous subjective measure everyday functioning , gather via establish self-report instrument , well rating significant . Aim 3 : This study evaluate long-term efficacy memory retrain protocol inclusion 6-month follow-up assessment . Many cognitive remediation study literature examine efficacy treatment immediately follow program completion . However , give time , expense , labor involve intensive treatment , important demonstrate long-term efficacy program . The current study therefore go beyond typical protocol length evaluate long-term impact treatment objective test individual 's daily life . Aim 4 : We examine need impact `` booster session '' follow completion treatment . `` Booster session '' show efficacious maximize long term benefit cognitive retrain research population . However , utility booster session TBI population never investigate .</detailed_description>
