	<brief_title>Oral Ketamine Adjuvant Opioids Pain Treatment Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate 10 % -15 % patient cancer-related pain achieve acceptable level pain relief even oral parenteral opioids skillfully combine conventional adjuvant analgesic intractable pain occur 2 % advanced cancer patient . Painful condition arise tumor-nerve structure involvement , neuropathic pain , skin lesion , iatrogenic ( chemo-and radiotherapy lesion ) , ischemic pain likely require aggressive treatment , use unconventional agent interventional management approach . Despite considerable progress technology cancer-related pain management increase broaden array medication , many patient fail achieve adequate pain relief . In others , availability treatment may limited factor side effect , lack pain-management expertise . Furthermore , development opioid tolerance high incidence side effect escalate dose opioid dose may contribute treatment failure . The need develop new pharmacologic approach refractory pain remain critical importance . The potent class analgesic available general use remain opioids . Several line investigation focus neuro-physiological well neuro-chemical mechanism may underlay opioid resistant pain , opioid induce hyperalgesia opioid tolerance cause certain type pain relatively resistant opioids may underlie tolerance develop beneficial effect . Particular attention pay role play glutamate neurotransmission promote maintain chronic pain state . Glutamate primary excitatory neurotransmitter central nervous system normally release pain-signaling afferent neuron synapse central pain pathway spinal cord . The persistent release glutamate , due peripheral injury inflammation , lead activation N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor . This process activation show play crucial role mediating phenomenon `` wind '' pain , state spinal neuron become hyper-responsive repetitive painful stimulation . The clinically observed phenomenon allodynia ( pain due stimulus normally provoke pain ) hyperalgesia ( increase response stimulus normally painful ) , hallmarks neuropathic pain , expression `` wind '' pain . Recent investigation indicate process prevent mitigate agent block effect glutamate NMDA receptor . Other investigation reveal NMDA receptor antagonist useful potentiate analgesic efficacy several class medication , include opioids , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , local anesthetic . In addition , NMDA receptor antagonist may play important role mediating development opioid tolerance treat perplex syndrome opiate-induced hyperalgesia . Of small number NMDA receptor antagonist currently available clinical use , , unfortunately , either narrow therapeutic window require parenteral administration . Dextromethorphan , best know use antitussive agent , dose orally show activity noncompetitive NMDA antagonist . Multiple trial , however , generally show dextromethorphan effective treat neuropathic pain . Ketamine , phencyclidine ( PCP ) derivative analog , use 40 year produce `` dissociative '' anesthesia . Early experience ketamine reveal also produce analgesia sometimes well outlasted anesthetic effect . Although mechanisms ketamine 's analgesic effect remain subject debate , likely multiple , antagonism NMDA-receptor site appear central anesthetic analgesic effect . Ketamine 's utility anesthetic hamper troublesome psychomimetic effect , many year also limit application analgesic . Recent investigation show , however , analgesia produce sub-hypnotic sub-anesthetic dos intravenous ketamine ( ie,10 % -20 % use anesthesia ) far low frequency psychomimetic reaction . These side effect dose dependent minimize start ketamine low dos , titrate slowly , concurrently start benzodiazepine haloperidol . Over year variety nociceptive ( somatic visceral ) neuropathic pain state treat subanesthetic dos ketamine . Early study demonstrate utility treat pain associate wound dressing burn patient , treatment pain follow severe trauma cancer-related pain . Racemic ketamine oral bioavailability approximately 17 % . When administrate orally dose 0.5mg/kg plasma ketamine concentration ketamine 40 ngml-1 ( i.m . dose plasma ketamine concentration 150 ng ml-1 ) . Oral administration associate much great concentration metabolite norketamine , may contribute analgesic effect . Orally administer ketamine undergoes extensive first pas metabolism , primarily via N-de-methylation , result low ketamine concentration high norketamine concentration blood tissue . The plasma level analgesia achieve 0.15 μg/ml follow intramuscular administration 0.04 μg/ml oral administration . This difference may explain high norketamine concentration due first-pass metabolism . This main metabolite apparently contribute antinociceptive effect Oral ketamine potent ( 30 40 % ) subcutaneous route first pass metabolism convert ketamine active analgesic metabolite . The benefit harm add ketamine strong analgesic pain-killers morphine relief cancer pain yet establish . Only two small randomise controlled trial suggest ketamine give morphine may help control cancer pain . However , data insufficient ass effectiveness ketamine setting . So far little clinical evidence support practice , furthermore , The Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews 2009 conclude : `` Current evidence insufficient ass benefit harm ketamine adjuvant opioids relief cancer pain . More randomized randomise control trial need '' .</detailed_description>
