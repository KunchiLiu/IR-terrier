	<brief_summary>Misuse drug alcohol tremendous impact individual health society , term human suffer economic cost . Most substance abuser never seek specialty addiction treatment , large percentage receives form medical care , frequently emergency room setting . There considerable evidence show Screening , Brief Intervention , Referral , Treatment ( SBIRT ) intervention medical setting result decrease drink alcohol-related problem among alcohol abuse dependence . However , study use model focus drug user . Although drug user see large number emergency department , randomize control trial SBIRT model drug user present Emergency Departments ( EDs ) . This study design assess effect Assessment , Referral , Brief Intervention substance use individual screen positive drug use medical ED visit . The Southwest Node NIDA Clinical Trials Network , locate UNM CASAA , take lead study . Six sit across country participate study , include ED UNM Hospital . A total 1285 ED patient screen positive current drug use problem randomly assign receive 1 ) minimal screening , 2 ) assessment substance use referral treatment , 3 ) assessment referral combine 30-minute counseling session ( Brief Intervention ) two follow-up telephone counseling session . Outcomes assess 3 , 6 , 12 month ED visit . We hypothesize receive Brief Intervention least drug use follow-up , receive minimal screening ( usual current practice ) drug use , receive assessment referral without Brief intervention intermediate outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2 . STUDY SYNPOSIS AND SCHEMA STUDY OBJECTIVES : The study contrast substance use substance-related outcome among patient endorse problematic drug use emergency department ( ED ) visit randomly assign one three treatment condition : 1 ) minimal screening ( MSO ) ; 2 ) screening , assessment , referral treatment ( indicate ) ( SAR ) ; 3 ) screening , assessment , referral plus brief intervention ( BI ) two telephone follow-up booster session ( BI-B ) . STUDY DESIGN : The propose project 3-group randomize , prospective trial blind assessment . Individuals present ED endorse problematic drug use screen randomize 1:1:1 ratio MSO vs. SAR vs. BI-B . Randomization occur screen , randomize MSO receive assessment follow-up . The two group receive baseline assessment , assignment SAR vs. BI-B reveal baseline assessment complete . Those SAR group receive referral indicate request , assign BI-B group receive brief intervention consist motivational enhancement therapy ( MET ) adapt use ED , follow referral indicate request . The BI-B group also receive two booster telephone call , ideally within one week ED visit . Follow-up assessment three group conduct face-to-face 3 month , 6 month , 12 month post-enrollment . STUDY POPULATION : A total 1285 patient probable drug abuse dependence ( approximately 429 per group ) seek medical treatment ED , recruit 6 EDs , randomize MSO , SAR , BI-B . Each ED enroll approximately 215 participant . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : Participants men woman 18 year age old seek medical treatment ED , adequate English proficiency , able provide inform consent , endorse current ( past 30 day ) problematic use one drug , willing participate protocol ( e.g. , randomized treatment , participate follow-up assessment ) , access telephone . Individuals exclude incapable informed consent , prisoner police custody , currently engage addiction treatment , reside 50 mile site follow-up conduct , unable provide sufficient contact information , already participate study . TREATMENTS : The MSO group receive assessment treatment follow randomization , give informational pamphlet drug use potential consequence . The SAR group provide information pamphlet MSO group . In addition , follow assessment , SAR participants `` probable dependence '' one substance ( base ASSIST score ≥ 27 ) also provide referral treatment , consist positive recommendation seek treatment standardized list available treatment option . Participants request referral also receive one , regardless ASSIST score . Referrals make CTN-affiliated CTPs well community program normal clinical referral network participate EDs . Individuals randomize BI+Booster ( BI-B ) condition receive information referral SAR . In addition , ED BI-B group receive manual-guided brief intervention base motivational interviewing principle , include feedback base screen information , FRAMES heuristic , development change plan indicate . The brief intervention focus primarily problematic drug abuse identify participant . The BI provide person ED participant still . In addition , participant BI-B group receive 2 phone `` booster '' session check see whether engage treatment , review change plan , seek commitment ( Mello , Longabaugh et al . 2008 ) . The content booster pattern session Motivational Enhancement Therapy ( MET ) . The initial phone booster call occur within 3 day discharge ED possible , second within 7 day . Booster call make use centralized , study-wide intervention booster call center . SAFETY ASSESSMENT : Adverse Events ( AEs ) include Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) monitor report throughout study . These event subject ongoing monitoring study executive committee ( include representative lead node , NIDA , Clinical Coordinating Center ) , present DSMB review . OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS : The primary outcome day use patient-defined primary problem drug , assess Time-Line Follow-Back 30-day period precede 3-month follow-up . Secondary outcome include change baseline day use primary substance , number day abstinent drug , day heavy drinking , total quantity drug use , objective change drug use base analysis hair sample , self-reported consequence drug alcohol use , percent enter treatment among classified probable dependence , ED health care utilization . PRIMARY OUTCOME ANALYSIS : The primary analysis contrast MSO , SAR BI-B group respect primary outcome variable ( day use primary drug abuse 30 day precede 3-month follow-up ) use linear mixed model random site effect fix treatment effect intercept . Three pairwise contrast make overall type 1 error rate α = 0.05 . REGULATORY ISSUES : The trial conduct compliance protocol , ICH Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guideline , applicable regulatory requirement .</detailed_description>
