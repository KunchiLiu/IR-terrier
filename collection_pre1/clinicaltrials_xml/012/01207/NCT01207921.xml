	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy Post Autologous Transplant Hodgkins Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives -To evaluate feasibility lenalidomide maintenance therapy patient relapse Hodgkin lymphoma autologous stem cell transplant , measure dropout rate . Secondary Objectives - To assess overall survival , event free survival , progression free survival . - To establish adverse event profile long-term maintenance therapy lenalidomide patient population . - To assess conversion partial response/stable disease post-ASCT complete response . - To evaluate change immune cell number function plasma protein , , lenalidomide therapy ( correlative study ) .</detailed_description>
