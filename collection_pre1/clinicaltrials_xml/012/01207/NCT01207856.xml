	<brief_summary>Despite need cognitive rehabilitation , paucity well-designed research study investigate treatment approach effectiveness MS . Most published study suffer significant methodological flaw include small sample size , short follow-up period , lack specific outcome criterion determine improvement . O'Brien et al . ( 2008 ) recently review 16 study cognitive rehabilitation design person MS find 4 class I study one class I study rehabilitation attention deficit . Methodologically rigorous research need confirm preliminary result report study determine effectiveness efficacy cognitive rehabilitation intervention attention deficit MS. O'Brien et al . list limitation find previous study must address future study . The present study design accord recommendation . It randomize , control study , parallel group , evaluator blind . Number participant : 25 RRMS patient active group , 25 RRMS patient control group 25 healthy subject . The protocol propose RRMS patient AFFILIATED TO FRENCH SOCIAL SECURITY refer investigator center practice neurologist fulfil inclusion criterion screen . Patients randomise two group . The active group ( 25 patient ) treat rehabilitation . Individual rehabilitation procedure focus attention , executive function IPS . The program tailor patient cognitive status depend impairment identify initial assessment maintain systematic work attention executive function . A total 50 session last one hour rate 3 session per week total period 4 month propose . Patients randomize group participate group session every week without specific cognitive rehabilitation . 25 healthy control subject ( group C ) , match patient education , gender age patient group A/B evaluation procedure patient . Evaluation perform baseline , 4 month ( end treatment period ) 8 month . Evaluation include clinical testing , cognitive battery ( paper/pencil computer test ) , cognitive ecological evaluation ( Computer test attention virtual reality environment drive test driving simulator ) , questionnaires daily life MRI ( fMRI MRI ) . All patient healthy subject undergo fMRI protocol use paradigm previously publish investigator group ( Bonnet et al. , 2009 ) : Go/No-go paradigm increase difficulty four successive condition ( Tonic Alertness task , Go/No-go ( IG ) , reversal Go/No-go ( RG ) , complex Go/No-go ( CG ) . In previous study investigator observe compensatory activation MS patient compare healthy control three first condition saturation compensatory process complex . In present study , investigator hypothesize similar pattern occur baseline cognitive rehabilitation improve brain compensation fourth level complexity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Controlled Clinical Trial Cognitive Rehabilitation Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>: Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) frequent disable neurological disease young adult . Over past two decade , cognitive impairment MS receive increase interest . Although long time describe MS text book , underestimate recently . It accept important feature MS high impact work social ability . The cognitive disorder MS dominate slowdown information process speed ( IPS ) , well disturbances attention memory . The nature cognitive finding suggest impairment depend integrity large-scale cortical integrative process , involve long-distance white matter projection impair due diffuse demyelinate injury patient MS. At early stage MS increase evidence neuroplasticity , ability brain respond various insult , allow adaptive reorganization cognitive function limit impairment , despite widespread tissue damage . Recently , show early stage RRMS compensatory capacity relatively maintain , especially highly-educated patient suggest cognitive training might useful . The requirement cerebral compensatory mechanism perform cognitive test postulate MS patient basis functional MRI ( fMRI ) study . By use go/no go task increase complexity fMRI study RRMS patient , observed limitation compensatory cerebral recruitment appear attentional solicitation reach particular level difficulty . We postulate cognitive training program may help maintain compensatory capacity . Therefore , propose evaluate effect program brain activation use task several level attention requirement ( increased attention load ) use fMRI evaluate parallel clinical effect impact daily activity .</detailed_description>
