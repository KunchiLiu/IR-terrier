	<brief_title>The Effect Antiviral Therapy With Pegylated Interferon-alpha Auditory Disability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The population study : Patients chronic hepatitis C B treat pegylated interferon- alpha . Trial Design Primary end-point : ass rate auditory disability induce pegylated interferon alpha hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) hepatitisB virus ( HBV ) . Secondary end-point : investigate outcome auditory disability induce pegylated interferon alpha HCV HBV . Type/design trial conduct : Prospective , longitudinal control trial . In participant , base line conventional auditory assessment perform well end treatment . The result compare base-line measurement . At base line ( pre treatment ) , participant undergo thorough conventional audiological assessment include clinical assessment ear , nose throat ( E.N.T ) specialist pure-tone audiometry ( air conduction necessary also bone conduction ) , speech reception threshold discrimination . In case conductive defect detection , tympanometry add auditory assessment . Pure-tone audiometry re-performed week 12 anti-viral treatment end therapy : week 24 genotype 2/3 patient week 48 72 genotype 1 patient . Additional unscheduled audiometry test perform time study participant complain hearing loss tinnitus , follow-up assessment patient treatment-induced hearing loss ( schedule E.N.T specialist ( co-investigator ) . The follow audiometric parameter collect : - Pure Tone Average ( PTA ) - ( parameter reflect average frequency 500 , 1000 2000HZ ) ear . - Speech Reception Threshold ( SRT ) ear . - Discrimination value ear - The degree hearing loss ( decrease threshold sensitivity ) compare base line measurement [ Î”-differences decibel ( dB ) ] . If hearing loss detect within several frequency , average degree decrease sensitivity determine - Presence/absence tinnitus Trial Objectives Purpose To assess rate outcome auditory disability induce pegylated interferon alpha patient chronic viral hepatitis C B Hearing loss define decrease threshold sensitivity 15 dB great one test frequencies relation base line measurement ( order increase sensitivity hear loss detection ) . `` Auditory disability '' exist either hearing loss tinnitus occur . Management anti-treatment-induced hearing loss/tinnitus : In case detection hearing loss per schedule audiometric test follow clinical symptom ( patient 's complaint ) tinnitus occur , follow management carry : 1 . Repeated pure-tone audiometry perform every 5 day ( 4 test ) case , recovery hearing loss occur within 2 week . Further need additional follow-up audiometric testing determine investigator . 2 . A discussion perform documented case auditory disability . The severity hearing loss degree functional impairment , result follow-up audiometric testing , severity liver disease necessity continuation anti viral therapy discuss . In case mild , non-clinically significant non-progressive hearing loss , continuation anti viral therapy optional . In case , follow-up measurement test intervention carry . The need concomitant short course corticosteroid treatment discuss per case . In case significant and/or progressive hearing loss severe tinnitus , cessation anti-viral treatment consider . All participant identify initial trial number case report form ( CRF ) . Selection Withdrawal Subjects Inclusion criterion : Patients chronic hepatitis C virus infection receive anti viral treatment consist PEG-IFN-alpha-2a 2b combine ribavirin , Patients chronic hepatitis B receive anti-viral treatment PEG-IFN-alpha 2a ( Pegasys ) Age 18-70 eligible anti viral treatment . Patients attend treat Liver Unit Haifa Western Galilee District Clalit Health Services Carmel Medical Center recruit . Patients HCV genotype include treated standard-of-care therapy hepatitis C : 48 week genotypes 1 4 . Patients 24 week genotypes 2 3 . Virological response determine week 12 treatment . In non-responders therapy discontinue . In patient genotype 1 `` slow virological response '' , 72 week therapy consider . Included also patient chronic hepatitis B receive PEG-IFN alpha 2a 48 week . Study completion anticipate 3 year initiation . Subject exclusion criterion . 1 . Patients severe base line ( pre anti-viral treatment ) hearing loss ( &gt; 70 dB hearing level PTA ) exclude . 2 . Refusal participate study Subject withdrawal criterion : subject refuse continue participation study . Assessment Safety Auditory assessment associate adverse event completely safe Statistics The distribution continuous variable analyze use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test normality . The measured auditory parameter ( decibel ) patient compare three measurement time use ANOVA test repetitive measurement Friedman Two-way ANOVA test , need ( parametric non-parametric group respectively ) , follow Bonferroni post hoc test multiple comparison . Categorical group evaluate association use Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test , need . Two-tailed p value 0.05 less consider significant . The number subject plan enrol 100 patient . Criteria termination trial . Statistical analysis perform fpr participant complete auditory assessment end therapy .</detailed_description>
