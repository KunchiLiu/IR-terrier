	<brief_title>Identification Microcirculation After Surgical Treatment Rupture Achilles Tendon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project investigate microcirculation skin tendon rupture Achilles tendon . Three different treatment compare : stitch tendon , fibrin-glue combination . Every method long establish treated clinical equal . So surgical treatment choose randomly patient . For cause microcirculation register O2c , work measure reflect lightwaves . It strictly noninvasive cause absolutely pain patient . The measurement device consist two small probe , simply stick patientÂ´s skin . There nine measurement study : one one shortly surgery , follow three measure appointment every 6 hour ( 6,12,18,24 h post-op ) .Afterwards appointment plan 12 day 6 month . On last appointment patient question accord establish score like AOFAS VAS register functional outcome level pain . Clinical parameter like time rupture surgical treatment , hospitalisation time , form anaesthesia include create comparable patient profile . After 6 moth last measurement appointment state , clinical outcome register Scores , e.g Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon-Test . This study detect difference wound heeling , re-rupture rate functionality three method .</detailed_description>
