	<brief_summary>The doctor test Wilms Tumor-1 ( WT1 ) vaccine see delays prevents mesothelioma grow back surgery . WT1 protein cancer cell regulate gene expression cause cell growth . Mesothelioma tumor generally high level WT1.This study originally design two treatment group . One group receive non-specific immunotherapy medication call Montanide Sargramostim ( Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor , GM-CSF ) . Enrollment group stop The group , continue receives specific immunotherapy WT1 vaccine plus Montanide GM-CSF . Both Montanide GM-CSF commonly give along vaccine general effect boost immune response . Some researcher believe general increase immune system may effect treat cancer . Some study use GM-CSF melanoma vaccine suggest could lessen effect vaccine . The addition WT1 proteins make therapy direct mesothelioma . The combination WT1 vaccine Montanide GM-CSF test prior trial include 9 patient advanced mesothelioma . In trial , vaccine safe cause immune response .</brief_summary>
