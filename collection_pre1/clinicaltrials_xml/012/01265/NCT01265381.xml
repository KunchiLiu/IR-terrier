	<brief_summary>Background : - The Ukrainian Research Center Radiation Medicine U.S. National Institutes Health study cancer risk outcomes individual participate decontamination clean-up process follow Chornobyl nuclear accident . Some individual expose external radiation various level , well radioactive iodine may affect thyroid increase risk develop thyroid cancer . Because individual comparative data need affected population clean-up worker associate Chornobyl accident , researcher interest collect personal information saliva sample Chornobyl clean-up worker diagnose thyroid cancer . Objectives : - To assess radiation-related risk thyroid cancer among male Chornobyl clean-up worker collect saliva sample initial study . Eligibility : - Male Chornobyl clean-up worker Kyiv Donetsk oblasts diagnose thyroid cancer . Design : - Participants complete standardize questionnaire personal interview . The questionnaire ask detail information follow area study : - Work history , condition , activity inside 70-km clean-up radiation calculation zone . - Residence history inside outside 30-km exclusion zone . - Milk consumption April 26 June 30 , 1986 ( assess radioactivity radioiodine fallout ) . - Potential non-radiation risk factor thyroid cancer ( e.g. , smoking , alcohol consumption , family cancer history ) . - Participants provide saliva sample pilot study test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thyroid Cancer Among Chornobyl Clean-up Workers Ukraine : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Much know radiation-related risk thyroid cancer , considerable uncertainty magnitude radiation risk among exposed adult , particularly male . A large number clean-up worker , mostly male , participated decontamination clean-up activity Chornobyl accident expose external radiation various level . An increased thyroid cancer risk report study Russian , Estonian Latvian clean-up worker , little evidence dose response . However , recent publish data IARC study thyroid cancer case control pooled Chornobyl clean-up worker Belarus , Russia Baltic country show strong dose response estimate risk per unit dose much high report irradiated population expose adult . Following completion NCI study leukemia among Ukrainian clean-up worker , propose nest case-control study ass radiation-related risk thyroid cancer among 150,000 male cleanup worker Ukraine . In preparation study , pilot study progress ass feasibility full study . Objectives : The objective ( ) identify thyroid cancer case demographically match control without thyroid cancer occur among 150,000 Ukrainian clean-up worker linkage National Cancer Registry Chernobyl State Registry Ukraine ; ( ii ) trace/locate interview small sample subject thyroid cancer respective control ; ( iii ) obtain saliva buccal cell sample ; ( iv ) locate transfer thyroid tumor specimen identify case archive maintain Research Center Radiation Medicine ( RCRM ) , diagnostic verification possible future genetic/molecular research use late available technique . Eligibility : The cohort include Ukrainian clean-up worker meet follow eligibility criterion : male , first year service clean-up worker ( 1986-1990 ) ; initial registration clean-up worker one study area ; age first work Chornobyl zone ( 60 ) . For pilot study , select 100-110 case thyroid cancer three study area , Kyiv , Donetsk Dnipropetrovsk oblasts control ( case-control ratio 1:3 ) . We assess feasibility proxy interview decease thyroid cancer case study area . Design : This pilot study conduct framework plan nest case-control study cohort Chornobyl clean-up worker involve small number subject thyroid cancer respective control . Thyroid cancer case identify linkage Cancer Registry Ukraine . Controls identify Chernobyl State Registry . Locating archived tumor tissue do search Cancer Registry Ukraine database supplement interview data . Consent transfer tissue RCRM seek time interview .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : For pilot study , select cleanup worker thyroid cancer report three study area , Kyiv , Donetsk Dnipropetrovsk oblasts control ( casecontrol ratio 1:3 ) demographically match case . We estimate number case 100 110 . These two oblasts choose represent area know , leukemia study , high study participation rate ( Kyiv Dnipropetrovsk oblasts ) area newly add thus unknown regard participation rate ( Donetsk ) . All study subject males average 55 year . In view high survival rate thyroid cancer , majority subject expect alive . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Excluded study locate , refuse participate study , provide informed consent .</criteria>
