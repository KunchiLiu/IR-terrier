	<brief_title>Study Sorafenib With Without VT-122 Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The common clinical course patient cancer local tumor progression lead development metastasis , systemic inflammation ensue symptom cluster know anorexia-cachexia syndrome . This syndrome include cachexia ( anorexia , weight loss muscle waste ) , fatigue , weakness , pain , dyspnea , nausea , malaise , depression poor performance status . Patients suffer syndrome also poor tolerance , adherence response anti-cancer therapy , result disease progression reduce life expectancy . In spite dire need , prove option treat inflammatory cancer cachexia currently available . VT-122 co-administration cyclo-oxygenase 2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor , etodolac beta-adrenergic antagonist , propranolol . It propose drug attenuate systemic inflammation ameliorate symptom inflammatory cachexia patient advance cancer . As result , treatment may improve tolerability adherence anti-cancer therapy , thereby yield direct indirect benefit reduce disease progression improve life expectancy quality life patient advanced cancer . The potentially synergistic activity beta blocker COX-2 inhibitor , offset side effect know beneficial impact co-morbidities associate liver failure may make well-suited use sorafenib , standard care patient advance HCC . The purpose study ass whether use VT-122 safe effective cachectic patient advance HCC . In addition assess cachexia-related symptom , ability VT-122 regimen improve tolerability sorafenib thereby improve survival quality life also assess .</detailed_description>
