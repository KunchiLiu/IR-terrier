	<brief_summary>The objective study identify mechanisms compound find cruciferous vegetable alter gene expression via epigenetic modification ( change gene expression ) may prevent prostate cancer development . The investigator find sulforaphane ( SFN ) , isothiocyanate find cruciferous vegetable , inhibits histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) activity human colorectal prostate cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer frequently diagnose non-cutaneous cancer second lead cause cancer death American men . The precise etiologic factor initiate enhance progression prostate cancer remain unknown , epigenetic alteration diet/lifestyle factor come forth significant contribute factor . Epidemiologic study suggest cruciferous vegetable intake decrease risk prostate cancer . The long-term goal proposal identify mechanisms dietary compound , find cruciferous vegetable decrease prostate cancer risk . The objective study identify mechanisms compound find cruciferous vegetable alter gene expression via epigenetic modification may prevent prostate cancer development . The investigator find SFN , isothiocyanate find cruciferous vegetable , inhibits HDAC activity human colorectal prostate cancer cell . Targeting epigenome , include use HDAC DNA methyltransferase ( DNMT ) inhibitor , evolve strategy cancer chemoprevention show promise cancer clinical trial . This Randomized , Double Blind , Clinical Trial address follow objective : 1 . Identify distribution SFN metabolites HDAC inhibition follow SFN supplementation subject risk prostate cancer ( Primary Endpoints ) 2 . Investigate effect broccoli sprout supplementation DNA methylation status proliferation marker pre-biopsy setting ( secondary analysis ) The effect short-term SFN supplementation benign epithelial tissue study men characterize risk prostate cancer randomize , placebo-controlled trial . Men schedule prostate biopsy recruit trial . Following successful completion consent , two 10 mL blood specimen study analysis , 4 mL specimen total bilirubin assessment drawn subject provide urine sample . The study coordinator explain Diet History questionnaire ( DHQ ) administer risk factor adverse event ( AE ) questionnaires order obtain data potential confounding dietary variable gain subject ' baseline symptom . The study coordinator provide subject four-week supply either SFN glucosinolate capsule match placebo , dispense Research Pharmacy . Around every 2 week , study coordinator call complete AE reporting change medication supplement complete brief cruciferous vegetable intake checklist . Subjects return unused study `` drug '' study coordinator time biopsy ( 4 week visit subject 's prostate biopsy delay ) .</detailed_description>
