	<brief_summary>Urothelial carcinoma bladder mostly chemically induced represent second prevalent urooncological disease . About 20 % newly diagnose urothelial carcinoma case bladder already advanced metastasize . Before 2008 2009 second line therapy failure primary systemic therapy advance / metastatic disease establish outside clinical trial . The actual standard situation supportive , symptomatic therapy . Vinflunine demonstrate improved survival 4.3 6.9 month ( p=0.04 ) , adequate disease control , good symptom control acceptable toxicity . Based result , compound become standard se¬cond line treatment refractory metastatic bladder cancer disease failure platinum-containing therapy . As prognosis still remain poor , new treatment opportunity explore . The target-specific therapy Pazopanib suggest positive influence inductive perioperative treatment solid tumor . Pazopanib approve FDA EMA treatment advance renal cell carcinoma . Results advance urothelial carcinoma miss far well data tolerability combination vinflunine pazopanib . As pharmacodynamic property well safety profile drug different , assumption justify might occur additive efficacy effect without addition adverse outcome . Aim study thus 1 . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Pazopanib combination Vinflunine phase-I-setting 2 . To assess efficacy safety combination MTD level phase II . During pase-I-part study different dos pazopanib add standard vinflunine scheme group 6 patient maximum . Dose escalation perform next patient group one six patient show dose-limiting toxicity . Each patient treat drug combination duration two vinflunine cycle , six week . During phase-II study new patient treat drug combination maximum-tolerated dose disease progression ( assessed RECIST 1.1 procedure ) .</brief_summary>
