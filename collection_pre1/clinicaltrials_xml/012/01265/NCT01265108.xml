	<brief_summary>During alveolar hypoxia , example high altitude patient respiratory disease , evidence suggest hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension might limit exercise performance . Intravenous iron supplementation recently show reverse pulmonary hypertension healthy human high altitude , prevent pulmonary hypertension volunteer expose hypoxia sea level . The investigator hypothesize intravenous iron supplementation would enhance exercise capacity alveolar hypoxia .</brief_summary>
