	<brief_title>Neuro-orthopaedic Surgery Treatment Spastic Equinovarus Foot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Stroke third cause death lead cause handicap among industrialized country ( 1 ) . Spasticity follow stroke responsible spastic equinovarus foot ( SEF ) 18 % case ( 2 ) . Spastic equinovarus foot due spasticity ( muscle hypertonia ) calf muscle ( soleus , gastrocnemius tibialis posterior ) , often complicate contracture weakness peroneus longus peroneus brevis muscle ( 3 ) . Therefore , stroke patient walk slowly , often require assistive device orthosis cane . This disability limit social participation quality life . Spastic equinovarus foot treatment include oral medication , physical therapy , orthosis , chemical denervations ( botulinum toxin , alcohol phenol injection ) , selective neurotomy orthopedic surgery ( 3 ) . Selective neurotomy neurosurgical procedure consist partially selectively cut motor branch innervate spastic muscle provide permanent treatment spasticity ( 3 ) . Orthopaedic surgery consist Achilles tendon lengthen tibialis anterior transfer ( 3 ) . The efficacy mixed neur-orthopaedic surgery never prospectively assess accord ICF classification . OBJECTIVES The aim present project study effectiveness neuro-orthopaedic surgery ( neurotomy tendon surgery ) treatment SEF . The functional assessment explore three ICF domain . METHODS The investigator recruit 50 chronic spastic patient present SEF . The surgical treatment decide accord improvement obtain anaesthetic diagnostic tibial motor nerve branch block ( 5 ) follow interdisciplinary discussion . Patients assess treatment , 2 month , 1 year 2 year treatment among 3 ICF domain . Impairments assess Stoke Impairment Assessment Set ( SIAS ) , Ashworth Tardieu scale ( spasticity ) MRC scale ( muscle strength ) . Gait disorder evaluate video analysis . Disability evaluate ABILOCO scale ( 6 ) participation ( quality life ) SATIS-Stroke questionnaire ( 7 ) SF-36 questionnaire . The patient selection , lidocaine hyperselective diagnostic block , selective neurotomy tendon surgery achieve medical doctor participant spasticity group . The functional assessment achieve physical therapist PMR department ( blind assessor ) . PERSPECTIVE The investigator hope demonstrate benefit neuro-orthopaedic surgery case SEF accord 3 domain ICF ( 8 )</detailed_description>
