	<brief_summary>Desmoid-type fibromatosis ( desmoid tumor ) represent intermediate grade neoplasm strike predilection locally invasive growth recurrence follow resection . It occur child well young adult . As typically localized disease , historical standard care treatment surgical resection , without ionize radiation . In case surgical resection radiation feasible , chemotherapy use . Two clinical trial conduct Pediatric Oncology Group ( POG ) Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) evaluate role either low intensity non-cytotoxic chemotherapy child desmoid tumor amenable standard therapy . These largely empirical treatment strategy base somewhat anecdotal observation . By good understanding desmoid tumor biology , even effective therapy target particular protein central disease develop . Desmoid tumor well-known associate deregulation Adenomatous Polyposis Cell/beta-catenin ( APC/β-catenin pathway ) . This true familial case associate Gardner 's Syndrome also sporadic desmoid tumor , nearly display histological molecular evidence Adenomatous Polyposis Cell/beta-catenin ( APC β-catenin ) pathway activation ( Alman et al. , 1997 ; Lips et al. , 2009 ) . Several new piece evidence support concept deregulation mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) cell proliferation/survival pathway may play important role tumor biology APC/β-catenin pathway disrupt . Sirolimus , drug inhibits mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) , currently evaluate anti-cancer agent variety tumor type , previously study desmoid tumor . The investigator conduct pilot study begin explore whether mTOR inhibition may beneficial child young adult desmoid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluating Use mTor Inhibitor Sirolimus Children Young Adults With Desmoid-Type Fibromatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose translational research project directly test hypothesis mTOR active desmoid tumor child young adult . Activity assess clinical histological study follow course pre-operative chemotherapy use sirolimus . Clinical response measure use validate pain assessment scale desmoid tumor size unlikely change course pre-operative chemotherapy study . Histological response base quantify phosphorylation follow mTOR target : thr389p-p70S6K , p-4E-BP1 , ser473p-AKT .</detailed_description>
