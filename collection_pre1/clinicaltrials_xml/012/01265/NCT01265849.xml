	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether LI administer combination cyclophosphamide , indomethacin zinc ( CIZ ) multivitamin combination prior standard care therapy ( surgery follow radiotherapy concurrent radiochemotherapy ) safe increase overall survival subject previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity soft palate median 3 year</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Leukocyte Interleukin , Injection ( LI ) Treat Cancer Oral Cavity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck carcinoma constitute 5 % cancer annually worldwide . In US 37,000 new case annually . Ninety percent advance primary squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCHN ) . Approximately 2/3 SCCHN patient present first visit locally advanced disease . The median 3 year overall survival ( OS ) patient exist standard care ( SOC ) therapies - surgery follow radiotherapy combine radiochemotherapy - 52 55 % ; 5 year OS 43 % . There clearly large number SCCHN patient well serve available modality . Regional intra perilymphatic and/or intratumoral peritumoral low dose cytokine therapy may important therapeutic effect SCCHN patient constitute additional anti-tumor mechanism action different distinct current SOC . Leukocyte Interleukin Injection ( LI ) [ Multikine ] contains define mixture naturally derive cytokine chemokines demonstrate safety immunomodulatory activity animal man Phase 1 2 clinical trial . LI administer prior SOC combination low non-chemotherapeutic dos cyclophosphamide , indomethacin , zinc ( CIZ ) study LI . The result study indicate local/regional injection mixed interleukin ( LI ) CIZ prior SOC overcome local immunosuppression , break tumor tolerance tumor antigens allow sustainable effective anti-tumor immune response . LI test large , global , multinational Phase III clinical trial develop definitive proof efficacy safety treat SCCHN . The trial open-label randomize multi-center control study LI + CIZ + SOC subject advance primary SCCHN oral cavity/soft palate vs. SOC [ The Comparator Arms , Overall Survival , Primary End Point Study ] .</detailed_description>
