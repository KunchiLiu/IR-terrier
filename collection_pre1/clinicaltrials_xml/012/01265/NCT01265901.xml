	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label , randomized phase III study investigate whether therapeutic vaccination IMA901 , mult-peptide cancer vaccine ( TUMAP ) , prolong overall survival patient metastatic and/or locally advance RCC add standard first-line therapy sunitinib ( primary endpoint ) . Secondary endpoint include subgroup analysis overall survival patient positive prospectively defined primary biomarker signature ( identify predictive improved clinical outcome IMA901-vaccinated patient previous phase II study ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , best overall response , cellular immunomonitoring subset patient , safety . Safety analysis base adverse event ( AEs ) , physical examination , vital sign , hematology , clinical chemistry , urinalysis ECG change . Further endpoint include subgroup analysis overall survival patient positive prospectively defined biomarkers ( identify previous phase II study ) , exploratory screen new biomarkers ( investigated patient ' blood paraffin section tumor tissue ) predict good clinical outcome response vaccination IMA901 . Biomarker set use patient selection study .</detailed_description>
