	<brief_summary>Translocator protein ( TSPO ) intracellular protein find primarily out membrane mitochondrion encode TSPO gene . It find TSPO expression skin correlate cell proliferation differentiation . Many study show TSPO overexpression solid malignancy ovarian cancer , colon cancer , others , also find correlate aggressive cancer behavior . Working Hypothesis Aims : Previous study describe aberrant expression TSPO level solid malignancy compare normal tissue . It assume aberration find cuntaneous malignancy well . The occurrence aberration may lead understand mechanism TSPO involment cutaneous malignancy , malignancies general . Methods : The study carry surgically resect skin lesion suspect SCC BCC , remove part surgical routine treatment . The excision make elliptic shape include lesion part normal skin surround . A sample take central part lesion external extremity normal tissue . Western Blot conduct detect expression TSPO . Binding activity TSPO specific ligandwill also determine . Expected Results : We expect observe either ( ) high level TSPO expression lower binding activity malignant tissue compare healthy control tissue ( b ) high level TSPO expression lower binding activity malignant tissue compare healthy control tissue . Importance : Until today , small number study examine TSPO cutaneous malignancy , examine TSPO expression . Our study also measure bind activity TSPO cutaneous malignant tissue compare normal tissue</brief_summary>
