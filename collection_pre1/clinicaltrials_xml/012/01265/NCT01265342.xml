	<brief_title>Efficacy Nebulised Beclometasone Viral Wheezing Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Viral wheezing ( intermittent episode wheeze induced viral infection upper respiratory tract ) common condition pre-school child . Its incidence estimate 6 30 % varies depend criterion , diagnosis , age definition use . Viral wheezing , however , different atopic asthma , since 60 % case symptoms disappear age 6 . The efficacy drug treatment prevention and/or treatment viral wheeze controversial ; short act beta 2 agonist often consider first choice therapy even evidence scarce The usefulness inhale steroid also debate : benefit document maintenance low dose inhaled corticosteroid , episodic use high dose may modest improvement symptom . Despite scant evidence , however , nebulised steroid particular beclomethasone , widely prescribe Italy prophylaxis treatment viral wheezing . Beclometasone third prescribed drug Italian child , prevalence estimate around 15 % A randomized placebo-controlled trial therefore plan evaluate effectiveness nebulised beclometasone prevent viral wheeze child upper respiratory tract infection . Besides investigate drug efficacy , study could also monitor incidence viral wheeze recurrence preschool child , disease 's natural history different therapeutic approach use physician . The study involve 36 Italian family paediatricians 9 local health unit . Children randomize receive beclomethasone placebo . The treatment period last 10 day , follow observational 6 month follow-up period . Three visit schedule : first baseline , second end treatment period third end follow-up period .

In case wheeze and/or lack improvement , paediatrician visit child , evaluate presence wheeze rate . A wheeze score assign follow : 0 = wheezing , 1 = end-expiratory wheeze , 2 = wheeze entire expiratory without inspiratory phase , audible stethoscope , 3 = inspiratory expiratory wheeze audible without stethoscope .</detailed_description>
