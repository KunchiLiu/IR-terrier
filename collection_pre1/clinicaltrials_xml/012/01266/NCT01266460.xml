	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tolerability , safety , nature degree toxicity ADXS11-001 ( live-attenuated Listeria monocytogenes cancer vaccine ADXS11-001 ) number patient dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) adverse event assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4.0 . II . To assess activity ADXS11-001 patient persistent recurrent carcinoma cervix frequency patient survive least 12 month initiate therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize distribution progression-free survival overall survival . II . To examine proportion patient objective tumor response . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess change clinical immunology base upon serum cytokine correlate observe change clinical response include progression-free survival , overall survival , tumor response , DLTs , adverse effect . II . To examine association presence type high-risk human papillomavirus ( H-HPV ) measure clinical response serum cytokine level . OUTLINE : Patients receive live-attenuated Listeria monocytogenes cancer vaccine ADXS11-001 intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
