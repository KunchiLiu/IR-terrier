	<brief_summary>Therapeutic HIV vaccine design control HIV infection boost body 's natural immune response . There currently FDA-approved therapeutic HIV vaccine . This study test whether give HIV-1 vaccine together without interleukin 12 ( IL-12 ) safe effective . This study also test new way give vaccine call electroporation ( EP ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Investigational HIV-1 Vaccine With Without Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) HIV-1 Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) greatly reduce HIV infection-related morbidity mortality , individual response therapy variable . Therapeutic vaccination work augment virus-specific immunity give without immunomodulatory agent adjuvant . In conjunction HAART , therapeutic vaccination may effective treatment suppression HIV-1 replication . This study examine safety efficacy give investigational vaccine without IL-12 HIV-1 infect adult receive HAART . This study also test whether deliver vaccine use EP safe increase efficacy vaccine . Participation study last approximately 36 week . Participants randomly assign one five cohort . Cohort 1 receive HIV multi-antigen plasmid DNA ( HIV MAG pDNA ) vaccine placebo intramuscularly ( IM ) upper arm follow EP . Cohorts 2 4 receive HIV MAG pDNA vaccine sequentially increase dos GENEVAX IL-12 pDNA placebo IM/EP . Cohort 5 receive HIV MAG pDNA vaccine high dose IL-12 pDNA placebo needle syringe upper arm . Participants receive two injection Weeks 0 , 4 , 12 . Participants complete questionnaire assess acceptability vaccine remain clinic 30 minute observation vaccination . Participants contact telephone 2 3 day post-vaccination assess vaccination-related sign and/or symptom . All participant ask record temperature symptoms experience daily 4 day follow vaccination Vaccination Report Card ( VRC ) . All nonstudy vaccine medication also record VRC . Study visit occur Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 24 , 36 . At visit , participant undergo physical examination . Women reproductive potential also undergo pregnancy test receive injection Weeks 0 , 4 , 12 . Blood drawn various time point evaluate participant ' health measure immunologic marker , CD4 CD8 T-cell count , cytokine level . Blood plasma also store future exploratory study .</detailed_description>
