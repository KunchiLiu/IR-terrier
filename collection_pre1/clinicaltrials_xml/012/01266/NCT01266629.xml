	<brief_title>The Clinical Utility Fecal Caprotectin Lactoferrin Patients Undergoing Capsular Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Capsule endoscopy ( CE ) , novel wireless method investigate small bowel use remote instrument swallow propelled gastrointestinal tract action peristalsis . The capsule contain image device , transmits image intestine sensor abdominal wall . It ability detect diffuse mucosal disease without inadvertent radiation exposure . Numerous study compare utility small bowel radiology CE investigation Crohn 's disease . A recent meta-analysis show CE superior small bowel radiology , CT enterography ileo-colonoscopy setting suspect Crohn 's disease . Capsule endoscopy develop establish role investigation pathway small bowel Crohn 's disease . However CE require placement eight-lead sensor array abdomen receive image localization data transmit capsule . The current process apply array skin several disadvantage : firstly , time-consuming ; secondly , cumbersome patient ; thirdly , often difficult place lead consistently . Moreover , CE expensive result largely influence operator 's skill . Among available fecal biomarkers diagnosis monitor inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , calprotectin lactoferrin translate useful clinical tool . Calprotectin ( MRP8/14 ) calcium-binding heterodimer S100 protein family , present granulocyte , macrophage , epithelial cell human mammals.It believe play essential role immunity . Calprotectin release upon neutrophil/monocyte activation , detect serum body fluid , include stool . It poorly degrade passage gastrointestinal tract remain stable refrigerated storage . Together , feature make calprotectin potentially useful marker clinical inflammatory neoplastic state . Recently , several study suggest high fecal calprotectin concentration may distinguish patient inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) patient irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) . Lactoferrin ( LF ) iron bind glycoprotein secrete mucosal membrane major component secondary granule polymorphonuclear neutrophil , component inflammatory response . A number study investigate use lactoferrin non invasive marker distinction inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) non inflammatory condition . Whilst high sensitivity LF report active IBD comparison IBS , distinction inactive IBD IBS less clear . Lactoferrin detect use simple cheap technique excellent stability feces long period time . Fecal lactoferrin good diagnostic precision separate organic functional intestinal disease . The aim prospective study assess clinical utility fecal calprotectin lctoferrin patient undergoing CE . Exclusion criterion Intake nonsteroidal agent and/or antibiotic three month precede study , concomitant serious illness , pregnancy , alcohol abuse , evidence respiratory tract infection . Study protocol After obtain informed consent patient , data collect patient symptom include presence abdominal pain , weight loss , diarrhoea , abdominal mass , extra-intestinal manifestation family history IBD . All patient undergo non diagnostic colonoscopy gastro copy prior CE referral . Study protocol include diagnostic CE stool examination . Stool Analysis Prior CE preparation , patient ask supply stool specimen store household freezer bring day examination . The specimen freeze -20Â°C assay . Fecal calprotectin level determine commercially available quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay ( Calpreset ; Eurospital , Trieste , Italy IBD SCAN ) . Faecal lactoferrin test perform thaw sample previously describe .Normal level calprotectin define 25 mg/kg stool . Capsule endoscopy The description CE well report literature ( Pillcam SB , Given Imaging , Yoqneum , Ltd ) .Patients fast overnight 12 hour ingestion two sachet polyethylene glycol solution ( Kleen-Prep , Norgine ) . Patients allow drink 2 hour eat light snack 4 hour ingestion capsule . Blood marker In addition , blood collect patient measurement complete blood count , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) level , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) standard method ( normal value ESR &lt; 12 mm/h ; CRP &lt; 5 mg/l ) . Calprotectin lactoferrin level stool compare clinical laboratory parameter .</detailed_description>
