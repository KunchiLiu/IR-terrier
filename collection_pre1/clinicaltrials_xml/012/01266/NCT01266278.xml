	<detailed_description>Shoulder complaint common overhead athlete . Throwing motion question large explosive strength stability intrinsic instable shoulder joint . Malpositioning scapula increase risk overload injury . The application kinesiotape keep shoulder correct position use avoid . Until study show tape able correct position scapula . If case , application tape could enlarge dynamic size subacromial space ( virtual space shoulder rotator cuff tendon run ) thus contribute prevention shoulder injury . This study take place collaboration Prof. Dr. Robert Van Cingel , director Sports Medical Center Papendal ( SMCP ) Netherlands . SMCP multidisciplinary center sport medicine , sport rehabilitation sport cardiology . 30 young elite handball player participate study . Three researcher perform number measurement apply kinesiotape correct shoulder position . 1 . Measurement size subacromial space dynamic ultrasound . Ultrasound completely harmless painless . 2 . Measurement three-dimensional kinematics shoulder FASTRAK . Sensors place skin shoulder adhesive tape . Both placement marker measurement non-invasive painless . 3 . Assessment shoulder posture measure several angle distance . Measurement shoulder strength mobility . These measurement non-invasive painless . Hypothesis study tape influence position scapula therefore able change size subacromial space . This result efficient use shoulder muscle higher maximal strength result maximize shoulder mobility .</detailed_description>
