	<brief_summary>Metformin , drug use since 1950 's treatment diabetes , recently generate great interest anticancer effect base vitro , vivo clinical study . This study assess pharmacodynamic effect metformin breast cancer metabolism . The trial design base 2 centre study 'Early Antiangiogenic Response Bevacizumab Primary Breast Cancer ' successfully complete recruitment Oxford Mount Vernon hospital . The study take advantage 2 week window first clinic visit commencement neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Metformin give patient least 2 week prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy set 3 breast core biopsy , PET-CT scan blood test carry 2 week period treatment . Patients also receive drink heavy ( deuterated ) water , safe stable isotope commonly use clinical lipid metabolism study , even prior set core biopsy . Having complete first 2 week metformin patient option continue metformin completion chemotherapy , discretion trial physician . The core biopsy use assess change : - immunohistochemical staining ; - gene profile ; - uptake heavy water tumour fatty acid use mass spectrometry technique . The aim identify potential biomarkers response metformin ( future cancer metabolism drug ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Metformin safe well tolerate drug widely use treatment diabetes 50 year . There grow evidence vitro laboratory animal work metformin anticancer property . In addition retrospective clinical study diabetic population demonstrate evidence markedly increase pathological response rate ( typically robust surrogate clinical endpoint efficacy ) pre-surgical chemotherapy early breast cancer patient also take metformin part diabetes treatment . There several study metformin cancer patient ongoing develop worldwide These predominantly relatively unselected cancer population clinical outcome endpoint . However study study currently plan carry substantial assessment pharmacodynamic endpoint . It important study carry early stage development metformin potential cancer therapy order ensure future large scale study properly inform .</detailed_description>
