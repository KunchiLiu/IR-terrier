	<criteria>Cohort A : No prior local therapy brain metastasis . Subjects receive concomitant corticosteroid must stable decrease dose least 3 week prior first dose study treatment . No prophylactic preventive antiepileptic therapy . Exception : antiepileptic therapy indicate order prevent neurologic symptom cause preexist condition relate brain metastasis allow . Cohort B : Subjects must receive least one local therapy brain metastasis include restrict brain surgery , Whole Brain Radiotherapy Stereotactic Radiosurgery ( e.g . gamma knife , linearacceleratedbased radiosurgery , charge particle , CyberKnife ) . Multiple local therapy combination local therapy allow . For subject receive local therapy brain lesion ( include WBRT ) , progression preexist lesion base RECIST 1.1 ( &gt; 20 % increase long diameter baseline scan ) new measurable lesion require . For subject receive local therapy lesion , disease progression base RECIST 1.1 require long remain brain lesion measurable previously treat . Subjects receive concomitant corticosteroid must stable decrease dose least 2 week prior first dose study treatment . Prophylactic preventive antiepileptic therapy allow . General : Must sign write informed consent . Must least 18 year age . Histologically confirm metastatic melanoma ( Stage IV ) , carry BRAF V600E V600Kmutation . Up two previous treatment regimens extracranial metastatic melanoma include chemo , cytokine , immuno , biological vaccinetherapy . At least one measurable intracranial target lesion follow criterion meet : previously untreated progressive accord RECIST 1.1 ( great equal 20 % increase long diameter baseline scan ) previous local therapy immediate local therapy clinically indicate patient suitable candidate receive immediate local therapy large diameter great equal 0.5cm less equal 4 cm determine contrastenhanced MRI target lesion ( definition see Section 6.1.1 ) diameter great 0.5 cm less equal 1 cm document measurement neuroradiologist require . lesion diameter great equal 3 cm less equal 4 cm document measurement neuroradiologist require . Time interval last day previous antitumour systemic treatment first dose GSK2118436 : 14 day elapse last treatment surgery , SRS gamma knife 28 day elapse last treatment WBRT Greater equal 28 day five halflives ( whichever longer ) elapse last dose approve investigational chemo , cytokine , immune , biological , vaccinetherapy . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 01 . Adequate organ function . Women childbearing potential men reproductive potential must willing practice acceptable method birth control study . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior first dose study treatment . Neurological symptom related brain metastasis . Previous treatment BRAF MEK inhibitor . Current expect use prohibited medication treatment GSK2118436 . Presence leptomeningeal disease primary dural metastasis . Known allergy contrast agent require magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) intracranial lesion . Current use therapeutic warfarin . NOTE : Low molecular weight heparin prophylactic lowdose warfarin permit . Unresolved toxicity National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 4.0 ( NCI v4.0 ) Grade 2 high previous anticancer therapy , except alopecia . Presence active gastrointestinal disease condition interfere significantly absorption drug . A history know Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection . Acute infection require intravenous antibiotic History another malignancy . Exception : ( ) Subjects diseasefree 5 year , ( b ) history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer , ( c ) successfully treat situ carcinoma , ( ) CLL stable remission , ( e ) indolent prostate cancer require antihormonal therapy histologically confirm tumour lesion clearly differentiate melanoma target nontarget lesion eligible .
