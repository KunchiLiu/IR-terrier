	<brief_title>A Study Assess Effects Fluticasone Furoate GW642444M Combination Healthy Subjects Subjects With Mild , Moderate Severe Hepatic Impairment .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In relation severity , hepatic disease significantly modify drug absorption disposition consequently interfere drug efficacy and/or produce toxicity . Pathological modification liver structure functionality might result complex modification various factor include liver blood flow , hypoalbuminaemia , indirectly affect renal function reduce hepatic drug metabolize capability include microsomal oxidase system [ Howden , 1989 ] . Although FF/GW642444M deliver directly site action , i.e . lung , large portion administer dose swallow . For FF GW642444 drug absorb GI tract undergoes first pass metabolism via CYP3A4 . In addition , drug absorb systemic circulation metabolise liver remove biliary clearance . Hence , possibility use patient impaired liver function pharmacokinetics inhale FF and/or GW642444 may change due reduce first pas metabolism and/or reduce clearance . The result study aid decide whether dose adjustment justify estimate adjustment patient impaired hepatic function . This open-label , non-randomized study ass pharmacokinetics safety inhale FF 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg subject hepatic impairment follow 7 day daily dose . Subjects mild , moderate severe hepatic impairment ( define Child-Pugh score 5-15 ) recruit along healthy control subject match moderate subject ( match gender , ethnicity , body mass index +/-15 % , age +/-5 year ) . Approximately thirty-six subject recruit : 9 subject severity 9 match healthy subject . All subject schedule receive FF 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg daily 7 day . The dose subject severe hepatic impairment may adjust FF 100mcg/GW642444M 12.5mcg review PK safety data moderate healthy match control subject . The result study aid decide whether dose adjustment require subject hepatic impairment estimate adjustment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Male female 18 70 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) ( healthy subject ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method Section 8.1 wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method list Section 8.1 appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception completion followup visit . BMI within range 19 33 kg/m^2 . Able satisfactorily use dry powder inhalation inhaler . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Single QTcF &lt; 450 msec ; QTcF &lt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . Able satisfactorily use dry powder inhaler . Healthy subject : AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin ≤1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure outcome . Hepatically Impaired Subjects : Hepatically impair . To classify hepatically impaired , subject must : Known medical history liver disease without known history alcohol abuse ; A ChildPugh score 515 cover severity ( Mild = 56 point ; Moderate = 79 point ; Severe = 1015 point ) . The component contribute CP score directly relate underlying hepatic disease nonhepatic disease . Subjects significant abnormality , apart impaired hepatic function relate symptom , clinical examination . A subject clinical abnormality may include Investigator considers abnormality introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Hepatically impaired subject laboratory parameter outside reference range include , opinion Investigator , result clinically important introduces additional risk factor . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Suffered low respiratory tract infection 4 week screen visit . Taken oral corticosteroid le 8 week screen visit . Taken inhale , intranasal topical steroid le 4 week screen visit . Have know sensitivity corticosteroid and/or long act beta agonist . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A positive test HIV antibody . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Pregnant female determine positive serum urine hCG test screen prior dosing . Lactating female . The subject treat diagnosed depression within six month screen history significant psychiatric illness . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol .

Subjects predispose condition might interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion drug previous gastrointestinal ( GI ) surgery ( except appendectomy cholecystectomy three month prior study ) condition investigator considers sufficiently significant interfere conduct , completion , result trial constitute unacceptable risk subject . Haemoglobin value &lt; 12.9g/dL male &lt; 11.4g/dL female . A past history current symptom significant hepatic renal disease , pancreatitis acute cholecystitis investigator considers sufficiently significant interfere conduct , completion , result trial constitute unacceptable risk subject .

Evidence current significant infection ( e.g . spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , pneumonia etc. ) . Subjects develop symptoms infection haemorrhage screen dosing must include study . Fluctuating rapidly deteriorate hepatic function ( , limit , rapidly increase ascites , rapidly deteriorate mental status , deteriorate hepatic function base prothrombin time [ PT ] , albumin , total bilirubin ) . Assessment stability subject 's hepatic function discretion Principal Investigator . Subjects significant renal insufficiency define estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min , use Cockcroft Gault equation .
