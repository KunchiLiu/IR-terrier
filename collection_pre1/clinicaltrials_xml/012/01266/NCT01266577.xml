	<brief_summary>Background : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) widely use scanning technique obtain image human body evaluate activity brain . A particular MRI method call magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) use study brain chemistry well , may help researcher study new treatment psychiatric illness . Researchers interested improve current MRI MRS technique , well develop new MRI MRS techniques view measure brain chemical brain activity . Objectives : - To implement , develop , optimize brain chemistry image technique use magnetic resonance image magnetic resonance spectroscopy . Eligibility : - Healthy individual 18 65 year age . Design : - This study involve screen visit scan visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . - Participants screen full medical physical examination , blood urine test , neurological testing . - During second visit , participant MRI scan brain . ( Participants receive MRI within past year need second one ; image previous scan use study . ) All participant MRS scan use scan equipment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) identical MRI except metabolite signal , rather dominant water signal , measure . Proton ( 1H ) MRS phosphorous ( 31P ) MRS two powerful spectroscopy method measure metabolism vivo . By use water suppression technique , proton MRS monitor level important brain metabolite neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) , creatine , choline , lactate , myo-inositol , glutamate , glutamine , gamma aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , glutathione . 31P MRS utilized measure energy phosphate metabolites inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) , phosphocreatine ( PCr ) , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) brain muscle . In addition , phosphocholine ( PC ) , phosphoethanolamine ( PE ) , glycerophosphocholine ( GPC ) glyceophosphoethanolamine ( GPE ) also detect brain tissue . This protocol propose two main goal . First , implement optimize current proton 31P MRS method publish literature image metabolite human brain muscle . Second , develop new method use similar brain muscle MRS application . To develop optimize vivo MRS method , 150 healthy volunteer recruit period three year . The subject age 18-65 year , include representative number male , female , minority . The experiment perform GE 3T , Siemens 3T 7T MRI scanner locate NIH In Vivo NMR Research Center . In first portion study , clinical MRI perform ensure subject abnormal brain condition . In second portion study , MRS scan perform various system pulse parameter combination . No medication involve . Total scan time MRS scan one two hour long . We expect obtain high quality proton and/or phosphorous spectroscopy image healthy volunteer help establish accurate reliable spectroscopy method clinical investigator perform non-invasive study psychiatric , neurological disorder , disease human brain muscle .</detailed_description>
