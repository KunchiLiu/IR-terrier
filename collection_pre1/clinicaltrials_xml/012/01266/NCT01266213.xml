	<brief_summary>Fulvestrant ER antagonist agonist effect , bind , block degrade ER . Fulvestrant comparable third-generation aromatase inhibitor term efficacy tolerability patient progress prior tamoxifen therapy past study find three-third-generation AIs least good tamoxifen first-line metastatic therapy postmenopausal woman . Fulvestrant study little premenopausal woman despite attractive mechanism action . The clinical effectiveness fulvestrant treatment advance breast cancer previously demonstrate standard dose ( AD ; 250 mg/mo ) several phase III clinical trial postmenopausal woman . However , evidence suggest dose fulvestrant high 250 mg may great pharmacodynamic activity ER pathway . Moreover , dose-dependent clinical activity observe fulvestrant . The activity fulvestrant high-dose ( HD ; 500 mg/mo ) regimen investigate two recent study . A pilot Japanese study show fulvestrant HD clinical activity treatment advance recurrent breast cancer , well tolerate , result plasma level approximately double see fulvestrant low-dose . Subsequently , neoadjuvant study compare fulvestrant low-dose high-dose report significantly great Ki67 ER downregulation achieve high-dose compare low-dose regimen dose well tolerate . A recent randomized trial also show superior outcome high-dose fulvestrant AI . Based rationale , introduce high-dose fulvestrant LHRH agonist randomize trial comparing AI plus LHRH agonist LHRH alone premenopausal metastatic breast cancer patient fail tamoxifen treatment .</brief_summary>
