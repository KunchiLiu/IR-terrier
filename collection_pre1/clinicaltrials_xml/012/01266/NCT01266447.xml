	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial study well veliparib , topotecan hydrochloride , filgrastim pegfilgrastim work treat patient persistent recurrent cervical cancer . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell block divide . Giving veliparib chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . Filgrastim pegfilgrastim may cause body make blood cell help recover side effect chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib , Topotecan Hydrochloride , Filgrastim Pegfilgrastim Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate antitumor activity ( objective response rate RECIST 1.1 ) ABT-888 ( veliparib ) 10 mg administer orally twice day day 1 5 topotecan ( topotecan hydrochloride ) 0.6 mg/m^2 administer IV daily day 1 5 cycle patient persistent recurrent carcinoma cervix . II . To determine nature degree toxicity ABT-888 topotecan patient persistent recurrent carcinoma cervix . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration progression-free survival overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether evidence interaction exist study treatment tumor expression poly ( ADP-ribos ) ylation E2 protein , E6/E7 proteins , p53R2 relation progression-free overall survival metastasis . ( Translational ) II . To explore association methylation FanCF BRCA pre-treatment tumor sample pre- post-treatment biopsy sample response , progression-free overall survival patient , and/or metastasis . ( Translational ) OUTLINE : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily topotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute daily day 1-5 . Patients also receive , accord institutional standard , filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) begin day 6 , 7 , 8 continue hematopoietic recovery pegfilgrastim SC day 6 , 7 , 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue sample may collect periodically translational study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
