	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study Siltuximab Placebo Combination With Velcade Dexamethasone Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study experimental drug call siltuximab ( also know CNTO 328 ) . Siltuximab develop see may useful treat multiple myeloma , include multiple myeloma return ( relapse ) respond ( refractory ) previous treatment . Multiple myeloma type cancer affect blood bone marrow . The cancer cell bone marrow cause normal bone marrow cell breakdown . This result low level red blood cell ( may make patient feel tire fatigue ) , low level white blood cell ( may increase patient 's chance infection ) low level platelet ( may increase risk bleed ) . The cancer cell cause damage normal bone . This cause bone pain , bone fracture , increase level calcium blood . The cancer cell also make protein ( call M-proteins ) , result damage organ , especially kidney . Siltuximab chimeric ( part mouse part human ) antibody ( immunoglobulin important fight infection ) . Siltuximab block another small protein call Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) . The body make IL-6 naturally , normal level important inflammatory response . But high level IL-6 help cancer cell grow interfere chemotherapy drug kill cancer cell . Cancer-related sickness weight loss , bone weakening , depression link high level IL-6 . This study test effectiveness safety siltuximab take together Velcade dexamethasone . There two treatment group , Arm A Arm B . To try make sure group similar , patient put Arm A Arm B , randomly ( chance ) , like flip coin . Patients Arm A receive siltuximab plus Velcade dexamethasone . Patients Arm B receive placebo plus Velcade dexamethasone . About 500 patient participate study . Velcade , also know bortezomib , inject directly vein . This call intravenous ( IV ) push . Siltuximab placebo give 1 hour IV infusion small tube go directly vein . Dexamethasone give orally . The treatment period divide cycle last 21 day last patient 's multiple myeloma get bad , side effect acceptable happen patient decides withdraw consent treatment , whichever occur first . Siltuximab 11mg/kg placebo give Day 1 every cycle . Velcade 1.3 mg/m2 give Days 1 , 4 , 8 11 Cycles 1-8 , Days 1 8 Cycles 9 high . Dexamethasone 20 mg give day day Velcade dose . Safety assessment perform throughout study include obtain evaluate laboratory test , vital sign ( e.g . blood pressure ) , check occurrence severity adverse event . Disease assessment also perform include obtain evaluate blood 24 hour urine sample , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy sample clinical radiologic evaluation . After treatment , patient enter follow-up period , include visit 12 week last dose check every three month death end study . Patients stop treatment multiple myeloma get bad disease assessment disease get bad , start new multiple myeloma treatment , decide withdraw consent study participation end study , whichever happen first . Siltuximab placebo plus Velcade dexamethasone give 21-day treatment cycle worsen disease ( progression ) , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal consent treatment , whichever come first . Siltuximab 11 mg/kg placebo give Day 1 every cycle . Velcade 1.3 mg/m2 give Days 1 , 4 , 8 11 Cycles 1-8 , Days 1 8 Cycles 9 high . Dexamethasone 20 mg give day day Velcade dose .</detailed_description>
