	<detailed_description>This study design determine effect dairy-rich diet oxidative inflammatory stress metabolic syndrome patient presence absence obesity . Forty overweight obese subject ( BMI 25-39.9 ) metabolic syndrome define NCEP ATP III criterion randomize inadequate ( 0-0.5 daily serve ) adequate ( 3.5 serving ) dairy diet presence eucaloric weight maintenance diet 12 week . All subject undergo 14-day lead-in period establish stable baseline dietary physiological measure ( describe ) , follow 12-week intervention period . Baseline dietary assessment conduct project dietitian two-week lead-in period use provide initial estimate maintenance level caloric intake . This refine calculate energy need use DRI equation calculation age- physical activity ( PA ) adjust total energy expenditure ( TEE ) men woman . Energy requirement confirm via measurement rest metabolic rate via indirect calorimetry . Subjects give diet isocaloric consume lead-in period , macronutrient fiber level maintain equivalent level approximate estimate U.S. average ( described Diets section ) . Subjects inadequate dairy diet assign diet contain &lt; 600 mg Ca/day &lt; 0.5 daily serve dairy food , subject adequate dairy diet assign diet contain 1200 - 1400 mg Ca/day 3.5 daily serving dairy ( milk , yogurt , hard cheese ) . Two three dairy serving consume daily high dairy diet milk and/or yogurt ensure sufficient consumption whey protein . All subject provide individual instruction , counsel assessment study dietitian regard dietary adherence development reinforcement strategy continue success , diet monitor weekly . Physical activity assess use pedometer count maintain approximately pre-study level throughout study . Pedometer count record daily 14-day lead-in period value average provide pre-study baseline . Subjects ask maintain level activity ( plus minus 500 steps/day ) use pedometer self-assessment . Pedometer count record provide study staff weekly basis , along diet record . Body weight , waist circumference , blood pressure measure weekly body composition ( via dual X-ray absorptiometry ) measure week 0 , 4 12 dietary intervention . Resting metabolic rate respiratory quotient assess week 0 12 . Oxidative burden assess measurement plasma malonaldehyde , 8-isoprostane F2α oxidize LDL week 0 , 1 , 4 12 , inflammatory stress assess measurement IL-6 , IL-15 , MCP , C-reactive protein , adiponectin TNF-α level plasma time interval . Glucose tolerance , HOMAIR , fast plasma lipid , PTH 1,25- ( OH ) 2-D level determine time interval ( 0 , 4 , 12 week ) . All data analyze via two-factor multivariate analysis variance ( MANOVA ) .</detailed_description>
