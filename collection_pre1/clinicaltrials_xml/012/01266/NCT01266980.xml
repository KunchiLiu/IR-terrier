	<brief_title>A Study Assess Effects Repeat Doses Fluticasone Furoate GW642444M Combination Healthy Subjects Subjects With Severe Impairment .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized study ass pharmacokinetics safety follow 7 day daily dose inhaled FF/ GW642444M ( 200/25mcg ) subject renal impairment . Nine subject severe renal impairment ( define Clcr &lt; 30mL/min ) recruit along healthy control subject ( define Clcr &gt; 80mL/min match severe subject base gender , ethnicity , body mass index ( ±15 % ) age ( ±5 year ) ) . All subject receive fluticasone furoate 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg daily 7 day . The result study aid decide whether FF/GW642444M dose adjustment justified subject severe renal impairment estimate adjustment .</detailed_description>
