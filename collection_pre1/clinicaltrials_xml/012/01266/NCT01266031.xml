	<brief_title>Phase I/II Adaptive Randomized Trial Bevacizumab Versus Bevacizumab Plus Vorinostat Adults With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Glioblastoma ( GBM ) common primary brain tumor . With optimal treatment , consist focal radiotherapy concurrent chemotherapy , follow adjuvant chemotherapy , median survival 14.6 month . Most patient evidence tumor progression within one year diagnosis despite treatment . At progression , treatment option limit mostly ineffective . - Given importance angiogenesis GBM , anti-angiogenic therapy promising strategy recurrent GBM . Bevacizumab , first angiogenesis inhibitor approve cancer FDA base improved survival advance colon cancer patient , recently study GBM . - The present study aim determine potential vorinostat , HDAC inhibitor plus bevacizumab , versus bevacizumab alone , attempt increase anti-angiogenic effect VEGF block evasive resistance combination vorinostat also provide potential independent effect agent also potential synergy . Objectives - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) vorinostat plus bevacizumab adult patient malignant glioma . - To determine efficacy vorinostat plus bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone patient recurrent WHO grade IV glioma ( glioblastoma gliosarcoma ) determine progression free survival ( PFS ) use adaptive randomization phase II trial design . Eligibility - Patients must histologically prove glioblastoma , gliosarcoma anaplastic glioma eligible Phase I component protocol . Anaplastic glioma include anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( AO ) , anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma ( AMO ) , malignant glioma NOS ( otherwise specify ) . Patients eligible original histology low-grade glioma subsequent histological diagnosis malignant glioma make . Only patient histologically proven image proven recurrent glioblastoma gliosarcoma eligible Phase II component . - Patients must show unequivocal evidence tumor progression determine MRI scan do prior study entry review treat physician confirm document recurrence . - No prior treatment bevacizumab Vorinostat Design The phase I component assess MTD Vorinostat combination Bevacizumab . A conventional phase I design use MTD select use 3+3 accrual design dose level MTD determine . A maximum 18 patient recruit component study . The phase II component trial compare Bevacizumab Vorinostat+ Bevacizumab patient recurrent GBM . The primary outcome progression free survival . Patients randomize two arm use Bayesian adaptive algorithm . Patients randomize fairly two arm start trial ( first 20 patient ) . Thereafter , trial progress data accrue , randomization become unbalanced favor treatment , average , good result term failure time . Therefore , successive patient likely receive treatment well result , average . A minimum 20 maximum 90 patient accrue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients include study base follow criterion . Patients must histologically prove glioblastoma , gliosarcoma anaplastic glioma eligible Phase I component protocol . Anaplastic glioma include anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( AO ) , anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma ( AMO ) , malignant glioma NOS ( otherwise specify ) . Patients eligible original histology lowgrade glioma subsequent histological diagnosis malignant glioma make . Only patient histologically proven image proven recurrent glioblastoma gliosarcoma eligible Phase II component . Wafer acceptable recurrence confirm . All patient must sign informed consent indicate awareness investigational nature study . Patients must sign authorization release protect health information . Patients must 18 year old old . Patients must Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) equal great 60 At time registration : Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy &lt; grade 2 toxicity per CTC version 4 ( except deep vein thrombosis ) 1 . 28 day investigational agent , 2 . 4 week ( 28 day ) prior cytotoxic therapy , 3 . 2 week ( 14 day ) vincristine , 4 . 6 week ( 42 day ) nitrosoureas , 5 . 3 week ( 21 day ) procarbazine administration , 6. great equal to1 week ( 7 day ) noncytotoxic agent , e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc . ( radiosensitizer count ) . Patients receive anticancer agent nontherapeutic purpose unrelated study ( presurgically obtain pharmacology data agent ) eligible enter study provide recover toxic effect agent . Any question relate definition noncytotoxic agent direct Study Chair . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( ANC great equal 1,500/mm3 , platelet count great equal 100,000/mm3 ) , adequate liver function ( SGPT le equal 3 time upper limit normal alkaline phosphatase less equal 2 time upper limit normal , total bilirubin less equal 1.5mg/dl , Patients high bilirubin level relate know diagnosis benign hyperbilirubinemia ( Gilbert syndrome ) eligible . , adequate renal function ( BUN le equal 1.5 time institutional normal Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl ) prior registration . These test must perform within 14 day prior registration . Patients must show unequivocal evidence tumor progression determine MRI scan do prior study entry review treat physician confirm document recurrence . Patients prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation true progressive disease rather radiation necrosis use local institutional standard determination include advance imaging surgery . The baseline onstudy MRI scan perform within 14 day ( + 3 work day ) prior registration start treatment steroid dose stable decrease least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date imaging registration ( time ) , new baseline MRI require . The type scan , i.e. , MRI must use throughout period protocol treatment tumor measurement . Patients undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible long follow condition apply : 1 . At least 4 week ( 28 day ) elapse date surgery patient recover effect surgery . 2 . Evaluable measureable disease follow resection recurrent Malignant Glioma mandate eligibility study . 3 . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , MRI do later 96 hour immediate postoperative period least 4 week postoperatively , within 14 day prior registration . If 96hour scan 14 day registration , scan need repeat . If steroid dose increase date imaging registration , new baseline MRI require stable steroid dosage least 5 day . Patients must fail prior radiation therapy must interval great equal 12 week ( 84 day ) completion radiation therapy study entry except unequivocal evidence tumor recurrence ( histological confirmation advance image data PET scan ) case least 4 week ( 28 day ) completion radiation therapy suffice . Patients prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation true progressive disease rather radiation necrosis base upon either PET Thallium scanning , MR spectroscopy surgical/pathological documentation disease .
