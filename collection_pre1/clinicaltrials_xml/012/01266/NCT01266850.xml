	<brief_summary>Rotavirus , sometimes call `` stomach flu , '' common cause severe diarrhea child . Vaccines prevent many type infection work cause body make protein call antibody fight infection . For vaccine , one vaccination need body make enough antibody fight infection . The vaccine ( RotaTeq® Rotarix® oral vaccine ) give study recommend infant Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) . These vaccine require either 2 3 vaccination effective . Healthy infant 6 week 14 week , 6 day age Visit 1 participate 10-12 month . Study procedure include reaction assessment blood sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rotavirus common cause severe gastroenteritis among child . The purpose propose study determine non-inferiority safety 2 license rotavirus vaccine administer child sequential vaccination . Both Rotarix® RotaTeq® vaccine evaluate safety efficacy placebo-controlled trial 70,000 infant likely vaccine deliver various combination safe effective . Since RotaTeq® license United States ( US ) 2006 , approximately 6 million dos administer US . In addition , Rotarix® license 100 nation worldwide deliver many child Latin America recommend universal vaccination 2 year . Now RotaTeq® Rotarix® license US , expect health care provider administer vaccine . A 3-dose regimen recommend RotaTeq® 2-dose regimen Rotarix® . From previous experience , likely one vaccine may become unavailable period pediatric office may switch one vaccine . Thus , probable mixed schedule administer infant . The primary objective determine proportion seroresponders sequential mixed rotavirus vaccine group ( RotaTeq® Rotarix® ) non-inferior proportion seroresponders recommend schedule single vaccine alone group . Secondary Objectives : determine neutralize rotavirus antibody responses common rotavirus serotypes ( G1-G4 G9 ) 3-6 week last vaccination sequential , mixed rotavirus vaccine schedule single rotavirus vaccine recommend schedule ; determine sequential mixed rotavirus vaccine schedule safe statistically significant increase fever , diarrhea , vomit , intussusception mixed schedule group compare recommended schedule single vaccine alone group . Normal healthy full-term infant schedule receive routine infant immunization least 6 week age 14 week , 6 day age Visit 1 recruit primary care clinic . Infants randomize ( open label ) one 5 different rotavirus vaccine study group . Two study group administer standard RotaTeq® Rotarix® vaccines 3 2 dos , respectively , 3 study group administer mixed sequence RotaTeq® Rotarix® give 3 dos . All rotavirus vaccine administer concurrently routinely administer childhood vaccine . Parents/legal guardian give memory aid thermometer , ask record suspect fever ( measured temperature document ) adverse event Days 1-8 vaccination . At approximately 1 week vaccination , study personnel contact parents/legal guardian , review complete memory aid , record finding case report form . Blood immunogenicity test obtain 3-6 week last dose vaccine . For four 3-dose rotavirus vaccine study group , blood obtain approximately 7 month age ( 3-6 week last rotavirus vaccine dose ) . For single Rotarix® vaccine study group , blood obtain approximately 5 month age ( 3-6 week last dose Rotarix® vaccine ) . The primary analysis base rate induction anti-rotavirus serum immunoglobulin ( Ig ) A 5 study group 3-6 week</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female infant least 6 week age 14 week , 6 day age Visit 1 . Parent ( ) /legal guardian ( ) sign informed consent document . Children available entire study period whose parents/legal guardian reach telephone . Healthy infant determine medical history baseline physical examination clinically significant abnormal finding within 14 day first dose . Parents/legal guardian able complete relevant study procedure study participation . Any clinically significant history gastrointestinal disease include abdominal surgery liver disease serious medical condition determine site investigator . Any history immunodeficiency infant ( e.g. , infant know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive , hypogammaglobulinemia , underlie malignancy ) , infant unvaccinated household contact immunocompromised : Any malignancy otherwise immunocompromised ; Primary immunodeficiency ; Receiving immunosuppressive therapy . Known sensitivity vaccine component , latex Rotarix® applicator . Previous receipt rotavirus vaccine . Acute illness time vaccine administration , follow within past 48 hour : 1 . Axillary temperature 100.4 degree Fahrenheit high , 2 . More 3 grossly watery stool , 3 . Any episode vomiting ( forceful expulsion partially digest milk/food ) . Infants previous diagnosis gastroesophageal reflux whose regurgitation episodes change 48hour period prior first vaccination may enrol . If symptom clear within 48 hour subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , subject may enrol . The subject currently participate study involve experimental agent ( vaccine , drug , biologic , device , blood product , medication ) receive experimental agent within 1 month prior enrollment study , expect receive another experimental agent participation study . Less 37 week gestation birth . Receipt blood and/or blood product ( include immunoglobulin ) within 4 week vaccine administration . Receipt live vaccine within past 30 day nonreplicating , inactivate , subunit vaccine within last 14 day , although plan license trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine may administer child 6 month age routine clinic visit permit would exclusionary . The subject condition would , opinion site investigator , place subject unacceptable risk injury render subject unable meet requirement protocol .</criteria>
