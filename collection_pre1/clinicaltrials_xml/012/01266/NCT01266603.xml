	<brief_title>High-dose Interleukin-2 ( HDIL-2 ) , Combined With recMAGE-A3 + AS15 ASCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : HDIL-2 similar hormone naturally find body boost immune system help `` natural killer '' ( NK ) cell live long work well . NK cell type white blood cell kill cell , may kill cancer cell . ASCI immunotherapy design teach immune system fight cancer way give vaccine prevent disease teach immune system fight infection cause germ . Because cancer make body , immune system recognize cancer cell harmful . Your immune system need `` trained '' recognize cancer cell . This do injecting protein ( MAGE-A3 protein ) find tumor training body recognize destroy cell protein . This may increase effectiveness IL-2 slow growth cancer cell , may cause die . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , begin study drug within 14 day sign second consent form . To receive study drug , admit hospital , either intensive care unit ( ICU ) specifically designate nursing unit study drug administer , Day 2 cycle may remain hospital 7 day cycle . You may receive total 24 ASCI dos either combination HDIL-2 alone . You may receive study drug combination 30 week . After , may receive ASCI study medication alone 176 week . Cycle 1 14 day ( Weeks 1 2 ) : - On Day 1 Cycle 1 , receive ASCI study medication injection . Each injection give muscle upper arm thigh .

HDIL-2 treatment delay cycle 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 HDIL-2 related side effect either go away study doctor think control . Cycle 2 42 day ( Weeks 3-8 ) : - On Day 1 Weeks 3 , 5 , 7 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive ASCI study medication injection . - On Day 2 Week 3 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive HDIL-2 vein . Cycle 3 14 day ( Weeks 9 10 ) : - On Day 1 Week 9 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive ASCI study medication injection . - On Day 2 Week 9 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive HDIL-2 vein . Cycle 4 49 day ( Weeks 11-17 ) : - On Day 1 Weeks 11 15 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive ASCI study medication injection . - On Day 2 Week 11 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive HDIL-2 vein . Cycle 5 21 day ( Weeks 18-20 ) : - On Day 1 Week 18 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive ASCI study medication injection . - On Day 2 Week 18 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive HDIL-2 vein . Cycle 6 42 day ( Weeks 21-26 ) : - On Day 1 Weeks 18 , 21 , 24 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive ASCI study medication injection . - On Day 2 Weeks 18 21 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive HDIL-2 vein . Cycle 7 21 day ( Weeks 27-29 ) : - On Day 1 Week 27 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive ASCI study medication injection . - On Day 2 Week 27 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive HDIL-2 vein . Cycle 8 28 day ( Weeks 30-33 ) : - On Day 1 Week 30 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive ASCI study medication injection . - On Day 2 Week 30 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive HDIL-2 vein . On Day 1 Weeks 34 , 40 , 46 , 52 , 64 , 76 , 88 , 100 ( +/- 2 business day ) , receive ASCI study medication injection . Study Visits : On Day 1 Weeks 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 , 27 , 30 ( +/- 2 business day ) : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You ask side effect may drug take . On Day 2 Weeks 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 18 , 21 , 27 , 30 ( +/- 2 business day ) : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You ask side effect may drug take . During Weeks 8 , 17 , 26 , 33 , 39 , 51 , 63 , 75 , 87 , 99 , 123 , 147 , 171 , 195 ( +/- 1 week ) : - You CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - You also MRI scan CT scan brain check status disease . - You photograph lesion take indicated doctor . On Day 1 Weeks 34 , 40 , 46 , 52 , 64 , 76 , 88 , 100 , 124 , 148 , 172 , 196 ( +/- 2 business day ) : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You ask side effect may drug take . Additional Blood Draws : Additional blood ( 4 tablespoon time ) drawn laboratory test look study drug combination may affect immune system . These blood draw collect Day 1 cycle 1 cycle 1 48 hour last dose IL-2 . Additional blood draw ( 4 tablespoon time ) also Part blood drawn test send GSK Biologicals ( contracted laboratory ) testing . Length Study : You may continue receive study drug combination 8 cycle ( 33 week ) ASCI alone 76 week ( +/- 2 business day ) . If continue beyond complete 8 cycle HDIL-2 , receive ASCI Day 1 ( +/- 2 business day ) every 6 week 4 dos ( week 34 , 50 , 46 , 52 ) , Day 1 ( +/- 2 business day ) every 12 week ( week 64 , 76 , 98 , 110 ) 4 dos , Day 1 ( +/- 2 business day ) every 24 week ( week 134 , 158 , 182 , 206 ) 4 dos . You take study therapy early disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , study doctor think best interest . If remove study intolerable side effect , follow weekly either phone call clinic visit side effect tolerable . End-of-Dosing Visit : After receive last dose study drug combination , end-of-dosing visit : - Your medical history review asked side effect may drug take . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test ANA test . Follow-Up Visits : You follow-up visit last dose study drug , disease get bad . Starting last dose study drug , 1 visit every 3 month 1st year , every 4 month 2nd year , every 6 month 3rd 4th year , year 10 year ( +/- 2 business day ) . At visit , follow perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If study doctor think need , chest x-ray , CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis , and/or MRI scan CT scan brain check status disease . If disease begin get bad , information status health collect every 2 month . If able come clinic complete visit , ask information phone . The phone call last 10-15 minute time . Other Information : If time study disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , and/or study doctor think best interest , study treatment may stop temporarily . If study doctor stop treatment , may eligible start treatment study doctor think disease stop get bad and/or side effect control base result image scan photograph take study visit . This investigational study . IL-2 commercially available FDA approve treatment metastatic melanoma . HDIL-2 high dose standard approve dose IL-2 . The ASCI study medication FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
