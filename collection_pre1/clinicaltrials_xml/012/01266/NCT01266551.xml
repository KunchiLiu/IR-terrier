	<brief_summary>What 's know ? Prone position longer treatment option GERD association SIDS . Originally , position infant seat recommend infant GERD . However , Orenstein prove position detrimental effect GER , compare prone positioning . What 's new ? Positioning infant seat cause increase GER , compare supine 15 degree anti-Trendelenburg position . Except number long reflux episode , significantly high car safety seat . Larger trial need decisive conclusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE - Over past decade , increase gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) see infant . This increase may due continuous growth use car safety seat . The objective study evaluate hypothesis compare position car safety seat supine 15 degree anti-Trendelenburg position . PATIENTS AND METHODS - From October 2008 till August 2010 crossover , randomize , control trial perform 31 infant , age two week six month old , suspected GERD . Twenty hour continuous esophageal pH monitoring use compare position . RESULTS - The result trial demonstrate difference position car safety seat supine 15 degree anti-Trendelenburg position reflux index , duration long reflux episode number reflux episode ( PRI = NS ; PLRE = NS respectively PNRE = NS ) . Only difference number reflux episodes lasting longer five minute significant ( PNRE5 = 0,05 ) . CONCLUSIONS - The result study suggest increase GERD cause grow use car safety seat infant . As sample size limit , large trial need .</detailed_description>
