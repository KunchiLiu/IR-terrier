	<brief_title>TKI 258 Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome ( VHL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Dovitinib design perform several anti-tumor function , include cut blood supply tumor . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take 5 dovitinib capsule mouth day Days 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 28-day cycle . You take dovitinib capsule cup ( 8 ounce ) water least 1 hour breakfast least 2 hour follow breakfast . If side effect drug , tell study doctor right away . The study doctor may lower dose keep dose level . If miss dose dovitinib Days 1-4 ( 8-11 , 15-18 , 22-25 ) , make dose day . You continue take drug schedule following day . If miss dose Day 5 ( 12 , 19 , 26 ) , skip dose , rest 2 day , begin dose schedule Day 8 ( 15 , 22 , 1 next cycle ) . The study doctor tell additional step take miss dose . Every 4 week study call study `` cycle . '' Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , ECG . On Day 14 ( +/- 3 day ) Cycles 1 2 : -Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This blood testing may do local doctor 's office fax MD Anderson . You provide instruction fax laboratory test result . On Day 1 Cycles 3 Beyond ( +/- 3 day ) , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 8 week ( +/- 3 day ) : - Any change medical history since last visit record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask drug treatment may receive . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect since last visit . At End Cycles 2 4 : - You CT scan MRI scan check status disease . - If doctor know suspect VHL affect eye , eye exam . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long benefit . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Early Withdrawal /End Treatment Visit : - About 30 day stop take study drug , follow procedure : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug treatment may receive . - You ask side effect may since last visit . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You CT scan MRI scan check status disease . - If doctor know suspect VHL affect eye , eye exam . About 24 week last dose study drug , follow procedure : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You follow-up image scan check status disease . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - You ask drug treatment may receive . - You ask side effect may since last visit . This investigational study . Dovitinib FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 25 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must genetically confirm Von HippelLindau ( VHL ) disease patient clinical diagnosis VHL . 2 . At least one follow measurable hemangioblastomas undergo surveillance patient immediate risk need intervention lesion . . ) Brain : asymptomatic hemangioblastoma , &gt; 0.5 cm ; b . ) Spine : asymptomatic hemangioblastoma , &gt; 0.5 cm ; c. ) Renal : solid mass suspicious RCC &gt; /=1 cm cystic mass &gt; /=1 cm ; d. ) Pancreas : solid mass &gt; /=1cm &lt; 3 cm suspicious neuroendocrine tumor ; e. ) Eye : asymptomatic peripapillary and/or macular hemangioblastoma , size f. Adrenal : Pheochromocytoma great 1cm size . NOTE : Biopsy require give known natural history set positive genetic test . 3 . Allowable prior therapy : . ) Patients undergone prior therapy VHL lesion may enroll long criteria met . Previously radiate lesion may consider target lesion unless demonstrate unequivocal evidence growth ; b . ) Major surgery , chemotherapy radiation therapy complete &gt; 4 week prior start study treatment . 4 . Age &gt; /= 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use dovitinib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric singleagent trial , applicable 5 . ECOG performance status &lt; /= 2 6 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : . ) Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [ SGPT ] ) &lt; /=2.5 x local laboratory upper limit normal ( ULN ) due underlying malignancy ; b . ) Total serum bilirubin &lt; /=1.5 x ULN ; c. ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1500/mcL ; d. ) Platelets &gt; /=100,000/mcL ; e. ) Hemoglobin &gt; /= 9.0 g/dL ; f. ) Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN ; g ) WBC &gt; /= 3,000/mcl 7 . Males ( sterilize ) female childbearing potential ( female amenorrheic least 1 year surgically sterilize ) must agree use doublebarrier birth control abstinence protocol treatment 8 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior start study treatment recover ( &lt; /= Grade 1 ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 3 . Patients metastatic disease kind . 4 . NCI CTCAE grade 3 hemorrhage within 4 week start study treatment . 5 . Any follow within 6 month prior study drug administration : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism . 6 . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE grade &gt; /= 2 . 7 . Prolonged QTc interval baseline EKG &gt; 470ms . 8 . Hypertension control medication ( &gt; 140/90 mm Hg despite optimal medical therapy ) . 9 . LVEF assess 2D echocardiogram ( ECHO ) &lt; 50 % low limit normal ( whichever high ) multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) &lt; 45 % low limit normal ( whichever high ) . 10 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 11 . Pregnant woman exclude study dovitinib potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother dovitinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated dovitinib . 12 . Known HIVpositive patient take combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction dovitinib . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . 13 . Women childbearing potential , biologically able conceive , employ two form highly effective contraception . Highly effective contraception ( e.g . male condom spermicide , diaphragm spermicide , intrauterine device ) must use sex study must continue 8 week end study treatment . Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . Women childbearing potential , define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( e.g. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) , must negative serum pregnancy test &lt; /= 14 day prior start study treatment .</criteria>
