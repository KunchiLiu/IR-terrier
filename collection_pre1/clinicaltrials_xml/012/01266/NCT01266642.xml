	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Hypofractionated Whole Breast Irradiation Versus Conventionally Fractionated Whole Breast Irradiation Ductal Carcinoma Situ Early Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Questionnaire Photographs : If agree take part study , complete questionnaires general health breast currently look feel . This take 15 minute complete . Photographs also take breast doctor rate way breast look begin receive radiation . You able identify photograph . The photograph keep part medical record . You also physical exam medical history record . Study Groups : You randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . Group 1 receive short radiation . Group 2 receive standard radiation . For short radiation ( Group 1 ) , receive 3 week radiation ( 16 treatment ) entire breast . You also 4-5 additional treatment radiation `` boost '' . The boost deliver part breast disease first start . For standard radiation ( Group 2 ) , receive 5 week radiation ( 25 treatment ) entire breast . You also 5-7 additional treatment radiation boost part breast disease start . Study Visits : While receive radiation , ask side effect may week . Follow-up Visit : You return clinic follow-up visit 6 month 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year finish receive radiation . At follow-up visit , fill study questionnaire , photograph take breast , ask side effect may . You also physical exam medical history record . Length Study : After 5-year follow-up visit , study . This investigational study . Both standard short radiation course FDA-approved patient breast cancer . The goal study compare 2 treatment . Up 288 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Pathologically confirm ductal carcinoma situ breast early invasive breast cancer define pathologic stage Tis , T1 , T2 , N0 , N1mic , N1a ( pathologic stag axilla require patient invasive disease require patient DCIS ) . ( Upfront pathologic stage assign patient treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy . For patient , criterion pathologic stage shall apply initial clinical stage ) 2 . Treatment breast conserve surgery . 3 . Final surgical margin must negative , define evidence ductal carcinoma situ invasive breast cancer touch inked surgical margin . If invasive situ breast cancer approach within less 1 mm final surgical margin , reexcision strongly encourage . Lobular carcinoma situ final surgical margin disregard . 4 . Age 40 year old . This age cutoff justify breast cancer woman age 40 know significantly high risk IBTR presumably due underlie biologic difference . 5 . Female sex . 6 . Attending radiation oncologist declare intention treat whole breast third radiation field treat regional lymph node plan ( radiation undissected level I/II axilla high tangent allow ) . 7 . If patient history prior nonbreast cancer , treatment cancer must complete prior study registration patient must evidence disease prior nonbreast cancer . 8 . Patients must enrol trial within 12 week later two date : final breast conserve surgical procedure administration last cycle cytotoxic chemotherapy . 1 . Pathologic clinical evidence stage T3 T4 breast cancer . 2 . Pathologic evidence involvement 4 axillary lymph node , image evidence involvement infraclavicular , supraclavicular , internal mammary lymph node . 3 . Clinical pathologic evidence distant metastasis . 4 . Any prior diagnosis invasive ductal carcinoma situ breast cancer either breast . 5 . Current diagnosis bilateral breast cancer . 6 . History therapeutic irradiation breast , low neck , mediastinum area could potentially overlap affected breast . 7 . Patients fluent English Spanish . ( The Informed Consent available two language ) 8 . Patient pregnant .</criteria>
