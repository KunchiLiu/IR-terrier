	<brief_summary>This study aim identify woman risk low blood pressure ( hypotension ) usual cesarean anesthetic - spinal anesthetic . Hypotension may cause dehydration . We believe predict get hypotension use two anesthesia monitor together passive leg raise ( PLR ) ( legs elevate period spend recline ) . The PLR cause shift blood legs heart , monitor detect heart 's response tell subject dehydrate . We want see dehydration test also predict hypotension spinal anesthetic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We aim predict development spinal anesthesia relate hypotension subject already receive prophylactic infusion phenylephrine ( PE ) cesarean delivery ( CD ) . Hypotension arise fashion may signify subject actually relatively fluid-deplete , might benefit intravenous ( IV ) fluid replacement . We observe association hypotension result pre-anesthesia test two non-invasive monitor use conjunction dynamic cardiovascular fluid challenge ( use passive leg raise ( PLR ) maneuver ) . The use therapeutic intervention fluid infusion would object subsequent study . We propose minority parturients present elective CD relatively fluid deplete . It hypothesis characteristic passive leg raise ( PLR ) induce change plethysmography variability index ( PVI generate Masimo Radical 7™ ) cardiac output ( CO derive Non Invasive Cardiac Output Monitor ( NICOM ) produce Cheetah Medical™ ) identify subject without large volume fluid administration likely develop hypotension despite use prophylactic PE infusion Justification : Hypotension common cause spinal anesthesia relate morbidity cesarean delivery . Hypotension common without treatment affect 80 % woman . The mechanism usually twofold : Firstly preload right ventricle ( RV ) reduce result venodilation spinal sympathetic blockade . Unfortunately attempt improve preload infusion IV fluid alone n't make much difference rate hypotension ( 16 % reduction one large study ) . The second mechanism result afterload reduction arterial vasodilation directly cause reduction blood pressure ( BP ) . The treatment commonly PE infusion , use make significant difference reduce rate 50 % . Unfortunately n't seem respond ( residual hypotension remain 30 % ) . Increasing dos PE increase rate side effect , without affect hypotension rate . However , give fluid PE infusion seem prevent hypotension almost subject , suggest resistant PE alone actually need fluid . These subject however exception rule , give fluid relatively `` fluid deplete '' well rest may result increase fluid related side effect . We believe fluid therapy could tailor good could identify subject actually fluid deplete first instance . Testing predict fluid responsiveness study intensive care unit ( ICU ) obstetric subject . Using PLR increase return blood right ventricle ( RV ) . In fluid deplete individual significantly improve venous return CO change dramatically . In well hydrate individual venous return already adequate change CO le . The NICOM directly detect CO change induce PLR . The Masimo detects variation pulse oximetry plethysmograph trace result subtle variation cardiac output cause change intrathoracic pressure breathing . Intrathoracic pressure increase expiration spontaneously breathe subject cause reduction venous return RV cause subsequent fall CO . The variation plethysmography signal respiration display percentage index baseline signal strength correlate much venous return RV affect respiration . If subject 's preload low plethysmography variability index ( PVI ) high dramatic fluctuation CO change intrathoracic pressure . Unfortunately spontaneously breathe subject value consistent enough individual PVI give accurate indication fluid volume state . However change induce PVI within individual subject challenge fluid infusion PLR appear well indicate fluid responsiveness . We plan use NICOM Masimo conjunction PLR ass fluid state ( deplete otherwise ) preoperatively . We observe whether pre-anesthesia test correlate development PE infusion resistant hypotension routine spinal anesthetic . The primary objective study correlate result pre-anesthesia test actual development PE infusion resistant hypotension . Secondary outcome discuss statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
