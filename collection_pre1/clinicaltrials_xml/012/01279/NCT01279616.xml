	<brief_summary>Majority patient eligible allogeneic HSCT cure severe sickle cell disease lack match family donor . This study aim cure sickle cell disease perform unrelated donor ( outside family ) allogeneic HSCT . Donors unrelated cord blood unit select NMDP database . It design estimate safety novel reduce toxicity , yet immunosuppressive myeloablative preparative regimen . This meant patient &lt; 21 year old severe complication sickle cell match sibling donor family undergo stem cell transplant . Patients undergo transplant use unrelated donor stem cell receive protocol therapy . They follow 1 year monitor engraftment donor cell complication like graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , infection death .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Reduced Toxicity Allogeneic Unrelated Donor Stem Cell Transplantation ( SCT ) Severe Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal pilot study determine safety feasibility preparative regimen HSCT use novel reduce toxicity regimen stem cell transplant unrelated donor . Analysis gear confirm study regimen , follow appropriately HLA-matched unrelated donor ( MUD ) unrelated cord blood HSCT , lead durable donor engraftment reasonable toxicity , inhibit sickle erythropoiesis limit disease relate organ toxicity patient high risk morbidity mortality associate sickle cell disease ( SCD ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must sickle cell disease ( genotype Hb SS Sß° thalassemia ) , AND must 1 follow clinical complication relate Sickle cell disease : 1 . A clinically significant neurologic event ( stroke ) neurologic defect last &gt; 24 hour , accompany infarct cerebral MRI . 2 . Minimum two episode acute chest syndrome ( defined new pulmonary alveolar consolidation involve least 1 complete lung segment associate acute symptom include fever , chest pain , tachypnea , wheeze cough ) despite adequate supportive care measure ( example : asthma therapy , hydroxyurea ) . 3 . History severe pain episode define 3 severe pain event per year 2 year prior enrollment despite adequate supportive care measure hydroxyurea trial ( i.e . Hydroxyurea nonresponders ) . Pain may occur typical site associate vasoocclusive painful event explain cause vasoocclusion mediate sickle cell disease . 4 . Recurrent priapism . 5 . Osteonecrosis multiple joint 6 . Evidence Pulmonary Hypertension evidence Tricuspid Regurgitation jet velocity ( TRV ) &gt; 2.5 m/s Echocardiogram . 7 . Red cell alloimmunization ( ≥ 2 antibody ) long term transfusion therapy . 1 . Invasive bacterial , viral fungal infection within 1 month prior start condition therapy . 2 . Female patient Pregnant ( Beta HCG + ) breastfeeding . 3 . HIV positive patient . 4 . Patients HLAmatched related family donor eligible study . 5 . Prior myeloablative allogeneic HCT . 6 . Patients chronic transfusion therapy ≥ 1 year evidence cirrhosis liver biopsy 7 . Any significant concurrent disease , illness , severe cognitive delay psychiatric disorder would compromise patient safety compliance , interfere consent , study participation , follow , interpretation study result .</criteria>
