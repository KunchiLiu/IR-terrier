	<brief_summary>This two-part , Phase 1 , open-label , multicenter , dose escalation study KHK2866 monotherapy patient advance solid tumor , combination chemotherapy subject platinum-sensitive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Anti-HB-EGF Antibody KHK2866 Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During Phase 1a , group eligible patient advance solid tumor receive KHK2866 monotherapy escalate dos . The Phase 1b portion enroll patient ovarian cancer receive KHK2866 combination one three chemotherapy regimen ( Arms ) : gemcitabine+carboplatin ( platinum-sensitive , weekly paclitaxel ( platinum-resistant ) , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( platinum-resistant ) . Escalating dos combination KHK2866 chemotherapy regimen give two group subject per Arm . The goal study learn side effect KHK2866 alone give combination chemotherapy . All subject receive study therapy 6 cycle ( 12 cycle subject assign PLD [ Arm 3 Phase 1b ] ) , disease progression , development severe side effect , noncompliance withdrawal consent subject , removal criterion whichever come first .</detailed_description>
