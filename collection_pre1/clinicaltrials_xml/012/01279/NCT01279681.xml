	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab without oxaliplatin work treat old patient colorectal cancer spread place body . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Bevacizumab may also stop growth cancer block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab effective without oxaliplatin treat colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Bevacizumab With Without Oxaliplatin Treating Older Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) elderly patient metastatic colorectal carcinoma randomize receive fluoropyrimidine ( fluorouracil ) -based therapy plus bevacizumab , without oxaliplatin . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . In prospectively plan pool analysis similar trial conduct Japanese Clinical Oncology Group ( JCOG ) , evaluate compare overall survival ( OS ) elderly patient metastatic colorectal carcinoma randomize receive fluoropyrimidine-based therapy plus bevacizumab , without oxaliplatin . II . To assess compare response rate adverse event elderly patient metastatic colorectal carcinoma randomize receive fluoropyrimidine-based therapy plus bevacizumab , without oxaliplatin . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group base physician decision fluoropyrimidine . ARM A1 : Patients receive fluorouracil intravenously ( IV ) 46-48 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , bevacizumab IV 10-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM A2 : Patients receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group base physician decision fluoropyrimidine . Arm B1 : Patients receive mFOLFOX7 comprise oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46-48 hour day 1 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 10-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm B2 : Patients receive XELOX comprise oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 capecitabine PO BID day 1-14 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
