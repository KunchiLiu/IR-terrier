	<brief_summary>In study support American Cancer Society grant , investigator evaluate two level swallow exercise intensity maintenance swallow muscle function Head/Neck cancer patient undergo radiotherapy . Patients study randomly place different exercise group provide exercise perform daily radiation treatment . Their progress , diet management swallow ability monitor throughout treatment period follow 3 month radiation treatment . In addition daily treatment detail , patient perception swallow ability concern health treatment also measure . This clinical trial help refine previously investigate simple exercise package provide program intervention help prevent medically related complication swallow difficulty ( e.g . pneumonia , dehydration , prolong tube feeding ) , improve ability eat patient head / neck cancer . Ultimately hop form exercise therapy help reduce cost ( personal financial ) patient , caregiver community .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharyngocise Dose Response Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In early pilot study , regime simple swallow exercise identify useful maintain oropharyngeal muscle characteristic measure T2 weight Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) produce trend toward improved function swallow patient undergo radiotherapy head neck cancer . The purpose current study evaluate dose response two level swallow exercise intensity maintenance muscle composition function swallow Head/Neck cancer patient undergo radiotherapy . HYPOTHESIS : A program intensive swallow exercise ( Pharyngocise ) maintain muscle function oral cavity pharynx radiotherapy , preserve support swallow function Head/Neck cancer patient . STUDY DESIGN : 130 patient Head/Neck cancer , confirm clinical history exam , recruit 4 year period . All subject undergo initial baseline work , include standardized clinical instrumental swallow evaluation , psychosocial scale , nutritional exam , T2 weight MRI prior first radiation therapy . Subjects randomize 1 3 group : Group A : Usual care ( control ) group - patient receive swallow prescribe dietary intervention radiotherapy period prescribe attend physician . Group B : High intensity pharyngocise treatment group - patient receive twice daily swallow intervention speech language pathologist , consist battery isometric/isotonic exercise . Group C : Low intensity pharyngocise treatment group - patient receive single instructional exercise session isometric/isotonic exercise Speech Language Pathologist practice tape support home practice exercise . All patient treat approximately 6 week follow 3 month post treatment . Baseline assessment repeat . In addition , daily treatment detail , patient perception current swallowing ability progress therapy record Speech Pathologist . Participants independently monitor throughout treatment period researcher blind treatment group assign , via weekly phone interview session . Compliance treatment technique , occurrence negative endpoint occurrence aspiration pneumonia record .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Head/Neck cancer oropharyngeal adjacent region , confirm clinical history exam , positive cross sectional imaging study histopathological biopsy exclude pathology . 2 . Planned external beam radiation therapy 3 . No previous history nonoral feeding cancer relate illness 4 . Able undergo MRI image scan 5 . Patient physician agreement enter study 1 . Planned extensive surgical intervention 2 . Existence coexist neurological medical disorder know cause dysphagia 3 . Prior radiotherapy surgery head / neck region could contribute dysphagia . 4 . Previous swallow therapy within four week randomization 5 . Gross tumor involvement oral pharyngeal muscle obviate adequate MRI measurement majority muscle interest .</criteria>
