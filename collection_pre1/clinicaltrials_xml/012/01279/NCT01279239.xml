	<detailed_description>Metabonomics set measurement dynamic metabolic response live system stimuli modification . This field study develop application nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy mass spectrometry tool study complex biofluids . Metabonomics one emerge field systemic biology research concerned high-throughput identification , quantification characterization small molecule metabolite . A metabonomics fingerprint define complete complement small molecule ( &lt; 1500 Da ) metabolites find specific cell , body fluid , organ organism . Severe poly trauma involves complex injury consist multiple pathological mechanism involve cytotoxic , oxidation stress immune-endocrine . The complexity pathological physiology biochemistry process determine initial mechanical assault , also secondary process include abnormality inflammation regulation , ischemia , anoxia , free-radical formation , immune dysfunction occur hour day follow injury . For clinical perspective , one key difficulty identify at-risk patient could develop multiple organ failure consequently death . This study aim establish dynamic NMR-based metabonomics fingerprint severe multi-trauma patient order provide possible multiple organ failure ( MOF ) death event prediction .</detailed_description>
