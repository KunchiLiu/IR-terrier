	<brief_title>Metformin Versus Acarbose Treatment Infertile Overweight Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ( PCOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomize clinical trial compare endocrine metabolic effect two anti diabetic drug ( metformin vs. acarbose ) infertile overweight woman PCOS . Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) characterize menstrual irregularity , hyperandrogenism , chronic anovulation enlarge ovary twelve peripherally locate follicle less 10 mm diameter . Hyperinsulinemia one diagnostic feature PCOS patient PCOS find resistance either endogenous exogenous insulin . Different insulin sensitize drug use improvement hyperinsulinemia PCOS subject . Metformin ( N dimethyl-biguanide ) anti diabetic drug increase glucose utilization insulin sensitive tissue . Acarbose alfa-Glycosidase inhibitor act slow absorption carbohydrate intestine , prevents Glucosidase activity brush-border intestinal mucosa , decrease disaccharide digestion , reduce enteric monosaccharide absorption , minimize postprandial rise blood glucose concentration . The aim present study compare endocrine metabolic effect two antidiabetic drug ( metformin vs. acarbose ) infertile overweight woman PCOS . The study population comprises infertile patient diagnosis polycystic ovarian syndrome overweight ( BMI &gt; 25Kg/m2 ) . The PCO subject recognize base Rotterdam criterion inclusive 1 ) irregular menstruation , 2 ) clinical /or biochemical sign hyperandrogenism , 3 ) polycystic ovary ( presence 12 follicle ovary measure 2-9 mm diameter , /or increase ovarian volume great 10 ml ) . Diagnosis PCOS confirm presence two three criterion beside infertility . In study eligible patient randomly allocate two study group computerize randomization method : Acarbose group treat acarbose ( dose 100 mg/day first week , 200 mg/ day second week 300 mg/ day next 10 week ) . Metformin group receive metformin . The metformin dose 500 mg/ day first week , 1000 mg/ day second week 1500 mg/ day next 10 week . Data collection perform use questionnaire fill per available record laboratory result . This study accomplish Royan Institute 50 PCO patient ( 25 patient group ) continuous sample method apply . Data analysis do descriptive perceptive statistical method use SPSS software version 15 window .</detailed_description>
