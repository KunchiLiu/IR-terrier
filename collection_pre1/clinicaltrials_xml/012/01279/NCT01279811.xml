	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . Measure pressure spinal fluid surround spinal cord find well spinal cord supply blood . 2 . Determine drug call `` vasopressor '' , use control blood pressure follow SCI ( spinal cord injury ) , influence spinal fluid pressure . 3 . Characterize severity SCI use level specific proteins find within spinal fluid . 4 . Predict much neurologic recovery may regain use level specific protein within spinal fluid . 5 . Identify proteins within spinal fluid help u learn happen SCI assist u develop new treatment SCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research project consist two complementary yet distinct initiative : 1 . First , prospectively evaluate spinal cord perfusion pressure ( SCPP ) patient acute spinal cord injury , provide scientifically-based guideline management blood pressure acute injury phase . 2 . Second , evaluate cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sample patient goal prospectively validate series biochemical marker correlate injury severity predict neurologic outcome . Ultimately , goal enhance neurologic outcome individual spinal cord injury improve upon acute clinical care , establish biological surrogate injury severity may use facilitate clinical trial novel therapeutic intervention acute spinal cord injury . Specific Aims This multicenter study enroll patient acute traumatic cervical thoracic SCI within 48 hour injury . A lumbar intrathecal catheter insert pre-operatively measurement intrathecal pressure ( ITP ) collection CSF sample . Spinal cord perfusion pressure calculate difference mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) ITP . The objective aspect study : - Document change SCPP first 5-7 day post-injury ( intrathecal catheter place 5 day ) . - Determine effect different vasopressor agent SCPP . Additionally , CSF sample obtain intrathecal catheter 8-hour interval analyse expression follow biochemical marker : include interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-8 , monocyte chemo-attractant protein ( MCP ) -1 , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , S100beta , tau . The objective aspect study : - Evaluate accuracy inflammatory neuronal marker classify initial severity paralysis predict extent neurologic recovery . - Characterize temporal pattern expression protein provide complete description human pathophysiology SCI .</detailed_description>
