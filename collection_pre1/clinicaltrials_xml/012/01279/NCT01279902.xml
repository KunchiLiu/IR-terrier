	<brief_summary>This study aim ; assess efficacy shorten systemic chemotherapy patient completely excise CD20 positive Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) Ann Arbor Stage I II .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abbreviated R-CHOP Completely Excised Stage I II DLBCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unlike limited stage diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) treat primary chemotherapy follow radiotherapy , patient stage I II DLBCL would treat surgical resection follow chemotherapy trial . While chemotherapy main treatment modality radiotherapy become adjuvant treatment former treatment scheme , surgical resection remove gross lesion chemotherapy aim remove microscopic disease whichever exist latter treatment scheme . Currently , six cycle chemotherapy usually perform surgery even without residual lesion compare three cycle chemotherapy former treatment scheme play primary role treatment scheme . The investigator investigate whether abbreviated 3 cycle Rituximab Plus Cyclophosphamide , Adriamycin , Vincristine , Prednisolone ( R-CHOP ) immunochemotherapy follow complete resection effective safe treatment .</detailed_description>
