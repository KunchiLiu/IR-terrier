	<brief_title>Placement Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheters ( PICC ) Children Guided Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Peripherally inserted central venous catheter ( PICC ) increasingly use intravenous therapy wide variety adult pediatrics patient . Children may characteristics could compromise assertiveness catheter placement , even experience qualified professional . In order search method could lead nursing practice innovation seek good result placement PICC , study design analyze use Doppler vascular ultrasound ( DVUS ) PICC insertion perform nurse . Objective : To compare success peripheral intravenous puncture ( PIP ) , progression placement PICC child , accord use DVUS traditional method ; identify influence DUVS time expend placement PICC child . Methods : Clinical , randomize control trial conduct pediatric surgery ward university hospital , August 17th , 2007 August 19th , 2008 , ethical merit research endorsement obtain consent responsible child . The sample , calculate 42 PICC obtain power 0,85 , distribute randomly two group , experimental group ( EG ) control group ( CG ) . The dependent variable : success PIP , catheter progression placement . Variables related child IV therapy investigate . To statistical analyzes Pearson Chi-square , Fisher 's Exact Tests , Generalization Fischer 's Exact Mann-Whitney test apply ( significance level 5 % ) . Results : Of 42 catheter , 21 ( 50.0 % ) implement EG 21 ( 50.0 % ) CG . The PIP obtain first attempt 90.5 % puncture EG 47.6 % GC , ( p=0.003 ) puncture accomplished catheter insertion , despite number attempt 76.5 % EG 41.7 % GC ( p = 0.001 ) . The successful PICC progression marginally significant result ( p=0.069 ) , 69.2 % EG 44.0 % CG . PICC implant successfully 18 ( 85.7 % ) child GE 11 ( 61.1 % ) CG ( p = 0.019 ) . The median time spent procedure significantly high ( p=0.001 ) CG ( 50 minute ) compare EG ( median 20 minute ) . Conclusion : The result obtain lead conclusion use USVD implementation PICC child promote great success PIP PICC placement , reduce time spent procedure , significant influence observe regard catheter progression .</detailed_description>
