	<brief_title>Clozapine/Paliperidone Versus Clozapine/Placebo Resistant Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 12 week , blind study ( patient , investigator , sponsor know study drug dosage take patient ) safety tolerability flexible-dose ( 3 12mg per day ) , extended-release ( ER ) paliperidone combination clozapine diagnosis schizophrenia . Patients complete study discontinue study lack efficacy complete minimum 21 day study may enter study . This study consist 21-day screen washout phase ( discontinue `` wash '' medication allow study ) , double blind treatment phase 12 week , patient take oral paliperidone ER every day clozapine versus clozapine alone , post-treatment phase consist follow-up visit complete 1 week patient receive final dose paliperidone ER . The study , include screen posttreatment phase , last approximately 30 week . Screening washout may conduct patient outpatient . Safety assess laboratory measurement ( chemistry , liver function test , hematology , hormone , lipid assessment , prolactin [ blind ] , urinalysis , urine drug screen ; body weight , height , waist circumference measurement ; ECGs ESRS ( extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale ) . These instrument use assess extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) dyskinesia . Adverse event monitor include psychiatric adverse event interest ( worsen psychosis , hyperprolactinemia , weight gain ) may associate paliperidone ER population . The primary aim study evaluate long-term ( 12 week ) safety tolerability clozapine/paliperidone ER resistant schizophrenia . As exploratory secondary aim , study assess effect clozapine/paliperidone ER long-term symptom schizophrenia measure change Positive Negative Syndrome Scale Schizophrenia ( PANSS ) score , global improvement severity illness measure Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) scale . Patients begin study 6.0 mg/day oral paliperidone ER . If high dosage need , dosage increase ( increment 3 mg/day frequently every 5 day ) 12 mg/day . If 6.0 mg/day dosage well tolerate , dosage may decrease ( frequently every 5 day ) 3.0 mg/day . Patients dose 6 month .</detailed_description>
