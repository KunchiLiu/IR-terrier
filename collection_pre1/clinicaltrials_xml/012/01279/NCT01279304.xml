	<detailed_description>Primary systemic treatment breast cancer patient use give patient locally advanced disease . Although study report primary systemic treatment lead superior survival compare adjuvant chemotherapy [ Mauri et al , 2005 ; Mieog et al , 2007 ] , last year show increase use primary systemic treatment , also patient earlier stage breast cancer . The suggested advantage policy 1 ) primary systemic treatment allow monitor response treatment , type chemotherapy change case response , 2 ) primary systemic treatment may shrink tumour volume , allow high percentage breast conserve therapy [ Mieog et al , 2007 ] ; 3 ) overall 40 % chance convert positive axillary node pre-PST negative , question need axillary dissection [ Fontein et al , 2013 ; Kuehn et al , 2013 ] . A major disadvantage primary systemic treatment however , indication post-operative radiotherapy base upon study loco-regional recurrence correlate pathological T N stage patient treat chemotherapy surgery . Since primary systemic treatment affect pathological T N stage , indication post-operative radiotherapy patient become uncertain . Objective : The primary aim study evaluate 5 yr locoregional recurrence rate ( LRR ) cT1-2cN0-1 ( cytology/histology and/or positive SN , exclude patient &gt; 3 pathologic axillary node image ) breast cancer patient , treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy , breast surgery , radiotherapy protocolized base pathology finding chemotherapy definitive surgery ( ypTNM stage ) . The secondary aim develop risk model base risk factor , use predict patient cT1-2cN0-1 breast carcinoma , treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy surgery , 5 yr LRR &gt; 8 % radiotherapy withheld . Study design : This study multicentre prospective cohort study . Study population : In total 710 patient cT1-2pN0-1 , exclude â‰¥cN2 patient &gt; 3 pathologic axillary node imaging , breast cancer , treat least three cycle chemotherapy follow breast axillary surgery eligible study . During 5 year ( 2011-2015 ) patient diagnose primary breast cancer eligible accord criterion register National Cancer Registry project . Currently , three surgical strategy follow cT1-2N0-1 patient , treat primary systemic treatment : 1 . A full axillary lymph node dissection perform primary systemic treatment , OR 2 . A sentinel node procedure carry prior neoadjuvant treatment , axillary surgery perform chemotherapy , patient clinically node negative ( ycN0 ) ) , OR 3 . A sentinel node procedure carry primary systemic treatment , case patient still/has become clinically node negative ( ycN0 ) . For three mentioned strategy , patient divide three risk group , mainly base post chemotherapy pathological nodal status ( strategy 1 3 ) , pre-chemotherapy pathological nodal status ycN0 status ( strategy 2 ) . In addition , three strategy cT ycT status take account choose recommend guideline . The radiation treatment guideline subsequent three risk group consist : 1 . Group I - low risk ( N = 237 ) : 1. MRM : radiotherapy 2. BCT : radiation treatment breast boost ( optional ) 2 . Group II - intermediate risk ( N = 237 ) : 1. MRM : radiation treatment thoracic wall 2. BCT : radiation treatment breast boost ( optional ) 3. full ALND perform : add radiation treatment level 1 2 3 . Group III - high risk group ( N = 237 ) : 1. MRM : radiation treatment thoracic wall supraclavicular node 2. BCT : radiation treatment breast boost ( optional ) , supraclavicular node 3. full ALND perform ( recommend ) : add radiation treatment axilla level 1 2 RT axillary ( ALND ) internal mammary chain node optional group III , base local protocol . In case positive sentinel node internal mammary chain prior chemotherapy , internal mammary chain irradiation strongly recommend Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary endpoint 5 yr locoregional recurrence rate ( LRR ) . Secondary endpoint 10 year LRR , 5 , 10 , 15 yr relapse free survival rate ( event except lose follow-up , invasive contralateral cancer , secondary primary ( non-breast ) invasive cancer ) overall survival rate . In addition , analysis perform investigate whether pre-radiotherapy factor ( e.g . like age &lt; 40 yr , response chemotherapy , tumour size ) identify correlate high LRR . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Currently clear data present literature show indication radiotherapy patient group . Based literature available patient treat chemotherapy surgery choose think might optimal treatment benefit/risk perspective . The study focus adequate registration risk factor , treatment , outcome . Date amendment : 1 July 2013 The main reason write amendment current guideline axillary treatment changing , respect surgery respect radiation treatment . Not sufficient data yet present literature define sound evidence base guideline . However , recent new data strongly suggest guideline adapt . Therefore , adapt guideline within framework protocol , aim carefully follow record outcome patient treat new guideline . Whilst write amendment , also use opportunity well define `` suspicious node '' imaging , add another relevant endpoint : relapse free survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : cT12 invasive breast cancer , without one pathologically proven tumour positive axillary lymph node ( either sentinel node biopsy , ultrasound/palpation guide biopsy fine needle aspiration ) At least 3 cycle primary systemic treatment give ( irrespective regimen ) No standard axillary lymph node dissection perform prior chemotherapy Exclusion criterion : cT3T4 invasive breast cancer prior treatment Patients &gt; 3 suspicious axillary node image cN23 prior treatment More focally irradical surgery breast conserve therapy To investigate whether patient eligible RAPCHEM study , meticulous examination axilla necessary . Therefore patient undergo ultrasound axilla possible ultrasound guide needle biopsy UNB ( FNA core ) . The US/UNB perform instantly second look case enlarge node MRI . The criterion perform UNB : Cortex &gt; 2.3 mm measure pole node ; Disappearance fatty hilum ; Asymmetric bulge cortex lymph node ; If PETCT perform bad outcome two study accept real clinical stage axilla ( i.e . 1 PA proven positive lymph node ultrasound 3 PETCT ; mean 3 positive lymph node ) The N status axilla prior chemotherapy base upon : Positive PETCT one less 4 axillary node ; since specificity PET positive node proven breast cancer patient high , pathology confirmation absolutely require Positive US axillary node ; least one pathology proven tumour positive The bad outcome 1 2 represent reliable clinical axillary staging .</criteria>
