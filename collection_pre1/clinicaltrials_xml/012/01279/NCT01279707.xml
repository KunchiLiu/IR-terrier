	<brief_summary>The treatment adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( ALL ) progress considerably past 3 decade , particularly due intensification chemotherapy , improve supportive care incorporation stem cell transplantation . However , maximum tolerability standard chemotherapeutics reach ALL . Using conventional chemotherapy , 80-85 % adult ALL achieve complete remission ( CR ) . Unfortunately treatment relapse generally unsuccessful rarely result , long-term survival ( 7 % survival 5 year ) . Therefore , investigator explore novel treatment strategy use monoclonal antibody ( MoAbs ) direct surface antigen leukaemic blast . Using MoAbs direct surface protein B cell excellent result B-cell diseases low high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma , without additional toxicity . There also limit evidence small study case report efficacy MoAbs ALL . This Phase I/II study determine safety tolerability combination veltuzumab epratuzumab intensive chemotherapy patient relapse B-cell ALL . A maximum 51 patient treated combination UKALL XII induction chemotherapy monoclonal antibody veltuzumab epratuzumab . Veltuzumab epratuzumab humanise monoclonal antibody target CD20 CD22 surface protein , respectively . Both protein express ALL tumour B cell . One group patient receive modify UKALL XII chemotherapy + veltuzumab ; second , modify UKALL XII chemotherapy + epratuzumab limit toxicity find first 2 group , third group receive , modify UKALL XII chemotherapy + veltuzumab epratuzumab . Patients assess safety , tolerability disease response . Safety tolerability measure number Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) group . Disease response measure microscopic appearance patient bone marrow sample day 29 , molecular test tumour cell bone marrow .</brief_summary>
