	<brief_summary>The aim study ass current practice within PROP &amp; lung team , treat asymptomatic patient centrally locate non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , observe outcome patient receive immediate defer RT . This prospective cohort trial . Patients manage immediate radiotherapy ( RT ) defer approach accord physician ' individual current clinical practice . Baseline follow-up data collection structure focus patient-reported measure describe clinical outcome two management group . Indications prescribe RT dose fractionation schedule also collect . A new intervention introduce trial . Instead , follow-up regimen offer group patient , RT offer deferred group patient if/when symptom develop , monitor symptoms/toxicities QoL group patient .</brief_summary>
