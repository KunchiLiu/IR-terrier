	<brief_summary>The project aim assessment effect FTO gene polymorphism type treatment development overweight/obesity feature metabolic syndrome child type 1 diabetes . Gene polymorphism include genetic variant may predispose development cardiovascular disease complication . The A allele FTO gene predispose obesity occur approximately 40 % European population copy allele increase BMI 0.1 Z-score i.e . 0.4 kg/m2 .

	<detailed_description>Aim : The project aim assessment effect FTO gene polymorphism type treatment development overweight/obesity feature metabolic syndrome child type 1 diabetes . Particular objective project provide answer question : Are type 1 diabetic child carrier AA genotype FTO gene polymorphism ( rs9939609 ) risk weight gain course insulin therapy compare carrier TA TT genotypes polymorphism ? Background : Gene polymorphism include genetic variant may predispose development cardiovascular disease complication . A great advance study genetic susceptibility obesity discovery gene call FTO - fat mass obesity associate gene . The A allele FTO gene predispose obesity occur approximately 40 % European population copy allele increase BMI 0.1 Z-score i.e . 0.4 kg/m2 . However , data impact human genome body weight change follow particular intervention . An important problem dealt physician type 1 diabetic patient overweight obesity . This problem inevitably associate insulin therapy excess energy intake . Insulin therapy diabetic patient may result excess body weight gain . The exact mechanism underlie phenomenon know . Obesity patient diagnose diabetes additional risk factor cardiovascular disease . Central obesity , insulin resistance , dyslipidaemia arterial hypertension element metabolic syndrome - disease predispose development cardiovascular disorder . Cardiovascular complication main cause morbidity mortality adult patient diabetes . However recently repeat attempt make assess factor also child adolescent . Overweight obesity type 1 diabetes depend among others patient ' sex , age type treatment . Although role gene polymorphism development obesity adult child subject extensive investigation , currently report would assess genetic aspect obesity treatment type 1 diabetes . Therefore need study involve large group child assess cardiovascular risk factor type 1 diabetes along genetic association . Patients : The study include 1500 child type 1 diabetes , age 6-18 year . Reference group make 1500 child type 1 diabetes exclude . The following variable assess treatment group : 1 ) Anthropometric data questionnaire data : age , sex , body height weight , body mass index ( BMI ) ( include SDS-BMI ) , waist hip circumference , arm thigh circumference , family history overweight/obesity , type 1 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease , 2 ) Primary disease characteristic : age disease onset , treatment regimen ( intensive insulin therapy versus functional insulin therapy personal insulin pump ) , mean daily insulin consumption per kg body weight , brand insulin product , glycated haemoglobin ( last available measurement mean value last year ) , BMI first 3-6 month follow diabetes onset , diet - consumption carbohydrate protein-fat exchange ( patient use personal insulin pump ) , conversion data actual ideal calorie intake 3 ) Laboratory data : lipid profile ( total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglyceride ) blood pressure ( average three measurement ) . In control group anthropometric variable questionnaire data assess along additional question . Methodology : Gene polymorphism analysis extract DNA make real-time PCR method use TaqMan 7900 HT Applied Biosystems . Correlations FTO gene polymorphism clinical variable BMI ( include BMI increase since disease onset ) , body weight height , waist hip circumference , arm thigh circumference , blood pressure assess professional statistician specially dedicate software ( R-project ) . Moreover parameter diet metabolic control assess . As regard insulin therapy follow variable analyse : insulin injection device , therapy regimen ( intensive versus functional ; brand type insulin product : human insulin versus insulin analogue ) , consumption insulin . Out laboratory data , lipid metabolism parameter assess . All list variable correlate genotype find gene polymorphism analysis . The study approve Bioethics Committee Medical University Białystok . Results : The author project expect effect FTO gene polymorphism overweight/obesity feature metabolic syndrome child type 1 diabetes show . Moreover project enable assessment effect therapeutic regimen , include type insulin product , body weight increase course type 1 diabetes treatment context FTO gene polymorphism . Confirmation association identification group risk excess body weight increase course insulin therapy may help physician , parent patient avoid complication . Therefore clinical benefit project include identification - base genetic assay result - group type 1 diabetic child particularly likely develop overweight , obesity cardiovascular risk factor .</detailed_description>
