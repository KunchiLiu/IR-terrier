	<detailed_description>Background Several widely use image modality available today human lung . Conventional radiology , CT , less extent MRI , well nuclear medicine indication well establish commonly use . Methods use acoustic signal , notably ultrasound , successfully develop . This primarily due fact acoustic damping lung parenchyma prohibitively high high frequency . Assessment alteration structure function thoracic organs occur disease often give rise measurable change lung sound production transmission . Acoustic assessment stethoscope commonly use method assess structural functional change . However , auscultation stethoscope many limitation . It subjective process depend individual 's hearing , experience ability differentiate different sound pattern . In addition , quantitative measurement documentation easy produce . Moreover , stethoscope frequency response attenuate frequency component lung sound signal 120Hz , human ear sensitive low frequency band . Analysis acoustic sound computer likely successful clinical application base mathematical model underlie physical mechanism respiratory sound production . Such model allow interaction mechanical force , airflow sound transmission within respiratory tract understood relate different disease process . The VRI technology , best knowledge , first kind provide radiation free dynamic image lung , use combination well-known technology , i.e . acoustic sensor , proprietary algorithm . Since acoustic response body depend structural property , complex structure exhibit acoustic response , may vary space , time frequency . Moreover , structural alteration , bronchial obstruction space occupy infiltration , reflect corresponding modification acoustic response . The VRI take advantage physical principle , mean image system . By attach two dimensional matrix acoustic transducer back patient , dynamic image integrate acoustic characteristic underlying structure generate . The VRI device may provide complementary diagnostic tool lung examination aid physician determine whether chest x-ray performed . Study Device The VRI system computerized-based , radiation free device intend non-invasive recording , audio reproduction , dynamic image display vibration response airflow respiration . ( The VRI system incorporate flow volume sensor patient may/may breathe ) . The VRI system incorporate pressure sensor ( electronic stethoscope ) specially adapted capture record energy create airflow lung respiration process . Sensors mount two sensor matrix , attach patient 's back low vacuum and/or biocompatible medical sticker method . The signal transmit wire sensor matrix hardware board . The analog signal process online multi-channels hardware board amplifying , sample A/D conversion . The digital data transmit PC platform . Once PC platform , Deep Breeze proprietary algorithm generate dynamic lung image . Risk Analysis Unlike X-Ray base methodology , expose subject ionization radiation , VRI radiation free . The VRI element come contact subject 's skin biocompatible . The VRI approve independent authorized laboratory electrically safe . In addition , far , adverse event , risk illness , injury , discomfort associate use VRI previous study . Therefore , reasonable conclude VRI pose risk subject and/or operator . Study Rationale Various report study suggest reduction 50 % X ray could achieve without detriment care treatment patient . A considerable number X-ray procedure carry today produce meaningful useful diagnostic information elimination examination would bring reduction , state Irish Institute Radiography . One study investigate use chest X-ray ( CXR ) typical urban practice reference Royal College Radiology ( RCR ) guideline . A total 569 CXRs perform 482 patient . Thirty per cent CXRs assess `` indicated '' significant percentage request come within RCR guideline . According Royal College Radiologists ( RCR ) Working Party least 20 % radiological examination carry NHS hospital clinically unhelpful . This translate whole country annual total 7 million unnecessary X-ray examination cost Â£60 million , high number unnecessary X-ray examination chest great financial cost arise examination chest barium investigation . , , Unnecessary radiation exposure medical procedure avoid . This particularly important patient child , since child expose radiation relatively great risk adult . The American College Radiology note , `` Because rapidly divide cell adults longer life expectancy , odds child develop cancer x-ray radiation may significantly high adult . '' It estimate National Research Council 's Committee Biological Effects Ionizing Radiation child less 10 year age several time sensitive radiation middle-aged adult . The VRI device may provide complementary diagnostic tool lung examination aid physician determine whether chest x-ray ( CXR ) necessary thereby reduce number negative CXR . Summary Clinical Experience The device already use investigational purpose number medical center ( Israel , USA , Europe Japan ) . All clinical study perform accordance ICH-GCP guideline well local law regulation relevant use new diagnostic device . Recorded data collect analyzed 3000 adult subject period three year . No related adverse event report study . Study Objective - The principal objective pilot study acquire database pneumonia case child . - The secondary objective correlate clinical CXR data VRI result .</detailed_description>
