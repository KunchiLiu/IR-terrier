	<brief_summary>Neuromuscular Electrical stimulation ( NMES ) swallow recently propose treatment dysphagia post stroke clinically receive favor treatment modality , absence strong research support . This study aim investigate effect NMES therapy dysphagia upon recovery swallow function follow stroke . The study follow pilot randomize controlled trial design . Fifty one patient admit sub-acute rehabilitation facility clinically screen dysphagia , randomize one three group , NMES , sham NMES usual care -behavioral swallow therapy arm . All patient treat one hour per day 3 week , progress outcome monitor . The result add preliminary data effectiveness form swallow treatment patient follow stroke , potential enable efficient allocation resource post-acute rehabilitation thus benefit afford stroke patient , community .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot randomize control trial ( N=51 ) include stroke patient admit sub-acute rehabilitation facility . Subjects clinically screen dysphagia , randomize three group , NMES , sham NMES usual care -behavioral swallow therapy arm . Following randomization , subject undergo video-x-ray ( modified barium swallow ) swallow confirm presence oropharyngeal dysphagia provide objective data nature degree dysphagia . All patient treat one hour per day 3 week , progress outcome record . Participants independently evaluate blinded assessor baseline , post treatment 3 month follow treatment . The primary outcome improvement clinical swallowing ability , oral intake level , body weight . The result add preliminary data effectiveness form swallow treatment patient follow stroke .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stroke identify neurological radiological examination Oropharyngeal dysphagia confirm clinical radiological examination No prior history oropharyngeal dysphagia patient and/or caregiver report No previous head/neck surgery trauma may impact swallow ability No other/concomitant neurological disorder ( e.g . Parkinson 's disease ) would impact oropharyngeal swallow ability . This include poststroke deficit . Physician patient/family agreement participate . Exposed previous behavioral NMES swallow therapy within 6 month admission Presence progressive neurological disorder , ALS ; Parkinson 's neurologic disorder within last 6 month ; History neurosurgery ( either ablative stimulatory ) , encephalitis significant head trauma . History significant medical condition heart , liver , renal disease ; history evidence malignancy within past 5 year excise basal cell carcinoma . Because FDA Warnings , patient cardiac demand pace maker exclude . Patients evidence significant cognitive impairment dementia reflect MiniMental test le 23 and/or score 50 % less comprehension quotient Western Aphasia Battery .</criteria>
