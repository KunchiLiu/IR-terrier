	<brief_summary>This clinical trial test GO-203-2c , newly discover compound bind oncoprotein ( cancer cause protein ) call MUC1 ( over-expressed many cancer ) . By bind MUC1 , GO-203-2c eventually cause tumor cell death laboratory study . This study do : - Test safety GO-203-2c see effect ( good bad ) cancer - Find high dose GO-203-2c give without cause bad side effect - Examine much GO-203-2c blood certain time give quickly body get rid - Observe whether effect GO-203-2c size activity cancer body</brief_summary>
