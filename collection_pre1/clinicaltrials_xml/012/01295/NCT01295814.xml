	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate investigational treatment interstitial cystitis . Interstitial cystitis chronic bladder disease include follow symptom : Urinary frequency day , urinary frequency night , urinary urgency bladder discomfort relieve void . Presently , cure interstitial cystitis . The response current treatment poor . Patients interstitial cystitis poorer quality life . The cause interstitial cystitis unknown . This study evaluate drug Humira® ( adalimumab ) improve symptoms patient interstitial cystitis . Humira® injectable anti-inflammatory medication available use since December 31 , 2002 .

	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Adalimumab Treat Interstitial Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interstitial cystitis ( IC ) chronic disable bladder syndrome characterize urinary frequency , nocturia , urinary urgency , pain bladder filling—relieved empty . There cure IC treatment option suboptimal . Patients IC report significant negative effect physical mental quality life . The etiology IC unknown . Certain aspects IC suggest autoimmunity may play role initiate sustain chronic inflammatory response . Bladder biopsies patient IC demonstrate increase number mast cell . Mast cell activation release tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) may mediate bladder inflammation . Humira® ( adalimumab ) medication block effect TNF . Humira® ( adalimumab ) FDA approve treatment rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , ankylose spondylitis , Crohn 's disease . These disease similar IC . In study , hypothesis test Humira® ( adalimumab ) show efficacy reduce symptom IC .</detailed_description>
