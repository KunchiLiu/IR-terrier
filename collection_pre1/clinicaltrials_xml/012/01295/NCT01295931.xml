	<brief_summary>Objectives : 1 . To determine feasibility use microdose amount near-infrared ( NIR ) fluorescent contrast agent image tumor-draining contralateral lymphatics melanoma patient prior standard-of-care sentinel lymph node biopsy OR completion lymph node dissection ( axillary inguinofemoral ) 2 . To determine feasibility use nonradioactive optical image technique indocyanine green ( ICG ) fluorescent contrast agent characterize lymphatic architecture function correlate observed lymphatic structure function tumor nodal status determine standard-of-care immunohistochemical evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Indocyanine Green Injections : IC-Green Injections : If find eligible take part study , receive total 10-16 injection IC-Green needle arm leg , start hand foot ( 5-8 arm/leg ) , depend location tumor . You may receive additional injection torso , tumor torso area study doctor think need . The study doctor discus number injection receive detail . The injection give surgery injection give intradermally ( layer skin ) . The IC-Green injection allow researcher see fluid flow body image . This information may help future researcher easily locate lymph node patient schedule lymph node surgery . After IC-Green injection give , image procedure begin . To perform imaging procedure , researcher use experimental camera shin special red light onto skin cause IC-Green glow image take . The red light like red light grocery store scanner . The imaging procedure take 1 hour complete perform surgery . Before IC-Green injection image procedure , member research staff monitor record vital sign ( blood pressure , breathe rate , heart rate , temperature ) . Vital sign measurement take every 15 minute 1 hour IC-Green injection , every 30 minute second hour . A study staff member also closely monitor injection site time possible side effect . A study staff member call next day ask take temperature . This phone call last 10 minute . Length Study : After image take , follow-up evaluation complete , participation study . Follow-Up Evaluation : If spend night hospital surgery , study staff member visit person day surgery . At visit , temperature record , ask feeling , experienced side effect . The visit last 10 minute . If spend night hospital surgery , contact phone day surgery ask current temperature , feeling , experienced side effect . The phone call last 10 minute . This investigational study . IC-Green FDA approve commercially available assessment cardiac output , hepatic function , liver blood flow , ophthalmic angiography , map heart , liver , eye function . The use IC-Green mapping lymph node melanoma patient investigational . IC-Green FDA approve injected vein . Giving IC-Green injection layer skin device use give injection investigational . The experimental camera , image take , use research purpose use manage treatment . Up 18 patient take part Part 1 study . All enrol MD Anderson . Complete Lymph Node Dissection : If agree participate part study , additional imaging perform surgery follow-up visit . The imaging perform MD Anderson surgery regularly schedule standard care follow-up visit 4-6 month surgery learn lymphatic channel look like completely heal surgery . Before image session , receive total 10-16 injection IC-Green needle arm hand legs foot , ( 5-8 arm/leg ) , depend location tumor . Researchers use experimental camera perform imaging procedure . You may receive additional injection torso , tumor torso area study doctor think need . The imaging procedure take 2 hour complete time . For participant , IC-Green injection image procedure , member research staff monitor record vital sign ( blood pressure , breathe rate , heart rate , temperature ) . Vital sign measurement take every 15 minute 1 hour IC-Green injection , every 30 minute second hour . A study staff member also closely monitor injection site time possible side effect . Length Study : Your participation image take long-term follow-up complete . This investigational study . IC-Green FDA approve commercially available assessment cardiac output , hepatic function , liver blood flow , ophthalmic angiography , map heart , liver , eye function . The use IC-Green mapping lymph node melanoma patient investigational . IC-Green FDA approve injected vein . Giving IC-Green injection layer skin device use give injection investigational . The experimental camera , image take , use research purpose use manage treatment . Up 6 patient participate part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
