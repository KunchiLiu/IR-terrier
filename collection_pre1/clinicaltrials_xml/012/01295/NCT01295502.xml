	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose paclitaxel carboplatin cisplatin radiation therapy treat patient stage IB-IVA cervical cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , paclitaxel , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving paclitaxel carboplatin cisplatin radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) adjuvant carboplatin paclitaxel chemotherapy follow concurrent weekly cisplatin chemotherapy extend field radiation woman newly diagnose stage IB-IVA cervical cancer , positive para-aortic node . II . To determine feasibility treatment regimen four cycle adjuvant chemotherapy MTD estimate . III . To assess toxicity treatment regimen National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate treatment regimen patient measurable disease . II . To examine progression-free survival one year treatment regimen . III . To examine overall survival . IV . To examine location recurrence , loco-regional versus distant one year completion therapy . V. To estimate frequency chronic toxicity experience within one year study entry . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study carboplatin paclitaxel . Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 undergo extended-field radiotherapy daily 5 day week 6 week follow brachytherapy . Beginning 4-6 week completion chemoradiation , patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy comprise paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
