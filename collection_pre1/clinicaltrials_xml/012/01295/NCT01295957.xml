	<brief_summary>The effectiveness reminiscence dementia claim effective tool , scientific validation systematic assessment method need . Materials Methods : A randomized control trial ( RCT ) conduct search whether reminiscence program associate improvement quality life demented long term care resident . The trial three arm : interventional , comparison control . The reminiscence program model within life-story approach , comparison group receive informal counsel control change quality life result social contact . The Social Engagement Scale ( SES ) Self-rated Quality Life Index ( SRQoL ) outcome measure . The result examine baseline ( T0 ) , twelve week ( T1 ) , 6 month ( T2 ) intervention . The sample 135 subject [ intervention group ( N=45 ) , comparison group ( N=45 ) control group ( N=45 ) ] .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total number 135 resident recruit two private fund long term nursing home , share equal structural functional characteristic . Subjects randomly assign one three group ( intervention , comparison control ) . The subject admit study diagnose Alzheimer 's disease accord DSM-IV able communicate Holden Communication Scale score &gt; 25 Folstein mental Exam score 10 . Exclusion criterion active major psychiatric disorder ( schizophrenia , major affective disorder ) ; acute unstable chronic medical condition include cardiac lung disease ; blindness deafness , even hear aid , assess RAI blindness deafness scale . Power sample size calculation . Sample size estimate take account study test null hypothesis whether different participate group similar different . It assume significant change dementia nursing home resident quality life ( QoL ) baseline would half standard deviation , equal 3 point , find previous longitudinal study10 . With predicted effect size QoL , power 80 % type I error independent group 0.01 , estimate sample size 143 participant total study population . Methods material The intervention design individual treatment condition participate subject receive 24 bi-weekly session reminiscence therapy , last one hour one , period 12 week . The latter refers use image , sentence memorabilia help focus specific segment life history individual , stimulate emergence affect-laden personal recall , later verbalize context guide conversation . The term story life intend highlight sample meaningful event subject 's life rather historically structure biography . The control group administer counsel informal social contact bi-weekly session one hour , n't participate reminiscence session . This intended rule possibility improvement quality life due attention receive social stimulation . The comparison group receive unstructured social contact , bi-weekly session one hour one . Remaining feature design three arm similar exception structure reminiscence program participation . The study approve local Ethics Review Committee . This study adopt single-blinded , parallel-group ( one intervention , one comparison , one control [ no-intervention ] group ) design address follow hypothesis : ) resident Alzheimer 's disease submit reminiscence program intervention show well quality life consequence great sense self identity regard group specific therapeutic intervention , b ) quality life improvement sustain beyond actual therapeutic intervention , due consolidation self identity reinforce effect increase competence , efficacy personal involvement everyday activity , associate high sense self . Demographic clinical data resident , include age , gender , marital status , level education , religion , length dementia , length stay nursing home , associate medical problem , Mini-mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score , Cognitive Performance Scale level ( CPS ) 15 , ability communicate , functional ability , use psychotropic medication , fitness program , physical restriction , number visit per month family friends , caregiver burden Burden Interview ( short version ) collect . The severity dementia stag CDR . The functional performance resident assess use index physical function level independence eating , dress , toileting , transfer , walk use magnitude estimation weight . Each level disability activity give weight , rather simple count . The result score range 0 ( limitation ) 3.77 ( completely disable five activity daily live ) ratio scale property . To assess physical restraint investigator use indicator daily use full bed rail , trunk limb restraint , chair prevents rise . Physical restraint aspect individual resident , clinical care process modifiable facility . Restraint use consider indicator poor quality care infringement individual autonomy diminishes QOL . Cognitive performance assess CPS . This clinically derive scale predict MMSE Test Severe Impairment scores18 . While MMSE floor effect minimal score suggest questionable validity cognitively impaired elder , TSI achieve meaningful variation , minimize reliance language skill permit subject answer correctly nonverbal well verbal response . Is compose twenty-one item cover six cognitive area : well-learned motor performance , language comprehension , language production , immediate delayed memory , conceptualization , general knowledge . The best score 24 , low zero . For person MMSE score 11 , TSI score 22 high . The CPS compose five item : 1-short-term memory , 2-cognitive skill daily decision making , 3-coma ( persistent vegetative state ) , 4-making self understood 5-eating . The scale average inter-rater reliability 0.85 sensibility 0.92 specificity 0.87 . The CPS classify resident seven cognitive performance level , level 0 ( Intact ) mean MMSE score 25 , Level 6 ( Very Severe Impairment ) near zero . CPS Levels 2 3 ( Mild Moderate Impairment ) correspond MMSE score 10 high , average 10.3 13.8 , TPI 21 ( SD=3.6 ) . The Social Engagement Scale19 rate resident status last seven day area ease interaction others plan structured activity . Each item rank binary basis , yes ( 1 ) ( 0 ) caregiver . The high score 6 low 0 . It high internal consistency ( intra-class correlation : 0.51-0.64 ) , item show reliability across different group resident variable level functional cognitive status . The resident self-reported SRQoL measure use multidimensional self-report instrument20 . It measure 11 dimension QOL relative resident 's experience : comfort , functional competence , privacy , dignity , autonomy , meaningful activity , relationship , food enjoyment , spiritual well-being , security , individuality . Each dimension score 4-point Likert scale , 4 meaning often , 3 sometimes , 2 rarely 1 never . Residents unable use 4-point scale could answer `` generally yes '' `` generally . '' These response score 3.8 1.5 , respectively , base z score approximation method . Reliability score range Cronbach 's alpha value 0.78 0.8521 . Anxiety assess use Rating Anxiety Dementia ( RAID ) : 18-item scale score &gt; 11 indicate significant anxiety symptom . Depression rule use Minimum Data Set Depression Rating Scale . This standardized screening instrument detect depression among nursing home resident . Its comprises seven core Minimum Data Set mood item sensibility 69 % sensitivity 91 % , Cronbach α measure internal consistency 0,75 . It score range 0-14 cut-off point 3 . The Burden Interview short version ( ZBI ) 24 used measure strain burden experience caregiver 12 item scale , one score 5 point Likert scale 0 ( never ) 4 ( always ) . It range result 0 48 , Cronbach 's alpha 0.88 , cutoff score 17 . Well resident assess use Well-being/Ill-being Scale ( WIB ) 25 include positive component `` able express wish acceptable way , '' `` bodily relaxation , '' `` creative self expression '' ( sing , dance painting ) , negative one `` unattended sadness grief , '' `` sustain anger '' `` anxiety . '' The WIB scale rate category behavior observe every five minute minimum six hour . After five minute , rater quantifies nature observe behavior category assign WIB value . The six-point WIB scale range negative positive ( −5 , −3 , −1 , +1 , +3 , +5 ) . Values calculate end observation period extract mean score .</detailed_description>
