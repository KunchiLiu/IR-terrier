	<brief_title>Comparative Study Biologic Mesh Versus Repair With Component Separation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve comparison open abdominal incisional hernia repair XenMATRIX biologic graft versus repair native tissue . The current study seek evaluate XenMATRIXTM , FDA approve biologic graft repair contaminate abdominal wall defect . This study provide significant insight reconstructive surgeon patient determine whether biologic graft necessary reconstruction contaminate ventral hernia repair provide durable single stag repair .</detailed_description>
