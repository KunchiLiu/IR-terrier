	<brief_summary>This study do 6 part . In Part A dose intravenous ( IV ) pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) escalate find maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) participant histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis type carcinoma melanoma ( MEL ) . Part B study explore safety , tolerability , efficacy drug participant advance metastatic MEL compare every 2 week every 3 week dosing . Part C study explore safety , tolerability , efficacy drug participant non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) locally advanced metastatic . Part D study explore low high dos study drug identify Parts A B participant advance metastatic MEL . Part E ( close Amendment 7 ) explore low , medium , high dos study drug combination standard chemotherapy participant locally advance metastatic NSCLC . Part F explore low high dos study drug treatment-naive previously-treated participant NSCLC program cell death 1 ligand ( PD-L1 ) gene expression . In Parts D F Part B participant randomize one dose level . The primary hypothesis follow : pembrolizumab acceptable safety tolerability ; pembrolizumab show clinically meaningful response rate ( RR ) disease-control rate ( DCR ) participant melanoma ( ipilimumab-refractory ) , clinically meaningful RR participant NSCLC , especially clinically meaningful RR participant either cancer , whose tumor express PD-L1 .</brief_summary>
