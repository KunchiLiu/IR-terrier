	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) peripheral artery become essential diagnosis follow-up peripheral arterial disease . In clinical routine , acquisition use intravenous injection Gadolinium base contrast agent ( gadolinium chelate ) . Initially , contrast enhance MR angiography ( CE-MRA ) recommend diabetic patient , elderly patient and\or patient chronic renal insufficiency present contraindication CT angiography use iodize contrast agent injection . However , increase nephrogenic systematic fibrosis clinical case , would secondary gadolinium chelate injection , patient chronic renal insufficiency restrict use CE-MRA . More 500 case describe date world . Its occurrence currently estimate around 4 % patient terminal chronic renal insufficiency mortality around 30 % . According recommendation AFSSAPS August , 2007 , two gadolinium contrast agent ( Gadodiamide-OMNISCAN * , General Electric HealthCare Gadopentetate Dimeglumine-MAGNEVIST * , Bayer HealthCare ) contraindicate glomerular filtration rate lower 30 ml/mn . Non-contrast enhance MR angiography ( NCE MRA ) technique propose provide complete non-invasive investigation peripheral vasculature , abdominal aorta calf , thus offer patient chronic renal insufficiency surrogate side effect . Moreover , use high field ( 3T ) MR image phase array coil offer high quality image good signal noise ratio peripheral vasculature analysis . Besides , acquisition repeat required require contrast injection . The main objective evaluate quality NCE image obtain every investigated station abdominal aorta calf . The secondary objective compare diagnostic performance NCE image CE MRA . The third objective estimate contribution automate dedicated post-processing tool optimize diagnostic quality image .</brief_summary>
