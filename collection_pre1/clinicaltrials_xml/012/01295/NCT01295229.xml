	<brief_summary>The escalate pandemic obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) among significant contributor morbidity mortality worldwide . Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) surgery cause profound weight loss dramatically ameliorate T2DM mechanism beyond weight loss , role diabetes management nature weight-independent anti-diabetes effect well establish paucity appropriate randomize trial , execution hinder numerous obstacle . The investigator therefore propose feasibility study demonstrate capacity identify , recruit , randomize , track outcomes 40 adult Group Health member identify T2DM BMI 30-40 kg/m2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calorie Reduction Or Surgery : Seeking Remission Obesity And Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal research study demonstrate capacity identify , recruit , randomize , track outcomes 40 adult Group Health member identify T2DM BMI 30-40 kg/m2 . Our cohort recruitment strategy utilize GH administrative clinical database identify patient T2DM BMI 30-40 kg/m2 . Sufficient number ( N=4,000 ) individual mail survey identify small minority without strong preference regard medical vs. surgical diabetes/obesity treatment . This subset invite become well informed strategy use novel , standardized patient decision aid share decision making ( SDM ) relate bariatric surgery : high-quality educational video provide balance frequently update information risk benefit surgical non-surgical care . After view SDM tool , potential subject ' `` willingness randomize '' assess , subset willing patient actually undergo randomization either RYGB state-of-the-art intensive reproducible medical/lifestyle intervention . Forty patient randomize either RYGB intensive medical/lifestyle intervention . Twenty member randomly assign intensive behavioral/medical treatment , twenty randomly assign receive gastric bypass surgery . In non-surgical group , investigator study feasibility resource need deploy state-of-the-art intensive behavioral intervention promote weight loss , include dietary exercise component . It couple diabetes pharmacotherapy treatment consistent Group Health Clinical Practice Guidelines ( http : //incontext.ghc.org/clinical/clin_topics/diabetes2/dm2_poc.html ) . Patients randomized surgical arm undergo standard laparoscopic proximal RYGB , commonly practice GH surgeon . The operation post-operative care perform GH Dr. Steven Bock , Dr. Jeffery Lander , clinical staff , include team nutritionist Registered Nurse Case Manager coordinate care patient GH Bariatric Surgery Program . Surgical patient also undergo standardized 8-week pre-operative 10-month post-operative behavioral treatment regimen GH Bariatric Surgery Program . Participants follow-up research visit 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month randomization , follow measurement : standardize physically exam Dr. Foster-Schubert ; weight , waist hip circumference ; systolic diastolic blood pressure ; rest 1-minute pulse ; fast ( 12-hour ) blood ( 50 ml ) collection .</detailed_description>
