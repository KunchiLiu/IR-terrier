	<brief_summary>Rationale New chemotherapeutic agent need relapse B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( B-CLL ) overcome resistance CLL cell . Valproic acid ( VPA ) inhibitor histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) use anticonvulsant mood-stabilizing drug decade . VPA mediate apoptosis CLL cell caspase activation . VPA show toxicity toward CLL cell display alteration p53 pathway . The combination VPA fludarabine 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine ( CdA , Cladribine ) result synergistic loss B-CLL cell viability , significant increase apoptosis . The high index synergism observe VPA CdA , purine nucleoside analog active B-CLL . Study design Overall , study propose previously treat patient advance B-CLL , eligible aggressive approach , exhibit progressive disease . A total 33 patient include . Estimated enrolment time 2 year . - First part : It plan start therapy single VPA 2 month , target plasma level report active vitro toward CLL cell ( exceed therapeutic level seizure prevention ) , parallel , verify whether cellular target VPA actually inhibit leukemic B-lymphocytes . - Second part : After VPA preloading period ( 2 month ) , patient evaluate receive CdA . CdA give 5.6 mg/m²/day intravenously 3 day , reduced-dose schedule less toxic - obvious cost loss efficacy - compare standard dosage 5 day . CdA chosen display high level vitro synergism VPA . Four monthly course CdA give . Patients evaluate . VPA stop time response evaluation ( schedule 28 day last course CdA ) .</brief_summary>
