	<brief_summary>Vitamin D play critical role maintain bone health , well prevent cardiovascular disease , cancer , various autoimmune disease , diabetes . Vitamin D deficiency common United States worldwide , increasingly recognize treat . One group vitamin D deficiency may particularly important patient kidney stone . These patient frequently elevate level calcium urine , common important risk factor calcium contain kidney stone . Because vitamin D increase absorption calcium blood intestine , physician may reluctant prescribe vitamin D therapy patient vitamin D deficiency also kidney stone high amount calcium urine . They concern possible risk increase amount calcium urine ( thereby increase risk calcium stone occur ) . However , study patient without kidney stone , well study patient high calcium level urine , demonstrate give vitamin D effective safe increase calcium urine . Therefore , investigator study effect give vitamin D amount calcium urine patient history kidney stone elevate calcium urine . The investigator evaluate safety give vitamin D particular group patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator plan conduct clinic-based interventional study 30 patient follow outpatient urology clinic associate New York Presbyterian Hospital ( NYPH ) . The intervention supplementation oral ergocalciferol 50,000 IU per week 8 week , participant serve his/her control . The formulation , dose , duration vitamin D therapy reflective give routine clinical practice patient vitamin D deficiency . The outcome change urinary calcium excretion .</detailed_description>
