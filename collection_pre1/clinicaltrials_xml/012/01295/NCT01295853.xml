	<brief_title>T3 Versus T4 Sympathicotomy Treatment Primary Palmar Hyperhidrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Palmar hyperhidrosis ( PH ) benign sympathetic disorder threaten health affect daily activity , may cause social withdrawal even depression.1 An incidence 1 % report various series literature . The incidence men woman ; however woman likely seek medical attention , may explain high incidence female patient surgical series [ 2,3 ] . Although various treatment option available , include topical systemic therapy , iontophoresis , regional nerve block , botulinum toxin injection , limitation 4 . Video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathetic surgery currently worldwide accept treatment primary palmar hyperhidrosis ( PH ) 5 . However , compensatory hyperhidrosis ( CH ) common serious side effect occur 30-70 % patient T2 T2-3 sympathectomy 6 . For T2 sympathetic surgery seldom use PH . Procedures involve T3 or/and T4 sympathetic ganglion widely accept many center favourable results.5 But patient still present certain degree CH dry hand operation 7 , 8 . The aim study compare two method treatment PH , sympathetic chain transect merely one segment , level either third fourth ribbed , define T3 sympathicotomy T4 sympathicotomy , respectively . Emphasis place evaluation efficacy , side effect , patient ' satisfaction rate two type surgical therapy .</detailed_description>
