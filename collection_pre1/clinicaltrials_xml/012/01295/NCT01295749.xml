	<brief_summary>International recommendation stress importance flow time reduction cardiac arrest management . In fact , flow time independent factor morbidity mortality . In France , cardiac arrest treat first responder ( include emergency nurse ) arrival mobile intensive care unit . Those first responder use bag-valve-mask ventilation therefore practice conventional CPR ( 30 chest compression / 2 ventilation rhythm ) . Laryngeal tube safe efficient device cardiac arrest ventilation . The purpose study compare flow time two strategy hospital cardiac arrest management first responder : conventional CPR bag-valve-mask ventilation vs. compression CPR Laryngeal Tube ventilation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multicentric , prospective , control , randomize study parallel group single blind . Patients include chronological period avoid selection biais ( one month first medical device next month one ) . The determination period centralize . The emergency vehicle supply sufficiently device . This design choose order answer emergency problem . Patients include ventilated paramedical staff ( first responder ) medical staff ( Mobile Intensive Care Unit ) intervention . Complete detailed information give patient family consent ask . The comparison flow time two strategy hospital cardiac arrest following : A : ventilation bag valve mask interrupt chest compression B : ventilation laryngeal tube continuous chest compression</detailed_description>
