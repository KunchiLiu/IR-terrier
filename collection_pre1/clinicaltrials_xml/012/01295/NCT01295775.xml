	<brief_summary>The aim phase 2 control placebo study ass effectiveness Sulodexide treatment non proliferative ( background ) retinopathy patient Type 1 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus . This multicentre , double-blind , randomise study involve patient affect non proliferative ( background ) diabetic mild moderate retinopathy . This study involve 130 patient ( 65 group ) . At baseline visit ( T0 ) , Investigator grade ocular lesion due diabetic retinopathy accord color fundus photograph fluorescein angiography examination . He subsequently send negative photograph image -or negative available- fluorescein angiography off-site Assessor -unaware Investigator assessment- nominate confirm quality image grade lesion . After positive assessment Investigator , T0 eligible patient blindly allocate one 2 treatment group accord computer-generated randomisation list provide Sponsor . The following treatment administer 360 day : A ( SULODEXIDE GROUP ) : 50 mg day oral route ; B ( PLACEBO GROUP ) : Sulodexide placebo schedule lengths time group A . Before break randomisation code end study , independent site assessor evaluate photograph accord Airlie House Classification follow modification Early treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) fluorescein angiography accord ETDRS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy lead cause blindness adult ( 20 74 year old ) industrialised country , affect 2 5 % entire population . All complication diabetes diabetic retinopathy , cause chronic hyperglycaemia . Although good metabolic control therapy lower blood glucose level enough preserve life , permit complete euglycemia prevent long-term complication chronic supernormal level blood glucose . The excess glucose cause flux polyol pathway , result structural tissue modification . Diabetic retinopathy mainly vascular disease , primarily affect capillary . The first ultrastructural microscopic change report retinal capillary basement membrane thicken pericyte degeneration , compromise integrity capillary wall , follow pericyte loss . The glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) basal membrane progressively substitute collagen , lead modification vascular permeability due alter anionic charge . These change lead clinical appearance vascular leakage retinal capillary follow microaneurysms . The lack integrity vessel wall lead haemorrhage , microthrombosis , responsible first ischemic lesion . If vascular leakage last long time , lipidic fraction leak plasma deposit retina form hard exudate . The substitution GAGs collagen lead basal membrane thicken also kidney . As retina , modification permeability occur renal glomerulus induces selective loss protein ( albuminuria ) . Recent paper show specific modification GAGs metabolism occur diabetic patient could common pathogenetic mechanism vascular diabetic failure . Therefore , diabetic retinopathy diabetic nephropathy may regard result alteration common underlie molecular mechanism whose expression depletion GAGs basement membrane retinal glomerular capillary . In agreement previous statement , Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study Diabetic Retinopathy conclude microalbuminuria associate cross-sectionally presence retinopathy diabetic patient . The progress clinical symptom disease despite glycaemic therapy point address research towards new drug able slow reverse vessel micro-abnormalities responsible microangiopathy typical diabetic retinopathy . Furthermore , similarities vessel lesion diabetic retinopathy diabetic nephropathy suggest new molecule effective one two condition effective pathology well . Sulodexide ( fast move heparin fraction 80 % dermatan sulfate 20 % ) GAG high trophism vessel wall . Clinical study show efficacy decrease microalbuminuria macroalbuminuria diabetic patient , suggest could able slowdown nephropathy progression , actually partially restore glomerular GAGs content . Preliminary observation regard use Sulodexide patient suffer diabetic retinopathy show significant reduction hard exudate , thus indirectly point benefit GAG retinal capillary level . Based mentioned physiopathological consideration experimental finding , investigator deem appropriate evaluate effect Sulodexide diabetic retinopathy present multicentre , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial .</detailed_description>
