	<brief_summary>Usually treatment single brain metastasis surgery Stereotactic Radiosurgery ( SRS ) . Surgery involve resection brain tumor mean operation , whereas SRS treatment consist highly focus radiation dose tumor . These two treatment modality widely use , well establish , proven improve survival , far , study do directly compare efficacy one . Neither treatment consider experimental show provide benefit patient metastatic brain tumor . The aim study determine two modality well local control improve quality life . Patients consent study randomize either receive surgery Radiosurgery treatment single brain metastasis . The study seek recruit 12 patient group . Patients study five year time treatment finish . This include follow-up visit 4 week procedure every 3 month procedure 5 year .</brief_summary>
