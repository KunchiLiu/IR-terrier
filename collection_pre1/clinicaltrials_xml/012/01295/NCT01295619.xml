	<brief_title>Performance Safety I-020805 Prevention Cerebrospinal Fluid ( CSF ) Leakage Following Elective Craniotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients consent participate trial fulfil preoperative inclusion exclusion criterion underwent screen prior surgical treatment . After dural suturing , patient meet intra operative inclusion exclusion criterion , receive I-020805 . If necessary , autologous graft use augment dural closure . I-020805 delivered double syringe applicator create fine layer dura . This layer quickly set within second form watertight seal .</detailed_description>
