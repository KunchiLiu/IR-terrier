	<brief_summary>The principal aim study fill clear knowledge gap provide guidance rheumatologist reassurance patient group management challenge face daily rheumatology practice . Specifically , aim provide robust evidence optimal management patient establish RA fail anti-TNF therapy ( first biological therapy introduce ) ; particular , investigator wish address whether currently license non NICE-approved treatment option , TNF-blocking drug abatacept , equivalent NICE-approved treatment , rituximab . If , intention broaden treatment option target specific therapy disease sub-groups .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Male female subject age ≥18 year time signing Informed Consent Form . 2 . Patients diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis per ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criterion ( Appendix 7 ) confirm least 24 week prior screen visit . 3 . Patients fail conventional DMARD therapy per NICE/BSR Guidelines ( 49 ) i.e . failure least 2 DMARDS include MTX . 4 . Patients persistent RA disease activity despite treat current initial TNFi agent least 12 week . Active RA define as* : 1 . Primary nonresponse : failing improve DAS28 &gt; 1.2 ( Appendix 6 ) fail achieve DAS28 ≤ 3.2 within first 12 24 week start initial TNFi . • This may include patient show reduction DAS28 &gt; 1.2 still demonstrate unacceptably high disease activity physician 's judgement evidence overall DAS28 ≥ 3.2 OR 2 . Secondary nonresponse : define inefficacy first TNFi ( demonstrate prior satisfactory response ) per clinician judgement ; intolerance reason cessation first TNFi . 5 . MTX dose stable 4 week prior screen visit continue duration study . 6 . Patients NSAIDs / corticosteroid ( oral prednisolone exceed 10mg daily ) unchanged regimen least 4 week prior screen visit expect remain stable dose baseline assessment complete . 7 . Provided write informed consent prior trialspecific procedure . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Major surgery ( include joint surgery ) within 8 week prior screen visit plan major surgery within 52 week follow randomization . 2 . Patients inflammatory joint disease different origin , mixed connective tissue disease , Reiter 's syndrome , psoriatic arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , arthritis onset prior 16 year age . 3 . Patients receive dos prednisolone &gt; 10mg/day within 4 week prior screen visit . 4 . Patients receive intraarticular intramuscular steroid injection within 4 week prior screen visit . 5 . Patients previously receive 1 TNFi drug OR biological therapy treatment RA . 6 . Patients unable unwilling stop treatment prohibit DMARD ( i.e synthetic DMARD aside MTX e.g . oral injectable gold , chloroquine , hydroxychloroquine , cyclosporine , azathioprine , leflunomide , sulphasalazine ) prior start protocol treatment . 7 . Treatment investigational drug last 12 week prior start protocol treatment . 8 . Patients comorbidity include acute , severe infection , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable ischaemic heart disease , moderate/severe heart failure ( Class III/IV New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system ( 79 ) ) , active bowel disease , active peptic ulcer disease , recent stroke ( within 12 week screen visit ) , condition , opinion investigator , would put patient risk participate study would make implementation protocol difficult . 9 . Patients major episode infection require hospitalisation treatment IV antibiotic within 12 week start treatment protocol oral antibiotic within 4 week start protocol treatment . 10 . Patients significant risk infection , opinion investigator would put patient risk participate study ( e.g . leg ulceration , indwell urinary catheter , septic joint within 52 week ( ever prosthetic joint still situ ) ) . 11 . Patients know active current history recurrent bacterial , viral , fungal , mycobacterial infection include herpes zoster ( tuberculosis Hepatitis B C see ) , exclude fungal infection nail bed per clinical judgment . 12 . Patients untreated active current latent tuberculosis ( TB ) . Patients screen latent TB ( per BSR guideline ) within 24 week prior screen visit , positive , treat follow local practice guideline prior start protocol treatment . 13 . Patients active current hepatitis B and/or C infection . Patients screen hepatitis B C within 24 week prior screen visit positive , exclude study . 14 . Primary secondary immunodeficiency ( history currently active ) unless relate primary disease investigation . 15 . Pregnancy , lactation woman childbearing potential ( WCBP ) unwilling use effective birth control measure ( Appendix 2 ) whilst receive treatment last dose protocol treatment indicate relevant SmPC/IB . 16 . Men whose partner childbearing potential unwilling use effective birth control measure ( Appendix 2 ) whilst receive treatment last dose protocol treatment indicate relevant SmPC/IB . 17 . Patients know significantly impaired bone marrow function example significant anaemia , leukopaenia , neutropaenia thrombocytopaenia show follow laboratory value time screen visit : Haemoglobin &lt; 8.5 g/dl Platelet count &lt; 100 x 109 / L White blood cell count &lt; 2.0 x 109 / L Neutrophil count &lt; 1 x 109 / L 18 . Patients know severe hypoproteinaemia time screen visit , e.g . nephrotic syndrome impair renal function , show : Serum Creatinine &gt; 150 umol / L</criteria>
