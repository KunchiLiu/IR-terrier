	<brief_summary>Background : - Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) able improve lifespan individual infect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) , ART require continuous treatment substantial consequence quality life . ART suppress HIV-1 virus level limit detection current test , completely eradicate virus blood . Recent research attempt determine whether persistent infection stem low-level infection new cell continually infect HIV , cell live long time infection . ART active virus new cell , effect long-lived cell already infect HIV-1 start ART . As result , new strategy may necessary reduce eradicate 'reservoir ' cell . - Interferon natural substance make body combat virus infection , also make injectable drug know PEGINTRON . PEGINTRON injection approve treat hepatitis C infection , include patient HIV infection . Earlier study HIV-infected individual ART show interferon reduce level HIV blood . Researchers interested determine whether PEGINTRON therapy also reduce residual low level HIV patient already take ART . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness PEGINTRON injection HIV level participant currently undergo antiretroviral therapy . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose HIV , currently undergo antiretroviral therapy , maintain HIV virus blood count detectable current commercial test least 12 month start study . Design : - This study involve separate screening treatment process . - Participants screen physical examination medical history , include blood urine sample . The screening analysis determine study eligibility take several week . Participants apheresis provide sufficient number blood cell evaluation study researcher . - Eligible participant begin 4-week course PEGINTRON injection use standard dose PEGINTRON approve treatment chronic hepatitis C. Participants weekly injection frequent blood test measure HIV virus level . - Participants experience problem maintain safe number white blood cell study may receive injection filgrastim increase white blood cell count . - After 4 week treatment , participant return additional blood test study day 28 , 35 , 42 , 49 , 56 , 84 , Weeks 16 , 24 , 36 , 48 ( i.e. , end 1 year start study ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As result combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , morbidity mortality acquire immunodeficiency syndrome decline significantly past 15 year , least developed country . Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infect individual live long , must undergo continuous therapy substantial consequence quality life . ART suppress HIV-1 viremia limit detection current commercial assay ( c. 50 copies/mL plasma ) . , HIV viremia persist even prolonged suppressive therapy . The origin residual viremia yet clear , data suggest production long live HIV infect cell may contribute viremia . Antiretrovirals extremely active replicating cell , thus successfully stop viral replication , effect long-lived viral reservoir cell already infect HIV-1 time antiretroviral therapy initiate . As result , new strategy necessary reduce eradicate long-lived reservoir . Interferon alpha natural cytokine antiviral activity . Prior introduction antiretroviral therapy , several study demonstrate modest effect interferon alpha HIV-1 viremia active cycle infection infect individual . Interferon alpha also effective vitro decrease virus production cell chronically infect HIV-1 . With introduction potent antiretroviral therapy , interferon develop direct anti-HIV drug . Interferon alpha relatively effective therapy hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , use HIV-1/HCV coinfected individual . Kottilil coworkers Laboratory Immunoregulation NIAID show decrease HIV-1 RNA level HCV coinfected participant treat pegylated interferon alpha ribavirin . In stored sample study , conduct retrospective trial sample participant HIV-1 RNA level &lt; 50 copies/mL , show reduction residual viremia use ultrasensitive Single Copy Assay ( SCA ) develop laboratory . As effect interferon HIV viremia cell associate HIV RNA grow interest . In protocol conduct prospective , non-randomized , single arm , pilot study investigate effect pegylated interferon alpha 2b HIV-1 RNA level additional drug participant undergo suppressive antiretroviral therapy viral RNA level suppress less 50 copies/mL plasma . As patient may level HIV RNA low limit detection , also investigate level HIV nucleic acid specie cell well . We determine whether interferon alpha therapy reduce residual viremia cell associate HIV RNA participant suppressive ART , expand understand persistent low-level viremia pathogenesis HIV infected individual .</detailed_description>
