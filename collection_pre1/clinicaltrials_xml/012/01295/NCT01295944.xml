	<brief_title>Carboplatin Bevacizumab Recurrent Ependymoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Ependymomas glial base tumor arise ependymal line ventricular system central canal spinal cord These tumor affect adult child represent approximately 1.2 % -7.8 % intracranial cancer . Currently , standard therapy newly diagnose low-grade ependymoma include total surgical excision , possible , follow radiation therapy . Complete surgical resection often possible location tumor concern damage surround eloquent brain surgery . The situation even critical patient anaplastic ependymomas high proliferative rate great propensity tumor infiltration surround normal brain , prevent possibility complete tumor removal surgery . For patient aggressive anaplastic ependymoma , chemotherapy often administer either radiation hope infiltrate tumor cell eliminate . Extensive experience gather use bevacizumab neuroepithelial tumor malignant glioma . Based interesting result observe report small series patient recurrent ependymomas treat bevacizumab , well evidence VEGF-promoted angiogenesis tumor , design phase II study test efficacy bevacizumab patient recurrent ependymoma . As result type tumor indicate anti-angiogenesis therapy effective give combination cytotoxic chemotherapy , study bevacizumab combine carboplatin . The choice carboplatin justified fact , detail , remain effective agent disease , extensive toxicity data available combination bevacizumab carboplatin variety tumor type , include GBMs . Objective : To evaluate efficacy carboplatin bevacizumab treatment recurrent low grade anaplastic ependymoma . The primary endpoint progression-free survival ( PFS ) one year . Eligibility : - Histologically proven intra-cranial spinal ependymoma anaplastic ependymoma . There must pathologic image confirmation tumor progression regrowth . - Patients must great equal to18 year old . - Patients must Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 . - Patients must adequate bone marrow function , adequate liver function adequate renal function start therapy . - Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy . - Patients undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible . - Patients must fail prior radiation therapy must interval great equal 42 day completion radiation therapy study entry . - Women childbearing potential must negative B-HCG pregnancy test document within 14 day prior registration . - Women childbearing potential male participant agree practice adequate contraception . - Patients must significant medical illness active infection . - Patients must history cancer . - Patients must pregnant/breast feeding . - Patients must receive prior therapy bevacizumab , relate drug . - No active bleeding pathological condition carry high risk bleeding . - No major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day . Design : - This phase II study evaluate efficacy carboplatin bevacizumab treatment recurrent low grade anaplastic ependymoma . This trial design utilizing Simon optimal two-stage design . - Carboplatin give day 1 cycle . Bevacizumab administer day 1 15 cycle . The total duration treatment 6 cycle . After cycle 6 , carboplatin discontinue , bevacizumab may continue discretion treat physician . - Patients monitor hematologic serologic evidence myelosuppression , hepatic injury , renal injury , electrolyte disturbance clinical evidence toxicity .</detailed_description>

All patient must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must sign authorization release protect health information . Patients must &gt; 18 year old . Patients must Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( WBC &gt; 3,000/microliter , ANC &gt; 1,500/mm^3 , platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm^3 , hemoglobin &gt; 10 gm/dl ) , adequate liver function ( SGOT [ AST &lt; 92.5 Units/L ] bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL ) , adequate renal function ( creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 60 cc/min ) start therapy . Eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion . Patients must show unequivocal radiographic evidence tumor progression MRI CT scan . At time registration : Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy : &gt; 28 day investigational agent , &gt; 28 day prior cytotoxic therapy , &gt; 14 day vincristine , &gt; 42 day nitrosoureas , &gt; 21 day procarbazine administration , &gt; 7 day noncytotoxic agent , e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc . ( radiosensitizer count ) . Any question relate definition noncytotoxic agent direct Principal Investigator . Patients undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible long follow condition apply : They recover effect surgery . A minimum 28 day elapse day surgery day registration Step 2 . For core needle biopsy , minimum 7 day must elapse prior registration Step 2 . Residual disease follow resection recurrent ependymoma mandate eligibility study . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , CT/ MRI do later 96 hour immediate postoperative period least 4 week postoperatively , within 14 day prior consent . If within 96hour surgery scan 14 day consent scan need repeat . If steroid dose increase date imaging consent , new baseline MRI/CT require stable steroid dosage least 5 day . Patients must fail prior radiation therapy* must interval great equal 42 day completion radiation therapy study entry . Note : Patients indication craniospinal radiotherapy ( i.e. , extensive leptomeningeal disease ) refuse palliative craniospinal radiotherapy eligible . Patients prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation true progressive disease rather radiation necrosis base upon either PET Thallium scanning , MR spectroscopy , surgical/pathological documentation disease . Women childbearing potential must negative BHCG pregnancy test document within 14 day prior registration . Women childbearing potential male participant agree practice adequate contraception . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must significant medical illness investigator opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient ability tolerate therapy . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year ineligible . Patients must active infection serious intercurrent medical illness . Patients must pregnant/breast feeding . Patients must pregnant animal study show carboplatin bevacizumab teratogenic Patients must disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism . Patients must receive prior therapy bevacizumab , relate drug ( previous therapy carboplatin allow ) . Inadequately control hypertension ( define systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg ) despite antihypertensive medication .
