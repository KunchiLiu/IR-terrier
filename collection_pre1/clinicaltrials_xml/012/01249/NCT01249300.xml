	<brief_summary>Introduction Patients stroke may silent aspirator risk laryngeal penetration aspiration abnormal oropharyngeal function thus risk aspiration pneumonia serious effect . By provide identification component abnormal swallow , compare swallow across task , investigator may avoid aspiration instruct patient preventative compensatory swallow technique . Materials methods 1 . Oral examination-A neurologist speech pathologist examine patient 's swallowing function . The patient interview difficulty food intake , chew swallow meal . 2 . Ultrasound examination-Ultrasound creates image area inside body use sound wave . With patient sit position , 3/4-inch transducer ( device transmit receive sound wave ) place chin visualize epiglottis movement swallow . 3 . Modified barium swallow-While standing sitting , patient swallow 1/2 teaspoon flavor barium ( radioactive substance ) six time ( total 3 teaspoon ) , tongue pharynx ( tube lead mouth esophagus ) scan videotaped time epiglottis movement trace ultrasound . The barium give three consistencies-thin , medium thick ( pudding-like ) . The investigator study oral , pharyngeal upper esophageal phase swallow use videofluoroscopy correlate ultrasound trace epiglottis movement patient stroke condition . Most previous study swallow utilized diagnostic imaging technique provide complete swallowing assessment , limited capability screen large population patient . INCLUSION CRITERIA : The Stroke Center inpatients outpatient know suspected dysphagia include study well patient admit specifically protocol . ( Difficulty swallow food pill , change swallow ability , cough choke eating , shortness breath swallowing , food back mouth nasal passage , fever voice change swallow , pain swallowing , unexplained loss weight . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients severely demented severely compromise exclude sufficient cognitive ability follow direction . Non-ambulatory patient exclude brace support within fluoroscopy unit . Highly agitated individual also exclude unable remain confined equipment . Analytic Methods The Student test use analyze difference epiglottis movement swallow amongst different phase . Levene 's test equality variance apply examine variability epiglottis movement swallow group . All statistical analysis perform SPSS .</brief_summary>
