	<brief_summary>During surgery body temperature decrease adversely affect people recover surgery . This common problem . We aim reduce incidence drop body temperature surgery test effectiveness two active body warm device . One method warm intravenous fluid patient receive , infuse . The method use forced-air warmer . This device similar blanket patient lay upper body surgery warm air blow . The control group active warm method . Study group 1 intravenous fluid warmer pre- intraoperative period . Study group 2 forced-air warm intra-operative period well fluid warm pre- intraoperative period . We also observe neonate ' vital sign follow delivery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temperature Study Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potential participant approach member research team prior surgery . Patients fully inform study study investigator , full write informed consent obtain . We recruit healthy ASA 1 2 patient undergoing uncomplicated elective cesarean section . Patients randomise one three group . Control group active warming . Study group 1 pre- intraoperative intravenous fluid warm . Study group 2 study group 1 additional intraoperative warm use forced-air warming device . Temperature measurement take pre-op hold area prior intravenous fluid administration , thereafter 15-minute interval one hour post-surgery . At time temperature monitoring patient assess shiver ( 4 point scale ) ask comfort level regard temperature ( 5 point scale ) . We record vital sign ( measure routinely pediatricians cesarean delivery ) neonate immediately follow delivery . Samples blood take placental cord follow delivery measure cord blood gas result . We carry chart review look success rate breast feeding ( applicable ) . - We study effect intravenous fluid warm forced-air warm body temperature time cesarean section . - Perioperative hypothermia adverse affect health recovery follow surgery aim study find way prevent reduce incidence hypothermia . - Participants randomize one three group . The control group receive perioperative warming . Study group 1 intravenous fluid warm . Study group 2 group 1 addition forced-air warmer operating room . Your temperature take pre-op hold area prior intravenous fluid administration , thereafter 15-minute interval one hour post-surgery . At time temperature measurement also assess shiver may also question regard warm/cold feel . - Following delivery placenta send one blood sample take placental cord biochemistry laboratory analysis cord blood gas . The blood sample store future study . - We observe vital sign neonate immediately follow delivery . - We carry chart review look success rate breast feeding ( applicable ) .</detailed_description>
