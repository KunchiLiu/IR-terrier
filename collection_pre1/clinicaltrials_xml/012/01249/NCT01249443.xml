	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together paclitaxel carboplatin treat patient metastatic recurrent solid tumor human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving vorinostat together paclitaxel carboplatin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat Combination With Paclitaxel Carboplatin Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Solid Tumors HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability vorinostat combination paclitaxel carboplatin solid tumor patient HIV infection . II . To determine maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination patient population . *NOTE : An administrative decision make Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) halt study vorinostat specific patient population February 1 , 2013 , patient remain vorinostat . The primary objective go forward determine safety tolerability paclitaxel carboplatin combination patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily assess response rate therapeutic combination lung , head neck , esophageal cancer . II . To evaluate pathological characteristic non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) define cancer upper aerodigestive tract . III . To determine presence oncogenic activity human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection tumor tissue correlate HPV infection clinical outcome . IV . To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interaction paclitaxel antiretroviral therapy person HIV infection . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study vorinostat follow expansion cohort study . Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily day 1-5 paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically course 1 pharmacokinetic study HIV viral load analysis . Note : An administrative decision make CTEP halt study vorinostat specific patient population February 1 , 2013 . No patient remain vorinostat . The primary objective go forward determine safety tolerability paclitaxel carboplatin combination patient population , without vorinostat . The information pertain vorinostat historical purpose . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
