	<brief_summary>Removal central venous catheter ( CVC ) often useful prove responsibility bloodstream infection . To avoid unnecessary removal CVC , catheter-spearing diagnostic method recently develop . The aim study evaluate three catheter-spearing diagnostic method critically ill child : 1 ) measurement differential time positivity blood culture draw peripherical vein another one drawn CVC ; 2 ) exam blood sample drawn CVC stain acridine orange leucocyte cytospin test ; 3 ) semi-quantitative skin culture area around insertion site CVC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Samples three technique describe collected child admit Pediatric Intensive Care Unit CVC 48 hour clinical biological sign systemic infection . Any investigation require determine origin infection perform , accord physician 's judgement . If CVC remove change guide wire , quantitative culture distal segment perform . All patient bloodstream infection sample accord protocol include statistical analysis . The physician independent medical expert analyse bloodstream infection CVC-related , accord reference standard , analysis clinical bacteriological data , blind towards three study technique . The optimal threshold determine sensibility , specificity , positive negative predictable value three technique calculate . Then sensibility three technique compare .</detailed_description>
