	<brief_summary>MK-2206 newly discover drug may slow stop cancer growth . This drug use research study , information research study suggest MK-2206 may help slow stop growth malignant glioma . In addition , MK-2206 capacity cross blood-brain barrier . The blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) separation circulate blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) central nervous system ( CNS ) ; although serf protective barrier , often interfere potentially beneficial treatment reach brain successfully . Therefore , investigator hope MK-2206 successfully cross blood-brain barrier , effective patient . The purpose study see well MK-2206 work patient malignant glioma conduct two part : Part 1 Part 2 . Part 1 study investigate effect MK-2206 Akt signal tumor tissue . Ten patient recurrent GBM require reoperation receive short pre-operative course MK-2206 . After recovery surgery , patient resume MK-2206 disease progression development unacceptable toxicity . Part 2 trial initiate AFTER analysis Part 1 data show drug penetration tumor tissue ; significant drug penetration tumor and/or reduction pAkt level , progression Part 2 trial halt . The primary goal Part 2 determine therapeutic efficacy MK-2206 measure 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS6 ) . In Part 2 , 40 participant GBM 18 anaplastic glioma treat MK-2206 weekly dose select basis ongoing phase 1 study . Treatment duration measure 4-week cycle . Participants remain treatment tumor progression , long unacceptable toxicity . Responses assess clinical examination every 4 week MRI scan every 8 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants follow test procedure within 2 day first dose MK-2206 : medical history , physical examination , blood test , urine test EKG . - Participants Part 2 research study may also optional FDG-PET image do . If participant agrees , two PET scan perform ; one within week begin study drug , another within 3 day start study drug . - Participants Part 1 take MK-2206 orally prior surgery day 1-8 ( surgery MK-2206 dose day 8 ) . They EKG within 4-8 hour first dose MK-2206 , Day 8 . During surgery , sample tumor take research . The tumor tissue analyze measure level MK-2206 tumor study effect drug tumor . Genetic test do tumor tissue determine tumor 's genetic profile predict response treatment . You also 3 teaspoon blood drawn measure level MK-2206 blood . An assessment participant 's tumor MRI CT scan do within 96 hour surgery determine much tumor remove . One 4 week surgery ( within 14 day last MRI/CT scan ) , MK-2206 treatment restart schedule surgery ( weekly dosing ) . Within 2 day prior restart MK-2206 follow test procedure must complete : medical history , physical examination , blood test , urine test EKG . - Participants group receive MK-2206 mouth week ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ) . Participants receive EKG within 4-8 hour first dose MK-2206 ( Part 1 participant , day 1 pre-surgery ; Part 2 participant , day 1 first cycle treatment ) . Participants receive EKG weekly first cycle treatment MK-2206 . The following test procedure require within 2 day start subsequent 4-week cycle MK-2206 treatment : medical history , physical examination , blood test , urine test , EKG . Each treatment cycle last 4 week time participant take study drug week . In addition , patient also need follow tests/procedures perform treatment cycle : medical history physical examination Day 15 ( +/- 2 day ) Cycles 1 2 blood test weekly Cycle 1 Day 15 ( +/- 2 day ) cycle 2 . - Assessments tumor MRI perform within one week prior start odd-numbered cycle , start cycle 3 . - Participants continue receive study drug disease worsen develop unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm glioblastoma gliosarcoma . Participants eligible orginal histology lowgrade glioma subsequent histological diagnosis glioblastoma gliosarcoma make . Unequivocal evidence tumor progression MRI CT scan . A scan performed within 14 day registration . The type scan must use throughout period protocol treatment tumor measurement . MRI scan prefer whenever possible . If participant Part 2 study take corticosteroid , dose must stable decrease least 5 day prior scan . Must recover toxic effect prior therapy . From start schedule study treatment , follow time period must elapse : 4 week investigational agent , 4 week cytotoxic therapy , 4 week antitumor therapy . Must fail prior radiation therapy must interval least 12 week completion radiation therapy . Prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation progressive disease base upon nuclear imaging , MR spectroscopy , histopathology . Participants undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible long follow condition apply : ) recover effect surgery , b ) residual disease follow resection recurrent tumor mandate eligibility . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , MRI CT scan do later 96 hour follow surgery least 4 week postoperatively , either case within 14 day prior registration . If participant Part 2 study take corticosteroid , dose must stable decrease least 5 day prior scan . If steroid add steroid dose increase date screening MRI CT scan start treatment , new baseline MRI CT require . 18 year age old Life expectancy &gt; 8 week Karnofsky performance status 60 great Normal organ marrow function outline protocol At least 3545 paraffin slide ( standard thickness 4 micron ) prior surgery available correlative study Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Participants must register Ivy Consortium Tissue Data Study . Additional Part 1 Eligibility Criteria : Must deem site Investigator appropriate candidate surgical resection . Must frozen tumor sample ( minimum 100mg tissue ) prior surgery available correlative study Unequivocal evidence tumor progression MRI CT scan . For scan , increase corticosteroid dose acceptable . Additional Part 2 Eligibility Criteria : Subjects anaplastic gliomas meet eligibility criterion eligible . Participants receive therapy two prior relapse Prior treatment Akt inhibitor , PI3K inhibitor , mTOR inhibitor , antiangiogenic agent Must enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug .
