Analysis timeline procedures This document present pre-specified analysis plan primary manuscript ResPECT Study . This document finalize July 2016 approve ResPECT Study PIs . At time writing , final laboratory specimen sample test , database housing ResPECT data contain information clinic assign arm study . Once laboratory sample result obtain analysis plan upload registered clinicaltrials.gov , data coordinate center release label identify separate arm study ResPECT statisticians . The statistician use code implement analysis describe document . 2 . General outline analysis framework The ResPECT study cluster-randomized trial use constrain randomization ( i.e . match ) ensure balance across arm . The analysis describe document unmatched analysis , i.e . analysis explicitly account match . This described appropriate approach analyze data arise matched design . [ 1 ] The final analysis ResPECT Study outcome data consist intention-to-treat per-protocol analysis four study outcome define . For analysis , fit report result adjust unadjusted model . Unadjusted model analyze cluster-level , include main effect estimate mask cluster-level random effect account repeated measure cluster across multiple season . Adjusted model analyze individual-level include individual-level covariates random effect account repeated measure individual across season . 2.a Intention-to-treat analysis The intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis include ResPECT participant randomized— i.e. , assign mask base clinic affiliation . Their data include accord treatment assignment , regardless adherence protocol , subsequent withdrawal , failure provide request data/samples , loss follow-up . This analysis intend capture realistic outcome intervention acknowledge noncompliance protocol deviation unavoidable part clinical practice . For additional information ITT randomize control trial , see [ 2 ] . In study , person eligible accord baseline survey include ITT analysis . The outcomes many participant miss , particularly withdraw course study . This missingness could conceivably ( ) relate outcome/illness status individual likely quit study become sick , ( b ) relate assign intervention assign one mask another likely withdraw study participation . We assess possible relationship self-reported reason withdrawal measure variable . Approaches impute miss data address . 2.b Per-protocol analysis Any participant complete least eight week study participation include per-protocol analysis . This strategy include participant one blood draw miss reliable serological data due time lack information vaccination ( see Participant flow ResPECT study analysis approach show ITT Per Protocol cohorts Decision Algorithm serological influenza outcome adjudication ) . These inclusion/exclusion criterion decide study PIs ( see conference call meeting note March 21 , 2016 ) . The reason miss participant blood sample include loss follow-up without formal withdrawal/deactivation , sample loss due handling/labeling error , insufficient sample volume . Since serologic definition influenza seroconversion 4-fold increase titer , unpaired serology assign influenza seroconversion status must impute . Missing serologic data exclude patient PCR-laboratory assessment . Hence , individual miss second blood draw lab-confirmed influenza PCR , individual consider lab-confirmed influenza outcome . This may create non-random missingness , decide PIs since would impact many study participant risk bias overall study low . 2.c Handling miss data via imputation method There substantial miss data outcome ( lab-confirmed flu ) well covariates . The miss data impute use standard multiple imputation technique , create imputed datasets miss value analysis . Each datasets analyze use regression model describe . The result analyse pooled use standard multiple imputation technique combine estimate across imputed datasets . [ 3 ] Process determine participant membership ITT Per Protocol cohorts Participants consent . Those failed meet inclusion criterion complete screening exclude . Those met inclusion criterion randomly assign mask group formulate ITT cohort . The 'per protocol ' cohort include withdrew participate ( fill daily weekly survey ) , discontinue intervention ( withdraw less 8 week participation ) . The 'per protocol ' cohort include complete least 8 week study . We define , participant , amount time participate difference clinic activation date late either automatically-generated time-stamp last complete daily weekly survey collection date last swab , maximum 12 week . Those participate least 8 week ( 56 day ) accord calculation include 'per protocol ' cohort . For analysis use person time , use late follow ; last survey complete date collection date swab collection . Decision Algorithm serological influenza outcome adjudication This decision algorithm document process ResPECT participant determine laboratory-confirmed influenza base serological testing . The possible outcome : laboratory confirm influenza confirm serology ( LCI-S ) laboratory confirm influenza event confirm serology ( LCI-S ) . In case , outcome ( either LCI-S LCI-S ) impute . The algorithm classify and/or impute outcome follow . Step 1 : Determine Study Completion Determine participant complete study ( thus 'per protocol ' cohort ) thus ITT cohort Step 2 : Determine serological influenza outcome 'per protocol ' cohort 2a . For individual 'per protocol ' cohort two serological sample , collect begin end season accord protocol , experience four-fold rise influenza HI titer exactly 0 strain , classify serological influenza outcome LCI-S. 2b . For individual 'per protocol ' cohort two serological sample , collect begin end season accord protocol , experience four-fold rise influenza HI titer one strain , classify serological influenza outcome LCI-S. 2c . For individual 'per protocol ' cohort two serological sample , collect begin end season accord protocol miss vaccination info vaccinate study , impute serological influenza outcome LCI-S . Missing LCI-S status impute use standard multiple imputation technique , create multiple imputed datasets miss value analysis . Step 3 : Impute LCI-S outcome ITT cohort Some member ITT cohort complete week study may miss serological outcome reason mention . For individual , serological influenza outcome must impute . Missing LCI-S status impute use standard multiple imputation technique , create multiple imputed datasets miss value analysis . 2.d Model variable selection This data cluster-randomized clinical trial . We anticipate constrain randomization ensure balance across important covariates . The clinic pair-matched follow characteristic : Study site Clinic size Clinic type ( ED/Urgent care , Primary Care , Outpatient , Enhanced ) Enhanced PPE ( whether HCWs wear enhanced PPE patient procedure , e.g . dental dialysis clinic ) Patient population ( Pediatric , Adult , mix ) Because variable match , adjust multivariable regression model . However , cluster-level random intercept well additional participant-level covariates add model adjust possible residual confounding control cluster-randomized design . These covariates individual-level variable include : Age , Gender , Race ( White , Black African American , Asian , Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander , American Indian Alaskan Native ) ethnicity ( Hispanic Latino ) [ 4 ] Number household member 5 ( note strong risk factor influenza [ 5 ] ) , Categorical occupation risk level ( low , medium , high ) , Binary season-specific flu vaccination status ( vaccinate ) , Proportion daily survey individual report exposure someone respiratory symptom , Individual-level ( self-reported ) measure mask hand hygiene compliance . We attempt include above-listed variable analysis . No variable selection perform optimize goodness fit model [ 6 ] . No Type I error rate adjustment make . Variables leave contribute instability model estimation : e.g . collinearity ( identify variance inflation factor ) insufficient data impute covariate status . In model design stage , identify full set covariates would satisfy sample size recommendation [ 7 ] m/15 parameter model , = min ( n1 , n2 ) n1 n2 number response variable category . Based preliminary estimate total number influenza outcomes expect , aim keep number estimate parameter 25 . The following variable consider included analysis final model . Justification provide . Follow-up variable contact household member flu : noisy , lack flu confirmation , reliant self-reporting bias . Cumulative study-based vaccination status ( i.e . ever vaccinate , never vaccinate ) : would collinear seasonal vaccine status . Absence work : directly relate outcome , choose include average number hour work instead . Dummy variables clinic type : encode important question , n't main purpose central study , characteristic match . Size household : parsimony , include number household member 5 instead . Clinic size : use match randomization . Comorbid condition : hard justify include others , secondary relevance main outcome . Average number hour work per week define season individual : minimum number hour work defined inclusion criterion , range substantial . Smoking status : secondary relevance main outcome . 2.e Pre-specified exploratory analysis In addition pre-specified analysis primary secondary outcome , run several pre-specified exploratory analysis assess impact vaccine coverage protocol compliance study outcome . Using model describe Sections 3 4 , consider add additional covariates model primary secondary analysis . Specifically , examine impact covariates specific particular cluster-season include : Vaccine coverage among participant cluster Hand-hygiene compliance rate ( base observational data collect RAs ) Measure often HCW clinic wore mask , MM N95 ( base observational data collect RAs ) Proportion clinic HCW enrol study size clinic Additionally , assess interaction term consider follow variable : Interaction cluster-level mask compliance mask group Interaction individual-level vaccination status mask group Finally , investigate combination cluster-level , seasonal , individual-level cluster-seasonal random effect capture different possible correlation structure data . The magnitude variance component dictate whether include final model . 3 . Analysis plan primary outcome : laboratory confirm influenza 3.a Outcome definition A dichotomous variable indicate whether participant episode laboratory-confirmed influenza single influenza season . As specified protocol , individual PCR-confirmed influenza infection 4-fold rise antibody titer consider positive case . As described , implement per-protocol analysis ITT analysis . 3.b Planned descriptive analysis The descriptive analysis focus aggregate participant number across group specify Dr. Radonovich 's `` respect outcome tables.xlsx '' ( receive 01-11-2016 , revise 04-12-2016 ) . The table follow : 1 ) demographic , comprise breakout across treatment arm characteristic include age , race , gender , occupation , clinic characteristic , vaccination status , comorbid condition , 2 ) Adjudication , tally ResPECT participant broken category depend eligibility ITT Per-Protocol analyse influenza adjudication outcome year , 3 ) Nasopharyngeal swab lab result , participant break year mask type across possible influenza non-influenza virus test study , 4 ) Summary result lab-confirmed influenza , lab-confirmed non-influenza , ARI , ILI across intervention arm . 3.c Planned Primary Analysis We use individual-level logistic regression model estimate difference influenza infection N95 medical mask group . Let Y_ijs indicator whether subject cluster j develop laboratory-confirmed influenza season , MASK_js indicator mask clinic assign season ( 0 medical mask 1 N95 ) . Then fit version model logit [ Pr ( Y_ { ijs } =1|MASK_ { j } ) ] =Beta_ { 0 } +Beta_ { 1 } *MASK_ { j } +SUM_ { k } ( Theta_ { k } *X_ { k , ijs } +alpha_ { j } + alpha_ { } alpha_ { j } cluster-level random intercept , alpha_ { } individual-level random intercept ( assume normally distribute ) , X_ { k } refer individual-level covariates list Section 2.d . Unadjusted analyse drop individual-level covariates random intercept , retain cluster-level random effect . For fitted model , estimate odds ratio compare odds infection HCPs wear N95s compare HCPs wear medical mask ( i.e . exp ( Beta_ { 1 } ) report , 95 % CI . Our ITT per-protocol use model equation ( show ) use different subset participant full cohort describe . 3.d Planned Sensitivity Analysis To account unavoidable additional uncertainty regard miss data primary outcome , conduct sensitivity analysis randomly assign binary outcome participant complete study . Specifically , create two-dimensional grid vary influenza attack rate participant drop study medical mask ( MM ) N95 arm , separately . We fix MM dropout attack rate half twice observe MM attack rate , base complete data . We fix N95 dropout attack rate half twice observe N95 attack rate , base complete data . By vary two parameter across grid , combination , calculate adjust odds ratio ( average across n=50 impute datasets point grid ) , observe sensitivity result value miss data . Additionally , compare rate report symptomatic event two study arm . If detect statistically significant difference symptomatic reporting arm , include covariate adjustment person time model account amount person time observation . 4 . Analysis plan secondary outcomes 4.a Definitions secondary outcome : Acute Respiratory Illness ( ARI ) : This outcome incidence ARI clinical syndrome . ARI define occurrence sign symptom influenza infection , define Table 3 protocol , without laboratory confirmation . Influenza-Like Illness ( ILI ) : This outcome incidence ILI clinical syndrome . ILI define temperature 100°F [ 37.8°C ] great plus cough and/or sore throat , without laboratory confirmation . Laboratory Confirmed Respiratory Illness ( LCRI ) : This outcome define laboratory confirm respiratory illness pathogen list Table 4 protocol . Laboratory confirm respiratory illness ARI combine laboratory confirmation RT-PCR infection pathogen list Table 4 upper respiratory specimen swab symptom report within 4 day original symptomatic report ( per protocol definition LCRI confirm PI decision April 24 , 2016 ) . Events multiple virus detect count single event LCRI ( confirm PI decision 4/24/2016 ) . If swab test positive associate symptomatic event ( i.e . collect symptom onset four day symptom onset ) incident count LCRI event . If individual seroconverts influenza , symptoms time study , PCR-confirmed pathogen event already , assign single LCRI event ( PI decision 5/2/2016 ) . For endpoint , individual may experience outcome course 12-week study . Within study id , participant must report symptom-free least seven day prior begin second event ( per PI decision May 2 , 2016 ) . As primary endpoint section , secondary outcome analysis also include per-protocol ITT analysis . A general description approach provide , specific modification discuss . 4.b Planned secondary outcome ITT analysis As primary outcome ITT , analysis include randomize ResPECT participant regardless withdrawal status , participation , protocol adherence . Secondary outcome characterize use per-week rate infection participant may include . We use covariate-adjusted individual-level log-linear Poisson regression analysis person time offset term well cluster-level individual-level random intercept . For ITT analysis , amount person time fix 12 week participant , regardless much time participate study . We include covariates describe primary outcome analysis section Poisson regression model ITT per-protocol analysis . Unadjusted model include cluster-level random intercept . For fitted model , estimate incidence rate ratio N95 medical mask arm estimate report , 95 % CI . 4.c Secondary outcome per-protocol analysis Per-protocol analysis use Poisson regression method describe secondary outcome ITT analyse . Additionally , per-protocol analysis include ResPECT study participant complete least 8 week ( start time site activation ) 12-week trial . All randomized participant include unless withdrew , administratively withdrawn , deactivate participate least 8 week . Calculation person-weeks participant proceed follow : individual withdraw , completion date determine early withdrawal deactivation date ; event date conflict , early date use . For participant , active participation time calculated time clinic activation late either automatically-generated timestamp last complete daily weekly survey collection date last swab , 12 week . 4.d Missing covariate data secondary outcome The analysis approach secondary outcome encounter instance miss data , either NP swab result failure report relevant information self-reported form . Areas issue may require special handle 1 ) miss swab collection date , 2 ) miss swab result , 3 ) incomplete symptomatic event reporting . Missing swab collection date relevant match swab result symptomatic event report . Where data miss ( often case swab collect use take-home kit , participant self-collected NP sample ) , attempt match swab result symptomatic report event use swab number process elimination ( ie , one event report 1 symptomatic swab provide ) . Missing swab result may occur due practical consideration ( run PCR plate ) , participant noncompliance , handle error . These result truly miss , recover , therefore must discard . There also instance ( &lt; 30 &gt; 11,000 , &lt; 0.27 % ) result reliably match correct individual due barcode transcription error . These discard doubt correct assignment barcode . Since error arise systematic way comprise small portion overall available reliable swab sample , decision affect analysis outcome . A instance also exist participant provide symptomatic swab fail complete symptomatic event form . Since participant provide detail accompany biological specimen , include data analysis ILI event ( require specific symptom report ) . However , positive symptomatic swab data lack specific symptom data include ARI LCRI .
