	<brief_summary>Patient multiple metastasis , eligible surgery , might profit intensive chemotherapy regimen . Therefore less intensive regimen focus survival disease control may better choice first line treatment . Therefore study investigate combination capecitabine bevacizumab versus combination capecitabine , bevacizumab irinotecan . In case progressive disease , therapy patient treat capecitabine bevacizumab intensify add irinotecan . Primary endpoint time-of-failure strategy ( TFS ) compare treatment arm .</brief_summary>
