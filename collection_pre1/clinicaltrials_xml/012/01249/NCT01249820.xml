	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Anidulafungin ( Ecalta ® ) Intravenous Given Patients High Risk Developing Invasive Fungal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alternate dosing strategy echinocandin drug might provide good efficacy treatment fungal infection compare current label dosing strategy . Before conduct control efficacy trial echinocandins haematology patient , pharmacokinetics alternate dose strategy need test bring idea practice large randomise trial . Therefore want conduct pharmacokinetic study anidulafungin give every 48 hour every 72 hour . This research perform best group patient high risk develop invasive fungal infection . Recipients allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) patient receive intensive chemotherapy acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) relatively high risk develop invasive fungal infection therefore candidate primary prophylaxis . However , option limit fluconazole affords protection mould infections . Amphotericin B consider useful desoxycholate formulation many side effect lipid formulation expensive broad-spectrum triazoles itraconazole voriconazole prove value set . Anidulafungin first new class antifungal drug quite unlike others attack specifically ß 1-3 -D-glucan synthase cell wall . It relatively side effect appear safe effective treating Aspergillus Candida infection . Since two genus account 90 % fungal infection HSCT recipient drug would seem ideal candidate prophylaxis . Importantly , nothing know pharmacokinetics alternate dose regimen anidulafungin patient population . Therefore pharmacokinetic study homogenous cohort patient necessary test assumption , adequate exposure obtain alternate dose safe .</detailed_description>
