	<brief_summary>This clinical trial investigate effectiveness safety combination study drug bevacizumab AMG386 patient advance ( metastatic ) chemotherapy-naive bowel ( colorectal ) cancer . Chemotherapy significant impact metastatic bowel cancer term maintenance quality life extension survival . However , ultimately tumours develop resistance agent treatment option urgently require . Angiogenesis process result formation new blood vessel . Similar normal tissue , solid tumour require new blood vessel growth survival . Hence , drug target angiogenesis may useful treatment option patient bowel cancer . AMG386 bevacizumab act 2 different pathway relevant angiogenesis . There evidence laboratory animal study suggest combination could useful cancer treatment . Previous study human show AMG386 bevacizumab combine safely.. This study aim evaluate effectiveness safety combination AMG386 bevacizumab patient advance bowel cancer . 40 patient approximately four hospital Australia participate trial , approximately 20 patient enrol Austin Health . All participant receive treatment .</brief_summary>
