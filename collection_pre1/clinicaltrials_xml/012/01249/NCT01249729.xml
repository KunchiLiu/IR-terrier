	<brief_summary>We use three-dimensional image software reconstruct MRI . The propose research purpose follow : 1 . 3D reconstructed image processing MRI realize short term nervous system response dynamic acupuncture stimulation.2 . Realizing correspond area brain cause electroacupuncture . 3 . Realizing connection electroacupuncture stimulation brain physic , chemistry , physiology . The implement two-dimentional image three-dimensional image Amira software , order find difference pre-and post- response nervous system . In addition , use `` describe statistic '' `` Paired t-test '' statistical analysis , compare statistical difference blood oxygen concentration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We use three-dimensional image software reconstruct MRI . The propose research purpose follow : 1 . 3D reconstructed image processing MRI realize short term nervous system response dynamic acupuncture stimulation.2 . Realizing correspond area brain cause electroacupuncture . 3 . Realizing connection electroacupuncture stimulation brain physic , chemistry , physiology . The implement two-dimentional image three-dimensional image Amira software , order find difference pre-and post- response nervous system . In addition , use `` describe statistic '' `` Paired t-test '' statistical analysis , compare statistical difference blood oxygen concentration . Anticipate result : Using three-dimensional software reconstruct magnetic resonance image realize immediate response nervous system acupoint acupuncture stimulation , find meridian , nerve physiological corresponding relationship . It tremendous find world deliver brain mapping concern localization response central nervous system various acupoints stimulation .</detailed_description>
