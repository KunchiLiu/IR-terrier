	<detailed_description>Poor quality diet physical inactivity prevalent , preventable cause death United States . In particular , high saturate fat diet ( Fat ) , low fruit vegetable intake ( FV ) , low physical activity ( PA ) , high sedentary leisure screen time ( Sed ) co-occur heighten risk cardiovascular disease cancer . The first Make Better Choices ( MBC1 ) experiment contrast four strategy promote healthful change across four risk behavior . Each intervention target two behavior ( one diet , one activity ) simultaneously either increase healthy decrease unhealthy responding . The intervention target increase FV decrease Sed efficacious , yield unexpectedly sustain improvement three four risk behavior ( FV , Sed , Fat ) . The propose MBC2 trial test efficacy MBC intervention promote sustain , healthful change diet activity 6 12 month , contrast stress management control condition . MBC2 test compete hypothesis optimal way increase PA without undermine maintenance FV , Sed , Fat change multiple behavior either sequentially simultaneously . Furthermore , MBC2 examine mediator biomarkers healthy lifestyle change . Community dwell adult ( N=250 ) suboptimal diet inactive lifestyle randomize following condition : 1 ) Sequential MBC ( increase FV intake decreasing Sed , follow increase PA ) , 2 ) Simultaneous MBC ( increase FV , decrease Sed , increase PA ) , 3 ) Control ( stress management ) . Participants condition use Smartphones equip customized behavioral decision support tool self-monitor health behavior . These handheld device program automatically transmit data study server review personal behavior coach . Based theory self-regulation habit strength , Mastery hypothesis predict superior health behavior change participant randomize sequential condition . It anticipate effect mediate great habit strength healthy eating physical activity . However , base goal system theory , Synergy hypothesis predict superior health behavior change among participant randomize simultaneous condition . It anticipate effect mediate establishment superordinate healthy lifestyle goal . The result MBC2 trial assist researcher understand optimal manner facilitate multiple health behavior change population . Furthermore , data help identify mechanisms underlie healthy change among prevalent risk behavior . If successful , trial also result innovative , highly disseminable technology-supported minimal counseling intervention address American unhealthy diet sedentary lifestyle .</detailed_description>
