	<brief_summary>Primary biliary cirrhosis ( PBC ) cholestatic liver disease characterize progressive destruction small bile duct within liver lead end stage liver disease complication . Although ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) associate increased survival many patient PBC , absence adequate response UDCA significant proportion PBC patient . Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) cytokine play important role pathogenesis PBC . Other fibrosis biomarkers tissue metallo proteinase 1 ( TIMP-1 ) associate progression liver fibrosis PBC . Pentoxifylline ( PTX ) methylxanthine derivative inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine also show anti-fibrotic effect serum patient PBC . Furthermore , PTX well known clinical safety profile . The main hypothesis study therapy pentoxifylline ( PTX ) result improvement liver disease PBC patient incomplete responder UDCA . The focus proposal effectiveness PTX improve laboratory parameter liver disease level cytokine involve pathogenesis disease patient PBC .</brief_summary>
