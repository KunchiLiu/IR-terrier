	<brief_summary>Children treat brain tumor ( BT ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) show elevate rate work memory impairment . Working memory ( WM ) ability hold manipulate information online ; example , individual mentally rehearse phone number order dial without write . A computer-based working memory intervention successful child diagnose ADHD stroke survivor . Individuals participate intervention show improvement work memory measure well complex problem solve skill . Neuroimaging ( brain scan ) conduct training show change brain activation suggestive underlying change brain system support work memory . This study investigate effectiveness computer-based work memory intervention childhood cancer survivor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computerized Intervention Amelioration Cognitive Late Effects Among Childhood Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants randomize intervention arm complete computerize work memory training program . This computer-based training program complete home require approximately 30 minute every weekday five week . The program software guide child eight rotate exercise day , increase difficulty base child 's level performance . Exercises train visuospatial verbal WM use child-friendly activity . A research team member serve coach monitor weekly progress online offer support weekly phone call study participant caregiver . This individual complete post-intervention assessment maintain study blind . A home computer internet connection speaker require . A laptop computer and/or wireless internet access provide family whose obstacle participation lack computer access internet connectivity home setting . Families randomize WM intervention complete tutorial study staff provide instruction use computer , internet WM training software . The objective study investigate benefit work memory intervention sample childhood cancer survivor look brain-based change may occur result work memory intervention . To achieve goal , plan study childhood cancer survivor randomly assign work memory intervention passive waitlist . Both group participate cognitive test pre- , post- , six month post intervention . Intervention participant also partake neuroimaging exam intervention . Findings study direct potential support nonpharmaceutical cognitive intervention cancer survivor safe effective alternative stimulant medication great promise improve quality life .</detailed_description>
