	<detailed_description>Breast cancer patient often advise write list question talk surgeon oncologist treatment decision . However , without support , newly diagnose patient may overwhelm make list question . Over last 30 year , study show patient benefit researcher nurse prompt question concern may upcoming appointment primary healthcare provider . In study , researcher nurse write patient 's question clinician could sure address . Today , facility provide type patient support , know visit preparation , perhaps cost and/or organizational challenge . Our research team , partnership UCSF Decision Services Cancer Resource Centers Mendocino County ( CRCMC ) implement form visit preparation know Consultation Planning ( CP ) . The investigator make CP work community train resource center staff deliver service face-to-face interview patient . In recent complete Pilot Study , investigator collect analyzed initial data suggest CP appropriate diverse , rural patient Mendocino County ( include Native Americans Latinas ) , CP may effective deliver telephone . The investigator award grant examine effectiveness cost-effectiveness delivering CP telephone ( Tele-CP ) versus person . Primary Objectives : - To measure compare impact in-person CP Tele-CP decisional self-efficacy ( primary outcome ) , decisional conflict , anxiety , breast cancer-related quality life , adherence visit treatment . - To measure compare cost-effectiveness in-person CP Tele-CP Secondary Objective : • To measure physician satisfaction perception decision process . Study Hypotheses : 1 . Tele-CP deliver low patient resource center intervention cost in-person CP . 2 . Tele-CP patient reach level decisional self-efficacy ( primary outcome ) , decisional conflict , anxiety , quality life , adherence visit treatment in-person CP patient . 3 . Physicians report equal satisfaction rate decision process equally whether patient experience CP Tele-CP . In 1996 , Dr. Belkora colleague evaluate CP Stanford UCSF , find reduce perceived barrier communication improve satisfaction patient physician . CP available UCSF Cancer Resource Center since 1999 , advertise cancer patient brochures flyer . CP also integrate clinical process UCSF Breast Care Center since 1998 , offer every patient new locally recurrent disease face early-stage breast cancer treatment decision . In 2003 , Dr. Belkora award research funding California Breast Cancer Research Program implement Pilot Study entitle : Decision Support Rural Underserved North Coast Counties . This pilot project document , retrospective design , onsite Tele-CP associate high satisfaction decision self-efficacy level among rural cancer patient receive non-medical supportive service CRCMC . The investigator therefore conclude CP Tele-CP acceptable , feasible , viable intervention compare prospective randomize , control trial Mendocino County . The investigator also able conclude Decision Self Efficacy suitable primary outcome measure scientific community viewpoint . This study non-inferiority design use situation effective treatment already establish , case in-person CP . The goal prove , statistically , another treatment ( Tele-CP ) effective establish one , within predetermine margin non-inferiority . We therefore conduct randomize , control trial non-inferiority Tele-CP in-person CP . The outcome include decisional self-efficacy , anxiety , decisional conflict , disease-related quality life , adherence visit treatment , intervention cost patient resource center well physician satisfaction perception decision process . Approximately 90 Mendocino patient diagnose every year new locally recurrent breast cancer . An average 75 breast cancer patient per year become client CRCMC , receive non-medical supportive service agency . For example , resource center client match `` buddy '' survivor similar condition train provide emotional support . Clients also use resource center library attend support group . In past , offer in-person CP . Once study begin , resource center client diagnose stage 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 breast cancer schedule decision make appointment surgeon oncologist ask participate . Based updated preliminary data ( resource center 's 2007 record ) , investigator require 58 subject study period order make primary analysis study scientifically statistically valid , although continue accrue 116 patient order conduct secondary , exploratory , subset analysis . Clients consent participate study randomly assign Tele-CP in-person CP . A resource center staff member ( Consultation Planner `` CPer '' ) use assign method ( CP Tele-CP ) help patient prepare list question surgeon oncologist . Before CP Tele-CP session doctor 's appointment , client ask complete short survey describe confidence , anxiety , confusion , quality life , cost CP session ( e.g . travel time ) . From survey , well record , determine whether Tele-CP effective in-person CP , whether convenient le costly . Time 0 : - When patient breast cancer contact CRCMC information support , CRCMC staff ask client complete standard CRCMC Client Intake Form . Staff offer CP inquire client 's potential interest participate study . If client monolingual Spanish speaker , resource center staff enlist one designate translator assist communication consent process , utilize UCSF CHR approve Spanish Consent Form . If client potential interest study participation , refer member research team . The client also give copy UCSF CHR approve study consent form review . - A member research team review study protocol CRCMC client proceed informed consent process . - For frontier client ( live extremely remote area ) , consent process initiate phone member research team , copy consent form mail , fax , email subject . After subject chance read review consent , research team member address ( via telephone ) question concern may . If subject wish proceed study , sign consent forward back research team member fax US mail . - For subject easily meet person transportation challenge , research team member meet subject complete consent process person . Each consent process complete pursuant UCSF , State Federal Guidelines Protection Human Subjects . No study procedure initiate consent process complete subject sign study consent form . A copy consent give subject . A copy document also place subject 's CRCMC client file . This trial take place inland coastal office CRCMC locate Ukiah Mendocino . Interventions take place telephone one study arm , resource center office site ( Ukiah Mendocino , depend closer client domicile ) study arm . Patients randomize resource center arm , arrange transport , drive resource center staff member . Time 1 : • After informed consent obtain , research team member initiate study protocol procedure , obtain random assignment schedule patient appropriate CP intervention . Time 2 : • The Consultation Planner ( CPer , i.e . study interventionist ) meet client ( translator necessary ) either resource center telephone via conference call .
