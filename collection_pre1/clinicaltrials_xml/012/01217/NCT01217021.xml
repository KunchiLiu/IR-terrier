	<brief_summary>This research look brain may change people Alzheimer disease ( AD ) . The purpose research find whether change brain people Alzheimer disease detect use brain imaging test . Most people Alzheimer disease change brain result deposit protein call beta-amyloid . In study , investigator use radioactive drug , [ 18F ] MNI-558 bind beta-amyloid . This drug experimental approved FDA . Brain image use PET ( positron emission tomography ) do see investigator evaluate area beta-amyloid subject Alzheimer disease . The investigator compare scan do healthy normal volunteer . PET brain-scanning test use medicine scientific research see brain working . The PET image test use study do diagnostic purpose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Imaging With MNI-558</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 0 , open-label , single-center , non-randomized single dose study assess safety efficacy MNI-558 PET image detect amyloid beta plaque brain patient probable AD compare HVs . All aspect relate image acquisition , process visual well quantitative evaluation develop , optimize validate ( require ) . Each subject require visit study center screen phase , MNI-558 PET image day ( baseline ) , 1 follow-up visit next day . A telephone follow-up visit perform 7 day MNI-558 PET administration . At screen visit , subject caregiver ask provide write informed consent assent . During screen phase ( maximum duration - 28 day ) subject medical , neurological surgical history , clinical assessment neuro-psychiatric evaluation perform eligible subject . Subjects allow leave center evaluation complete . During period MRI brain must perform . During MNI-558 PET image day , subject receive single IV injection IMP scanning perform 0-60 min , 75-135 min , 150-210 min ( p.i ) . Each subject ask return site follow-up visit ( 20 28 hour IMP administration ) telephone follow-up occur 7 day thereafter . Safety assess follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
