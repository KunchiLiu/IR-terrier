	<brief_summary>The purpose Phase 1 study determine safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) oral ixazomib administer combination lenalidomide low-dose dexamethasone participant newly diagnose multiple myeloma ( NDMM ) . The purpose Phase 2 study determine overall response rate ( ORR ) evaluate tolerability toxicity combination oral ixazomib , lenalidomide , low-dose dexamethasone patient NDMM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Ixazomib Administered Combination With Lenalidomide Low-Dose Dexamethasone Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call ixazomib . Ixazomib test treat people newly diagnose multiple myeloma previously receive systemic treatment . This study conduct two Phases . Phase 1 looked side effect lab result people take ixazomib determine MTD RP2D . Phase 2 look overall response rate side effect people take ixazomib . The study enrol 15 patient Phase 1 50 patient Phase 2 . Participants Phase 1 assigned cohort receive ixazomib 1.68 , 2.23 , 2.97 , 3.95 mg/m^2 addition dexamethasone 40 mg lenalidomide 25 mg . Participants Phase 2 receive ixazomib 4.0 mg fix dose addition dexamethasone 40 mg lenalidomide 25 mg . In Phases study treatment administer 28-day Cycles follow : ixazomib Days 1 , 8 15 , dexamethasone Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 , lenalidomide 25 mg Days 1 21 . This multi-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 12 , 28-day cycle option continue maintenance portion absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Participants make multiple visit clinic final visit 30 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
