	<brief_title>Study Abiraterone Acetate Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study collect information adverse event ( side effect ) occur treatment abiraterone acetate patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . To participate study patient must fail 1 2 chemotherapy regimen ( 1 contain taxane docetaxel ) , reside area abiraterone acetate yet available local healthcare provider , eligible enrollment ongoing clinical research study abiraterone acetate . CRPC progressive form prostate cancer cancer cell become resistant hormonal therapy design block release uptake testosterone cancer cell metastasize ( ie , spread part body ) . Abiraterone acetate ( referred abiraterone ) drug currently development use treat men CRPC . Patients treat abiraterone prednisone daily progression clinical disease ( ie , include sign clinical disease progression and/or clinical disease progression confirm radiographic prostate-specific antigen [ PSA ] test result ) . Other reason discontinuation treatment may include adverse event report , initiation anticancer therapy , patient 's inability comply dose instruction . Patients follow 30 day discontinuation treatment abiraterone acetate . Patients take four 250-mg tablet abiraterone orally least 1 hour meal 2 hour meal time 10 pm every day . Patients also take 5 mg oral prednisone , twice daily . Each treatment cycle consist 28 day patient take abiraterone continually daily basis disease progression observe time abiraterone discontinue dose prednisone reduce clinically indicate .</detailed_description>
