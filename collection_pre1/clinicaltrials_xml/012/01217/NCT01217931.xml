	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare 6 different 2-drug `` sequence '' everolimus , bevacizumab , pazopanib learn may affect metastatic kidney cancer . For 2-drug sequence , participant receive 1 drug may start take another drug . Researchers also study safety 2-drug sequence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Two-agent Assessment Renal Cell Carcinoma Therapy : The START Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Everolimus design block growth cancer cell , may cause cancer cell die . Bevacizumab design block growth blood vessel supply nutrient necessary tumor growth . This may prevent slow growth cancer cell . Pazopanib design block protein may cause uncontrolled tumor growth . Blocking protein may prevent cancer grow spread . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 6 group . There equal chance assign group . - Group 1 receive pazopanib , possibly follow bevacizumab . - Group 2 receive pazopanib , possibly follow everolimus . - Group 3 receive everolimus , possibly follow bevacizumab . - Group 4 receive everolimus , possibly follow pazopanib . - Group 5 receive bevacizumab , possibly follow pazopanib . - Group 6 receive bevacizumab , possibly follow everolimus . If disease get bad receive first assign drug , stop take drug . Then side effect , start take second assign drug 2-4 week later . Everolimus take mouth 1 time per day ( time day ) . Bevacizumab give vein 30-90 minute , 1 time every 2 week . Pazopanib take mouth 1 time per day ( time day empty stomach ) . You may able receive bevacizumab dos local doctor 's office . Ask study doctor . Study Visits : Every week Weeks 1-4 , blood pressure check ( either home , clinic , local doctor ) take pazopanib bevacizumab . If check blood pressure home , keep log write blood pressure . Bring log next clinic visit . Every 2 week , urine collect routine test receive bevacizumab . Every 4 week : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take . - You ask side effect may . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If receive everolimus , fast ( nothing eat drink except water ) start night test . The doctor discus . - Urine collect routine test receive everolimus pazopanib . Every 8 week , follow test procedure perform . If receive study treatment local doctor 's office , must return MD Anderson test procedure . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If receive pazopanib , blood also use check thyroid function . - You CT scan chest abdomen check status disease . - You fill 5 questionnaire quality life feeling . This take 30 minute . Every year , MRI brain check status disease . Every year , ECHO MUGA scan check health heart . Anytime doctor decides need , scan CT scan pelvis , MRI scan abdomen brain , ECHO MUGA scan , and/or bone scan . After 1 year , disease gotten bad , may less clinic visit test . Length Participation : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug intolerable side effect occur , disease get bad take second assign study drug . End-of-Treatment Visit : When finish take study drug ( ) : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask drug may take . - You ask side effect may . Long-Term Follow-Up : After End-of-Treatment visit , study staff contact phone , e-mail , come clinic visit . You ask feel side effect may . Each follow-up take 5 minute . Follow-up take place every 3 month first 2 year , every 6 month third year , 1 time year . The last follow-up 5 year last patient enrol . This investigational study . Everolimus , bevacizumab , pazopanib FDA approve commercially available kidney cancer . The investigational part study find order drug give . Up 240 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
