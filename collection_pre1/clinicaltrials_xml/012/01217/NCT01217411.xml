	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose RO4929097 ( gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 ) give together whole-brain radiation therapy stereotactic radiosurgery see well work compare whole-brain radiation therapy stereotactic radiosurgery alone treat patient breast cancer cancer ( lung cancer melanoma ) spread brain . RO4929097 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Whole-brain radiation therapy use high energy x-ray deliver radiation entire brain treat tumor see . Stereotactic radiosurgery may able deliver x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . It yet know whether give RO4929097 together whole-brain radiation therapy stereotactic radiosurgery may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) phase II dose RO4929097 combine whole-brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) . ( Phase I ) II . Determine safety profile RO4929097 combine WBRT . ( Phase I ) III . Determine MTD phase II dose RO4929097 combine stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) . ( Phase I ) IV . Determine safety profile RO4929097 combine SRS . ( Phase I ) V. Determine whether addition RO4929097 WBRT SRS significantly increase percentage estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patient brain metastasis achieve response ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) brain 12-week ( 3-month ) time point cranial radiotherapy . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Correlate response time progression : pre- post-therapy tumor archive tumor tissue expression molecular stem cell marker ; pre- post-therapy plasma biomarkers ; change pre- post-therapy tumor archive tumor tissue expression molecular stem cell marker first 5 day therapy change pre- post-therapy plasma biomarkers course therapy ; Notch positive Notch negative tumor , first 5 day therapy RO4929097 , compare tumor tissue expression molecular stem cell marker . ( Phase I II ) II . Determine progression free survival ( PFS ) brain treatment arm . ( Phase II ) III . Determine percentage patient alive disease free ( brain ) 6 month . ( Phase II ) IV . Determine local control rate ( brain ) 24- 48-week time point cranial radiotherapy treatment arm . ( Phase II ) V. Determine distant failure rate ( brain ) 24- 48-week time point cranial radiotherapy treatment arm . ( Phase II ) VI . Determine PFS body treatment arm . ( Phase II ) VII . Determine systemic response rate . ( Phase II ) VIII . Determine percentage patient alive without progression systemically 6 month . ( Phase II ) IX . Further describe safety profile treatment arm . ( Phase II ) X . Compare neurocognitive outcome treatment arm . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 follow randomized phase II study . PHASE I : Patients &gt; = 4 brain lesion receive RO4929097 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-3 weekly begin 1 day prior first day WBRT continue 6 week ( 42 day ) completion radiation therapy . Patients &gt; = 4 brain lesion also undergo whole-brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) daily , 5 day week , 2-4 week begin day 2 . Patients = &lt; 3 brain lesion receive RO4929097 PO QD day 1-7 week 1 2 day 1-3 subsequent week begin 2 day prior first day SRS continue 6 week ( 42 day ) completion radiation therapy . Patients = &lt; 3 brain lesion also undergo stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) day 4 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients &gt; = 4 brain lesion undergo WBRT phase I patient = &lt; 3 brain lesion undergo SRS phase I . ARM II : Patients &gt; = 4 brain lesion receive RO4929097 undergo WBRT phase I patient = &lt; 3 brain lesion receive RO4929097 undergo SRS phase I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 52 week .</detailed_description>
