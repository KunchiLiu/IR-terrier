	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose MEK Inhibitor AZD6244 give together cetuximab patient advance refractory solid tumor remove surgery . MEK inhibitor AZD6244 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving MEK Inhibitor AZD6244 together cetuximab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose limit toxicity maximum tolerate dose AZD6244 combination cetuximab advance , refractory solid tumor . II . To assess evidence anti-tumor activity combination , per tumor measurement use RECIST criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetics AZD6244 cetuximab administer concomitantly . II . To evaluate safety tolerability combination AZD6244 cetuximab patient K-RAS mutate metastatic colorectal cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess inhibition RAF/MEK/ERK pathway peripheral blood mononuclear cell secondary treatment AZD6244 . II . To evaluate pharmacokinetics AZD6244 combination cetuximab relation treatment side effect . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study MEK inhibitor AZD6244 . Patients receive oral MEK inhibitor AZD6244 twice daily day 1-28 cetuximab IV 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study pharmacokinetic biomarker analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
