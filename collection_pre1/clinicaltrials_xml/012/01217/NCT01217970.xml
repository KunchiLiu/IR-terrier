	<detailed_description>This study design collect data determine whether medication , ibudilast , safe use potential treatment methamphetamine-dependent people . For 18 year Japan South Korea , ibudilast use safely humans treatment asthma , pulmonary , cardiovascular disease . It know whether ibudilast safe use outpatient setting people methamphetamine dependence . This would first study collect information . This study important individual methamphetamine dependence often relapse meth use , even treatment ; number individual participate outpatient study relapse methamphetamine take ibudilast . It crucial know whether may interactions ibudilast methamphetamine planning outpatient clinical trial . The study conduct Harbor-UCLA hospital ensure medical safety participant , especially unexpected interaction ibudilast methamphetamine cardiovascular function . Methamphetamine cause substantial increase heart rate blood pressure last 3 hour . This study measure whether people meth-dependent ( look treatment ) show increase heart rate blood pressure give methamphetamine expect methamphetamine alone recommend dos ibudilast . Ibudilast exciting medication candidate treat methamphetamine dependence . When individual become abstinent methamphetamine early recovery , body start inflammatory process neuron , especially glial cell . Glial cell important provide support nerve cell involve thought , movement , human activity . By dampen inflammation glial cell , ibudilast may preserve glial nerve cell early abstinence , turn may help individual feel well think well treatment . The study specific aim determine whether ibudilast alters : 1. blood pressure heart rate response methamphetamine ; 2. rating crave drug experience methamphetamine ; 3. reward/reinforcing effect methamphetamine ; 4. metabolism methamphetamine . Over enrollment period 24 month , 12 methamphetamine-dependent participant look treatment complete study . Each participant complete assessment safety/tolerability , perceive effect methamphetamine , assessment subject make choice different amount money methamphetamine . Each patient stay hospital total 27 night . The first two day consist safety infusion make sure methamphetamine tolerable . Then , subject start study medication take 7-day course three condition : placebo , ibudilast 20mg BID , ibudilast 50mg ibudilast . Low dose ibudilast always precedes high dose ibudilast . The order placebo first last random .</detailed_description>
