	<brief_title>Erlotinib Neoadjuvant Treatment Patients With Stage ⅢA N2 NSCLC With Activating EGFR Mutation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening phase : Patients clinically diagnose stage ⅢA N2 lung caner CT technique pathologically proven NSCLC N2 EBUS . The pathology specimen detect EGFR mutation DNA sequencing . The patient EGFR mutation exon 19 21 enrol study . Neoadjuvant treatment phase : Patient receive erlotinib 150mg/day . Treatment schedule continue total 8 week disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Surgery treatment phase : Tumor response evaluate CT scan 8 week induction treatment . The patient responsive disease consider technique resectable undergo resection . Post-surgery phase : It discretion investigator whether patient candidate post-operative treatment consider best interest patient . It recommend patient positive margin residual tumor surgery receive radiation therapy . Patients surgery receive long-term follow-up include chest CT scan every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written inform consent provide . Males female age ≥18 year . Able comply require protocol followup procedure , able receive oral medication . Stage IIIA N2 NSCLC accord pathological evidence endobronchial ultrasound ( EBUS ) . The biopsy specimen show EGFR mutation exon 19 21 DNA sequencing . Measurable disease must characterize accord RECIST criterion : measurable lesion define accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥20cm conventional technique ( PE , CT , XR , MRI ) ≥ 10cm spiral scan . ECOG performance status 01 . Life expectancy ≥12 week . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding . The biopsy specimen show EGFR wildtype exon 19 21 DNA sequencing .
