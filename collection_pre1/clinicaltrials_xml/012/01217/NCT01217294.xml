	<brief_summary>Pain control hip replacement surgery important ensure patient comfort , allow mobilisation , aid recovery . The investigator propose simple pragmatic study compare two different anaesthetic technique provision pain relief hip surgery . Patients randomise receive either spinal anaesthesia contain morphine spinal anaesthesia without morphine ultrasound guide fascia iliaca nerve block . Although morphine effective pain killer , side effect include itch , urinary retention , nausea potentially fatal breathing problem . If nerve block show provide comparable pain relief spinal morphine , morphine could remove spinal injection . This could reduce side effect improve patient safety . The investigator wish investigate whether ultrasound guide fascia iliaca plane block provide analgesia comparable intrathecal opioid primary hip arthroplasty first 24 hour hip replacement surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Nerve Block With Spinal Opiate Provide Pain Relief Hip Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 6312 primary hip replacement perform Scotland one year period 2007 - 2008 . Patients undergo hip arthroplasty commonly significant comorbidity associate polypharmacy provide many potential challenge anaesthetic doctor . The optimal way anaesthetise patient remain fully establish although many potential method exist . The main choice general anaesthesia ( GA ) regional anaesthesia ( RA ) combination two . In recent systematic review , RA find reduce post-operative pain , morphine consumption nausea vomit compare systemic analgesia . Spinal anaesthesia popular form RA use many patient undergo hip arthroplasty . Opioid drug frequently add spinal injection order prolong post-operative pain relief . However , associated side effect include respiratory depression , urinary retention , nausea vomiting , pruritus . Such adverse effect may uncomfortable patient delay mobilisation , recovery eventual discharge . In patient undergo hip arthroplasty , peripheral nerve blockade show improve pain score reduce morphine consumption . A peripheral nerve block call fascia iliaca plane block show significant promise method provide sensory blockade main nerve supply pain hip . The use ultrasound performance fascia iliaca plane block show increase reliability compare landmark technique though clinical benefit yet fully investigate . Compared nerve stimulation landmark technique nerve localisation , ultrasound show increase success rate , reduce block onset time , increase block duration , reduce volume local anaesthetic require increase patient satisfaction . The investigator hypothesise increase success rate fascia iliaca block ultrasound , possible achieve superior analgesia post-operatively . Our aim ass whether ultrasound guide fascia iliaca plane block use alternative intrathecal morphine provision post-operative analgesia primary hip arthroplasty . If case , intrathecal opioid could remove spinal anaesthetic . This could theory significant safety benefit whilst also reduce side effect . Ultrasound guide fascia iliaca block yet evaluate clinically method provide post-operative analgesia follow primary hip arthroplasty . The investigator believe investigation technique provide valuable contribution exist knowledge change current practice .</detailed_description>
