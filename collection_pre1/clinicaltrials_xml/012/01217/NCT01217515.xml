Subjects undertake 1-week screening period provide baseline data assessment eligibility . At Baseline visit ( Week 0 ) , eligible subject ( average Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) score &gt; 4 bad pain associate follow defaecation ) randomise 1:1:1 basis one three treatment group . Subjects receive diltiazem hydrochloride 2 % cream diltiazem hydrochloride 4 % cream placebo cream . Study treatment apply around anus , three time daily , 8 week .

Routine blood sample take Skin Irritation Score ( SIS ) record safety evaluation . Subjects may receive permitted medication pain per Entry Criteria , remain stable , possible , Week 8 Visit . Introduction new medication AF permit unless Investigator deem `` rescue '' intervention necessary . A subject deem treatment failure rescue intervention require withdrawn study . Any subject leaving study follow randomisation reason ask complete Early Withdrawal Visit . This include subject withdraw due development AEs intolerance , well subject require rescue intervention . These subject return safety follow-up visit previously schedule follow-up assessment appointment . If complete healing occur 2 4 Week visit , ( i.e . prior end 8-week treatment period ) , subject ask continue apply medication full 8 week course , final assessment . Following Week 8 visit ( Early Withdrawal Visit ) , subject follow 4 week ( follow cessation study medication ) note AEs .
