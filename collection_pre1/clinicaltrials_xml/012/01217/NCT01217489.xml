	<brief_summary>The Signascan Electrical Impedance Mammography ( EIM ) Study pilot study non-invasive medical device - novel approach breast cancer detection use Electrical Impedance Mammography ( pass minute electrical current tissue detect change current result tissue , differentiate normal malignant tissue ) . The trial prospective trial diagnostic capability device , compare standard care ( diagnosis provide concurrent NHS investigation - imaging , surgery etc ) perform female patient attend symptomatic breast clinic investigation . The aim ass diagnostic efficacy detect 100 true malignancy , continue recruit 300 patient true malignancy recruit necessary .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Into Use Electrical Impedance Mammography Diagnosis Characterisation Breast Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective - To test accuracy identification breast malignancy , localisation tissue characterisation , utilise non-invasive / non-ionising imaging technique Electrical Impedance Mammography Secondary Objectives - Comparative analysis image modality detect malignant breast disease . Since Signascan EIM image undertake parallel imaging modality possible perform comparative analysis . - Determination whether Electrical Impedance Mammography ( EIM ) also use identify tissue-characterise range benign clinical breast mass . Summary Study Design A pilot study system impedance-based breast screening , design prospective diagnostic pilot study . The procedure study 'additive ' , run parallel exist NHS care , therefore normal investigation treatment withheld . All participant involvement one visit hospital , visit patient would make anyway course routine NHS care pathway . Participation last time take discus , consent ( 15 min ) perform ( 10 min ) scan . Therefore total duration involvement approximately 25 minute . The pilot study run period two year , aim include 300 case malignant breast disease . Interim analysis perform first 100 patient . Concepts blinding/randomization apply would therapeutic trial . Control data come patient ' ( normal ) contralateral breast , group patient scan subsequently diagnose benign disease . 5.2 Primary Secondary Endpoints/Outcome Measures Primary Outcome Measure : Determination success rate Signascan EIM method accurately detect presence malignancy breast , report malignancy normal breast . ( Accuracy ' measure degree sensitivity ( % ) specificity ( % ) proven pilot study population . ) Secondary Outcome Measures : Determination ability Signascan EIM method differentiate different type malignancy ( i.e . discern difference ductal lobular carcinoma ) . Determination ability Signascan EIM method differentiate different type benign tissue ( i.e . discern difference cystic fibroadenomatous change ) . Study Participants Participants include woman refer NHS investigation symptomatic breast lump , follow self-examination pick GP . They generally age range 40-60 year eligible patient 18 yr exclude study basis age . Study Procedures All study procedure perform one visit schedule exist NHS care . Beforehand , possible , potential participant letter one-page information sheet send letter invite NHS appointment . Since 1st January 2010 , referral breast clinic must see within 14 day , therefore advance write notice possible many appointment make telephone . In instance patient offer 1 page information sheet report clinic reception . They time read consider wait see wait investigation perform . In instance judgment make responsible clinician whether appropriate invite patient join study . In order , procedures clinic ( total time 20-25 min ) : 1. verbally invite potential participant study , go full-length PIS 2. answer question conduct informed consent 3. participant change gown 4. position participant scan couch 5. push button perform scan 6. participant dress free go . Informed Consent Written verbal version Informed consent present subject detail le : exact nature study ; implication constraint protocol ; know side effect risk involve take part . It clearly state participant free withdraw study time reason without prejudice future care , obligation give reason withdrawal . The participant allow much time wish consider information , opportunity question Principal Investigator , GP independent party decide whether participate study . Written Informed Consent obtain mean subject dated signature , signature person present informed consent , different , Principal Investigator ( name Co-Investigator ) . A copy sign Informed Consent give subject . The original signed form retain study site . Study Assessments The assessment confirm eligibility data necessary study perform participant ' ordinary NHS healthcare professional ( John Radcliffe breast surgery team Miss Jane Clarke ( Consultant breast surgeon ) associate team surgeon nurse staff ) . The assessment per standard NHS first-line assessment symptomatic breast lesion population study . This tend include clinical history-taking , clinical breast examination , standard scan method appropriate . Specific data retain study purpose , include demographic data detail medical history disease process may affect study . This would include breast disease either breast , prior surgery , significant systemic comorbidities . Additionally , since hormone status may affect impedance profile breast tissue , data date menstrual cycle collect also . Miss Clarke team identify approach suitable patient invite join study , assessment visit .</detailed_description>
