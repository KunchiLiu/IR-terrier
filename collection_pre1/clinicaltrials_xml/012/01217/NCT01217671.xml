	<brief_title>International Study Evaluating Safety Efficacy Inhaled , Human , Alpha-1 Antitrypsin ( AAT ) Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficient Patients With Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency , also call Alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor ( API ) deficiency , genetic disorder characterize production abnormal amount AAT protein reduce circulating level protein . Subjects AAT deficiency increase risk develop Emphysema . It believe result chronic activity elastase release cell continually present lung low number . Three blind interim analysis show safety issue concern regard tolerability .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Principal Diagnosis emphysema confirm CT scan . If report past CT scan available site document CT scan perform screen Male female patient least 18 year age . Able willing sign inform consent . Patient record congenital AAT deficiency phenotype PiZZ ( homozygote ) rare phenotype relate AAT deficiency AAT serum level ≤ 11 micromole . For patient receive IV AAT augmentation therapy serum AAT level threshold apply . FEV1/SVC &lt; 70 % predict value post bronchodilator ( SVC slow VC ) FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict value postbronchodilator History least two moderate severe exacerbation require change treatment ( antibiotic , systemic steroid , hospitalization ) last 18 month prior date screening , least one occur within last 12 month prior screen . Ability comply completion electronic diary . Ability selfadminister inhale AAT . No significant abnormality serum hematology , serum chemistry serum inflammatory / immunogenic marker accord Principal Investigator 's judgment , take consideration potential effect AAT deficiency . No significant abnormality urinalysis accord Principal Investigator 's judgment , take consideration potential effect AAT deficiency . No significant abnormality ECG per investigator judgment . Negative HBsAg antibody HCV , HIV1 . AAT deficient patient either naïve ( receive IV augmentation therapy ) AAT deficient patient ( receive IV augmentation therapy ) , stable regular therapy least 3 month prior screen visit willing continue regime throughout trial . Note sit Germany recruit patient currently treat IV AAT.Patients stop IV augmentation treatment 6 month prior screen date restart treatment course study consider Naïve . Nonpregnant , nonlactating female patient , whose screening pregnancy test negative use contraceptive method deem reliable investigator , least 2 year postmenopausal surgically sterilize . Principal FEV1 &gt; = 80 % FEV1 &lt; 20 % predict value postbronchodilator . FEV1/SVC &gt; =70 % History lung transplant . Any lung surgery within past two year . On thoracic surgery wait list . End last exacerbation less 6 week prior screening/rescreening visit . Clinically significant intercurrent illness ( except respiratory liver disease secondary AAT deficiency ) , include : cardiac , hepatic , renal , endocrine , neurological , hematological , neoplastic , immunological , skeletal ) opinion investigator , could interfere safety , compliance aspect study . Patients wellcontrolled , chronic disease could possibly include consultation treat physician sponsor . Active smoking last 12 month screen date . Pregnancy lactation . Woman childbearing potential take adequate contraception deem reliable investigator . Presence psychiatric/ mental disorder medical disorder might impair patient 's ability give inform consent comply requirement study protocol . Evidence ongoing viral infection HCV , HBV and/or HIV . Evidence alcohol abuse history alcohol abuse illegal and/or legally prescribe drug . IgA Deficiency History life threaten allergy , anaphylactic reaction , systemic response human plasma derive product . Participation another clinical trial within 30 day prior baseline visit . Inability attend schedule clinic visit and/or comply study protocol . Any factor , opinion investigator , would prevent patient comply requirement protocol .</criteria>
