	<detailed_description>The Study Treatment : 5-fluorouracil docetaxel design stop growth cancer cell , may cause cell die . Docetaxel may also damage blood vessel tumor tissue . The radiation therapy study either intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , form photon-based radiation therapy , proton beam therapy ( PBT ) . This doctor . Both IMRT PBT design give radiation tumor area limit radiation exposure nearby organ lung , heart , spinal cord . The surgery study remove part esophagus nearby lymph node . The type surgery doctor 's decision base location tumor esophagus . It either laparoscopic surgery ( minimally invasive procedure small hole make abdomen ) open surgery ( chest wall ) . Study Treatment Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive radiation therapy chemotherapy follow schedule 5 1/2 week . If holiday schedule treatment day , schedule may slightly different study staff discus . - Radiation therapy give Monday Friday . This take 30 minute , include 10-15 minute radiation treatment . - 5-fluorouracil give vein , continuously 96 hour week ( Monday Friday ) . - Docetaxel give vein 1 hour , 1 time week ( Mondays ) . 5-fluorouracil give use portable pump size personal CD player . You need carry portable pump 96 hour week . Docetaxel give central venous catheter . A central venous catheter sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . The catheter remove end Week 5 . Before every dose docetaxel , receive dexamethasone low risk side effect . Dexamethasone give vein second . Your doctor let know eligible surgery . In study , surgery must perform within 8-10 week finish chemotherapy radiation therapy . You ask sign separate consent form describe surgery anesthesia ( numbing medicine ) risk detail . The screening test help doctor decide eligible surgery include scan endoscopy describe ( 4-6 week radiation chemotherapy ) . You longer able receive radiation chemotherapy disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . You able surgery doctor decide surgery best interest ( example , disease general health get bad ) . Study Visits : During Study Therapy : Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test Week 3 radiation chemotherapy . Follow-Up : At 4-6 week last dose radiation chemotherapy , follow test procedure perform : - You CT scan chest whole-body PET/CT scan check status disease . - You may endoscopy esophagus 1 biopsy tumor check status disease . The number biopsies doctor 's decision time procedure , base status location disease . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You fill 3 quality-of-life questionnaire . This take 10-15 minute . About 4 week surgery , fill 3 quality-of-life questionnaire . You fill 2 quality-of-life questionnaire 6 routine follow-up visit surgery . Every 3-6 month first 3 year last dose radiation chemotherapy , every 6 month next 2 year , every year , follow test procedure perform : - You CT scan chest whole-body PET/CT scan check status disease . - You endoscopy esophagus check status disease every follow-up visit Year 1 . After , endoscopy esophagus follow-up visit anytime doctor decides need . You 1 tumor biopsy follow-up visit doctor decides need , base status location disease . This decide time endoscopy . Biomarker Testing : If leftover tumor tissue available join study , leftover tissue use genetic biomarker testing . If leftover tumor tissue available join study , leftover tissue study procedure use genetic biomarker test . This investigational study . Docetaxel 5-fluorouracil FDA approve commercially available treat esophageal cancer . However , investigational give drug patient early-stage esophageal cancer . It investigational give combination chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery patient early-stage esophageal cancer . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
