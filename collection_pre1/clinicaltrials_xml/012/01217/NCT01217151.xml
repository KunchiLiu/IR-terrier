	<brief_summary>In last year , grow interest improvement prognosis shorten hospital length stay high-risk surgical patient . Several evidence-based protocol ( `` fast-track '' surgery ) develop implement hospital purpose . Cardiovascular optimization so-called `` goal-directed therapy '' ( GDT ) key element protocol . Previous study literature use invasive monitor ass hemodynamics . The NICOM ™ non-invasive monitor validate several clinical scenario . The aim present randomize , international , multi-center , open-label clinical trial use GDT protocol ( include colloid bolus vasoactive drug infusion ) base data obtain NICOM™ device ( cardiac index mean arterial pressure ) test hypothesis GDT superior standard practice term reduction incidence perioperative complication length hospital stay high-risk major abdominal surgery patient ( require ICU surveillance , least , 24 hour ) . As secondary objective , time first flatus , wound infection , anastomotic leak mortality analyse . All patient follow day surgery hospital discharge ( determined specialist surgeon involve study ) death .</brief_summary>
