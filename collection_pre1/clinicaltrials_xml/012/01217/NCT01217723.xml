	<brief_summary>This randomized trial patient undergoing hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation ( HPCT ) unrelated donor . Approximately 50 % patient enrol receive Thymoglobulin® part preparative regimen prior HPCT . The 50 % patient enrol receive standard preparative regimen . Thymoglobulin known suppress type cell cause transplant complication know `` chronic graft versus host disease ( cGVHD ) '' . The goal trial find add Thymoglobulin preparative regimen result decrease cGVHD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study non-blinded , randomize , multicentre trial test effect Thymoglobulin® vs. placebo primary outcome cGVHD . Subjects child adult unrelated donor transplant . Intervention : Infusion Thymoglobulin® three day prior transplant . Hypothesis : The hypothesis use Thymoglobulin® experimental group result absolute 20 % increase number patient free cGVHD 12 month , time peak incidence , 20 % control group 40 % experimental group . Outcome Measures : The Primary Outcome Measure freedom cGVHD 12 month transplantation , define withdrawal systemic immunosuppressive agent without resumption 12 month ( binary end-point , yes/no ) . Secondary outcome measure : Quality Life , overall incidence cGVHD ( include untreated case resolve case ) , incidence `` extensive '' cGVHD , time non-relapse mortality , time all-cause mortality , time relapse leukemia , graft rejection failure ( Yes vs. No ) , serious infection ( Yes vs. No ) , CMV activation ( Yes vs. No ) , organ-specific grading chronic graft versus host disease , resumption immunosuppressive agent 12 month ( Yes vs. No ) , dose immunosuppressive drug still require 12 month , incidence acute graft versus host disease .</detailed_description>
