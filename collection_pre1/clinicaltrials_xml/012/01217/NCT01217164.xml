	<brief_summary>Adequate nutrition important prevent malnutrition postnatal period thus optimize growth development child bear prematurely . To avoid malnutrition recommend provide nutrient necessary growth rate similar intrauterine life . For nearly one decade study minimize in-hospital malnutrition child bear prematurely , especially gestational age le 32 week birth weight 1,500 g , call newborn low birth weight ( VLBW ) . Embleton et al.demonstrated current nutritional recommendation ( protein 3.0 3.8 g / kg / day ) , VLBW malnutrition cause protein calorie cumulative deficit . Poor nutrition neonatal period impair growth neuromotor cognitive development hospital discharge . The investigator hypothesis VLBW subject aggressive nutrition protein-calorie high birth discharge , would present high weight gain VLBW infant receive routine diet service , without produce adverse effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study use newborn weight less equal 1,500 , University Hospital Pedro Ernesto ( HUPE ) State University Rio de Janeiro . Were define exclusion criterion congenital malformation , genetic syndrome death patient inclusion study . All child include study write consent responsible , receive aggressive parenteral nutrition immediately birth minimal enteral feeding first second day life . When volume enteral diet reach value equal great 100 ml / kg / day suspend intravenous hydration parenteral nutrition . The increase enteral nutrition conduct compliance gradual increase 20 ml / kg / day , accord acceptance VLBW.The clinical trial randomize two type calorie intake diet . Newborn expose group ( EG ) receive enteral diet 4.5 g / kg / day protein 160cal/Kg/dia , control group ( CG ) use usual diet caloric intake 3.5 4 g / kg / day protein 120-140 kcal / kg / day . The osmolality diet change , increase volume achieve desire protein-caloric . We use two type nutrition : 1 ) raw milk milk exclusively bedside VLBW ( without fortify additive ) ; 2 ) milk formula premature exclusive . The type feed consider exclusive breastfeed exclusive formula premature 80 % predominance one type food . The food offer initially orogastric catheter child reach maturity feed cup / suction . The assessment initiate enteral feeding reach volume exceed 100 ml / kg / day suspend concomitant intravenous infusion nutrition parenteral total ( NPT ) solution , complete discharge 43 week correct gestational age , case death shutdown project request responsible . The calculation caloric intake water daily , presume breast milk value 1.5 g protein 70 calorias/100 ml milk formula premature infant use list value 2.3 g protein 80 calorie per 100ml.The outcome measure assess child complete 43 week correct gestational age . The sample size calculation assume risk 5 % , 80 % power prevalence 50 % result 60 newborn . Statistical analysis measure average rate weight gestational age birth discharge , average correct age discharge , rate SGA VLBW ; daily weight gain total day hospitalization , real weight gain period day recovery birth weight hospital discharge . Was also calculate difference Z score hospital discharge birth weight , length head circumference . Statistical calculation perform : Ficher exact test / odds ratio ( OR ) categorical variable , ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test continuous variable . Was consider p &lt; 0.05 statistically significant .</detailed_description>
