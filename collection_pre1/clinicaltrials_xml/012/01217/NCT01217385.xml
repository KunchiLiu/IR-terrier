	<brief_title>Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging Monitoring Predicting Response Patients With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy Before Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether percentage change diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging ( DOSI ) measurement tumor/normal ( T/N ) tissue optical index ( TOI ) baseline mid-therapy predictive final pathologic response primary tumor patient locally advance breast cancer treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Secondary - To investigate whether change TOI measurement baseline post-therapy predictive final pathologic response patient treat regimen . - To investigate whether baseline TOI measurement associate final pathologic response patient treat regimen . - To investigate whether TOI measurement baseline , change baseline mid-therapy , change baseline post-therapy correlate available MRI volumetric image measurement . - To investigate whether change TOI measurement baseline mid-therapy , baseline post-therapy , correlate standard-of-care image and/or MRI-imaging measurement . - To explore whether additional optical endpoint index obtain DOSI measurement use predict final pathologic response patient treat regimen . - To determine cutpoint percent change TOI baseline mid-therapy predictive pathological complete response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging ( DOSI ) baseline , 5-10 day initiation neoadjuvant chemotherapy , early- mid-neoadjuvant therapy , within 21 day completion neoadjuvant therapy . Results compare standard-of-care imaging ( e.g. , MRI , ultrasound , mammography ) . Patients undergo surgery .</detailed_description>
