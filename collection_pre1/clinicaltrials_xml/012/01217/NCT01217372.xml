	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis relatively common disease . The prevalence general population may range 10 12 percent , 0.4 1 percent new case report every year accord different series . Without specific pharmacological therapy , recurrence rate patient establish diagnosis nephrolithiasis extremely high may range 15 20 percent per year , cumulative incidence five year range 27 50 percent . Although genetic factor play important role development nephrolithiasis , environmental factor diet also appear affect stone formation . Diet base restrict intake animal protein salt , combine normal calcium intake , may reduce risk stone formation . However , efficacy prevent stone recurrence limit , particular repeat stone former . Potassium citrate also effective prevent stone recurrence patient calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis . Low tolerability , however , may remarkably limit use medication . Citrus fruit natural rich source citrate diet supplementation juice citrus fruit may represent valuable alternative option supply citrate without expose patient adverse effect citrate contain medication . Among commonly consume citrus fruit , lemon contain great concentration citric acid ( 49,2 g/Kg ) , nearly 5 time concentration orange . A half cup pure lemon juice provide daily amount citrate comparable standard daily dose alkali citrate medication . The citrate supply juice escape metabolic degradation vivo excrete unchanged urine may prevent tendency calcium oxalate salt precipitate . Lemon juice supplementation may also additional advantage reduce urinary calcium excretion without affect oxalate excretion , orange juice affect urinary calcium may increase urinary oxalate . A study try evaluate effect lemon juice supplementation patient calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis , finding flaw retrospective , observational design study small sample size limited power statistical analysis reliability result . Thus , protective effect lemon juice supplementation recurrence stone patient calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis worth investigate adequately power design trial . AIM The study primarily aim evaluate whether lemon juice add standard diet recommendation compare diet recommendation alone may reduce risk new stone formation patient recurrent idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis . Secondarily , study evaluate effect lemon juice supplementation complication nephrolithiasis urinary tract infection , colic symptom , hospitalization stone disruption removal , well effect urinary factor ( urinary citrate , oxalate , calcium excretion pH ) may favor limit stone formation relationships effect risk stone recurrence . DESIGN According urinary citrate excretion baseline evaluation patient satisfy selection criterion stratify two stratum : Stratum 1 : Hypocitraturia ( urinary citrate excretion &gt; 320 mg/24 h ) Stratum 2 : Normocitraturia ( urinary citrate excretion &lt; 320 mg/24 h ) Within stratum , patient randomize 1:1 basis two-year treatment lemon juice supplement standard recommend diet standard diet alone . All patient hypocitraturic stratum also prescribe potassium citrate 2g twice daily . Due Prospective , Randomized , Open , Blind Endpoint ( PROBE ) design study , patient physicians charge patient care monitor aware patient treatment , Investigators involve data handle analysis blind patient treatment allocation . 101 patient per group include . Thus , total 202 patient randomize .</detailed_description>
