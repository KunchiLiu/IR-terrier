	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give temozolomide irinotecan hydrochloride together without bevacizumab work treat young patient recurrent refractory medulloblastoma central nervous system ( CNS ) primitive neuroectodermal tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide irinotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether temozolomide irinotecan hydrochloride effective without bevacizumab treat medulloblastoma CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Irinotecan Hydrochloride With Without Bevacizumab Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Refractory Medulloblastoma CNS Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. To compare overall survival ( OS ) subject receive combination temozolomide irinotecan subject receive temozolomide , irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) , bevacizumab recurrent medulloblastoma ( MB ) /primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) childhood . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate treatment arm amongst patient enrol measurable disease . II . To determine event-free survival ( EFS ) patient compare across regimen . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 1-5 . ARM II : Patients receive temozolomide PO irinotecan hydrochloride IV arm I bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
