	<brief_summary>Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC ) multi-system disease , usually present seizure , mental retardation autism , exhibit high variability clinical finding among within family . Investigators research order identify possible neurocognitive benefit treatment RAD001 placebo six month period . There may also potential improvement seizure frequency , sleep autistic behavior . We hope trial lead well understand TSC new form treatment , benefit child adult TSC future . Individuals diagnose TSC ask participate study age 6 21 year age IQ great equal 60 . Both male female ask participate . Additionally , eligible study participation , individual must seizure medication ( ) , applicable , least 6 month . Individuals must also able participate neuropsychological test meet certain medical criterion . They need sign inform consent . If enrol study , participant number screening test help determine eligible participation clinical trial . If eligible treatment phase trial , ask take either study drug placebo ( pill medicine ) , determine chance . The study involve 9 visit , 3 do locally , six month period , well follow-up call research nurse . Study visit vary length . Screening , three month six month visit may last 8 hour , visit le 2 hour . The study visit include blood draw , laboratory test neuropsychological assessment . There fee participate study . Some compensation may available travel cost out-of-state participant base fund availability . The study drug provide charge study . After study data analyze , family inform overall result . Treatment study may may improve child 's learning skill ( neurocognition ) . Future patient may benefit learn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This signal-seeking Phase II randomize , placebo-controlled trial RAD001 child young adult TSC neurocognition primary outcome autism spectrum disorder secondary outcome . Specific Aims /Objectives Primary objective - To evaluate efficacy RAD001 neurocognition patient TSC compare placebo measure well-validated , standardized , direct indirect neurocognitive tool . - To evaluate safety RAD001 compare placebo patient TSC focus NCI CTCAE Grade 3 4 adverse event , serious adverse event , Grade 3 4 laboratory toxicity . Secondary objective - Comparison absolute change baseline frequency epileptiform event record seizure diaries patient take RAD001 vs. placebo - Comparison sleep disturbance patient take RAD001 vs. placebo , measure Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire ( PSQ ) sleep logs - Comparison autism spectrum disorder feature patient take RAD001 vs. placebo , measure ADOS SRS - Comparison academic skill patient take RAD001 vs. placebo , measure WRAT4 - Comparison behavioral problem patient take RAD001 v placebo , measure behavioral rating scale ( BRIEF , BASC , SDQ , CHQ SRS )</detailed_description>
