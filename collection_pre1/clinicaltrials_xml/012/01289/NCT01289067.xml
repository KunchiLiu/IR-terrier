	<brief_summary>The purpose study test gene BRCAness ( BRCA [ BReast CAncer ] gene ) Studying gene could help predict patient would benefit treatment satraplatin , medication use subject fail prior chemotherapy . All subject biopsy metastatic lesion measure BRCAness ( gene signature ) . This gene signature may able predict response satraplatin tool develop able screen patient likely benefit satraplatin . Subjects receive Satraplatin day 1-5 Prednisone 5 mg twice daily every 35 day . Response rate evaluate every 2 cycle approximately every 9 week . Patients consider responder measurable disease meeting criterion partial complete response . PSA measure day one treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle 35 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utilizing A Genomic Sig `` BRCAness '' Eval Efficacy Satraplatin Men With Met . Castration Resistant Prostate Ca</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We develop genomic base signature `` BRCAness '' base literature genomic signature woman breast cancer germline BRCA mutations.The `` BRCAness '' breast cancer signature differentiate germline BRCA 1/2 breast cancer standard estrogen-receptor ( + ) breast cancer . We obtain library genomic signature Recently technique use develop transcriptional `` signature '' androgen receptor ( AR ) activity men CRPC ( Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer ) . The investigator apply `` BRCAness '' breast cancer signature pathological prostate cancer specimens determine percentage patient overall prostate cancer population express signature , well clinical histological phenotype population . This novel prostate cancer `` BRCAness '' signature develop period 4-6 month . This `` BRCAness '' signature previously evaluate prostate cancer patient would expect , base know characteristic BRCA mutant breast ovarian cancer , platinum-responsive . Relevant clinical data , include histology , grade , stage , size residual tumor , recurrence , survival , obtain outpatient inpatient chart perform subsequent correlative study . All patient enrol phase II clinical trial satraplatin pre-treatment biopsy metastatic site . All specimen freeze , batch store previously describe . We anticipate patient enrol 16 month trial open . When last patient enrol trial metastatic biopsy collect , ship bulk dry ice laboratory RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) isolation , RNA quality assessment processing , microarray hybridization , microarray data quality assessment , `` BRCAness '' prostate cancer signature application . Frozen biopsy process microarray analysis use laser capture microdissection RNA amplification use adaptation previously publish method . The application prostate cancer BRCAness signature take place two month .</detailed_description>
