	<brief_summary>The primary goal project examine short long-term effect intervention focus three interrelated dimension health : improving sleep , increase physical activity , improve skill emotion regulation . This intervention target high-risk youth key neuromaturational period—early adolescence—when many individual experience new challenge regulatory system involve sleep , activity , emotion regulation . This maturational period also crucial time normal development habit , skill , proclivity domain . Thus , early adolescence present unique opportunity intervention target three interrelated regulatory system . Participants include 200 9-13 year-old child sibling child enrol one three ongoing study vulnerability resilience , whose family initially identify basis sociodemographic , child , and/or family risk recruit thru local Family Centers . Children select difficulty least one domain ( sleep , sedentary behavior , emotion regulation ) randomly assign either control intervention group . All family receive baseline , one- two-year follow-up assessment child sleep , physical activity , emotion regulation . Families intervention group opportunity receive feedback intervention service three child domain parent family issue ( e.g. , parent involvement , parent self-care , school problem ) follow initial assessment one-year follow . The intervention involve parent target youth receive feedback child 's current status area family functioning . If desire , family also participate follow-up meeting parent and/or target youth improve youth 's sleep , physical activity , and/or emotion regulation skill , well aspects family environment . The investigator hypothesize intervention associate improvement sleep , physical activity , emotion regulation among intervention group , well improvement measure social , behavioral , affective function . Finally , investigator explore possibility increase parental involvement mediate change find child sleep , physical activity , emotion regulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective project examine short long-term effect intervention focus three interrelated dimension health : improving sleep , increase physical activity , improve skill emotion regulation . This intervention target high-risk youth key neuromaturational period—early adolescence—when many individual experience new challenge regulatory system involve sleep , activity , emotion regulation . SPECIFIC AIMS : 1 . To examine effect intervention sleep , physical activity , emotion regulation : Hypothesis 1a : The intervention result increase total sleep regularize sleep/wake schedule ( measure Sensewear sleep/activity monitor sleep log home environment ) . Hypothesis 1b : The intervention result increase physical activity less time per week sedentary activity ( measure Sensewear activity monitor standardize physical activity questionnaire ) . Hypothesis 1c : The intervention result improve emotion regulation ( measure composite index derive interaction task , well home school measure emotion regulation ) . 2 . To examine intervention effect externalize ( problem behavior ) , internalize symptom , peer relationship . Hypothesis 2a : The intervention result low level externalize internalizing symptom improve relationship peer measure parent , youth , teacher report . Hypothesis 2b : Intervention effect low level externalize internalizing symptom improve relationship peer , find , mediated improvement child sleep , physical activity , emotion regulation . SECONDARY AIMS : In addition specific aim follow exploratory analysis plan : 3 . To examine parent-child interaction mediator change child sleep , physical activity , emotion regulation . Just interested possibility change child problem behavior peer relationship mediate improvement sleep , physical activity , emotion regulation , examine aspect improvement sleep , physical activity , emotion regulation mediate improvement quality parent-child interaction ( e.g. , parental involvement ) , base parent report observation parent-child quality . 4 . To explore directional effect sleep , daytime activity , daytime mood , emotion regulation , affective behavioral symptom . For example , examine : ) sleep difficulty predict daytime measure negative mood , irritability , decreased physical activity follow day ; b ) daytime measure stress negative affect predict sleep difficulty subsequent night ; c ) physical activity day associate well sleep night . 5 . To examine impact intervention measure physical health ( e.g. , Body Mass Index waist circumference ) academic function ( e.g. , day school missed/tardiness school performance ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility study base multiple criterion , include family 's low SES status ( i.e. , income le 50 % poverty line 2 year college education parent ) Risk status child problem sleep , physical activity , and/or affect regulation . Criteria latter establish use 14item screening procedure administer parent . Children parent severe mental health concern prohibit complete assessment protocol potentially benefit intervention eligible participation ( e.g. , parent child severe mental retardation , autism , schizophrenia , psychotic disorder ) . If child previous diagnosis obstructive sleep apnea , still benefit participate study exclude . Adolescents currently incarcerate court mandate facility exclude enrol study . If adolescent becomes incarcerate placed court mandate facility enrollment study , he/she withdrawn study duration incarceration court mandate placement longer amount time remain study participation . However , adolescent transiently incarcerate ( example adolescent detain week juvenile detention facility ) may resume research activity he/she longer incarcerate court mandate facility time remain study participation lapse . No study procedures activity conduct participant he/she incarcerate court mandate facility .</criteria>
