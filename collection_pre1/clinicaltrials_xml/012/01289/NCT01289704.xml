	<brief_summary>Charcot−Marie−Tooth neuropathy type 1A ( CMT1A ) one common inherit neurological disorder . The study evaluate efficacy safety innovative rehabilitation protocol constitute exercise treadmill stretch proprioceptive approach . A total 92 patient enrol study treat control , randomize , single blind , way . To recruit high number patient CMT1A study multicentric comprehend four active clinical center field CMT , Italy . People CMT1A motivate enter rehabilitation protocol date effective therapy disease . Therefore , investigator expect high compliance patient . With present project investigator plan clarify several unanswered question : 1 ) efficacy safety treadmill conventional protocol ; 2 ) duration frequency rehabilitation treatment ; 3 ) sensitive outcome measure evaluate efficacy rehabilitation approach patient CMT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A multicentre , prospective , randomise , control , single blind study evaluate impact aerobic exercise , base tightly control program treadmill , rehabilitation therapy CMT 1A neuropathy . Comparing aerobic training treadmill combine respiratory physiotherapy , stretch proprioceptive exercise ( TreSPE- treat group ) conventional treatment compose respiratory physiotherapy , stretch proprioceptive exercise ( SPE- control group ) provide information impact Treadmill CMT1A . 92 patient ( 23 per centre ) enrol randomly assign TreSPE ( n = 46 ) SPE ( n = 46 ) . Both group treat three month follow six month . No serious side effect expect TreSPE , also suggest preliminary result . For safety reason blood pressure ( BP ) , heart rate ( HR ) electrocardiogram record rehabilitation treatment treat physician considers necessary . The patient allow , need , hold parallel bar treadmill exercise . According American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) guideline cardiopulmonary exercise test interrupt BP raise 240/120 and/or HR 220−patients age .</detailed_description>
