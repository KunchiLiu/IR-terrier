	<brief_summary>PURPOSE : Cetuximab platinum 5FU standard combination first-line treatment patient metastatic recurrent Head Neck squamous cell carcinoma . Cetuximab taxane combination demonstrate promising activity Head Neck cancer . This phase II trial study new cetuximab , docetaxel cisplatin combination name TPEx first-line treatment setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With Cetuximab Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine efficacy TPEx combination patient head neck cancer term objective response rate ( RECIST , see statistical consideration ) Secondary - To assess toxicity TPEx combination - Determine efficacy TPEx combination patient head neck cancer : Best Overall Response , progression-free survival survival . - Translational research objective : To good understand mechanisms chemoresistance identify biomarkers analysis tumor biopsy ( RNA , gene expression profile ) protein profile ( plasma sample ) . Exploratory analysis . OUTLINE : This open-label phase II , multicenter study . Patients receive four cycle chemotherapy comprise cetuximab IV plus docetaxel IV 1 hour cisplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion fourth cycle chemotherapy , patient receive maintenance therapy cetuximab every 2 week . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity accord patient investigator . Tumor check-up perform every 6 week . This study allow translational research blood sample biopsy baseline treatment , treatment TPEx combination ( week 6 ) . , After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
