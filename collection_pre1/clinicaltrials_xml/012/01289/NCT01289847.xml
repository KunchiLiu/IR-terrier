	<criteria>The subject age equal 2 16 year age , either sex , belong ethnic group , minimum weight 10 kg . This weight base amount blood require testing . The subject primary immunodeficiency disease , significant component hypogammaglobulinemia and/or antibody deficiency ( e.g . common variable immunodeficiency , Xlinked autosomal form agammaglobulinemia , hyperIgM syndrome , WiskottAldrich Syndrome ) . NB Isolated deficiency single IgG subclass , specific antibody without hypogammaglobulinemia per se , qualify inclusion . Subjects already receive IGIV replacement therapy require follow first infusion Gammaplex : Documented IGIV dose ( ) treatment interval last 2 consecutive routine IGIV treatment ( one screen visit result ) . The previous dos also meet follow condition study entry : Have change ± 50 % mean dose least 3 month ; 300 800 mg/kg/infusion ; give every 2128 day , inclusive ; license investigational product ( Phase III IIIb ) . Documented previous IgG trough level last 2 consecutive routine IGIV treatment last 2 consecutive routine IGIV treatment : Maintained least 300 mg/dL baseline serum IgG level ( define initiation gamma globulin treatment subject ) ; must than/equal 600 mg/dL . If subject female childbearing potential , must negative result HCGbased pregnancy test . If subject female become sexually active , must practice contraception use method proven reliability duration study . The subject willing comply aspect protocol , include blood sampling , duration study .
