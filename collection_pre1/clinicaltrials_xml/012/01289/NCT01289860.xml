	<brief_summary>This study control , cross-over , acute flavonoid intervention trial young old adult . Subjects consume blueberry beverage one visit control beverage another . Cognitive function pre drink assess , blood urine sample take well blood pressure measure vascular reactivity . These outcome measure take 2 5 hour post drink . It predict flavonoid blueberry drink would lead improved performance cognitive test vascular reactivity measure compare follow control drink . It think could due increase vaso-dilation improve blood flow brain investigated extension project sample individual underwent brain image MRI scanner pre post blueberry control drink .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The control drink match blueberry drink bioactive compound may affect cognition , specifically sugar vitamin C. Volunteers healthy , medication , without high blood pressure , high cholesterol , high BMI , diabetes medical condition . Older adult age 61-75 year young adults 18-26 year . Blood urine sample analyse flavonoid level Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor , biomarker memory learning , flavonoid may lead increase BDNF production ERK-CREB-BDNF pathway . Flavonoids may also increase nitric oxide production improve flexibility blood vessel hence measure vascular reactivity use Digital Volume Pulse machine . This lead increase vaso-dilation blood flow brain , therefore fMRI study carry investigate use arterial spin label follow acute blueberry supplementation compare control drink .</detailed_description>
