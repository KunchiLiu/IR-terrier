	<criteria>1 . Indolent Bcell lymphoma : grade 13a follicular , small lymphocytic , lymphoplasmacytic , marginal zone lymphoma ; stage IIIIV , bulky disease stage II ( i.e . single mass &gt; 5 cm direction ) define accord WHO Classification , 2008 2 . CT image screen phase ( base local evaluation ) show 2 clearly demarcated lesion large diameter ≥ 1.5 cm , 1 clearly demarcate lesion large diameter ≥ 2.0 cm . CT image perform screen consider baseline image 3 . Indolent Bcell NHL remain stable unresponsive within 6 month treatment rituximab rituximabcontaining regimen : Maintaining stable disease failure achieve PR rituximabbased therapy . ( CT image support finding , perform least 30 day last dose rituximabbased therapy ) , Disease progression rituximabbased therapy ( e.g. , include 4 weekly course rituximab give 6 week interval ) , Disease progression subject stable disease well response rituximabbased therapy &lt; 6 month last dose rituximab Note : Subjects must receive least 4 infusion rituximab ( either monotherapy combination chemotherapy ) . 4 . Screening laboratory value : Platelets ≥ 75,000/µL ( 7 x 109 cells/L ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000/µL ( 1.0 x 109 cells/L ) ALT , AST alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 ULN total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 xULN ( isolate predominantly indirect hyperbilirubinaemia due Gilbert 's syndrome acceptable inclusion ) 5 . ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 6 . Age ≥ 18 year 7 . Life expectancy least 3 month 8 . Signed write informed consent prior perform studyspecific procedure Main exclusion criterion : 1 . Grade 3b follicular lymphoma evidence indolent lymphoma transform aggressive lymphoma verify biopsy confirmation [ e.g . constitutional symptom , poor performance status , fast grow tumour increase lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) level ] 2 . Previous allogeneic stem cell transplant 3 . Previous external beam radiation therapy pelvis . Previous external beam radiation therapy bony disease cranium , mediastinum , axilla 3 vertebral body 4 . More 10 mg prednisolone daily time randomisation 5 . Prior bendamustine treatment within 1 year randomisation result CR PR least 6 month 6 . Known CNS involvement indolent lymphoma 7 . Other past current malignancy . Subjects free malignancy least 5 year , history definitively treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , successfully treat situ carcinoma , eligible 8 . Chronic current active infectious disease require systemic antibiotic , antifungal , antiviral treatment , limited , chronic renal infection , chronic chest infection bronchiectasis , tuberculosis active Hepatitis C 9 . Clinically significant cardiac disease include unstable angina , acute myocardial infarction within 6 month screen , congestive heart failure , arrhythmia require therapy , exception extrasystole minor conduction abnormality . Subjects well control congestive heart failure atrial arrhythmia need exclude discussed study Medical Monitor 10 . Significant concurrent , uncontrolled medical condition include , limited , renal , hepatic , haematological , gastrointestinal , endocrine , pulmonary , neurological , cerebral psychiatric disease 11 . History significant cerebrovascular disease event significant symptom sequelae 12 . Current active liver biliary disease ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) 13 . Jaundice 14 . Known HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C positive 15 . Creatinine clearance ≤ 10 mL/min ( measure estimate use Cockcroft Gault equation ) 16 . Treatment known nonmarketed drug substance experimental therapy within 5terminal halflives 4 week prior screen , whichever longer currently participate interventional clinical study unless sole purpose study collection survival data 17 . Known suspected inability comply study protocol 18 . Lactating woman , woman positive pregnancy test screen woman ( childbearing potential ) well men partner childbearing potential , willing use adequate contraception study start last treatment dose 6 month follow cessation treatment . Female contraception must individually recommend expert . Adequate contraception define abstinence , oral contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone , injectable progestogen , implant levonorgestrel , estrogenic vaginal ring , percutaneous contraceptive patch , intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) , male partner sterilization ( vasectomy documentation azoospermia ) prior female subject 's entry study , male sole partner subject , double barrier method : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) vaginal spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) . 20.Major surgery less 30 day prior start treatment . 21.Known hypersensitivity active substance excipients control appropriate premedication</criteria>
