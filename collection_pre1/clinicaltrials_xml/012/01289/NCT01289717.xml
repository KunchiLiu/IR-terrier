	<brief_summary>There need develop blood and/or urine test help detect early sign rejection people kidney transplant . Researchers examine blood , urine , tissue sample try identify genetic marker certain condition like rejection , response therapy , scar kidney . By study gene pattern , researcher hope able diagnose condition earlier improve kidney survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation good treatment option people kidney disease . However , still much learn best care transplant kidney keep work long time . One field interest one 's cellular make-up might affect body 's immune response ( body 's natural defense system illness foreign thing ) kidney transplant . Cellular test , like gene expression , help doctor study person 's cellular trait . Gene expression information find one 's DNA translate RNA eventually proteins . These component present body 's cell . In study , researcher try learn certain change RNA proteins find blood , urine , transplant biopsy tissue detect rejection injury occur become severe . The blood urine test look pattern one 's DNA ( call genetic marker ) . This study follow subject 2 year transplant . There total 12 study visit additional study visit rejection occur . The study require additional sample blood , urine , tissue collect routine clinical visit biopsy ( procedure remove examine small piece kidney tissue ) .</detailed_description>
