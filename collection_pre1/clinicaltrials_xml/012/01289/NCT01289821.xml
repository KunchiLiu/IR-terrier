	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy ( effectiveness ) safety regorafenib give combination chemotherapy mFOLFOX6 first line therapy patient metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . mFOLFOX6 approve chemotherapy . Regorafenib oral ( i.e . take mouth ) multi-targeted kinase inhibitor . A kinase inhibitor target certain key protein essential survival cancer cell . By specifically target protein , regorafenib may stop cancer growth . The growth tumor may decrease prevent specific protein function . The primary endpoint ( meaningful result track ) study base rate response , i.e . disease get small . The aim show therapy colorectal cancer mFOLFOX6 combination regorafenib improve response rate observe standard therapy .</brief_summary>
