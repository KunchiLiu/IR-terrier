	<brief_summary>The investigator interest learning change find condition call `` Combined elevation Malonic MethylMalonic Acid , CMAMMA. `` Malonic , MA MethylMalonic , MMA , acid form breakdown protein normal condition . However , condition call CMAMMA increase acid blood urine , normal . Some people high MA MMA blood urine serious disease , start baby young child include heart disease problem learn . These people change special enzyme call Malonyl CoA Decarboxylase ( MCD ) . Other people high level MA MMA obvious illness . The investigator sure high level MA MMA sick . The goal study learn people high level MA MMA make sure medical problem result high level . The investigator also want find gene enzyme cause high level MA MMA .</brief_summary>
