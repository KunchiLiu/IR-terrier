	<brief_title>Sorafenib Plus Capecitabine Efficacy Assessment Patients With Advanced Pre-treated Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment dos : Sorafenib 200mg morning,400mg evening ; escalation 400mg twice daily 1 cycle Capecitabine 850mg/m2 twice daily Oral Days 1-14 , week 1-2 Fluoro-Deoxy Glucose Positron Emitting Tomography ( FDG-PET ) image baseline 17-21 day therapy . Sample size justification/statistical analysis Sample size estimate order able test null hypothesis overall survival rate 6 month less 30 % . This hypothesis test use binomial distribution . The study able reject null hypothesis , use 1-sided test α = 0.025 , power 90 % case true overall survival ≥ 50 % ( rate 6 month ) . The sample size require 66 eligible patient ( follow 6 month minimum ) . Analysis do register patient use ITT approach eligible patient . A co-primary endpoint compare overall survival patient assess early PET responder patient assess early PET non responder ( clinician remain blinded PET response assessment ) . For primary analysis , patient undergo second PET assessment eligible time zero measure survival date second PET examination . It anticipate 95 % patient eligible analysis 50 % expect rate early PET non-responders ( result obtain unpublished study conduct Jules-Bordet Institute ) . With 66 patient register , anticipate 63 patient available co-primary endpoint . With 63 patient assumption HR comparison survival distribution around 0.385 ( base previously mention unpublished study ) , need use two-sided logrank test 2.5 % level ( 2.5 % choose existence 2 co-primary endpoint ) , 54 event ( power 90 % ) . With 63 patient follow-up accrual 1 year , reach number 54 event . However , account another possible 5 % drop-out ( patient 's refusal undergoing second PET examination instance ) , sample size increase 70 eligible patient . However , estimation 50 % expect rate early PET responder come prospective unicentric cohort 38 patient undergoing chemotherapy 1st line 2nd line treatment advance colorectal cancer receive biological agent together chemotherapy . Our estimation may reliable due small sample size different patient population . If rate early PET responder prove high , prepared increase sample size target power 90 % . For instance , rate 67 % instead 50 % , require number event would 62 in-stead 54 . If rate 75 % , number event increase 73 . The number patient would adapt accord rate evaluable patient PET objective rate patient lose follow-up . For reassess required number event , change hypothesis detecting , true , hazard ratio 0.385 favor early PET responder . We plan , course accrual , assess rate patient evaluable PET objective , early PET responder , possible rate patient lose follow-up order check whether need review plan sample size . However , interim analysis do primary endpoint . Secondary endpoint estimate progression-free survival objective response rate , describe adverse reaction associate study regimen study population . Also , determine correlation early metabolic response , assess FDG-PET/CT immediately first second cycle treatment study regimen , overall survival , progression-free survival , response rate , determine correlation growth modulation index ( GMI ) , define time progression study regimen time progression late regimen administer patient , overall survival progression-free survival . The study design single-arm phase II study , patient accrue one stage . No early stopping rule use .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm colorectal cancer metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . All standard chemotherapy agent ( fluoropyrimidines , irinotecan , oxaliplatin ) monoclonal antibody ( bevacizumab , cetuximab , panitumumab ) allow administer therapy study entry .

Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Participants may receive experimental agent . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition sorafenib capecitabine . Bleeding diathesis , history cardiovascular ischemic disease cerebrovascular incident within last six month , major surgery within four week . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study sorafenib capecitabine antitumor agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect .
