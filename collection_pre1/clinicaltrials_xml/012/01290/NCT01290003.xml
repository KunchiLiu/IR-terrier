	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate role antibiotic prevent infection baby bear meconium stain amniotic fluid . Normally baby pass meconium utero . In response hypoxic stress baby may pass meconium birth likely candidate problem related meconium passage inhalation . It believe baby prone infection meconium enhance bacterial growth may predispose baby secondary bacterial infection . In addition , meconium passage incriminate pointer in-utero infection . Whether use antibiotic baby bear meconium stain amniotic fluid reduce infectious episode complication thereof clear . Moreover , much publish literature prove refute . Most clinician low threshold use antibiotic baby . In view uncertainty regard antibiotic usage baby , investigator decide investigate role prophylactic antibiotic prevention neonatal sepsis baby bear meconium stain amniotic fluid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Antibiotics Preventing Infection Babies Born Through Meconium Stained Liquor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meconium passage newborn infant developmentally program event normally occur within first 24-48 hour birth . Intra uterine meconium passage near term term fetus associate feto-maternal stress factor and/or infection , whereas meconium passage post term pregnancy attribute gastro-intestinal maturity . The meconium stain amniotic fluid occur 12 % live birth per annuum . Aspiration meconium occur intra uterine life delivery first breath may result contribute respiratory pathology know meconium aspiration syndrome ( MAS ) represent leading cause perinatal morbidity , occur 5-20 % baby bear MSAF . The routine use antibiotic MSAF baby advocate long time part conventional treatment . Meconium passage utero hypothesize represent response fetal bacterial infection addition intrauterine hypoxia . Additionally rationale use antibiotic include radiographic similarity MAS bacterial pneumonia , vitro enhancement bacterial growth presence meconium well possibility meconium induced inhibition phagocytic activity respiratory burst response alveolar macrophage render patient MAS susceptible infection . These recommendation however empirical incidence bacterial infection neonate bear MSAF well MAS systematically evaluate , date . With rise concern emergence resistant strain neonatal ICUs possible side effect antibiotic ( like amino glycoside ) include nephrotoxicity ototoxicity neonate , systematically conduct , randomize control trial necessary ass utility antibiotic routine management infant MSAF MAS . Hence purpose prospective randomize control trial compare clinical course , complication , infection relate outcome case MSAF MAS , treat without antibiotic therapy</detailed_description>
