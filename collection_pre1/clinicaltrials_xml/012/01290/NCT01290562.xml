	<brief_summary>Patients new recurrent spine metastasis currently treat low dos radiation deliver ten treatment ( wide-field radiation therapy ) . Stererotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) technique high dos radiation target precisely metastasis treat administer small number session , thus reduce radiation damage surround tissue area spine . The purpose study evaluate efficacy spine SBRT alternative conventional radiation patient prior radiation , prior radiation , post-operative patient</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spine SBRT currently practice alternative conventional wide-field radiation up-front management spinal metastasis , re-irradiation scenario , post-operative setting . This study propose treat patient uniform spine SBRT approach , collect prospective outcome data basis future randomize trial design . Preliminary evaluation technique yield acceptable accuracy treatment delivery compare literature , practice follow current standard major university hospital perform technique . Furthermore , preliminary data also suggest efficacy safety patient treat SBRT spinal metastasis previously radiate field . However , well define prospective outcome lack patient group . There 3 cohort study target accrual 30 patient . Cohort 1 : patient spinal metastasis prior radiation . Cohort 2 : patient spinal metastasis history previous radiation affect spinal segment . Cohort 3 : post-operative patient spinal metastasis without history previous radiation affect spinal segment . All patient treat either 20-24 Gy one fraction ( recommend ) 20-24 Gy two fraction , 20-24 Gy three fraction . There also optional image component study . The purpose study determine efficacy spine SBRT select group patient use image base symptom base local control criterion</detailed_description>
