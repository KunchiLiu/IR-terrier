	<brief_title>Exploratory Lapatinib ( Positron Emission Tomography ) PET Study Subjects With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lapatinib anti-cancer drug take mouth inhibits HER2 protein , overexpressed breast tumour . It know whether lapatinib pass blood-brain barrier , , therefore , whether target secondary tumour brain . This study investigate whether lapatinib indeed enter brain . Subjects HER2-overexpressing breast cancer , without brain metastasis , receive lapatinib tablet daily 8 day . The subject also receive lapatinib small amount radioactivity attach first last day dose investigate whether take brain , use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan .</detailed_description>
