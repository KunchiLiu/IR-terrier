	<detailed_description>The initial application off-pump coronary artery bypass early ninety mainly direct highly select relatively low risk surgical patient . Since grow body evidence suggest many potential advantage OPCAB technique conventional cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) technique different group high-risk patient . On-off study multicentre , prospective , randomize , parallel , trial.Patients indicate elective urgent isolate coronary artery bypass graft additive European System Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation ≥ 6 enrol . Patients cardiogenic shock exclude . Patients randomly assign either coronary artery bypass surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( ON arm ) off-pump coronary artery bypass graft ( OFF arm ) . The composite primary end point include operative mortality , myocardial infarction , stroke , renal failure , re-operation bleeding adult respiratory distress syndrome , within 30 day surgery . The total planned sample size 693 patient ; actual number enrol patient 411 , accord result interim analysis schedule 400 enrollment ( alfa-spending=0.029 , Pocock method ) .</detailed_description>
