	<detailed_description>Glaucoma progressive optic neuropathy lead cause blindness United States1 second lead cause blindness worldwide . In glaucoma , vision lose apoptosis retinal ganglion cell . Diagnosis glaucoma usually base combination progressive , characteristic vision loss ( measure use visual field test ) progressive optic nerve head damage ( detect dilate fundus examination optic disc photography ) . While ocular hypertension ( OHT ) sufficient diagnosis glaucoma , great prognostic modifiable factor . In fact , effective treatment glaucoma currently treat elevate IOP . This treatment provide cure slow glaucoma progression . IOP determine balance aqueous production ( flow ) aqueous humor outflow either trabecular meshwork uveoscleral pathway . Therefore , clinically available glaucoma treatment design increase drainage and/or reduce production . The main purpose current study determination aqueous humor dynamic . There two main type glaucoma , `` open angle '' chronic glaucoma `` close angle '' acute glaucoma . Open angle glaucoma tend progress slowly may remain undetected patient notice change vision . On hand , angle closure glaucoma appear suddenly painful , therefore often diagnosed quickly . The chance suffer either one type glaucoma depend greatly one 's ethnic background . People suffer primary angle-closure glaucoma ( PACG ) short axial length shallow anterior chamber . These physical dimension find predominantly people Asia India . Angle-closure glaucoma cause factor either pull push iris angle , physically block drainage aqueous humor increase resistance outflow . The IOP increase dangerous level order drain fluid obstruct outflow pathway . Narrow angle present child . As person age , lens eye continue grow . In people , growth push iris forward , narrow angle . Risk factor develop narrow angle include Asian ethnicity , hyperopia , family history , advanced age . Prevalence figure identify East Asia home majority affect PACG . PACG acknowledge major cause ocular morbidity Chinese population common among Chinese people among Caucasian people . Part global project travel China study Chinese child adult . This do collaboration Ganzu Hospital Lanzhou , China . This part current protocol . Open angle glaucoma typically occur old patient sixth decade life . African-Americans six time high risk develop condition general population especially family history glaucoma . Additionally , patient highly myopic , diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular problem high risk develop open angle glaucoma . Visual acuity , axial length medical history collect part current protocol . Unlike narrow angle glaucoma , patient open angle glaucoma gradual blockage aqueous humor outflow despite seemingly open chamber angle drainage pathway . As eye age , drainage system become clogged debris causing pressure inside eye build harmful level . Open angle glaucoma develop gradually remain undetected year . Because usually pain experienced month year development symptom apparent , patient often unaware existence serious eye disorder . Since African-Americans high risk contract glaucoma , child adults ethnic background include study . Glaucoma occur child well adult . Glaucoma begin child 3 year old call infantile congenital glaucoma . Glaucoma manifest child 's teen juvenile glaucoma . There many cause childhood glaucoma , heredity , injury certain eye disorder . Once investigator collect information aqueous humor dynamic healthy teenaged child , investigator study child age glaucoma . The investigator plan conduct study Paracelsus University Salzburg Austria . That part present protocol . In recent rabbit study , investigator learn distinctive circadian rhythm IOP aqueous humor dynamic juvenile adult rabbit . In ongoing clinical study ocular hypertensive patient , investigator find glaucoma medication effective night despite efficacious day . This significant clinical importance . The investigator include study aqueous humor dynamic night current protocol determine normal circadian pattern ethnic group age group . In animal study , investigator find several significant difference aqueous humor dynamic immature animal compare adult animal . This continuum change occur young old adult . The investigator predict important change also take place ocular fluid dynamic eye child matures . The major change may occur puberty . Understanding normal ocular physiology child help u understand pathological change take place juvenile glaucoma . The clinical importance project immense</detailed_description>
