	<brief_summary>Major orthopaedic surgery painful require safe effective postoperative analgesic therapy . The successful use continuous peripheral nerve block provide sustained analgesia minimize need opioid analgesic throughout postoperative period avoid side effect associate central neuraxial technique . Excellent analgesia maintain opioid-related side effect avoid allow improve rehabilitation . However use exist method failure rate &gt; 20 % significantly limit analgesic benefit substantial proportion lead uncontrolled pain side effect opioid analgesic . A major concern use continuous peripheral nerve block difficulty placement catheter close enough nerve allow effective local anaesthetic spread therefore analgesia . The benefit ultrasound precisely place needle adjacent nerve increase efficacy block success undisputed . However ultrasound less help accurately place catheter . Indeed final position catheter tip predictable inadequate 10 % -50 % case . The explanation material currently use catheter stiff design avoid kink . Unfortunately stiffness often lead inadequate placement catheter tip . We develop catheter coil soon advance beyond needle tip , thus allow catheter tip remain close initial needle tip position therefore nerve . The aim prospective randomize double blind control study determine effectiveness new catheter comparison standard care method continuous femoral nerve block commonly use total knee arthroplasty . The primary outcome measure incidence catheter relate block failure 24 hour surgery . Our hypothesis coil catheter significantly improve efficacy continuous femoral nerve block compare exist technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims study The aim determine effectiveness coil catheter continuous peripheral nerve block total knee arthroplasty base secondary block failure compare secondary block failure conventional , currently use stimulate catheter . Study design The trial prospective single-centre randomize double-blinded controlled trial . Patients randomize ( 1 ) use conventional stimulating catheter ( 2 ) use coil catheter . Patient population Adult patient least 18 year age undergoing unilateral knee arthroplasty , spinal anaesthesia recruit randomized double blind control trial . Inclusion criterion : Ability provide inform consent , understand possible local anaesthetic-related complication , understand study protocol . Exclusion criterion : Any contraindication peripheral nerve block , allergy local anaesthetic , infection near insertion site , ASA classification IV V , pregnancy , chronic opioid analgesic therapy ( &gt; 30mg morphine equivalent per day ) , coagulopathy , know hepatic renal insufficiency , peripheral neuropathy patient refusal .</detailed_description>
