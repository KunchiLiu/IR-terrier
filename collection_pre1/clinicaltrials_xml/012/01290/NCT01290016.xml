	<brief_summary>Children overweight obese develop many health complication include diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol break bone often child healthy body weight . Recent short-term study child suggest increase milk intake 16 week begin improve body composition also reduce risk develop diabetes . However , study long enough truly test benefit high milk consumption condition include bone . Both dietary activity approach reduce obesity child suggest health professional combine call lifestyle intervention . Therefore , McGill University design 1-year intervention study focus lifestyle improvement reduce obesity child 6 12 year age . A control group monitor year , two group receive lifestyle intervention standard recommend ( 2 serving day ) high ( 4 serving day ) intakes milk . The intervention include 6 planning session increase intake vegetable , fruit milk along activity less time watch television use computerized game . Children muscle fat measure use x-ray device also measure bone beginning , middle end study . They also small blood sample take every 3 month measure blood sugar , cholesterol nutrient . Changes study demonstrate benefit lifestyle milk intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Childhood obesity increasingly major health care problem Canada . Not approximately 30 % Canadian child overweight/obese , develop significant sequela include insulin resistance , hyperinsulinemia , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , diabetes mellitus . Additionally obese child low bone mass , low 25 ( OH ) D concentration fracture frequently . Canadian child average meet recommend intake vegetable fruit half &lt; 8 year old meet recommend intake milk . Obese child likely inactive spend screen-time free time . There promise childhood evidence diet 3 4 serving milk support healthy body composition ( lean mass height ) improve insulin sensitivity short term bone mass long term . Family base intervention effective weight reduction child . To date , combine assessment benefit improve intake milk plus active lifestyle obese child body composition , bone blood biochemistry family intervention lacking . Objectives Hypotheses : 1 . To determine 1-year lifestyle intervention planning session design improve diet activity within context family environment reduce adiposity elevate lean mass support bone mass obese child compare control group augment intake milk 4 daily serving result superior change . The primary outcome change body mass index ( BMI ) Z-score along waist circumference assessment adiposity ; select ease use large study clinic body composition assessment feasible . Hypothesis : lifestyle intervention yield modest change adiposity lean mass accompany reduction bone mass , augment milk intervention yield superior reduction adiposity elevation lean bone mass height growth . It hypothesize bone mass low maintenance bone mass standard intervention thereby judge inadequate . 2 . To explain hypothesized benefit intervention lean , adipose bone mass measure indicator glucose metabolism , satiety relate gut hormone along novel biomarkers skeletal metabolism include osteocalcin , adiponectin vitamin D. Hypothesis : high milk intake associate low glucose , insulin , ghrelin 1,25 ( OH ) 2D accompany high 25 ( OH ) D , osteocalcin , peptide YY glucagon-like peptide 1 . 3 . Test intervention high milk serving link change child eat behavior satiety use Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire reflect eat child 's normal environment . Hypothesis : child randomize high milk intervention group demonstrate improve score satiety responsiveness component survey . METHODS - Randomized Controlled Trial Ethics : This study approve McGill University Institutional Review Board Faculty Medicine October 2010 also conduct compliance Tri-Council Policy Statement 2005 compliance local regulation law govern research involve human subject . Otherwise healthy obese child ( 6 12 year age ) recruit follow informed consent . Upon completion , control group offer counseling ( 5 visit ) intervention adjust age ( i.e . counsel + basic anthropometric measurement ) . Population Recruitment : Obese child ( n=150 ) West-Island Montreal surround island area within 50 km Macdonald Campus McGill University . Our approach recruitment use mailing Canada Post . This service excellent result particular area ( predominantly West Island Montreal island area towards Ottawa ) household receive brochure study invite attend child body mass index ( BMI ) range . A graph provide guide parent invite call u information . Obesity define basis body mass index &gt; 95th percentile age accord World Health Organization . In total 150 child 6 12 year age recruit 6-month window . Those meeting entrance criterion randomize 3 group : 1. control group information ( counsel 12 month 6-8 year old 6 month 9-12 year old ) ; 2. lifestyle intervention ( planning/counseling improve diet activity ) ( 6-8 year old ) ; 3. lifestyle intervention augment total 4 serving milk/milk product daily ( 6-12 year old ) . Study Protocol : Participants screen entrance criterion visit 2 week prior begin 1-year program . Upon confirmation meeting inclusion criterion , family telephone confirm participation 6-8 year old randomize 3 group stratify sex 9-12 year old randomize 2 group stratify sex . They ( parent &amp; child ) ask complete 3-day diary food week prior baseline visit visit complete questionnaire ( activity , eat behavior , demographic etc. ) . These used baseline measure group lifestyle intervention group guide intervention regard food choice activity preference . At baseline visit , blood sampling , dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) anthropometric measurement complete . All group receive simple education baseline visit regard Canada 's Food Guide Canada 's Activity Guide give 3-day diary document food . A registered dietitian go content explain use guide food-diary . Then group see 3 , 6 , 9 12 month study obtain new diary , perform anthropometric measurement blood biochemistry . Surveys ( activity , satiety ) take visit . Body composition bone mass measure baseline , 6 12 month . The intervention group lifestyle counsel visit end month 1 5 enable individualize family-child counseling ( intensive phase ) follow every 3 month ( establish phase 9 month plus receive debrief 12 month study coordinator ) . Intervention family receive monthly telephone call outstanding issue reinforce lifestyle change . Details Family-Child counsel end month 1 5 plus 9 mo ( 1.5 h visit ) : Intervention group planning/counseling session total 9 hour base 5 x 1.5 h visit end month 1 5 . An additional visit 9 mo ( 1.5 h ) use determine new diet activity intervention strategy necessary time child grows/matures due season . Counseling visit end month 2 , 5 9 overlap regular study visit conduct study data collect limit lead bias ( day need limit travel ) . All intervention plan visit register dietitian . Both intervention group instruct detail use Canada 's Food Guide Activity Guide ( include reduce screen time ) ask set goal family-based behavioral intervention model Epstein ; consider environmental developmental framework arrive suitable planning family/near environment plus suitable child 's developmental age . The model Epstein ground social learn theory view choice , plan reinforcement , adapt children/families resource environment reinforcement positive behavior . Children family need change together whole also support child able make decision away home . This applied intervention improve asthma control child away home . Canada 's food guide serving Milk Alternatives ( include example 250 ml fluid milk , 250 ml soy beverage , 175 g yogurt , 175 kefir , 50 g cheese ) 2 per day child 4 8 year age serving vegetables fruit 5 per day . The augmented intervention group instruct consume 4 serving milk milk product daily ( include example 250 ml fluid milk , 175 g yogurt , 50 g cheese ) . The 4 serving milk aligns recommend serving 9 14 year old child ; age end study soon thereafter . This intervention approach ethical forward-looking . It would unethical counsel child parent achieve recommend 2 serving milk alternative product 8 year old . Upon completion study investigator survey family regard sustainability intake 4 serving day - child turn 9 year old recommendation . The intervention group also counsel food group result healthy diet overall . Meal plan visit intervention use Canada 's Food Guide include age appropriate serving size , approach combine food enhance satiety , incorporate snack fun food , cook method , hidden energy , specifically increase vegetable , fruit milk intake family . The example serving list previously . Within family food preference availability use counsel towards achieve 2 4 serving milk milk product day . Similar family-based dietary intervention successfully use overweight obese child 6 year age high . The intervention group also actively plan increase activity accord Activity Guide include increase activity 90 minute daily decrease non-active time 90 minute 5 month ( hence visit end month 1 5 ) . The new My Food Guide on-line Health Canada offer convenient tool plan diet activity use course study conjunction full Health Canada educational tool plan 5-month increase activity reduction screen time . Planning parent child together within context environment , developmental stage food activity preference anticipate improve program 's success . A focus fun yet feasible activity assist child parent adhere program . Expert researcher health care professional design Health Canada tool . In fact tool use Montreal Children 's Hospital obesity clinic . The activity guide successfully use 4 week family program enhance activity .</detailed_description>
