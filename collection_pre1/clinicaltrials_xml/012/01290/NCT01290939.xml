	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , lomustine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know regimen bevacizumab give together lomustine effective treating patient glioblastoma multiforme first recurrence . PURPOSE : The primary objective study investigate whether addition bevacizumab lomustine improve overall survival ( OS ) patient recurrent glioblastoma compare treatment lomustine alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine therapeutic role bevacizumab well favorable approach treatment optimization sequence combination bevacizumab lomustine patient glioblastoma multiforme first recurrence . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord institution , WHO performance status ( 0 v &gt; 0 ) , steroid administration ( yes v ) , large diameter tumor ( ≤ 40 mm v &gt; 40 mm ) . Patients randomize 2:1 ratio 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm 1 : Lomustine 90 mg/m² every 6 week ( cap . 160 mg ) + bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 week ( progression treatment accord investigator discretion ) . In absence hematological toxicity &gt; grade 1 first cycle dose lomustine escalate 110 mg/m² ( cap 200 mg ) second cycle . - Arm 2 ( control arm ) : Lomustine single agent 110 mg/m² every 6 week ( cap . 200 mg ) ( progression treatment accord investigator discretion ) . One cycle define arbitrarily ( due lomustine sequence ) 6 week arm . Day 1 cycle first day medication take . Previously collect blood tumor tissue sample analyze MGMT methylation status , isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 , biomarkers VEGF pathway . Patients caregivers/relatives complete quality-of-life questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-C30 EORTC-BN20 ) baseline , 12 week , every 12 week completion study therapy . Patients also undergo neurocognitive assessment baseline , 12 week , every 12 week completion study therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week .</detailed_description>

Chemotherapy must complete least 4 week prior randomization prior temozolomide No current recent ( within 4 week randomization ) treatment another investigational drug No prior treatment bevacizumab VEGF inhibitor VEGFReceptor signal inhibitor No prior treatment nitrosoureas Patient may operate recurrence . If operate : residual measurable disease surgery require surgery must confirm recurrence postsurgery MRI available within 48 hour follow surgery Surgery complete least 2 week randomization patient fully recover Craniotomy intracranial biopsy site must adequately heal free drainage cellulitis , underlie cranioplasty must appear intact time randomization . Study treatment initiate &gt; 28 day follow last surgical procedure ( include biopsy , surgical resection , wound revision , major surgery involve entry body cavity ) For non operate patient recurrent disease must least one bidimensionally measurable contrastenhancing lesion clearly define margin MRI scan , minimal diameter 10 mm , visible 2 axial slice 5 mm apart , base MRI scan do within two week prior randomization Stable decreasing dosage steroid 7 day prior baseline MRI scan . Patients require anticonvulsant therapy must take nonenzyme induce antiepileptic drug ( nonEIAED ) . Patients previously EIAED must switch nonEIAED least 2 week prior randomization No non tumor relate surgery invasive procedure ( major surgical procedure , open biopsy significant traumatic injury ) within 4 week prior randomization , anticipation need major surgery course study treatment .
