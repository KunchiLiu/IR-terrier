	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , double blind , control clinical study compare two dos immunoselected , culture-expanded , nucleated , allogeneic adult MPCs combine hyaluronic acid two control intradiscal injection subject chronic low back pain ( &gt; 6 month ) due moderate DDD one lumbar level L1 S1 unresponsive conservative therapy least 3 month ( include physical therapy ) . After screen injection visit , subject evaluate clinically radiographically 30 day , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 36 month injection . Subjects evaluate time point safety .</detailed_description>
