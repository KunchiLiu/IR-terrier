	<brief_summary>The yellow fever vaccine live , attenuate virus result robust immune response , especially T cell compartment . We study immune response live viral infection use yellow fever vaccine model live viral infection . In study , interested look process lifespan yellow fever specific CD8 T cell . We plan accomplish measuring DNA replication cell proliferation human use naturally occur stable isotope call deuterium ( D20 ) . This technique use track turnover number human cell type vivo . We plan use D20 label track YFV specific CD8+ T cell human vaccinee positive specific HLA type , HLA A202 . Deuterium label water ( D2O ) , also know heavy water physically chemically similar ordinary drinking water . In water , two hydrogen atom bond oxygen create H20 . However deuterated water , deuterium atom replace hydrogen atom . Deuterium form hydrogen extra neutron . This neutron give atom extra weight , hence name `` heavy water . '' This extra weight detect lab sensitive instrument . Scientists use heavy water tracer gain well understand animal human metabolic rate . Deuterium fact already water drink daily . It radioactive , occur naturally concentration 1 part per 5,000 . Researchers use heavy water since 1934 safe effective tool clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Able understand give inform consent 2 . Age 1845 year 3 . Participants agree take live vaccine 30 day ( 14 day inactivate ) yellow fever vaccination 4 . Women child bear potential must agree use effective birth control least 2 month yellow fever vaccination . A negative urine pregnancy test must document prior vaccination prior initiation drink deuterium label water . 5 . Must positive HLA A202 allele 1 . Travel live country/area endemic yellow fever 2 . History previous yellow fever , West Nile , Dengue , St. Louis encephalitis , Japanese encephalitis vaccination infection 3 . Any history allergy egg , chicken gelatin previous vaccine 4 . A history medical condition result impaired immunity ( HIV infection , cancer , particularly leukemia , lymphoma , use immunosuppressive antineoplastic drug Xray treatment ) . Persons previous skin cancer cure nonlymphatic tumor exclude study . 5 . History HIV infection , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C infection 6 . History chronic medical condition consider progressive ( ex , diabetes , heart disease , lung disease , liver disease , kidney disease , gastrointestinal disease uncontrolled hypertension ) . Use systemic immunosuppressive medication ( ex , prednisone ) 2 week past 3 month 7 . History excessive alcohol consumption , drug abuse , psychiatric condition , social condition occupational condition opinion investigator would preclude compliance trial 8 . Thymus gland problem ( myasthenia gravis , DiGeorge syndrome , thymoma ) removal thymus gland history autoimmune disorder . 9 . Recipient blood product immune globulin product within 42 day vaccination visit 10 . Pregnant woman nurse mother woman plan become pregnant within 2 month receive yellow fever vaccination . 11 . Any condition opinion investigator would interfere proper conduct trial</criteria>
