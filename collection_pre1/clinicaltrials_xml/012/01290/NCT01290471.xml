	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Tolerability U3-1565 Subjects With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct 2 phase : dose-escalation phase correspond Part 1 dose-expansion phase articulate 2 concomitant part ( i.e. , Parts 2a 2b ) . All part study single arm open label . In part , tumor assessment perform screen every 3 cycle thereafter , subject remain study . U3-1565 clinical activity assess measure tumor response physical examination image accord RECIST version 1.1 , applicable .</detailed_description>

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status = &lt; 1 . Men woman &gt; = 18 year age . Willing provide preexist diagnostic resect tumor sample , paraffin embed section , available . Willing , enrollment Part 2b , provide tumor biopsy treatment . For female subject , postmenopausal ( menstrual period minimum 12 month ) surgically sterile , otherwise childbearing potential , negative urine serum pregnancy test entry study , use maximally effective birth control course study , willing use contraception 6 month follow last study drug administration . For male subject , surgically sterile willing use double barrier contraception method upon enrollment , course study , 6 month follow last study drug administration . Able comprehend , sign , date current Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve informed consent form ( ICF include Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act [ HIPAA ] authorization , applicable ) performance studyspecific procedure test . History lymphoma , leukemia , hematopoietic malignancy . History human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity . HIV test require establish eligibility . History bleed diathesis . History idiosyncratic reaction antibody drug product . History stem cell bone marrow transplant . History myocardial infarction ( MI ) within 6 month enrollment , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( CHF ; New York Heart Association &gt; Class II ) , unstable angina unstable cardiac arrhythmia require medication History clinically significant pulmonary disease receive epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) target agent . Any concomitant medical condition would increase risk toxicity , opinion Investigator Sponsor . Clinically active brain metastasis define symptomatic requiring treatment steroid anticonvulsant . Unresolved toxicity prior anticancer therapy define toxicity , except alopecia , yet resolve National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 Grade = &lt; 1 baseline value . Subjects chronic Grade 2 toxicity may eligible discretion Investigator Sponsor ( eg , Grade 2 chemotherapyinduced neuropathy ) . Mean QTcF ( Fridericia 's correction ) interval &gt; 450 msec male subject &gt; 470 msec female subject , base screen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Moderate severe cardiac valvular abnormality identify echocardiography screen . Hematological value , follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1.5 X 109/L Platelet count &lt; 100 X 109/L Hemoglobin ( Hb ) &lt; 9 g/dL Renal function , follow : Creatinine &gt; 1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min , calculate use modify Cockcroft Gault equation . Hepatic function , follow : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &gt; 3 X ULN ( liver metastasis present , &gt; 5 X ULN ) .
