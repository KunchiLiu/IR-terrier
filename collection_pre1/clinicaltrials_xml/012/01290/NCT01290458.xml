	<brief_summary>Consumption vitamin supplement common practice among athlete people participate health promote exercise program . The reason interest vitamin supplement primarily observation enhance production reactive oxygen nitrogen specie ( RONS ) influence fundamental biological process , gene expression , signal transduction enzyme activity . In muscle exercise physiology context , low level RONS require normal force production , whereas mark increase RONS cause contractile dysfunction , result muscle weakness fatigue . On hand RONS involve signal pathway serve up-regulate expression number gene exert favorable effect train adaptation . The present study employ valid eccentric exercise model examine influence combine vitamin C E supplementation acute chronic eccentric exercise muscle damage performance , redox status , hemolysis lipid lipoprotein profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Antioxidant Vitamin Supplementation Muscle Performance Redox Status After Eccentric Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically shift paradigm regard effect antioxidant supplementation muscle performance redox status . In fact , back 80 's 90 's relevant study report `` positive '' effect antioxidant supplementation muscle performance , muscle damage redox status . On hand , last five year , increase number well-received study appear point towards negative impact antioxidant supplementation . Moreover , much study past specifically address effect antioxidant supplementation exercise adaptation take place chronic exercise . Regarding latter , report recently antioxidant supplementation greatly decrease train efficiency prevents many cellular adaptation chronic exercise . Nevertheless , debate still open equal number recent study report reverse i.e . positive effect antioxidant supplementation exercise adaptation virtually effect antioxidant supplementation exercise adaptation . Eccentric muscle work essential part daily activity human , walk , particular , walk downhill descend stair . The notable well-described effect eccentric exercise muscle damage peak one three day exercise . Eccentric exercise cause effect muscle damage , activation several transcription factor favorable change lipid lipoprotein profile . In double-blinded fashion , men receive either daily oral supplementation vitamin C ( 1g ) vitamin E ( 400IU ) placebo eleven week . Following baseline test , volunteer perform eccentric exercise session two time per week four week . Before chronic eccentric exercise volunteer subject one session acute eccentric exercise , physiological measurement perform well blood sample muscle biopsy collect . The aims present research investigate : - effect antioxidant vitamin supplementation 4 week muscle performance , redox status , hemolysis lipid lipoprotein profile , - effect acute bout eccentric exercise muscle performance , redox status , hemolysis lipid lipoprotein profile untrained individual supplement without antioxidant vitamin , - effect 4 week eccentric train muscle performance , redox status , hemolysis lipid lipoprotein profile untrained individual supplement without antioxidant vitamin , - effect acute bout eccentric exercise muscle performance , redox status , hemolysis lipid lipoprotein profile individual train 4 week supplement without antioxidant vitamin .</detailed_description>
