	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives Cohort A ‐‐ monotherapy : To determine efficacy AMG 386 participant recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) measure 6‐month progression‐free survival ( PFS6 ) Cohort B - combination therapy : Phase I To determine maximum tolerate dose AMG 386 combination bevacizumab give 10mg/kg every 2 week participant recurrent glioblastoma . Phase II To determine efficacy AMG 386 plus bevacizumab participant recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) measure 6‐month progression‐free survival ( PFS6 ) . Secondary Objectives : To evaluate radiographic response cohort population . To evaluate overall survival cohort population . To assess time‐to‐progression cohort population . To investigate safety profile cohort population . Exploratory Objectives : To evaluate expression factor associate tumor angiogenesis use multiple cytokine assay among participant undergo therapy AMG 386 response therapy development resistance . This open‐label Phase I/II study AMG 386 monotherapy AMG 386 combination bevacizumab . Two cohort accrue assess sequentially . Each cohort enroll participant recurrent GBM . Cohort A assess recurrent GBM participant receive AMG 386 monotherapy 30 g/kg every week . ( Cohort A initially accrue dose 15mg/kg , increase 30 mg/kg every week follow amendment ) . Cohort B ass recurrent GBM participant receive weekly AMG 386 plus bi‐weekly bevacizumab ( 10mg/kg ) . Cohort B start Phase I component determine MTD AMG 386 safe use combination bevacizumab . AMG 386 administer intravenously , , use combination intravenous bevacizumab , administer first . Patients require come clinic weekly study drug administration . For study purpose , cycle therapy 4 week . Treatment continue either evidence progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity , non‐compliance study follow‐up , withdrawal consent . The estimated rate accrual 60 participant per year . The estimated date accrual completion 1.5 year study initiation . The estimated date study completion approximately 12 month enrollment last study participant .</brief_summary>
