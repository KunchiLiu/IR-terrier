	<detailed_description>Huntington 's disease ( HD ) autosomal dominant genetic disease typically manifest begin adulthood form movement symptom , cognitive decline , psychiatric change . The propose research undertaken collaboration CHDI Foundation , Inc. , profit organization dedicate find treatment HD . CHDI 's goal develop help develop symptomatic disease modify treatment HD . To enable future therapeutic trial , CHDI sponsor several prospective , longitudinal , observational biomarker study pre-manifest early HD goal determine combination measure sensitive detecting change natural progression pre-manifest early HD . These study demonstrate progressive decline cognitive function patient huntingtin gene mutation begin pre-manifest period progress throughout course disease . These finding support use cognitive measure endpoints future therapeutic clinical trial . CHDI commit development cognitive assessment battery use HD therapeutic trial . There paper pencil computerize cognitive test give six week period non-HD control subject , pre-manifest HD early manifest HD subject .</detailed_description>
