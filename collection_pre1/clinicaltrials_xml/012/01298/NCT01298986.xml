	<brief_summary>Rationale : To determine beneficial ablation methodology individual patient paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation ( defined Heart Rhythm Society ) surgeon electrophysiologists work together convergent procedure ( hybrid ) place epicardial endocardial ablation line . Objectives : Catheter surgical ablation offer today patient drug refractory symptomatic atrial fibrillation . This study design assess efficient ablation approach patient paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation . In patient left atrium size le 5.0 cm , Hybrid approach ( pulmonary vein isolation perform surgically combine right leave atrial flutter line perform use transcatheter approach ) compare percutaneous catheter ablation isolate pulmonary vein apply leave right atrial flutter line removal LA appendage . In group patient leave atrial size 5.0-6.0 cm Hybrid approach go compare minimally invasive Cox-Maze III procedure . Our hypothesis regard rate return sinus rhythm antiarrhythmic drug 6 month demonstrate Hybrid approach go : superior percutaneous catheter ablation le 5 cm leave atrial group b : non-inferior compare Cox-Maze III procedure 5-6 cm leave atrial cm group . We hypothesize safety procedure show difference difference clinical complication group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Type : This experimental study patient present either paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation randomize base left atrial size ( ≤ 5.0 &gt; 5.0 &lt; 6.1 cm ) receive hybrid ablation approach vs percutaneous catheter procedure ablation include pulmonary vein isolation leave right atrial flutter line patient leave atrium ≤ 5.0 cm . hybrid approach compare Cox Maze III procedure patient leave atrium &gt; 5.0 &lt; 6.1 cm . Study Design : One hundred fifty two patient ( n=152 ) persistent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation present surgical catheter ablation intervention enrol . The study take place Inova Heart Vascular Institute Falls Church , VA specially design hybrid surgical suite cardiovascular operate area . We expect enrollment take ( two year study duration ) . Patients include present ablation paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation define Heart Rhythm Society leave atrium &lt; 6.1 cm ( volume ) . Patients exclude present long stand persistent atrial fibrillation define Heart Rhythm Society , require cardiac surgery , unable take anticoagulation require prescribe anti arrhythmic medication reason atrial fibrillation , leave atrium measure great 6.0 cm ( volume ) , previous catheter ablation atrial fibrillation ( Do exclude prior AVNRT ) pacemaker , less 18 year age , unable unwilling follow accord set protocol include implantation heart monitor 6 week prior ablation procedure . Study Methodology : This experimental study patient present either paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation randomize base left atrial size . For patient left atrium size le 5.0 cm , Hybrid approach ( pulmonary vein isolation perform surgically combine right leave atrial flutter line perform use transcatheter approach ) compare percutaneous catheter ablation isolate pulmonary vein apply leave right atrial flutter line . In group patient leave atrial size 5.0-6.0 cm Hybrid approach go compare minimally invasive Cox-Maze III procedure ( Figure 1 ) . Each patient regardless procedure leave atrial appendage close . All patient receive internal event monitor ( Reveal XT ) place 6 week procedure establish atrial fibrillation burden . All patient also give health relate quality life symptom frequency severity tool fill prior ablation 3 6 month post ablation . The primary outcome rate return sinus rhythm defined Heart Rhythm Society Guidelines ( sinus rhythm maintain anti arrhythmic medication monitor atrial arrhythmia great 30 second consider recurrence ) 6 month atrial fibrillation burden The secondary outcome include : Number type procedural complication Number embolic stroke The number major bleed event define need receive transfusion amount blood lose hemorrhagic stroke receive anticoagulation therapy . Reported improvement patient ' self report health relate quality life symptom frequency severity 3 6 month Statistical Methodology : Since proof concept study without prior literature obtain margin , use current rate return sinus rhythm margin determine sample size . This fully explain section 4.2 . Based calculation , 152 patient randomize describe . Descriptive statistic use characterize patient population . T-tests ANOVAs use look difference group within continuous data . Chi square , Fisher 's Exact test and/or McNemar 's Test use look difference among categorical variable . For analysis , two-sided p value &lt; 0.05 used determine significance . To analyze primary objective , percentage patient group return normal sinus rhythm calculate . Chi square analysis , logistic regression covariates require , used test difference odds return normal sinus rhythm treatment group arm study . Chi square and/or logistic regression also use assess secondary aim regard complication treatment group . For left atrial size &gt; 5.0 &lt; 6.1 cm arm study , test non-inferiority complication rate conduct use treatment effect 95 % confidence interval . These compare 10 % non-inferiority margin , ass whether treatment effect 95 % confidence interval fall entirely within margin . Lastly , repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) conduct examine secondary aim regard change health-related quality life treatment group .</detailed_description>
