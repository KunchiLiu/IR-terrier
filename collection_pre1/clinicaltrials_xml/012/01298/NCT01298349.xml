	<brief_summary>The present study aim examine face object perception process schizophrenic patient . Schizophrenia associate deficit visual processing represent key feature disorder . Previous study show schizophrenic exhibit deficit variety facial-processing task ( e.g. , face recognition , recognition facial expression ) , may severely hinder patient ' interpersonal social skill . Some investigator attribute deficit impairment configural processing schizophrenia . That , impairment ability process spatial relation constituent part configuration ( e.g. , space eye give face ) . To date , study aim investigate possibility ( e.g. , Schwartz et al. , 2002 ; Yong-Wook et al. , 2008 ) yield conflict result . Additionally , yet clear whether hypothesized impairment configural processing restrict face , whether general nature apply object well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In present study investigate relative contribution component versus configural property face object perception schizophrenic control subject . To end , design series experiment base former work Kimchi Palmer ( 1982 ) , Ph.D. dissertation conduct supervision Prof. Ruth Kimchi IIPDM . Experiment 1 investigates relative role local part versus global configuration object perception apply technique formalize Kimchi Palmer ( 1982 ) . Participants present hierarchical figure , large figure ( e.g. , `` global '' triangle ) construct small figure ( e.g. , `` local '' square ) . Participants ( schizophrenic control ) perform similarity-judgment task . In experimental trial , participant present triad stimulus : standard figure two comparison figure . Participants ask determine two comparison figure similar standard . Each figure consist global square triangle make local square triangle . In `` configuration '' comparison figure different element arrange configuration standard figure . In `` element '' comparison figure , elements standard figure use , arrange different configuration . The number element use construct standard figure vary . Previous data normal perceiver ( Kimchi &amp; Palmer , 1982 ) show number element increase ( size decrease ) perceiver tend base similarity judgment global configuration , rather local element . If schizophrenic impaired ability process configural information similarity judgment mainly rely local element rather global configuration . Experiment 2 examines relative contribution facial component ( e.g. , eye , nose , mouth ) versus configural property ( e.g. , space eye ) face perception , apply Garner 's speeded classification paradigm ( Garner , 1974 ) . We previously apply paradigm Ph.D. dissertation study face perception normal perceiver . The stimulus set consist four face create orthogonally combine component ( eye , nose , mouth ) configural information ( inter-eyes distance nose-mouth distance ) . On trial participant ask classify face either component configural information , two condition . In control condition one facial dimension varies ( e.g. , component ) dimension ( e.g. , configural information ) hold constant . In filter condition two dimension vary orthogonally . Equal performance control filter condition indicate participant able selectively attend relevant dimension - dimension process independently . Poorer performance filter condition control condition - Garner interference - indicate possible selectively attend one dimension ignore another , irrelevant dimension - dimension process interactively . Results normal perceiver reveal symmetric Garner interference upright face : participant unable selectively attend component ignore irrelevant variation configural information , vice versa . These result imply perceptual interdependence processing component configural information . If schizophrenic impaired ability process configural information patient able selectively attend component ignore irrelevant variation configural information , vice versa . This pattern would indicate relative dominance component configural property upright face process schizophrenia patient .</detailed_description>
