	<brief_summary>Tamoxifen classical treatment breast metastatic cancer 3rd generation anti-aromatase hormonotherapy adjuvant metastatic line . The Tamoxifen efficacy lower hormonoresistance mechanism due primary use anti-aromatases . The Pi3K-AKT-mTor pathway frequently associate hormonoresistance mechanism . This study aim check inhibition signal transduction pathway synthetic mTor inhibitor ( Everolimus ) could improve efficacy Tamoxifen .</brief_summary>
