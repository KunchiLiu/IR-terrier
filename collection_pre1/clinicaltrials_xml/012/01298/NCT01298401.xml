	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , ganitumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Specialized radiation therapy , 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy , delivers high-dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose ganitumab give together gemcitabine hydrochloride follow radiation therapy , ganitumab , capecitabine , maintenance therapy treat patient locally advanced cancer pancreas .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate maximum dose ganitumab , target dose 20 mg/kg , give concurrently capecitabine radiotherapy follow induction ganitumab gemcitabine hydrochloride patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer . Secondary - To evaluate safety profile induction therapy comprise ganitumab gemcitabine hydrochloride , follow ganitumab concurrent chemoradiation , subsequently maintenance ganitumab gemcitabine hydrochloride disease progression patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer . - To evaluate response overall survival patient treat maximum dose ganitumab give concurrently capecitabine radiotherapy follow induction ganitumab subsequently follow maintenance ganitumab gemcitabine hydrochloride disease progression . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study ganitumab follow expand cohort study . Induction therapy : Patients receive ganitumab IV 1-2 hour day 1 15 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course . Concurrent therapy : Beginning 10-28 day later , patient undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy daily , 5 day week 5.5 week begin day 1 . Patients also receive concurrent ganitumab IV 1-2 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily day 1-5 weekly 5.5 week . Maintenance therapy : Beginning 21-42 day later , patient receive ganitumab IV 1-2 hour day 1 15 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 4 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
