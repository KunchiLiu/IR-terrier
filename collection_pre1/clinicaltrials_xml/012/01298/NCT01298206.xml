Several report associate certain underlying condition severe illness . Such condition pregnancy , asthma , diabetes , obesity , heart disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Case-control Study Pandemic A/H1N1 Influenza Risk Factors In Lebanon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study measure risk protective factor associate pandemic A/H1N1 infection . This study also able estimate risk factor severe illness require hospitalization lead death . These factor : travel history , exposure confirm suspected case , obesity , pregnancy , influenza vaccination history , residency nursing home , attendance daycare , tobacco use , comorbidities ( pulmonary disease , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , renal insufficiency ) . Unlike descriptive study , analytical case-control study enable accurately measure strength association potential risk factor outcome . By isolate virus specimen collect case , study able characterize virus document genetic mutation antiviral resistance . The main objective study : 1 . To investigate risk factor infection pandemic A/H1N1 virus . 2 . To characterize influenza virus cause infection . 3 . If enough severe case enrol make statistically feasible , study investigate risk factor severe illness death associate infection pandemic A/H1N1 virus .</detailed_description>
