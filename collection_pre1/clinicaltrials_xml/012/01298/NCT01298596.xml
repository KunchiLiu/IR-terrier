	<brief_title>Cryotherapy vs. LEEP Treat Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ( CIN ) 2/3 Among HIV-positive Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recent scale-up antiretroviral treatment program resource-limited setting provide unprecedented opportunity implement comprehensive cervical cancer screen treatment program woman , virtue HIV , significant risk cervical disease . Unfortunately , even screen offer free charge million woman live HIV , unclear treatment modality pre-cancerous cervical lesion effective since HIV appear affect outcome treatment increase recurrence severity cervical disease . Cervical treatment may also increase shed HIV cervix may put discordant couple risk possibly spread HIV widely . This study propose randomize HIV-positive woman cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 3 ( CIN 2 3 ) cryotherapy vs. loop electrosurgical excision procedure ( LEEP ) measure recurrence cervical disease group 2-years follow-up well HIV shed cervix 6 week treatment . Our hypothesis compare cryotherapy , LEEP significantly likely prevent recurrence cervical lesion 2 year follow-up less likely cause shed HIV-1 cervix 3 week follow-up .</detailed_description>
