	<brief_title>Intravitreal Bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) Versus Intravitreal Dexamethasone ( Ozurdex™ ) Persistent Diabetic Macular Oedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy common cause severe loss vision common cause blindness individual age 20 65 year developed country . Swelling central retina , `` macular oedema '' , common cause visual loss diabetic retinopathy . Diabetic macular oedema ( DMO ) treat laser photocoagulation area leak macula accord establish guideline take account extent leak proximity centre macula , `` fovea '' . This treatment always work , however , inherently destructive . New drug become available appear reduce risk loss vision eye advance diabetic macular oedema laser treatment unlikely beneficial . Intravitreal injection slow-release steroid formulation Ozurdex™ , slow release formulation dexamethasone , propose new modality treat clinically significant DMO . We recently conduct randomised clinical trial demonstrate treatment intravitreal triamcinolone ( IVTA ) lead reduction DMO improve vision eye . Another class drug , inhibitor Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) , also appear efficacious . While drug appear reduce macular oedema improve vision short term , may difference could guide best use . Around 1/3 eye receive dexamethasone may develop elevated intraocular pressure cataract , manageable may complicate picture . Anti-VEGF drug local adverse event , however must give frequently ( 4-6 weekly v 4-6 monthly Ozurdex™ ) suspect may neurotoxic effect retina . Some authority suspect anti-VEGF treatment may associate small increase risk stroke heart attack treatment , even inject eye . This proven related drug , ranibizumab , still possible may occur bevacizumab . This , 2 year , phase II , prospective , multicentre , randomise , single-masked clinical trial sustain release intravitreal dexamethasone ( Ozurdex™ ) versus intravitreal injection bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) diabetic foveal oedema persist recur despite previous laser treatment , investigator believe laser treatment unlikely helpful .</detailed_description>
