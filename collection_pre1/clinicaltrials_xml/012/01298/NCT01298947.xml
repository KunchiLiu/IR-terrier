	<detailed_description>This prospective , two-arm randomize study . The control cohort ( PTX PTA group , Admiral Inpact Pacific Inpact , Medtronic-Invatec ) treat PTX-coated PTA balloon . The experimental cohort ( Laser+PTX PTA group ) treat photoablative atherectomy follow PTX-coated PTA balloon . Subjects meet definition Rutherford Clinical Categories 1 5 instent lesion locate superficial femoral artery popliteal artery knee joint eligible enrollment . The purpose feasibility study evaluate safety effectiveness prepare instent lesion photoablative atherectomy prior local Paclitaxel delivery compare local Paclitaxel delivery without initial photoablative atherectomy . Primary Outcome : Target Lesion Percent Diameter Stenosis ( % DS ) 1 Year define narrow point target lesion divide estimate native vessel diameter location determine ACL . Secondary Outcomes : The follow secondary outcome summarize study . 1 . Procedural Success : Defined ≤ 30 % residual stenosis follow procedure target lesion , without periprocedural complication , determine ACL . 2 . Major Adverse Event Rate 30 Days 1 Year : Defined major unplanned amputation treat limb , all-cause mortality within 1 year index procedure clinically-driven target vessel revascularization within 30 day index procedure . 3 . Improvement WIQ Score 6 Months 1 Year : Defined increase Walking Impairment Questionnaire ( WIQ ) score 6 month 1 year compare baseline . 4 . Improvement EQ-5D Score 6 Months 1 Year : Defined increase EQ-5D questionnaire score 6 month 1 year compare baseline . 5 . Improvement Rutherford Clinical Category 6 Months 1 Year : Defined improvement clinical status indicate decrease one Rutherford Clinical Category 6 month 1 year compare baseline , attributable target limb ( case bilateral disease ) . 6 . Improvement Ankle-Brachial Index 6 Months 1 Year : Defined increase ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) 6 month 1 year compare baseline subject compressible artery baseline ABI &lt; 0.9 . 7 . Clinically-Driven Target Lesion Revascularization ( TLR ) 6 Months 1 Year . Defined reintervention artery bypass graft surgery involve target lesion subject ≥ 50 % diameter stenosis presence recurrent symptom ( i.e . claudication ) ≥ 70 % stenosis without symptom ( i.e . decrease ABI ) . 8 . Patency Rate ( Peak Systolic Velocity ≤ 3.5 ) 6 &amp; 12 Months : Defined duplex ultrasound core lab measurement peak systolic velocity ( PSV ) ratio ≤ 3.5 target lesion clinically-driven reintervention within target lesion . 9 . Alternative Patency Rate ( Peak Systolic Velocity ≤ 2.4 ) 6 &amp; 12 Months : Defined duplex ultrasound core lab measurement peak systolic velocity ( PSV ) ratio ≤ 2.4 target lesion clinically-driven reintervention within target lesion . 10 . Minimum Lumen Diameter 1 Year : Determined angiographic assessment target lesion 1 year ACL . 11 . Net Lumen Gain 1 Year : Defined difference target lesion MLD baseline 1 year follow index procedure per angiographic assessment determine ACL . 12 . Patency Rate 1 Year : Defined ≤ 70 % stenosis per angiography determine ACL . 13 . Secondary Patency Rate 1 Year : Defined ≤ 70 % stenosis per angiography determine ACL , maintain repeat percutaneous intervention .</detailed_description>
