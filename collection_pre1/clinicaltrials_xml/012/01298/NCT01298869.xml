	<brief_summary>Clinical trial demonstrate efficacy HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccination ( Gardasil . Merck ) 3 dos day 1 , month 2 , month 6 low occurrence high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia placebo group . The immunogenicity efficacy HPV vaccine proven late stage chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) population . The cellular humoral immune responsiveness CKD population impair retention uremic toxin due glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) reduction , vaccination efficacy alter effective dose/schedule vaccine may need adjust , mostly increase CKD patient . This study aim investigate immunogenicity quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccination ( Gardasil . Merck ) current recommend dose/schedule CKD stage IV-V patient compare non-CKD patient . Although minimal peak anti-HPV response associate protective efficacy determine , equivalent immune response CKD non-CKD patient demonstrate study extrapolate CKD population . If less immune response result , intense dose/schedule vaccine study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study Immunogenicity Quadrivalent Vaccine Against Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) Types 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 ( HPV-6/11/16/18 ) Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 70 % sexually active adult become infected human papillomavirus ( HPV ) lifetime . HPV infection result anogenital cancer genital wart . These disease associate substantial morbidity mortality . Every year , 471,000 case cervical cancer diagnose worldwide . The 5-year survival disease ~70 % . The incidence HPV-related anal cancer double last 25 year . Screening program detect early disease available . Genital wart cause significant morbidity . Therefore , prophylactic vaccine reduces HPV infection greatly reduce burden HPV disease . This study aim demonstrate immunogenicity quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccination ( Gardasil . Merck ) current recommend dose/schedule ( day 1 , month 7 ) CKD stage IV-V patient compare immunogenicity vaccine CKD stage IV-V patient non-CKD subject historical cohort data .</detailed_description>
