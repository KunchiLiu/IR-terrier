	<brief_summary>The purpose protocol study effect intact hydrolyze yellow pea protein , compare intact hydrolyze whey protein , satiety , food intake , glucose metabolism healthy young men . The specific objective investigate effect 20 g available protein 4 different protein type ( intact hydrolyze pea whey protein ) water ( control ) satiety , food intake blood glucose meal . The specified amount protein choose base previous study intact pea protein suggest 20 g may reduce food intake pre-meal blood glucose 30 minute test meal . Whey protein choose reference protein extensively studied effect blood glucose food intake elucidate within laboratory .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Intact Hydrolyzed Pea Protein Food Intake , Glycemic Response Subjective Appetite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey , nearly two-thirds Canadians overweight obese . Obesity major risk factor metabolic syndrome , link condition type II diabetes . Dietary intervention increase satiety ( promote weight loss ) maintain normal blood glucose level noninvasive inexpensive compare pharmacological strategy . Thus , important identify types/sources macronutrients contribute healthy body weight increase satiety thereby reduce food intake . For instance , diet include pulse ( legume ) link low risk obesity/overweight . Pulses edible seed legumes pod-bearing plant include dry bean , yellow pea , lentils chickpea . They inexpensive healthy food high protein complex carbohydrate . Recently within laboratory , find include 5 cups pulse diet 8 week associate decreased body weight , waist circumference improve glycemic control . However , mechanism drive weight loss improve glycemic control need investigation . For instance , pulse may affect satiety , energy intake blood glucose high amount protein . Protein known satiate carbohydrate fat lead positive impact long-term body weight maintenance . Protein various animal plant source also show stimulate release satiety-related hormone like insulin , glucagon , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , peptide tyrosine tyrosine ( PYY ) ghrelin . The investigator recently investigate independent dosage effect pea protein ( 10 20 g ) pea fibre ( 10 20 g ) ad libitum food intake 30 minute pre- ( 0-30 minute ) post-meal ( 50-170 minute ) blood glucose response subjective appetite young men . Preliminary result indicate increase protein amount ( 10 g versus 20 g ) lead decrease pre-meal blood glucose response reduce food intake . Food-grade protein also available intact and/or hydrolyze ( partially digest control enzymatic process ) . Hydrolyzed protein easily digest absorbed , elicit faster rise plasma amino acid compare intact protein different hormonal metabolic response two form . As pea protein , data available differentiating effect intact hydrolyzed form blood parameter appetite human . Moreover , presence bioactive polypeptide may affect protein formulation ( i.e . polypeptide may cleaved/inactivated hydrolyzed pea protein ) . Research need determine whether effect pea protein differs glycemic response appetite pre- post-meal base form ( intact versus hydrolyze ) compare well-investigated protein . This research preliminary may lead future research population group , include young woman overweight individual . These result encourage increased consumption pulse fraction provide basis potential use pea protein development new functional food aim prevent manage obesity along control blood glucose diabetes management . Furthermore , result show pea protein comparable alternative whey , would favorable consumer shift away animal-derived protein health and/or environmental reason .</detailed_description>
