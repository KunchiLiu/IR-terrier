	<brief_summary>Cluster headache disorder mark frequent attack short-lasting , severe , unilateral head pain associate autonomic symptom . It severe head pain syndrome know . Currently , two common treatment cluster headache inhale oxygen injectable sumatriptan . These treatment work cluster headache patient , patient smoke may eventually develop contraindication triptans . New treatment option need . An alternative method oxygen delivery ( oppose continuous flow ) use demand valve control respiration rate , allow increase oxygen flow response increase demand . This system may efficacious stop cluster headache attack currently prescribe oxygen delivery system . This study compare effectiveness oxygen deliver via demand valve versus continuous high flow oxygen via non-rebreather face mask acute treatment cluster headache attack . All patient treat one cluster headache 2 treatment method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Demand Valve Oxygen Inhalation Therapy Cluster Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cluster headache primary headache disorder mark frequent attack short-lasting , severe , unilateral head pain associate autonomic symptom . The goal acute therapy cluster headache fast , effective consistent relief . In currently recommend dose strategy continuous flow 100 % oxygen give via non-rebreather face mask 7-15L/min , time improvement sometimes take upwards 20-30 minute effective cluster headache sufferer . An alternative method oxygen delivery ( versus continuous flow ) use demand valve control respiration rate , allow increase oxygen flow response increase demand . This delivery system may better stop cluster headache attack continuous flow model support hyperventilation enhance cerebral arterial vasoconstriction via state hyperoxia hypocapnia . Arterial vasoconstriction one hypothesize method oxygen abort cluster headache attack . This proof concept trial evaluate oxygen deliver via demand valve specific breathing technique effective cluster headache acute treatment effective traditional continuous high flow oxygen treatment non-rebreather face mask .</detailed_description>
