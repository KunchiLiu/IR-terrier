	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether treatment experimental drug call YF476 patient Barrett 's esophagus reduces expression tissue marker associate increase risk develop esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Gastrin Receptor Antagonist Barrett 's Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The association gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) cancer esophagus well-established . Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) condition line part esophagus change look like small intestine , change occur set GERD . Patients BE increase risk develop esophageal cancer . It recommend patient BE take medicine call proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) , greatly reduce acid produce stomach , hop reduce risk esophageal cancer . However , reduce acid level stomach , level hormone call gastrin increase . There laboratory data suggest gastrin may effect actually promote development cancer , include esophageal cancer . The investigator previously show BE patient high gastrin level likely either advance precancerous change ( also call high grade dysplasia ) cancer esophagus . As , obvious question raise : gastrin promote development cancer BE ? YF476 new drug block effect gastrin . Trials healthy subject demonstrate drug safe well-tolerated . The investigator therefore propose conduct randomize placebo-controlled trial YF476 patient Barrett 's esophagus . The primary hypothesis treatment YF476 reduce expression tissue marker associate increase risk develop esophageal cancer .</detailed_description>
