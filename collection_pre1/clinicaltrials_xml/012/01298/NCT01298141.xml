	<brief_title>A Multicenter Open-Label Treatment Protocol Observe Safety Replagal ( Agalsidase Alfa ) Enzyme Replacement Therapy Canadian Patients With Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety agalsidase alfa patient Fabry disease . Patients diagnose Fabry disease meet current Canadian guideline enzyme replacement therapy eligible enroll study receive agalsidase alfa dose 0.2 mg/kg body weight administer IV infusion 40 minute every week every week , base previous treatment . Shire implement change drug substance manufacturing process . Safety data collect patient receive product manufacture process . There change drug product formulation , manufacture site , manufacture process , container closure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cohort 1 : 1 . The patient document diagnosis Fabry disease . 2 . The patient sufficiently compliant study activity participate treatment plan , judge Investigator . 3 . The patient must meet current Canadian guideline enzyme replacement therapy Fabry disease meet one follow criterion : 1 . Ageadjusted glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 80 ml/min decline GFR &gt; 10 % sustain 3 month cause decline renal function exclude nephrologist 2 follow : Isolated proteinuria â‰¥500 mg/day/1.73 m2 without cause Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus Fanconi syndrome Hypertension 2 . Evidence cardiac involvement relate Fabry disease include 2 following : Left ventricular ( LV ) wall thickness &gt; 12 mm Left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ; Estes ECG score must &gt; 5 Left ventricular mass index ( LVMI ) 2D echocardiogram 20 % normal age Diastolic filling abnormality 2D echocardiogram accepted measure diastolic filling . E/A ration &gt; 2.0 deceleration time &lt; 140 msec Increase LV mass least 5 g/m2/year , three measurement minimum 12 month Increase leave atrium ( LA ) size 2D echo least 10 % normal age . In parasternal long axis view ( PLAX ) &gt; 33 mm ; four chamber view &gt; 42 mm Cardiac conduction rhythm abnormality : atrioventricular ( AV ) block , short PR interval , leave branch bundle block ( LBBB ) , ventricular atrial tachyarrhythmias , sinus bradycardia ( absence drug negative chronotropic activity ) Delayed posterolateral leave ventricular wall late enhancement MRI evidence advance cardiac disease fibrosis 3 . Evidence neurological involvement relate Fabry disease include 1 following : Stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) prior age 55 documented neurologist Acute onset unilateral hearing loss Acut monocular visual loss without cause 4 . Chronic , intractable diarrhea and/or abdominal pain/cramps , refractory standard management least 6 month . 5 . Chronic , intractable neuropathic pain , refractory analgesic standard pain management least 6 month . Cohort 2 : 4 . Patient must participate Study REP001a . 1 . The patient experience anaphylactic anaphylactoid reaction infusionrelated reaction , opinion Investigator , preclude treatment agalsidase alfa may interfere interpretation study . 2 . The patient otherwise unsuitable study , opinion Investigator . 3 . The patient enrol another clinical study , Canadian Fabry Disease Initiative ( CFDI ) .</criteria>
