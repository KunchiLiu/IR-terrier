	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study investigate allele frequency candidate gene Chinese diabetic patient without know diabetic retinopathy . Two hundred Chinese diabetic patient , age 20 - 75 year old , receive ophthalmic fundus examination ( either ophthalmoscope fundus camera ) within 6 month study recruit study . Each subject receive anthropometric blood pressure measurement . Then , fast blood sample take measurement glucose , HbA1c , lipid profile , biochemistry . An additional 10 ml blood sample take DNA extraction buffy coat . Meanwhile , participant receive structural questionnaire demography , personal history , medical history concomitant medication . Single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) candidate gene target chromosome region genotyped use ABI TaqMan assay . The difference distribution genotype allele study group analyze use appropriate statistical method . Through study , investigator hope build platform future large-scale genetic study diabetic retinopathy . The investigator also hope set priority candidate loci future study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) one frequent microvascular complication diabetes ( DM ) . Current guideline recommend patient DM receive ophthalmic fundus examination annually . DR pose serious threat health million patient DM . Nowadays , DR become leading cause new case visual impairment blindness among adult . Genetic factor likely account susceptibility DR difference DR incidence individual diabetes . Familial aggregation study show increase risk severe DR note among family member diabetes moderate heritability DR risk . Racial ethnic difference prevalence DR may also explain part influence genetic environmental/cultural risk factor . There 30 candidate gene involve metabolic mechanism functional pathway associate DR . However , consistent association candidate gene DR yet identify . The current study design build work platform future large-scale genetic study diabetic retinopathy . The investigator also hope set priority candidate loci future research . In present study , investigator plan recruit 200 Chinese patient DM receive ophthalmic fundus examination ( either ophthalmoscope fundus camera ) within 6 month study . Each subject receive anthropometric blood pressure measurement . Then , fast blood sample take measurement glucose , HbA1c , lipid profile , biochemistry . An additional 10 ml blood sample take DNA extraction buffy coat . Single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) candidate gene target chromosome region genotyped use ABI TaqMan assay . The difference distribution genotype allele study group analyze use appropriate statistical method .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients DM , diagnose 2010 American Diabetes Association diagnosis criterion . Men woman . Aged 20 ~ 75 year old ( inclusive ) . Who receive ophthalmic fundus examination within 6 month study : either ( 1 ) ophthalmoscope fundus camera ( result review qualified physician ) , ( 2 ) ophthalmoscopic examination perform ophthalmologist . Willing participate study signing inform consent . Women pregnancy . No document verify result ophthalmic fundus examination require inclusion . History mental incapacity language barrier may preclude adequate understanding cooperation study . Current concomitant illness would interfere subject 's ability perform study would confound study result , judged investigation physician .</criteria>
