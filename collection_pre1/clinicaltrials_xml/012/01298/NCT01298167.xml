	<brief_title>Absorbable Suture Versus Tissue Glue Repair Defects Following Mohs Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cyanoacrylate rapidly polymerize topical adhesive commonly use alternative traditional suture . Both cyanoacrylate fast absorb gut suture eliminate need suture removal represent significant saving patient staff time well relate healthcare resource . Both cyanoacrylate fast absorb gut suture currently routinely use epidermal closure Yale follow Mohs micrographic surgery . Physician preference currently dictate epidermal closure method choose give surgery . Cyanoacrylate report decrease trauma epidermal edge , minimize suture tract mark surgical scar , decrease risk inflammatory reaction suture material . Cyanoacrylate , however , allow wound eversion . Wound eversion minimize risk depress scar tissue contraction heal . As suture , fast absorb gut suture allow wound eversion report maximize likelihood good epidermal approximation . On hand , fast absorb gut suture degrade proteolysis result inflammatory reaction . Any inflammatory reaction skin heal affect final cosmetic outcome ( ie . post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation ) . A recent article ( Tierney 2009 ) , report tissue adhesive may effective achieve optimal cosmesis fast absorb gut defect trunk extremity . However , would like study two method repair facial wound , low tension area compare trunk extremity . Therefore , unknown exactly two method well epidermal closure facial wound follow Mohs micrographic surgery .</detailed_description>
