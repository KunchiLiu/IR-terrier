	<brief_summary>An abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) weaken enlarged area abdominal aorta , large blood vessel abdomen . Large AAAs ( &gt; 55 mm diameter ) carry high risk rupture , surgical emergency often lead death due severe internal bleeding . It suggest regular exercise training might limit rate AAAs develop . However , little known safety effectiveness exercise training patient . This pilot study examine feasibility supervise aerobic exercise training patient small AAAs ( 30 49 mm diameter ) . The investigator hypothesize exercise training safe useful patient small AAAs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) disease potentially lethal health problem old adult . New screen initiative identify many individual small ( 30 49 mm ) AAAs currently treatment option . Regular aerobic exercise might retard AAA disease progression , feasibility acceptability aerobic exercise patient AAA disease yet establish . This pilot study examine feasibility supervise aerobic exercise exercise advice-only patient small AAAs . A total 60 volunteer recruit randomly allocate one two group . Patients supervise exercise programme offer three supervised cycle ergometry/treadmill-walking session period 12 week . The feasibility intervention assess term recruitment compliance , attrition , change cardiopulmonary fitness objective measure free-living physical activity . Changes aneurysm size blood marker associate disease progression also monitor impact intervention health-related quality life assess use questionnaire . Outcomes assessed baseline 12 week . We also conduct focus group end trial obtain qualitative feedback patient . The result study inform design multi-centre randomise controlled trial longer-term follow-up clinical end-points .</detailed_description>
