	<brief_summary>A prospective multicenter trial start Korea investigate treatment efficacy Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system ( LNG-IUS ) endometrial hyperplasia ( EH ) patient . The LNG-IUS known alternative oral progesterone agent without incur disadvantage oral progestogen . Therefore , hypothesize therapeutic efficacy LNG-IUS similar oral progesterone , LNG-IUS would standard treatment EH patient n't want hysterectomy . LNG-IUS inserted uterus patient histologically confirm endometrial hyperplasia . Office endometrial aspiration biopsy transvaginal ultrasound conduct every 3 month outpatient The primary endpoint response rate . Secondary endpoint estimate consistency result office endometrial aspiration biopsy dilatation curettage ( D &amp; C ) procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE This prospective study aim analyze treatment efficacy LNG-IUS endometrial hyperplasia patient analyze accuracy office endometrial aspiration biopsy LNG-IUS place uterus . ENDPOINTS The primary endpoint study response rate . Secondary endpoint estimate consistency result office endometrial aspiration biopsy dilatation curettage ( D &amp; C ) procedure . STUDY SETTING AND PROTOCOL REVIEW This study single arm , prospective multi-institutional study . Its protocol approve Institutional Review Board clinical trial institution . PLANNED CLINICAL TRIAL PERIOD Patient Selection Enrollment : 12month IRB approval clinical trial Institution . TREATMENT METHODS LNG-IUS insert uterus patient histologically confirm endometrial hyperplasia . Office endometrial aspiration biopsy transvaginal ultrasound conduct every 3 month outpatient LNG-IUS inside uterus . At first year LNG-IUS insertion , D &amp; C perform anesthesia endometrial aspiration biopsy LNG-IUS inside uterus biopsy finding compare . If office endometrial aspiration biopsy show exacerbation , treatment LNG-IUS must stop specific treatment initiate . INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT - General Name/Brand name : Mirena - Bayer ② Active ingredient : levonorgestrel 52mg ③ Description : Mirena hormone-releasing T-shaped intrauterine system . A removal thread attach loop end vertical stem T-body . PLANNED NUMBER OF SUBJECT 80 patient biopsy proven endometrial hyperplasia ( 54 patient without atypical hyperplasia , 26 patient atypical hyperplasia ) STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The primary objective study estimate treatment efficacy LNG-IUS endometrial hyperplasia patient respect response rate . We expect different response rate depend atypia status . The atypia status determine office endometrial aspiration biopsy perform three month LNG-IUS . The expected response rate would 70 % Atypia , , 85 % without Atypia . Different estimation approach use depend Atypia status . For without Atypia , response rate estimate margin error 10 % . The sample size need estimation would 54 patient consider 10 % follow-up loss . For atypia , compare historical control expect response rate would 40 % . The sample size need comparison , total 26 patient need consideration 90 % power , 5 % one-sided test type I error , 10 % follow-up loss . The response rate 95 % confidence interval generate Z-test use comparison response rate . The Secondary objective estimate consistency office endometrial aspiration biopsy D &amp; C . Kappa statistic use</detailed_description>
