	<brief_title>Living With Aphasia : An International Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Synopsis : This three year longitudinal study , base gerontological model , product Aphasia Think-Tank establish Toronto 2007 . The original concept design , develop Queensland Hospital Australia , recently fund Australian National Health Medical Research Council . Rationale : Aphasia , occur 30 % ischemic first stroke , know negative impact quality life , increase incidence post-stroke depression , associate loss self identity , widespread effect partner , child , sibling , friend . Research conduct Australia United Kingdom ( UK ) provide evidence many person live successfully aphasia attribute successes speech-language pathology rehabilitation service . Inappropriate , irrelevant , inaccessible , non-existent require service cite . It also report current speech-language pathology service provider lack overall understanding long term goal aphasia rehabilitation objective may achieve . Hypothesis : It hypothesize analysis parallel qualitative quantitative data necessary examine full experience living aphasia ; also hypothesize specific factor act barrier facilitator successfully live aphasia . Methodology : The primary study site international research Community Disability Centre School Health Rehabilitation Medicine , University Queensland . The Department Rehabilitation Medicine , New York University ( NYU ) School Medicine collaborate following , extent possible , protocols Australian team respect subject selection criterion , measure use , test time-points . This prospective cohort study use parallel qualitative quantitative ( mixed ) method unique way quantify extent statistically model relationship determinant self-rated `` successfully living aphasia '' . Furthermore , permit understand underlying reason ( ) behind relationship . A unique aspect project use Assessment Living Aphasia ( ALA ) , new , aphasia friendly measure base World Health Organization International Classification Functioning , Disability Health ( WHO ICF ) . It specialize tool use self-rating scale focus specific theme emerge previous research . 204 subject recruit consent examine 3 , 6 , 12 month post-stroke . Considering attrition rate 25 % , estimate 153 subject provide study data . Each session videotape consist administration demographic questionnaire , Assessment Living Aphasia ( ALA ) , Western Aphasia Battery-Revised ( standardized measure investigate language understanding expression ) , social-convoy model , Barthel Index , Wepman Self-Correction Scale , Aphasic Depression Rating Scale . Anticipated Results : The outcome project lead good service people aphasia via fully articulate model predictive factor success follow aphasia . Not statistical model generate meaning factor relationship explain qualitative study . For example , decrease social network size satisfaction significant predictor variable successfully live aphasia , rehabilitation service must target loss social network first year variety available infrequently use intervention ( e.g . communication partner training . The qualitative data describe social network change ( e.g . le contact friend formal group ) ( e.g . communication mobility issue ) appropriate intervention target correct group . This research lead substantial change across continuum aphasia rehabilitation service throughout United States . Specifically , improve meaningful outcome person aphasia term live successfully aphasia . Results also streamline aphasia service meet need seriously disabled population often speak rely costly service many year stroke . This international project lead way change speech pathology practice meet need people aphasia around world .</detailed_description>
