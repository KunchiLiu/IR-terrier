	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn safety treatment combination bendamustine rituximab find effect , good bad treatment DLBCL . In addition learn combination bendamustine rituximab , researcher interested learn cancer treatment affect daily activity . Subjects ask complete Geriatric Assessment ( GA ) . GAs design gather information memory , nutritional status , mental health , level social support . GAs also design help health care team understand well subject carry day day activity briefly describe medical condition subject may . This assessment help health care team understand subject 's `` functional age '' ( age subject function ) compare subject 's actual age . The researcher also want learn chemotherapy affect age process body . This do measuring amount p16 blood . Researchers want understand chemotherapy change level p16 blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine + Rituximab Older Patients With Previously Untreated Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter Phase II clinical study investigate complete response ( CR ) rate therapy bendamustine combine rituximab old ( ≥65 year old ) patient previously untreated stage II-IV DLBCL deem poor candidate cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine ( Oncovin® ) , prednisone , rituximab ( CHOP-R ) ; n=37 . The hypothesis test regimen safe effective frontline therapy old DLBCL patient deem poor candidate CHOP-R. After 3 cycle therapy , patient less partial response ( PR ) come study , manage discretion treat physician . Patients achieve PR 3 cycle continue total 8 cycle therapy , patient achieve CR continue total 6 cycle therapy . Secondary objective include overall response rate ( ORR ) , disease-free , progression-free overall survival , evaluation toxicity tolerability regimen . This trial also include exploratory analysis design evaluate potential correlation expression senescence marker p16INK4a toxicity associate regimen . In addition , patient ask participate Geriatric Assessment ( GA ) tool trial .</detailed_description>
