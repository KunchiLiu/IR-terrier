	<criteria>Male female patient age &gt; /= 18 year Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis NSCLC Stage IV disease ( include patient pleural effusion previously classify Stage IIIB ) All following patient prior radiation therapy : 1 . Lesion ( ) use determination response previously irradiate increase size since completion radiotherapy 2 . The patient recover acute effect radiotherapy 3 . Radiotherapy complete least 4 week prior Screening Part 1 : Have least nonmeasurable evaluable disease ( e.g. , lesion small minimum size require measurability ; nonmeasurable lesion bone metastasis , malignant pleural effusion ) Part 2 : Have measurable disease , define least 1 lesion accurately measure least 1 dimension Performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Status Scale Have estimate life expectancy least 12 week Adequate organ function within 14 day prior first study dose ( ISIS EIF4E Rx carboplatin/paclitaxel , whichever occur first ) define : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1.5 x 109/L 2 . Platelet count &gt; /= 100 x 109/L 3 . Hemoglobin &gt; /=9 g/dL ( &gt; /= 5.6 mmol/L ) . Patients may receive packed RBC transfusion achieve level discretion investigator . 4 . Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless elevate secondary condition Gilbert 's Disease 5 . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 3 x ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN presence hepatic metastasis ) 6 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 3 x ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN presence hepatic metastasis ) 7 . Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3.0 x ULN 8 . Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; /= 60 mL/min per Cockcroft Gault formula Satisfy one following : 1 . Females : nonpregnant nonlactating ; surgically sterile , postmenopausal , patient partner compliant reliable contraceptive regimen , determine Investigator , 4 week prior Screening . Patients reproductive potential must test negative pregnancy Screen must agree use reliable method birth control study 10 week follow last dose ISIS EIF4E Rx . 2 . Males : surgically sterile patient partner must agree use reliable contraceptive method , determine Investigator study 10 week follow last dose ISIS EIF4E Rx . For Part 1 : discontinue prior chemotherapy , biological therapy , investigational therapy cancer least 4 week ( 6 week mitomycinC nitrosoureas ) prior study treatment recover acute effect therapy . Part 1 : More 2 prior chemotherapy biological therapy regimen ( approved experimental ) NSCLC , count adjuvant neoadjuvant treatment . A regimen define two consecutive cycle treatment . Part 2 : Any prior chemotherapy biological therapy ( approved experimental ) NSCLC include adjuvant neoadjuvant treatment Treatment another investigational drug , biological agent , device within 4 week ( 6 week biological agent ) Screening 5 halflives study agent , whichever long Patients treat untreated parenchymal brain metastasis leptomeningeal disease . Brain imaging require symptomatic patient rule brain metastasis , require asymptomatic patient . Patients know pericardial effusion Have active infection serious concomitant systemic disorder ( example , heart failure ) incompatible study ( discretion Investigator ) Presence history malignancy NSCLC , carcinoma situ cervix , nonmelanoma skin cancer . In case malignancy , patient may consider participation prior malignancy diagnose definitively treat least five year previously subsequent evidence recurrence . Presence underlying disease state associate active bleeding Ongoing therapy oral parenteral anticoagulant ( e.g. , heparin , warfarin/coumadin ) . Lowdose anticoagulant maintenance catheter patency low dose aspirin ( â‰¤ 325 mg/day ) nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent exclusionary . Concurrent treatment anticancer drug Preexisting peripheral neuropathy &gt; /=Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events Version 4.0 ( CTCAE ) Grade 2 Known history HIV , HCV , chronic HBV infection Previous treatment therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide siRNA Planned concomitant participation another clinical trial experimental agent , vaccine , device Have medical condition opinion Investigator , would make patient unsuitable enrollment , could interfere patient participate completing study</criteria>
