	<brief_title>Atypical Antipsychotic Treatment Effect On Brain Function In Schizophrenia Measured By FMRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The general aim study determine neuroanatomic basis cognitive pathology schizophrenia , well effect treatment typical atypical antipsychotic clinical symptom , neurocognition brain function , measure function magnetic resonance imaging . Subjects underwent randomized parallel group treatment trial consist : four-week Thiothixene treatment period , follow randomization , two-weeks cross titration , six-weeks double blind treatment Risperidone ( RIS ) Olanzapine ( OLZ ) . Twenty-three patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder fifteen healthy control subject initially enrol . Diagnosis establish SCID . Subjects assess two time point , baseline four week Thiothixene treatment follow , eight week double-blind atypical antipsychotic treatment . Controls assess . Symptom severity assess use PANSS . Cognitive function associate frontal temporal cortical region probe neurocognitive testing battery use standardized attention , executive function work memory task . Frontal temporal cortical function assess fMRI performance visual auditory oddball task . The visual task oddball task consist identify infrequent square present within series frequent square . The auditory oddball task consist identifying infrequent pitch-deviant target tone embed within series frequent standard tone . Thirteen patient eleven control complete fMRI baseline follow-up . The result indicate patient treated typical neuroleptic Thiothixene show significantly small extent activation superior temporal , anterior cingulate thalamic region compare control subject auditory oddball task . Although treatment atypical neuroleptic considerably reduce group difference cortical activation control patient , current sample size prove insufficient yield statistically significant group time interaction . The percent signal change data direction , prove less sensitive group difference extent activation . The group difference pronounce visual oddball task , direction .</detailed_description>
