	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give entinostat anastrozole together work treat postmenopausal woman triple-negative breast cancer remove surgery . Entinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use anastrozole may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Giving entinostat together anastrozole may effective treatment breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>0927GCC : Entinostat Anastrozole Treating Postmenopausal Women With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability entinostat combination anastrozole tamoxifen . ( Pilot ) II . To determine optimal dose entinostat combination anastrozole tamoxifen phase II . ( Pilot ) III . To determine baseline percentage change proliferative index ( Ki67 ) treatment entinostat anastrozole/tamoxifen triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . ( Phase II ) IV . To determine estrogen receptor ( ER ) expression treatment entinostat anastrozole/tamoxifen TNBC . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate baseline change expression level progesterone receptor ( PR ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , cytokeratin 5/6 ( CK5/6 ) , aromatase treatment entinostat anastrozole/tamoxifen . II . To assess baseline change tumor tissue histone H3 H4 acetylation treatment entinostat anastrozole/tamoxifen . III . To assess clinical pathological response preoperative combination entinostat anastrozole/tamoxifen TNBC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate level histone H3 H4 acetylation tumor change Ki67 ER . II . To evaluate baseline change gene methylation silence expression candidate gene tissue circulate DNA , include estrogen receptor ( ER ) -alpha , ER-beta , RAR-beta , cyclin D2 , Twist , RASSF1A , HIN-1 . III . To correlate entinostat trough concentration histone H3 H4 acetylation tumor well change Ki67 ER . IV . To evaluate baseline change global gene expression profile treatment entinostat anastrozole/tamoxifen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , pilot study follow phase II study . Patients receive entinostat orally ( PO ) daily day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 anastrozole PO daily day 4-29 . Patients undergo mastectomy lumpectomy . Tumor tissue sample collect baseline original diagnosis , surgery correlative study IHC RT-PCR . Blood sample also collect baseline , day 1 15 , surgery correlative study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
