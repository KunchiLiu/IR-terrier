	<brief_title>IGF-1 Inhibitor Pasireotide Lar Combination With m-TOR Inhibitor Everolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) B-cell malignancy plasma cell . It represent second common hematological malignancy , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma common.In protocol , propose regimen consist novel combination two agent promising preclinical activity , i.e. , pasireotide ( IGF-1 inhibitor ) everolimus ( mTOR inhibitor ) , explore efficacy therapy patient MM . We propose enrollment failure first two line FDA-approved agent , even patient high-dose chemotherapy SCT . In fact , overall survival SCT show identical `` early '' SCT compare `` late '' SCT , i.e. , administered time relapse . This provide important opportunity test novel therapeutic approach , reserve SCT relapse . The advantage strategy similar overall survival outcome achieve few patient undergoing SCT . Both everolimus pasireotide potential clinically effective myeloma . A phase II trial mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus , analogue everolimus , produce response rate 38 % relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . The IGF-1 inhibitor pasireotide promising agent , IGF recently find one important growth signal molecule myeloma cell . The combination everolimus pasireotide synergistic antimyeloma effect preclinical data invitro show combined inhibition mTOR inhibition IGF-1 lead synergistic increase cell growth inhibition multiple myeloma cell might represent potential new treatment strategy .</detailed_description>
