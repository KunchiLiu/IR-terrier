	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn safety effectiveness treat follicular lymphoma bendamustine rituximab follow radioimmunotherapy ( RIT ) use 90-yttrium ( Y ) ibritumomab tiuxetan . The researcher also test blood bone marrow BCL2 gene-Jh commonly find people follicular lymphoma ( FL ) look BCL2 gene-Jh responds study treatment . Bendamustine approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) progress within six month treatment rituximab rituximab-containing treatment regimen . Bendamustine approve FDA treat follicular lymphoma . Rituximab approve FDA treatment relapse refractory , low-grade follicular , CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . 90-yttrium ( Y ) ibritumomab tiuxetan approved FDA treatment relapse refractory , low-grade follicular B-cell NHL , include rituximab refractory follicular NHL . It also approve treatment follicular NHL previously untreated radioimmunotherapy achieve partial complete response first-line chemotherapy . Study participant receive bendamustine rituximab 16 week . If participant ' cancer respond well treatment bendamustine rituximab , receive 12 week radioimmunotherapy ( RIT ) . After RIT complete , participant ask return clinic every 3 month maximum 10 year follow-up visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective - To determine complete response ( CR ) rate overall response ( OR ) rate [ CR + partial response ( PR ) rate ] regimen bendamustine rituximab ( B-R ) , follow radioimmunotherapy ( RIT ) 90-yttrium ( Y ) ibritumomab tiuxetan subject untreated follicular lymphoma . Secondary Objectives - To characterize safety profile bendamustine rituximab follow 90-yttrium ( Y ) ibritumomab tiuxetan subject untreated follicular lymphoma - To determine CR OR rate B-R - To determine CR OR rate 90-yttrium ( Y ) ibritumomab tiuxetan specifically conversion PR CR - To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) - To determine time next treatment Exploratory Objectives - To determine molecular response B-R determine qualitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) BCL2 blood bone marrow examination ( require B-R ) - To determine molecular response 90-yttrium ( Y ) ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy blood bone marrow examination ( required RIT ) BACKGROUND Follicular lymphoma Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) encompass group malignancies lymphocytes vary histologic appearance , aggressiveness response therapy . According American Cancer Society , NHL 6th common cancer , 50,000 new case per year . Follicular lymphoma ( FL ) 2nd common type NHL accounting approximately 20 % newly diagnose NHL . FL consider indolent , , incurable lymphoma . The goal therapy treat symptomatic advanced stage disease induce maximum response minimal toxicity . The optimal treatment advance stage follicular lymphoma ( FL ) remain determined . Combination chemotherapy standard frontline treatment option disease alkylating agent cyclophosphamide common backbone combination . The common treatment FL United States rituximab combination chemotherapy cyclophosphamide , vincristine prednisone ( R-CVP ) cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine prednisone ( R-CHOP ) . The NCCN guideline also include fludarabine-based regimen , radioimmunotherapy . With addition immunotherapy ( rituximab ) chemotherapy , overall complete response rate improved.1-6 Furthermore , suggestive evidence overall survival may improve . Radioimmunotherapy ( RIT ) also effective salvage therapy indolent lymphoma transform lymphoma.7-9 In first-line setting , RIT follow chemotherapy increase CR rate PFS.10-12 Rationale combine bendamustine rituximab consolidation 90-yttrium ( Y ) ibritumomab tiuxetan As mention , combination bendamustine plus rituximab ( B-R ) appear non-inferior R-CHOP first-line treatment indolent lymphoma include follicular mantle cell lymphoma , show good tolerability profile less alopecia , potentially less cardiotoxicity , make rational choice first line treatment FL.17 When give chemotherapy radioimmunotherapy convert partial response complete response prolong PFS . The Follicular Lymphoma Ibritumomab tiuxetan ( FIT ) trial consolidation Yttrium-90-Ibritumomab tiuxetan versus additional therapy first remission advance follicular lymphoma show prolongation PFS ( 36 versus 13 month ) RIT arm.12 The PFS prolong regardless PR CR first-line therapy . The primary treatment include CVP , CHOP , fludarabine-based , chlorambucil , minority patient receive rituximab . The result also show RIT convert 77 % patient PR CR/unconfirmed CR ( CRu ) . An abbreviated course CHOP-R follow RIT show promise patient follicular lymphoma phase II trial report recently.11 Of 60 patient enter trial 55 patient complete protocol therapy . The median follow 19.7 month ( range , 0.26-35.9 month ) . For intent-to-treat analysis , complete response ( CR ) rate CHOP-R , assess CT PET imaging , 40 % 46 % , respectively . After RIT , CR rate improve , assess CT PET imaging , 82 % 89 % , respectively . In current study , propose first-line regimen untreated FL use bendamustine rituximab ( B-R ) ( bendamustine 90mg/m2 day 1 2 Rituximab 375mg/m2 Day 1 28-day [ +2 day ] cycle ) x 4 cycle follow RIT ; Zevalin ( formerly Biogen Idec/Cell Therapeutics , Spectrum ) . The advantage treatment B-R good side effect profile include significantly less alopecia less infectious complication . Currently bendamustine FDA-approved first-line therapy follicular lymphoma . 90-yttrium ( Y ) ibritumomab tiuxetan ( Zevalin ) radioimmunotherapy FDA approve patient previously untreated follicular non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) , achieve partial complete response first-line chemotherapy . Evidence suggest consolidation RIT lead long PFS . Since specific combination utilized first-line treatment FL , warrant investigation current study . This trial begin establish standard care first-line treatment follicular lymphoma . We hypothesize bendamustine plus rituximab follow RIT contribute among high CR rate see follicular lymphoma relatively low toxicity . Based result trial , would aim open large trial follicular lymphoma cooperative group setting , i.e . CALGB . Correlative Studies Background The BCL2 gene-Jh rearrangement common abnormality FL ( 14 ; 18 ) . This assess various PCR techniques.18,19 Patients assess molecular abnormality bone marrow baseline follow therapy . For instance similar Southwest Oncology Group study chemotherapy follow radioimmunotherapy use tositumomab/iodine I-131 tositumomab ( Bexxar ) follicular lymphoma , patient ask undergo serial bone marrow aspiration study entry , 4 week sixth cycle CHOP ( tositumomab/iodine I-131 tositumomab ) , tositumomab/iodine I-131 tositumomab PCR testing.20 The mononuclear cell fraction isolate marrow aspirate Ficoll-Hypaque sedimentation cryopreserved subsequent batch analysis use double nested PCR assay detect major breakpoint region minor cluster region BCL2 gene . Samples initially analyze fragment size use ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis PCR product transfer nitrocellulose membrane confirmation identity BCL2 translocation Southern blotting . The adequacy sample demonstrate use beta-globin positive control housekeep gene . Patients consider attained molecular remission marrow sample study entry contain detectable ( 14 ; 18 ) translocation become undetectable protocol treatment .</detailed_description>
