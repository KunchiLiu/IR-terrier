	<brief_title>Bafetinib Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine neuropharmacokinetics ( nPK ) systemic level bafetinib patient recurrent malignant brain tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate intrapatient variability nPK parameter assess intracerebral microdialysis . II . To document toxicity bafetinib cohort patient . III . To describe response rate , progression-free survival , overall survival patient malignant brain tumor treat bafetinib . IV . To assess expression Lyn Fyn kinases phosphorylation status pre-treatment tumor sample . OUTLINE : Patients undergo intracerebral microdialysis debulking craniotomy stereotactic biopsy . Beginning 24 hour later , patient receive oral bafetinib twice daily 1 day . Beginning least 2 week craniotomy 1 week biopsy , patient continue receive oral bafetinib twice daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 8 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
