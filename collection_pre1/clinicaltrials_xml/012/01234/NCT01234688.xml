	<detailed_description>End-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) associate several hemodynamic peripheral muscle abnormality could slow kinetics O2 uptake ( VO2 ) diminish tolerance incremental exercise . Although previous study show aerobic training able accelerate VO2 kinetics several disease population , little known positive finding also applicable hemodialysis patient .</detailed_description>
