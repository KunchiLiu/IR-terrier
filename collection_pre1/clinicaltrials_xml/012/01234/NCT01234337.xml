	<brief_summary>The objective phase-III trial compare efficacy safety sorafenib combination capecitabine versus capecitabine combination placebo treatment subject locally advanced metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer resistant fail prior taxane anthracycline anthracycline therapy indicate . After sign consent 28 day start treatment time number test carry include tumor evaluation medical history . The following test evaluation do within 7 day start treatment , Day 1 every cycle end study : Electrocardiogram , blood test , patient quality life questionnaires complete physical exam vital sign . Treatment give 21 day cycle sorafenib/placebo take every day 21 day capecitabine take first 14 day . Patients come weekly first 6 week Day1 every cycle first 2 cycle . During weekly visit subject check side effect blood draw happen study Day 1 cycle . Subjects follow overall survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Trial Comparing Capecitabine Combination With Sorafenib Placebo Treatment Locally Advanced Metastatic HER2-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research summary ( NRES , UK ) : Breast cancer commonly diagnose cancer woman lead cause cancer-related death among woman worldwide . However , despite advance treatment early-stage disease , 25-40 % patient develop recurrence spread part body largely incurable . The average survival patient breast cancer spread part body ( metastasis ) 2 3 year diagnosis , although number treatment option available , include various chemotherapy agent , single standard care exist . The study drug ( Sorafenib ) work inhibit certain pathway body contribute tumour growth formation new blood vessel ( angiogenesis ) . Angiogenesis play important role development , transformation spread breast cancer . Capecitabine approve chemotherapy drug patient whose breast cancer spread part body ( metastatic ) responsive class chemotherapy drug . Data Phase IIb clinical study suggest role combination Sorafenib Capecitabine treat locally advance metastatic breast cancer . Patients confirmatory Phase III study randomly assign receive either : - Capecitabine + Sorafenib - Capecitabine + placebo ( `` dummy medication '' active drug ) Participants continue receive treatment radiographic clinical progression disease , side effect require withdraw , pregnancy , protocol non-compliance withdrawal consent . Therefore length participation vary individual . This study expect close 31 March 2013 . This multicentre study take place across Europe , North South America , Asia , Australia South Africa . It anticipate approximately 519 participant recruit worldwide .</detailed_description>
