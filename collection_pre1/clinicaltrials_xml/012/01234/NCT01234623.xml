	<brief_summary>Human autologous serum ( AS ) eye drop successfully use treatment severe ocular surface disorder enhancement corneal wound healing , due growth factor ( GF ) content . Umbilical cord serum ( UCS ) contain even high GF concentration objective study prove whether UCS eye drop 1. effective heal corneal epithelial defect . 2. ameliorate painful subjective symptom</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The regular collection banking cord blood remain placenta baby 's delivery start early 1990s prompted observation cord blood show immunological immaturity allow avoid match donor-mother source patient-recipient , contain number haemopoietic progenitor stem cell therefore potentially safely useful field regenerative medicine . Cord blood collection occur umbilical cord cut extract fetal end cord . After collection , cord blood unit bag deliver lab , process cryopreserved . The main current clinical use cord blood allogeneic transplantation patient suffer severe blood disease physicians researcher make significant progress evaluate safety efficacy umbilical cord blood stem cell therapeutic us far beyond us blood disorder . Umbilical cord serum ( UCS ) contain many growth factor especially EGF TGF-beta1 concentration two-three time higher peripheral blood serum much high tear sufficient prevent squamous metaplasia . In addition , UCS contain anti-inflammatory cytokine protective effect . Current therapy SS-I GVHD relate dry eye depend upon clinical severity disease . From mild progressively severe involvement corneal epithelial damage , tear substitute , FANS , steroid , Cyclosporin A , contact lens shield topically apply alone combination . Autologous serum eyedrops option severe case well , since supply epithelial growth factor heal process epithelium . The use autologous serum eyedrop , however , controversial issue diseases inflammatory cytokine present peripheral blood , GVHD . The use cord blood serum base tear substitute recently propose literature treatment ocular surface disease neurotrophic keratitis , contain growth factor , neurotrophic factor essential component tear . Moreover , serum cord blood readily available cord blood bank quality control product therefore theoretically attractive topical use ophthalmology . The use cord blood serum eyedrops biological preparation display efficacy feature high drug term heal anti-inflammatory property absence chemical compound . In Italy biological product topical use ophthalmology treat corneal epithelial severe defect available . The originality present study base optimization standardization biological eyedrop prepare cord blood serum . The efficacy safety product topical use ocular surface disease evaluate . For purpose , follow method apply baseline endpoint ( 28 day treatment UCS eyedrops ) : 1 . Patients ' subjective symptom evaluation validate questionnaire dry eye ( OSDI ) 2 . Slit Lamp examination evaluation Tear Film Break Up Time , corneal fluorescein stain score , conjunctival lissamine green stain score , stain record digital photo estimate heal area follow 3 . Schirmer I test evaluate tear production 4 . Corneal sensitivity test ( measure Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer ) 5 . Tear osmolarity , ( TearLab , TearLab S.Diego ) indicator ability patient compensate 6 . Tear Clearance Rate , global indicator tear production tear evaporation 7 . Tear Proteomic evaluate tear protein profile 8 . Corneal Conjunctival inflammatory marker evaluation cell collect imprint scrap cytology Data statistically evaluate 28 day treatment match vs baseline use descriptive statistic pair data . Statistic outcome analyze caution due non-randomized study design .</detailed_description>
