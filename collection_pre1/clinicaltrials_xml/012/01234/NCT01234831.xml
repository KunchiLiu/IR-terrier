	<brief_title>A Novel Approach Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) Screening Colonized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared patient methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ( MSSA ) bacteremia , patient MRSA bacteremia remain hospital two day average median attributable increment hospital charge approximately $ 7000 . MRSA status determinant bed allocation , especially shared-room setting , represent common organization US globally . Based guideline Centers Disease Control Prevention , patient designate positive MRSA culture ( either colonize clinical isolate ) , require Contact Precautions . This requirement translate either cohorting patient similar precaution status ( i.e. , two patient MRSA share room ) placement private room hospital . Cohorting preferred infection control method , shared-room setting , common scenario , particularly hospital high occupancy . Individuals clear MRSA colonization spontaneously . In fact , 38 % patient MRSA-positive culture take great 3 month prior find MRSA-negative re-screening program conduct Massachusetts General Hospital Infection Control Unit 2004-2006 . Other study demonstrate majority patient likely clear colonization various time point original documentation MRSA infection colonization . There currently standardize approach accept guideline address screen clearance colonization grow pool patient previous MRSA colonization/infection . Many organization provide guideline screen , guideline base rigorous study , variety permutation , neither consensus acceptance adequate implementation among medical community . The status quo limit bed availability delay patient discharge rehabilitation facility , adversely affect quality efficiency , result use additional hospital resource . In addition problem associate patient flow admission discharge , precaution status result additional disruption patient care `` bed move '' accommodate use share room like patient need Contact Precautions . A patient 's precaution status affect his/her care admission discharge . During pre-admission , patient identify previously MRSA affect bed shortage delay admission emergency department . While admit , current practice , patient fact clear MRSA may cohorted active infection persistent colonization , put risk recolonization hospital acquire infection ( HAI ) . Finally , patient precaution MRSA often delay discharge rehabilitation nursing facility bed constraint similar experience acute care facility . We hypothesize use sensitive Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) method detect MRSA nasal swab facilitate identification true negative patient reliably single negative test shorter period time , thereby greatly facilitate ability complete test large proportion patient .</detailed_description>
