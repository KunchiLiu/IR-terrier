	<criteria>Provide write informed consent prior Screening . Age ≥ 18 year . Histological cytological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate . Metastatic disease curative therapy exist systemic chemotherapy indicate . Progression disease despite either medical surgical castration . If patient receive medical androgen ablation , castrate level testosterone ( &gt; = 50 ng/dL ) must present concurrent disease progression . Progressive disease define one following : Rising serum PSA level : two consecutive increase PSA level document previous reference value obtain least one week apart value third point ≥ 2 ng/mL . If third PSA level less second , additional fourth test confirm rise PSA ( i.e. , fourth value ≥ second value ≥ 2 ng/mL ) acceptable . Progressive measurable disease define increase sum diameter measurable lesion small sum observe appearance one new lesion assess CT scan . Bone progression : appearance 2 new lesion bone scan imaging . If patient surgical orchiectomy : The patient must androgen suppression treatment ( e.g . LHRH agonist ) , castrate level testosterone ( &lt; = 50 ng/dL ) , must willing continue treatment throughout study . The patient must discontinue treatment antiandrogens ( discontinue ≥ 4 week flutamide ≥ 6 week nilutamide bicalutamide prior Screening ) document disease progression follow discontinuation . PSA &gt; = 2 ng/mL Screening period . Performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Status Scale . Have estimate life expectancy least 12 week . Adequate organ function within 14 day prior first study dose ( ISIS EIF4E Rx docetaxel , whichever occur first ) include follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1.5 x 109/L . Platelet count &gt; = 100 x 109/L . Total bilirubin &lt; = 1.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; = 1.5 x ULN . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; = 1.5 x ULN . Serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 x ULN . Prothrombin time ( PT ) international normalize ratio ( INR ) within normal limit . Activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) within normal limit . Part 1 : Have 1 prior chemotherapy biological therapy regimen ( approved experimental ; previous hormonal therapy allow counted biological therapy inclusion criterion ) prostate cancer . This include treatment may receive adjuvant neoadjuvant setting . A regimen define two consecutive cycle treatment . Part 2 : Have prior chemotherapy biological therapy ( approved experimental ; previous hormonal therapy allow counted biological therapy inclusion criterion ) set prostate cancer . Have discontinue previous therapy cancer ( except treatment LHRH analogue ) follow : Part 1 : cytotoxic chemotherapy must discontinue least 4 week prior screen ; Part 2 : see Inclusion Criteria 11 . Part 1 : biological treatment ( hormonal treatment ) must discontinue least 6 week prior screen ; Part 2 : see Inclusion Criteria 11 . Hormone therapy ( e.g. , abiraterone , MDV3100 ) must discontinue 4 week prior screen . Radiotherapy must discontinue least 4 week prior screen , patient must recover acute effect therapy . Recovery toxicities prior therapy ≤ Grade 2 NCI CTCAE , version 4.0 ( Exception : toxicity view Investigator clinically significant safety risk therapy administration , include , limited : anemia , fatigue , erectile dysfunction , hot flash , lymphedema extremity , dizziness , cough , urinary incontinence ) . Men reproductive potential must agree use effective form contraception , determine Investigator , treatment period study 10 week follow last dose study drug . The patient willing able comply study visit schedule procedure , geographic proximity ( Investigator 's discretion ) allow adequate followup . Treatment another investigational drug device within 4 week biological agent within 6 week Screening 5 halflives study agent , whichever longer . Preexisting peripheral neuropathy &gt; = Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , Version 4.0 ( CTCAE ) Grade 2 . Patients treat untreated parenchymal brain metastasis leptomeningeal disease . Currently active malignant epidural disease also exclude . Previously treat epidural disease exclude patient study . ( Note : CT MRI brain need rule unless patient clinical symptom suggestive CNS metastasis ) . Have active infection serious concomitant systemic disorder ( example , heart failure ) incompatible study ( discretion Investigator ) . Presence history malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer solid tumor curatively treat least 5 year previously subsequent evidence recurrence . Presence underlying disease state associate active bleeding . Ongoing therapy oral parenteral anticoagulant ( e.g. , heparin , warfarin/coumadin ) . Lowdose anticoagulant maintenance catheter patency low dose aspirin ( ≤ 325 mg/day ) nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent exclusionary . Concurrent treatment anticancer drug . Inability comply protocol study procedure . Previous therapy strontium samarium . Patients irradiation ≥ 25 % bone marrow ( e.g . pelvic irradiation ) . Use herbal product , include saw palmetto within 1 week screen throughout study . Initiation treatment bisphosphonates , change dose , within 4 week assignment dose study . Patients take bisphosphonates dose regimen alter study unless medically warrant . Known history HIV , HCV , chronic HBV infection . Previous treatment therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide siRNA . Planned concomitant participation another clinical trial experimental agent , vaccine , device . Have medical condition , opinion Investigator , would make patient unsuitable enrollment , could interfere patient participate complete study .</criteria>
