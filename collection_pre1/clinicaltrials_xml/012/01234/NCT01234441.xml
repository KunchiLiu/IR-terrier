	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient receive hemodialysis treatment ( CKD stage 5 ) suffer variety co-morbid disease , many may mechanistically link .

As result abnormality , cardiovascular event 10 30 time great dialysis patient age- sex-matched subject general population . A variety pharmacological therapy commonly use help prevent attenuate progression CKD co-morbidities ; however , morbidity mortality population remain extremely high , indicate additional therapeutic strategy may improve health QOL population need . Recently , National Kidney Foundation recommend dialysis patient increase protein intake 1.2 g/kg/day help prevent protein malnutrition ; however , little known efficacy recommendation . Intradialytic ( dialysis ) protein supplementation show increase serum albumin levels11 , also increase amino acid uptake skeletal muscle , effect potentiate resistance endurance exercise . However , individual combine effect intradialytic protein supplementation exercise training lean mass , muscle strength , physical function unknown . Furthermore , intradialytic protein supplementation exercise train improve many risk factor associate CVD renal bone disease ( e.g. , plasma lipid , inflammatory variable ) , effect functional CVD outcome ( e.g. , arterial stiffness , VC , IMT , LVH , myocardial performance ) bone health dialysis patient unknown . The primary objective propose research evaluate efficacy intradialytic oral protein supplementation , without concomitant intradialytic endurance exercise training ( cycle ) , physical function , CVD risk , bone health . We also examine potential mechanism effect , determine improvement factor lead improvement QOL . Hemodialysis patient randomize follow group 12 month : 1 ) usual care/control ( CON ) ; 2 ) intradialytic protein supplementation ( PRO ) ; 3 ) intradialytic protein supplementation + exercise training ( PRO+EX ) . Primary Aim # 1 : Examine effect intradialytic oral protein supplementation exercise training physical function . Hypothesis # 1 : Physical function , assess shuttle walk test , improve PRO+EX PRO , compare CON , magnitude improvement great PRO+EX . In secondary analysis , also examine effect intervention variable related physical function , include lean body mass , muscle strength , activity daily live ( ADL ) assessment . Primary Aim # 2 : Examine effect intradialytic oral protein supplementation exercise training CVD risk . Hypothesis # 2 : CVD risk , assess carotid artery stiffness , improve PRO+EX PRO , compare CON , magnitude improvement great PRO+EX . In secondary analysis , also examine effect intervention factor related CVD risk , include carotid IMT , myocardial performance , LVH , aortic calcification , epicardial fat level . Primary Aim # 3 : Examine effect intradialytic oral protein supplementation exercise train bone health determine bone mineral density ( BMD ) . Hypothesis # 3 : BMD reduce significantly CON PRO+EX PRO . We anticipate BMD remain stable PRO+EX PRO . Because exercise bone loading ( i.e. , invoke ground joint reaction force ) , expect additive effect PRO+EX BMD .</detailed_description>
