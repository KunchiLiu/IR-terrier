	<brief_title>Study REOLYSIN® Combination With FOLFIRI Bevacizumab FOLFIRI Naive Patients With KRAS Mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reovirus Serotype 3 - Dearing Strain ( REOLYSIN® ) naturally occur , ubiquitous , non-enveloped human reovirus . Reovirus show replicate selectively Ras-transformed cell cause cell lysis . Activating mutation ras mutation oncogene signal ra pathway may occur many 80 % human tumor . The specificity reovirus Ras-transformed cell , couple relatively nonpathogenic nature human , make attractive anti-cancer therapy candidate . Eligible patient study include histologically confirm cancer colon rectum Kras mutation measurable disease . Cetuximab panitumumab show ineffective patient whose tumor KRAS mutation . Therefore , currently , patient KRAS mutation , option failure front-line therapy irinotecan FOLFIRI . Over past year , two randomize phase III trial demonstrate OS PFS patient increase bevacizumab combined standard FOLFIRI therapy . The trial Phase I dose escalation study four dose level , comprise cohort three six patient , determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity combination REOLYSIN® , bevacizumab , FOLFIRI . FOLFIRI bevacizumab administer first day two week ( 14-day ) cycle , REOLYSIN® administer day one five four week ( 28-day ) cycle . The study expect enroll 20 32 patient .</detailed_description>
