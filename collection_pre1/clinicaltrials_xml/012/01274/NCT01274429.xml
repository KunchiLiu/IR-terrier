	<brief_title>Peanut Oral Immunotherapy ( OIT ) - Initial Pilot Study Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal proposal produce new treatment would benefit subject peanut allergy lower risk anaphylactic reaction ( desensitization ) , change peanut-specific immune response subject peanut allergy ( tolerance ) . This research study test stimulation immune system improve peanut allergy . The approach investigator use peanut allergy call desensitization . A person become desensitize food take small , increase amount food help body become use food longer cause severe allergic reaction . The study also look safety immune system effect investigational study product , peanut protein . The word `` investigational '' mean study product still test research study approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . This project design study peanut oral immunotherapy ( POIT ) desensitize subject peanut hypersensitivity regulate oral systemic immune reactivity cause long-term tolerance .</detailed_description>
