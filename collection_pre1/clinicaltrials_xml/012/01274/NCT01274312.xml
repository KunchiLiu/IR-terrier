Recently , concept surgically create somato-sensory reflex arch bladder dysfunction SCI introduce . The concept promising , bladder also bowel dysfunction . However , well design study need perform recommend procedure large number patient worldwide .

	<brief_title>Somato-sensory Reflex Arch Spinal Cord Injury - Effect Colorectal Transport</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Spinal cord injury profound impact life affect . Quality life restrict immobility also severe neurogenic bladder bowel dysfunction . For example , 66 % spinal cord injury ( SCI ) patient empty rectum digitally , 75 % suffer faecal incontinence 9 % spend 60 minute time defecate . Neurological impairment due SCI permanent average age injury 28 year . The longevity individual SCI approach general population , accordingly , patient live several decade severe bladder bowel symptom . It estimate number individual SCI Denmark 3.000 year 10.000 person European Union sustain SCI . Even though clean intermittent catheterization successfully reduce mortality due urinary tract infection reflux though several new treatment modality neurogenic bowel dysfunction introduce , bladder bowel dysfunction still rank among top three cause impairment quality life SCI . Somato-sensory reflex arch : The concept pioneer professor Xiao . Animal study basic clinical research perform United States later human clinical study do Wuhan , China . The surgical procedure principle briefly summarize follow : All spinal nerve anterior efferent root posterior afferent root . For somato-sensory reflex arch ( `` Xiao procedure '' ) posterior ( afferent sensory ) root 5th lumbar nerve ( L5 ) keep anterior root cut anastomose anterior root lower segment , usually third sacral segment ( S3 ) . Thereby , new reflex arch create skin leg sensory part L5 spinal cord anastomosis via S2 S3 bladder bowel . Strong stimuli L5 dermatome , i.e . scratch electrical stimulation , initiate voiding ( 6,7 ) . Effects somato-sensory reflex arch neurogenic bowel dysfunction study , clinical experience indicate bowel management substantially facilitate . The Xiao procedure introduces completely new concept management spinal cord lesion greet optimism worldwide . The number patient operated China alone 3.000 centre United States , Germany Israel introduce modify . Furthermore , centre Australia , Finland Denmark plan introduce within present year . There , however , serious concern need address : 1 . Clinical follow-up do patient physiological study procedure equally small . 2 . In spite large number patient operated China logistic cultural factor prohibit effective follow-up . 3 . A minor improvement bladder bowel function may important Chinese patient without access treatment unknown whether Xiao procedure advantage patient western healthcare system . 4 . The mode action somato-sensory reflex arch incompletely study mode action bowel function study . Before widespread use somato-sensory reflex arch find utmost importance well design study validate even objective endpoint perform . Results study international impact either define indication completely new treatment principle , otherwise , prevent widespread use ineffective treatment . Hypotheses : In March 2009 core member multidisciplinary study team go study tour Wuhan , China . In Wuhan stagger number 600 patient somato-sensory reflex arch procedure perform 2008 . Based experience visit pose follow hypothesis : 1 . Somato-sensory reflex arch increase colorectal transport defecation . 2 . Somato-sensory reflex arch improve colorectal empty defecation . Patients Methods : Spinal cord injure patient Internationally , two indication somato-sensory reflex arch emerging : 1 . Adult patient bladder dysfunction due supraconal SCI ( medullar conus ) 2 . Children bladder dysfunction due spinal bifida . Most child spinal bifida motor incomplete lesion , accordingly , surgical procedure carry risk long-lasting even permanent loss motor function - typically loss dorsiflexion foot . Whether result procedure justify risk remains determine . In contrast , patient motor complete supraconal SCI , thereby complete loss voluntary muscle function level injury , run risk . Therefore , decide patient group ) offer procedure Department Neurosurgery . Initially , 20 patient undergo procedure . As method new , surgery follow-up perform strict monitoring emphasis neurophysiologic test potential complication . Approval obtain Ethics Committee , patient carefully inform neurosurgeon inform consent sign . Surgical procedure : The relatively minor surgical procedure describe previously . In summary : A hemilaminectomy L5-S1 performed . By mean neurophysiology test 5th lumbar root 2nd 3rd sacral root identify one side . The perineurium open motor root separate sensory . The motor root transsected microanastomosis create L5 S2 S3 . After surgery sprouting occur 12-18 month reflex arch functional . Time till clinical effect therefore also 12-18 month . The advantage procedure perform hemilaminectomy two segment surgical stress relatively small . The patient expect habitual condition within 48 hour . Post surgical monitoring : Even patient void somato-autonomic reflex arch stimulation , usually defecate . In spite , clinical experience China bowel function improve significantly . This possible left colon rectum receive stimulatory parasympathetic innervation spinal cord segment ( S2-S4 ) bladder . It show several paper , include group , colonic transit time significantly prolong SCI patient . Somato-autonomic reflex stimulation may therefore improve bowel function increase colorectal transport stimulation even absence defecation . As patient stimulate several time day cumulative effect colorectum may considerable facilitate colorectal empty otherwise induce . Our centre lead internationally develop scintigraphic technique assessment colorectal transport defecation previously find patient low SCI extremely reduce colorectal emptying defecation . We find scintigraphic technique extremely well suit study colorectal effect Xiao procedure . Scintigraphic procedure : The total gastrointestinal segmental colonic transit time individual determine . Based information two dose 111Indium take day-1 ( 2.6 MBq ) day-2 or-3 ( 3.3 MBq ) . On day-0 patient arrive Department Nuclear medicine 8 A.M. A double head Picker Gamma camera use image whole abdomen ten minute patient lie flat back ( period 1 ) . Then another ten minute record perform relevant dermatome somato-autonomic reflex arch stimulate ( period 2 ) . Then subject allow standardized meal stimulate gastrocolonic reflex . Within 30 minute SCI subject initiate defecation standard way ( stain , digital stimulation , suppository micro enema ) sit toilet . Finally , another ten minute record performed determine colorectal content defecation ( period 3 ) . The number count ten minute period approximately 80.000 . Comparison number count four segment ( coecum/ascending colon , transverse colon , descend colon rectosigmoid ) allow highly specific description luminal colorectal transport stimulation defecation . All subject study twice : Before surgery 18 month . Based relatively simple experiment follow three sub-studies publish : B1 ) Colorectal transport defecation patient spinal cord lesion By compare result scintigraphy surgery patient supraconal SCI previous result among healthy volunteer patient low SCI valuable information colorectal dysfunction SCI obtain . B2 ) Colorectal transport somato-autonomic reflex stimulation By compare localization colorectal content period 1 2 surgery 18 month detail information colorectal transport somato-autonomic reflex stimulation provide . B3 ) Colorectal empty defecation somato-autonomic reflex stimulation Substraction count period 3 registered period 2 difference colorectal empty segmental transport defecation creation reflex arch give detailed objective information effect Xiao procedure colorectal emptying .</detailed_description>
