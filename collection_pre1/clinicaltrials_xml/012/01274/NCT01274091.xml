Aim study : To test subject Pro12Pro Ala12Ala genotypes respond differentially diet supplement high saturate ( SAFA ) polyunsaturated fat ( PUFA ) . Hypotheses : 1 . Specific : Subjects Ala12Ala genotype sensitive dietary modification , therefore respond favorably PUFA diet 2 . More general : Dietary instruction individually tailor accord genotype would allow good treatment obesity diabetes</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity type 2 diabetes increase western country , include Finland . Recent genome wide analysis find &gt; 30 gene contribute either condition.. However , none gene explain &gt; 5 % disease risk altogether explain &lt; 10 % total disease risk cross-sectional study . Therefore , diet physical activity still major determinant risk , demonstrate early intervention study order find effect different dietary modification glucose lipid metabolism . More importantly , interaction gene environment , i.e . inherited response environmental change , may crucial development common disease . Unfortunately , gene-environment interaction effectively investigate intervention study expensive cross-sectional population screening . This lead low sample size reduce power detect effect minor allele . Despite limitation investigator able demonstrate gene-intervention interaction several gene , include PPARG , Finnish Diabetes Prevention study . There urgent need study investigate effect tailor diet individual select base genotype . This next essential step lead improve dietary treatment guide genetic information . The investigator first identify PPARG gene risk gene type 2 diabetes . The role Pro12Ala polymorphism diabetes risk also verify meta-analysis . However , effect seem depend intervention age . Based finding investigator create collaboration Johan Auwerx Pro12Ala animal model demonstrate differential effect dietary fat composition depend genotype . However , important conclusive proof subject select base Pro12Ala genotype would respond differently specifically tailor diet modification still need . In study effect diet high saturate fatty acid ( SAFA ) polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) compare subject carry either Pro12Pro Ala12Ala genotype PPARG gene . As primary endpoint investigator expect insulin sensitivity alter differently depend genotype . Additionally , detailed characterization energy , glucose lipid metabolism perform . Because PPARG gene play central role adipogenesis one aim study find new pathway , gene gene cluster regulate PPARG human .</detailed_description>
