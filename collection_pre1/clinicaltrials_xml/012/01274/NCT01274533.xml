	<brief_summary>This research study subject diagnose Adult T cell Leukemia/Lymphoma , rare aggressive peripheral T cell neoplasm cause virus HTLV1 . Currently , accept standard therapy disease . The purpose research study evaluate use investigational drug lenalidomide treatment Adult T cell Leukemia/Lymphoma . Lenalidomide drug alters immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Lenalidomide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) receive least 1 prior therapy . MDS MM cancer blood . It currently test variety cancer condition . In case consider experimental .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Primary Objective determine efficacy lenalidomide monotherapy relapse refractory HTLV 1 associate Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma . Efficacy assess measure response rate , tumor control rate , duration response , time progression progression free survival . The Secondary Objective evaluate safety lenalidomide monotherapy treatment subject relapse refractory HTLV 1 associate Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma .</detailed_description>
