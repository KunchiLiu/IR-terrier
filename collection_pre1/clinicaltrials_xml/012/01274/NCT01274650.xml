	<brief_summary>Patient nutritional need vary depend several factor include age , sex , height , weight , injury co-morbidities . Since injury affect energy expenditure patient , must take account assess nutritional requirement . Indirect calorimetry use measure energy expenditure patient decubitus ulcer vary degree . The primary objective study determine effect wound volume metabolic rate compare predictive equation use estimate energy requirement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Between Wound Volume Depth Decubitus Ulcers And Resting Energy Expenditure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adequate nutrition important aspect wound heal provide anabolic environment necessary tissue repair . Without proper nutrition support , heal prolong even inhibit . Provision adequate energy essential patient decubitus ulcer maximize nitrogen retention facilitate wound heal . ( 1,2 ) There publish study measure energy need patient decubitus ulcer . Spinal cord injure patient one population study utilized indirect calorimetry measure energy expenditure . Individuals spinal cord injury particularly risk develop pressure ulcer . Liu , et al . ( 3 ) measure energy expenditure 16 individual quadriplegia pressure ulcer 16 individual quadriplegia pressure ulcer . Measured energy expenditure significantly high subject quadriplegia pressure ulcer . Additionally , pressure ulcer surface area significantly correlate predicted rest energy expenditure . In study paraplegic individual , Alexander , et al . ( 4 ) find rest metabolic rate significantly high individual pressure ulcer compare paraplegia without pressure ulcer . Additional research need confirm finding . To determine nutrition requirement specific patient , energy need must estimate , take account weight , height , age , activity level well size wind patient 's co-morbidities . Although indirect calorimetry gold standard measure metabolic rate , impractical time consume use method determine need every patient . Therefore , clinician us predictive formula estimate energy need . The commonly cite guideline energy requirement heal pressure ulcer 30-35 kcal/kg ( recommendation , National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel ) . ( 1 ) The European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel also recommend minimum 30-35 kcal/kg . ( 2 ) Several equation derive predict metabolic rate base age , height , weight , sex . Two predictive equation Harris Benedict ( 5 ) Mifflin-St. Jeor . ( 6 ) These equation adjust injury factor , unclear fully account size wound patient decubiti .</detailed_description>
