	<brief_title>Ipilimumab High-Dose Interferon Alfa-2b Treating Patients With High-Risk Stage III-IV Melanoma That Has Been Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) patient randomize receive post-operative adjuvant ipilimumab give either 10 mg/kg ( high dose ipilimumab ; HIP ) 3 mg/kg ( low dose ipilimumab : LIP ) versus randomize receive high-dose interferon alfa-2b ( HDI ) utilize hierarchical design assess HIP versus HDI first LIP versus HDI second ( first comparison significant ) . II . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient randomize receive post-operative adjuvant ipilimumab give either 10 mg/kg ( HIP ) 3 mg/kg ( LIP ) versus randomize receive HDI utilize hierarchical design assess HIP versus HDI first LIP versus HDI second ( first comparison significant ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability post-operative adjuvant ipilimumab therapy give either 10 mg/kg ( HIP ) 3 mg/kg ( LIP ) . II . Among patient enrolled Clinical Community Oncology program ( CCOPs ) , compare global quality life ( QOL ) ipilimumab arm versus HDI use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT ) -General ( G ) form evaluate effect treatment-related side effect may impact health-related domain QOL use Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy ( FACIT ) -diarrhea ( D ) FACT-biological response modifier ( BRM ) .
