	<brief_summary>All subject require percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) stenting eligible participate study . Restudy coronary angiogram Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) would perform 1 5 month time stag PCI procedure ( remain coronary disease ) clinically indicate , 9 month . At time 9-month restudy ( proper time window drug elute stent develop restenosis occur ) , new disease detect restenosis treat . The reported incidence drug elute stent restenosis around 10 % simple lesion expect higher diabetic patient , long lesion multi-vessel disease ; restudy 9 month actually confers good protection patient advanced disease restenosis treat timely . All data clinical event progress monitor regular follow-up carry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The GENOUS Stent ( EPC Capturing R-stent , OrbusNeich Medical Inc. , Fort Lauderdale , FL ) commercially available extensively used standard coronary intervention procedure treat &gt; 200 patient critical coronary stenosis Queen Mary Hospital . The COMBO Stent ( OrbusNeich Medical Inc. , Fort Lauderdale , FL ) hybrid version GENOUS Stent abluminal sirolimus coating , currently investigational use clinical research REMEDEE Study ; 20 patient treat remain good condition since treatment . The GENOUS Stent bio-engineered 316L stainless steel coronary stent biocompatible circumferential coat anti-CD34 antibody , bind therefore capture circulatory endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) CD34 antigen surface . Immobilization EPCs stent surface encourage differentiation proliferation EPCs endothelial neointimal layer . Animal model demonstrate functional endothelial layer could form soon 24 48 hour GENOUS stent implantation ( 1 ) . The HEALING-FIM registry show GENOUS stent clinically safe effective treatment coronary stenosis ( 2 ) . Recent report confirm efficacy patient acute coronary syndrome require urgent revascularization ( 3,4 ) . The COMBO Stent hybrid version GENOUS Stent , additional abluminal , drug elute sirolimus coating , target reduce excessive neointima formation , maintain EPC capture capacity therefore continue promote heal stent injury . The hybrid function two technology new COMBO stent expect produce good clinical result term accelerate healing , less stent thrombosis less restenosis ; investigate current REMEDEE Study . Animal study show COMBO Stent promote endothelialization reduces neointima formation , assess optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) histopathology ( 5 ) . Even though COMBO Stents use find safe 180 patient world-wide 30 patient Queen Mary Hospital REMEDEE Study Protocol , benefit `` early '' endothelial coverage assess OCT never fully document human subject . The current EGO-COMBO study protocol design base approve protocol ongoing REMEDEE Study ( IRB : UW 09-384 ) EGO Study ( IRB : UW 10-256 ) ; still active Hospital . In multi-center REMEDEE Study , COMBO stent compare TAXUS stent ( Boston Scientific ) patient coronary artery disease require stent implantation , look 9 month late loss result . This EGO-COMBO Study different REMEDEE Study focus mainly early time frame assess degree early neointimal healing ( enhanced endothelialization ) 2nd 5th month , subsequent neointimal proliferation 9 month COMBO Stent implantation , assess high resolution frequency domain optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) use exist EGO study . This single centre , non-randomized , open-label study . Intracoronary frequency domain optical coherence tomography ( FD-OCT ) simple catheter-based imaging technique use optic fibre achieve detail assessment ( resolution 10 micron ) stent , term stent apposition , early neointimal coverage ( enhanced endothelialization ) late stent neointimal growth ( restenosis ) . It perform part routine cardiac catheterization procedure provide high-resolution cross sectional image coronary artery . OCT show safe clinical practice ( 6 , 7 ) . The LightLab C7XR OCT System ( Frequency Domain OCT ) commercially available product CE Mark FDA approval , use EGO Study . The Dragonfly OCT catheter use non-occlusive optic fibre extremely small flexible , pose absolutely additional risk patient treatment , inherent risk standard angioplasty procedure . In prospective , pilot study , OCT use image COMBO Stent implantation evaluate early healing ( stent apposition , neointimal coverage ) late lumen loss ( neo-intimal thickness neo-intimal area ) . Clinical outcome also monitor secondary end point . The OCT analyse perform USA base core laboratory , blind time frame OCT pullbacks clinical detail .</detailed_description>
