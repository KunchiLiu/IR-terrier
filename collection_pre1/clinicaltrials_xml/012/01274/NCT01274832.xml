	<brief_title>Prospective Study Compare Results STN-DBS Between Early Treated Late-treated PD Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bilateral STN DBS powerful treatment advance Parkinson disease Levodopa induce motor complication . The beneficial effect STN stimulation motor disability quality life prove . However , mean delay neurosurgery currently 14 year diagnosis , medical treatment longer control PD symptom quality life already severely impaired . Aim study prospectively assess effect bilateral STN stimulation motor sign , psychological psychiatric aspect quality life group 20 patient PD underwent surgery 5 year onset disease . These result compare group 20 patient PD history 10 year . The two group patient evaluate baseline 3 12 month DBS implant ; visit neurological motor examination assess dedicated neuropsychological psychiatric test perform . Neurosurgery may consider superior medical treatment alone even mild moderate PD 10 year duration , rather last resort advance stage disease . Thanks study could compare motor outcome cognitive aspect DBS patient short long history disease</detailed_description>
