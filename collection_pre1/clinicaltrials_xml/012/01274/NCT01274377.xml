	<brief_summary>Human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) benign infectious agent normal host , immunocompromised individual , recipient stem cell transplant , virus major cause morbidity mortality . While pharmacologic agent exist treat CMV disease , medication numerous side effect , serious myelosuppression . The frequency neutropenia range 41 % 58 % stem cell transplant ( SCT ) patient treat ganciclovir . Withdrawal anti-CMV therapy due complication may result recurrent disease . The restoration cellular immunity CMV necessary order prevent viral reactivation , generation cytotoxic T cell CMV early antigens perhaps important part host immune response CMV . At day 40 post-transplant , example , least 65 % SCT patient deficient CD8+ T-cell response CMV . Previous study demonstrate direct correlation CMV infection patient cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) function , patient defect cellular immunity high risk invasive CMV disease . The median time post-transplant development CMV disease 50 60 day , CMV re-activation occur 70 80 % CMV sero-positive SCT recipient . Without anti-viral therapy many 50 % patient develop CMV disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol evaluate safety CMV specific T cell infusion follow nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation 3-6/6 HLA match donor well evaluate efficacy antigen specific T cell infusion prevent CMV activation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects undergone nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplant , use 36/6 Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) match related donor . 2 . Subjects must CMV seropositive prior transplant CMV immune screen CMV IgG develop detectable disease PCR posttransplant setting . 3 . Performance status must Karnofsky 50100 % . 4 . Donor cellular engraftment least 2.5 % nonmyeloablative procedure prior first infusion . 5 . â‰¤ Grade 1 acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) time CMV specific T cell infusion . Patients treat acute GVHD must stable dose therapy ( increase immunosuppressive therapy 2 week plan donor cell infusion ) . The dosage level immunosuppressive therapy time infusion great 20 mg prednisone daily mycophenolate 1000 mg tid daily cyclosporine target level 200 ng/ml equivalent . 6 . At time CMV specific T cell infusion , recipient must adequate organ function indicate &lt; Grade 3 across organ system except hematologic toxicity . 7 . Subject must least 18 year age . 1 . Pregnant lactate woman , 2 . Subjects major medical psychiatric illness , treat physician feel , could seriously compromise compliance protocol . 3 . Subjects histopathologically confirm overall Grade 4 GVHD lasting longer 7 day , nonmyeloablative therapy , eligible . Donor Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 1 . Adult donor must donor use nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplant must relate family member HLA 36/6 match subject must capable provide informed consent ; Potential donor age 18 must 'single patient exemption ' approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) donor guardian must provide assent . The donor must donor use original allogeneic transplantation . Selection donor compliant 21 CFR 1271 . 2 . Adult donor must CMV seropositive prior transplant CMV immune screen CMV IgG positive . 3 . Donors complete Adult Donor History Questionnaire laboratory study include Donor Referral NTL Panel , CBC auto manual differential , Chemistry Panel within 7 day schedule collection procedure . Donors evaluate great 1 year prior transplant collection also history Physical Exam , CXR , EKG complete . Donors must medical condition would make apheresis minimal risk , normal range laboratory finding . All abnormal laboratory finding evaluate treat physician within context entire donor assessment process . 4 . Females childbearing potential negative serum betaHCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin ) test within 1 week begin apheresis .</criteria>
