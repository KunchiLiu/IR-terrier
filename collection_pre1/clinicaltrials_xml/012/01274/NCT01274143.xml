	<detailed_description>The rate adherence regular colonoscopy screening ( CS ) among member family increase risk colorectal cancer ( CRC ) far recommended level . Persons live rural area United States exhibit low CRC screen rate urban counterpart . Although detection familial predisposition cancer begin accurate family medical history , data indicate many patient receive adequate familial cancer risk assessment primary care provider . This suggest familial risk largely unrecognized may lead inadequate risk stratification , lack risk notification , appropriate risk counseling , suboptimal cancer screen preventable death . Because geographic system-level barrier , special effort need improve access personalize risk communication adherence CRC screen rural geographically underserved population increase risk CRC . In proposed study , evaluate novel telephone-based , theory-guided personalize risk communication intervention combine familial CRC risk assessment behavioral counseling tailor message . The key hypothesis guide study multifaceted personalize risk communication intervention improve CS significantly high rate mail target print intervention . Our integrative study model specifies important theoretical mechanism contribute increase use CS among person increase risk . We enroll 438 adult men woman age 30-74 consider increased risk familial CRC 2-group randomized trial . The primary aim study compare colonoscopy use among participant two group . Secondary aim compare two group regard cognitive emotional outcome explore underlie mechanisms intervention impact colonoscopy behavior . Sociodemographic , clinical , behavioral psychosocial measure collect participant baseline , 1 month , 9 month , 15 month follow intervention . Self-reported colonoscopy verify medical record . The study 's finding theoretical , well practical significance . Our finding help influence selection dissemination effective outreach approach improve CRC screen population increase risk disease . These result broad applicability understanding response personalize risk communication intervention diseases well . Findings also broaden understand underlie theoretical mechanism remote cancer risk communication lead improvement cancer screen among geographically underserved population intervention effect observe . In addition study intervention effect rural area , enroll participant urban area . These enhancement population-based randomized behavioral trial provide u unprecedented opportunity ass reach determine differential intervention effect ( i.e. , efficacy ) regard place residence ( rurality v . urbanicity . )</detailed_description>
