	<brief_summary>Arteriovenous fistula ( AVFs ) make join vein artery order get vein dilate sufficient blood flow order puncture vein clear blood waste , patient whose kidney destroy provide function . The success rate procedure vary 50-80 % depend mainly size vein , success high large vein . One vein use AVF basilic vein , locate upper arm . This vein however deeply locate necessitates movement ( transposition ) surgery less deep lateral path join artery , order use . A single study show surgery perform two part ( one enlarge vein second one relocate enlarge vein wound , new path ) successful procedure altogether . The aim study confirm finding single study mention ( one versus two stage basilic vein AVF ) , difference vein relocate outside main wound , method widely accept well .</brief_summary>
