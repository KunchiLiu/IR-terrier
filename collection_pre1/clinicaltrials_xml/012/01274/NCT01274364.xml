	<brief_title>Establishing Diabetes Registry Using JADE-DIAMOND Electronic Portal ( CN001 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes pandemic disease affect 5-10 % global population . More 60 % affected people come Asia number expect increase 85 million 2005 132 million 2010 Asia alone . On average , diabetes reduces life expectancy 10-12 year . While stroke , heart disease kidney failure account 50 % global death , 30-50 % patient condition diabetes major contribute factor . In contrast West , main increase diabetes prevalence Asia occur young middle age population . On average , 17 million people die stroke heart disease yearly basis . Of , 11 million occur Asia , affect many young parent economically active people . Despite devastating nature , many diabetic complication prevent managed effectively preserve health , reduce disability improve quality life . However , multiple barrier implementation quality diabetes care . These include insufficient knowledge base health care professional , fragmented nature health care system , lack reimbursement outpatient procedure include therapeutic patient education , poor compliance treatment part due silent nature diabetes associate complication well complex nature care protocol . The latter include periodic evaluation clinical laboratory parameter need people diabetes adhere long term medication self care . While optimal management risk factor treatment target substantially reduce risk diabetes associate complication , challenge lie effective translation evidence clinical practice . Since mid 1990s , inspire benefit structure care , make possible conduct clinical trial , CUHK Diabetes Care &amp; Research Group develop prototype structure care protocols include annual comprehensive assessment use doctor-nurse-physician assistant team . Consistent international data , prototype substantially improve rate treatment compliance attainment multiple treatment target result reduce death cardio-renal complication rate . The Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation ( JADE ) Program web-based disease management program conceptualize , develop test Asia Diabetes Foundation ( ADF ) since 2007 , support MSD educational grant . The objective JADE Program include : 1. promote collective learn share best practice diabetes base regionally relevant evidence 2. increase regional awareness magnitude diabetes preventable nature education , ongoing data collection implementation evidence-based guideline 3. establish regional diabetes registry 4. collect evidence base inform relevant stakeholder include public , people diabetes , health care professional , policy maker payors change policy practice order make quality diabetes care accessible , sustainable affordable . Using state art information technology , JADE DIAMOND electronic portal provide virtual platform enable care professional record , manage analyse large amount information collect various consultation visit . The Programs also incorporate risk equation develop validated CUHK Diabetes Care &amp; Research Group help doctor assess patient ' future event rate . This information , display chart trend line , communicate patient doctor motivate behavioral change encourage dialogue set treatment goal . Apart provide template documentation risk factor complication use standardized protocol , JADE Program also incorporate different evidence-based care protocol recommendation follow schedule care process accordance patient 's risk profile . Decision support term prompt , chart , trend line practice tip use help doctor patient make informed decision optimize care . The JADE Program also possess matrix enable care provider track clinical progress risk factor control benchmarking quality improvement purpose . On hand , DIAMOND Program provide first step entry quality assurance program establish diabetes registry clinic level . The ongoing collection data provide invaluable platform collaborative epidemiological interventional study pertinent Asian population . In multicentre study , shall use trio team consist trained doctor , nurse physician assistant ( PA ) deliver protocol-driven diabetes care use web-based disease management program , Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation ( JADE ) Program . To fully realize functionality JADE Program require change practice environment deployment additional manpower ( e.g . nurse PA ) enter data provide reminder patient doctor improve adherence protocol . In setting change may immediately possible , periodic comprehensive assessment use structured template JADE Program allow recognition risk factor complication early intervention . The latter allow data collect systematic manner form basis DIAbetes MONitoring Database ( DIAMOND ) first step towards quality assurance . After explanation train doctor nurse write informed consent , patient randomize either JADE DIAMOND Program . The former encompasses component structure care deliver trio-team doctor , nurse PA DIAMOND Program consist comprehensive assessment baseline 12-month patient manage usual manner thereafter . At end 12 month , patient undergo repeat comprehensive assessment comparison rate attainment treatment target , behavioral change , quality life default rate . Aims study : 1 . To evaluate reach , adoption acceptability JD Program patient health care team ; 2 . To compare effectiveness JADE ( structure care ) versus DIAMOND ( usual care ) Programs attainment treatment target , improvement quality life change behavior ; 3 . To document pattern complication , risk factor , use medication quality life type 2 diabetic patient Study site : 1 . Beijing People 's Hospital , Beijing 2 . Peking Union Hospital , Beijing 3 . 1st Hospital , Peking University Hospital , Beijing 4 . China-Japan Friendship Hospital , Beijing 5 . Shanghai Sixth People 's Hospital , Shanghai 6 . Third Affiliated Hospital Sun Yat-Sen University , Guangzhou</detailed_description>
