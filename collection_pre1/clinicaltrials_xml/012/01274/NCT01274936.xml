For chronic neck pain without radicular symptom , low quality evidence herbal effective placebo pain relief , measured end treatment . However , size study small effect measure short-term . Further research likely change effect size confidence result . There need trial adequate number participant address long-term efficacy effectiveness herbal medicine compare placebo .
