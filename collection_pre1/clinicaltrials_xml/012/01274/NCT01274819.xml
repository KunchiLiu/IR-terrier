	<brief_summary>Rationale : Delirium frequently encounter problem ICU patient lead increased morbidity mortality ; Delirium ICU associate sleep deprivation among others cause disrupted circadian rhythm ; Dynamic Light application aim restore proper circadian rhythm rhythmically alternate light intensity show beneficial effect sleep quality . Whether DLA improve sleep quality reduces delirium incidence ICU patient know Goals/endpoints : To evaluate feasibility dynamic light application ICU study effect dynamic light application incidence delirium , duration mechanical ventilation , number ICU hospital day , mortality mixed population medical surgical ICU patient . In subgroup patient high risk develop delirium , marker circadian rhythm , inflammation brain damage post ICU HRQoL assess Study design : prospective randomize single centre trial Study population : adult ICU patient &gt; 18 year old expect duration stay 24 hour Intervention : Patients randomize Standard Care Standard Care + DLA ; When receive standard care , normal lighting setting use patient room , control medical personnel ; In room patient randomize DLA group , DL apply change intensity day accord fix rhythm , regulate centrally . In addition necessary , intervention light use operated patient room . Study parameters/endpoints : incidence delirium measure CAM-ICU ; duration mechanical ventilation , ICU total hospital mortality ; ICU hospital LOS ; Serum level inflammatory marker marker brain damage , urinary level marker circadian rhythm , data HRQoL questionnaires total light exposure group</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN This prospective randomized , single centre trial . The propose starting date 01-july- 2011 duration study 15 month . All ICU patient expect ICU stay 24 hour potential eligible . On ICU admission , patient screen eligibility . The patient ' demographic , patient ' health status , medication use , APACHE II score , SOFA score admission diagnosis report baseline . Before recruitment enrollment study , patient and/or relative give full explanation study inform free discontinue participation study time . When consider eligible , patient give unique patient number consecutive order assign treatment correspond number . Patients randomize one-on-one fashion accord computer generate randomization list Standard Care Standard Care + DLA . The randomization list keep data co-ordination centre . All 20 patient room 2 ICU ward equip special lighting system . This light system offer standard basic light patient room , set intensity light colour , DL set offer change light condition depend time day , follow rhythmic pattern . In addition , room basic low-intensity orientation light , turn night-time room . The switch two mode regulate centrally control panel locate nursing station alter patient-room 1.1 Standard Care On admission , full physical examination perform , possible , history take . An ECG chest x-ray , perform shortly , do . In addition , blood drawn indwell arterial catheter haemoglobin , leucocyte thrombocyte count , renal liver function , electrolytes , arterial blood gas analysis , lactate marker inflammation ( C-reactive protein , procalcitonin ) . Blood pressure , heart rate , fluid balance , oxygen saturation measure continuously automatically registered Patient Data Management System ( PDMS ) . When consider necessary , ventilatory support commence continue ( post-operative patient ) additional hemodynamic measurement perform . All patient receive thromboprophylaxis , clear contraindication exist , ulcer prophylaxis . When patient intubate , receive analgesic often sedative medication patient comfort . If patient expect receive mechanical ventilation least 48 hour , Selective Digestive Decontamination ( SDD ) prophylaxis commence , consist application oral gastrointestinal antibiotic suspension , administration four day i.v . antibiotic ( cefotaxime ) surveillance culture . Twice daily 0800hrs 2000hrs , routine blood analysis consist arterial blood gas analysis , haemoglobin , leucocyte thrombocyte electrolyte , renal function marker inflammation , perform . When clear contraindication exist , sedative infusion interrupt every morning since proven decrease length mechanical ventilation ( 39 ) . In addition , consider feasible , attempt make `` wean '' patient mechanical ventilator . Protocol-guided early mobilisation commence soon possible , direct dedicated physical therapist . Level sedation monitor part daily care nurse patient every two hour use Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) . This scale divide level consciousness indicate number range -5 ( unarousable ) +4 ( combative , see Appendix ) . Ideally , patient RASS 0 ( alert calm ) sedation titrate achieve RASS -2 0 . In addition , screen presence delirium do use CAM-ICU every eight hour well trained ICU nurse . As mentioned , method validate use ICU patient easy use non-psychiatric personnel . When CAM-ICU positive , delirium treatment start accord protocol ( see Appendix ) . Standard measure prevent delirium among patient include maintain proper day-and- night rhythm promote night-time sleep ( reduction light noise disturbance reduction daytime sleep use daily activity program mobilisation . When patient visual auditive impairment , glass hear aid use much possible . A clock present ICU room relative ask bring photograph patient sense familiarity . Dosages deliriogenic medication ( anticholinergic , opiate , benzodiazepine ) reduce much possible however rule completely since benzodiazepine opiate often use sedation analgesia . When patient randomize receive basic light set , standard lighting use , include possibility use high intensity intervention light perform intervention . The light switch room offer three option : 1 ) main light 2 ) main light 3 ) intervention light on/off . 1.2 Standard Care + DLA In addition standard care , inpatient randomize receive DLA , light switch room set DLA , soon possible patient instal initial investigation handling ( e.g . place urinary catheter , central venous line and/or arterial cannula ) perform . When intervention necessary , high intensity intervention light turn manually physicians nurse . The lighting operation panel room offer one option , i.e . intervention light on/off . A computer log use dynamic lighting system , 1.3 Assessment During first 24 hour , risk develop delirium assess use validate PRE-DELIRIC score . When patient risk develop delirium â‰¥ &gt; 40 % , define high risk patient . In patient , presence delirium assess three time day death discharge ICU death fix time use CAM-ICU . When patient unconscious , either illness due sedative medication , CAM-ICU perform delirium assess . This record case-record form . Since delirium associate use sedative opioids , 24-hour dosage medication record daily 8 . For list medication , see appendix . In addition , renal function , ( plasma creatinine urea ) , electrolytes ( sodium , potassium , ionized calcium ) haemoglobin , white blood cell count , procalcitonin ) monitor daily discharge ICU . Total hospital length stay register patient . Patients analyze intention-to-treat principle . To assess difference light exposure two group , light level measure every patient room , close patient 's head . Since daylight may also influence total light exposure difference exist daylight exposure different patient room ( See appendix 3 ) difference light exposure different room analyse associated primary endpoint . In patient high risk develop delirium 5 ml blood draw day 1,3,5,7 , 14,21 28 store -80 degree Celsius analysis . In addition high risk patient , circadian rhythm derive biomarkers determine mean urinary excretion collect 3-hour urinary sample 24 hour day 7 , 14,21 , 28 per 2 week . To determine pre-existent quality life validate Health Related Quality Life questionnaire use . 1.4 randomisation , blind allocation treatment Patients randomize one-on one fashion accord computer generate randomization list . The randomization list keep data co-ordination centre . Since blind impossible dynamic light , patient relative , nurse doctor aware treatment arm . 1.5 Study procedure DLA apply DLA group . In patient 5 ml blood drawn within 24 hour admission store . In high risk patient , extra 5 ml blood collect morning laboratory round day 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 14 , 21 28 . Since patient indwell arterial line blood already collect consider additional burden patient . In total maximum ca . 35 millilitre blood period 28 day collect . In addition high risk patient , 3 -hour urinary sample collect 24 hour day 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 every week discharge ICU . On ICU , patient indwell urinary catheter . On admission , validate QoL questionnaire hand patient his/her next kin determine pre-existent QoL ; 3 , 6 12 month QoL questionnaire send patient determine post ICU QoL . Analysis perform whole group also post-hoc analysis effect DLA analyse per season admission .</detailed_description>
