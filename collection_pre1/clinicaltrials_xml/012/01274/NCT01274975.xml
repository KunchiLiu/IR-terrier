	<detailed_description>Adipose derive mesenchymal stem cell ( AdMSCs ) represent attractive ethical cell source stem cell therapy . With recent demonstration MSC homing property , intravenous aplications MSCs cell-damaged disease increase . In human clinical trial , eight male patient suffer spinal cord injury intravenously administer autologous hAdMSCs ( 4×10e8 cell ) one time .</detailed_description>
