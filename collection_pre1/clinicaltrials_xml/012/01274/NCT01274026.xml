	<brief_summary>This study seek establish evidence : 1. physiologic change , unrelated effect PAH enzyme , occur PKU patient treat Kuvan® therapy , 2. change may cause enhanced neurotransmitter synthesis brain upregulation gene expression ( increase ability gene produce functional enzyme ) , 3. beneficial change behavior cognition , especially executive function skill may result . The objective study correlate change behavior executive function skill PKU patient non-responsive sapropterin effect PAH enzyme , define lower blood PHE level , urine neurotransmitter level broad gene expression prior sapropterin administration . Expected outcomes would include evidence sapropterin effect upregulation enzymes PAH control neurotransmitter synthesis , result correlation behavioral cognitive change . The investigator hope study inform detailed investigation biochemical molecular action sapropterin ( Kuvan® ) lead increase understanding possible treatment effect beyond lower blood PHE response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study participant population include approximately 30 establish PKU patient receive care Hayward Genetics Center , find previously exhibit decrease blood PHE level ( nonresponders ) administration sapropterin . Subjects act control . Primary endpoint measurement behavioral cognitive function , neurotransmitter level , gene expression enzyme activity 4 week treatment compare baseline level . At study baseline patient attend approximately 1 hour clinic visit usual genetics clinic location . Study purpose , design , requirement discuss , consents/assents review sign . Rating inventory executive function performance behavior ( BASC-2 BRIEF tool ) administer patient parent PI and/or Study Coordinator . Urine sample collect non-invasively measurement neurotransmitter level . Blood collected venipuncture ( 3-5 ml ) microarray expression analysis analysis plasma amino acid . 3-day food record previously provide participant completion collect . Participants provide 4 week supply Kuvan® instruction take medication study period . The importance maintain usual dietary intake ( food choice metabolic formula ) minimize research effect attributable sapropterin administration emphasize . Sapropterin discontinue end 4 week study period . All measure repeat site study participant end week 4 study period . At ends week 1 2 additional blood sample send Hayward Genetics Center measurement PHE TYR level ascertain significant change occur patient 's usuual dietary intake . These sample draw patient 's local state health unit , do usual monitoring . Nutrient analysis 3-day food diary conduct Hayward Genetics Center . 1 . Behavior executive function assess use publish validated inventory age 2-21 year , complete patient self-reports parent ( guardian ) report appropriate . Instruments use Behavioral Assessment System Children ( BASC-2 ) parental Rating Scale Self-Reporting Personality Rating Scale , Behavioral Rating Inventory Executive Function ( BRIEF ) Parent Form Instruments Executive Function . Completed inventory score use electronic evaluation instrument Study Coordinator PI , consultation Harvard Medical Center expert need . 2 . Urine sample non-invasively collect sent analysis catechols neurotransmitter NIH laboratory specialize technique . Samples blind prevent bias . 3 . Microarray analysis blood sample conduct Hayward Genetics Molecular Laboratory determine effect gene expression , thus enzyme activity , result sapropterin administration . 4 . Plasma amino acid analyze Hayward Genetics Biochemical Laboratory document patient `` nonresponsive '' sapropterin ( resultant lower blood PHE ) ; monitor change plasma amino acid could indicate patient 's failure maintain usual dietary restriction 5 . 3-day food diary complete patient ( parent/guardians ) home document substantive change usual dietary intake study period . These analyzed Hayward Genetics Center use MetabolicPro web-based analysis program .</detailed_description>
