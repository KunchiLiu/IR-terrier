	<brief_title>Evaluation 18F FMH3 PET Marker Histamine-3 Receptor Activity Subjects With AD Compared w/ HC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 10 subject Alzheimer disease ( AD ) 8 healthy control ( HC ) subject recruit participate study . All subject undergo write informed consent screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation baseline cognitive evaluation . Subjects ask undergo bolus injection [ 18F ] -FMH3 . Subjects undergo serial PET imaging scan plasma sample measurement [ 18F ] -FMH3 plasma ( protein bound free ) period 8 hour . The primary imaging outcome measure brain regional distribution volume express brain tissue plasma ratio radioligand , [ 18F ] -FMH3 . At least 2 week follow initial image visit , subject may ask return second injection scan procedure evaluate reproducibility image measure use procedure . Subjects may decline participate second scan .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The following criterion meet inclusion AD subject study : The participant 50 year old . Written inform consent obtain . Participants clinical diagnosis probable Alzheimer disease accordance DSMIVTR accord ( NINCDS/ADRDA ) criterion . Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score ≤ 2 . Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale score ≤ 4 . Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) ≤ 10 . For female , nonchild bear potential negative urine blood pregnancy test day [ 18F ] FMH3 injection . The following criterion meet inclusion healthy control subject study : The participant 18 year old . Written inform consent obtain . Negative history neurological psychiatric illness base evaluation research physician . Clinical Dementia Rating score = 0 . For female , nonchild bear potential negative urine blood pregnancy test day [ 18F ] FMH3 injection . Alzheimer 's subject exclude participation follow reason : The subject clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical psychiatric illness The subject disorder may interfere drug absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion . The subject evidence clinically significant gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , hematological , neoplastic , endocrine , neurological , immunodeficiency , pulmonary , disorder disease . Healthy control subject exclude participation follow reason : The subject clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical psychiatric illness . The subject evidence clinically significant gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , hematological , neoplastic , endocrine , neurological , immunodeficiency , pulmonary , disorder disease . The subject disorder may interfere drug absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion . The subject contraindication MRI examination , e.g . metal implant phobia determine onsite radiologist perform scan .</criteria>
