	<detailed_description>The adipocyte hormone , leptin , show restore health glucoregulation near-death , insulin deficient diabetic rodent . This make leptin hormone , since discovery insulin 1922 , capability . Leptin normalizes hyperglucagonemia diabetes reduce lipogenesis cholesterologenenesis . Treatment diabetic rodent combination leptin insulin , lead stable pattern glucose control reduce insulin requirement , oppose high glucose variability characterize treatment type 1 diabetes supraphysiologic dos insulin alone . As , initiate pilot clinical trial test combination leptin insulin therapy type 1 diabetes . Fifteen leptin sensitive patient ( body mass index &lt; 27 kg/m² ) uncontrolled diabetes ( HbA1c 7.0 10.0 % ) treat slightly supraphysiologic dos recombinant human leptin ( Amylin Pharmaceuticals ) . Subjects compare treatment leptin . Endpoint variable include HbA1c , change daily insulin dose , mean standard deviation blood glucose inpatient glucose monitoring glucose meter download . We also assess effect leptin therapy energy intake assess 3-day food record body weight fat DEXA . Intramyocellular intrahepatic lipid concentration 1H-MRS assess 3 month metreleptin therapy . A satiety analysis employ . In addition , plasma hormone inflammatory biomarkers assay course study .</detailed_description>
