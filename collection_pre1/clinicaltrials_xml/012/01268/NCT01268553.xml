	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess tolerability clinical effect transition intravenous ( IV , needle vein ) subcutaneous ( SQ , needle skin ) recently-approved inhaled treprostinil ( Tyvaso ) treatment pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . Our hypothesis transition inhale treprostinil tolerated patient . The intravenous subcutaneous drug epoprostenol treprostinil receive approval treatment PAH many year ago . While medication improve exercise capacity symptom PAH , give injection thus several side effect , pain catheter infection . This result many patient either refuse take medication quit medication tolerate . The form prostacyclin treatment available PAH patient inhale . There 2 inhaled prostacyclins approve PAH , however one require least 6 inhalation per day , every day , take 30 minute inhale time . Thus , regularly-used medication issue surround compliance make risky drug use patient get full dos every day . The inhaled medication , treprostinil , approve month ago , need give 4 time day , take 2-3 minute inhale . Since inhaled treprostinil administer easily , anticipate many patient transition epoprostenol treprostinil recently approve inhaled treprostinil , however know safe effective way manage patient . Thus , goal prospective study gather observational data regard switch make , tolerability switch , , extent possible methodology , assess clinical effect switch . This prospective study . Twenty patient &gt; 18 year old PAH enrol . Patients enrol clinical decision convert either IV epoprostenol , IV treprostinil , SQ treprostinil inhale treprostinil therapy make . This usually result patient ask switch inhale therapy , allow physician feel switch would safe . If eligible , informed consent , patient history physical examination , 6 min walk test , cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) , blood test , symptom questionnaire fill . Patients admit hospital monitoring catheter place inside patient 's heart inhale treprostinil initiate , dose IV/SQ medication reduce 24-26 hour . Clinical follow-up week 1 , 4 , 12 . The procedure part routine clinical care patient would receive transition inhaled therapy , include hospitalization catheterization . The criterion able switch conservative . Pressure heart lung must low ( mPAP &lt; 40 mmHg RAP &lt; 12 mmHg catheterization ) , dose IV SQ medication must low ( &lt; 20 ng/kg/min ) . Regarding patient subset enrol study clinical decision convert transition therapy make , try ensure clinical decision-making influence need enroll subject study explicitly note potential conflict interest patient ( addressed ICF ) . We make clinical decision patient base desire fill study number , every make avoid potential perceived conflict interest .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose This study propose investigate safety , tolerability , feasibility transition patient PAH intravenous subcutaneous prostacyclin analog inhale treprostinil use define protocol . Twenty-one patient three PH specialty referral center enrol 12-week , prospective , open-label study . If subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion , switch intravenous subcutaneous prostacyclin analog inhale treprostinil accord defined transition protocol . Background Parenteral prostacyclin analog improve exercise capacity survival patient pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , however practical issue limit tolerability patient . The prostacyclin analogue treprostinil show improve exercise capacity signs/symptoms PAH , deliver via four 2-3 minute inhalation period per day . In addition , extensive worldwide experience subcutaneous intravenous form treprostinil , document safety , efficacy , tolerability . Prior publish study examine feasibility prostacyclin transition , include transition intravenous epoprostenol non-parenteral PAH treatment , subcutaneous intravenous treprostinil , intravenous prostanoids subcutaneous treprostinil . There currently publish experience examine safety , tolerability feasibility transition patient parenteral prostanoids inhale treprostinil .</detailed_description>
