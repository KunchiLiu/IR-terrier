	<brief_title>Comparison Between Two Different Technique Treatment Chronic Pilonidal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The author prospectively study patient sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease ( SPD ) Mansoura University Hospital , Mansoura , Egypt , .Patients randomly assign undergo either Limberg rhomboid flap Karydakis flap reconstruction . The follow-up period range 8 month two year , mean follow-up period 18 month . Surgical finding , complication , recurrence rate degree patient satisfaction compare . This randomize control study evaluate rhomboid excision limberg flap closure versus Karydakis flap treatment chronic pilonidal disease . Karydakis flap reconstruction perform conformity original procedure describe Karydakis . The technique consist vertical eccentric elliptical incision carry post sacral fascia , complete removal unhealthy tissue normal tissue around cyst sinus tract , mobilization medial wound edge undercut adipose tissue depth 1 cm , advancement flap across midline post sacral fascia suture edge lateral one . Lamberg flap technique : area excise mapped skin rhomboid form . The skin incision deepen presacral fascia centrally gluteal fascia laterally . After remove specimen , Limberg fasciocutaneous flap prepare extend incision right gluteus maximus fascia ( Fig3a ) . The size prepared flap equal rhomboid area . Meticulous hemostasis accomplish electrocauterization . The fasciocutaneous flap transpose medially defect would cover without tension . Sutures place gluteus fascia flap presacral fascia 2/0 polyglactin prevent dead space</detailed_description>
