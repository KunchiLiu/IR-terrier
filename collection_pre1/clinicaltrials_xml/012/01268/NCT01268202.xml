	<brief_summary>Molecular mechanism involve radio-induced fibrosis assess UPRES EA 27-10 since 10 year . Besides canonical TGFbeta/ Smad pathway involve radio-induced fibrosis ( RIF ) , Rho/ROCK/CTGF cascade show also implicate molecular mechanism RIF . Curative administration Pravastatin ROCK specific inhibitor inhibit chronically activate Rho/ROCK/CTGF pathway vitro human cell line ex vivo human sample . In addition , curative administration Pravastatin improve establish RIF vivo . The investigator data suggest pravastatin-based strategy efficient safe antifibrotic therapy , easily transferable clinic improve quality life long-term cancer survivor without interfere prior anticancer treatment . This clinical trial evaluate curative efficacy Pravastatine patient present cutaneous and/ subcutaneous fibrosis ( grade &gt; = 2 accord NCI-CTCAE v4 toxicity scale ) treat radiotherapy head neck cancer . Patients treat Pravastatin 12 month . An intermediate evaluation efficacy ultrasound assess 6 month last , end treatment . Patients assessment perform 6 12 month end treatment look potential rebound effect . Objective ( ) clinical study Main objective : To assess Pravastatin efficacy establish cutaneous subcutaneous radio-induced fibrosis reveal 6 24 month head neck radiotherapy . Second objective : To evaluate radio-induced fibrosis regression year follow treatment stop .</brief_summary>
