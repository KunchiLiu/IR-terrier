	<brief_summary>The current approve treatment Fabry disease enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) . There actually 2 product therapeutic class available : Replagal® ( agalsidase alfa ) Fabrazyme® ( agalsidase beta ) . Both indicated long-term treatment patient confirm diagnosis Fabry disease ( alfa-galactosidase A deficiency ) . Both commercially available Europe almost 10 year , yet little information available clinical safety profile patient switch one therapy . An extended shortage Fabrazyme® begin June 2009 necessitate large number patient switch Fabrazyme® Replagal® . This offer possibility study clinical status adverse event patient switch Fabrazyme® Replagal® large-scale basis . In addition , result increase Fabrazyme® shortage , many patient receive reduced dosage Fabrazyme® extend period transition treatment Replagal® .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Safety Switch Between Agalsidase Beta Agalsidase Alfa Enzyme Replacement Patients With Anderson-Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : Anderson-Fabry disease X-linked lysosomal storage disorder result deficiency hydrolytic enzyme alfa galactosidase A . Trials specific therapy replacement alfa galactosidase A commenced 1999 subsequently two preparation alfa galactosidase A received marketing approval EMEA 2001 . Clinical trial , observational study registry data provide evidence efficacy enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) alfa galactosidase A improving symptom pain , gastrointestinal disturbance , hypohidrosis , leave ventricular mass index , glomerular filtration rate quality life men . There currently long-term data show impact enzyme replacement therapy overall survival . It suggest earlier therapy , onset end organ manifestation , would likely prevent damage therefore big effect overall survival . There yet little evidence substantiate hypothesis however clinical trial recently demonstrate safety therapeutic effect enzyme replacement child . So far , limited data available clinical course disease adverse event patient , switch one therapeutic alternative . West Lemoine ( 16 ) report clinical effect switch Agalsidase beta agalsidase alfa 5 patient Fabry disease due shortage agalsidase beta . The patient treat Replagal® 44 week average .</detailed_description>
