	<brief_title>Comparison Hemostatic Matrix Bipolar Coagulation Surgical Treatment Endometriomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometriosis define existence endometrial tissue outside uterine cavity . Ovaries common effect site disease cause endometriotic cyst ovary . The treatment endometriomas still highly controversial . It well know ovarian reserve compromise result endometriomas . Even though variety medical agent use treat endometriomas , endometriomas cause pelvic pain infertility especially &gt; 4cm size , surgical treatment offer . Even though standard surgical treatment removal cyst wall usually prefer method . Aspiration cyst fluid coagulation cyst wall practice , however associate recurrence . Nevertheless , impact surgical treatment ovarian reserve clarify . There mainly two type ovarian injury surgical removal endometriomas . First , risk healthy ovarian tissue remove along cyst wall . Second , risk thermal injury occur cyst removal hemostasis electrocoagulation . By context , investigate alternative method electrocautery cause less thermal injury ovary would open new strategy treatment infertile patient endometrioma . A new method `` hemostatic matrix '' develop provide hemostasis . Endometriomas treat without thermal injury healthy ovarian tissue use method compare bipolar coagulation . In literature , control randomize study compare hemostatic matrix bipolar coagulation impact ovarian reserve treatment ovarian endometriomas . There two main principle treat endometriomas . First , recurrence occur , second minimal ovarian injury . On background philosophy , hypothesize hemostatic matrix cause less damage ovarian tissue compare classical bipolar coagulation .</detailed_description>
