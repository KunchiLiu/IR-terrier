	<brief_title>Pharmacodynamic Study CK-2017357 Patients With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase II , double-blind , randomize , three-way crossover , placebo-controlled , PD study CK-2017357 patient generalize MG standard therapy . 36 78 patient randomize approximately 15 study center one six different treatment sequence . Each treatment sequence consist three dose period patient receive single oral dos placebo , 250 mg , 500 mg CK-2017357 . All six treatment sequence enroll 6 patient . A wash period least 7 day ( maximum 10 day ) employ individual dos patient . This study design assess effect CK-2017357 measure muscle strength , muscle fatigue pulmonary function utilize standardized Quantitative MG ( QMG ) score Manual Muscle Test ( MMT ) . The pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) relationship CK-2017357 two single dos assess versus placebo , CK-2017357 concentration versus time data obtain study may use develop population PK model estimate intra- inter-patient variability PK parameter patient MG .</detailed_description>
