	<brief_summary>The rationale phase II trial neoadjuvant fix dose rate gemcitabine plus capecitabine patient LAPC include following : First , obtain sufficient tumor down-staging procure R0/R1 resection , report one significant prognostic factor survival ; second , provide observation period exclude surgery patient rapidly progressive disease help select patient surgery great likelihood favorable postoperative outcome ; third , eliminate micrometastatic disease , likely present patient , earlier adjuvant set prevent post-surgical growth spurt ; fourth , adjuvant therapy give neoadjuvant set well tolerate , patient recently undergone major operation ; last , lack widely accept optimal preoperative palliative approach patient LAPC , majority may operate . The primary goal determine R0 resection rate neoadjuvant fix dose rate ( FDR ) gemcitabine-capecitabine combination chemotherapy patient borderline resectable unresectable locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma . The secondary goal assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) OS ( overall survival ) patient assess adverse event neoadjuvant treatment .</brief_summary>
