	<brief_summary>To evaluate efficacy fix dose Azilect® ( 1 mg/day ) v placebo assess change baseline mean total daily OFF time 18 week treatment levodopa-treated Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) patient motor fluctuation Korea .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Azilect® ( Rasagiline ) Levodopa-treated Parkinson 's Disease Patients With Motor Fluctuations Korea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levodopa mainstay therapy PD decade , consider one effective medication relief symptom PD . However , within month year majority levodopa-treated patient notice decline duration benefit dose develop motor-complications . A major problem appearance fluctuation mobility , cycle ON OFF period . The administration Azilect® , monoamine oxidase type B ( MAO-B ) inhibitor , slow elimination endogenous dopamine supply dopamine produce exogenous levodopa therapy may therefore improve ON-OFF fluctuation . Azilect® approve treatment PD Europe US . The objective study evaluate efficacy , tolerability , safety Azilect® compare placebo Korean PD patient motor fluctuation levodopa therapy .</detailed_description>
