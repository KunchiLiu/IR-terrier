	<brief_summary>Purpose To try establish whether lid-parallel conjunctival fold ( LIPCOF ) influence increase lubrication rewetting lubricate eyedrop contain hydroxypropyl-guar , proven lubricate effect . Methods During summer fall 2009 , 16 ophthalmologist various region Croatia investigate effect topical therapy lubricate eyedrop sign symptom dry eye , special emphasis lid-parallel conjunctival fold ( LIPCOF ) . 229 patient enrol study . Results After 14 day therapy lubricate eyedrop contain hydroxypropyl-guar , statistically significant reduction LIPCOF grade observe , well reduction symptom sign dysfunctional tear syndrome ( TBUT , Schirmer test , conjunctival hyperemia ) . Conclusion Results study show positive influence lubricate eyedrop contain hydroxypropyl-guar sign symptom dysfunctional tear syndrome even 14 day treatment . It particular interest LIPCOF grade statistically significantly decrease , point increase friction decrease ocular surface lubrication possible cause appearance . Having mind , every clinician involve dysfunctional tear syndrome treatment must also think lubrication integral part treat condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ruprecht et al . ( 1976-78 ) among first ask general population simple question : `` gritty sensation eye ? '' . The result show age group 55-59 , 22,8 % female 9,9 % male report symptom . In age group 45-54 year , almost 20 % female 15 % male also dry eye sign . Based report symptom , Schirmer test , TBUT test Rose Bengal Staining , Jacobssson et al . survey among 780 subject belong general population Sweden find prevalence dry eye age group 55-72 year 15 % . In recent study Hikichi et al . Japan , screen 2127 patient eight medical center , dry eye symptom find among 17 % . No seasonal fluctuation observe . Survey 504 subject age 30-60 Kopenhagen reveal prevalence dry eye 11 % . In large study Maryland , USA , involve 2520 resident old 65 , 15 % report one dry eye symptom , 2.2 % also pathological Schirmer test . Mentioned study show dry eye symptom prevalent age group old 50 , although correlation find age gender . McCarthy et al . analyzed prevalence dry eye Melbourne ( Australia ) . 926 participant old 40 enrol survey . Dry eye diagnose 10.8 % subject Rose Bengal staining , 16.3 % Schirmer test , 8.6 % TBUT test , 1.5 % fluorescein staining , 7.4 subject use two test , 5.5 % subject extreme symptom dry eye unrelated hay fever . Women report dry eye symptom frequently men . Canadian Dry Eye Epidemiology Study ( CANDEES ) try establish prevalence dry eye Canada . Questionnaires mail every optometrist Canada , ask hand 30 consecutive patient . The total 13.517 complete questionnaire return ( 15.6 % sent ) . All age group enrol study . 55 % subject age group 21-50 , 60.7 % woman , 24.3 % wore contact lens . Dry eye symptom report 28.7 % survey subject . When ask describe severity symptom , 7.6 % report moderate constant symptom , 1.6 % describe severe . It interesting note vast majority subject report severe symptom woman ( ratio woman men : 46:1 ) . Regarding gender , 33 % woman 22 % men report dry eye symptom . Salisbury Study ( 1997 ) find dry eye symptom 59 % survey subject . In Beaver Dam Eye Study ( 2000 ) 14,4 % 3703 surveyed subject dry eye symptoms11 . Part study analyze possible association dry eye symptom parameter . Statistically significant independent association find dry eye symptom arthritis , smoking , coffee drinking , hyperthyreosis , goiter , diabetes take multivitamin food supplement . When analyze cause first visit general outpatient office Zagreb University Hospital Eye Department , 6.3 % patient report dysfunctional tear syndrome symptom primary cause visit . That percentage rise 48 % patient external eye disease symptom analyze , would doubt even high chronic external eye inflammatory condition count . Group author lead Prof.Hoeh 1995 publish paper Lid-parallel conjunctival fold sure diagnostic sign dry eye . The method describe name Lidkantenparallelen Konjunktivalen Falten , Lid Parallel Conjunctival Folds ( LIPCOF ) . It present useful innovative way diagnose dry eye . However , till mention relatively publish paper rarely use everyday clinical practice , especially outside Europe , frequently term conjunctivochalasis associate dry eye . According author , height and/or number bulbar conjunctival fold parallel temporal margin lower eyelid observe . Before assessment , low eyelid briefly lift eye surface- fold disappear , indeed describe LIPCOF . Findings rank follow : Grade 0 : folds- normal finding ( dry eye ) Grade 1 : one fold normal tear meniscus height- mild dry eye Grade 2 : multiple fold height normal tear meniscus- moderately dry eye Grade 3 : multiple fold normal tear meniscus height- severe dry eye Authors claim LIPCOF 93 % positive predictive value . In word , detects dry eye 93 % certainty . Its negative predictive value claim 76 % . Furthermore , LIPCOF invasive , take short time perform additional cost , require use test strip , dye etc . Despite mentioned advantage method , still know actually measures- proven correlation conjunctival fold sign symptom dry eye automatically point reason appearance . One possible cause LIPCOF may decrease lubrication increase friction ocular surface eyelid blink dysfunctional tear syndrome . The importance friction upper eyelid ocular surface well describe Korb Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy concept . Nowadays , disposal commercially available rewetting eyedrop , due formulation , display proven lubricate effect well . If application reduces LIPCOF grade , increase friction may cause appearance fold . Furthermore , find may show sign dysfunctional tear syndrome may influence appropriate therapy . The aim study try establish whether LIPCOF influence increase lubrication rewetting lubricate eyedrop contain hydroxypropyl-guar proven lubricate effect . Should case , may conclude conjunctival fold appear due increase friction , dynamic condition , reversible appropriate therapy . The influence lubrication sign symptom dry eye also observe .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ocular foreign body sensation , burn stinging , complaint pronounce winter , windy condition , computer work , bilateral , duration longer three month , visual acuity fluctuation depend blinking longer read computer work , tear cold weather , morning , longer read computer work . Patients also ask whether symptom pronounce morning evening . The main enrollment criterion score list symptom 15 high . Pregnant woman , child , chronic eye patient continuous topical therapy previous month ( i.e.glaucoma ) patient suffer acute eye disease therefore topical systemic therapy previous month exclude study .</criteria>
