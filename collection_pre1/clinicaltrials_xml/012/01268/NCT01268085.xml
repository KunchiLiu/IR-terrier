	<detailed_description>Ever since 1979 Nobel Prize award Cormack Hounsfield development computer assist tomography ( CAT scan , technology revolutionize practice medicine . CAT scan combine special x-ray equipment sophisticated computer produce image inside body . They widely use , noninvasive medical test help physician diagnose treat numerous medical condition . In 2000 , U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) Conference Radiation Control Program Directors ( CRCPD ) estimate approximately 40 million CAT scan perform annually . In recent year , multiple article highlight increase risk develop cancer ionize radiation . The risk increase high radiation dos , accumulates repeat scan . The 2007 American College Radiology 's white paper radiation dose medicine Amis , et al. , emphasize importance address issue , propose plan educate stakeholder principle radiation safety appropriate utilization image . In addition , 2007 Society Pediatric Radiology join force American College Radiology several medical society form Alliance Radiation Safety Pediatric Imaging ( Image Gently Alliance ) . The charge Alliance summarize mission statement : `` â€¦to raise awareness image community need adjust radiation dose image child . '' Hospitals computerize physician order entry system ( CPOE ) unique opportunity use decision support radiation safety influence physician 's ordering practice real-time . CPOE decision support technology successfully use positively effect physician order behavior improve patient safety many aspect patient care , include order radiology test . An ideal decision support tool radiation safety educate physician danger cumulative ionizing radiation , present patient 's image history , guide provider best modality meet patient 's diagnostic need little radiation exposure possible . The design challenge create decision support tool appropriately protect patient overutilization CAT scan , without inadvertently lead underutilization CAT scan inappropriate utilization alternative test . This research protocol propose study one design large , academic medical center .</detailed_description>
