	<brief_summary>Postoperative hypersensitivity ( POH ) problem many patient determine recent Practitioners Engaged Applied Research Learning ( PEARL ) study POH follow occlusal caries restoration . The objective two-armed randomized comparative effectiveness research trial ( RCERT ) determine whether add resin modify glass ionomer liner ( RMGI ) reduce POH dentin bond Class I resin base composite ( RBC ) restoration , identify factor ( putative risk factor ) associate increased POH . The primary outcome study reduction/elimination restoration POH measure clinical assessment ( air stream ) patient-reports . Outcomes ascertained via follow specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : To compare reduction hypersensitivity study teeth clinical measurement ( air dry ) patient-reported outcome among two treatment group three point time : prior restoration one four week postrestoration . Specific Aim 2 : To identify putative risk factor POH ( factor associate difference POH ) include : preoperative caries stage measure proposed American Dental Association ( ADA ) Caries Classification System ( CCS ) , lesion depth measure preoperative radiograph , dentin caries activity rank opening lesion , preparation depth , patient sleep bruxism status .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Presence solely adult dentition age 15 60 ( The upper age 60 year select since pulp space limit POH less likely age ) . 2 . Presence one permanent posterior teeth ( different quadrant , third molar exclude ) clinical diagnosis new Class I caries extend dentin without radiographic confirmation . Up 4 teeth ( one per quadrant ) may enrol . If one occlusal lesion quadrant meet inclusion criterion patient eligible inclusion study . Only one tooth per quadrant treat 4 week study . 3 . Lesion depth , visible radiograph , must ≤1/2 distance DentoEnamel Junction ( DEJ ) pulp radiograph 9 month old . 4 . The tooth must occlusion natural tooth . 5 . A resinbased composite restoration would standard care lesion . 6 . The tooth must free evidence pulpitis ( report linger pain associated stimulus ) . 7 . Subjects must available contact least four week posttreatment . 8 . Subjects willing able understand sign IRBapproved inform consent form individual age 18 , parental / guardian assent form . 9 . Subject 's baseline score NPAS must ≥3 air and/or cold stimulation exhibit pain last approximately four second know `` linger pain '' 10 . Gingival Index less equal 2 . 1 . Individuals second molar fully erupt . 2 . Teeth mobility 2 great , inflamed gingival tissue . 3 . Existing restoration ( ) tooth . 4 . Teeth clinically assess fracture . 5 . Tooth abutment removable partial denture . 6 . Tooth subgingival calculus , unless remove treatment visit . 7 . Subjects undergo active orthodontic treatment . Use retainer allow . 8 . Subjects currently enrol complete past month tooth bleach program . 9 . Subjects prior reaction inability tolerate dental product use , severe topical hypersensitivity reaction . 10 . Subjects treatment medical disorder include : dementia , Parkinson 's disease , severe depression , severe anxiety , medical condition , opinion PI , would affect subject 's judgment postoperative hypersensitivity ability understand inform consent process . 11 . Subjects another ongoing dental research study .</criteria>
