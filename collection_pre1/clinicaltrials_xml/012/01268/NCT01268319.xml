	<brief_summary>The CANARY ( Coronary Assessment Near-infrared Atherosclerotic Rupture-prone Yellow ) Study pivotal trial evaluate criterion define Lipid Core Plaque ( LCP ) high risk rupture standard care therapy cause intra-procedural complication . If plaque require treatment high normal risk cause intra-procedural complication , life threatening , treat physician well inform may opt take precautionary measure mitigate risk result complication . The CANARY Study also design evaluate feasibility use distal embolization protection device ( EPD ) mean prevent heart attack trigger embolization plaque standard care therapy . It think EPD prevent plaque go downstream treatment obstruct heart vessel . These obstruction could cause heart attack prevent blood reach heart muscle tissue .</brief_summary>

Subject undergo PCI single lesion single native coronary artery enrollment procedure . There prior intent treat target lesion part patient 's clinical care . The target lesion angiographic stenosis visually estimate &gt; =50 % &lt; 100 % The target lesion reference vessel diameter must &gt; =2.5mm ( visually estimate ) Total target lesion length must ≤60 mm ( visually estimate ) The minimum landing zone requirement FilterWire device meet . There must major side branch ( &gt; 2.0 mm diameter ) within target lesion . There must major side branch ( &gt; 2.0mm diameter ) target lesion filter nitinol loop land zone .
