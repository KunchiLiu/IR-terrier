	<brief_summary>The coronary bifurcation lesion pose therapeutic problem high rate periprocedural complication , high rate in-stent restenosis stent thrombosis . These lesion stenting superior comparison balloon angioplasty regard side branch . It demonstrate many time , literature daily practice , angiographically high grade ostial side branch stenosis flow limit cause ischemia , therefore require treatment . From side , data MRI bifurcation PCI demonstrate occurrence angiographic stenosis 70 % diameter associate periprocedural myonecrosis region side branch . This fact put important question mechanism myonecrosis . If jailed side branch significant flow limit stenosis , degree residual ischemia , period persistence could lead myonecrosis , mean aggressive treatment ostial stenosis need . It interesting strategy treatment important , techniques second stent implantation ( primary purpose limit SB ischemia ) associate high grade troponin increase . Of course association causality , despite randomize study ( NORDIC I ) confirm also . It without explanation fact rare occurrence significant ( flow limiting , FFR &lt; .75 ) stenosis appearance ( le 40 % side branch ostial stenosis 75 % ) almost 50 % periprocedural myonecrosis detect side branch area . One work hypothesis stent implantation relate episode ischemia induces prolong vasospasm , result prolonged ischemia . Thus , ostial stenosis could non-significant estimate registered FFR , microcirculatory lever ischemia could persist small area available flow sufficient despite global regional flow deem sufficient . It also possible patient enough recruitable collateral . It also possible factor act together . Although FFR useful assess degree ischemia cause coronary lesion , give information whether ischemia may clinically significant , i.e . whether ischemia affect large territory . Therefore , implicate FFR may useful predict clinically meaningful ischemia specific side branch vessel . The intracoronary electrocardiography ( i.c . ECG ) sensitive method ischemia detection . The i.c . ECG react early ischemia ; change much prominent easy register . The wire tip could position directly different region thus `` map '' regional ischemia . In study observation become evident surface ECG react i.c . ECG demonstrate significant change ST-segment QRS complex . Moreover , registration i.c . ECG cheap need adapter connect coronary wire end ECG . An i.c . ECG also differentiate residual ischemic change distal main vessel side branch source prolong ischemia , respectively - source periprocedural myonecrosis . The objective study evaluate clinical significance side branch vessel occlude blood flow 1-minute balloon occlusion . We also assess whether change ECG ( i.c . 12-lead surface record ) balloon occlusion relation periprocedural myonecrosis .</brief_summary>
