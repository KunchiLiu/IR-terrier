	<brief_title>Balloon Angioplasty Versus Primary Stenting Treatment Femoropopliteal Artery Chronic Total Occlusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary placement new-generation nitinol stent compare plain old balloon angioplasty show encouraging long-term result femoropopliteal artery . However , complete lack data performance new-generation nitinol stent treatment chronic total occlusion ( CTO ) Femoral artery . This multicenter double-arm randomize trial investigate plain balloon angioplasty versus primary placement self-expanding nitinol stent endovascular recanalization femoral CTOs . Study recruit 200 patient adequately powered detection significant difference vessel patency 1 year .</detailed_description>
