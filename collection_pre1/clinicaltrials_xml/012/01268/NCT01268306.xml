	<brief_summary>Corneal epithelial disruption , commonly term `` corneal staining '' frequently associate contact lens wear . Previous research demonstrate high level observe corneal stain certain combination contact lenses lens care product use , particularly daily wear regimen . B+L lenses make Balafilcon ( PureVision ) associate high rate observe stain . Additionally , polyhexamethylene biguanide ( PHMB ) base lens care product , specifically B+L ReNu MultiPlus implicate high rate stain . In general , many lens construct new , silicone hydrogel ( SiHy ) material appear susceptible increased rate amount corneal stain . Although clinical significance staining debate , clinician agree less stain preferable great amount stain . Advances understand well specific lens care product formulation ideally result design newer product minimize corneal stain maximize product performance . This study examine rate corneal stain use B+L 's recently introduce lens care product : BioTrue B+L PureVision lens previously associate high level stain .</brief_summary>
