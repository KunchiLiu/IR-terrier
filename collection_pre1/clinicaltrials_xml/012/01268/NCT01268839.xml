	<brief_title>A Phase I , Open-label Trial Explore Pharmacokinetics , Safety Tolerability TMC278 ( Rilpivirine ) 25 mg Once Daily Following 2-week Period Receiving Efavirenz , Healthy Male Female Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label ( people involve know identity intervention ) , single center trial healthy HIV negative volunteer investigate pharmacokinetics ( drug absorb body , distribute within body , rate drug action begin , duration effect , chemical change substance body , effect rout excretion metabolite ) drug rilpivirine ( TMC278 ) 25 mg daily ( q.d. ) . An approximate total 20 volunteer enrol trial . All volunteer receive 3 different treatment ; Treatment A : TMC278 25 mg q.d . administer 14 day . ; Treatment B : efavirenz ( EFV ) 600 mg q.d . administer 14 day . ; Treatment C : TMC278 25 mg q.d . administer 28 day ( 4 week ) . ; All volunteer start Treatment A follow Treatment B . Treatments A B separate washout period least 14 day 21 day . At end Treatment B , volunteer continue Treatment C. There washout period Treatments B C. ; Full pharmacokinetic profile TMC278 determine 24 hour postdose Days 1 14 Treatment A ( reference ) , Day 1 ( immediately cessation EFV intake ) Treatment C ( test ) , Days 14 , 21 , 28 ( 2 , 3 , 4 week cessation EFV intake , respectively ) Treatment C. Trough ( C0h ) sample determination TMC278 plasma ; concentration collect regularly . Blood sample determination EFV plasma concentration collect regular time point Treatment B Treatment C cessation EFV intake . ; Serum sample potential future test ex vivo antiviral activity collect store . ; A pharmacogenomic blood sample potential future CYP2B6 genotyping collect stored subject consent separately pharmacogenomic component trial . ; Safety tolerability evaluate throughout trial . Rilpivirine ( TMC278 ) 25mg daily 14 day , No Treatment 14-21 day , Efavirenz 600mg daily 14 day , TMC278 25mg daily 28 day</detailed_description>
