	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III clinical trial study chemotherapy without trastuzumab surgery see well work treat woman invasive breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) give chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective trastuzumab treat breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With Without Trastuzumab After Surgery Treating Women With Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition trastuzumab chemotherapy ( TC AC→WP ) improve invasive disease-free survival ( IDFS ) woman resect node-positive high-risk node-negative breast cancer report human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2-low HER2 testing perform . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition trastuzumab chemotherapy ( TC AC→WP ) improve disease-free survival ( DFS ) -ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) woman resect node-positive high-risk node-negative breast cancer report HER2-low HER2 test perform . II . To determine whether addition trastuzumab chemotherapy ( TC AC→WP ) improve breast cancer-free survival ( BCFS ) woman resect node-positive high-risk node-negative breast cancer report HER2-low HER2 test perform . III . To determine whether addition trastuzumab chemotherapy ( TC AC→WP ) improve recurrence-free interval ( RFI ) woman resect node-positive high-risk node-negative breast cancer report HER2-low HER2 test perform . IV . To determine whether addition trastuzumab chemotherapy ( TC AC→WP ) improve distant recurrence-free interval ( DRFI ) woman resect node-positive high-risk node-negative breast cancer report HER2-low HER2 test perform . V. To determine whether addition trastuzumab chemotherapy ( TC AC→WP ) improve overall survival ( OS ) woman resect node-positive high-risk node-negative breast cancer report HER2-low HER2 test perform . VI . To evaluate association amenorrhea circulate reproductive hormone level , association chemotherapy regimen , amenorrhea , IDFS benefit premenopausal woman eligible baseline menstrual history assessment . VII . To evaluate toxicity associate regimen . VIII . To test hypothesis HER2 messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) level predictor degree benefit trastuzumab threshold benefit adjuvant set lower define current American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) /College American Pathologists ( CAP ) Guidelines HER2 assay ( immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] fluorescent situ hybridization [ FISH ] ) . IX . To identify and/or validate molecular predictor degree benefit addition trastuzumab chemotherapy ( TC AC→WP ) . X . To test alternative hypothesis main determinant trastuzumab response adjuvant set HER2-low breast cancer antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) demonstrate polymorphism Fcgamma receptor gene predictive degree benefit addition trastuzumab chemotherapy ( TC AC→WP ) . XI . To examine relationship behavioral host factor ( obesity , tobacco , alcohol ) comorbid condition may influence systemic inflammation breast cancer outcome , control tumor/stage characteristic treatment assignment . XII . To examine relationship medication exposure may influence systemic inflammation breast cancer outcome , control tumor/stage characteristic treatment assignment . XIII . To examine relationship comorbid condition , medication exposure , behavioral host factor together breast cancer outcome , control tumor/stage characteristic treatment assignment . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . NOTE : *Chemotherapy regimen base investigator 's preference . ARM I : GROUP A : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course . GROUP B : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 15 minute cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 3 week ( investigator 's discretion ) 4 course . Patients receive paclitaxel IV 60 minute weekly 12 dos . ARM II : GROUP A : Patients receive chemotherapy Arm IA . Patients also receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Trastuzumab treatment repeat every 3 week 51 week . GROUP B : Patients receive chemotherapy Arm IB . Patients also receive paclitaxel IV 60 minute weekly trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute weekly 12 dos . After completion paclitaxel , patient receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 13 course . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year every 12 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
