Pressure ulcer diminish quality life , exact devastating loss function , increase risk death geriatric population raise healthcare cost . Costs management pressure ulcers US likely exceed $ 6.4 billion annually , prevalence approximately 12 % high risk LTC population . A previous clinical trial University Pittsburgh study effect seat cushion pressure ulcer incidence find skin protection seat cushion use properly fit wheelchair significant reduction incidence . The data lead investigator question whether properly fit wheelchair also significant effect pressure ulcer incidence . This clinical trial investigate question randomize subject control group receive skin protection cushion wheelchair training use facility supply wheelchair , treatment group receive skin protection cushion , wheelchair train new custom-fitted wheelchair .
