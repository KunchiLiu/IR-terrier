	<brief_summary>A pragmatic cluster randomise control trial do intervention mobile screen team visit select PHC facility Tshwane district . It provide education screen diabetic complication ( foot , kidney , cardiac retinal complication ) . Six clinic receive intervention six clinic serve control . Six hundred patient recruit ( 2 x 300 ) . The screening result evaluate expert panel tertiary care level individualise patient management plan compile . This plan communicate family physician integration team clinic management referral patient . Laser therapy available mobile clinic patient require ( assessed Ophthalmologist review retinal photo ) . A baseline evaluation ( include HbA1c , serum creatinine , lipogram urine albumin-creatinine ratio ) do determine current disease management patient health facility level , follow intervention follow-up visit year later . The main outcome measure glucose , lipid blood pressure control well percentage patient screen referred diabetes complication . A cost effectiveness analysis do estimate add cost per add complication prevent refer . The potential implication improve diabetes care prevent long term complication extremely important . The study result use help plan future health care service people diabetes mellitus region .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Specialist Collaboration Mobile Screening Improving Management Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) major metabolic disease characterise reduce impaired capability body regulate blood glucose level . The disease reach pandemic level . The global prevalence DM ( across age group ) estimate 2,8 % 2000 , rise 4,4 % 2030 . In real number imply 171 million people 366 million people affected globally . This rise certainly impact health care system many country . Most DM patient manage primary health care level . It become clear difficulty achieve satisfactory level health care delivery DM patient related availability knowledge disease , best diagnostic therapeutic procedure , rather system organisational problem . Many complication diabetes potentially preventable minimize early action take . The chronic nature disease need empowerment patient health worker understanding disease ensure optimal glucose control make DM ideal disease test new model health care delivery include patient empowerment , health worker empowerment use telemedicine E-Health . It believe current primary health care approach allow sufficient time personnel provide patient optimal care screen diabetic complication . Currently blood pressure random blood glucose measure take Primary Health Care ( PHC ) facility , even though national policy management diabetes prescribes monitor complication least year . This study investigate benefit comprehensive mobile screen effort identify improve early detection diabetes-related complication . With expect improvement disease management patient specific outcome , study contribute policy change diabetes management primary health care level . This study differ study evaluate complication isolation . It aim evaluate efficacy complex intervention provide interface Specialist Family Medicine Internal Medicine collaborate include mobile comprehensive complication screen service . The study also provide opportunity train clinic staff well exposure train Clinical Associates regard diabetes care complication screen management . It envisage structured screening review programme provide evidence way ensure future collaboration enhance diabetes patient outcomes . The aim pragmatic study investigate effectiveness mobile complication screen team expert review collaboration tertiary care specialist primary care generalist improve optimal , comprehensive diabetic care primary health care level one district South Africa , use cluster randomize control design . STUDY DESIGN A two arm Pragmatic Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial ( C-RCT ) active arm consist mobile screen service control arm receive standard care . 2 . A cross sectional descriptive study patient enrol trial attend screen visit ( clinic know intervention clinic ) . SETTING Primary Health Care ( PHC ) Clinics situate Tshwane Health District , Gauteng Province , South Africa . PATIENT/RESEARCH OBJECT SELECTION All patient type 2 DM type 1 DM minimum five year duration consider intervention comparison arm . Only patient age 18 year enrol study ( Children diabetes manage Primary Care level ) . The first 50 patient meet selection criterion enrol study ( maximum 5 type 1 patient per clinic ) . The rest diabetic clinic also invite onto mobile clinic purpose screen complication , data keep separate study population 's data . It also analyse separately . The study budget allow laboratory test 600 study participant . Sample Size : Prior randomization eligible clinic stratify accord follow criterion intervention control clinic match accordingly : 1 . Type clinic ( primary care clinic health care centre ) 2 . Clinic without full time physician attendance 3 . Number patient diabetes see month ( &lt; &gt; 200 per month ) The investigator reason believe quality care indicator HbA1c differ clinic . A restricted randomization procedure use random number table carried independent researcher ensure equal number clinic group . The sample size base cluster sample estimate do STATA Intercooled Version 10 . Primary outcome 1 : Lowering HbA1c 9.5 % 8.5 % ( thus 1 % reduction ) use ANCOVA adjust baseline HbA1c ; SD=2.4 &amp; r=0.65 , ICC=0.05 continuous variable ; Alpha-value= 0.05 Power 90 % = 198 patient arm 12 cluster require . Primary outcome 2 : DM Complications Detection Proportion improvement 10 % least 30 % ( thus 20 % improvement ) ; ICC=0.02 binary variable ; Alpha=0.05 power=90 % give estimate sample size 275 arm . In order ensure adequate randomization compensate possible loss follow 300 patient evaluated arm ( baseline final evaluation ) . DATA ANALYSIS : The unit analysis Cluster RCT 's change , depend level inference : 1 . Individual level - e.g . clinic unit randomization patient unit analysis 2 . Cluster level - e.g . Clinics unit randomization result analyze clinic Both level analysis use data analysis study . Baseline end study process measure outcome measure : Data enter twice ( validate ) Epidata ( V3.1 ) . Analysis do Stata Intercooled Version 11 . The analysis would use ANCOVA , linear regression logistic regression adjust baseline value effect cluster and/or mixed effect model . Descriptive analysis study population do , cluster- within cluster analysis perform .</detailed_description>
