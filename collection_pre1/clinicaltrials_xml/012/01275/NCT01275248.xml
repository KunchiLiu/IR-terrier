	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Low-Dose Ondansetron For Adjunctive Therapy In Adult Patients With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study . A sufficient number patient screen obtain approximately 150 patient randomize double-blind portion study . This study consist least 6 week retrospectively document SRI treatment ( prior screening ) , 6 week prospective SRI treatment screening ( run-in ) prior randomization , 12 week double-blind treatment study drug ( ondansetron 0.5 mg twice day , ondansetron 0.75 mg twice day placebo twice day ) . All patient maintain single SRI dose throughout retrospective 6-week period continue SRI dose throughout run-in double-blind treatment period . The 12-week randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study `` core period '' purpose efficacy short-term safety assessment . Patients complete 12 week core period offer opportunity participate `` extension period '' continue receive treatment 30 month follow core period . Treatment assignment extension period follow : responder continue double-blind treatment assign core period ( ondansetron 0.5 mg twice day , ondansetron 0.75 mg twice day , placebo twice day ) ; non-responders reassign continue treatment accord prior treatment assignment core period ( receive placebo assign ondansetron 0.5 mg twice day , receive ondansetron 0.5 mg twice day assign ondansetron 0.75 mg twice day , receive ondansetron 0.75 mg twice day continue receive ondansetron 0.75 mg twice day ) . Patients receive treatment double-blind condition ( double-blind phase extension study ) core study complete safety efficacy ondansetron dose confirm If core study data analysis , treatment difference find ondansetron placebo primary efficacy variable , extension study terminate . If core study result positive primary efficacy endpoint safety endpoint , patient participate double-blind phase extension study offer opportunity continue treatment open-label condition dose deem efficacious safe ( open-label phase extension study ) . A Data Review Committee responsible review core study analysis result , provide dose recommendation open-label phase extension study , communicate result recommendation participate institutional review boards/ethics committee ( IRBs/ECs ) investigator . Patients may continue receive treatment 30 month sponsor provide alternative .</detailed_description>
