	<brief_title>Assessment Precision Sherlock 3CG Tip Positioning System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The feasibility phase study ( Phase I ) prospective , single arm , single-center feasibility study determine distance PICC tip upper Caval Atrial junction upon observation maximum p-wave PICC tip placement use Sherlock 3CG system . Subjects judge site personnel require PICC placement screen study inclusion/exclusion criterion . Those subject meet study criterion offer enrollment study . Informed consent obtain prior subject enrollment . PICC nurse fully trained correct use Sherlock 3CG Tip Positioning System perform PICC placement procedure fluoroscopy suite . Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) collect , collection non-serious AEs limit adverse event ( AEs ) consider study procedure and/or device-related . Subject follow complete 30 day follow date study PICC procedure . The result feasibility phase use determine : 1. distance , , require move PICC tip upon observation maximum p-wave amplitude pivotal phase study ( See Section 3.5.3 ) , order PICC tip upper cavoatrial junction . 2. movement cardiovascular anatomy , , arm adduct head side subject . 3. movement PICC tip arm move 90° angle side . Phase II ( Pivotal ) begin Phase I ( feasibility ) complete . The Phase II study prospective , single-center , control , blind , randomize study compare Sherlock 3CG tool guide PICC placement standard `` blind '' technique ( control ) . Subjects judge site personnel require PICC placement screen study inclusion/exclusion criterion . Those subject meet study criterion offer participation study . Informed consent obtain prior subject enrollment . Subjects randomly assign either Sherlock 3CG group control group 1:1 fashion . Due different placement technique utilize , PICC nurse study coordinator blind study device . PICC nurse fully trained correct use Sherlock 3CG perform PICC placement procedure fluoroscopy suite . Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) collect , collection non-serious AEs limit AEs consider study procedure and/or device-related . Subject follow complete 30 day follow date study PICC procedure . Randomization occur due early termination . All participant assign Sherlock 3CG phase I. Randomization would occur start Phase II , Phase II initiate due early termination . Phase II cancel .</detailed_description>
