	<brief_summary>TMC278 ( also call rilpivirine ) new drug develop treat HIV . Usually TMC278 take tablet , mouth , day , 'long act ' formulation develop drug stay bloodstream long time - allow drug give injection less often . It hop injectable version drug may use help prevent HIV transmission future give people risk HIV . This similar way traveller area malaria may take antibiotic prevent infection . The investigator aim investigate feasibility use TMC278 preventative medication perform study . The purpose study investigate level drug measure blood , well tissue fluid rectum ( low part bowel open anus ) well safety drug well tolerate give single dose . In study , investigator investigate whether drug prevents HIV investigator recruit people HIV negative , whose lifestyle put risk become infect study . If study show drug well tolerated produce appropriate level drug ( bloodstream rectal compartment ) suggest could effective , help design future study look prevent HIV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial examine pharmacokinetics dose 300mg 600mg , well either 150mg 1200mg , TMC278LA , give single intramuscular dose HIV-negative participant . Investigation drug pharmacokinetics plasma , female genital secretion tissue sample , male rectal fluid tissue sample ( 600mg dose ) also carry order provide data relative drug exposure follow drug administration . Additionally , ex-vivo assay ass viral inhibition fluid genital secretion rectal compartment provide partial information pharmacodynamic characteristic TMC278 ; may usefully inform future selection decision appropriate target concentration require prevention . The target concentration prophylactic use TMC278 plasma , genital rectal tissue fluid unknown . It possible target lower require treatment establish infection would suitable . However , currently pharmacodynamic data usefully inform target concentration might . In absence population PK data efficacy trial TMC278 prophylactic agent , investigator aim obtain useful indirect data ex-vivo viral inhibition assay least guide future decision dose selection . Up 60 evaluable female participant enrol , 40 % African ancestry . Six male participant also enrol . This provide data plasma pharmacokinetics relative distribution kinetics female genital tract male rectal compartment order support expand safety study phase III global efficacy trial .</detailed_description>
