	<brief_summary>This clinical validation study aim test efficacy new environmental challenge chamber ( ECC ) induce symptom allergic rhinitis patient allergic house dust mite . The symptom record validated symptom score Total Nasal Symptom Score ( TNSS ) , allow determine whether challenge dose dependent reproducible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Environmental Exposure Chamber Inhalation Studies With House Dust Mite Allergen Patients With Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At Fraunhofer ITEM , novel technique create atmosphere load allergenic particle recently develop . In brief , particle produce combined process nebulization dry solution contain soluble allergenic extract lactose . The particle size distribution regulate droplet size distribution lactose concentration solution , allergen content choose independently . Thus , Fraunhofer scientist create universal tool provide possibility create atmosphere contain allergenic particle arbitrary size contain variety different allergen . By choose particle size preferentially deposit nose ( 10 µm ) lung ( 5 10 µm ) , select allergen concentration commonly find environment , possible build challenge atmospheres large variety indication . The first clinical application new method create atmosphere simulate natural exposure house dust mite allergen . The challenge aerosol compose lactose carrier material two major allergen Der p1 Der p2 house dust mites originate licence allergen extract inhaled challenge .</detailed_description>
