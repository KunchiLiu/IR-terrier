	<brief_summary>A bleeding peptic ulcer remain serious medical problem significant morbidity mortality . Endoscopic therapy significantly reduce bleeding , surgery , mortality patient bleed peptic ulcer recommend first hemostatic modality patient . In past year , adjuvant use high-dose proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) endoscopic therapy endorse study . However , low dose PPI also support management patient . The investigator enroll 130 patient active bleed nonbleeding visible vessel study . They randomly assign 40 mg/day 160mg/day IV nexium group . All patient receive successful endoscopic therapy heater probe hemoclip placement . In low dose group ( N=65 ) , 40 mg IV Nexium daily give three day . Thereafter , patient receive 40 mg nexium orally daily two month . In large dose group ( N=65 ) , 160 mg/day continuous infusion give three day . Thereafter , patient receive 40 mg nexium orally daily two month . The primary end point recurrent bleed discharge within 14 day . At day 14 , volume blood transfuse , number surgery perform , mortality rate two group compare well .</brief_summary>
