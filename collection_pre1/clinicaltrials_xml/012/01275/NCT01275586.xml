	<brief_title>Study Tasigna®/Nilotinib ( AMN107 ) Neurofibromatosis ( NF1 ) Patients With Plexiform Neurofibromas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label Pilot Study determine efficacy Tasigna® adult neurofibromatosis ( NF1 ) plexiform neurofibromas secondary goal determine toxicity , tumor marker genetically define population . The rationale study arise response human murine NF1 cell Tasigna® vitro clinical response NF1 patient plexiform neurofibromas use similar drug , Gleevec® . Following enrollment subject initially receive Tasigna orally 200 mg twice daily two week . If tolerate , dose increase 300 mg twice daily minimum two week increase maximum dose 400mg twice daily additional two week tolerate . Subjects his/her dose increase tolerate dose first three month therapy . The maximum target dose 400mg twice daily .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients &gt; = 18 year age . 2 . Clinical diagnosis neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) 3 . Presence clinically significant plexiform neurofibroma ( tumor potentially life threaten impinge vital structure significant impairment quality life pain symptom ) 4 . Patients must measurable disease magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors , see Appendix 4 ) 5 . Patients must Karnofsky Performance Status ≥50 % 6 . Adequate end organ function , define follow : Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN ANC &gt; 1.5 x 109/L Platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN Does apply patient isolated hyperbilirubinemia ( e.g. , Gilbert 's disease ) grade &lt; 3 . AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN Serum amylase lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN Patients must follow laboratory value ( WNL = within normal limit local institution lab ) correct within normal limit supplement prior first dose study medication : Potassium ( WNL ) Magnesium ( WNL ) Phosphorus ( WNL ) Calcium ( WNL ) 1 . Previous treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor 2 . Impaired cardiac function include one following : . Inability monitor QT interval ECG ii . Congenital long QT syndrome know family history long QT syndrome . iii . Clinically significant rest brachycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) iv . QTc &gt; 450 msec baseline ECG . If QTc &gt; 450 msec electrolyte within normal range , electrolyte correct patient rescreened QTc v. Myocardial infarction within 12 month prior start study vi . Other clinically significant uncontrolled heart disease ( e.g . unstable angina , congestive heart failure uncontrolled hypertension ) vii . History presence clinically significant ventricular atrial tachyarrhythmias 3 . Patients currently receive treatment strong CYP3A4 inhibitor treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug . ( Appendix 1 ) . 4 . Patients currently receive treatment medication potential prolong QT interval treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug ( Appendix 3 ) 5 . Impaired gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection gastric bypass surgery ) . 6 . Acute chronic pancreatic disease 7 . Patient known brain metastasis . Non specific CNS change MRI characteristic NF1 allow . 8 . Another primary malignant disease , require systemic treatment ( chemotherapy radiation ) 9 . Acute chronic liver disease severe renal disease consider unrelated cancer . 10 . History significant congenital acquire bleed disorder unrelated cancer 11 . Major surgery within 4 week prior Day 1 study recover prior surgery . 12 . Treatment investigational agent within 30 day Day 1 . 13 . History noncompliance medical regimen inability grant consent . 14 . Female patient pregnant , breast feeding , childbearing potential without negative pregnancy test prior baseline . Male female patient childbearing potential unwilling use contraceptive precaution throughout trial 3 month follow discontinuation study drug . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior first dose nilotinib .</criteria>
