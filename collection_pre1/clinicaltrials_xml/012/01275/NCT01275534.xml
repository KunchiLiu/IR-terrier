	<brief_summary>In study PROVIVO , patient report outcome instrument consist item PRO-CTCAE item bank measure symptom experience long-term survivor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) develop . The instrument development base cognitive patient interview , survey hematology expert literature review . In subsequent cross-sectional study phase , instrument validate sample 300 allogeneic stem cell recipient use additional self report instrument possible explore subjective symptom experience , problem self-management presence late effect connect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Symptom Experience Self-management After Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long-term survivor allogeneic SCT presumably life-long increased risk develop various adverse side effect ; also term 'late effect ' . Late effect may appear month year treatment end , persist chronically may experience rather distress burdensome . Since late effect experience subjectively form physical mental symptom seldom capture objective clinician-based evaluation , use self-report instrument important early detection , management alleviation symptom . The collection self-report data study clinical practice strongly recommend National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) : develop Patient-Reported Outcomes bank base well established Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( PRO-CTCAE ) . Besides manage symptom associate late-effects , patient SCT also request manage emotion associate chronic illness , new life role order meaningful , fulfil life , medical regimen , view take medication , smoke cessation , regularly exercise monitor sign infection . However , evidence investigate prevalence problem related complex set self-management task scarce . Aims : - To translate PRO-CTCAE item German culturally-sensitive way develop content self-report instrument measure symptom experience allogeneic SCT - To validate newly develop scale ass psychometric property - To examine self report symptom experience objective measure late effect 300 adult survivor ≥ 1 year SCT - To describe self-management behaviour 300 adult survivor ≥ 1 year SCT - To assess relationship symptom experience objective burden late effect , survivor ' perception late effect self-management view manage emotion , manage new life role manage medical health task 300 adult survivor ≥ 1 year allogeneic SCT</detailed_description>
