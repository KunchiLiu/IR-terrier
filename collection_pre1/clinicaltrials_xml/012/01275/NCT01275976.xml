	<brief_summary>Trauma major operation associate excessive inflammation reaction due tissue injury . This overwhelming immune response consider major risk factor pathogenesis late inflammatory complication acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) sepsis . The investigator hypothesize administration C1-esterase inhibitor ( C1-INH ) attenuate humane inflammatory response , thereby , reduce risk inflammatory complication due surgical intervention trauma patient femur pelvic fracture</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect C1-esterase Inhibitor Systemic Inflammation Trauma Patients With Femur Pelvic Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic inflammation response femur pelvic fracture fixation associate complication , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) . The injury , also additional fixation procedure give release pro-inflammatory cytokine , particular interleukin ( IL ) -6 . This result aggravation initial systemic inflammatory response , cause patient increase risk development inflammatory complication , like ARDS MODS . Which lead high morbidity , mortality prolong hospital stay . Various strategy , damage control orthopedics , propose prevent complication . Another strategy decrease inflammatory reaction cause surgical procedure , intervention focus inhibition innate inflammatory response . This low risk complication . A promising candidate endogenously produce serum protein C1-esterase inhibitor ( C1-INH ) . This protein acute phase protein , produce liver response inflammatory condition . C1-INH major inactivator complement system , important additional anti-inflammatory property demonstrate . A previous study laboratory show administration drug C1-INH significantly reduce concentration circulate pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 , human experimental endotoxemia . Treatment C1-INH proven safe treatment human , even high dosage pregnant patient C1-INH deficiency .</detailed_description>
