	<brief_summary>Patients malignant obstructive jaundice ( cancer head pancreas cholangiocarcinoma ) generally poor prognosis le 20 % patient resectable disease presentation . These patient also poor quality life life expectancy 6-8 month . Jaundice associate pruritus , poor appetite , malabsorption loss weight cholangitis common troublesome problem . Placement metallic stent standard care patient unresectable disease . However , 50 % stent get block 6-8 month . Use endoscopic Radio-frequency Ablation ( RFA ) prior placement metal stent may increase patency stent</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Endoscopic RFA Prolonging Patency Metal Stents Patients With Malignant Obstructive Jaundice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We assume application endobiliary RFA malignant stricture result considerable charring tumor would result prolongation Self-expandable metal Stent ( SEMS ) patency decrease tumor in-growth overgrowth . It speculate prolonged stent patency improve quality life patient , prevent cholangitis optimize chemotherapy . A outcome may improvement survival . The research question intend answer trial would : 1 . Does application prior endo-biliary radiofrequency affect patency SEMS ? 2 . What complication associate use endo-biliary RFA ? 3 . Does endo-biliary RFA immediate placement SEMS improve patient survival ? 4 . Is improvement quality life patient combine use endo-biliary RFA SEMS ? Study protocol : The study design double blind , sham operate , randomize control trial . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Patients : Clinical data investigation suggestive unresectable malignant bile duct obstruction . All patient discuss hepato-biliary multidisciplinary meeting come unanimous decision tumor unresectability . 2 . Age 18 year 3 . Histologically/ Cytologically confirm malignancy 4 . Informed consent : The patient voluntarily agree participation randomization . Oral write information nature trial give patient consider inclusion . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Informed consent obtain withdrawn 2 . Extremely poor general condition amenable conscious sedation use Endoscopic retrograde Cholangiography ( ERC ) 3 . Candidate suitable surgical resection 4 . Klatskin type 4 tumor 5 . Previous biliary intervention plastic stent insertion 1 month 6 . Any contra-indication ERC Randomization : After obtain informed consent satisfy inclusion criterion , patient randomize one follow two arm use computer generate randomization block . The operator patient blind use RFA 1 . Experimental arm : Insertion activation endo-biliary RF catheter site stricture insertion SEMS 2 . Control arm : Insertion sham activation endo-biliary RF catheter site stricture insertion SEMS . All patient get SEMS variable length ( depend stricture size ) maintain uniformity . Endoscopic sphincterotomy perform patient prior endo-biliary RF application SEMS insertion . Opacification cystic duct whether endo-biliary RFA catheter place cystic duct opening record . Data Collection : Baseline data collect advanced endoscopy fellow include age , gender , WHO performance score , presence gall bladder gall stone , primary tumor type stage , baseline liver function test , adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy After discharge hospital , patient follow clinic 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month . At visit , detailed clinical history , examination , adverse event , adjuvant therapy liver function test carry . Patients assess accord World Health Organization performance classification . WHO score - 0 - Asymptomatic ( Fully active , able carry predisease activity without restriction ) - 1 - Symptomatic completely ambulatory ( Restricted physically strenuous activity ambulatory able carry work light sedentary nature . For example , light housework , office work ) - 2 - Symptomatic , &lt; 50 % bed day ( Ambulatory capable self care unable carry work activity . Up 50 % waking hour ) - 3 - Symptomatic , &gt; 50 % bed , bedbound ( Capable limit self-care , confine bed chair 50 % waking hour ) - 4 - Bedbound ( Completely disable . Can carry self-care . Totally confined bed chair ) - 5 - Death All patient refer oncological opinion palliative chemotherapy . The patient care-givers tell symptom cholangitis stent obstruction ask contact hospital immediately case . In event confirm SEMS occlusion , either new SEMS plastic stent place depend patient 's prognosis . End point : 1 . Stent occlusion : 1 . Cholangitis 2. serum bilirubin &gt; 3mg/dL previously normal bilirubin baseline . 3 . Any clinical jaundice confirm caused stent occlusion image ERC 2 . Death 3 . Uneventful follow-up 12 month Evaluation : The primary aim compare two group duration stent patency . The secondary aim : 1 . To study complication attributable endo-biliary RFA 2 . To study improvement patient survival 3 . To study improvement patient 's quality life Statistics : We assume metal stent patency improve 50 % 80 % 6-8 month . With 80 % power alpha error 5 % , need 43 patient arm . The Fisher exact test use evaluate difference patient distribution . The Student unpaired test use compare laboratory test , age sex . Cumulative stent patency patient survival estimate use Kaplan-Meier method .</detailed_description>
