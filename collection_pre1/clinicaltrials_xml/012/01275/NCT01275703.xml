	<brief_summary>Subjects study diagnose pulmonary hypertension doctor refer exercise test part normal , routine care . The exercise test either treadmill test 6 minute walk test . During treadmill test , patient typically walk treadmill heart monitor use electrocardiogram , record electrical activity heart 10 small electrode patch attach skin chest , arm legs . Additionally , heart rate blood pressure monitor throughout test . A 6-Minute Walk test require patient walk 6 minute determine far go order measure heart function relate exercise . The purpose study measure internal heart pressure use device call Noninvasive Cardiac Output Monitoring ( NICOM ) exercise test . Normally heart pressure measure invasive ( mean doctor go inside body use needle surgery ) heart procedure . The NICOM device non-invasive mean investigator go inside body obtain heart pressure measurement . In study , investigator evaluate non-invasive measurement provide NICOM device exercise test see relate information subject ' past heart procedure . This research do devise well , less invasive way assess disease severity , track disease progression evaluate response therapy . The NICOM device approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) measure heart pressure . This device usually use patient ca n't undergo right heart catheterization . In study , investigator use device gather heart pressure measurement research exercise test schedule part subject ' normal , routine care . The research data use devise well , less invasive way assess disease severity , track disease progression evaluate response therapy . The NICOM device make Cheetah Medical .</brief_summary>
