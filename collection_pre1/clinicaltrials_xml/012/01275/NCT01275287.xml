	<brief_summary>The purpose research study see Eculizumab ( Soliris® ) safely use addition conventional therapy patient active ANCA ( Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies ) vasculitis lead rapid decrease disease activity . ANCA vasculitis inflammation small vessel whereby ANCA antibodies inappropriately activate one 's white blood cell ( neutrophil ) cause damage small blood vessel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeting Complement Activation Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies ( ANCA ) -Vasculitis - Eculizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent laboratory study identify important pathway inflammation call `` complement pathway '' may play important role Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies ( ANCA ) cause damage blood vessel . Eculizumab monoclonal antibody target key component complement pathway name C5 , block activation . In mouse model ANCA vasculitis , show block C5 activation block development vasculitis greatly reduce severity . The researcher study would like see take eculizumab , addition drug usually use treat ANCA vasculitis , would beneficial treat ANCA vasculitis . Currently , conventional treatment ANCA vasculitis consist corticosteroid cyclophosphamide . The corticosteroid give vein ( methylprednisolone ) 3 day follow prednisone mouth daily 4-5 month . Cyclophosphamide typically give vein every 4 week least 3 month , sometimes longer depend whether vasculitis still active . After vasculitis remission , maintenance treatment azathioprine mycophenolate mofetil may use . For patient tolerate cyclophosphamide , receive large dos previously , another medication call rituximab may use instead . However , patient need rituximab recently treat rituximab participate study . The study drug , eculizumab , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve indication ANCA vasculitis . It investigational drug NOT FDA-approved treatment ANCA vasculitis . In study , eculizumab give addition standard care treatment patient randomise eculizumab group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Patients active Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies ( ANCA ) glomerulonephritis and/or small vessel vasculitis de novo relapse disease ( BVAS≥5 ) . Patients must current history positive ANCA ELISA technique . De novo relapse disease require immunosuppression . Patients must evidence active glomerulonephritis evidence presence glomerular hematuria ( dysmorphic Red Blood Cells ( RBCs ) RBC cast ) without increase serum creatinine . Patients eligible within 10 day commence induction therapy ( i.e. , may already receive pulse methylprednisolone first dose cyclophosphamide ) . • Pregnancy lactation , woman child bear potential willing able comply 2 contraceptive method . Patients severe renal failure : creatinine &gt; 6 mg/dL receive hemodialysis and/or receive plasmapheresis therapy . Patients severe pulmonary hemorrhage require ventilation and/or plasmapheresis therapy . Patients active bacterial viral infection . Absolute neutrophils count &lt; 1000/mm^3 minimize risk infection Hemoglobin &lt; 8.5 g/dL Prior therapy monoclonal antibody ( example rituximab ) within previous 6 month . Peripheral CD20 Bcells count &lt; = 1 % due rituximab even longer 6 month . Severe coexist condition preclude immunosuppressive therapy condition require intravenous antibiotic therapy . History infection Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , HIV , tuberculosis syphilis .</criteria>
