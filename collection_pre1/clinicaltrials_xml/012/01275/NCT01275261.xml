	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether bladder catheterization safely avoid patient admitted hospital stroke use nursing protocol , whether decrease incidence urinary tract infection . The investigator hypothesize protocol tolerate nurse patient , patient without bladder catheter fewer urinary tract infection well outcomes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Avoidance Bladder Catheters Stroke Patients Avoid Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical complication , minor serious , play large role post-stroke management outcome . Infection , especially pneumonia urinary tract infection ( UTI ) , one common medical complication stroke . In addition , immunosuppression secondary stroke may increase risk infection stroke , fever secondary infection may result poor outcome . UTIs occur 3 16 % patient within first week month cerebrovascular event . Compared patient develop post-stroke UTIs , UTI poorer outcome ; patient approximately 3-fold increase odds higher mRS , 4.5-fold high odds combine endpoint death disability . Between 15 % 25 % hospitalized patient receive short-term indwelling urinary catheter , often unnecessarily . In general medical population , risk UTI range 3 % -10 % per day catheterization , approach 100 % 30 continuous day . Catheter-associated UTI ( CAUTI ) second commonly report healthcare-associated infection acute care hospital , account approximately one-third infection report National Healthcare Safety Network 2006-2007 , leading cause secondary nosocomial bloodstream infection . CAUTIs estimate cost $ 589 $ 758 per infection , 17 69 % may preventable . The recently release draft guideline Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) prevention CAUTI suggest appropriate indication indwell urethral catheter use , include acute urinary retention obstruction , need accurate measurement urinary output critically ill patient , prolonged immobilization , estimate 20 50 % hospitalized patient urinary catheter place without clear indication . We conduct pilot RCT determine tolerability efficacy protocol avoid catheter placement patient admit UCSF neurovascular service ischemic stroke intracerebral hemorrhage . There two study arm : usual care control group catheter placement admission , intervention group catheter place admission . The intervention arm treat use protocol , develop multidisciplinary team , institute nurse avoid need catheter placement . The sample follow hospital admission , main outcome measure tolerability protocol nursing staff , patient comfort incidence UTI hospitalization . The subject follow hospitalization follow-up telephone call make 90-days post-stroke . We hypothesize limit use Foley catheter medical indication note CDC guideline , current standard practice , decrease number catheter place , thereby reduce number UTIs stroke patient . The ultimate goal study improve clinical outcome , decrease hospital length stay , cost care , time rehabilitation among patient suffer stroke .</detailed_description>
