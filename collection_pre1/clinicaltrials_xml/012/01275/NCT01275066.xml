	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 study evaluate efficacy safety 2.0 mg/kg/week BMN 110 2.0 mg/kg/every week BMN 110 patient mucopolysaccharidosis IVA ( Morquio A Syndrome ) . There currently standard accept treatment MPS IVA supportive care . Enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) may potential new treatment option MPS IVA patient . BMN 110 administer MPS IVA patient IV infusion , allow cellular uptake mannose-6-phosphate receptor transportation lysosomes . This enzyme uptake lysosome hypothesized promote increase catabolism keratan sulfate ( KS ) tissue macrophage , hyaline cartilage , connective tissue , heart valve , reduce progressive accumulation KS responsible clinical manifestation disorder .</brief_summary>
