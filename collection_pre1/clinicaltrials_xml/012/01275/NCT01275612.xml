	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells In Cisplatin-Induced Acute Renal Failure In Patients With Solid Organ Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since introduction clinical trial , cisplatin ( cis-diammine-dichloro-platinum ) major impact cancer medicine , change course therapeutic management several tumor , ovary , testis , head neck . Unfortunately , addition cause bone marrow suppression , ototoxicity , anaphylaxis , dose-dependent cumulative nephrotoxicity major toxicity compound , sometimes require reduction dose discontinuation treatment . Approximately 25-35 % patient develop evidence nephrotoxicity follow initial dose ( 50-100 mg/m2 ) cisplatin , due preferential accumulation within proximal tubular cell outer medulla kidney . Tubular cell event activate cisplatin toxicity translate fact cisplatin predictably lower glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) clear dose-dependent manner even single drug exposure . Early proteinuria mild , glycosuria . Overall finding indicate press need way protect kidney administer effective chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin . Present strategy treatment acute renal failure focus target individual mechanism think contribute ischemic toxic insult kidney.An alternative possibility adopt novel strategy would allow regeneration injured renal tissue . Renal recovery follow acute tubular injury , like induced cisplatin treatment , often slow process require many day week occur . Attempts accelerate recovery focus administration growth factor , hepatocyte growth factor , insulin-like growth factor-1 . While growth factor therapy successful experimental model , beneficial effect observe limited clinical trial . The ability extrarenal cell participate regenerative response follow post-transplant acute renal failure may hold true acute renal failure develop native kidney cisplatin therapy . The rationale approach rest recent demonstration mouse athymic nude rat stem cell bone marrow use grow new muscle blood vessel heart tissue damage myocardial infarction . Similarly , consistent evidence beneficial effect bone-marrow derive cell therapy recently report human ischemic heart disease . This approach also successfully extend repair ischemically cisplatin injured renal tubule mice . The observation raise possibility adult-derived bone marrow cell could administer enhance recovery renal injury . Although human data far available , expect ex-vivo expand donor bone-marrow derive mesenchymal stromal cell ( MSC ) infusion would allow accelerate tubular regeneration thus renal function recovery patient cisplatin-induced acute renal failure , disease , like ischemically-induced acute renal injury , far cure . Up clinical study repair tissue injury patient acute renal failure due ischemic toxic insult . Nevertheless , clinical data effectiveness MSC infusion diseases/conditions like inborn error metabolism , osteogenesis imperfecta , allogeneic HSC transplantation , treatment acute GVHD , acute myocardial infarction . The aim pilot , explorative , study test feasibility safety systemic infusion donor ex-vivo expand MSC repair kidney improve function patient solid organ cancer develop acute renal failure chemotherapy cisplatin .</detailed_description>
