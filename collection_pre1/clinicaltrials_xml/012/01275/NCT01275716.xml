	<brief_summary>Subjects research study Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) . This occur build-up fatty material wall heart arteries cause narrowing artery . This could lead chest pain , heart attack , weaken heart and/or permanent damage heart . As part normal routine care , subject Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) restore blood flow artery heart . During PCI procedure , picture take artery treatment narrow artery . These picture acquire angiography way produce X-ray picture inside artery . After PCI procedure , possibility narrow artery return . The likelihood happen greatly reduce lifestyle change adhere heart medication regimen . It part normal , routine care CAD patient give write verbal information lead heart healthy lifestyle take heart medication properly . In research study , investigator show half patient image heart arteries narrow occur treat . The half patient show image . Both group still receive information lifestyle medication part normal , routine care . At end study , investigator compare group see difference make lifestyle change take heart medication properly .
