Our previous study investigate effect high fat , low carbohydrate ( HFLC ) meal comparison low fat , high carbohydrate ( LFHC ) meal find HFLC meal result significantly increase feeling calmness , friendliness reduction feeling anger , increase subjective energy level comparison LFHC meal . However , chronic effect HFLC LFHC diet study . This purpose study investigate whether 2 week diet high either fat carbohydrate improve cognition/memory mood . It hypothesise prolonged feeding HFLC diet attenuate response see HFLC meal provide . Twenty healthy woman require attend School Biomedical Sciences seven occasion . The first visit involve screen test suitability inclusion study write , informed consent obtain . Weight , height blood pressure measure 5ml blood sample collect full blood count , urea , electrolytes random blood glucose assessment . Subjects ask complete questionnaire regard general health , eat habit , mood medical history . Following screen visit , subject ask record habitual food intake physical activity pattern 3 day period ( 2 weekday 1 weekend day . They attend laboratory 6 occasion , familiarisation visit 5 study visit . The familiarisation visit require ensure subject comfortable familiar use cognitive test administer . Subjects provide menu food consume even meal prior study visit , base 30 % total energy expenditure . This meal base food subject record complete food diary contain approximately 15 % total energy protein , 55 % carbohydrate 30 % fat . Before study visit subject instructed consume standardise meal last meal day 20.00 previous evening . After consumed meal instruct consume food drink apart water arrive lab . Subjects arrive ( fast ) lab 08.00 morning study visit . A cannula insert retrograde hand vein , prior infiltration insertion site 1 % lidocaine . The hand place heat box , remain throughout trial , obtain arterialised venous blood sample . The cannula keep patent slow infusion 0.9 % saline , sample take via three-way tap .

A 3ml sample take every 15minutes first 90 minute , analysis insulin glucose . A baseline sample triglyceride cholesterol take begin study visit . Cognitive test ( measure attention reaction time vigilance ) complete 0 , 45 , 90 135 minute minute provision breakfast . After 180 minute , cannula remove subject free leave lab . Subjects provide either HFLC diet LFHC diet consume 2 week . These diet design meet subject energy requirement . After consume diet 2 week ( diet comprise 3 meal 3 snack per day ) , subject return laboratory second study visit . Subjects provide set visual analogue scale complete day 4 , 8 12 intervention period . Subjects return habitual diet 2 week , complete second intervention . Subjects also ask come laboratory additional study visit either 2 day visit 1 two day visit 3 , consume habitual breakfast instead HFLC LFHC breakfast .
