	<brief_summary>This study do learn safety study drug bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) , use treat radiation necrosis . The primary objective study test feasibility treat Central Nervous System ( CNS ) tumor patient suffer radiation necrosis bevacizumab every 2 week . The secondary objective study : - To evaluate improvement neurologic symptom associate bevacizumab assess clinical evaluation ; - To investigate neuro-imaging change radiation necrosis associate edema , include Mass Resonance ( MR ) spectroscopy ; - To evaluate change corticosteroid use patient radiation necrosis follow treatment bevacizumab ; - To evaluate change quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment Plan : For patient consent enrol study , bevacizumab administer dose 10 mg/kg IV every 2 week total 6 dos ( 3 doses/cycle ) . Patients expect receive least 1 cycle ( 6 week ) study treatment unless unacceptable drug reaction occur . Patients receive second cycle treatment long treatment tolerate . Response assessment perform every 6 week ( three doses/cycle study drug ) include clinical radiological assessment . Secondary measure include documentation total equivalent steroid dose , length time steroid , quality life use modify McMaster Health Instrument scale also collect treatment 30 day finish treatment . Safety assess routine physical laboratory evaluation . Adverse event record severity grade accord NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( version 4.0 ) .</detailed_description>
