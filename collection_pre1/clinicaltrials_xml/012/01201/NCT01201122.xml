	<brief_title>Once Versus Twice Daily Mesalamine Induce Remission Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several randomize control trial ( RCTs ) affirm efficacy 5-aminosalicylic acid ( 5-ASA ) sulfasalazine acute treatment mild moderate exacerbation , well maintenance clinical remission . Initially , common practice prescribe 5-ASA three divide dos . Slow release daily mesalamine Multi Matrix System ( MMX ) technology show effective induction maintenance remission adult ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Since transit time colon much slow small-bowel , since active ingredient act locally colon , less frequent dose regular formulation may also provide sufficient colonic coverage . Indeed , two recent study among adult UC suggest daily dose mesalamine ( Pentasa® Salofalk® ) may effective twice daily dose . To date , RCTs conduct among adult patient efficacy child extrapolate data . However , childhood inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) may similar adult onset disease . The prevalence extensive colitis proximal splenic flexure double pediatric-onset UC compare adult extensive disease consistently associate severe phenotype . On hand , study child IBD often show good response therapy adult . Therefore , American European regulating agency encourage pediatric study conduct approved drug product . It find less 50 % child IBD adherent treatment , figure associate understanding disease generally low adult . Therefore , advantage daily dose 5-ASA twice-daily may great child compare adult . The investigator hypothesize daily dose mesalamine superior effectiveness twice daily dose induce remission pediatric mild-moderate UC . We base hypothesis data previously find adult due expect high adherence rate . This study compare two group receive identical dose non experimental medication , difference number dose medication !</detailed_description>
