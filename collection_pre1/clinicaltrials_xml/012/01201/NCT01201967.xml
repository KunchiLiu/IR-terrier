	<brief_summary>For trial , investigator propose prospective trial collaborative care program identify treat depression , generalize anxiety disorder , panic disorder among patient admit hospital acute cardiac illness ( acute coronary syndrome , congestive heart failure , arrhythmia ) . Such assessment treatment depression/generalized anxiety disorder/panic disorder begin hospital , ongoing management continue six month follow discharge . The investigator hypothesize model lead increase treatment rate , improve mood , reduce anxiety , improve medical outcome vulnerable population . If model effective , could implement clinically provide good complete care patient hospitalize acute cardiac illness , depression anxiety may risk factor complication death . This two-arm , single-blind randomize controlled trial , one-half patient randomize collaborative care one-half randomize control condition ( usual care ) . Psychiatric treatment intervention arm provide concert patient ' primary care physicians—with primary care physician prescribe medications—within framework supervise psychiatrist . The investigator enroll patient ( ) three include psychiatric diagnosis improve utility intervention . The investigator choose enroll patient several different cardiac diagnosis . This allow researcher include patient heterogeneous diagnosis illness severity determine intervention effective broad population patient heart disease . The investigator study intervention target depression , generalize anxiety disorder , panic disorder : three disorder disable associated adverse cardiovascular outcome , treatment condition highly similar , investigator treat patient one disorder , prior outpatient program successfully simultaneously address one mental health condition . The project involve : ( 1 ) screening patient depression , generalize anxiety disorder , panic disorder part usual clinical care , ( 2 ) evaluation positive-screen patient study social work care manager , ( 3 ) multicomponent in-hospital intervention ( collaborative care patient ) involve patient education , specialist-provided treatment recommendation , goal in-hospital treatment initiation , ( 4 ) , discharge , continue phone-based evaluation care coordination primary care physician provide stepwise treatment collaborative care arm . The intervention design low-cost , low-burden , easily generalizable setting .</brief_summary>
