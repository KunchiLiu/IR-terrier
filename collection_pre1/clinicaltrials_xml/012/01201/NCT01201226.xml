	<brief_title>Can Dormant Perimenopausal Ovarian Follicles Become FSH Responsive ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Women stop menstruate mean age 51 , yet pregnancies become much less prevalent beyond 40 , pregnancy 43 relative rarity . Current common perception attribute regression fertility depletion primordial follicle ' pool ( Burger et al . 2008 ) . The decline fertility may result necessarily sharp depletion primordial follicle pool ( Hansen et al . 2008 ) may due failure adequate transition primordial antral , gonadotropin-responsive follicle . It infrequent encounter fertility patient late thirty early forty , would respond extreme dos exogenous FSH , nevertheless continue menstruate age 50 . The usual practice refer patient oocyte donation program . Recently , Li et al . ( 2010 ) demonstrate incubation neonatal mouse ovarian fragment inhibitor Phosphatase TENsin homology delete chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) phosphatase PI3K activate peptide , increase nuclear exclusion Foxo3 propel large number dormant primordial follicle become FSH-responsive antral follicle . Furthermore , nude mouse model ( mice lack immune system ) show transplanted human ovarian fragment contain mainly primordial follicle surgical specimen , treat incubation , also underwent activation dormant follicle derive preovulatory follicle contain mature oocyte . Based hypothesize , ovary woman perimenopausal year could propel become FSH-responsive , use incubation PTEN inhibitor PI3K activate peptide activate dormant primordial follicle . If find feasible , technique could provide hope achieve fertility patient would otherwise refer receive oocyte donation . Aim propose study To obtain ovarian cortical fragment perimenopausal patient , undergo gynecological surgery , test whether treatment PTEN phosphatase PI3K activate peptide would induce fragment produce FSH responsive follicle nude mouse model . Study subject specimen harvest Up ten woman , old 45 year , schedule gynecological operation , ask provide half ovary study . The tissue cut multiple fragment , suitable cryopreservation . Laboratory method Cryopreservation ovarian fragment use vitrification protocol similar earlier report oocyte cryo-storage ( Yoon et al . 2003 ) . Because cryo-preservation reagent easily penetrate primordial follicle compare large oocyte , anticipate efficient preservation follicle . In young patient , one 1 mm cortical cube contains ~50 primordial follicle . Three tissue sample patient transfer Hsueh laboratory Stanford ( attached letter ) , thaw vitro activation follow xeno-transplantation use protocol describe Li et al . laboratory . ( Li et al . 2010 ) . The vitro incubation bpV ( pic ) ( Calbiochem ) , PTEN inhibitor , allow activation dormant follicle . cell-permeable phospho-peptide ( 740Y-P ) ( Tocris ) capable bind SH2 domain p85 regulatory subunit PI3K stimulate enzyme activity . Activated PI3K convert phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) -bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) phosphatidylinositol ( 3-5 ) -trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) , whereas PTEN inhibitor prevents conversion PIP3 back PIP2 . Accumulated PIP3 , turn , could stimulate phosphorylation Akt increase nuclear exclusion transcriptional factor Foxo3 .</detailed_description>
