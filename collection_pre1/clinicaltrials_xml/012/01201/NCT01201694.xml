	<brief_title>Phase I Study Surface-Controlled Water Soluble Curcumin ( THERACURMIN CR-011L )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Curcumin active ingredient spice , turmeric . It natural anti-inflammatory compound show anti-tumor activity . Surface-controlled water dispersible curcumin design well absorb body regular curcumin . Study Groups : The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group usually receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . Each group 3-6 participant . This continue high tolerable dose curcumin find . Up 6 dose level curcumin test . Once high tolerable dose arm find , 14 extra participant enrol extra safety test . In case , extra participant may enrol dose level show safe extra safety and/or pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test . You assign dose level base join study . The dose study drug receive may lower intolerable side effect . If tolerating treatment , study drug dose may increase first cycle high dose level show safe . Study Drug Administration : Each study `` cycle '' 28 day long . You take 1 dose curcumin Day 1 Cycle 1 . Starting Day 2 Cycle 1 , begin take curcumin 2 time day . Curcumin liquid come bottle , take mouth empty stomach full glass water ( 8 ounce ) . If tolerating dos doctor think need , may take curcumin divide dose several time day food . Study Visits : Before first dose study drug Week 2 Cycle 2 , complete questionnaire quality life . It take 5-10 minute complete . Every week Cycle 1 often doctor think need , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Before begin cycle : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may . At end Cycle 2 every 2-3 cycle : - You chest x-ray , CT , MRI , and/or PET scan check status disease . If study doctor think need , scan may perform often . You also may extra type scan list consent form . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . PK Testing : Blood ( Â½ teaspoon time ) drawn PK test follow time : - On Day 1 Cycle 1 , blood drawn dose 6 time next 6 hour dose . - On Day 2 Cycle 1 , blood drawn 1 time . Length Study : You may remain study long study doctor think best interest . You take study early disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug ( ) , end-of-study visit . At visit follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ask side effect may . - If study doctor think need , chest x-ray , CT , MRI , and/or PET scan check status disease . If study doctor think need , may also extra type scan . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . This investigational study . Curcumin commercially available substance , commonly use food additive . Curcumin FDA approve usage . At time , curcumin use research . Up 72 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
