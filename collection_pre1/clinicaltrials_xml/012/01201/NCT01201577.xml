	<brief_summary>It recently discover bacteria able communicate use specialised molecule know Quorum Sensing Signalling Molecules ( QSSMs ) . An accumulation QSSMs surround environment allow bacteria quantify size colony . At specific colony size concentration QSSMs reach critical threshold lead activation gene cause infection . It mechanism bacteria within colony coordinate behaviour activate infectivity colony size large enough withstand defensive measure host 's immune system . A disruption quorum sensing may reduce severity infection lead development inhibitor quorum sense new strategy antibacterial therapy . QSSMs also think facilitate infection mechanism able influence number function specific type immune cell know 'antigen present cell ' . These cell pivotal allow immune system recognise component bacteria foreign thereby mount appropriate response . It find large number type cell underwent program cell death ( cell suicide ) presence QSSMs compare QSSMs absent . This mirror situation blood sample patient severe infection great proportion cell death among antigen present cell type immune cell . This study aim establish healthy volunteer , mechanism QSSMs affect immune cell facilitate spread infection . Antibiotic administration human alter environment intestine lead overgrowth harmful bacteria potentially cause infection . Probiotics supplement prevent bacterial overgrowth potentially reduce infective complication . The mechanism , aim clarify , may involve change production QSSMs function immune cell . Hypothesis 1 . Antibiotic use alters gut flora , lead appearance systemic circulation bacterial QSSMs change immune function host . 2 . Probiotics and/or prebiotics beneficial effect preserve normal resident gut flora , thereby , modulate bacterial QSSMs preserve immune function host . Aims The aim study 2 fold : 1 . Firstly , study effect orally administer antibiotic QSSMs ( faeces blood ) innate adaptive immunity healthy human . 2 . Secondly , study effect orally administer combination prebiotic , probiotic antibiotic QSSMs ( faeces blood ) innate adaptive immunity healthy human .</brief_summary>
