	<brief_summary>Despite recent advance stent technology clot reduce drug therapy , acute stent occlusion thrombosis ( ST ) , still occur life threaten . It show certain feature stent relates artery wall may predict ST. One feature , so-called stent strut malapposition ( SSM ) , assess implantation current image technique relatively unreliable . Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) new technology perform safely easily angioplasty may allow stent strut assess accurately reliably . This study use OCT examine two different type commonly use drug-eluting stent relate artery wall . The Xience V ( Abbott Vascular , USA ) stent thinner strut open frame Cypher ( Cordis , USA ) stent . We hypothesise therefore potentially pliable structure Xience V stent associate great contact vessel wall . This may bear relative rate SSM , although large study show rate low Cypher Xience V stent . We believe OCT image SSM symmetry stent immediately angioplasty compliment conventional visual assessment may identify patient improvement stent balloon necessary . This study involve random allocation forty patient require coronary angioplasty one Cypher Xience V stent . The procedure perform usual manner indicate clinically include image stented artery segment OCT operator satisfy visual result angiography .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Presence coronary artery stenosis undergo percutaneous coronary intervention stenting ( PCI ) . Eligibility drug elute stent ( DES ) deployment . Stable unstable coronary syndrome presentation , include ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . Aged 1890 Contraindication use DES . Target lesion locate within previous stent ( stent restenosis ) . Sustained haemodynamic instability follow stent deployment ( Systolic BP 90â‰¤ mmHg sustain ventricular arrhythmia ) .</criteria>
