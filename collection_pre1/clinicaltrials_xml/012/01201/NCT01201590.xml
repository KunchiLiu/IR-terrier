	<brief_summary>The aim current study investigate ability antioxidant find cocoa ( 'flavanols ' ) increase body 's sensitivity hormone insulin . 32 overweight mildly obese woman , otherwise healthy , recruit . Subjects attend laboratory 3 occasion fast midnight . The 1st visit medical screening , laboratory visit 2 3 separate 4 week , time subject consume cocoa drink ( contain either high low amount flavanols ) twice day . Subjects record food intake 3-days visit 2 week 3 consuming cocoa . They also eat diet standard macronutrient composition 3 day visit 2 3 . During 5 hour laboratory visit , subject scan ass body composition use low-dose x-ray machine ( Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ; DEXA ) , insulin sensitivity measure use 3 hour hyperinsulinemic , euglycaemic Clamp .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Cocoa Flavanols Insulin Resistance 'At-risk ' Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background ; Overweight mild obesity associate insulin resistance mild elevation lipid risk factor usually sufficiently abnormal merit treatment . Such people encourage lose weight reduce risk progress type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease , clearly potential role dietary modification maximize potential benefit weight loss . Cocoa flavanols ( CF ) know vascular effect might enhance substrate delivery metabolically active tissue , thus improve insulin sensitivity . Aims ; This randomize , double blind , placebo control , parallel design study aim investigate long term effect CF intake insulin sensitivity . It hypothesize study otherwise healthy overweight mildly obese subject , evidence fast insulin resistance , would show whether potential benefit CF 'at risk ' population . Experimental protocol method ; 32 overweight obese woman ( Body Mass Index 27-35 ) , otherwise healthy , recruit onto study . They attend 'David Greenfield Human Physiology ' laboratory 3 convenient morning , follow overnight fast . The 1st visit medical screening involve sign consent form , complete medical screen food frequency questionnaire , height , weight , hip/waist circumference measurement take 10ml sample blood take routine analysis . Subjects ask complete 3-day diet diary macronutrient assessment consume diet provide 50 % energy carbohydrate 3 day prior 2nd laboratory visit . This 2nd visit involve DEXA body composition scan 3-hour hyperinsulinaemic , euglycaemic glucose clamp . Starting follow morning , subject consume cocoa drink ( contain either 450mg 25mg CF ) twice day 28 day . A 3-day diet diary macronutrient assessment record week 3 take cocoa standardize diet consume 3 day prior final laboratory visit , . This 3rd visit identical visit 2 occur immediately 28days take cocoa . Measurable end point Insulin sensitivity 'M ' value ( mg glucose disposal blood/kg body weight.min ) , Respiratory exchange ratio , Resting metabolic rate , Homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) Body composition ( DEXA ) Macronutrient composition diet intervention period</detailed_description>
