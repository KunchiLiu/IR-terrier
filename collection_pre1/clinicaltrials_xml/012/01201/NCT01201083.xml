Specific Aim 2 : Determine predictor transmission risk within partnership recently HIV infect men partner , use partnership unit analysis . Specific Aim 3 : Quantify long-term population-level impact voluntary behavior change men recent HIV infection , use dynamic mathematical modeling integrates data behavior change current estimate temporal infectiousness pattern . The investigator also determine whether frequent test and/or development test earlier sensitivity may significant impact epidemic .

	<brief_title>Study Recently HIV Infected Men Transmission Behaviors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People recently become infected HIV often high level virus may highly infectious . If sex ( especially anal intercourse ) without condom soon infect HIV , great chance may transmit virus others . When learn HIV infection , men change sexual behavior infect partner ( ) HIV .

This study look likely HIV infection spread among partner type time recently HIV-infected men partner . The study compare behavior recently HIV infect men long-term HIV infection HIV infection . It allow study sexual partnership actively recruit sexual partner . We also focus role drug use , especially methamphetamine change behavior time . We especially look different sex partner affect one 's drug use increase decrease HIV transmission . The study enroll 150 recently HIV-infected men sex men follow year . In addition , 6 sexual partner recently HIV infect individual recruit followed year . Some sexual partner HIV negative HIV positive . We use HIV status compare behavior time group partner status partner different status . The result use special formula allow well understanding behavior change men recent HIV infection . This new information key design new way target risk reduction recently HIV-infected men .</detailed_description>
