	<brief_summary>Acoustic Neuromas ( otherwise know Vestibular Schwannoma -VS ) benign tumor grow hear nerve cause progressive hearing loss compression vital brain structure even death continue . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy Nilotinib treatment patient progress VS . Secondary objective study evaluate toxicity profile , quality life symptom management Nilotinib treatment patient progress VS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Nilotinib Growing Vestibular Schwannomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>UHN laboratory demonstrate target Imatinib ( c-Kit PDGFR-α PDGFR-ß ) overexpressed activate sporadic NF2 VS.It also show pre-clinically Imatinib induce reduction proliferation cell viability , increase apoptosis , HEI-193 human NF2-null VS cells.Nilotinib new generation RTK inhibitor , similar target profile Imatinib . It design modify Imatinib molecule62 , 30-fold increase potency compare IImatinib43 . In clinical study patient CML GIST resistant Imatinib , Nilotinib demonstrate efficacy minimal toxicity . Nilotinib ( Tasigna® , code number AMN107 ) first approve 2007 use Philadelphia chromosome positive CML chronic accelerate phase patient resistant intolerant prior therapy . Thus make Nilotinib ideal drug study understanding benefit VS patient .</detailed_description>
