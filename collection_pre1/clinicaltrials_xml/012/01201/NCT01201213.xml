	<detailed_description>Despite 40 year epidural analgesia , consensus still exist regard best local anaesthetic best technique provision pain relief early labour . Two new local anaesthetic , levobupivacaine ropivacaine , recently introduce clinical practice show reduction cardiovascular cerebrovascular toxicity several small animal , large animal human volunteer study . Evidence improve safety study suggest new local anaesthetic use surgical anaesthesia , caesarean section , limb block , large volume , high concentration local anaesthetic require , risk toxicity high . In contrast , use levobupivacaine ropivacaine small dos analgesia labour remain controversial , bupivacaine remain intrathecal extradural local anaesthetic choice many obstetric unit . A change bupivacaine one new drug analgesia labour would require evidence document distinct advantage one new local anaesthetic provide equivalent pain relief , less side effect . Until , intrathecal epidural study investigate efficacy bupivacaine , levobupivacaine ropivacaine obstetric anaesthesia focus comparison % weight/volume ( % w/v ) solution . However , close scrutiny chemical composition local anaesthetic % w/v show mark difference molar concentration . The reason difference molar concentration two-fold . Levobupivacaine present commercially base hydrochloride therefore 12.7 % molecule equivalent concentration bupivacaine . In addition , ropivacaine small molecular weight either drug thus 4.5 % molecule bupivacaine 8.4 % less molecules levobupivacaine . Although molar difference drug relatively slight , small reduction molar concentration may provide similiar pain relief , result large reduction side effect due shape position efficacy side effect dose response curve . Comparative study three drug inconclusive . Intrathecal study show potency hierarchy bupivacaine &gt; levobupivacaine &gt; ropivacaine , equivalent potency levobupivacaine ropivacaine inject opioid , sufentanil . Epidural study also show potency levobupivacaine equivalent great ropivacaine , , combine sufentanil `` equipotent dos '' , show long duration analgesia bupivacaine . Use % w/v solution , addition opioids , pre-study assumption `` equipotency '' variable definition pain relief serve confuse issue local anaesthetic potency definite conclusion exist whether drug display advantage give either intrathecal epidural route . A second controversy concern mode drug administration . Although epidural analgesia popular Scotland initiate pain relief labour , major centre South England , Europe North America use combine technique spinal follow epidural analgesia ( CSE ) . The principal advantage quicker pain relief , rapid onset action may associate hypotension , motor block technical failure . A need exist define best local anaesthetic technique pain relief early labour . We suggest calculate molar ED50 bupivacaine , levobupivacine ropivacaine give intrathecal ( CSE ) epidural route would provide valid comparison pain relieve property three drug , reason assessment side effect could make . Thus , aim compare molar concentration bupivacaine , levobupivacaine ropivacaine inject intrathecal epidural space pain relief first stage labour , allow rational , molar comparison intrathecal epidural efficacy three drug , thus provide meaningful side effect profile . Only informed decision make regard best practice . Study design Phase IV , single centre , randomise , single-blind study pain relief early labour . Primary objective To determine median effective concentration bupivacaine , levobupivacaine ropivacaine intrathecal extradural injection pain relief first stage labour . Secondary objective To chart derive dose response curve bupivacaine , levobupivacaine ropivacaine intrathecal extradural injection Determine intrathecal / epidural potency ratio drug To measure degree motor block use Bromage Straight Leg Raising scale To measure side effect hypotension , nausea vomit To measure mode delivery fetal outcome Number type patient 162 patient request pain epidural relief early labour Recruitment allocation All patient present ante natal clinic schedule caesarean section approach recruitement study .

Inclusion criterion - The patient age &gt; 18 year - The patient early labour ≤ 5cm cervical dilitation - The patient ASA Grade I - II - The patient provide write informed consent participate trial prior surgery . Exclusion criterion - The patient know chronic medical condition regular medication require - The patient receive investigational drug within 90 day prior study schedule receive one study period . - The patient schedule caesarean section - The patient receive opioids last 4 hour - The patient evidence alcohol drug abuse - There evidence obstetric complication - The fetus show sign intrauterine growth retardation - The patient finding pre-study evaluation ( e.g . laboratory result , medical history , physical examination , ECG ) clinically significant investigator 's opinion exclude entry study . Intervention Following informed write consent , patient randomise six group : Patients , ward staff primary investigator blind study drug . Study drug prepare accord Ninewells Hospital Department Pharmacy guideline preparation drug clinical study . All study preparation cod equal chance receive one six infusion . All patient receive : - Size 16g intravenous cannula - Hartmann 's solution 500ml infuse 100ml h-1 - Epidural analgesia intrathecal analgesia ( CSE ) Dr Bhagya Munishankar order standardise intervention 3ml intrathecal start mass 10 µmol bupivacaine , levobupivacaine ropivacaine combine spinal-epidural analgesia ( CSE ) technique ( group A , B , C ) . 20 ml epidural start mass 50 µmol bupivacaine , levobupivacaine ropivacaine ( group D , E , F ) , Intrathecal saline placebo use intrathecal injection influence subsequent epidural spread increase risk hypotension . Assessments The primary pain assessment 100mm Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . The VAS perform pre-epidural , 5 minute interval epidural insertion 30 minute , every 5 minute 15 minute `` unsuccessful '' patient highlight . Three response epidural analgesia chart . 1 . Successful `` Excellent '' pain relief ≤ 10 mm time within 30 min epidural insertion 2 . Unsuccessful `` Good reasonable '' pain relief &gt; 10mm time within 30 min epidural insertion , ≤ 10 mm within 45min rescue injection 10ml 0.25 % bupivacaine 3 . Technical failure &gt; 10mm time within 30 min epidural insertion , still &gt; 10 mm within 45min despite rescue injection 10ml 0.25 % bupivacaine Three decision make base response : Response 1 . `` Excellent '' pain relief . Next patient receives : 1 mmol less intrathecal 5 mmol less epidural local anaesthetic 2 . `` Good reasonable '' pain relief . Next patient receives : 1 mmol intrathecal 5 mmol epidural local anaesthetic 3 . Technical failure Next patient receive mass drug Concomitant Medication Additional analgesia allow accordance protocol . The patient allow take present analgesic medication 12 hour preoperatively . Opiate-containing medication ( include codeine contain combination ) allow less 4 hour pre-study . Statistical analysis Data analysis proceed accord CONSORT guideline randomise controlled trial . The first stage analysis use descriptive statistic describe recruit individual relation eligible , investigate comparability trial arm baseline . The primary analysis intention-to-treat comparison two group primary secondary outcome . The primary outcome present EC50 confidence interval . Categorical data present number % event . Justification sample size Two-way analysis 6 group . At first sight give possible 15 comparison ! However maximum number logical comparison within effect reduce 6 threshold P value significance P &lt; 0.05 level P=0.0085 The coefficient variation isobole study approximately 20 % . The coefficient variation ( COV ) Capogna intrathecal MLAD range 15 % 18 % . So detect nominal 30 % difference potency , need N=27 per group up-down design 90 % power . Ethical Considerations : This study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki ICH Guidelines Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) .
