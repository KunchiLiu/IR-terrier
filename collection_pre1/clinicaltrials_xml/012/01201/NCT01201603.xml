	<brief_summary>The aim study primarily investigate ability antioxidant find orange juice ( OJ ) increase body 's sensitivity hormone insulin . Overweight mildly obese woman , otherwise healthy , recruit . The time commitment subject ~14wks . Subjects attend laboratory 5 occasion fast midnight . The 1st medical screening . Laboratory visit 2 &amp; 5 take ~5hrs separate 3 month , time subject consume 250ml orange drink ( either OJ orange flavour control drink ) day . During visit 2 &amp; 5 , subject scan ass % body fat use low-dose x-ray machine , insulin sensitivity measure use technique call 'Glucose Clamp ' . During 3hr glucose clamp , subject receive infusion hormone insulin glucose solution directly blood stream , insulin sensitivity determine amount glucose require maintain blood glucose normal level . In addition , small sample fat tissue ( size haricot bean ) take underneath skin belly . Subjects record food intake 3-days week 3 , 7 11 consuming drink , come lab visit 3 &amp; 4 week 4 &amp; 8 . Laboratory visit 3 &amp; 4 repeat measurement take 1st ( screen ) visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Orange Juice Insulin Sensitivity Plasma Lipids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Overweight mild obesity associate insulin resistance mild elevation lipid risk factor usually sufficiently abnormal merit treatment . Such people encourage lose weight reduce risk progress type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease , clearly potential role dietary modification maximize potential benefit weight loss . Flavonoids known vascular effect might enhance substrate delivery metabolically active tissue , thus improve insulin sensitivity . There many different dietary source flavonoid , fruit apple , berry citrus rich source . However , researcher express concern high dietary intake 100 % juice may contribute development insulin resistance , obesity Metabolic Syndrome ( Bazzano , Li et al . 2008 ) , although universally accept ( Fujioka , Greenway et al . 2006 ; O'Neil Nicklas 2008 ) . To date , study investigate effect citrus fruit index cardio-metabolic health people presently healthy risk develop feature Metabolic Syndrome . Aims : To investigate effect orange juice ( OJ ) intake insulin sensitivity , appetite hormone , blood pressure plasma lipid . In addition aim investigate gene expression change associate OJ consumption , particular adipose tissue . Experimental protocol method : Overweight obese woman ( BMI 27-35 ) , otherwise healthy , recruit onto study . They attend 'David Greenfield Human Physiology ' laboratory 5 convenient morning , follow overnight fast . The 1st visit medical screening involve sign consent form , complete medical screening , food frequency activity questionnaire , height , weight , hip/waist circumference measurement take sample blood take CBC , urea , electrolyte , LFT , TFT , glucose insulin analysis . Subjects ask complete 3-day diet diary macronutrient assessment consume diet provide 50 % energy carbohydrate 3 day prior 2nd laboratory visit . This 2nd visit involve DEXA body composition scan , adipose tissue biopsy 3-hr hyperinsulinemic , euglycemic glucose clamp . Starting follow morning , subject consume orange drink ( either OJ carbohydrate match orange flavour drink ) day 12 wks . A 3-day diet diary macronutrient assessment record wks 3,7and 11 take drink , measurement make screen repeat visit 3 4 take place week 4 8 . A standardized diet consume 3 day prior final laboratory visit , . This 5th visit identical visit 2 .</detailed_description>
