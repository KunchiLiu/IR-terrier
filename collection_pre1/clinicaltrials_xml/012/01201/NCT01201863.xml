	<detailed_description>This study assess hormonal status men admission inpatient TBI rehabilitation program . Eighty-eight Individuals low Testosterone ( T ) level randomize receive either physiologic T therapy placebo . Fifty-six Individuals sufficient level T follow second control group . All three group undergo serial assessment neurological function ( measure NIH Toolbox ) functional independence ( FIM ) correlate hormone level . Hormone level assess analysis blood sample draw participant time study screen two week interval total 7 blood draw 12 week study period . Demographics , injury characteristic , concomitant medication usage adverse event document medical record review . Statistical analysis perform test study hypothesis . Findings disseminate professional consumer conference peer-reviewed journal consumer-based publication . Results also make available Craig Hospital website via summary report Colorado TBI Trust Fund Research Program . If T therapy find effective , finding use preliminary data grant proposal multi-center trial .</detailed_description>
