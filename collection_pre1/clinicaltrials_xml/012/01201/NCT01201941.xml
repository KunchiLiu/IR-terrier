	<brief_summary>The objective study compare effect web-based laboratory information system ( e-Chasqui ) network health establishment access e-Chasqui ( intervention group ) network health establishment without access e-Chasqui ( control group ) . The specific aim : 1 . To compare `` laboratory turn-around-time '' ( date culture drug susceptibility test ( DST ) result obtain date result obtain health center ) sample pertain health establishment intervention versus control group . 2 . To compare `` clinical turn-around-time '' ( date DST result obtain date patient evaluate physician possession result ) among multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) patient pertain health establishment intervention versus control group . 3 . To compare laboratory reporting error ( define incorrect smear , culture , DST result ) health establishment intervention versus control group . 4 . To qualitatively assess acceptability usability e-Chasqui among user health establishment access system . The investigator aim test follow hypothesis : 1 . The laboratory turn-around-time health establishment e-Chasqui access small establishment without e-Chasqui access . 2 . The clinical turn-around-time patient pertain health establishment e-Chasqui access small patient establishment without e-Chasqui access . 3 . Health establishments e-Chasqui access few error compare without e-Chasqui access . 4 . Factors associate acceptability usability e-Chasqui system user identify .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Operational Assessment Laboratory Information System MDR-TB Lima , Peru</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delays start patient multi-drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) appropriate medication treatment lead worsen patient outcome increase risk transmission . In Peru , National Tuberculosis Program ( NTP ) provide treatment patient MDR-TB since 1996 , cure rate range 48 % 83 % . Nonetheless , significant delay exist diagnosis MDR case timely treatment initiation , particular since MDR-TB treatment scale national level . Our preliminary work find average turn-around-time ( TAT ) request DST prescription appropriate treatment 148 day ( 4.9 month ) . An information system could use virtually eliminate part delay : time communicate result different institution . In 2001 develop deploy web base medical record system , PIH-EMR , assist clinical management MDR-TB patient . This system include substantial set data entry analysis tool laboratory result include sputum smear , culture DSTs . Over last six month PIH-EMR modify support decentralization DSTs regional laboratory . This laboratory component PIH-EMR , term `` e-Chasqui , '' permit web-based entry culture DST result regional central laboratory perform test . In addition , system include application assess quality control , generate aggregate report , notify health center new result contaminate sample , track enrol patient status pending laboratory test . The NTP National Reference Laboratory ( NRL ) agree integrate e-Chasqui current management patient risk MDR-TB two region , effective , provide national network laboratory perform DST . Because intensive initial demand resource training , implementation information system occur stage ( part A B study ) . Broadly put , study provide data whether use information system show improve quality patient care . More specifically , assess impact e-Chasqui reduce reporting delay laboratory data error , improve patient outcomes . This prospective observational control study compare effect web-based laboratory information system ( e-Chasqui ) network health establishment e-Chasqui access ( intervention group ) compare network health establishment without e-Chasqui access ( control group ) . The data collect overarching study `` Operational Assessment Diagnostic Methods MDR-TB Lima , Peru . '' The study plan two part : Part A simultaneous control study occur `` transition '' period compare endpoint health establishment e-Chasqui access match health establishment without e-Chasqui access . Part B historical control study compare endpoint establishment gain initial e-Chasqui access , ( historical control ) ( intervention ) implementation . Data source include : patient chart , interview health provider confirm clarify accuracy data patient chart , microbiology registry local , regional national laboratory , information system database . The total number subject enrol study-wide 1849 .</detailed_description>
