	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , dose-escalation study characterize safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic profile , pharmacodynamic profile , clinical activity oral PI3K inhibitor GSK2126458 oral MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 dose combination subject advance solid tumor . The study conduct 2 part , Part 1 dose escalation phase Part 2 tumor specific cohort expansion . A continuous daily dose schedule utilize initially investigational product . The frequency schedule dosing may adjust base emerge safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics data . Once recommended regimen characterize Part 1 , may evaluate Part 2 . More one regimen ( dose schedule ) may evaluate Part 2 , base finding Part 1 . Subjects eligible enrollment Part 2 solid tumor genetic profile likely benefit MEK PI3K pathway inhibition .</detailed_description>
