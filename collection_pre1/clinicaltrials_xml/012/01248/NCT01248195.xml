	<detailed_description>Despite nearly fifty year pharmacological psychosocial research , overall prognosis schizophrenia improve marginally . While efficacy antipsychotic medication generally uncontested , overall functional impact modest . In order improve unsatisfactory result , study aim optimize current treatment schizophrenia explore novel therapeutic option schizophrenia . The study comprise medication intervention component , psychosocial intervention component , biological predictor component MRI component . MRI assessment perform baseline , use determine whether potential organic cause psychotic symptom present , test prospective value assessment subsequent treatment response . MRI assessments healthy volunteer include test deviation patient ' assessment ; volunteer participate protocol procedure . The medication intervention component comprise first 4-week phase amisulpride treatment . Non-responders subsequently randomise 6-week double blind phase either amisulpride olanzapine . Patients classify non-responders end phase , 12-week open label treatment clozapine initiate . Patients classify responder phase I , II III , drop out non-responders end phase III flow psychosocial intervention component study . During part , several intervention test , aim increase treatment compliance keep patient medication 've respond well . Through biological predictor component , determine whether glutamatergic marker predict response first second line treatment , empirical combination pharmacogenetic , proteomics- metabolomic marker provide clinical valuable predictive value .</detailed_description>
