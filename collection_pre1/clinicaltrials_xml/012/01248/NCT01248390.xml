	<brief_summary>The purpose research see whether add new therapy help people brain injury focus good think clearly . You ask participate research study brain injury . If decide volunteer , study six months.As participant , randomly assign one 2 treatment plan . Randomization process like flip coin mean chance assign either plan . One group give experimental therapy use metronome one hour day , three time week . A metronome device produce steady beat . You need keep time metronome several different movement . On beat , give information sound computer screen whether early late far beat . The tempo beat 54 beat per minute , need process feedback information quickly adjust speed match beat . The various movement include thing like clap hand , tap toe , alternate different similar movement . It hop metronome help subject concentrate well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>`` Interactive Metronome Technology Blast-Related Traumatic Brain Injury ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design study randomize , control trial Interactive Metronome ( IM ) treatment compare treatment usual patient moderate mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) due blast . The study conduct Evans Army Community Hospital Fort Carson , Colorado . Patients randomize IM training , treatment usual/wait-list control condition . Patients randomize receive IM training complete 15 session consist approximately 2000 repetition . Patients randomize treatment usual offer opportunity receive IM training follow conclusion six month study period . Outcome assessment focus phase lag coherence electroencephalogram ( EEG ) activity , electrophysiological measure cortical connectivity . Primary outcome also include attention memory functioning , measure prior start treatment , one week follow end treatment 6 month treatment end . Interactive Metronome ( IM ) technology behavioral feedback operant conditioning system.15 In biofeedback , physiological information display patient IM information patient 's behavioral response provide . Below investigator provide detailed description behavioral task give idea program 's complexity operation . IM technology take advantage discuss factor relate neuroplastic process integrate single set task design encourage integrated neuroplastic activity cognitively demand circumstance . The computerized feedback reliable , consistent , timely , directly correlate motor output . The feedback also present rich cognitive sensory environment combine instantaneous delivery simultaneous auditory visual feedback follow motor response . This information aid preparation upcoming behavioral response . All feedback processing adjustment behavioral response must occur second ( 1.111 second ) default tempo IM training 54 beat per minute . This place considerable temporal demand upon attentional , integration , decision making , inhibitory , motor output operator cortex , thereby increase process speed efficiency course training .</detailed_description>
