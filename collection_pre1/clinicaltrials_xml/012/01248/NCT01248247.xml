	<brief_summary>Different people different biomarkers ( chemical `` marker '' blood may relate reaction study drug ) . If researcher know biomarkers receive treatment , may able prescribe treatment well suit body 's specific need . The goal clinical research study learn drug drug combination base biomarkers help control NSCLC . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BATTLE-2 Program : A Biomarker-Integrated Targeted Therapy Study Previously Treated Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Erlotinib hydrochloride , MK-2206 , AZD6244 , Sorafenib target therapy . Targeted therapy type drug block growth cancer cell interfere specific target molecule need tumor growth , rather simply interfere rapidly divide cell ( example traditional chemotherapy ) . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 4 group : - If Group 1 , take erlotinib alone . - If Group 2 , take erlotinib MK-2206 . - If Group 3 , take AZD6244 MK-2206 . - If Group 4 , take sorafenib alone . The group assign computer . The result screen test use determine ( may limit ) 4 group may eligible assign . Your likelihood 1 group another may also affect well treatment do earlier study participant . Your study doctor tell group assign . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 28 day . - If Group 1 , take erlotinib hydrochloride mouth 1 time every day . - If Group 2 , take MK-2206 mouth 1 time every week . You take erlotinib hydrochloride mouth 1 time every day . - If Group 3 , take MK-2206 mouth 1 time per week . You take AZD6244 mouth 1 time every day . - If Group 4 , take sorafenib mouth 2 time every day . If take erlotinib hydrochloride ( Groups 1 2 ) , take tablet morning . You take drug 1 hour 2 hour meal , 7 ounce water . If forget take dose , last miss dose take soon remember , long least 12 hour next dose . The next day , take schedule dose usual time . You try vomit least 30 minute take drug . If feel nauseate take erlotinib , take anti-nausea drug . You may take extra dose erlotinib vomit within 30 minute take tablet . If Group 2 , take MK-2206 time week 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You must take MK-2206 least 2 hour least 2 hour food meal . You make missed dos . If Group 3 , take MK-2206 time week 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You must take MK-2206 least 2 hour least 2 hour eat . You make missed dos . If take AZD6244 ( Group 3 ) , take study drug morning eat drink anything . You eat breakfast 1 hour take dose . If take sorafenib , must take dos 12 hour apart . You take 2 tablet morning , even . Sorafenib take 1 cup water empty stomach ( either 1 hour meal 2 hour meal ) . If feel nauseate take medication , anti-nausea medication use . If miss dose , skip take next schedule dose right time . Your medication store room temperature . Study Visits : The study visit schedule describe . In certain case , permission doctor , study visit may occur 7 day earlier later describe . On Day 1 cycle : - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need , may blood test often . On Day 1 every odd-numbered cycle ( Cycles 3 , 5 , 7 , ) : - You CT scan and/or MRI chest ( abdomen doctor think need ) check status disease . - You chest x-ray . - MRI brain ( doctor think need ) Additional Tests Group 2 : During screen , Day 1 Cycle 2 , end-of study visit , eye exam . On Day 1 Cycle 1 ECG take study medication 4 hour take study medication . Additional Tests Group 3 - During screening , Day 1 Cycle 2 , end-of study visit , eye exam . - During Cycle 2 ( Week 6 study drug ) , Day 1 Cycle 4 , every 3 month , multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan and/or echocardiogram check heart function . You test often doctor think need . - On Day 1 Cycle 1 ECG take study medication 4 hour take study medication . Length Study : You may continue take study drug ( ) long benefit . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : When go study reason , end-of-study . This visit may occur 7 day earlier later . The following test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You CT scan and/or MRI chest ( abdomen doctor think need ) check status disease . - You chest x-ray . - You ECG ( Group 3 ) . Follow-Up : You follow-up evaluation perform 4 week Â± 7 day therapy discontinue . This evaluation may visit contact phone research personnel . If Group 3 , MUGA scan and/or echocardiogram check heart function . You call every 3 month 3 year ask cancer treatment may receive . This phone call take 10 minute . This investigational study . Erlotinib FDA approve commercially available treatment NSCLC gotten bad . Sorafenib approve renal cell cancer hepatocellular carcinoma . Sorafenib also also evaluate unselected advanced patient NSCLC alone chemotherapy first-time treatment patient . MK-2206 , AZD6244 FDA-approved commercially available . At time , use research . Up 450 patient take part multicenter study . Approximately 350 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
