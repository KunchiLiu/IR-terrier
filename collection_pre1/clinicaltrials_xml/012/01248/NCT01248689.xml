	<detailed_description>Introduction One important goal anesthetic management ocular surgery provide adequate control intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . An increase IOP may catastrophic patient glaucoma penetrate open-eye injury . Accurate assessment IOP particularly important infant child definite suspect glaucoma undergoing examination anesthesia ( EUA ) . There ongoing debate effect anesthetic agent IOP . Anesthetic regimens surgical field commonly consist short-acting anesthetic agent , propofol sevoflurane , usually combine short-acting analgesic , remifentanil [ 1-3 ] . Both propofol sevoflurane know reduce IOP [ 4-7 ] . Previous study compare two anesthetic protocol order determine provide superior control IOP . Propofol produce significantly low IOP measurement compare sevoflurane ( combine remifentanil ) , cataract surgery [ 8 ] , whereas non-ophthalmic surgery propofol sevoflurane cause comparable decrease IOP [ 9 ] . Sevoflurane , inhalational anesthetic , rapid onset action , fast recovery time low incidence report side effect pediatric patient [ 10 ] , also suitable inhalation induction irritate airway [ 3 ] . During pediatric ocular surgery , inspire sevoflurane concentration normally maximal induction anesthesia ( approximately end-tidal concentration 7 % ) , thereafter reduce discontinue achieve end-tidal sevoflurane concentration &lt; 0.1 % completion skin closure . In time point inhale end-tidal concentration gradually decrease may impact IOP could affect conduct surgery . A prospective randomize clinical trial compare effect ketamine sevoflurane IOP eight minute induction anesthesia ( 2-minute interval ) child suspect diagnosed glaucoma undergo EUA [ 5 ] . During 8 minute IOP decrease significantly sevoflurane group . This finding contradict claim measurement immediately induction relatively unaffected anesthetic , suggest variation sevoflurane concentration affect IOP . To end data literature support disprove finding . Study Objective To assess effect different end-tidal sevoflurane concentration IOP child healthy eye undergo extraocular procedure , i.e. , strabismus correction tear duct probe irrigation . Study hypothesis We believe variation end-tidal sevoflurane concentration significant effect IOP healthy eye . Study design This prospective randomize trial 21 child undergo ocular surgery . Informed consent first obtain parent legal guardian . After induction anesthesia onset surgery , IOP measure eye four different concentration inhale sevoflurane . Intra-operative anesthetic management Anesthetic management perform trained pediatric anesthesiologist . All patient premedicated 0.5 mg/kg ( 15 mg ) midazolam P.O . 30min surgery . No significant change IOP report midazolam [ 11 ] . Induction anesthesia carry sevoflurane 8 % 100 % oxygen carrier gas . After induction anesthesia , laryngeal mask insert , sevoflurane end-tidal concentration adjust accord study protocol assign group ( see `` patient allocation assessment '' ) . No systemic anesthetic agent use IOP measurement . IOP measurement perform induction anesthesia . Thereafter , maintenance anesthesia carry either spontaneous ventilation one two minimal alveolar concentration sevoflurane ( 2 4 % ) 100 % oxygen , mechanical ventilation , commonly use pediatric surgery . Standardized intraoperative monitoring employ subject anesthesiologist . Intra-operative surgical management Routine strabismus correction tear duct probe irrigation procedure perform subject , describe elsewhere [ 12 ] . Patient allocation assessment Consented patient randomly ( mean computer-generated assignment random number ) allocate one three group ( n=7 group ) . In group IOP measure record four different predetermine end-tidal sevoflurane concentration : 7 % , 5 % , 2 % , 0.5 % . The order concentration differ group , eliminate effect exposure time : 1 . 7 % , 5 % , 2 % , 0.5 % 2 . 7 % , 2 % , 5 % , 0.5 % 3 . 7 % , 0.5 % , 5 % , 2 % IOP measure ophthalmologist via TonoPen XL Schioz device . Measurements take eye alternatively three consecutive reading , abovementioned concentration . There know risk IOP reading . At time , anesthesiologist record systolic diastolic blood pressure ( SBP , DBP ) heart rate ( HR ) , End Tidal CO2 , via iMDsoft software . In addition , collect demographic data ( e.g. , age , gender , weight ) patient . Routine post operative follow perform .</detailed_description>
