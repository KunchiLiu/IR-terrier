	<brief_summary>Food product derive cereal grain constitute major part daily diet many Americans . For example , typical Chinese American eats rice 9.5 time week average . However , food derive refined grain . During refine process grain strip bran germ result depletion several biologically active constituent include fiber , anti-oxidants , phytoestrogens mineral . From observational study evidence protective effect whole-grain food regard development type 2 diabetes . More recently , high intake whole grain also associate decrease insulin resistance - risk factor relate development type 2 diabetes . In randomized study investigator plan replicate beneficial effect improve insulin sensitivity patient pre-diabetes go step explore potential mechanism benefit may occur . The investigator assess effect consume whole-grain-rich diet level advance glycation endproducts ( AGE ) , RAGE ( receptor AGE ) marker inflammation oxidative stress - show play important role pathogenesis diabetes mellitus . The investigator also look correlation level marker insulin sensitivity identify potential mechanism pathogenesis .</brief_summary>
