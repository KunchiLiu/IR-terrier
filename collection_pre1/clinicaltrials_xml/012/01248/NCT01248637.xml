	<brief_title>Study Intratumoral Hypoxia Using Pre-operative Administration Pimonidazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intratumoral hypoxia ( low oxygen concentration pO2 ) occur oxygen consumption exceed delivery vascular system . Hypoxia associate adverse patient outcome many human cancer association hypothesize due combination treatment resistance aggressive tumor biology . The study hypoxia also important new cancer drug develop specifically active cancer cell area tumor low oxygen level . study involve administer hypoxia probe pimonidazole hydrochloride patient prior resection pancreatic adenocarcinoma evaluate extent , molecular context clinical relevance hypoxia clinical pancreatic cancer sample subsequently derive primary xenograft tumor . We propose accrual patient 5-year period evaluate hypoxia within 100 clinical tumor specimens correspond primary xenograft tumour available . The complementary technique wide-field multicolor fluorescence image analysis microscopy high level flow cytometry use identify potential relationship intratumoral hypoxia cell proliferation , differentiation , expression putative cancer stem cell marker .</detailed_description>
