	<brief_summary>This research do know dexamethasone prevent pain flare ( pain temporarily get bad get good ) cause radiation use treat painful bone metastasis . Using dexamethasone prevent pain like studied people seem promising , clear decrease pain prevent pain flare happen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexamethasone v Placebo Prophylaxis Radiation-Induced Pain Flare Following Palliative Radiotherapy Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research show patient receive radiation therapy treat painful bone metastasis , 2 every 5 patient ( 40 % ) experience pain flare . The purpose study find whether pain flare prevent receive 8mg dexamethasone least one hour prior radiotherapy daily follow 4 day . To , half patient study get dexamethasone half receive placebo ( substance anything ) . Using placebo best way see new therapy effective clearly see potential side effect impact quality life .</detailed_description>
