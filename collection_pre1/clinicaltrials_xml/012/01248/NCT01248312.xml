	<brief_summary>Hypercapnea condition much carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) blood . Carbon dioxide gaseous product body 's metabolism normally expel lung ( breathe ) . Hypoventilation ( respiratory depression ) occur ventilation inadequate perform need gas exchange ; therefore result decrease level oxygen increase level carbon dioxide blood . It cause increase concentration carbon dioxide respiratory acidosis . Obesity multi-system disorder , particularly involve respiratory ( lungs/breathing ) cardiovascular ( heart/vessel ) system . Obesity increase risk surgical anesthetic complication , follow surgery . Bariatric ( weight loss ) surgery become common procedure among morbidly obese ( 100 lb normal weight ) , recent study highlight long-term health implication surgical weight reduction , include decrease risk hypertension ( high blood pressure ) diabetes ( increased sugar blood ) . Obese patient increase risk sleep apnea ( stop breathing asleep ) hypoventilation even without surgery , risk increase follow administration medication typically give major surgical procedure . Hypoventilation lead hypercapnea , sedation ( sleepiness ) , acidosis ( blood imbalance ) , result respiratory compromise ( breathe problem ) cardiac morbidity ( heart problem ) well risks inherent re-intubating ( need breathe tube place lung ) obese.Monitoring hypoventilation difficult . Quantitative capnography ( measure carbon dioxide ) appropriate intubate patient ( ventilator - breathe tube ) , pulse oximetry ( clip finger measure oxygen level ) adequately detect hypoventilation patient receive supplemental ( additional ) oxygen . Serial arterial blood gas ( blood take artery measure oxygen level blood ) measurement expensive , time-consuming , painful . Continuous respiratory rate monitoring possible , consider gold standard apnea detection ( see stop breathe ) , yet seldom use . As result limitation , currently simple , cost-effective , reliable mean detect hypoventilation patient population either recovery room inpatient unit . Transcutaneous ( across skin ) pCO2 ( t-pCO2 ) monitoring validate reliable reproducible mean measure pCO2 newborn baby , recently also use adult , primarily ICU ( intensive care unit ) setting . When compare standard end-tidal CO2 measurement , t-pCO2 correlate well pCO2 intraoperative period thin obese patient . SenTec , manufacturer device use measure t-pCO2 project . This study design detect incidence hypercapnea morbidly obese post-surgical bariatric patient postoperative period use SenTec t-pCO2 monitor . Objective : To determine incidence hypoventilation hypercapnea measure transcutaneous pCO2 monitor post-surgical bariatric patient compare thin control .</brief_summary>
