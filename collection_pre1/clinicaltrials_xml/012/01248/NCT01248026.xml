	<brief_summary>The role low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) pathogenesis cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) clinical benefit lower LDL-C high-risk patient well establish . The key contribution intestine whole body cholesterol homeostasis thus regulate plasma cholesterol concentration also recognize last year . It clear cholesterol homeostasis hence plasma LDL-C concentration maintain fine-tuned balance intestinal cholesterol absorption endogenous cholesterol synthesis . Cholesterol highly hydrophobic molecule reason , absorption almost entirely dependent solubilizing capacity bile acid micelle within intestine . Recent vitro study laboratory show buttermilk , unique by-product butter manufacture result churn cream , strong inhibitory effect cholesterol micelle solubility . This phenomenon likely due presence unique milk fat globule membrane ( MFGM ) fragment present buttermilk produce manufacturing dairy cream butter . Most work do far subject focused phospholipid purify MFGM , overlook complex entire MFGM mixture bioactive protein polar lipid find buttermilk . To best knowledge , study yet document impact whole buttermilk plasma cholesterol concentration human . The general objective research project investigate first time impact buttermilk plasma cholesterol risk factor CVD human . More specifically , propose investigate impact buttermilk consumption plasma LDL-C CVD risk factor well plasma surrogates cholesterol absorption synthesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose research undertaken double-blind randomize cross-over study participant subject 2 consecutive treatment 4 week , random order , consume 45g buttermilk macro- micronutrient match placebo . The treatment different content MFGM ( present buttermilk , absent placebo ) . Buttermilk placebo fully characterize formulate ready-to-use pouch , pouch contain 22.5 g artificially flavor product mixed fixed amount water consumption . Participants consume two pouch every day . Based 2500 kcal/day regimen , calculate placebo buttermilk formulation contribute approximately 200 kcal ( 5 % 10 % ) daily energy intake participant , ask maintain aspect nutritional habit constant throughout study . Fluctuations female hormone show influence metabolic variable . For reason , outcomes end dietary phase measure follicular phase menstrual cycle ( day 3 day 9 ) pre-menopausal woman . This another argument use 4-wk intervention , essentially correspond mean duration menstrual cycle woman . Pre-menopausal woman start first diet first week menstrual cycle .</detailed_description>
