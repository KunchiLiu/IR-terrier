	<brief_summary>Background : - Recent study show smolder multiple myeloma high risk progress multiple myeloma , aggressive type bone marrow cancer , within 5 year diagnosis . People smolder multiple myeloma abnormal blood test result show high level monoclonal protein ( M-protein ) blood plasma cell bone marrow . There currently know effective treatment prevent smolder multiple myeloma develop multiple myeloma , know test determine whether individual smolder multiple myeloma develop multiple myeloma . - Certain cell immune system , know natural killer ( NK ) cell , active multiple myeloma . The experimental drug anti-killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ( anti-KIR ) show help NK cell kill multiple myeloma cell . Researchers interested determine whether anti-KIR give individual smolder multiple myeloma improve abnormal blood test result . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness anti-KIR treatment abnormal blood test result related smolder multiple myeloma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose smolder multiple myeloma . Design : - Participants screen physical examination medical history , provide baseline blood , urine , bone marrow sample begin study drug . - Participants receive anti-KIR intravenously 1 hour , closely monitor 24 hour receive first dose . If serious side effect , participant receive five additional anti-KIR dos , one every month , total six treatment cycle . - Participants monthly visit provide additional blood urine sample , may additional bone marrow biopsy direct study researcher . - Participants followup visit every 3 6 month 5 year receive anti-KIR treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Anti-KIR Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Multiple myeloma ( MM ) incurable plasma cell neoplasm median survival 3-4 year . - Smoldering multiple myeloma ( SMM ) premalignant plasma cell disorder characterize monoclonal protein great equal 3 g/dL bone marrow plasma cell great equal 10 percent absence myeloma-related tissue impairment 51 percent progression MM 5 year . - Current recommendation endorse treatment SMM chemotherapy . - Transplanted Natural Killer ( NK ) Cells anti-myeloma activity . - Anti-KIR ( IPH2101 ) monoclonal antibody facilitate NK cell mediate kill myeloma cell block inhibitory receptor ( KIR ) NK cell . Objectives : - To assess response rate anti-KIR ( IPH2101 ) patient SMM - To evaluate toxicity anti-KIR ( IPH2101 ) patient SMM - To evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter biological activity anti-KIR ( IPH2101 ) Eligibility : - A confirmed diagnosis SMM - Age great equal 18 year - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status range 0-1 . - Without serious co-morbidity would interfere receipt anti-KIR ( IPH2101 ) Design : - Single-arm Phase II trial anti-KIR ( IPH2101 ) patient SMM . - All patient initial evaluation confirmation diagnosis . - Patients receive anti-KIR ( IPH2101 ) ( 1mg/kg ) every month 6 cycle . - Patients routine blood work serum protein electrophoresis ( SPEP ) immunofixation monthly . - Pre- post-treatment bone marrow biopsy obtain confirmation diagnosis correlative study . - Patients may donate cellular product tissue appropriate research purpose . - Optimal two-stage phase II design employ , initially enrol 9 patient . If 3 positive outcome , total 21 patient enrol study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis smolder multiple myeloma ( SMM ) make accordance clinical diagnostic criterion set forth International Myeloma Working Group . These criterion include : Serum Mprotein great equal 3 g/dl and/or bone marrow plasma cell great equal 10 percent Absence anemia : Hemoglobin great equal 10 g/dl Absence renal failure : calculated creatinine clearance ( accord modification diet renal disease ( MDRD ) ) great equal 40 ml/min ( alternatively base standard creatinine level criterion 2 mg/dl ) Absence hypercalcemia : Calcium le equal 10.5 mg/dl Absence lytic bone lesion ( skeletal survey ) The diagnosis confirm serum/urine protein electrophoresis , immunofixation lightchain assay ; well immunohistochemical analysis bone marrow biopsy . Age great equal 18 year . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Male female patient accepts able use recognize effective contraception ( oral contraceptive , intrauterine contraceptive device ( IUCD ) , barrier method contraception conjunction spermicidal jelly ) study four month follow final dose study drug relevant . The patient must competent sign inform consent form . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients diagnosis multiple myeloma ( MM ) clinical suspicion ongoing progression fullblown MM Patients without measurable disease define serum monoclonal protein ( Mprotein ) less 1 g/dL . Previous treatment proven potential impact myeloma cell proliferation survival ( include conventional chemotherapy , immunomodulatory drug ( IMiDs ) , proteasome inhibitor ) . Use investigational agent within last 3 month . Clinical laboratory value screen : Platelet level less 75 time 10^9/L Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) level less 1 time 10^9/L Bilirubin level great 1.5 upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) great 3.0 ULN ( grade 1 National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) ) Primary associate amyloidosis Known abnormal cardiac status follow : New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) stage III IV congestive heart failure Myocardial infarction within previous 6 month Symptomatic and/or treatmentrefractory cardiac arrhythmia . Patients control asymptomatic arrhythmia exclude study . Current active infectious disease positive serology : Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Severe type autoimmune disease define : One currently require previously require longterm systemic immunosuppressive immunomodulatory therapy ( include corticosteroid , administer systemic route ) And/or substantial probability cause irreversible injury tissue ( e.g . Hashimoto thyroiditis ) . And/or recent unstable , substantial risk progress cause severe complication ( e.g . Graves disease ) Enrollment non severe type autoimmunes disease require topical therapy , nonsteroidal inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) consider case case basis Principal Investigator .
