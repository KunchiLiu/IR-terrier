	<detailed_description>Lung carcinoma one fatal cancer world . The enormous fatality rate reflect limited chance cure , dismal overall 5-year survival rate approximately 14 % . The prognosis lung cancer depend largely early detection immediate treatment prior metastatic spread . For Stage 1 lung cancer 5-year survival rate high 70 % . These data suggest early detection surgical treatment would huge beneficial effect lung cancer population . We develop single arm observational study early detection lung cancer low dose CT scan high risk asymptomatic subject . A mainly non invasive algorithm management undetermined nodule design include low dose CT three month baseline nodule diameter 5 8 mm , PET scan nodule large 8 mm ( reduce antibiotic one month follow CT ) . Lesions increase diameter density positive nodule CT/PET send surgical biopsy ( videothoracoscopic approach prefer ) . Spirometry do subject prior CT scan evaluate correlation BPCO lung cancer .</detailed_description>
