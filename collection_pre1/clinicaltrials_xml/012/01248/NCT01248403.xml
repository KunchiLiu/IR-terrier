	<brief_summary>Adult patient gastric carcinoma progress initial treatment fluoropyrimidines-containing regimen treat paclitaxel plus RAD001 plus placebo . The hypothesis patient RAD001 significantly prolong overall survival compare patient treat paclitaxel alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double Blind Study Evaluating Paclitaxel With Without RAD001 Patients With Gastric Carcinoma After Prior Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , phase III two-arm multi-center study aim estimate relative efficacy combination RAD001 paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone second- , third- fourth-line treatment term hazard ratio overall survival patient gastric cancer relapse one treatment regimen contain fluoropyrimidine ( e.g. , 5-FU , S-1 , capecitabine 5-FU prodrugs derivative ) . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio total 240 patient per treatment arm . Randomization stratify accord performance status ( 0-1 versus 2 ) , prior taxan use ( yes vs. ) treatment line ( 2nd versus 3rd/4th line ) . Study treatment continue progression intolerable toxicity . Patients see baseline/screening , weekly paclitaxel administration safety assessment disease progression discontinuation trial therapy reason . Radiological tumor assessment perform every second cycle ( every 8 week ) earlier clinically indicate . Post-study follow-up complete every 8 week survival .</detailed_description>
