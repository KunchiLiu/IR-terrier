	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare stomach empty use 13C-Spirulina platensis breath test scintigraphy healthy subject subject dyspepsia . Subjects eat standard meal 2 scramble egg , slice wheat toast 8 ounce skim milk . The egg double label Technetium-99m ( 99mTc ) sulfur colloid 13C-Spirulina platensis . Scintigraphy diagnostic technique two-dimensional picture internal body tissue produce detection radiation emit radioactive substance administer body . The location standard meal digestive system measure image 99mTc sulfur colloid take periodic interval standard meal . The 99mTc Sulfur Colloid approve FDA use medical diagnostic procedure . Spirulina platensis blue - green algae , similar naturally occur spirulina sell health food store dietary supplement . The spirulina platensis label 13C stable isotope . 13C stable isotope label inherently safe 1.1 % carbon body food eat 13C . The presence 13C measure breath sample periodic interval standard meal . The FDA considers 13C-Spirulina platensis investigational purpose study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carbon-13 ( 13C ) -Spirulina Platensis Gastric Emptying Breath Test ( GEBT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study compare gastric empty assess modified 13C spirulina breath test scintigraphy 30 subject , i.e. , 15 healthy subject 15 dyspepsia . Gastric empty simultaneously assess method use dual-labeled meal . It anticipate gastric empty half-time ( t½ ) value base 13C breath excretion value compare gold standard , scintigraphy , `` true '' t½ value obtain . The aim study estimate factor necessary convert exhale 13C concentration gastric empty half-time , measure scintigraphy , healthy subject patient dyspepsia . For potential participant , screen visit conduct within 4 week prior study visit . During screen visit , informed consent obtain , physical exam conduct trained investigator . Participants free leave test site . A urine pregnancy test woman child-bearing potential complete within 48 hour prior exposure radiation . After overnight ( minimum 8 hour ) fast , participant return study center , time dual-label Gastric Emptying Test administer . A baseline breath sample collect duplicate subject blow straw collection tube . The test meal prepared personnel test site subject arrives . Step-by-step test meal preparation instruction provide GEBT kit . The patient consume test meal contain [ 13C ] -Spirulina 99mTc sulfur colloid 10 minute . Scintigraphic image acquisition obtain upon completion meal 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 240 minute time point . Breath sample collect baseline test meal start thereafter time schedule scintigraphic procedure . As cooked egg triturated stomach , pass pylorus intestine [ 13C ] -Spirulina platensis digest , absorb , metabolize give rise label carbon dioxide expire breath . Breath sample , collect test meal , ship overnight Advanced Breath Diagnostics analysis Gas Isotope Ratio Mass Spectroscopy . By measure change excretion time , rate gastric emptying determine .</detailed_description>
