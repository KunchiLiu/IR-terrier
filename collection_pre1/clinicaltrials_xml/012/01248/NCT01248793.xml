If patient Group 1 still receive placebo injection , improvement total back pain Week 16 , receive golimumab 50 mg every 4 week start Week 24 . If patient Group 2 ( golimumab 50 mg ) already receive golimumab injection week 24 , continue receive golimumab every 4 week . Safety monitor throughout study , include draw blood look laboratory test , vital sign ( eg , blood pressure ) , frequency type adverse event ( side effect ) . The patient study approximately 56 week . Patients receive placebo active compound ( golimumab 50 mg subcutaneous injection ) every four week Week 48 .</detailed_description>
