	<brief_title>Bone Skin Thickness Study : Obese Versus Normal Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study examine pelvic CT scan injured patient determine skin thickness several distinct region important orthopedic surgery . All patient admit University Mississippi Medical Center pelvic ring injury acetabular fracture obtain pelvic CT scan standard part patient evaluation . The CT scan attempt encompass entire soft tissue sleeve skin edge pelvic bone . Several landmark describe described measure important surgical site obesity problematical . Therefore study attempt quantify size soft tissue envelope patient However , patient markedly obese may large entire soft tissue sleeve image CT scan . The second part study validate CT scan measurement obtain use clinical measurement . The clinical measurement obtain operative management displace pelvic ring injury and/or acetabular fracture . During surgical exposure , measure tape use measure soft tissue thickness area correspond CT scan measurement . These measure compare validate effectiveness CT scan measurement accurately document soft tissue dimension .</detailed_description>
