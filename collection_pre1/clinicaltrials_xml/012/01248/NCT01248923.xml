	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 study patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma ( MM ) plasma cell leukemia ( PCL ) receive investigational study drug ARRY-520 bortezomib , without dexamethasone , granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) support . This study 2 part . In first part , patient receive increase dos study drug ( 2 dose schedule evaluate ) combination ( 1 ) bortezomib G-CSF support ( 2 ) bortezomib dexamethasone G-CSF support , order achieve high dose study drug possible cause unacceptable side effect . Approximately 45 patient US enrol Part 1 ( Active , recruit ) . In second part study , patient receive best dose ( ) schedule ( ) study drug , combination bortezomib ± dexamethasone + G-CSF , determine first part study follow see side effect combination cause effectiveness combination , , treat cancer . Approximately 42 patient US enrol Part 2 ( Active , recruit ) .</brief_summary>
