	<brief_summary>Traditionally cancer pain treat long acting opioids morphine around clock . However , evidence patient stable pain require around clock medication . So far opioids self-administration rapid onset action available . Recently nasal formulation fentanyl ( opioid similar morphine ) release Europe treatment breakthrough pain , i.e . unpredictable pain short duration break otherwise stable pain control around clock medication . The basic idea formulation may open patient control analgesia chronic cancer pain , due ultra rapid onset action nasally deliver fentanyl . This mean patient take medication pain . This single center feasibility / safety study first part study investigate alternative cancer pain treatment approach .</brief_summary>
