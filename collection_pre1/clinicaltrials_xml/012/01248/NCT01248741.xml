	<brief_summary>High Dose Rate ( HDR ) temporary prostate brachytherapy offer precise form dose escalation prostate cancer . Needles place , position confirm treatment deliver . Previously High Dose Rate prostate brachytherapy perform TransRectal UltraSound ( TRUS ) guidance plan Computed Tomography ( CT ) imaging introduce source error needle displacement transport reposition patient . Recently Varian introduce one-step procedure implant planning base UltraSound image perform without patient repositioning . This planning system approve Health Canada commercially available . This study use High Dose Rate brachytherapy treat 15 men . Treatment plan TransRectal UltraSound validate pre-treatment use Computed Tomography imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT-validation Ultrasound Based Planning High Dose Rate ( HDR ) Prostate Brachytherapy Using Vitesse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifteen men intermediate risk prostate cancer , suitable combination external beam radiotherapy High Dose Rate brachytherapy enter study . High Dose Rate brachytherapy perform use TransRectal UltraSound guidance plan use cone-beam Computed Tomography TransRectal UltraSound . Planning Computed Tomography check reliability reproducibility UltraSound image correctly identify needle position . Correct needle localization essential basis determine source dwell position , dose calculation dose optimization .</detailed_description>
