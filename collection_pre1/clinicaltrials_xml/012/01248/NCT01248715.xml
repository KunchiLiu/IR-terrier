	<brief_summary>Current guideline recommend early initiation empiric antibiotic therapy cover typical atypical bacteria may cause community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) . Influenza antiviral therapy patient suspect confirmed influenza . However , many clinician suspect influenza among patient CAP acute low respiratory tract illness ( LRTI ) often test influenza . Additionally , result currently available diagnostic test influenza may delay several test low sensitivity give false negative result . Thus , anti-influenza treatment patient hospitalize influenza CAP LRTI frequently initiate late . There association delay time administration empiric antibiotic therapy increase clinical failure mortality . As result , empiric antibiotic therapy patient suspect CAP begin within 4 - 6 hour hospitalization . This recently demonstrate delayed antiviral treatment well . We hypothesize , happen early empiric antibiotic bacterial CAP , standardize approach add early empiric anti-influenza therapy influenza season hospitalize patient suspect CAP LRTI improve clinical outcome patient influenza associate CAP LRTI . To test hypothesis plan prospective , randomize , multicenter clinical trial hospitalize patient acute LRTI , include suspect CAP , . If early anti-influenza medication include patient admission order , patient randomize standard care , include empiric antibacterial therapy recommend ATS/IDSA guideline plus standard influenza diagnostics treatment ( Standard care ) versus early initiation empiric antiinfluenza therapy plus standard care , e.g . empiric antibacterial ( oseltamivir group ) . The primary study outcome development clinical failure select clinical outcome 30 day enrollment . Other clinical outcome compare study group include time clinical stability , duration hospitalization , development cardiovascular event , re-hospitalization , short-term mortality ( 30 day ) , long-term mortality ( 1 year ) . The secondary study outcome cost-effectiveness intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Empiric Treatment With Oseltamivir Study ( RETOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , unblinded clinical study hospitalize patient acute LRTI admit one four institution Louisville , KY ( rapid empiric treatment oseltamivir study [ RETOS ] ) prospective observation study describe influenza LRTI ( Flu LRTI study ) . All hospitalized patient acute LRTI invite participate one arm study . If admit clinician order oseltamivir zanamivir time hospital admission , patient eligible randomization Group A ( standard clinical care , include empiric antibiotic anti-influenza drug clinician discretion ) Group B ( oseltamivir administer patient within 24 hour admission , ideally within 8-12 hour admission , plus empiric antibiotic ) . If admit clinician order oseltamivir zanamivir patient eligible randomization eligible enrollment observational study describe clinical course outcomes patient influenza LRTI ( Group C ) . The primary Aim influenza LRTI study ( Group C ) describe hospitalize patient LRTI suspect influenza time admission , include proportion w PCR confirmation , select clinical outcome clinical failure . Patients enrol one four hospital , University Louisville Hospital , Veterans Affairs Medical Center Louisville , Norton Hospital Louisville , Jewish Hospital Louisville . Eligible patient identify primarily Emergency Departments four hospital evaluate inclusion/exclusion criterion hospital admission order write . Patients enrol influenza season . For study , influenza season define December 1st May 1st , unless surveillance data suggest influenza virus circulate earlier stop circulate . For three study group , diagnosis influenza base nucleic acid amplification polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . At time enrollment study , nasopharyngeal swab obtain PCR . The University Louisville Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory extensive experience use molecular technique diagnosis respiratory pathogen test batch specimen monthly interval . In addition , collect result test do routine care bacterial virus isolates identify routine care characterization . The management patient Group A Group B different regard early empiric anti-influenza therapy . All aspect management patient compliance national guideline recommendation IDSA/ATS ( 2 ) . Patients Group A may antiviral therapy start later hospitalization treat . The study interfere Group A patient care . A 1:1 randomization ratio within two study arm plan EOS . A pre-defined randomization chart design order randomization process Internet-based . The randomization table accessible project manager back event problem occur Internet computerized system . We attempt begin oseltamivir within 8 - 12 hour hospital admission , later 24 hour . The study nurse facilitate receipt early oseltamivir treatment consent patient collaboration hospital pharmacy . The time oseltamivir administration record enrolled patient .</detailed_description>
