	<brief_summary>With grow public health concern seasonal influenza H1N1 United States , primary mean addressed prevention , namely , vaccination influenza virus . The individual able receive vaccination primary care provider 's office patient egg allergy , rare circumstance , individual allergy component vaccine . Current guideline allow administration influenza vaccine patient egg allergy use vaccine low egg protein ( ovalbumin ) content use skin test follow 5-dose desensitization protocol . Since impractical perform primary care office cumbersome allergist , many egg-allergic patient simply receive influenza vaccine , leave vulnerable disease likely become source contagion . Several study suggest influenza vaccination use 1-2 dose protocol may safe . This fact due large part low ovalbumin ( egg protein ) content modern influenza vaccine . All study influenza vaccination egg-allergic patient do use intramuscular trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) . However , trivalent live-attenuated , cold-adapted influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) , deliver intranasally , low publish ovalbumin content injectable vaccine , suggest may also well-tolerated egg-allergic patient . According several study , LAIV may efficacious TIV child . It goal investigator evaluate safety immunize egg-allergic individual LAIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FluMist Egg Allergic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients egg allergy recruit study . Since trivalent live-attenuated , cold-adapted influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) contain low amount egg protein available influenza vaccine market , eligible receive intranasal formulation ( LAIV group ) ( ie age 2-49y , asthmatic ) receive FluMist ; others receive intramuscular injection single dose without skin testing ( TIV group ) . All subject monitor 30 minute post-vaccine signs/symptoms immediate allergic reaction . Subjects also followed-up phone 24-48 hour administration assess delay allergic reaction . Data collect one entire Influenza season ( 2010-2011 ) .</detailed_description>
