	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) affect 10-18 % adult population become recognize one serious disorder cause increase risk cardiovascular disease death . In patient ischemic heart disease 26 % increased creatinine , rise 40 % patient also diabetes mellitus . Risk increase renal function diminishes , slow rate decline renal function would tremendous impact health morbidity . This association commonly term Cardiorenal Syndrome , though cause much complex interplay major pathogenetic pathway glucose metabolism diabetes , systemic tissue inflammation , tissue metabolism , coagulation , mineral metabolism , sympathetic activation , renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation , endothelial dysfunction , lipid metabolism , fetal programming etc . Karolinska Institutet recently merge basic clinical researcher field , create Karolinska Kardiorenal Theme Centre ; ultimately aim explore syndrome provide improve care individual patient . The investigator road success : - Creating Biobank ( blood , DNA , plasma ) majority hosptalized patient ACS Stockholm county - Stockholmheartbank . - This Theme Center include teach hospital associate Karolinska Institutet ; Danderyd University Hospital , Karolinska University Hospital SÃ¶dersjukhuset University Hospital . Together theses hospital serve emergency hospital 1.9 million people . The investigator aim create biobank patient admit acute coronary event ( 2.300/yr ) , unique asset molecular genetic research well observational intervention study . - The investigator access National registry 100 % coverage , contain data patient admit Stockholms coronary care unit since 1995 . - To ensure translation clinical practice , researcher also MD : , several clinically active . - The clinical network facilitates development novel therapy translational research . - Steering group Education Clinical Practice implementation program .</brief_summary>
