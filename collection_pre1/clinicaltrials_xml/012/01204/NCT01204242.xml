	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether local anesthetic drug ( lidocaine ) give anesthesia intravenously ( IV ) needle vein , ) , : 1 . Help decrease pain surgery . 2 . Have need less pain medication . 3 . Have less side effect like nausea vomit follow surgery . 4 . Help prevent chronic pain . 5 . Affect recurrence cancer surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pain breast surgery usually treat narcotic ; however , associate high incidence side effect itch , nausea vomiting , constipation , urinary retention dizziness . Another modality pain control regional anesthesia ; thoracic paravertebral block [ TPVB ] use local anesthetic particularly appeal breast surgery . They provide good pain control , possibly blunt surgical stress response , decrease need anesthetic agent . However , TPVB widely use , inherent risk associate placement , pneumothorax , nerve injury , bleed infection , make less appealing patient . From pain management point view , paravertebral block may optimal approach reduce pain opiate consumption breast cancer surgery . In addition , retrospective data suggest reduction cancer recurrence technique use . Unfortunately , effective technique widely perform risk pneumothorax use center . Our intent study alternative approach few risk . In study , test ability intravenous lidocaine provide pain relief breast surgery . We base hypothesis number previous trial show significant benefit intravenous local anesthetic set abdominal surgery1-4 . Approximately 30 50 % patient develop chronic pain follow mastectomy5,6 . It suggest adequately treat pain immediate perioperative period prevent chronic pain . Specifically , application EMLA ( local anesthetic ) cream perioperatively breast surgery show reduce incidence chronic pain development7 . Perioperative administration intravenous lidocaine may offer similar benefit . Therefore , study incidence chronic pain population 6 month . Finally , anesthetic choice primary surgical intervention cancer may affect recurrence metastasis . A recent retrospective study suggest profound reduction recurrence breast cancer patient receive regional + general anesthesia compare general alone9 . Similar data publish abstract form regard recurrence prostate surgery10 . Also , Christopherson et al studied long-term survival 177 patient resection colon cancer trial general anesthesia without epidural anesthesia analgesia supplementation resection colon cancer . Epidural supplementation associate enhanced survival among patient without metastasis 1.46 years8 . Although mechanisms beneficial effect unclear , attenuation surgical stress response , modulation inflammatory system , and/or decrease requirement volatile anesthetic opiates regional anesthesia possible mechanisms11 . For example , neural input activate surgical stress may result activation promalignant pathway . Morphine show promote angiogenesis model breast cancer , key step tumor development12 . In addition , opiates interfere natural killer cell function13 . It conceivable beneficial effect recurrence might derive low systemic level local anesthetic attain regional anesthesia . A number study demonstrate significant reduction opiate requirement decrease magnitude stress response local anesthetic use intravenously1,3,4 . If , systemic administration would safer simple way reach goal . We therefore compare effect local anesthetic give intravenously compare placebo cancer recurrence rate .</detailed_description>
