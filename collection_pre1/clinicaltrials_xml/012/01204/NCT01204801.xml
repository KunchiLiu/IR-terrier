	<brief_title>Randomized Study Combination Chemotherapy With Without Focused Microwave Thermotherapy Before Surgery Treating Women With Large Breast Cancer Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized multicenter Phase III clinical trial intend provide histopathological clinical information innovative , minimally-invasive approach ( focused microwave thermotherapy ) preoperative treatment breast cancer , use minimally invasive focus microwave phase array device , Medifocus , Inc. APA 1000 Breast Thermotherapy Treatment System ( heat treatment ) . Subjects large primary operable breast cancer , intact breast , clinical tumor size great equal 3.5 cm ( include tumor classification T2 T3 ) , clinically node negative N0 node positive ( N1 N2 ) distant metastasis ( M1 ) without distant metastasis ( M0 ) randomize ( ratio 1:1 ) receive ( 1 ) preoperative thermotherapy combine preoperative anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy standard care versus ( 2 ) preoperative anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy standard care alone . The anthracycline-based regimen limit current National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline dose/drug/schedule time patient enrollment . In arm study , standard care include breast imaging , drug , radiation therapy provide eligible subject follow preoperative regimen . At clinical discretion treat physician , subject estrogen-receptor positive may receive Tamoxifen therapy day follow completion chemotherapy . Radiation therapy breast tissue lymph node give part standard care eligible subject . Treatment Arm I ( new arm ) regimen include three preoperative thermotherapy treatment interval correspond first three cycle anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy plus standard care . The addition preoperative thermotherapy preoperative anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy may improve tumor response rate term shrinkage ( primary endpoint ) may increase option perform breast conservation ( secondary endpoint ) compare achieve preoperative anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy standard care alone . Note : Since consensus combination drug regimen neoadjuvant treatment large breast cancer tumor , study site use standard care include chemotherapy/drug agent commonly use combination anthracycline ( Doxorubicin ( trade name Adriamycin ) Epirubicin ( trade name Ellence ) ) , study base drug type . The rationale include patient distant metastasis ( M1 ) enrollment study follow . Traditionally , patient stage IV ( metastatic ) breast cancer intact primary breast tumor treat chemotherapy radiation palliation symptom , metastatic condition consider incurable disease . In case , surgery consider stage IV patient large , symptomatic breast lesion control local wound complication improve quality life . However , four recent retrospective peer-reviewed study suggest remove primary tumor may lead improvement overall survival . The investigator designee fully explain nature study subject , along aim , method , anticipated benefit , potential hazard discomfort participation might entail . After nature study explain subject 's question answer , subject agree participate study , inform consent review sign subject . Each subject treat thermochemotherapy ( new arm ) chemotherapy alone ( control arm ) follow 90 day surgery study . Patients follow annually practice standard care participate institution - patient follow tumor recurrence future medical intervention relate patient 's breast cancer . Thermotherapy administer out-patient setting . During thermotherapy complete approximately 60 minute less , patient treat prone position treatment bed . After administer local anesthetic , guide treatment minimally invasive combination microwave/temperature probe place tumor ultrasound guidance . The thermotherapy treatment adjust accordance patient comfort . Anthracycline-based chemotherapy administer accordance standard preoperative chemotherapy delivery study center - number chemotherapy cycle cycle timing may vary study . Each study center use anthracycline ( Doxorubicin Epidoxorubicin ) base chemotherapy agent chemotherapy agent drug vary depend study center subject specific need . Each cycle Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 four cycle Epidoxorubicin 100 mg/m2 6 cycle combination Standard Care chemotherapy administer nominally every 21 ( plus minues 7 ) day . The timing cycle anthracycline subject specific physician 's discretion , case anthracycline administer cycle time less seven ( 7 ) day anthracycline cycle . A thermotherapy session administer day administration first , second , third cycle preoperative Doxorubicin Epidoxorubicin chemotherapy . Chemotherapy administer subject receive thermotherapy . ( If thermotherapy session administer day Doxorubicin Epidoxorubicin chemotherapy administer soon possible follow day later 36 hour post Doxorubicin Epidoxorubicin chemotherapy . The remain cycle ( ) chemotherapy administer without thermotherapy . If desire cumulative minimum thermal dose achieve first three thermotherapy treatment , remain cycle ( ) chemotherapy administer without thermotherapy . If desire cumulative minimum thermal dose achieve first three preoperative Doxorubicin Epidoxorubicin chemotherapy cycle , thermotherapy administer fourth cycle preoperative chemotherapy . If subject tolerate one two thermotherapy treatment , subject continue study remain cycle chemotherapy . If subject clinically progressive disease , thermo-chemotherapy treatment discontinue subject receive remain cycle chemotherapy preoperatively postoperatively ( standard care ) . At end course thermo-chemotherapy chemotherapy alone , follow pre-surgery evaluation , surgeon subject make decision extent surgery perform . These decision make basis surgical institutional standard , National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) Breast Cancer Treatment Guidelines . Subjects undergo mastectomy breast-conserving surgery . It understood subject select mastectomy treatment even surgeon recommends breast conservation . The surgeon shall document reason either mastectomy breast conservation select . The subject undergo clinical exam image breast measure tumor size , day prior day lumpectomy mastectomy . Any additional imaging discretion physician . At discretion physician , optional core biopsy tumor take day prior day surgery . Following surgery , pathology perform excised breast tumor tissue determine tumor cell death . For breast conservation , breast must sufficient size allow adequate tumor removal satisfactory cosmetic result . The objective surgery obtain local control breast cancer best cosmetic result possible . A breast conservation surgery procedure require excision tumor margin without removal normal breast tissue require achieve negative margin . Pathologic evaluation excise tissue determine whether margin negative positive . For subject involve margin follow breast conservation surgery , breast tolerate , subject may undergo one segmental resection order achieve clear margin .</detailed_description>
