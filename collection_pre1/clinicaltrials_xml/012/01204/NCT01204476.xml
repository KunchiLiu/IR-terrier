	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose cixutumumab give together everolimus octreotide acetate treat patient advanced low- intermediate-grade neuroendocrine cancer . Monoclonal antibody , cixutumumab , may find tumor cell help carry tumor-killing substance . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Octreotide acetate may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth neuroendocrine cancer . Giving cixutumumab together everolimus octreotide acetate may better treatment neuroendocrine cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cixutumumab , Everolimus , Octreotide Acetate Treating Patients With Advanced Low Intermediate Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To recommend phase 2 dose combination IMC-A12 ( cixutumumab ) everolimus , give octreotide long-acting release ( LAR ) ( octreotide acetate ) , patient advance neuroendocrine tumor . II . To describe pharmacokinetics IMC-A12 give every 21 day combination everolimus octreotide LAR . III . To evaluate pharmacodynamic marker blood , tumor tissue . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety profile IMC-A12 everolimus octreotide LAR . II . To explore anti-tumor activity combination IMC-A12 everolimus define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) response rate progression-free survival ( PFS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore baseline molecular marker drug-induced molecular marker change may predict clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study cixutumumab . Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously ( IV ) 60-90 minute octreotide acetate intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 everolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
