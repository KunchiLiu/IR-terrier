	<brief_summary>A Phase II , single institution , double blind , randomize , placebo control , cross-over study explore safety efficacy apremilast patient active RA concomitant use TNF inhibition . Following screening period , patient active disease stable TNF inhibition randomize receive either apremilast placebo period 12 week . At end 12 week patient assess efficacy use ACR responder index look 20 % improvement , patient initially randomize treat blinded fashion apremilast cross placebo patient initially randomize treat placebo cross apremilast . Patients follow additional 12 week treatment assess safety efficacy combination treatment . Following 24 week active treatment early termination , patient undergo 28 day safety visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate efficacy apremilast use combination background DMARD TNF inhibition patient active RA use ACR responder index look 20 % improvement . To evaluate safety tolerability apremilast use combination TNF inhibition patient active RA . To evaluate clinical outcome RA use individual domain ACR responder index1 . To evaluate clinical outcome RA use Disease Activity Score ( DAS28 ) 2 To investigate effect apremilast change cytokine plasma concentration level ( baseline Week 12 ) achievement ACR response</detailed_description>
