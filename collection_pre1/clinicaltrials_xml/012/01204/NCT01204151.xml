	<detailed_description>There experimental data skill acquisition use matching-to-sample technique ( specific cognitive intervention ) conduct individual FXS . Further , study conduct examine possible underlie mediate brain process involve matching-to-sample skill acquisition child FXS neurodevelopmental disorder . Previous pilot data indicate computerized match-to-sample procedure , even conduct time-limited session , may significantly help individual FXS learn new skill . We plan utilize brain image methodology compare functional connectivity network pass fail equivalence test . 30 subject FXS 30 control subject idiopathic developmental disability enrol study . All subject enrol Stanford .</detailed_description>
