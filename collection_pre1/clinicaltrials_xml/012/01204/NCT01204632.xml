	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop field-test new tool diagnosis hazard assessment cardiometabolic risk ( CMR ) people chronic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) advance evidence base much need information CMR cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) burden people SCI . These data use develop screen guideline early identification prevention CMR SCI , well targeted approach primary disease management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Unlike current assessment utilize lipid score , new system anchor reliable measurement cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) burden use contemporary surrogate end point coronary artery calcium ( CAC ) score , coronary CT angiography carotid intima medium thickness ( CIMT ) . By end 5-year funding cycle develop updatable web-based cardiometabolic risk assessment tool ( RISK ) allow clinician SCI consumer quantify risk cardiovascular sentinel event ( stroke , non-fatal heart attack , death ) also provide body mass index ( BMI ) table adjust SCI . Specific Aims : 1 . Examine relationship among surrogate cardiovascular disease burden person SCI establish cardiometabolic risk . 2 . Identify significant predictor cardiometabolic risk ( CMR ) unique person specific level SCI . 3 . Develop validate SCI CMR assessment tool ( RISK ) base cardiometabolic risk score . 4 . Develop validate adjust BMI table SCI .</detailed_description>
