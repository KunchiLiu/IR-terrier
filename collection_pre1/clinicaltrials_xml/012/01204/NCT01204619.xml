	<brief_summary>Since emergence home peritoneal dialysis alternative in-center hemodialysis chronic renal replacement therapy late 1970s , percentage dialysis patient PD continue decrease year . There grow concern research patient technique survival peritoneal dialysis versus hemodialysis find influential factor well clinical outcome . Meanwhile , technique failure rate significantly high small center treat less twenty five PD patient . And result good technique survival second year , among patient train BREC ( Baxter Renal Education Center ) . Better technique survival large center assume experience patient management also educational infrastructure compare small-sized center . Throughout experience last 30 year , recognize major element PD program patient training , however data available term relationship PD training treatment outcome mostly retrospective non-randomized . Moreover , technique survival patient survival analyze significant difference . From insight , decide study prospectively evaluate efficacy well-structured education program term various patient outcome incident patient PD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct multi-center , open-label , randomize , control trial . One hundred four patient start PD randomize two training group . Patients conventional train group ( CG ) give non-standardized in-center conventional training program plus two session train home visit , intensive training group ( IG ) give in-center conventional training program plus repeat home visit regularly 24-month period ( total thirteen visit ) . The primary end point study exit site infection ( ESI ) . Secondary endpoint peritonitis all-cause infection . Generalized Estimating Equations use assess adjusted effect train level ESI Cox regression model employ evaluate effect peritonitis secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
