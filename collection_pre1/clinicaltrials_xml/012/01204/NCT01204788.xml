	<brief_summary>Patients leukemia often low white blood cell count chemotherapy , put great risk infection . The standard care prevent infection give patient antibiotic , antifungal , antiviral drug time white blood cell count low . However , many patient still develop infection chemotherapy . Radiated white blood cell transfusion standard treatment patient develop severe infection . The goal clinical research study learn give unirradiated white blood cell transfusion early chemotherapy might delay prevent infection patient leukemia . Researchers also want learn type severity infection occur .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic White Cell Transfusions Versus Therapeutic White Cell Transfusions Patients With Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , 1 first 60 participant enrol , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group : - If Group 1 , receive standard care drug use prevent infection . You also receive unirradiated white blood cell transfusion 2-3 time week . If point develop infection , white blood cell transfusion give daily addition standard treatment infection . - If Group 2 , receive standard care drug use prevent infection . You receive unirradiated white blood cell transfusion point develop infection . You receive transfusion daily , addition standard treatment infection . If 1 first 60 participant enrol , assign study group study doctor decides best interest . This decide base first participant respond different treatment . The drug receive part standard therapy study doctor . Study Procedures : During white blood cell transfusion , receive white blood cell volunteer donor needle vein . Each transfusion take anywhere 1 hour several hour , depend tolerate treatment . Before white blood cell transfusion , vital sign record . During 1 hour transfusion , monitor side effect . You may give drug help reduce side effect . Your doctor tell drug give side effect . While hospital leukemia treatment , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check fungal infection 2-3 time week . This test do 1 time week hospital doctor longer think need . If point develop fever study , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check infection . You also CT scan within 3 day develop fever . If doctor think need , CT scan 2 week later point doctor think need check infection . Length Study : You continue transfusion doctor think infection control white blood cell count stay certain level least 2 day row . If point discharge hospital doctor want continue receive white blood cell transfusion , able receive outpatient . You monitor side effect sign infection 2 cycle anti-leukemia treatment review medical record . You take study intolerable side effect . This investigational study . Radiated white blood cell transfusion consider standard procedure treatment serious infection . It investigational give unirradiated white blood cell transfusion way prevent infection . Up 240 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
