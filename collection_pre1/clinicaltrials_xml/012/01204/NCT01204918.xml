	<detailed_description>This study aim examine antidepressant efficacy riluzole , employ randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 8 week trial adjunctive trial treatment-resistant major depressive disorder ( TRD ) . Preclinical study show riluzole modulate Glu release clearance , potent neuroprotective property , promote neuro-resiliency . Other preclinical data also show drug antidepressant-like effect rodent model use screen antidepressant activity . In addition , several small open-label clinical study suggest riluzole antidepressant anxiolytic property , even patient respond standard monoaminergic antidepressant anxiolytic medication .</detailed_description>
