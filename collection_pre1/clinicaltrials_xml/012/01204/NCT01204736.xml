	<brief_title>Comparing Outcomes Elbow Extension Tendon Transfers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Voluntary control elbow extension significantly improve functional ability individual tetraplegia . As result , surgical reconstruction elbow extension via tendon transfer consider fundamental intervention benefit patient , even tendon transfer aim improve hand function never perform . Presently , two common tendon transfer surgery use restore elbow extension follow spinal cord injury . These posterior deltoid triceps transfer biceps triceps transfer . Both surgery significantly improve voluntary elbow extension , although variability amount control restore among patient . This study directly compare performance posterior deltoid transfer biceps transfer regard : voluntary elbow extension strength , ability activate transfer , neural factor associate voluntary involuntary control individual muscle . These comparison make functionally relevant posture provide fundamental information improve clinical understanding capacity two procedure restore elbow extension . The fundamental hypothesis proposal inability maximally activate transfer posterior deltoid transfer biceps significantly limit elbow extension moment produce .</detailed_description>
