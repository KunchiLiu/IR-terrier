	<detailed_description>The ability independently self-propel transfer oneself crucial component daily life individual spinal cord injury . This ability related part individual 's strength , power , endurance , unknown measure important achieve high level wheelchair function . Identification physical performance parameter best relate wheeled mobility performance essential develop intervention improve say performance . Currently , clinic-friendly assessment person 's wheeled mobility ability exist . We develop modify , clinic-friendly version validate wheelchair mobility assessment complete clinic . Before implemented clinician reliability must establish . Crossvalidating standard measure physical performance allow identification appropriate exercise intervention improve independent wheeled mobility .</detailed_description>
