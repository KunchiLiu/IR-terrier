	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - ass pathological Complete Response ( pCR ) rate breast patient treat follow combination : SAR240550 twice-weekly + weekly paclitaxel , SAR240550 weekly+ weekly paclitaxel , weekly paclitaxel single agent calibrator . Secondary objective : - pCR rate breast axilla , - Radiological/clinical objective response rate ( ORR ) , breast conservation rate , disease free survival ( DFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , treatment arm , - Safety profile study combination single agent reference treatment , - Molecular characteristic tumor tissue peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) correlation biological activity study treatment disease outcome . Based data generate BiPar/Sanofi , conclude iniparib posse characteristic typical PARP inhibitor class . The exact mechanism yet fully elucidate , however base experiment tumor cell perform laboratory , iniparib novel investigational anti-cancer agent induces gamma-H2AX ( marker DNA damage ) tumor cell line , induces cell cycle arrest G2/M phase tumor cell line , potentiates cell cycle effect DNA damage modality tumor cell line . Investigations potential target iniparib metabolite ongoing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Active study treatment give either twice weekly administration ( Day 1 Day 4 ) weekly administration ( Day 1 ) maximum 24 infusion Arm A maximum 12 infusion Arm B . In study arm , treatment give definitive surgery , first sign disease progression , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal patient consent . Definitive surgery perform within 2 4 week last dose study treatment . Patients complete study treatment withdraw consent experience intolerable toxicity undergo surgery accord local practice . The cut-off date primary analysis 30 day last study treatment administration date definitive surgery , whichever come last . The maximum follow individual patient death 5 year definitive surgery date whatever happen first .</detailed_description>
