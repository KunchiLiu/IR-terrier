	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Valortim , one select formulation component , induces wheal reaction introduce percutaneously . Two 4 subject dose previous study modify formulation Valortim experience treatment related adverse event suggestive allergic allergic-like reaction . In order well characterize reaction determine represent allergic allergic-like reaction Valortim one component , skin test Valortim select component naïve Valortim-exposed subject perform study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Valortim® ( MDX-1303 ) Its Selected Formulation Components Percutaneous Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A maximum 7 subject participate study . Up four subject previously expose IV Valortim . The study conduct two stage . The first stage perform subject previously expose Valortim ( Valortim-naïve subject ) , determine correct dilution test component . The second stage perform Valortim-exposed subject use dilution test component determine first stage study . The following component test determine ability induce wheal reaction shortly exposure skin percutaneous application needle prick : Valortim ( Lot # 10-08-001 ) , polysorbate 80 , mannitol , histamine ( positive control ) , saline ( negative control ) . All component except histamine provide clinical site PharmAthene detailed instruction handle , storage , dilution . A tiny drop aforementioned component introduce onto surface skin skin prick , allow component enter surface skin . Multiple component test subject ' forearm back ; location test determined scar , mole , pre-existing skin lesion , issue deem Principal Investigator ( PI ) potential interfere interpretation result . Stage I : - 3 Valortim-naïve , non-allergic subject - Only one subject skin test single day - Subjects test percutaneously mentioned component follow dilution : - Valortim ( Lot # 10-08-001 , 25 mg/mL ) filter 0.22 µm syringe filter dilute 1:1000 , 1:100 , 1:10 , 1:1 saline . - Polysorbate 80 dilute saline follow concentration : 0.06 mg/mL , 0.2 mg/mL , 0.6 mg/mL . - Mannitol ( 30 mg/mL ) dilute saline follow concentration : 1:1000 , 1:100 , 1:10 , 1:1 - Histamine ( 1 mg/mL ) , positive control - Saline ( 0.9 % ) , negative control . - Multiple dilution Valortim , polysorbate 80 , mannitol use determine appropriate dilution second stage study attempt avoid possibility false positive reaction due irritation . - The start dilution Valortim mannitol 1:1000 move progressively concentrated dilution ( 1:100 , 1:10 , 1:1 ) . The start dilution polysorbate 80 0.06 mg/mL also move progressively high concentration 0.2 mg/mL 0.6 mg/mL respectively . - Fifteen minute application test article , skin test site examine wheal reaction . The skin site examine 1 hour follow testing , prior discharge clinic . Subjects return 1 2 day follow test assess skin test site observe adverse event . - A skin test consider positive , 15 minute follow application , wheal produce test article equal great , cause positive control ( histamine ) , least 3 mm great wheal negative control ( saline ) . - A negative skin test wheal , wheal le 3 mm large saline control determine 15 minute follow application . Stage II : - It anticipate 4 subject receive Valortim previous study ( # 0036-08-05 ) participate Stage II study ; two subject experienced adverse event dose Valortim . Subjects test percutaneously Valortim , polysorbate 80 , mannitol , histamine , saline . - Only one subject skin test single day . - The appropriate dilution Valortim , mannitol , polysorbate 80 base result Stage I study . As do Stage I , Valortim filter 0.22 µm syringe filter . Histamine ( 1 mg/mL ) saline ( 0.9 % ) use positive negative control , respectively . - Fifteen minute application test article prick skin , skin test site examine wheal reaction . The skin site examine 1 hour follow testing , prior discharge clinic . Subjects return 1 2 day follow test assess skin test site observe adverse event . - A skin test consider positive wheal produce test article 15 minute follow application equal great cause positive control ( histamine ) , least 3 mm great wheal negative control ( saline ) . - A negative skin test wheal , wheal le 3 mm large saline control determine 15 minute follow application .</detailed_description>
