	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine treatment paclitaxel plus AMG 386 superior paclitaxel plus placebo woman recurrent partially platinum sensitive resistant epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer . AMG 386 man-made medication design stop development blood vessel cancer tissue . Cancer tissue rely development new blood vessel , process call angiogenesis , obtain supply oxygen nutrient grow .</brief_summary>
