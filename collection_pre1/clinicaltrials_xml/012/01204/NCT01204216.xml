	<brief_summary>Prevention complication veteran diabetes depends heavily assessment blood glucose HbA1c . The HbA1c blood test measure exposure hemoglobin ( Hb ) person 's average blood glucose lifespan red blood cell ( RBC ) . The test heavily rely upon measure blood glucose control . It normally assume people ( without diabetes ) narrow range red blood cell survival . It recently show valid assumption . A precise test red blood cell survival , use biotin label method , demonstrate substantial difference red blood cell survival among otherwise normal people . There sufficient difference red blood cell survival alter estimate glycemic control HbA1c test much 30 per cent . This introduces concern HbA1c value mean thing significant number people . Although evidence clear variation RBC survival among people , attribute variation difference individual depend answer several simple question surprisingly remain unanswered : whether RBC survival stable time within individual whether blood glucose control affect stability . Therefore , goal propose study define characteristic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The first Specific Aim test hypothesis mean RBC age stable subject without diabetes subject diabetes stable glycemic control . The second Specific Aim test hypothesis mean RBC age change subject diabetes study initially poor glycemic control , treat stable , improved glycemic control &gt; 8 month . To accomplish two aim , RBC survival mean blood glucose determine two time separate least eight month 10 subject without diabetes , 10 subject diabetes stable glycemic control , 15 subject diabetes initial poor glycemic control order re-study 10 subject subsequently improve glycemic control . The RBC survival measure use novel biotin RBC label conjunction mean glucose determination continuous glucose monitoring . Mean blood glucose assess use blood glucose test meter , continuous glucose monitoring equipment , HbA1c , fructosamine glycated albumin determination HbA1c highly value clinical test long term monitor glycemic control prediction diabetes complication risk rely upon hundred thousand clinical decision make every year veterans diabetes . The proposed study , define RBC survival stability necessary develop new approach HbA1c interpretation , therefore potential dramatically support Department Veterans Affairs mission reduce burden diabetes complication</detailed_description>
