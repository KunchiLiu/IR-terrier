	<brief_summary>Nitroglycerin nitric oxide donor mainly know vasodilating agent use ischemic heart disease . It also show increase tumor blood flow animal human tumor . The addition nitroglycerin chemotherapy non small cell lung cancer show generate favorable response rate respect standard treatment schedule [ 5 ] . Theoretically nitroglycerin might reduce resistance chemotherapy via plethora different effect : good tumor perfusion , direct effect NO cancer cell , increase activate p53 protein via increased blood flow tumour consequence high drug concentration tumor [ 6 ] . In mouse , nitric oxide donor isosorbide dinitrate show decrease tumor hypoxia well tumor perfusion , could enhance radiotherapy response [ 7 ] . To date combine effect test human . In trial would like demonstrate effect nitroglycerin tumor perfusion hypoxia non small cell lung cancer ( use DCE HX4 scan ) , provide rationale study test effect combine nitroglycerine standard treatment NSCLC ( radiotherapy/chemotherapy ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Namely , failure many different tumor type show lasting response chemotherapy radiotherapy might attributable lack oxygen supply ( call `` hypoxia '' hereon ) large part cancer cell . Tumor hypoxia well-known factor negatively influence outcome many solid tumor , include lung cancer , head neck cancer , etc . Hypoxic cell radio-resistant , chemo-resistant prone develop distant metastasis normoxic cell . Nitroglycerin , due ` vasoactive effect , tend redistribute blood supply tumor , increase tumor blood flow , hereby theoretically decrease hypoxia . It show NO donate drug alter tumor blood flow oxygenation status animal model [ 7 ] . In randomized phase 2 trial Yasuda nitroglycerin successfully combine dose 25 mg daily 5 day chemo cycle cisplatin vinorelbine non small cell lung cancer , enhance chemotherapy response , possibly due good delivery anti-cancer drug tumor [ 5 ] . The toxicity profile 2 arm significantly different . The effect nitroglycerin donate drug cancer find numerous : increase tumor bloodflow , also direct effect stabilization p53 degradation Hif-1 alpha find [ 6 ] . Decreased hypoxic biomarkers ( eg VEGF , P-glycoprotein ) find patient NSCLC treat nitroglycerin patch 3 day prior surgery compare non-treated individual [ 8 ] . There might also supplementary effect MHC-molecules , render tumor cell `` visible '' immune system [ 9 ] . Furthermore , hypoxia show vitro increase invasiveness cancer cell NO-mediated manner , block NO-donors . [ 10 ] An interesting study respect non-randomized phase 2 trial Siemens et al , low dose nitroglycerin ( Minitran 5 patch ( 18 mg ) cut 6 piece , deliver 0.033 mg/h stead 0.2 mg/h normally ) give patient biochemical recurrence ( PSA-failure ) primary therapy . After 24 month PSA double time 31 month versus 12.8 month start therapy , demonstrate inhibitory effect nitroglycerin prostate cancer cell . [ 11 ] Due effect effect tumor bloodflow decrease hypoxia nitroglycerin might also interest radiosensitizing agent . Currently Mexican phase 2 trial recruit 40 patient evaluate efficacy nitroglycerin add concurrent chemoradiotherapy NSCLC stage III . ( Clinical trials.gov identifier NCT00886405 ) . The aim present study demonstrate effect nitroglycerin perfusion hypoxia ( HX4- ) scan patient , also document efficacy approach give nitroglycerin on/off ( 12h/12h ) schedule people receive ( chemo- ) /radiotherapy , whilst monitoring toxicity . The on-off schedule choose existence tolerance effect vascular system , hence diminish effect nitroglycerin already first 24 hour .</detailed_description>
