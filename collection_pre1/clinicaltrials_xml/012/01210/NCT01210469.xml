	<brief_title>Effectiveness Two Treatments Posture Balance Elderly Women With Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The decrease postural control muscle strength lower limb identify major risk factor fall old people . Exercises proven effective decreasing risk factor healthy elderly , little known effect intervention exercise elderly osteoporosis . Objective : To compare efficacy two exercise program - first consist balance training muscle strength second consist balance training muscle stretch exercise - improve postural control elderly woman osteoporosis . Methods : Fifty elderly age 65 old , diagnosis osteoporosis , randomize 3 group : Strength Group ( n = 17 ) perform balance training muscle strengthen ; Stretching Group ( n = 17 ) perform balance training stretch ; Control Group ( n =16 ) activity . The group train 8 week , session 60 minute , twice week . Postural control evaluate Modified Clinical Test Sensory Interaction Balance ( CTSIBm ) Limits Stability test ( LOS ) Balance Master force plate , functional balance Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) , muscle strength dynamometry , shorten hamstring goniometry posture PAS/SAPO ( Postural Assessment Software ) .</detailed_description>
