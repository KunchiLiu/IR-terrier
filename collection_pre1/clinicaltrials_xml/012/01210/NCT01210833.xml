	<brief_summary>HandTutor computerized system design evaluate rehabilitate hand function . It compose glove optic sensor detect movement wrist finger biofeedback software design evaluate exercise hand movement supply variety computer graphic pattern . The HandTutor use test stroke population , seem potential used hand injuried population . As first step , important investigate characteristic system matching hand injuried population . The purpose study characterize HandTuror system focus objective : 1 . To examine test-retest reliability system measure range motion ( ROM ) finger among healthy people ( control group ) . 2 . To examine correlation ROM measure HandTutor ROM measure conventional assessment tool ( goniometer ) . 3 . To examine ability system distinguish healthy people hand injured people . 4 . To examine correlation performance HandTutor ( game part ) , performance functional activity . 5 . To examine participant feedback use HandTutor ( degree enjoyment ) .</brief_summary>
