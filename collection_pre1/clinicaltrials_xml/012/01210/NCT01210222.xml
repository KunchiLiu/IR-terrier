	<brief_title>Trebananib Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient persistent recurrent endometrial cancer , survive progression-free least 6 month proportion patient objective tumor response ( complete partial ) , treat AMG 386 ( trebananib ) . II . To determine nature degree toxicity AMG 386 cohort patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient persistent recurrent endometrial cancer treat AMG 386 . OUTLINE : Patients receive trebananib intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
