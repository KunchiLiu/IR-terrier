	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether effect two new anticoagulant , Dabigatran Rivaroxaban , reverse non-specific specific inhibitor . For Dabigatran investigator test non-specific inhibitor : prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) , recombinant activate coagulation factor VII , activate prothrombin-complex ( FEIBA ) . For Rivaroxaban investigator test specific Rivaroxaban decoy ( FXa-GLAless ) . This do laboratory use blood plasma healthy male volunteer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background objective : Currently widely prescribe long term anticoagulant drug anti vitamin K agent ( AVK ) . They use caution drug narrow therapeutic range : difference effective dose toxic dose small . Their use thus require careful laboratory monitoring . They cause bleed complication case overdose . The AVKs two antidote : Vitamin K prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) . These reverse anticoagulant effect . In recent year , new type anticoagulant market particular Rivaroxaban ( Xarelto ® ) Dabigatran ( Pradaxa ® ) . The way act different AVK . They advantage wider therapeutic range . Their use therefore easier . They require regular monitoring . However , currently , antidote evaluated reverse effect anticoagulant case emergency . The purpose study evaluate whether effect two new anticoagulant reverse non-specific specific inhibitor . For Dabigatran test non-specific inhibitor prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) , recombinant activate coagulation factor VII , activate prothrombin complex ( FEIBA ) . For Rivaroxaban test specific Rivaroxaban decoy ( FXa-GLAless ) . This do laboratory use blood plasma healthy volunteer . Methods : This proof concept , single centre , randomize , open , control , cross-over , phase IV study involve 10 healthy volunteer Each volunteer ask attend enrolment visit give information study ask sign write consent form . They electrocardiogram test , blood pressure pulse measure , medical history note , sample blood urine take . At second visit give one dose either Rivaroxaban ( 20mg ) Dabigatran ( 150mg ) , allocate randomly , 5 sample blood ( total 67.5mL ) take period 4 hour via catheter . The blood sample immediately centrifuge frozen . At 3rd visit , 15 day later , volunteer medical examination prior take drug . This visit follow procedure 2nd visit . At 4th visit medical examination make blood urine sample take . Plasma sample analyse challenged inhibitor biochemistry haematology department Grenoble University Hospital .</detailed_description>
