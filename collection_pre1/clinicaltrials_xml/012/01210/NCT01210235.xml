	<detailed_description>Background : Colorectal cancer second lead cause cancer death U.S . Many death could prevent screening , recommend adult age 50 old . Effective screening option include yearly fecal occult blood test , flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 year , colonoscopy every 10 year . Unfortunately , despite recommendation option , half adult age 50 old date test . Simple , cost-effective approach increase colorectal cancer screen rate need reduce burden colorectal cancer U.S. Objective/Hypothesis : Our hypothesis offer annual colorectal cancer screen fecal occult blood test eligible adult age 50 annual nurse-run influenza vaccination clinic result increased colorectal cancer screen rate , reach population under-screened past . Our overall objective develop , implement , test , disseminate intervention use annual fecal immunochemical test occult blood ( FIT ) Kaiser Permanente ( KP ) Northern California . Specific Aims : The specific aim research ( 1 ) develop implement comprehensive nurse-run FLU-FIT Program KP Santa Clara facility systematize offering FIT eligible patient age 50 80 attend annual influenza vaccination clinic ; ( 2 ) test effectiveness FLU-FIT Program improve colorectal cancer screen rate context time-randomized , controlled trial involve ethnically diverse population influenza vaccination clinic attendees 8 influenza vaccination site within 4 KP Northern California service area ; ( 3 ) evaluate reach robustness FLU-FIT Program implement within 8 site , ( 4 ) create FLU-FIT Program Toolkit use effort disseminate intervention within Kaiser Permanente clinical setting . Study Design : The study conduct 3 phase . In Phase 1 ( Year 1 ) , evaluate pilot FLU-FIT Program already underway KP Santa Clara implement systematically annual influenza vaccination clinic 2009-2010 . In Phase 2 ( Years 2 3 ) , key element KP Santa Clara FLU-FIT Program test time-randomized trial within 8 KP Northern California sit . On randomly assign date 8 influenza vaccination clinic site , patient receive either FLU-FIT Program ( intervention ) influenza vaccination ( control ) . The primary outcome proportion intervention subject age 50 80 initially due colorectal cancer screen become date colorectal screening within 3 month receive influenza vaccine , compare similar subject control group . The robustness intervention effective sustainable intervention increase rate colorectal cancer screen `` real world '' setting also evaluate accord RE-AIM criterion ( Reach , Efficacy , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ) . In Phase 3 ( Year 4 ) , data analyze , toolkit dissemination activity develop . Cancer Relevance : If successful widely implement , FLU-FIT Program could increase access colorectal cancer screen million Americans . This approach could also provide model develop effective cancer screen intervention depend solely primary care clinician , trigger regular contact patient healthcare system .</detailed_description>
