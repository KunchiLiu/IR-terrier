	<detailed_description>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPXT ) long history evaluation management cardiovascular disease , particularly patient advance heart failure . Cardiovascular exercise test safe , well-developed , validated method risk stratification objective documentation exercise capacity patient severe heart failure ( 1,2 ) . Recent study also show exercise test prognostic power heart failure hospitalization mortality ( 3,4 ) , limited publish data available large group advance heart failure patient , cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) Advanced suspect advanced heart failure . Typical patient screen study patient refer University Minnesota evaluation advance heart failure option , cardiac transplant mechanical circulatory support . This somewhat heterogeneous population , diagnose refer physician sufficiently severe heart failure seek tertiary care . Most anticipated severely depressed ejection fraction ( &lt; 30 % typically &lt; 20 % ) , patient preserve ejection fraction either hypertrophy restrictive cardiomyopathy also eligible . Patients pulmonary hypertension , therapy ( diuretic alone ) , also felt high risk develop right heart failure may also include . Patients already undergone LVAD cardiac transplant also consider advanced heart failure eligible participate , regardless severity symptom time enrollment . Healthy volunteer may include comparison . This non-randomized , observational investigation sub-maximal exercise ventilation parameter patient diagnose , suspect , advanced heart failure . Duration follow-up five year . Some subject undergo one exercise test . Patients present heart failure subsequently undergo CRT implantation , LVAD implantation , cardiac transplant ask repeat submaximal exercise test . The timing event unpredictable , duration follow-up predict . Subjects follow change status 5 year . The total number test one person could potentially 5 ( baseline plus one therapy ) , although expect participant would ask undergo 3 test . For patient without device : Patients start rest 2 minute wear face mask breathe parameter record use SHAPE-HF system ( SHAPE Medical St. Paul , MN ) measure respiratory airflow constituent respiratory gas , oxygen carbon dioxide . The SHAPE-HF system continue monitor patient start walk treadmill variable speed 1-3 mph variable grade 0-6 % . The total treadmill time 10 minute . For patient device : patient rest adjustment device make study physician device coordinator , do routinely clinical practice . This take 15 minute time ; participant wear face mask breathe parameter record use SHAPE-HF system ( SHAPE Medical St. Paul , MN ) measure respiratory airflow constituent respiratory gas , oxygen carbon dioxide . Device parameter return baseline setting follow part test . Sub-maximal exercise test approximately 30 minute duration perform treadmill slow constant pace , speed treadmill range 1-2 mph grade range 0-2 % depend patient 's exercise tolerance . The exercise split two round exercise 15 minute . Subjects may rest long would like two test . The first round , participant wear face mask breathe parameter record use SHAPE-HF system . ( See section 13B sample report ) . In second round , every two minute , 15 minute , participant ask take 8 breath use breathe bag contain standard mixture gas ( 0.7 % acetylene , 21 % oxygen , 9 % Helium balance nitrogen ) -this gas mixture routinely use pulmonary function laboratory measure lung function amount oxygen room air . Acetylene mass spectroscopy use measure cardiac output noninvasively . Neither SHAPE-HF system , method gas exchange exercise investigational . Participants treat cardiac resynchronization therapy and/or ventricular assist device may minor adjustment make device parameter every 2 minute test . The adjustment make study physician device coordinator , mention , do routine practice . Device parameter return baseline setting follow test .</detailed_description>
