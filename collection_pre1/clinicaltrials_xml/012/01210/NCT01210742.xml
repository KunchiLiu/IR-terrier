	<brief_summary>Treatment early osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee increase problem yet much research OA , date , concentrate predisposition , genetic cellular aspect treatment late stage disease ( arthroplasty ) . Clinicians review patient early OA great difficulty recommend appropriate efficacious intervention . The first line treatment patient early OA exercise , self-management weight loss . These tool suggest minimize need high risk treatment non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) surgery . Viscosupplementation use intra-articular injection hyaluronan ( Synvisc One ) relatively new treatment . To date , ideal patient viscosupplementation yet define . It know whether incorporation viscosupplementation overall clinical management beneficial influence patient early OA knee . This study generate rigorous pilot data assess need inform large randomize control trial ( RCT ) assess efficacy viscosupplementation . The study single blind randomise RCT . 60 patient document early OA randomise one two groupsÍ¾ Group V undergo `` one shot '' viscosupplementation use Synvisc One addition routine physiotherapy management knee OA . Group No V ( control ) viscosupplementation undergo similar routine management include physiotherapy management knee OA . Outcome measure include walk pain ( The Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index-WOMAC ) , overall WOMAC score , Oxford Knee Score ( OKS ) , American Knee Society score ( AKS ) , complication , activity level patient satisfaction . Health economics also evaluate . Measurements record pre-intervention six month follow treatment . The risk associate viscosupplementation minimal . Considering limited resource currently available health care , latter show high effectiveness physiotherapy alone , addition patient benefit , important health economic implication .</brief_summary>
