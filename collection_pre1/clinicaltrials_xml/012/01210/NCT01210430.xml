	<brief_summary>The investigator study determine often blood flow regulation abnormality abnormalities sympathetic regulation produce nitric oxide , angiotensin-II , oxidative stress occur POTS mechanism ( ) POTS individual patient . Specific cause POTS may vary patient patient . Patients compare healthy control subject . There treatment arm medication ( losartan ) reduce bind angiotensin increase NO . If investigator know specific biochemical mechanism investigator may able offer specific treatment specific patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic orthostatic intolerance due postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) severely impairs daily life million Americans , mostly young woman . POTS define symptom orthostatic intolerance associate excessive upright heart rate . While general agreement abnormality vascular regulation autonomic activity account tachycardia symptom POTS , pathophysiology heterogeneous partially characterize . The key feature POTS symptom prominent standing . However , , finding present supine ( lie ) worsen stand . Symptoms POTS include dizziness patient , exercise provoke symptom thus exercise intolerance , excessive fatigue , nausea abdominal pain , headache , shortness breath deep breathing , weakness , shakiness postural anxiety , pallor , neurocognitive loss ( difficulty think ) . These occur day-to-day basis . The symptom overlap case definition chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) POTS often find CFS young . Fainting relatively uncommon daily life . A major subset POTS increase peripheral resistance low blood flow ( LFP ) relate increase angiotensin-II ( Ang-II ) , decrease nitric oxide ( NO ) . NO deficit reverse Ang-II type-1 receptor ( AT1R ) blockade , ascorbic acid ( AA ) tetrahydrobiopterin skin suggest importance oxidative stress . Preliminary data also suggest couple sympathetic nerve activity blood vessel contraction enhance via ↑Ang-II ↓NO . We hypothesize due activation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) include superoxide , scavenge NO generate peroxynitrite , hydrogen peroxide . Combined measurement skin systemic circulation combine local measurement ROS production sympathetic nerve activity enable u determine precisely autonomic nervous system affect illness . Methods include cutaneous microdialysis measure ROS , skin biopsy blood test measure gene expression nitric oxide synthase Ang-II receptor , peroneal microneurography measure muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA ) . Combined ultrasonic femoral artery blood flow yield assessment interaction nerve blood vessel control . If discover specific biochemical mechanism POTS patient , may able specifically treat defect .</detailed_description>
