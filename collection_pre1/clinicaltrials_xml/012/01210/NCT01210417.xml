	<brief_summary>In prehospital setting would helpful assess primary change central blood volume preload ( venous return , stroke volume , diastolic ventricular volume ) occur stability phase follow injury regulatory mechanism still function . Obviously set non invasive bedside beat-to-beat index would helpful . Pulse Transit Time ( PTT ) sum Pre-Ejection Period ( PEP ) , time interval onset ventricular depolarization ventricular ejection , Vascular Transit Time ( VTT ) , time take pulse wave travel aortic valve peripheral artery ( Obrist et al . 1979 ) . PEP variation know correlate reduction central blood volume induce head-up tilt ( Chan et al. , 2007b , 2008 ) . The author also demonstrate PTT variation follow closely PEP variation therefore central blood volume variation ( Chan et al. , 2007b ) . Following central blood volume reduction induce head-up tilting ventricular diastolic filling time increase involve increase PEP PTT . Chan et al . ( Chan et al. , 2007b ) conclude PTT could use assess early central hypovolemia suggest joint analysis PTT RR interval could help predict extent blood volume loss . The investigator hypothesize sympathetic drive associate trauma would act cardiac contractility beta activity thus shorten PTT without reduce RR interval extent healthy heart . We also hypothesize progressive hypovolemia would lead rise PTT ( augment diastolic fill time ) RR interval shortening ( relative tachycardia ) . In study investigator propose index base beat-to-beat PTT/RR ratio assess central hypovolemia traumatic patient enrol Helicopter Emergency Medical System ( HEMS ) prehospital setting .</brief_summary>
