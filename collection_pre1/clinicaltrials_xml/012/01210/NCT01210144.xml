	<brief_summary>This Phase IV , pilot , open-label , national , multi-centric study plan determine gene expression profile histologic change endometrial tissue stimulation Gonal-f® . Physicians interested identify predictive genetic marker assist reproductive technology ( ART ) addition clinical predictive factor already know . Among predictive factor , state endometrium consider important implantation determine factor pharmacogenomic research great interest . The direct benefit study know whether endometrial gene expression profile modify response stimulation treatment impact endometrial tissue receptivity . The potential benefit study could assess therapy optimization base individual treatment response gene expression profile compare group treatment response infertile woman prediction response therapy base gene expression profile Gonal-f® stimulation infertile woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot open-label , national , multi-centre , Phase IV trial . This trial conduct outpatient . Once subject meet eligibility criterion , treat Gonal-f® prefilled pen receive randomization basis GnRH agonist antagonist . The follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) stimulation start day 2 menstrual cycle pre-defined fix dose 150 IU per day follicle recruit developed . Dose adjustment allow strictly case risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) . Ovulation trigger perform use single injection 250 mcg Ovitrelle® . Ultrasound scan ( US ) perform concomitantly hormonal assessment visit . Ovulation trigger soon least 3 follicle &gt; 16 mm , E2 &gt; 1 mcg/L agonist use . Oocyte retrieval , vitro fertilization ( IVF ) intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) blastocyst transfer perform per centre 's standard practice . Vaginal progesterone administer luteal phase subject ( 600 milligram per day [ mg/d ] ) . Hormonal assessment endometrial biopsy perform : - Day Luteinizing Hormone+7 ( `` LH+7 '' ) previous spontaneous cycle - Day Oocyte Retrieval ( OR ) stimulate cycle - Day `` OR+5 6 '' ( biopsy perform subject blastocyst ( ) transfer ) . Gene expression profile carry ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) endometrial tissue . As main objective trial determine gene expression profile endometrial tissue control ovarian stimulation Gonal-f® , minimum 2 endometrial sample per subject collect , 1 day LH+7 spontaneous cycle 1 stimulation , day OR . The subject follow 15 day last injection Investigational Medicinal Products ( IMPs ) safety assessment . For subject blastocyst implantation , pregnancy outcome record 12 week gestation pregnancy ongoing period . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To determine gene expression profile histological change endometrial tissue ( day LH + 7 spontaneous cycle ) stimulation Gonal-f® ( Day OR : 36 +/- 2 hour post r-hCG administration ) Assisted Reproductive Technology ( ART ) [ IVF/ICSI ] Secondary objective : - To correlate gene expression profile endometrial tissue Day LH + 7 spontaneous cycle blastocyst implantation rate subject undergoing ART Gonal-f® - To correlate gene expression profile histological change endometrial tissue stimulation Gonal-f® `` regulation '' protocol use ( agonist antagonist ) fertilization mode , IVF/ICSI - To correlate gene expression profile histological change endometrial tissue stimulation Gonal-f® accord hormonal status subject - To characterize gene expression profile histology endometrial tissue stimulation Gonal-f subject without blastocyst theoretical window implantation ( OR + 5 6 day ) - To characterize gene expression profile histology endometrial tissue good poor responder stimulation Gonal-f® Day OR ( response base follow criterion ) : 1 . Quantity mature oocytes retrieve : - Poor responder : 5 mature oocytes less - Good responder : 8 mature oocytes 2 . Quantity Gonal-f® use</detailed_description>
