	<criteria>1 . Women : A confirmed exonic mutation within αGalactosidase gene Men : A confirmed exonic mutation within αGalactosidas gene and/or reduce α Galactosidase activity 2 . Female patient ≥ 25 yearsold male patient ≥ 25 yearsold 3 . The patient receive enzyme replacement therapy treatment Fabry disease 4 . The patient must voluntarily sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) /Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) approve informed consent form relevant aspect study explain discussed patient 5 . The patient already mild symptom Fabry disease present least one minor organ involvement , e.g . proteinuria 1 , mild cardiac symptom need treatment yet , pain attack , gastrointestinal symptom history TIA . 1 . The patient receive ERT investigational product ( ) reason within 30 day prior study entry . 2 . Any contraindication MRIdiagnosis 3 . Incompatibility MRI contrast agent ( elevate serum creatinine accord SPC contrast medium ) The patient unable comply protocol , e.g. , clinically relevant medical condition make implementation protocol difficult ; uncooperative attitude ; unable return study evaluation ; otherwise unlikely complete study , determine investigator . 4 . Planned ERT within next 24 month ( nevertheless ERT become medically necessary observational period ERT might introduce )</criteria>
