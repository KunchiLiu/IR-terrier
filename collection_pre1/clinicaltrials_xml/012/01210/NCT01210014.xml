	<brief_summary>Recurrent aphthous stomatitis ( RAS ) one common oral mucosa disease affect approximately 20 % general population . Despite fact clinical , pathologic therapeutic feature disease comprehensively study , pathophysiology aphthous ulcer remain incompletely understood . Zinc potent catalyst wound heal zinc deficiency may common cause delayed tissue repair . Use zinc sulfate promotion wound heal preservation epithelial integrity advocate possible use treatment prevention recurrent oral ulcer . The purpose present study determine systemic zinc sulphate treatment recurrent aphthous stomatitis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recurrent aphthous stomatitis ( RAS ) chronic inflammatory disease man characterize painful ulceration recur vary frequency . The pathophysiology aphthous ulcer remain partly understood . The primary disorder appear result activation cell-mediated immune system . Aphthous ulcer may abnormalities cell communication epithelial integrity . The diagnosis aphthous ulcer primarily clinical . Aphthous ulcer occur area nonkeratinized mucosa mouth particularly buccal mucosa , labial mucosa , floor mouth , ventral surface tongue , soft palate . The treatment recurrent aphthous stomatitis ( RAS ) still remain unclear base mainly experimental data . The purpose therapy include management pain functional injury suppress inflammatory response , addition reduce frequency recurrence keep away onset new ulcer .Zinc identify important factor repair tissue.After considerable search zinc recognize beneficial impurity effective factor heal .The goal study present efficiency dietary zinc supplement rate Recurrent aphthous stomatitis healing .</detailed_description>
