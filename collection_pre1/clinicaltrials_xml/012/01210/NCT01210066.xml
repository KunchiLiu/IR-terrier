	<detailed_description>Both acute pain opioid administration show induce systemic pro-inflammatory response . However , presence inflammatory response unknown situation co-occurrence pain opioid administration exist common clinical case patient acute pain take opioid analgesic . A patient population combine effect pain opioids immune function particularly complex estimate 5.2 million Americans age 12 old abuse prescription opioids .
