	<brief_summary>Since radiation dose escalation large volume tumour inevitably induce high toxicity currently case , effort must make limit volume tissue irradiate . Moreover , irradiation large tumour volume lead low achievable tumour dose keep normal tissue dose constant . Central thus question whether would possible limit volume tumour boost selectively escalate radiation dose specific disease sit theoretically prone relapse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypoxia-guided Radiotherapy With Cisplatin-etoposide Stage I-III : Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxic image PET scan seem attractive purpose hypoxia associate resistance radiotherapy approximately 70 % SCLC severely hypoxic diagnosis [ 2 ] . We hypothesize might possible use selective boost patient tumor area still hypoxic end standard chemo-radiotherapy dose 45 Gy 30 fraction 3 week . This way SCLC ( small cell lung cancer ) patient receive safe , high dose radiotherapy whole tumor volume , resistant area receive high possible dose . This hypothesis generate trial design deliver least current standard treatment malignant tissue define patient selection criterion future study .</detailed_description>
