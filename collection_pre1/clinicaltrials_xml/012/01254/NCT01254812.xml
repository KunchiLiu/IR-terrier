	<brief_summary>TAP-block ( Transverse Abdominal Plane ) block method regional anesthesia use abdominal surgery . The method often apply ultra-sound guided . In department , so-called bilateral dual TAP-block ( BD-TAP-block ) develop . This include injection local anesthetic four site abdominal wall , aim best possible spread nerve block . Clinical experience show satisfy result pain relieve use nerve block , i.e sensory nerve abdominal wall successfully block . However , knowledge , clinical investigation regard effect muscle abdominal wall never execute . Patients chronic lung disease , prone catch pneumonia post surgery , may able use accessory muscle group prevent pulmonary phlegm stagnation . Therefore would inappropriate motor nerve supply muscle , affect nerve block . Our clinical experience far give u suspicion indication motor nerve become block , although nerve situate muscle layer sensory branch . Hence investigator would like examine healthy , male subject , whether application bilateral-dual TAP-block effect ability perform peak-flow inspiratory expiratory pressure . Our study hypothesis : There clinically relevant difference spread result pulmonary test ( peak flow et.c . ) application bilateral dual TAP-block .</brief_summary>
