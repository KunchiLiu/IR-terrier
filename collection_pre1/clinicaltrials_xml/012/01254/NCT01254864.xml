	<brief_title>Maximal Androgen Depletion Followed Randomization Maximal Androgen Ablation With Molecular Targeted Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Abiraterone acetate design block male hormone body may cause prostate cancer grow . Prednisone commonly give combination drug patient prostate cancer . In study , use combination abiraterone acetate order help prevent side effect abiraterone acetate may cause . Sunitinib malate design block pathway control important event growth blood vessel essential growth cancer . Dasatinib design change function gene . By change function gene , may prevent cancer grow spread . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take 4 tablet abiraterone acetate mouth every day . The tablet take , least 1 hour meal 2 hour meal . You also take 1 tablet prednisone mouth 2 time day . You take drug throughout entire study . If disease get bad take abiraterone acetate prednisone , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . - If assign Group 1 , start take sunitinib malate . You take 3 capsule mouth 1 time day , continue take abiraterone acetate prednisone . - If assign Group 2 , start take dasatinib . You take 2 tablet mouth 1 time day , continue take abiraterone acetate prednisone . Dasatinib tablet swallow whole , without meal . If accidentally miss take dose dasatinib , may take within 12 hour later . If vomit within 30 minute take tablet , dose may repeat . If miss dose due side effect , dose replace . If disease get bad assign group , still eligible continue take study drug , `` crossover '' group . If Group 1 , would stop take sunitinib malate begin take dasatinib . If Group 2 , would stop take dasatinib begin take sunitinib malate . No matter group crossover , continue take abiraterone acetate prednisone . Study Visits : At study visit , ask drug may receive side effect may . Every 2 week first 12 week take abiraterone acetate prednisone first 3 cycle ( 9-12 week ) new treatment combination , blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) collect test liver function . Every 4 week , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . Part blood use measure PSA level specific marker prostate cancer . - You ask question feel side effect may since last visit . - You ask drug may take . - Your performance status record . If disease get bad ( change treatment ) point study , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You bone marrow aspiration biopsy tumor tissue biopsy collect tumor tissue place tumor spread check status disease . - You ECG echocardiogram MUGA scan . - You chest x-ray , CT scan abdomen pelvis , bone scan check status disease . If doctor think necessary : - You chest x-ray , CT scan abdomen pelvis , bone scan check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You take study disease get bad crossover , experience intolerable side effect , doctor think best interest . End Treatment Visit : After stop receiving study drug reason , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test check PSA level , level specific marker prostate cancer , check protein related cancer . - You ask question feel side effect may since last visit . - You ask drug may take . - Your performance status record . - You bone marrow aspiration biopsy tumor tissue biopsy collect tumor tissue place tumor spread check status disease . Post-Treatment ( Safety ) Follow-Up Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may experience since last visit . - You ask drug may take . Long-Term Follow-Up : A member study staff check every 6 month Post-Treatment ( Safety ) Follow-Up Visit . This consist phone call , e-mail , review medical and/or record . If contact phone , call last minute . After End-of-Treatment visit , study staff contact phone , e-mail , come clinic visit . You ask feel side effect may . Each follow-up take 5 minute . Follow-up take place every 3 month first 2 year , every 6 month third year , 1 time year . The last follow-up 5 year last patient enrol . This investigational study . Prednisone FDA-approved commercially available . Abiraterone acetate FDA-approved commercially available , still research . Sunitinib malate FDA-approved treatment gastrointestinal tumor renal cell carcinoma , dasatinib FDA approve commercially available certain type leukemia . The use drug prostate cancer combination abiraterone acetate prednisone investigational . Up 180 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
