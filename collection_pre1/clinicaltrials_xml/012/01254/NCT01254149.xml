	<brief_title>IOP Lowering Effects Topical Anesthetics Used Frequently Ophthalmology Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each day almost patient ophthalmology clinic get intraocular pressure eye measure . This measurement use make important decision regard risk dilation also essential management glaucoma patient , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) remain one modifiable factor glaucoma . The intraocular pressure also measure eye undergone operative procedure pressure increase dangerous level signal need immediate intervention . In ophthalmology clinic intraocular pressure measure via Goldmann applanation tonometry , consider standard method measurement . The Goldmann tonometer device use applanation prism flatten small portion cornea measure eye . The pressure within eye determine much force need flatten cornea . In order perform test subject receive topical anesthetic fluorescein sodium dye surface eye . The intraocular pressure frequently measure ophthalmology pneumatonometry Tonopen . These two additional method contact tonometry measure amount force need displace cornea calculate intraocular pressure1 . Both require instillation topical anesthetic eye drop prior measure pressure , cut latter two method require dye . The principal anesthetic use United States proparacaine benoxinate . For Goldmann applanation , anesthetic must combine fluorescein dye . Both proparacaine benoxinate ester para-aminobenzoic acid ( PABA ) use topical ophthalmic anesthesia . Both onset action approximately 10-20 second duration action 10-20 minute . They provide sufficient anesthesia permit minor procedure involve superficial cornea conjunctiva . Proparacaine commonly use alone , purchase pre-mixed fluorescein dye , whereas , benoxinate available combination fluorescein dye1 . Fluorescein sodium yellow acid dye xanthenes family absorb light 493 nanometer wavelength ( blue ) emit fluoresces light 520 nanometer wavelength ( yellow-green ) . This dye ubiquitous ophthalmologic practice use intravenously topically assist make ophthalmologic diagnoses1 . For contact tonometry , one topical anesthetic traditionally instill eye intraocular pressure measure . This typically do technician first , question regard measurement repeat physician seeing patient . In academic institution intraocular pressure may also routinely check additional time resident . For certain patient suspect glaucoma intraocular pressure variation throughout day monitor call diurnal curve measurement . With test , intraocular pressure may check upwards ten ( 10 ) time single day ( measurement additional instillation topical anesthetic ) . All examination do minimal danger little discomfort patient . Despite standard protocol measurement intraocular pressure , suggest anesthetic agent use measure pressure may actually cause lower intraocular pressure . In rabbit proparacaine recently show reduce episcleral venous pressure , important component intraocular pressure , intraocular pressure ( Zamora ) . Attempts show pressure lower effect frequently use topical anesthetic human use traditional intraocular measurement device difficult three method mention require topical anesthetic . Some European study use non-contact tonometry verify finding . For example , Montero et al use non-contact tonometry determine effect topical anesthetic find statistically significant decrease intraocular pressure application topical anesthetic3 . Baudouin et al also find , measure via non-contact tonometry , topical anesthetic low intraocular pressure4 . In study topical anesthetic , oxybuprocaine betoxycaine use frequently United States . Both study do use non-contact tonometry . Traditionally non-contact tonometry , puff air direct towards corneal surface displacement corneal surface measure used estimate intraocular pressure . However , United States ophthalmology office rely contact tonometry evaluate intraocular pressure rather non-contact tonometry . Based review literature , one yet measure intraocular pressure lower effect topical anesthetic contact tonometry . There currently device market approve Food Drug Administration able measure intraocular pressure via contact tonometry require use topical anesthetic drop . This device sell ICare tonometer . The ICare tonometer use rebound technology light-weight probe use make momentary contact cornea . In rebound technology , motion parameter probe record measurement . An induction base coil system advance algorithms analyze probe deceleration , contact time parameter probe touch cornea . The deceleration rebound parameter change function intraocular pressure . The tonometer preprogrammed six measurement , discard high low intraocular pressure reading , calculate average pressure value . The pressure record millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) . No anesthesia involve touch probe gentle intraocular pressure measurement barely notice subject5 . The ICare currently use patient clinic traditional intraocular pressure measurement device appropriate like newborn infant . It require topical anesthesia recent data support intraocular pressure measurement reliable6,7 . Thus , ICare tonometer finally provide way use contact tonometry verify whether two commonly use topical anesthetic low intraocular pressure .</detailed_description>
