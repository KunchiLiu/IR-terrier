	<brief_title>Transoral Robotic Surgery Treating Patients With Benign Stage I-IV Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : To conduct pilot study City Hope ( COH ) assess feasibility safety TORS ( Transoral robotic surgery ) , include : total operative time , blood loss , hospitalization time , need convert open procedure , intra-operative well post-operative complication . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect data oncologic outcome , disease free survival , local control rate overall survival . II . To collect normative data regard objective functional outcome ( FO ) may impact quality life patient undergoing TORS , include need adjunctive procedure , gastrostomy tube placement tracheostomy placement , regard speech , swallow function pain , use patient-report outcome instrument . OUTLINE : Patients undergo transoral robotic microsurgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
