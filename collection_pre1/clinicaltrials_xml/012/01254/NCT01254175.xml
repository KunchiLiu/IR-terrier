	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immunogenicity Human Parainfluenza Type 3 ( HPIV3 ) Virus Vaccine Infants Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human parainfluenza virus cause serious respiratory tract disease infant child 5 year age , approximately 25 % child 5 year age experience clinically significant parainfluenza virus infection . HPIV3 , one four type parainfluenza virus , cause pneumonia , bronchiolitis , croup , bronchitis , virtually child experience primary HPIV3 infection time 3 4 year age . In United States , HPIV3 responsible approximately 11 % hospitalization respiratory diseases child . Because HPIV3-associated low respiratory illness typically occur first year life , need exist HPIV3 vaccine safe effective infant . The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity two dos live attenuate HPIV3 vaccine infant young child . This study enroll healthy , HPIV3 seronegative infant child 6 month 36 month age . Participants randomly assign receive either HPIV3 vaccine placebo vaccine . At baseline study visit , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , vital sign measurement , nasal wash procedure . They receive assign vaccine form nose drop . Participants remain study clinic 30 minute vaccination monitoring . Participants ' parent receive thermometer record participant ' temperature 18 day vaccination . Study staff call participant ' parent Days 1-18 , 84 , 112 , 140 monitor participant ' temperature medical status . Study visit occur 3 , 6 , 12 , 56 day vaccination , participant undergo similar test procedure vaccination visit ; blood collection also occur Day 56 . Six month first vaccination , participant return clinic receive second vaccination . All study procedure study visit follow first vaccination repeat , participant ' last follow-up visit occur 31 day second vaccination .</detailed_description>
