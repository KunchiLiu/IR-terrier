This study capture winter period Australia , China , Korea Taiwan , incidence exacerbation peak . Statistical analysis perform subject ' data derive PACE end-points . For primary endpoint , incidence COPD exacerbations 24 week accord baseline CAT quartile , adjust model use logistic regression take account demographic , lung function test parameter , medical history therapy history perform . This analysis also allow risk predictor determine . For quartile baseline CAT score , expect strict four equal interval CAT score since shape distribution curve CAT score linear , sigmoidal [ Jones , 2009 ] . The HEED data also show CAT score distribute evenly . Therefore , subject categorize quartile baseline CAT score collect ensure equal number subject group . The quartile 1 reference group . Odds ratio calculate compare group 1 group ( group 2 , 3 , 4 , respectively ) . The analysis also perform incidence moderate severe COPD exacerbation 24 week CAT quartile . Time first exacerbation accord baseline CAT quartile perform use Cox-regression , adjust demographic , lung function test parameter , medical therapy history . Hazard ratio calculate compare group ( group 2 , 3 , 4 ) group 1 . To determine risk predictor incidence COPD exacerbation , GEE ( Generalised Estimating Equations , repeat measure analysis categorical outcome ) perform . A sensitivity analysis various dichotomized definition number COPD exacerbation ( least 1 incident , 1 incident , etc ) also perform ROC ( Receiver Operator Characteristics ) GEE analyse . The correlation CAT score FEV1 MRC dyspnea score assess use Pearson 's correlation normality assumption satisfy . Otherwise non-parametric Spearman 's correlation present .</detailed_description>
