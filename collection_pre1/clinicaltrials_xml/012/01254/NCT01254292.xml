	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate user satisfaction tolerability young woman ( 18-29 year age ) use LCS12 compare young woman use COC ( Yasmin ) period 18 month . Subjects LCS12 arm offer continued use LCS12 full , intended duration use ( 3 year ) continue optional , extension phase . Safety data collect extension phase study . Secondary objective observe tolerability , discontinuation rate , adverse event profile , occurrence unintended pregnancy ( include calculation Pearl Index [ PI ] ) , bleed profile two birth-control method . Additionally , data miss tablet combine oral contraceptive ( COC ) group , intrauterine delivery system ( IUS ) expulsion LCS12 group record . In LCS12 group , physician satisfaction IUS inserter , evaluation visibility texture removal thread , evaluation visibility LCS12 ultrasound ( subset subject ) collect . Finally , COC group , information collect psychosocial impact miss delay pill intake .</brief_summary>
