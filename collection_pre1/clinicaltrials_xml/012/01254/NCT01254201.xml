	<brief_summary>Dry eye common complaint . In patient , identify reason dryness ; however , others dryness clear cause . Dryness lead eye irritation , redness , sometimes change vision . Fibromyalgia condition chronic pain poorly understood seem component alter sensory processing . People fibromyalgia tend complain dry irritated eye higher rate general population . We plan evaluate patient dry eye symptom abnormality sensory process autonomic nervous system . We hope learn possible relationship dry eye symptom fibromyalgia order well understand treat condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dry eye fibromyalgia syndrome prevalent woman . Therefore , female patient see Kellogg Eye Center ocular complaint dryness , grittiness , irritation , relate symptom , without identifiable cause , offer enrollment study . These individual compare `` positive control '' group ( fibromyalgia patient ) healthy control group . We hypothesize patient see irritative symptom autonomic sensory processing profile similar fibromyalgia patient , group differ healthy control . All study participant extensive ophthalmological exam addition autonomic sensory testing , order fully characterize underlie mechanism ( ) symptom . Recruitment : Female patient age 18 mention complaint tell study time visit . They give copy study consent form take home one mail . Additionally , CareWeb billing record , University Michigan Ophthalmologists , list patient previously see ( within last year ) Ophthalmology Comprehensive Clinic dry eye complaint identify contacted US mail recruitment letter upload . If patient interested , letter list research staff contact information , patient may contact . If patient contact research staff phone email , research staff may follow-up letter phone earlier one week mail . If patient interested , phone number list allow patient opt-out contact study phone future . Follow-up phone call utilize phone script . Patients interested participate contact study coordinator discussion see meet inclusion exclusion criterion schedule visit Cornea Clinic ophthalmic evaluation . At time visit , patient ask sign consent form give study identification number use exclusively patient identification study material . These patient schedule see Chronic Pain Fatigue Research Center Dominos Farms remain sensory autonomic testing . All patient study information collect encode accord HIPAA guideline institutional review board approval . The plan enroll 50 patient Group 1 12 month enrollment period . The study group compare two group age match patient , 25 know FM ( Group 2 ) 25 healthy control ( Group 3 ) . These patient identify search patient registry include 400 FM healthy control patient already undergone standardized sensory autonomic evaluation Chronic Pain Fatigue Research Center . The study coordinator contact individual identify registry meet criterion , ask interested enrol particular study ( individual registry give consent contact additional study eligible ) . FM patient control agree participate ask sign consent form schedule ophthalmic evaluation Cornea Clinic . Ophthalmic Evaluation : Individuals three group see Cornea Clinic Kellogg Eye Center receive complete ophthalmic evaluation include follow objective measure ocular visual sensation : - Visual acuity assess eye separately , use Snellen acuity chart distance Jaegar read card near vision . Additional notation make subjective evaluation patient 's level satisfaction correct acuity test . - Shirmer 's test anesthesia perform patient . This test involve use small strip filter paper place low eyelid instillation anesthetic eyedrop assessment tear production . - Corneal fluorescein conjunctival lissamine green stain pattern assess measure ocular surface integrity . Staining measure use Oxford grade scale 0 ( stain ) 5 ( severe stain ) - Tear break time evaluate fluorescein stain still eye . The patient instruct blink tear film observe slit lamp . If smooth layer tear film begin visibly break prior 10 second , patient 's tear film consider abnormal . - Ocular complaint quantify use Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire - validate 15 question survey evaluate dry eye symptom well National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire - validate 25 question survey evaluate overall visual function . - Accommodation , ability shift visual focus distance near , measure Marco auto-refractor separately eye . Accommodation physiologic measure eye 's ability shift focus naturally decrease age . - Central corneal sensation measure use Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometry . The esthesiometer instrument comprise slender nylon filament retract 0.5 cm increment filament sense cornea . - Confocal Microscopy - The patient ' eye viewed use high power microscope carefully evaluate corneal nerve layer . This microscope look layer cornea ( window ) eye . After numb drop place eye , gel lubricate also place eye . The microscope come close proximity eye . The patient feel microscope his/her eyelash look red light . Three scan provide clear view sub-epithelial corneal nerve layer perform patient . Sensory Autonomic Evaluation : Patients see Chronic Pain Fatigue Research Center Dominos Farms evaluate several modality measure alter sensory processing autonomic dysfunction : - Questionnaires demographic disease status information collect use general form include age , sex , race , marital status , education level , ethnicity , chronicity pain , believe cause pain , event associate onset pain . Participants also complete battery self-report questionnaire characterize functional status , pain fatigue symptom , cognitive difficulty , affective status , pain belief , perceive stress , perceive social support , cop strategy , sleep quality , history abuse . The questionnaire battery take approximately 1 hour complete . - Pressure pain sensitivity assess thumbnail use hydraulic device consist plastic housing piston drive hard rubber 1 cm2 probe . After position device leave thumb , subject receive ascend series discrete 3 second-duration pressure stimuli begin 0.5 kg increase 0.5 kg step maximum 10 kg ( subjective maximum le 10 kg ) . Subjects rate intensity evoke sensation use sensory intensity Box scale , combine analog descriptor scale superimpose verbal descriptor , space accord ratio-scale value , 0-20 graphical numerical category scale.22,23 The pain test session last 45 minute . - Tender point assessment : standard mean confirm diagnosis fibromyalgia . During assessment , examiner use thumb apply minimal pressure pre-designated body point ( base neck , back arm ) ask patient sensitive 'tender ' various point . Most individual describe assessment painful . - Auditory sensitivity test involves hear screening perform accord American Speech-Language-Hearing Association guidelines.24 This include brief case history , otoscopic inspection , 25 dB HL pure-tone screen 1000 , 2000 4000 Hz 35 dB HL 500 Hz . This testing assure hearing abnormality would cause abnormality research test interest , Judgment Loudness Discomfort Levels ( LDLs ) . This test perform use pure tone acoustic stimulus octave frequency 2000 Hz signal range 40 100 dB . The patient instructed indicate rating discomfort volume acoustic signal present . This test perform ascend step-wise random order pattern , take approximately 45 minute . Each patient also complete hyperacusis questionnaire,25 indicate experience real-life auditory sensitivity . - Dysautonomia assess centrally monitoring variation heart rate . Heart rate variability information obtain use Holter monitor . Individuals remain supine first 5 minute examination . For remain time period ( total : approximately 60 minute ) , Holter monitor record continuous electrocardiogram ( ECG ) heart 's electrical activity response vary standardize study relate task questionnaire completion , discussion study personnel , listen instruction . Frequency domain analysis use fast Fourier transformation yield information amount variance ( power ) heart 's rhythm explain periodic oscillation heart rate various band , include high , low , low frequencies.26 Fluctuations time interval normal heartbeat record quantified analysis variability beat .</detailed_description>
