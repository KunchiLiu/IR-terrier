	<detailed_description>Primary Aims 1 . Test efficacy telephone-adapted Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( tMBSR ) program reduce symptom improve quality life kidney transplant candidate 8-weeks 6-month follow-up . 2 . Evaluate impact tMBSR sleep measure actigraphy , physiologic stress , indicate alteration slope diurnal salivary cortisol , measured end 8-week active intervention period . Secondary Aims 1 . Evaluate impact tMBSR perception transplant surgery ( treatment satisfaction , pain ) Health Related Quality Life ( HRQL ) 2- , 6- 12-mos post-transplant surgery . 2 . Design full-scale randomized control trial ( RCT ) effectiveness cost-effectiveness tMBSR . Hypotheses - Primary : The tMBSR group report well outcomes attention control support group ( SG ) standardize scale anxiety , depression , sleep quality health-related quality life 8 week 6 month follow-up . - Secondary : The tMBSR group report well outcomes SG group actigraphy-derived sleep parameter diurnal salivary cortisol pattern . - Tertiary : Candidates attend mindfulness train report great treatment satisfaction , less distress pain transplant surgery well HRQL 2 month , 6 month 1 year kidney transplantation . Rationale study : For patient live kidney failure , wait new kidney stressful time . Pharmacologic therapies manage symptom stress increase risk side effect non-adherence . Mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , non-pharmacologic program training mindfulness meditation , could help patient reduce symptom distress without increase risk . Long-range Goal : To develop evidence-based recommendation non-pharmacologic strategy provide symptom relief transplant patient , safe , practical cost-effective .

An experienced facilitator emphasize communication skill group support . Recruiting Methods : 1 . Direct mail candidate follow Transplant Information Services Office follow-up call ; invitation letter brochures sent P01 Clinical Core . 2 . Posters flyer medical clinic . 3 . Referral health provider - in- service presentation pre-transplant coordinator manage kidney candidate ; 4 . Additional invitation letter mail coordinator maintains waitlist United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) ; study brochure invitation letter mail waitlist acceptance letter . Potential Measures intervention 'dose ' enactment : 1 . Mindfulness scale : Mindful Awareness Attention Scale ( MAAS ) ; 2 . Meditation practice time . Exploratory Outcomes : Post-transplant impact Quality Life ( QOL ) Short-Form-36 item ( SF-36 ) , pain satisfaction transplant hospitalization . Evaluation Methods : 1 . Self-report , mail questionnaire complete study week 0 , 8 , 26 ( primary outcome QOL measure ) , 2 . Actigraphy record 1 week prior intervention last week intervention ; cortisol collection 3 day time period . 3 . Post transplant evaluation - 2 6 mo ; 1 year coordinate Transplant Database Duration Treatment : 8 week Study Duration : Participants follow one year post-kidney transplant . Statistical Considerations : This study power compare MBSR SG , primary endpoint , State Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , 8 week . Randomization may stratify dialysis ( yes/no ) history diabetes ( yes/no ) .</detailed_description>
