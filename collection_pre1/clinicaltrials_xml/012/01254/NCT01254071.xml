	<detailed_description>Description : This study open-label , randomize , single dose , two-period crossover study determine bioavailability fix dose combination capsule formulation dutasteride tamsulosin hydrochloride ( 0.5mg/0.2mg ) relative co-administration dutasteride 0.5mg capsule tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.2mg tablet healthy male subject North East Asian non-Asian ancestry . Subjects receive single oral dos combination capsule formulation dutasteride 0.5 mg/ tamsulosin 0.2 mg feed fasted state concomitant dose dutasteride 0.5 mg Japan-sourced Harnal-D 0.2 mg feed fasted state . Each dose study medication separate 28-day washout period . Blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis take regular interval dose . Safety assess measurement blood pressure , heart rate , safety laboratory data , review adverse event . The study enrol 88 healthy male subject ensure 80 complete study . At least twenty percent study population Japanese ancestry , approximately 20 % Chinese ancestry approximately 20 % Korean ancestry remainder population non-Asian ancestry . Background : Dutasteride ( AVODART â„¢ ) approve potent 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor indicate treatment symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) men enlarge prostate improve symptom , reduce risk acute urinary retention reduce risk need BPH-related surgery [ AVODART Package Insert , 2009 ] . In human , dutasteride well-tolerated single dos 40mg/day , multiple dos 40mg/day administer 7 day , 5mg/day administer 24 week . In clinical study , overall incidence type adverse event ( AEs ) similar across dutasteride , placebo , finasteride treatment group . Tamsulosin ( Harnal , Harnal D , Flomax ) alpha-1-adrenoceptor block agent approve treatment sign symptoms benign prostatic hyperplasia . Tamsulosin HCl extensively metabolize , less 10 % dose excrete urine unchanged [ Harnal , 2009a ; Harnal , 2009b ; Flomax , 2009 ] . In human liver microsome human lymphoblastoid cell express CYP cDNAs vitro , tamsulosin HCl metabolize CYP3A4 CYP2D6 [ Matsushima , 1998 ] . Clinical data exist support tamsulosin ( alpha-1-adrenoceptor antagonist ) , use combination dutasteride ( 5-alpha reductase inhibitor ) , offer effective treatment symptom benign prostatic hyperplasia either drug use alone [ GSK study ARI40005 , GlaxoSmithKline document number HM2002/00171/01 ] . In addition , data large , multi-centre National Institutes Health-sponsored Medical Therapy Prostatic Symptoms ( MTOPS ) study reveal great benefit combination alpha-1-adreoceptor antagonist 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy compare either monotherapy male BPH [ McConnell , 2002 ] . Clinical drug interaction study show pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic interaction dutasteride tamsulosin . Dutasteride may administer without food . Tamsulosin administer food . While food effect PK data dutasteride tamsulosin administer individually , objective study evaluate effect food ( high fat meal state versus fast state ) absorption dutasteride tamsulosin HCl give combination capsule formulation relative co-administration two component , dutasteride tamsulosin HCl . A previous study , ARI109882 , [ GlaxoSmithKline document number ZM2007/00022/00 ] , also determine bioequivalence food effect combination capsule formulation relative co-administration component administer separately . In study , GSK combination capsule find bioequivalent ( feed fast condition ) market product administer separately . In present study , dose tamsulosin HCl administer low ARI109882 ( 0.2 mg versus 0.4mg administer ARI109882 ) . The dose dutasteride study ( 0.5mg ) .</detailed_description>
