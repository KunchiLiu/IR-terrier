	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate feasibility two different chemotherapy protocol adjust dos patient age 75 often medical problem prostate cancer . Patient receive Docetaxel either every 3 week weekly . In case , chemotherapy combine prednisone . The protocol consider feasible patient receive 6 cycle chemotherapy ( 1 cycle = 3 week ) . Additionally primary objective , efficacy also evaluate protocol well tolerance treatment , quality life evolution geriatric data .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Chemotherapy With Docetaxel-Prednisone Castration-resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard management castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer represent chemotherapy Docetaxel 75 mg/m² every 3 week combine Prednisone since symptomatic overall survival benefit demonstrate . Although benefit independent age study Tannock ( cut-off:69 ) , seem possible extrapolate result , obtain select population , majority patient encounter daily practice , &gt; = 75 year old / unfit . Retrospective study show chemotherapy feasible , standard adapt dos unselected elderly population good result term tolerance efficacy symptom . Our study aim evaluate prospectively feasibility chemotherapy Docetaxel/Prednisone administer every 3 week ( 60 mg / m² D1C1 70 mg / m² D1 subsequent cycle tolerance good ) weekly ( 35mg / m² D1 D8 Day 1 = Day 21 ) patient &gt; = 75 year old , evaluate comprehensive geriatric assessment , belong group 2 `` vulnerable '' group 3 `` frail '' classification propose International Society Geriatric Oncology ( SIOG ) . Feasibility define possibility patient receive 6 cycle chemotherapy without withdrawal . Reasons study withdrawal define GERICO Group following : - stop delay chemotherapy &gt; 2 week - Necessity reduce dose chemotherapy &gt; 25 % - febrile neutropenia non-haematological grade 3 toxicity ( except alopecia ) accord NCI-CTCAE V4.0 . - Geriatric criterion ( Activity Daily Living ( ADL ) decrease &gt; = 2 point ) The statistical methodology use double randomized phase II stratification accord SIOG criterion , base Simon Optimum plan . A pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic study associate project , base method population pharmacokinetic . The aim highlight predictor haematological tolerance chemotherapy evaluate clinical , geriatric biological parameter . The result study support term prescription chemotherapy , patient age 75 , classify `` vulnerable '' `` frail '' regard SIOG criterion , define geriatric assessment .</detailed_description>
