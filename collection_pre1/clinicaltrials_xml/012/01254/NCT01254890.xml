	<brief_title>Sorafenib 5-Azacitidine Acute Leukemia + Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Sorafenib design block function important protein cancer cell . These protein , active , partly responsible abnormal growth behavior cancer cell . 5-Azacytidine design activate ( `` turn '' ) certain gene cancer cell whose job fight tumor . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive 5-azacytidine either skin vein Days 1-7 28-day cycle . If vein , infusion take 10-40 minute . You take sorafenib mouth 2 time day 12 hour apart , water empty stomach , every day . Each study cycle may last little long 28 day , depend . Study Visits : Every week , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Every week first 6 week , often doctor think need , blood pressure measure . Before cycle : - Your performance status record . - You physical exam , include measurement blood pressure weight . Before every 2-4 cycle , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment follow-up visit . End Study Drug Administration Visit : After stop take study drug , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - Your performance status record . - You physical exam , include measurement blood pressure weight . - You bone marrow aspirate collect check status disease . This investigational study . Sorafenib FDA approve commercially available kidney cancer liver cancer . 5-Azacitidine FDA approve treatment MDS , combination sorafenib investigational . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
