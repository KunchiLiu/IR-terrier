	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together cetuximab treat patient colorectal cancer head neck cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , use substance make live organism may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Giving lenalidomide together cetuximab may better treatment colorectal cancer head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Cetuximab Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose lenalidomide give combination cetuximab patient advance colorectal squamous cell head neck cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response refractory V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) wild-type colorectal head/neck cancer monitor measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . II . To measure antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity ( ADCC ) patient receive lenalidomide plus cetuximab . III . To measure natural killer cell cytokine production patient receive lenalidomide plus cetuximab . IV . To describe fragment c gamma receptor polymorphism . ( Exploratory ) V. To describe baseline immune cell function . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lenalidomide . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week .</detailed_description>
