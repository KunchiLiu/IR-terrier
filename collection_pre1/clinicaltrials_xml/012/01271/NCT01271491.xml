	<brief_summary>Bronchiolitis potentially severe infection airway infant child , among frequent diagnosis lead pediatric intensive care unit admission infant . This acute infection cause array virus , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) frequently implicate . The majority infant hospitalize bronchiolitis previously healthy , half infant intubate mechanically ventilated respiratory failure due RSV bronchiolitis previously identify risk factor . It likely , therefore , factor , particularly genetic heterogeneity host , contribute disease severity . However , previous study investigate association genetic variant respiratory failure child bronchiolitis . Several category candidate gene emerge potentially important pathogenesis disease . Specifically , genetic polymorphism surfactant , pattern recognition receptor , receptor adhesion molecule , cytokine examine . The aim evaluate polymorphism determine association respiratory failure cohort severely ill child bronchiolitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Genetics Respiratory Failure Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct prospective observational study infant child admit bronchiolitis determine genetic polymorphism number likely candidate immune response relate gene positively associate respiratory failure population . Respiratory failure define require intubation mechanical ventilation . We plan enroll two group child , admit ICU respiratory failure due bronchiolitis ( case ) child admit ward less severe bronchiolitis infection ( control ) . In special circumstance , also enroll pair twin hospitalize bronchiolitis ( ICU ward ) , either one twin meet inclusion criterion case control and/or able obtain DNA blood sample hospitalize ( twin inpatient population ) . Demographic data , data regard hospital treatment course child collect . Blood , saliva sputum genotyping also obtain . If patient enrol control need intubate , child control patient , instead would consider case . We propose compare population 100 child respiratory failure due bronchiolitis population 100 child bronchiolitis without respiratory failure . Clinical characteristic genetic marker compare . We also compare clinical characteristic genetic marker twin pair enrol .</detailed_description>
