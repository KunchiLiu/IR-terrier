	<detailed_description>Primary Objective ( ) : To evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety ( acute effect associate infusion , inhibitor development ) efficacy ( breakthrough bleed control hemorrhage prophylaxis ) IB1001 previously treat pediatric subject hemophilia B . Acute effect define adverse event ( AEs ) occur within first 72 hour administration study product . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To obtain tolerance compliance information pediatric subject response intravenously deliver recombinant factor IX product , IB1001 2 . To evaluate safety IB1001 50 exposure day treatment course Investigators/Study Centers : This international study conduct clinical site locate United States ( USA ) , Europe , Mexico India Phase Development : Phase 3/4 Planned Sample Size : Up 22 pediatric subject ( &lt; 12 year age ) enrol order 20 subject complete study . Study Duration : The study duration approximately 6 month per subject include minimum 50 exposure IB1001 . Study Design : The study non-randomized , open label design include initial pharmacokinetics evaluation participant , follow six month ( 50 exposure day ) treatment .</detailed_description>
