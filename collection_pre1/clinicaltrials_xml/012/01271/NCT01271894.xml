	<brief_summary>Safety efficacy key issue antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) selection . Efavirenz ( EFV ) important component combination ART treatment naive individual . Like many drug , inter-individual difference efficacy tolerability EFV . The Encore1 study provide opportunity examine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ( process drug absorbed , distribute , metabolize , eliminate body ) EFV blood sample collect 24-hour dose interval participant receive either standard 600 mg reduce 400 mg dose EFV daily .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Intensive Pharmacokinetics Sub-study Encore1 ( ENCORE1-PK )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This sub-study investigate relationship dosage , EFV plasma concentration , toxicity virological efficacy . EFV concentration dry blood spot match plasma evaluate determine utility dry blood spot measurement measure EFV plasma concentration . Measurements dry blood spot could potentially cheap easy alternative measurement plasma . Dried blood spot easily collect venous blood fingerprick , need plasma separation potentially need less stringent storage condition shipment .</detailed_description>
