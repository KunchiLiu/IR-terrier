	<brief_summary>A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase III study regorafenib plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care subject metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) whose disease progress despite prior treatment least imatinib sunitinib . The study compose 3 period : A Screening Period , Treatment Period , Survival Follow Period . Subjects randomize treated regorafenib receive 160 mg po od 3 week every 4 week ( 28 day ) cycle ( ie , 3 week on/1 week ) . In addition subject receive best supportive care exclude disease specific anti cancer therapy kinase inhibitor , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery . Tumor assessment every 4 week first 3 month , every 6 week next 3 month ( month 6 ) , every 8 week end treatment , frequently clinically indicate . Tumor assessment include CT MRI perform tumor progression see central radiology review . Subjects receive placebo experience disease progression may offer active treatment . Subjects experience progression regorafenib treatment may continue open label treatment . All subject enter Survival Follow-up Period upon discontinuation randomize study treatment .</brief_summary>
