	<detailed_description>Over past several decade , considerable effort expend toward successful cryopreservation various human cell . While attempt cryopreservation direct different tissue type , one vigorously pursue target reproductive tissue . Historically , cryopreservation human sperm exist several decade . The early report pregnancy ( Trounson et al. , 1983 ) birth ( Zeilmaker et al. , 1984 ) cryopreservation human embryo occur early 1980s . Presently , freeze storage human embryo follow vitro fertilization ( IVF ) standard practice fertility clinic . In 2003 , CDC Assisted Reproductive Technology success rate report state 4,246 live birth occur 17,517 non-donor frozen embryo cycle . Embryo cryopreservation routine component clinical IVF program 2 decade relatively poor outcome term post-thaw survival pregnancy rate majority IVF program . Efficient embryo cryopreservation several advantage . It help reduce cost increase cumulative pregnancy rate . It also help case IVF cycle embryos transfer due ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome . It also useful technical difficulty encounter time embryo transfer procedure . One major concern IVF high-order multiple pregnancy , result transfer multiple embryo give cycle . In last 5 year , improve stimulation protocol , advance culture laboratory system , good identification viable embryo enhance success rate IVF . During period , clinic start practice transfer two embryos reduce multiple pregnancy rate without compromise overall pregnancy rate . Furthermore , recent year European country , particularly Scandinavian country , take lead perform elective single-embryo transfer achieve acceptable pregnancy rate . This trend spread country . This result surplus embryo available freezing . With application ICSI , even patient age 40 year old may embryos freeze . Review current literature reveals modest post-thaw embryo survival , implantation , pregnancy rate . Post-thaw survival rate vary 50 % 80 % different embryo stage . Implantation pregnancy rate vary 3 % 15 % 15 % 25 % respectively , approximately half rate achieve fresh embryo transfer . To improve outcome frozen ET cycle , modify various step standard cryopreservation protocol . In pilot study arrest fragmented embryo ( grade 3 4 ) , achieve post-thaw survival rate 92 % , blastomeres intact . Encouraged post-thaw survival embryo ; propose use modify protocol frozen embryo transfer program .</detailed_description>
