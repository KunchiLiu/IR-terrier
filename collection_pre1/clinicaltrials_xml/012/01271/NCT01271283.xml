	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Treating Patients With High-Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time progression patient high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) treat lenalidomide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical response ( complete partial response ) treatment-naïve patient high-risk CLL treat single-agent lenalidomide . II . To determine incidence immune-mediated flare reaction . III . To determine toxicity profile single-agent lenalidomide previously untreated patient high-risk CLL . IV . To conduct correlative study bone marrow , peripheral blood , and/or lymph node patient treat lenalidomide . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( morphological criterion persistent minimal residual disease molecular criterion ) partial response may continue treatment beyond 8 course . Patients may undergo bone marrow , peripheral blood , and/or lymph node sample collection baseline periodically study correlative study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month maximum 5 year .</detailed_description>
