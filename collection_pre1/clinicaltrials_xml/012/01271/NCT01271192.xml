	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Surgical resection adjuvant therapy become main treatment resectable local recurrent rectal cancer . However efficacy safety adjuvant therapy still unknown . PURPOSE : This randomized multicenter clinical trial study surgical resection follow chemo radiotherapy neoadjuvant chemo radiotherapy follow surgery postoperative chemotherapy , compare see efficacy safety , investigate effect adjuvant chemoradiotherapy resectable local recurrent rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Neoadjuvant Treating Patients With Resectable Local Recurrent Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare 5-year survival rate patient resectable local recurrent rectal cancer treat either surgical resection neoadjuvant . Secondary - Compare side effect chemo radiotherapy accord Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) version 2.0 patient treated regimen . - Compare postoperative complication patient treat regimen . - Compare recurrent rate patient treat regimen . - Compare distant metastatic rate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter clinical trial . Patients stratify accord participate center , gender , age . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive surgical resection undergo FOLFIRI 12 cycle , 2-4 week operation . Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 5-6 week , 8-12 week operation . - Arm II : Patients receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( mFOLFIRI 5 cycle undergo radiotherapy arm I second cycle FOLFIRI ) , surgery FOLFORI 7 cycle 2-4 week operation . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month least 3 year . The side effect chemo radiotherapy , postoperative complication , recurrent rate , distant metastatic rate 5-year survival rate investigate . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 360 patient accrue study within 5 year .</detailed_description>
