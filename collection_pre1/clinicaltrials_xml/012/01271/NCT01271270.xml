	<brief_summary>Background : - Wet age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) occur abnormal blood vessel grow back eye , leak blood fluid damage eye , produce scar , lead blindness . People diagnose wet AMD increase production body chemical call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . VEGF important formation blood vessel body , decrease production VEGF believe help wet AMD patient prevent slow growth abnormal blood vessel . Anti-VEGF drug use decrease production VEGF , people respond completely drug . - A protein body call mTOR also play critical role regulate cell divide grow obtain blood supply . The experimental chemical Palomid 529 inhibits production mTOR . Researchers interested determine whether Palomid 529 safe help individual wet AMD completely respond anti-VEGF treatment . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness Palomid 529 treatment wet age-related macular degeneration individual respond standard anti-VEGF treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals wet age-related macular degeneration least one eye respond standard anti-VEGF treatment . Design : - Prior first visit , participant see National Eye Institute clinic screen teach protocol , NIH protocol 08-EI-0103 , High Speed Indocyanine Green Angiography Findings Induction Regimen Intravitreal Ranibizumab Injection Neovascular Age Related Macular Degeneration . One eye designate study eye receive Palomid 529 treatment . - Participants full physical examination medical history , full eye examination evaluate eye health vision , angiography examine blood vessel eye , blood urine test study - Participants receive injection Palomid 529 study eye every 4 week study , total three injection . Participants may also receive anti-VEGF injection ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) bevacizumab ( Avastin ) study eye 12 day 12 day Palomid 529 injection . - Participants may standard-of-care treatment non-study eye wet AMD well , may receive experimental treatment non-study eye study . - Participants return long-term follow-up examination direct study researcher .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Paloma Pharmaceuticals , Inc. develop non-steroidal , wholly synthetic , small molecule drug application diseases aberrant neovasculature , know Palomid 529.1 Palomid 529 exerts broad activity anti-angiogenic agent inhibit mammalian target rapamycin ( Akt/mTor ) signal transduction pathway via dissociation target rapamycin complex ( TORC1 TORC2 ) immune system . The objective study evaluate safety tolerability Palomid 529 administer subconjunctival injection participant choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) secondary neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . Study Population : This study enroll participant neovascular AMD respond conventional anti-VEGF treatment . Five participant initially accrue ; however , seven participant meet eligibility criterion may enrol . Design : This 12-week , unmasked , non-randomized study three serial 1.9 mg subconjunctival dose Palomid 529 neovascular AMD participant respond conventional anti-VEGF treatment . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome determine safety subconjunctival Palomid 529 neovascular AMD . Safety outcomes include number severity ocular systemic adverse event . Secondary efficacy outcome include change best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) , change fluid status , central retinal thickness retinal volume measure optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , change leakage pattern observe fluorescein angiography ( FA ) , change CNV pattern observe indocyanine green angiography ( ICG ) , change autofluorescence pattern observe fundus autofluorescence ( FAF ) imaging , change fundus appearance observe color fundus photography . Additionally , Complement Factor H polymorphism compare treatment response pharmacokinetic sample collect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>STUDY EYE INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Participant must active neovascular AMD least one eye ( study eye ) define follow criterion : CNV set AMD result fluid blood within macula determine clinical examination , OCT FA . The study eye respond conventional antiVEGF treatment ( define eye persistent intraretinal cyst great linear dimension least 100 micron and/or subretinal fluid pocket height least 100 micron and/or presence foveal fluid four serial antiVEGF intravitreal injection ) . The fluid state determine two week ( plus minus two day ) last injection . 2 . Participant must reasonably clear medium fixation allow good quality OCT fundus photography . 3 . Participant must visual acuity 20 40 bad study eye . Participants meet eligibility criterion visual acuity 20 32 20 40 may enrol disease consider visionthreatening determine investigator ( i.e. , persistent fluid fovea respond standardofcare antiVEGF treatment ) . INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant must 18 year age old . Participant must understand sign protocol inform consent document . Female participant childbearing potential must pregnant lactating , must negative pregnancy test screening must willing undergo pregnancy test throughout study . Women childbearing potential must agree use reliable method contraception study period three month follow last injection . Acceptable method contraception include hormonal contraception ( i.e. , birth control pill , inject hormone , dermal patch vaginal ring ) , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicide ( diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide ) surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , tubal ligation partner vasectomy ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant actively receive another investigational study therapy . Participation NIH protocol 08EI0103 , High Speed Indocyanine Green Angiography Findings Induction Regimen Intravitreal Ranibizumab Injection Neovascular AgeRelated Macular Degeneration allow , s/he enrol least one year , image study provide standardofcare ranibizumab . Participant unable comply study procedure followup visit . Participant evidence ocular disease neovascular AMD study eye may confound outcome study ( i.e. , diabetic macular edema , myopic choroidal neovascularization uveitic macular edema ) . Participant evidence retinal pigment epithelial detachment ( unless subretinal intraretinal fluid present ) study eye . Participant receive antiVEGF injection study eye within 12 day prior enrollment . Participant receive receive intraocular steroid study eye within four month prior enrollment . Participant receive receive immunosuppressive treatment ( i.e. , biologic systemic steroid ) within two month prior enrollment . If participant systemic immunosuppressive treatment least two month prior enrollment meet enrollment criterion residual fluid four serial antiVEGF injection , s/he eligible participate study long s/he continue specific systemic drug regimen entire study period . Participant allergic fluorescein dye indocyanine green dye . Participant allergic shellfish iodine .</criteria>
