	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1. determine whether MSCT screen method HL survivor treat mediastinal irradiation accurately identify asymptomatic significant coronary artery disease . 2. establish prevelance coronary abnormality HL survivor treat mediastinal irradiation 3. determine frequency type intervention 4. evaluate acceptance screening asses quality life among Hl survivor . Study polulation : 50 long term survivor HL , previously treatef mediastinal irradiation without present evidence cardiovascular disease Intervention : CT-coronary angiography calcium score , perform screen method ( indicate diagnostic treatent procedure )</detailed_description>
