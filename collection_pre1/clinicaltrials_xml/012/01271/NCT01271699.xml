	<brief_summary>The association Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) Fabry disease know clinical experience well case report literature , symptom suspicious result brain MRI lead misdiagnosis Fabry patient MS . Remarkably , patient almost never show oligoclonal band intrathecally derive IgG-production wrongly assume due misinterpretation CSF result . Where oligoclonal band present , concomitant diagnosis discuss . Furthermore , patient show involvement spinal cord , evidence MRI . Beside possible complication not-effective not-necessary MS therapy , patient risk irreparable organ damage due delay implementation enzyme replacement therapy Fabry disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fabry disease X-linked lysosomal disorder lead excessive deposition neutral glycosphingolipids vascular endothelium several organ body . Progressive endothelial accumulation glycosphingolipids account associated clinical abnormality skin , eye , kidney , heart , brain , peripheral nervous system . Fabry disease manifest predominantly men . Female heterozygotes also present feature Fabry disease . In Europe prevalence Fabry disease seem massively underrepresented . Multiple Sclerosis ( MS , Encephalomyelitis disseminata ) ist common inflammatory disease central nervous system ( CNS ) . The first clinical manifestation peak 3rd-4th decade . 2.5 million Young adult affect worldwide . In Germany prevalence rate reach approx . 100 patient per 100,000 inhabitant . Females frequently affect ( 2-3:1 ) . The underlying cause disease sufficiently explore yet . The genetic background well environmental factor involve . An autoimmune mediate process , driven activate T-lymphocytes macrophage , lead inflammatory demyelination axonal loss . Magnetresonance image brain spinal cord , evaluation cerebrospinal fluid detect intrathecally derive immunoglobulin production ( IgG ) comprehensive diagnostic workup possible cause symptom . The modern diagnostic criterion ( McDonald criterion , 2001 + revision 2005 ) demand proof dissemination inflammatory process space time , either clinical radiological term . The evaluation cerebrospinal fluid aim confirmation intrathecally derive synthesis IgG . In 98 % patient oligoclonal band detected course disease . This parameter highly sensitive low specific . The diagnostic criterion allow make diagnosis `` certain '' least `` probable '' MS without confirmation oligoclonal band .</detailed_description>
