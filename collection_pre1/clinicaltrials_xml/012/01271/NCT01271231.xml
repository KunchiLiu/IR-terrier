	<brief_summary>Diabetes metabolic disorder affect uptake glucose cell . This cause cascade systemic alteration may lead kidney failure , cardiovascular complication , alter tissue healing , retinopathy gangrene . Diabetes also associate increased susceptibility infection inflammation . It observe diabetic patient suffer often oral infection periodontal disease . Periodontal disease infectious-inflammatory disease lead destruction surround tissue tooth . It propose mechanisms responsible systemic complication implicate development periodontal disease . This evaluated study diabetic patient show increased level inflammatory cytokine , subgingival bacteria limited response treatment . Its also suggest establish periodontitis diabetic patient lead insulin resistance due infection liberation cytokine periodontal tissue thus worsen diabetic condition . This study aim establish response periodontal treatment antibiotic kinetics glucose level diabetic patient .</brief_summary>
