	<brief_summary>Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy ( ARVC ) inherit condition characterize life threaten heart racing , present palpitation , cardiac arrest ( collapse require ambulance ) sudden death . The disease affect right ventricle , part heart pump blood lung . ARVC diagnose wide range test focus pump function electrical signal right ventricle . These factor summarize score form ARVC Task Force Criteria . Genetic test identify 5 different gene lead ARVC , detect 60 % patient ARVC . This allow doctor test family member patient ARVC determine risk develop condition . Currently , family member undergo test include image electrical test 24-hour monitor determine evidence ARVC . With increase frequency , family member find gene may lead ARVC , little evidence heart affect . This may family member young develop condition , factor understand protect developing . The PREPARE study study 100 patient carry gene lead ARVC , anything minor evidence condition present . These patient heart race initial 24-hour monitor . These patient undergo long term monitoring implanted heart monitor insert minor surgical procedure , detect abnormal heart rhythm may provide clue heart race ARVC present detect 24-hour monitor perform annual basis ( St. Jude Confirm implantable loop recorder ) . These patient enrol 10 adult pediatric center across Canada , follow 3 year heart monitor implant . If heart racing detect , patient discuss result doctor discus mean .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy ( ARVC ) familial condition characterize onset life threaten ventricular arrhythmia early adulthood , present ventricular tachycardia , cardiac arrest sudden death . The disease diagnose test focus image right ventricle assess ambient arrhythmia abnormal electrical substrate . These factor collate score form ARVC Task Force Criteria , know specific sensitive . These criterion revise 2010 , introduce broader quantitative approach diagnosis include genetic testing result , intend enhance sensitivity without reduce specificity . They account finding genetic testing , confound part unknown significance positive genetic test absence phenotype disease variable penetrance expressivity . Genetic test identifies underlie mutation ≈60 % clearly affected patient . Recent access genetic testing demonstrate family member affect individual often harbor culprit mutation , little evidence affect clinical testing . Given risk life threaten arrhythmia first presentation disease expression , enhance detection ventricular arrhythmia would help identify patient manifest ARVC . The PREPARE study test hypothesis prolong monitoring implantable loop recorder ( ILR ) provide evidence progressive electrical disease gene positive ARVC patient non-diagnostic phenotype ( negative mild ) receive implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) . Detection non-sustained ventricular tachycardia incremental value routine periodic clinical follow-up standard short term monitoring ( 24-48 hour Holter ) . 100 gene positive patient without manifest ARVC standard screen clinical test undergo ILR implantation . These patient fail meet 2010 revise Task Force Criteria definite ARVC consider candidate primary prevention ICD local investigator . A Health Canada approve St. Jude Medical ConfirmTM loop recorder implant use standard technique local anesthetic , patient follow 3 year . Patients undergo repeat clinical phenotype test accord local institution standard practice , include test 3 year enrollment reassess Task Force Criteria ( standard care ) , constitute end study . A 24-hour Holter monitor encourage annually provide standard surveillance ventricular arrhythmia comparator loop recorder finding . In event non-sustained sustain ventricular tachycardia detect loop recorder ( ≥8 beat ) and/or Holter monitor , clinical assessment local investigator take place review trace discuss finding patient . This follow routine clinical care . The primary end point detection ≥8 beat wide QRS complex tachycardia consider ventricular tachycardia ILR . Secondary endpoint include comparison ventricular arrhythmia burden routine surveillance Holter monitoring ILR , change 2010 Task Force Criteria Score enrollment 3-year follow-up . Patients provide write informed consent participate study , data collect password-protected web base database . Patients undergo follow-up 1 4 week implant , 3 6 month every 6 month thereafter . Follow-up capture finding loop recorder interrogation , along change clinical status cardioactive drug use . A 24 Hour Holter monitor encourage annually provide standard surveillance ventricular arrhythmia comparator loop recorder finding . This pilot study explore prevalence incidence ambient asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmia presymptomatic genotype carrier ARVC . An empiric number 100 subject choose base disease prevalence recruitment goal . End point adjudication include 3 member adjudication committee comprise coinvestigators . A single interim analysis end point perform independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee 50 patient complete least one year follow-up .</detailed_description>
