	<detailed_description>Background : Early post-transplant kidney function attribute inherent donor characteristic , damage storage , perioperative event recipient factor . The incidence severe injury transplant kidney 10-25 % early post-transplant period . In addition , milder form early transplant kidney injury impact long term allograft function . Severe transplant kidney injury immediate post-transplant period hypothesize associated high rate rejection . Hypothesis : In current investigation , would like test hypothesis 1 ) mRNA microRNA expression proinflammatory gene donor tissue risk factor development early kidney transplant dysfunction 2 ) early inflammatory mRNA microRNA expression allograft associate subsequent activation cell mediate immunity evidence increased incidence acute rejection episode increase expression cell mediate immunity gene first year post-transplant . Aims : Aim 1 : Test association proinflammatory mRNA microRNA expression donor sample subsequent development early organ dysfunction immediate period follow transplantation . Aim 2 : Test association mRNA microRNA expression proinflammatory mediator transplant organ immediate pre post-reperfusion period subsequent incidence acute rejection expression gene involve cell mediate immunity .</detailed_description>
