	<brief_summary>A prospective , three-center , phase I safety tolerability dose escalation study , evaluate 28 subject 4 discrete dose cohort acute intracoronary injected collagenase range 300 - 1200 µg prior routine standard-of-care percutaneous revascularization procedure subject chronic total coronary artery occlusion ( CTOs ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enrolment expect occur 24 month total study duration approximately 30 month . Five ( 5 ) subject enrol dose cohort . The dose cohort study sequential fashion , start low dos escalate high dos . It anticipate subject 's involvement study 3.5 month . In addition , eight ( 8 ) subject include high dose cohort collect pharmacokinetic plasma sample . Subject enrollment dose within dose cohort stag next subsequent subject dose previous subject successfully discharge hospital angioplasty attempt . At minimum 3 day subject dosing ensure product safety . There advancement high dose cohort 5 subject discharge hospital safety review conduct Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) cardiac safety measure treatment deem safe proceed next dosing level . A total 28 male / female subject suffer CAD CTO enrol study three site ( Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre St. Michael 's Hospital , Toronto , Ontario , Laval Hospital Research Centre , Quebec City , Quebec , Canada ) . All subject one previous fail angioplasty attempt ( ) occlude artery . Subjects sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) meeting inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion Visit 1 ( Screening ) include study . All potentially enrollable subject Sunnybrook review either two cardiologist involve study discus available option subject approve enrollment decision . Eligible subject agree participate treat two part procedure . On Day0 use standard angioplasty technique access specify occlude coronary artery , Collagenase ( MZ-004 ) directly inject occluded artery microcatheter position immediately adjacent proximal cap occlusion . The catheter arterial sheath remove subject monitor overnight ward . The following day ( Day1 ) , subject bring back catheterization laboratory undergo angioplasty use standard angioplasty technique . Routine post-procedural management follow . The subject discharge Day2 absence cardiac complication ( elevated cardiac enzyme large pericardial effusion judge Investigator determine echocardiography ) . Prior angioplasty procedure Day1 Day2 prior discharge , subject undergo echocardiogram determine presence severity pericardial effusion . A moderate large pericardial effusion sign tamponade Day1 contraindication perform procedure , subject terminate study . A telephone follow-up perform 30 day post Day1 subject sign ICF enrol study . At 3 month , subject undergo outpatient coronary Computer Tomography ( CT ) angiogram ensure delayed effect treat vessel ( e.g . aneurysm formation ) , myocardium pericardium . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability acute intracoronary dos collagenase ( MZ-004 ) symptomatic subject coronary CTO . The secondary objective obtain preliminary efficacy information guidewire cross increase dos intracoronary collagenase subject previously fail least one previous attempt coronary CTO .</detailed_description>

( This prevent infusate divert side branch prevent ischemia prolong period time infusion ) Renal dysfunction ( creatinine great 2 x ULN ) Severe calcification ( collagenase degrade calcium ) base consensus 2 interventional cardiologist review coronary angiogram . Subject medical condition , judgment Investigator and/or designee make subject poor candidate investigational procedure Subject pregnant lactate female ( woman childbearing potential must negative serum betaHCG within 24 hour prior inclusion ) Subject partake another investigational product clinical study within 30 day Screening/Day0 Subjects bleed abnormality ( e.g . Factor VIII deficiency ) /or subject experience medically document active site bleeding within 30 day screen visit , , limit , gastrointestinal genitourinary tract intercerebral hemorrhage . Subjects recent acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) ( &lt; 4 week ) . For patient ACS ≥ 4weeks ago , nonculprit vessel recent ACS consider eligible study inclusion exclusion criterion meet .</criteria>
