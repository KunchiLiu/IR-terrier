	<brief_summary>Addison 's disease rare disease , wherein adrenal produce sufficient steroid hormone ( cortisol aldosterone ) . Patients Addison 's disease report impair subjective health status , increase all-cause mortality . Conventional therapy oral replacement glucocorticoid mineralocorticoid hormone , strategy imperfectly mimic diurnal cortisol variation , render patient over- under-treated . Anecdotally , patient adrenal insufficiency may benefit use various nutritional compound . We hypothesise liquorice grapefruit alter metabolism absorption cortisone acetate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In present study , cortisone acetate absorption metabolism assess subject Addison 's disease three occasion . On first occasion , subject regular diet , avoid ingestion grapefruit liquorice . At end baseline assessment order nutritional compound ( liquorice-grapefruit juice grapefruit juice-liquorice ) investigate next two assessment randomise . On two next occasion , absorption metabolism cortisone acetate study study subject consume liquorice grapefruit juice . Between use grapefruit liquorice wash period least 3 week . For study liquorice effect , subject ingest 24-gram liquorice per day ( equivalent 150-mg glycyrrhizinic acid per day ) . For study grapefruit juice effect , subject drink 200-ml grapefruit juice three time day three day . They maintain regular medication usual diet . Time-series cortisol cortisone obtain serum saliva sample third day liquorice/grapefruit juice use . 24-hour urine also collect . Measurements cortisol metabolite serum saliva use calculate pharmacokinetical parameter . The measurement sample obtain use investigated nutritional compound compare baseline assessment subject . Metabolites 24-hour urine compare similarly investigate change urinary excretion , estimate activity enzymes involved metabolism cortisol ( 5alfa-reductase , 5beta-reductase , cytochrome P450 3A4 system , 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ) .</detailed_description>
