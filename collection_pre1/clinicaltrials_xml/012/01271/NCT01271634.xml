	<brief_summary>The pathophysiologic basis hemifacial spasm cross-transmission different branch facial nerve . The hypothesis cross-transmission mediate sympathetic nerve fiber surface offend artery . The abnormal potential offend vessel facial muscle detect hemifacial spasm patient , determine sympathetic nerve fiber take part circuit cross-transmission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observe Abnormal Potential From Offending Vessel Facial Muscles HFS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It 's hypothesize location facial nerve compress artery , ephaptic cross-transmission take place nude facial nerve fiber sympathetic nerve fiber arterial surface . Thus action potential could spread indirectly one facial nerve fiber several facial nerve fiber ( via `` bridge '' sympathetic fiber ) , directly sympathetic fiber facial nerve fiber . The investigator assume electrophysiological basis hemifacial spasm characteristic sign abnormal muscle response ( AMR ) . If abnormal potential offending artery facial muscle similar AMR record , hypothesis verify .</detailed_description>
