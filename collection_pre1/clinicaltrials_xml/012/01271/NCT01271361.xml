	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( primary PCI ) new thrombectomy device compare primary PCI without thrombectomy increase minimal flow area stenting treatment patient present ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) assess OFDI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention well establish treatment choice majority patient present acute ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . However primary PCI alone unable remove intracoronary thrombus often result distal embolisation , reflow turn lead impair myocardial perfusion . This result leave ventricular dysfunction subsequently increase mortality . The use thrombectomy device percutaneous coronary intervention set acute ST elevation myocardial infarction recently show improve epicardial , myocardial perfusion , angiographical TIMI flow , blush score , result less embolisation . Moreover thrombus aspiration rheolysis show decrease cardiac death repeat myocardial infarction . It estimate late stent malapposition common stenting course primary PCI compare elective PCI , may predispose stent thrombosis . Late malapposition may relate underdeployment stent time primary PCI , may due part thrombus behind stent , subsequently resolve lead stent malapposition . Removal thrombus stenting potentially could lead well stent expansion less late malapposition . On hand , impact thrombus acute chronic luminal dimension still unclear set primary PCI . After stenting , thrombus either I ) protrude lumen mesh metallic stent strut II ) crush vessel wall stent . Theoretically , protrude thrombus hinder intra-luminal flow immediately stenting , resorption crush thrombus vessel wall might result long term stent malaposition . Due limit ability conventional angiography intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) detect thrombus , aspect investigate . Optical coherence tomography recently show feasible provide valuable information set acute myocardial infarction . This image modality show even sensitive detect intraluminal mass ( i.e . thrombus ) offer unique possibility analysis coronary intervention acute myocardial infarction . TERUMO OFDI novel optical imaging device use scan laser light source centre wavelength around 1.3 μm sweeping range 100 nm . The echo-time delay amplitude light reflect tissue microstructure different depth determine process interference tissue sample fix reference mirror . Compared conventional OCT imaging device , OFDI high temporal frame rate ( 160 frames/sec ) , faster pullback speed maximally 40 mm/s . The safety performance device investigate First-in-man study enrol 19 patient IVUS OFDI perform . In study , OFDI associate device-related adverse event , good correlation IVUS measurement . We hypothesize TERUMO Eliminate® thrombectomy device reduce thrombus burden STEMI patient result less intraluminal material large flow area , measure OFDI . This clinically translate good restoration blood flow reduce damage myocardium . In addition , reduction thrombus burden would eventually result less stent malaposition 6 month . Given benefit reduce thrombus burden STEMI describe , study may important implication prove effectiveness thrombectomy device use image modality ass efficacy . To best assess benefit thrombus removal , randomize control study consider appropriate method .</detailed_description>
