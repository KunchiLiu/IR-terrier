	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate effect upper limb cardiovascular training fitness , energy cost walking , fatigue pain polio survivor . Polio survivor often difficulty access aerobic form exercise due limitation mobility , pain associate walk fatigue . This result become physically unfit place polio survivor risk secondary heath problem due inactivity . A large percentage polio survivor low limb involvement strong arm . The participant study exercise home use simple arm cycle 8 week . They attend assessment two occasion . All exercise prescribe Physiotherapist include measure ensure safety exercise home .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arm Cycling Improve Fitness Polio Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) recommendation state stable muscle group utilise exercise polio survivor patient severe atrophic polio recent weakness exercise , March Dimes ( 2001 ) recommend exercise muscle group new weakness experience . Floor treadmill walk low limb cycling may also aggravate pain low limb weakness alter low limb biomechanics . Training upper limb ergometer likely appropriate form exercise patient good , stable upper limb strength . One small , well design , trial upper limb ergometry 16 week result 19 % increase maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) 10 postpolio subject exercise 3 time per week ( Kriz et al 1992 ) . ACSM recommend use Schwinn Air-DyneTM four limb exerciser ; however expensive bulky piece equipment unlikely feasible ongoing use community dwell polio survivor . A small upper limb ergometer may cost effective , accessible option exercise community dwell polio survivor . A closely monitor carefully prescribe cardiovascular fitness programme may enable polio survivor , gain control symptom fatigue pain change lifestyle activity , increase fitness perhaps subsequently reduce energy cost walking .</detailed_description>
