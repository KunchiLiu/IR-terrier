	<brief_summary>Background : - Recent cancer treatment study show alter cancer patient 's white blood cell may help immune system fight cancer . In study , participant donate white blood cell procedure call leukapheresis , cell alter laboratory give back participant . After cell give , patient receive aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) help tumor fight cell stay alive long . For individual metastatic melanoma , piece melanoma protein may add collected white blood cell help immune system recognize attack cancer cell . - Researchers interested test new process cell fruit fly ( Drosophila ) use help melanoma proteins attach white blood cell . The fruit fly cell die shortly protein introduce white blood cell . Researchers also interested determine whether IL-2 treatment necessary new cancer treatment process . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness modify white blood cell ( Drosophila-generated CTL ) treatment metastatic melanoma respond standard treatment . - To determine whether IL-2 treatment improve effectiveness Drosophila-generated cytolytic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose metastatic melanoma respond previous IL-2 treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical examination medical history , tumor image study , heart lung function test . - Prior treatment , participant intravenous catheter insert chest administer study drug . - Participants leukapheresis provide white blood cell laboratory modification . - Seven day start treatment , participant admit hospital chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine . These drug suppress immune system improve effect treatment . - One four day last dose chemotherapy , participant receive modify cell . Participants group receive IL-2 begin receive treatment 24 hour cell infusion , every day 5 day . All participant receive filgrastim injection help body produce white blood cell . - Participants recover hospital 7 12 day cell infusion last dose IL-2 . Participants continue receive medication provide blood tumor sample test . - Participants regular followup visit assess effect treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Adoptive transfer study patient metastatic melanoma follow lymphodepletion result 50 % objective response rate 10-15 % rate complete response . - A novel method involve use insect cell line express native major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) molecule . - When stably transfected human MHC molecule appropriate adhesion costimulatory molecule , Drosophila cell line potently stimulate tumor-reactivity vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) . - The current propose transfer Drosophila-cell stimulate autologous cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8 ) plus PBL administer conjunction lymphodepleting preparative regimen , without low-dose aldesleukin would represent significantly novel approach adoptive immunotherapy . Objectives : - To determine whether infusion CD8+ autologous PBL sensitize vitro peptide pulse HLA-A2-expressing Drosophila cell ( CTL-05 ) administer combination lymphodepleting preparative regimen supportive systemic aldesleukin result clinical tumor regression human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group ( HLA-A2+ ) patient metastatic melanoma . - To determine safety regimen . - To investigate contribution low-dose systemic aldesleukin cell efficacy . Eligibility : Patients HLA-A*0201 positive 18 year age old must - metastatic melanoma measurable disease - previously treat aldesleukin melanoma ; - normal basic laboratory value . Patients may : - concurrent major medical illness ; - form primary secondary immunodeficiency ; - requirement systemic steroid therapy Design : - The first 20 patient enrol ( cohort 0 ) receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen follow administration intravenous CTL-05 low-dose subcutaneous aldesleukin ( daily 5 day ) . - If 3 20 patient respond , subsequent patient randomize two cohort . Patients cohort 1 receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen follow administration CTL-05 low-dose subcutaneous aldesleukin ( daily 5 day ) . Patients Cohort 2 receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen follow administration CTL-05 NO subsequent aldesleukin . - A complete evaluation conduct 8 week ( plus minus 2 week ) initiation chemotherapy . The trial conduct use small Simon MinMax Phase II design initial phase Simon optimal design second phase . A maximum 35 patient may accrue cohort 1 2 . If response see first 13 patient receive systemic aldesleukin , accrual cohort cease . Total enrollment may 90 patient .</detailed_description>
