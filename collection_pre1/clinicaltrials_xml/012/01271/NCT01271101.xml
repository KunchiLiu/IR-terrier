	<brief_title>The Efficacy Safety Anticoagulation Chinese Patients With Non-ST Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-ST-elevated acute coronary syndrome ( NSTE-ACS ) lead cause emergency medical care USA . In China , syndromes also become major cause morbidity mortality account several thousand death hospitalization annually . Anti-platelet drug , anticoagulant intervention therapy high-risk NSTE-ACS patient may increase bleed event reduce ischemic coronary event . There evidence support association hemorrhagic complication short- long-term mortality . Therefore , future advance antithrombotic therapy NSTE-ACS need focus reduce ischemic event rate without increase hemorrhagic complication rate . In general framework , need appropriate adoption available evidence concern therapeutic strategy , specifically use different antithrombotic strategy , real world patient order improve outcomes.The primary objective study describe clinical epidemiology Chinese patient NSTE-ACS , evaluate current management China . This study observational survey , thus zero interference emphasize throughout . No randomization , blind special treatment assigned subject . Issues concern care subject completely leave discretion investigator order collect real-world information pharmacological treatment NSTE-ACS patient china .</detailed_description>
