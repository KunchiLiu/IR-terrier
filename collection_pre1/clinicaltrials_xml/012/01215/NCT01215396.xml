	<brief_summary>A number study show ingestion crystalline amino acid , particular branch chain amino acid ( BCAA ) affect endurance performance , marker muscle damage , possibly mental focus . It seem long low intensity event affect consumption BCAA . This study test hypothesis BCAA availability limit central fatigue ( feel tiredness ) . While various aspect performance test study date test multiple exercise , muscular , mental performance aspect single study . Thus , overall purpose study determine whether amino acid supplement change mental physical response prolong exercise versus placebo ( carbohydrate drink ) . This nutritional supplement could useful two level . Improved mental focus endurance performance decrease central fatigue muscle soreness could valuable enhance athlete performance . Similarly , decreased central fatigue muscle soreness may increase willingness general public exercise could translate decreased health risk increase health benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Purpose Hypotheses In current proposal outline study examine comprehensive battery test assess efficacy Amino Vital 's Amino Acid ( AA ) formulation improve physical mental performance exercise . We hypothesize : 1 . Ingestion Amino Acid ( AA ) formula improve cognitive , motor , physical performance post-exercise task hierarchical manner : 2AA &gt; AA &gt; placebo 2 . Blood concentration amino acid higher AA trial hierarchical manner : 2AA &gt; AA &gt; placebo 3 . Markers muscle damage low placebo hierarchical manner : placebo &gt; AA &gt; 2AA Recruitment Methods Process Recruitment method passive . Participants make aware study use Hamilton Health Science/Faculty Health Sciences Research Ethics Board ( HHS/FHS REB ) approve posted flyer McMaster University voluntarily initiate contact study team . A recruitment poster also submit post McMaster Daily News webpage . Research Design Methodology This study use double-blind repeated measure study design subject complete 7 session . The session consist familiarization completion three trial ( placebo , AA , 2AA AminoVital 's formulation ) . Trials complete randomized , counterbalance blocked fashion 12 subject , 2 participant complete trial order : ABC , ACB , BCA , BAC , CAB , CBA . In first session , participant screen use standard health questionnaire . Interested participant sign consent form . They undergo test maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) use treadmill . Subjects also familiarize physical mental performance test : Stroop test , profile mood state ( POMS ) , isometric strength test isokinetic muscle fatigue test . Following initial session , participant complete 3 trial ( placebo , AA 2AA drink formula ) random order . On first day trial , participant arrive lab morning day dietary control standardize breakfast include treatment beverage . Prior begin exercise , participant complete physical mental performance test . A small catheter ( flexible plastic tube ) insert forearm vein Dr. Phillips medically train qualified member laboratory group ; Dr. Tarnopolsky responsible individual insert venous catheter . The needle remove promptly insertion catheter ; catheter remain arms end trial . The catheter use repeat blood sample next six hour ( see Figure 1 ) . Additionally , breath sample take time blood sample . Following performance test , prior start exercise , baseline blood sample drawn . Participants perform bout endurance exercise consist treadmill walk 180 minute 40 % peak VO2 . Following start exercise , participant consume treatment beverage ( placebo ) every 20 minute start exercise continue 20 minute exercise ( see Figure 1 ) . Following exercise bout , participant repeat physical mental performance test . On second day trial , participant arrive consume standard breakfast include treatment beverage . They complete physical mental performance test one blood sample ( 4 mL ) take . The trial day breakfast consist energy estimate subject base Harris-Benedict equation activity factor 30 % . The diet 55:30:15 term percent energy carbohydrate : fat : protein . Subjects consume diet day prior exercise trial control pre-study calorie carbohydrate/fat intake , could affect substrate oxidation . Subjects refrain consumption alcohol caffeine day trial . Trials take place least 5d ( 10d ) apart commence time ~6-10am proceed accord schematic timeline show figure 1 . The testing time subject remain consistent throughout study . We also believe prudent subject consume fix constant volume water ( 500 ml breakfast ) trial prevent dehydration allow subject complete exercise safe manner . Data Analyses/Statistics All data analyze use repeated measure two-way analysis variance time within factor dose factor . Significant ANOVA effect scrutinize use Tukey 's test post-hoc procedure . Where significant correlation one variable another exists , analysis covariance may also perform . Significance accept P &lt; 0.05 . Instrumentation Sample analysis carry use microplate reader/ELISA creatine kinase ( CK ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) myoglobin , glucose lactate auto-analyzers , High Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ) amino acid well metabolic cart gas analyzer analyze breath sample .</detailed_description>
