	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common non-cutaneous malignancy men 2nd lead cause death cancer men . Radical prostatectomy one treatment option available organ-confined disease . Over 100,000 radical prostatectomy case ( total removal cancerous prostate surgery ) perform United States yearly . Unfortunately nearly men undergo surgery report diminish Quality Life ( QOL ) score due part due postoperative incontinence may require use multiple urinary pad per day . Many men also report debilitate irritative voiding symptom urinary urgency frequency , overall decrease urinary satisfaction score .

By treat bladder muscle instability , expect improve postoperative continence improve quality life patient undergo surgery total removal cancerous prostate . This pilot study assess statistical requirement number subject need fully 'powered ' randomize prospective study fully evaluate whether medication solifenacin significantly improve patient ' quality urinary life improve postoperative urinary incontinence surgery . *This study modify original protocol clinicaltrials.gov ID : NCT00581061 .</brief_summary>
