	<brief_summary>The purpose study study MRD status VELCADE base induction therapy ( VELCADE , lenalidomide , dexamethasone VELCADE , liposomal doxorubicin , dexamethasone ) patient previously untreated multiple myeloma study impact HDC ASCT MRD status post‐transplant . Our hypothesis MRD‐status continue increase significantly 3 month post‐transplant validate HDC ASCT need perform even patient achieve major response induction therapy novel agent .</brief_summary>
