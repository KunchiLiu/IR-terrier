	<detailed_description>Osmotic therapy mainstay treatment intracranial hypertension traumatic brain injury . Despite sparse concrete evidence beneficial effect patient outcome , widely accept treat physician osmotic therapy effective , least help control elevate intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , control ICP show improve outcome . Mannitol commonly utilize agent . It widely available , effective , low side-effect profile . Large dos long term period show safe , usefulness limited elevation serum osmolarity potential alteration renal function , efficacy seem diminish repeat dos . Rebound intracranial hypertension report discontinuation large dos . Other hypertonic agent urea glycerol longer use . More recently , hypertonic saline ( HTS ) solution various concentration become available , show several animal research study small human trial safe effective management intracranial hypertension . HTS cross blood-brain barrier , ability improve intravascular volume without osmotic diuresis effect mannitol . Several institution routinely use HTS solution management traumatic brain injury , use mannitol HTS common . Additionally longer-term use HTS restrict plasma osmolarity . There several small trial compare two agent , study relatively poorly control therefore reach limited conclusion . At institution agent ( form 20 % mannitol 3 % sodium chloride ) use routinely , particular rationale one . There suggestion one agent may better , explicitly test human . It hypothesis HTS mannitol adequately treat intracranial hypertension , HTS may additional benefit allow frequent and/or longer-term dosing , volume expansion without osmotic diuresis ( thereby improve patient 's overall fluid state , potentially decrease morbidity ) . We propose study patient acute traumatic brain injury require osmotic therapy control elevate ICP , compare use 20 % mannitol 3 % sodium chloride ( NaCl ) . Specific Aims : Primary Goal : Assess efficacy 20 % mannitol versus 3 % NaCl controlling elevate ICP acute traumatic brain injury Secondary Goals : Assess effect hemodynamic parameter ( mean arterial pressure , cerebral perfusion pressure , central venous pressure volume status ) Assess effect serum sodium osmolarity Assess effect patient outcome discharge</detailed_description>
