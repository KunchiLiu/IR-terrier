	<brief_summary>Patients metastatic cancer generally treat chemotherapy , improved median survival compare best supportive care . Despite , patient continue persistent disease sit initially involved cancer . Radiation therapy effective modality treat localized cancer generally use palliation symptom patient develop metastatic disease . Since patient often persistent disease chemotherapy , goal trial use increase dos radiation therapy sit involve disease order determine safety efficacy hypofractionated radiation therapy . The purpose study establish maximum tolerated dose , dose-limiting toxicity , recommend phase 2 dose hypofractionated radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
