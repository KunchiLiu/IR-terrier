	<brief_title>Sensory Reeducation Peripheral Nerve Injuries Hand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Changes cerebral cortex begin soon peripheral nerve injury result overlap cortical area adjacent result absence stimuli area cortical representation injure nerve . Sensibility reeducation process reprogramming brain progressive learning propose feed somatosensory cortex alternative stimulus preserve cortical map hand facilitate sensory recovery . This study base hypothesis sensory reeducation start first day surgery training mirror promote great preservation cortical map original hand , good functional result . We also believe sensory reeducation perform early mirror enhance return sensibility , emphasize functional reorganization less alteration cortical map hand . Metodology : Will include patient 18 injury median and/or ulnar nerve first week surgery . Patients randomize early group use mirror classic group sensory reeducation . In evaluate Rosen score use motor , sensory pain/discomfort component . The assessment instrument use : Semmes Weinstein monofilaments , Jamar速 Pinch Gauge速 dynamometer , goniometry , shape texture identification ( STI ) , Sollerman test , Disabilities arm , shoulder hand questionnaire ( DASH ) , two point discriminator numeric pain scale .</detailed_description>
