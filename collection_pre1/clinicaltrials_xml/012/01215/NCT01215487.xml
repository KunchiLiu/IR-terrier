	<brief_summary>Imatinib ( IM ) first-line treatment patient newly diagnose CML chronic phase . The drug associate high rate cytogenetic response minimal toxicity approximately 80 % patient . In 20 % patient however , disease either initially unresponsive IM ( Imatinib ) , resistance develops within month , blast crisis occur early unexpectedly follow initial response . An increase body clinical evidence indicate single agent molecularly target therapy ( Gleevec/Imatinib ) cure patient CML , molecular remission rare . There currently clinically useful predictive test identify AT DIAGNOSIS patient destine IM failure . The author study recently demonstrate CML stem/progenitor cell biologically insensitive IM also genetically unstable rapidly generate IM-resistant mutant vitro vivo . The team recently discover CD34 stem/progenitor cell newly diagnose CML patient subsequently fail respond IM treatment show reduce response IM high frequency BCR-ABL mutation comparison 14 IM non-responders 11 IM-responders . If find validate large prospective cohort patient , predictive test could use rationally design treatment plan early addition alternative therapy ie : Dasatinib combination therapy patient accord individual risk profile . Hypothesis : The clinical response newly diagnose chronic phase CML patient IM predict certain biological property CD34 stem/progenitor cell variable among patient .</brief_summary>
