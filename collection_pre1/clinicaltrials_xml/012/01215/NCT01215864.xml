	<detailed_description>TCD Pharma develop TCD-717 , novel drug specific inhibitor enzyme choline kinase alpha ( ChoKα ) , involve synthesis phosphatidylcholine , constitute major phospholipid eukaryotic cell membrane describe potent oncogen overexpressed human cell . TCD-717 evaluate Phase I , open-label , single arm study perform multiple center . TCD-717 administer 4 hour infusion two separate day per 7-day period per 28-day cycle ( 8 administration per cycle ) . Eligible patient must confirm , metastatic recurrent/refractory solid tumor .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologicallyconfirmed solid tumor , metastatic recurrent refractory standard therapy disease conventional therapy reliably effective effective therapy available . 2 . Where possible , recommend paraffin block tumor tissue slide contain section tumor tissue available ( sample collect store appropriately potential evaluation choline kinase alpha expression tumor tissue end study ) . 3 . Patients must ≥ 18 year age . 4 . Patients must ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 2 estimate life expectancy ≥ 12 week . 5 . Patients must adequate clinical laboratory value ( i.e. , absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5x10^9/L , platelets ≥100x10^9/L , plasma creatinine &lt; = 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) institution calculate creatinine clearance ( use Cockroft Gault formula ) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 ; bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN ≤ 5 x ULN liver involvement . 6 . Patients may either measurable nonmeasurable disease define RECIST . 7 . Patients must give sign informed consent prior start study specific procedure . 8 . Female patient reproductive potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test . 9 . Patients reproductive potential partner must use least one form contraception approve Investigator prior study entry . 10 . Patients central nervous system metastasis may include stable without administration steroid . Patients unstable metastatic CNS disease exclude . 1 .

Patients receive concurrent anticancer therapy intend receive time study exclude . 2 . Patients receive extensive prior radiotherapy 30 % bone marrow reserve , prior bone marrow/stem cell transplantation time prior study . 3 . Patients concomitant condition could compromise objective study patient 's compliance . 4 . Patients significant cardiac disease include heart failure meet New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV definition , history myocardial infarction within six month study entry , uncontrolled dysrhythmias poorly control angina , uncontrolled hypertension elevate heart rate . 5 . Patients history serious ventricular arrhythmia ( VT VF ) , QTc &gt; =450 msec men 470 msec woman ( indicated ECG take pretreatment evaluation ) , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; =50 % MUGA Echocardiogram perform pretreatment evaluation . 6 .
