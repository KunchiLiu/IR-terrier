	<brief_summary>The correlation change serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) PSA velocity ( PSAV ) severity lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) poorly understood . Previous study usually focus treatment efficacy preventive role alpha blocker ( AB ) clinical progression benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) AB therapy real-life practice improve BPH/LUTS reduce risk overall clinical progression . We hypothesize change PSA PSA velocity would correlate LUTS severity group BPH prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since successful treatment alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist , AB report first 1975 , therapeutic efficacy widely accept AB medication consider first-line choice worldwide among pharmacologic option BPH-related LUTS . Previous study usually focus treatment efficacy preventive role AB clinical progression BPH AB therapy real-life practice improve BPH/LUTS reduce risk overall clinical progression . However , correlation change serum PSA PSAV severity LUTS poorly understood . Some study show follow-up data PSA study period , fail show significant change PSA group AB . In contrast , study demonstrate possibility PSA change presence LUTS early tell conclusively would relationship PSA value LUTS severity . Because PSA value consider important factor determine whether transrectal prostate biopsy perform , We hypothesize change PSA PSAV would correlate LUTS severity group BPH prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
