	<brief_summary>Postoperative complication , especially bacterial infection , relatively common cause increase morbidity mortality . Effective timely antimicrobial treatment important prognosis , delayed diagnosis treatment substantially increase mortality . The early diagnosis infection sepsis today base diagnostic test available year , like WBC count , SR CRP . These marker suffer several drawback ; sensitivity specificity infection sepsis good enough kinetics rather slow term increase decrease . A major disadvantage CRP surgery trauma marker generally increase several day , reach plateau typically day 2-4 follow event , therefore , case offer need guidance early treatment bacterial infection . More recently , biomarkers infection sepsis become available , appear acceptable diagnostic use . Procalcitonin ( PCT ) neutrophil CD64 promise new marker early detection infection . They pros con compare compare traditional marker , CRP WBC count . It general view research need marker accept part routine protocol diagnosis infection , especially relation postoperative complication . The aim present study investigate clinical utility procalcitonin ( PCT ) neutrophil CD64 marker infection inflammation : - evaluate possible detect early phase postoperative infection use test versus traditional marker CRP , SR WBC count ( differential ) . - differentiate systemic bacterial infection systemic inflammation due surgical trauma . The hypothesis PCT neutrophil CD64 sensitive specific analysis early detection infection abdominal surgery CRP ( widely use test inflammation infection ) , neutrophil CD64 specific PCT . Patients admit Department Gastroenterological Surgery , Akershus University Hospital elective abdominal surgery include study inform consent . Initially consecutive series 150 patient include , number may increase depend number observe infection course study . All patient monitor treated formal protocol relate clinical sign infection , abcess , peritonitis , pneumonia , sepsis septic shock . In addition analytical parameter routinely use today order discover infection ( CRP , WBC count etc ) , blood sample PCT neutrophil CD64 analyze surgery daily stay hospital . In case sign infection , locally systemic , frequency analyse PCT CD64 increase accord severity change clinical condition . The expression CD64 measure flow-cytometry PCT measure immunochemical method .</brief_summary>
