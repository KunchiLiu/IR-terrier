	<brief_title>Motor-related Cortical Potential Patients With Essential Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Essential tremor ( ET ) common disorder unknown etiology pathogenesis . Typically described postural tremor , ET often mark kinetic component suggest cerebellar involvement pathogenesis tremor . The assumption illustrate positron emission tomography functional magnetic resonance imaging study , reveal blood flow activity cerebellum increase ET patient compare normal control . In contrast cumulative body image evidence , physiological base link ET cerebellar functional alternation scarce . Studies tandem gait analysis reveal 25 % abnormality ET patient surface electromyographic study find delay second agonist burst rapid wrist movement suggest possible role cerebellar functional alternation generation ET . In addition , since tremor ET tend appear movement ignition postural maintenance , conceivable sort tremor might exert certain impact program preparation limb movement . Thus would appropriate adopt tool , concomitantly assess cerebellar function movement preparation , investigate patient ET . In proposal , record movement-related cortical potential ( MRCP ) ET patient . MRCP slow negative shift start 1-1.5 sec volitional movement . It consist least 3 subcomponents , Bereitschaftspotential , negative slope , motor potential . The generator crucial generation MRCP include cerebellum , motor motor association cortex . Thus MRCP seem appropriate tool ass patient ET , trivial cerebellar functional alternation could responsible tremor generation motor preparation might hamper concomitantly . In proposal , addition conventional MRCP recording , dipoles source different subcomponents MRCP also analyze brain electric source analysis ( BESA ) evaluate difference solution source strength underlie MRCP normal control patient ET .</detailed_description>
