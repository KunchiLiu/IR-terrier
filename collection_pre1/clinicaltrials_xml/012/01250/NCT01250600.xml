	<brief_summary>Although lot evidence guideline recommend patient cardiac rehabilitation , reality , actual rate cardiac patient enter cardiac rehabilitation program low , usually less one third . One main hindrance patient participate cardiac rehabilitation program insufficient number medical institution provide rehabilitation service . Patients usually perform exercise program medical professional monitor without go far . This spatial temporal difficulty lead low rate patient take cardiac rehabilitation program . The risk patient exercise high healthy adult . This project develop intelligent portable remote care system cardiopulmonary exercise provide instant ECG monitoring service integration front-end wireless ECG measuring device , expert system , back-end tele-care platform . Many patient inconvenient go large hospital regularly cardiac rehabilitation training . This project help exercise home twice rehabilitation training clinic month medical professional supervise remotely see much exercise . For reason project help break spatial temporal difficulty cardiac rehabilitation , cardiac rehabilitation help patient . Patients tele-care system exercise home , built-in heart rate cardiac rhythm warn function remind take break , even take medical treatment . More importantly , ECG signal almost immediately ( real time ) upload network chest pain unit hospital . The cardiology expert aware warn first moment . This important protection patient ' safety rehabilitation sport home . This randomize control trial recruit 80 patient myocardial infarction within 6 week , able attend hospital base cardiac rehabilitation program regularly . All patient undergo three-month home exercise program instruction provide physiatrists physiotherapist . Forty ( remote-care group ) use intelligent portable remote care system cardiopulmonary exercise monitor exercise intensity cardiac rhythm exercise . The 40 patient ( control group ) undertake exercise program home without use remote care system . The efficacy safety exercise program compare two group .</brief_summary>
