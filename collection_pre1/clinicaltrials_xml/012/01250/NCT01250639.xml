	<brief_title>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Collaborative Genetic Study Non-aboriginal Taiwanese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study cooperative project Academia Sinica ( AS ) , China Medical University Hospital ( CMUH ) Chiayi Christian Hospital ( CCH ) aim identify genetic component associate type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , significant population non-aboriginal Taiwanese . AS provide funding , design study protocol , coordinate project , include subject recruitment , collection phenotype information bio-specimen quality assurance . CMUH CCH study sit responsible subject screening recruitment , bio-specimen collection packaging well phenotypic information collection . The study objective carry collaborative association study T2DM non-aboriginal Taiwanese . A genome-wide case-control association study adopt . Approximately five thousand T2DM subject whose age equal twenty recruit study physician out-patient-department CMUH CCH . In addition , relatives T2DM subject positive family history , least three family member affect T2DM within five generation , recruit study nurse . An age- , sex- , ethnicity-matched control select randomly Cell Bank Genetic Database Non-Aboriginal Taiwanese . After obtain informed consent , medical history questionnaire family background complete subject . The subject invite health check-up include blood pressure , body weight , body height , waist circumference hip circumference , well ophthalmic check-up . A 15 ml blood drawn subject measurement Cholesterol , HDLc , LDLc , TG , Fasting Plasma Glucose , Insulin , HbA1c , CBC without differential count , Electrolytes ( Ca2+ , Na+ , K+ , Cl- ) , BUN , Creatinine , SGOT , SGPT , C-peptide , Uric Acid CRP , well DNA extraction . A urine sample collection also request subject evaluation urine protein , ketone body , glucose , micro albumine creatinine . This genome-wide association study aim investigate disease cause variants/genes T2DM diabetic subphenotypes well underlie mechanism T2DM pathogenesis . Hopefully , early diagnostic marker new therapy develop base genetic etiology toward personalized medicine future .</detailed_description>
