	<brief_title>Effects Canola Oil Blood Vessel Function Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given much evidence current dietary recommendation type amount fatty acid base heart disease , propose research contribute knowledge base dietary fat recommendation individual establish cardiovascular disease . Specifically , study establish whether canola oil positive effect blood vessel function individual peripheral arterial disease measure true clinical endpoint ankle-brachial index , walk distance , claudication , vascular function measure . Additionally , since reduce blood flow contributes cognitive impairment , study explore whether improvement blood vessel function also associate improvement cognitive function . Given large proportion population affect atherosclerosis various form cardiovascular disease , significant potential great consumption utilization canola oil beneficial effect blood vessel function indicator cardiovascular disease risk .</detailed_description>
