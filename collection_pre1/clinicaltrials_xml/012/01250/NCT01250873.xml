	<brief_summary>LY2216684 study adjunctive treatment MDD patient partial responder SSRIs . Sertraline medication widely use treat MDD know substrate CYP450s , include CYP2D6 , CYP2C19 CYP3A4 , modest inhibitor CYP2D6 . Based diversity hepatic metabolic clearance pathway LY2216684 elimination kidney , expect CYP2D6 inhibition sertraline result substantial change PK profile LY2216684 . LY2216684 known moderate inhibitor CYP2C19 unlikely coadministration sertraline LY2216684 result clinically meaningful change PK sertraline . This study conduct test hypothesis .</brief_summary>
