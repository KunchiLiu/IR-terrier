	<brief_title>Endothelial Cell Loss Induced Astigmatism After Wound-directed Wound-assisted IOL Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cataract surgery ( removal cloudy lens ) currently perform increasingly small incision . Bimanual surgery , two instrument use remove lens , perform two 1.4 mm incision . Typically , one incision enlarge 2.2 2.4 mm order IOL ( artificial lens ) insert eye . Surgeons insert lens place lens injector cartridge completely eye ( wound-directed insertion ) place tip inside incision ( wound-assisted insertion ) . While wound-assisted insertion perform slightly small incision ( 2.2 mm versus 2.4 mm wound-directed insertion ) , method insertion cause incision enlargement . There evidence wound-assisted insertion cause short-term pressure within eye go . Neither method consider inferior superior , primary investigator ( Dr. Kenneth Cohen ) routinely use method . No study directly compare wound-healing characteristic two method . We seek compare difference : 1 . Surgically-induced astigmatism ( change corneal curvature cataract surgery incision . 2 . Endothelial cell density loss . Endothelial cell line inside surface cornea , overall density decrease cataract surgery . 3 . Best-corrected vision surgery 4 . Sizes incision lens injection</detailed_description>
