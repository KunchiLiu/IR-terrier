	<detailed_description>An estimate 40 million people United States wear contact lens , approximately 38 million soft lens wearer 2 million rigid gas permeable lens wearer . The ocular surface show respond introduction foreign material upregulation proinflammatory mediator , lead increase inflammation . The corneal show foreign body immune response contact lenses . The purpose study utilize in-vivo confocal microscopy describe difference corneal epithelial immune status across three lens care regimens new contact lens wearer .</detailed_description>
