	<brief_summary>Annual incidence severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) vary 180 300 100.000 . Mortality severe sequela risk increase 8 fold TBI . Studies adults show ante-hypophyseal deficit 28 68 % patient TBI . The common deficit Growth Hormone Deficit ( GHD ) ; follow gonadotropic corticotropic ( AdrenoCorticoTropic Hormone ( ACTH ) ) insufficiency . Thyrotropic deficit ( Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) ) less frequent . From pathophysiological point view , lesional mechanism responsible hypopituitarisms would damage hypophyseal vessel hypothalamic-pituitary vessel . The frequency pituitary deficit potential beneficial effect replacement therapy quality life , tiredness , loss energy productivity , justify systematic detection deficit patient moderate severe TBI . Study hypotheses : At present time , lack data child give u opportunity affirm one part symptoms showed child post-TBI neuropsychological sequela , link pituitary deficiency improve replacement therapy . Firstly , essential good understand natural history post-TBI pituitary deficiency , study connexion observe deficiency acute late phase sequela .</brief_summary>
