	<brief_title>Neurocognitive Changes Patients With Remitting Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Natalizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Impaired cognitive function may represent damage brain region involve physical function , hence may detect routine neurological assessment . Despite high prevalence cognitive impairment MS , cognitive function assess routinely clinical practice . The perception cognitive assessment costly , time-consuming , complicate , difficult administer interpret contribute , least part , failure incorporate cognitive test standard clinical evaluation patient MS. Cognitive impairment may also reduce ability patient comprehend adhere treatment concept ( Bobholz 2003 ) . Early detection cognitive impairment important initiate therapeutic intervention , even though optimal treatment cognitive decline MS moment controversial . Preliminary study suggest essential role disease modify therapy ( DMT ) inhibition cognitive deterioration patient MS ( Barak 2002 , Flechter 2007 ) . Data long term cognitive performance multiple sclerosis patient treat natalizumab limit . One study demonstrate MS patient treat natalizumab improvement SDMT ( Symbol Digit Modalities Test ) 16.4 % period 2 year ( Piehl 2010 ) . SDMT screen tool cognitive impairment MS patient , mainly measure work memory speed processing . As SDMT cover part neurocognitive impairment see MS patient , need study gain complete picture .</detailed_description>
