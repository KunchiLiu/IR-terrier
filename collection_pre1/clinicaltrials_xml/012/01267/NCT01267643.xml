	<brief_summary>Aplastic Anemia ( AA ) autoimmune hematologic stem cell disease mediate activated T-lymphocytes lead pancytopenia . The disease related morbidity mortality leave untreated approach 90 % . For 30 year , anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) combination cyclosporine ( CsA ) remain standard therapy . However , treatment response ATG best 50-60 % sizeable number partial response . Treatment ATG also associate significant toxicity high relapse rate high 45 % . Since prognosis refractory relapse AA remain poor , need less toxic novel immunosuppressive agent improve response rate remission duration refractory relapse AA . Alefacept human recombinant dimeric fusion protein compose terminal portion leukocyte function antigen-3 ( LFA3/CD58 ) Fc portion human IgG1 . It prevent co-stimulatory signal antigen present cell memory T cell competitive inhibition CD2 T cell , induces selective apoptosis CD4+ CD8+ memory effector T cell interaction Fc portion IgG1 FcyIII NK cell , possibly direct ligation CD2 molecules T cell subsequently result alteration T cell agonist signal . It use successfully treatment T cell mediate disorder particularly psoriasis steroid refractory graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) minimal side effect . In case liver transplant associate AA ( similar transfusion associate AA ) fatal patient , Alefacept induce remission patient respond ATG immunosuppressant . The investigator hypothesize LFA3-CD2 co-stimulatory pathway play important role immune pathogenesis AA treatment Alefacept help treat refractory/relapsed case AA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : 1 . Primary Objective - To define safety , tolerability , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , alefacept relapsed/ refractory aplastic anemia ( AA ) . - To evaluate efficacy alefacept refractory/ relapse AA determine overall response rate ( ORR ) include complete remission [ CR ] partial remission ( PR ) rate . 2 . Secondary Objective - To evaluate predictive marker response Alefacept relapsed/ refractory AA evaluate effect PNH clone . The effect alefacept major population lymphocytes evaluate . The absolute number various T cell population include CD3+ T cell , CD3+/CD4+ T cell , CD3+/CD8+ , CD57+ natural killer cell count CD4/CD8 ratio measure part immunodeficiency panel flow cytometry . The functional property T cell evaluate measure marker T cell activation cytokine production . The saturation CD2 receptor alefacept determine . Occupied CD2 detectable compete antibody in-vitro . The expression CD2 within lymphocyte measure prior initiation therapy every 2 week prior 30 minute administration alefacept . The presence Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) clone patient AA show correlate increase response immunosuppression25 . OUTLINE : This open-label , single center study . Patients receive intravenous Alefacept weekly total 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 12 week treatment , patient go 12 week observation period . After completion study , patient follow periodically . The dose define Phase 1 study use subsequent Phase 2 study . Four bone marrow biopsy take screening , week 13 , week 24 , end study .</detailed_description>
