	<brief_summary>GSK2251052 member novel mechanistic structural class antibiotic inhibit bacterial enzyme leucyl tRNA synthetase ( LeuRS ) form boron adduct tRNA currently development treatment hospital acquire Gram-negative infection ( include E. coli , K. pneumoniae , Enterobacter spp. ) . This open-label , randomize , single period , parallel-cohort pharmacokinetic study evaluate serum pulmonary pharmacokinetics follow single dose multiple dose administration intravenous GSK2251052 . In Cohort 1 , approximately 15 healthy adult subject randomize receive single IV dose GSK2251052 1500 mg fast state . Following dose , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid serial plasma sample collect determination GSK2251052 parent metabolite concentration . In Cohort 2 , approximately 15 healthy adult subject receive GSK2251052 1500 mg IV BID x 5 dos ( Cohort 2 ) . Following last dose fast state , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid serial plasma sample collect determination GSK2251052 parent metabolite concentration . Vital sign , ECGs , adverse event monitor throughout study . A follow visit occur 10 14 day last dose study drug .</brief_summary>

A minimum list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates , cannabinoids , benzodiazepine . A positive test HIV antibody . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : An average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female . One drink equivalent 12 g alcohol : 12 ounce ( 360 ml ) beer , 5 ounce ( 150 ml ) wine 1.5 ounce ( 45 ml ) 80 proof distil spirit . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . History sensitivity pre postprocedure medication relate BAL procedure codeine , atropine , lidocaine , midazolam , fentanyl . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Pregnant female determine positive urine hCG test screen prior dosing . Lactating female .
