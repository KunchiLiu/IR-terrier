	<brief_title>Vismodegib Treating Patients With Advanced Chondrosarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate antitumor activity GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) term 6-month clinical benefit rate ( complete response , partial response , stable disease , per revise Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion 2009 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Best overall response ( per revise RECIST criterion 2009 ) . II . 1- 2-year progression-free survival . III . 1- 2-year overall survival . IV . GDC-0449 safety . V. Pharmacogenomics analysis predictive marker treatment outcome . OUTLINE : Patients receive vismodegib orally ( PO ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
