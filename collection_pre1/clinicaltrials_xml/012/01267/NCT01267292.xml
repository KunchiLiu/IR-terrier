	<brief_summary>Chronic cocaine use may produce disruption neurotransmitter function ( include dopamine ) . This may turn contribute measurable dysfunction important cognitive behavioral process . Stimulants enhance dopamine ( DA ) function may help treat cocaine dependence improve behavioral function -- support notion process relate . An important step understand subjective , physiological , behavioral effect potential medication cocaine dependence . DA-modulating drug may target pharmacotherapy substance dependence , particularly stimulant drug like cocaine , disrupt normal DA function . Buspirone currently available dopamine subtype 3 ( DA3 ) approve human administration , thus viable investigational compound . This project propose evaluate DA-modulating effect buspirone behavioral deficiency relate DA depletion . Accordingly , project aim characterize effect buspirone individual cocaine dependence . Employing daily dose design within acute stimulant challenge ( methylphenidate ) , experiment characterize subjective effect , cardiovascular effect , behavioral effect ( attentional bias drug cue risky decision making ) . The primary hypothesis buspirone attenuate increase subjective drug effect ( `` stimulate '' , `` like drug '' ) behavioral effect ( increase attentional bias risky decision making ) produce acute methylphenidate administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic cocaine use may produce disruption monoamine system ( include dopamine ) . This may turn contribute measurable dysfunction important cognitive behavioral process . Pharmacotherapy stimulant enhance dopamine ( DA ) function show efficacy treat cocaine dependence improve behavioral function -- support notion process relate . In development novel pharmacotherapies cocaine dependence , important step full characterization psychopharmacological property potential medication cocaine dependence , include subjective , physiological , behavioral effect . Selective medication may play key role modulation DA neurotransmission enhance DA receptor activation . The D3 receptor autoreceptor may function control phasic DA activity mediate sensitization DA agonist , thus play role conditioning drug abuse like cocaine . Growing evidence suggest D3 receptor antagonist may target pharmacotherapy substance dependence , particularly stimulant drug like cocaine , disrupt normal DA function . Importantly , administration D3 antagonist may disrupt reactivity ( attention ) drug cue attenuate cue-induced craving . Buspirone currently available D3 antagonist approve human administration , thus viable investigational compound . This project propose evaluate potential pharmacotherapeutic action D3 antagonist buspirone . The DA-modulating effect buspirone may help affective behavioral deficiency relate DA depletion . Accordingly , project aim characterize psychopharmacology buspirone individual cocaine dependence . Employing chronic dosing design within acute stimulant challenge ( methylphenidate ) , experiment conduct use well-established psychopharmacological method order characterize shape magnitude chronic pretreatment-mediated change methylphenidate dose-response curve . Measures include subjective effect , cardiovascular effect , behavioral effect ( attentional bias drug cue risky decision making ) . These data compliment provide valuable information clinical trial use agent treat cocaine dependence .</detailed_description>
