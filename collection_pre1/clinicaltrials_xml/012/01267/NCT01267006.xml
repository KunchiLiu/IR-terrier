	<detailed_description>The current study conduct two part . In Part A - Cohort 1 , healthy fed subject age 40 64 year ( inclusive ) enrol evaluate pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics twice daily oral administration GSK1325756 compare match placebo . In Part B - Cohort 2 , healthy elderly subject age 65 80 year ( inclusive ) enrol evaluate pharmacokinetic profile twice daily oral administration GSK1325756 administer fed fasted condition . Parts A B may perform parallel . The approximate duration current study expect 64 74 day . The study require subject complete screen visit within 30 day , follow Part A - Cohort 1 enrolment require 3 x ( 3 day treatment period + 7 day washout period ) Part B Cohort 2 enrolment require 2 x ( 3 day treatment period + 7 day washout period ) .
