	<brief_summary>This partially randomize phase II trial study give capecitabine vorinostat treat patient head neck cancer come back previous treatment spread area body . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether give capecitabine together vorinostat effective capecitabine alone treat patient cancer head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine Vorinostat Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate ( complete partial ) duration response combination vorinostat capecitabine patient recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) . ( SCCHN ) II . To determine objective response rate ( complete partial ) duration response combination vorinostat capecitabine patient recurrent and/or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) . ( NPC ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability combination vorinostat capecitabine patient recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN . ( SCCHN ) II . To determine rate progression-free survival ( PFS ) 6 month . ( SCCHN ) III . To determine rate duration stable disease ( SD ) . ( SCCHN ) IV . To determine median PFS , rate PFS 1 year . ( SCCHN ) V. To determine median overall survival ( OS ) , rate overall survival 6 month 1 year . ( SCCHN ) VI . To evaluate safety tolerability combination vorinostat capecitabine patient recurrent and/or metastatic NPC . ( NPC ) VII . To determine duration objective response . ( NPC ) VIII . To determine rate duration stable disease ( SD ) . ( NPC ) IX . To determine median PFS , rate PFS 1 year . ( NPC ) X . To determine median overall survival ( OS ) , rate overall survival 6 month 1 year . ( NPC ) OUTLINE : This non-randomized , open-label study patient SCCHN NPC ( Stage I ) , follow randomize study patient NPC ( Stage II ) . STAGE I : Patients receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) vorinostat PO daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . STAGE II : Patients NPC randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive capecitabine PO BID vorinostat PO daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive capecitabine PO BID day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3-4 week every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
