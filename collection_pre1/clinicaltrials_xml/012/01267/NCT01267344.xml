	<brief_summary>The primary objective investigate objective response rate patient receive GEMOX ( gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin ) plus cetuximab first line treatment advance metastatic unresectable BTC biliary tract cancer compare patient receive chemotherapy without cetuximab . The secondary objective include exploration effect multimodality strategy progression-free overall survival , biomarker prediction , toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It consider realistic , within 18 month 120 patient include participate center . Based previous publication objective response rate ( ORR ) 20 % expect GEMOX arm ( Arm B ) . When sample size evaluable patient 110 120 evaluable patient ( ie . 55 60 patient per treatment arm ) , two-sided 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) difference arm B response rate PB , 20 % arm A response rate PA 30 % , 35 % 40 % base large sample normal approximation width 15.4 % 16.7 % . We assume objective response rate 30 % Arm A , two-sided 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) difference arm B response rate PB , 20 % arm A response rate PA 30 % width ±15.4 % sample size evaluable patient 120 ( i.e. , 60 patient per treatment arm ) .</detailed_description>
