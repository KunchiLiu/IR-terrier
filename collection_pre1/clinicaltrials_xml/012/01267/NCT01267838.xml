	<detailed_description>1 . STUDY BACKGROUND : Currently , simple stepwise provisional T-stenting approach frequently use type treatment coronary bifurcation lesion . When stenting side branch main branch ( double stenting ) need dissection , TIMI flow &lt; 2 , high residual stenosis &gt; 75 % variety technique , propose . The common technique T-stenting Culotte-stenting . Adriaenssens et al ( 1 ) analyse data 132 patient treat Culotte-stenting include Quantitative Coronary Angiography ( QCA ) analysis clinical follow-up 1 year post Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) . The author demonstrate incidence binary angiographic restenosis 22 % whole bifurcation lesion . Procedural angiographic success achieve lesion ( final kissing balloon dilatation perform 62 % patient ) . At 12 month , 28 132 ( 21 % ) patient undergone target lesion revascularization . The incidence stent thrombosis ( 1 year ) low ( 1.5 % ) . Ferenc et al . ( 2 ) compare systematic T-stenting provisional T-stenting 202 patient BBK 1 study . There significant difference 2 strategy . Overall , maximum percent diameter stenosis bifurcation 31 % 9 month , correspond binary restenosis rate 11 % . Within 1-year follow-up , prompt target lesion reintervention 9,9 % patient . The risk late stent thrombosis low ( 2 % ) 2-year follow-up . The randomised multicenter Nordic 2 study address question whether Crush-stenting Culotte-stenting achieves well angiographic clinical outcome PCI bifurcation lesion ( Erglis et al ) . The result demonstrate superiority Culotte-stenting compare Crush-stenting . Major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) primary study endpoint occur 3.7 % Culotte study arm compare 4.3 Crush study arm ( p =0.87 ) . Likewise , double stent study arm BBC One study Crush-stenting use successfully ( Hildick-Smith , TCT Late Breaking Trials 2008 ) .

Coronary Angiography Intervention 5.4.1 . Angiography Using standard procedure angioplasty , introducer sheath least 6 French introduce heparin bolus administer . After introduction guide catheter follow intra-coronary injection nitroglycerin , baseline angiography vessel perform least two best view show target lesion free foreshorten vessel overlap , use 6 French large guide catheter . 5.4.2 . Lesion / Vessel Pre-treatment For patient multiple lesion require treatment time index procedure , lesion outside target vessel must treat first successfully . The target lesion main branch cross intracoronary guide wire 0.014 inch diameter second guide wire pass side branch protect access . The choice appropriate guide wire discretion operator . After successful passage guide wire lesion main branch pre-dilated appropriately sized balloon . Predilatation side branch stenting main branch discretion operator . 5.4.3 . Stenting Procedure Stenting Technique Among many approach bifurcation stenting , choose technique avoid non-stented gap orifice side branch minimal stent distortion stent overlap carina region proximal segment main branch . Both technique provisional T-stenting well Culotte-stenting provide complete coverage side branch ostium . Final 'kissing balloon ' dilatation perform patient irrespective whether assigned T-stenting Culotte-stenting . Stents select long enough cover lesion completely . If one stent need cover lesion main side branch completely , recommend overlap stent 1 - 2 mm . The aim reach diameter stenosis &lt; 10 % without proximal distal dissection . Post dilatation may perform operator discretion . Pre post dilatation technique avoid balloon injury segment vessel entirely cover drug elute stent include patient provisional side branch stenting follow unsatisfactory result balloon angioplasty . T-stenting : Both vessel wire . Lesion preparation main vessel side branch may undertake accord operator preference . After lesion preparation , main branch stented first . After placement stent main branch , rewire predilatation side branch , second stent side branch advance additional balloon place main branch orifice side branch . Then , stent side branch position , take care marker band first half millimetre stent within main branch stent . When optimal position side-branch stent achieve , side-branch stent deployedby kiss balloon manoeuvre , first inflate side-branch balloon stent immediately afterwards main branch balloon . Culotte stent technique : Both vessel wire . Lesion preparation main vessel side branch may undertake accord operator preference . After lesion preparation , side branch stented first . The first stent place main branch side branch side branch , cover entire diseased segment wire jail main vessel . The main vessel rewire stent strut , removal jail wire , dilate balloon separate stent strut . The side branch wire remove ( prevent metal-to-metal jail ) main vessel stented cover proximal distal segment . The side-branch re-wired high pressure ( e.g . 20 atm ) individual inflation make vessel bifurcation point ensure good stent strut separation . Finally low pressure kiss inflation make . For high pressure individual low pressure final kissing inflation , balloon size accordance diameter vessel . Further treatment proximal distal aspect main vessel side branch continue discretion operator . At stage , proximal distal dissection may treat required stent implantation . At stage , post-dilatations may undertake optimise stent expansion . Irrespective assigned treatment , glyceryl trinitrate inject intra-coronarily completion procedure final angiography vessel perform two optimal view choose baseline . 5.4.4 . Stent type Any approve type drug-eluting stent use operator 's discretion . 5.5 .
