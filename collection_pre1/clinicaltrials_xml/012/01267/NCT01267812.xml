	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving bortezomib together rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bortezomib rituximab together work treat patient mantle cell lymphoma previously undergone stem cell transplantation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Rituximab Treating Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma Who Have Previously Undergone Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate two year disease free survival mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) patient treat bortezomib + rituximab hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity profile , safety , overall survival , time treatment failure , remission duration , biological marker mantle cell lymphoma patient treat bortezomib + rituximab autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . OUTLINE : Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously ( SC ) intravenously ( IV ) 3-5 second rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment bortezomib repeat every 3 month 8 course treatment rituximab repeat every 6 month 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
