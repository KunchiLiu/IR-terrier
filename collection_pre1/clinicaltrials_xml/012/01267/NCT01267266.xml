	<brief_title>Saracatinib Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine AZD0530 ( saracatinib ) increase time radiographic progression men CRPC compare placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe adverse event related AZD0530 population . II . Explore role FYN SRC kinase expression predictor response AZD0530 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . LEAD-IN PHASE : Patients receive oral saracatinib daily 8 week . Patients achieve disease regression PSA decrease &gt; 50 % continue receive open-label saracatinib . Patients show radiographic evidence new metastasis bone scan CT , disease regression , &gt; 50 % decrease PSA continue randomize phase . RANDOMIZED PHASE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral saracatinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive oral placebo daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Upon progression , patient may crossover arm I. Tissue sample may collect correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
