	<brief_title>Brivanib Alaninate Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient persistent recurrent cervical cancer , survive progression-free least 6 month proportion patient objective tumor response ( complete partial ) , treat brivanib ( brivanib alaninate ) . II . To determine nature degree toxicity brivanib cohort patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient persistent recurrent cervical cancer treat brivanib . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain serum expression level surrogate marker brivanib effect include angiogenic factor ( vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] basic fibroblast growth factor [ bFGF ] ) markers endothelial damage ( E-selectin , vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 [ VCAM-1 ] , ( intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ ICAM-1 ] ) . ( exploratory ) II . To determine whether marker expression level alone combination associate response , PFS , overall survival . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : Patients receive brivanib alaninate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
