	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Pharmacokinetics Absolute Bioavailability GSK962040 Given Oral Dose Simultaneously With Intravenous Microtracer Dose 14C-GSK962040 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK962040 selective non-peptide motilin receptor agonist develop treatment condition associate slow rate gastric emptying . The purpose study determine absolute bioavailability metabolic profile GSK962040 . Subjects administer single oral dose 50 mg follow single intravenous dose 10 mL contain 100 microgram ( 270 nCi , 10 kBq ) 14C GSK962040 , administer infusion 15 minute , begin 90 min administration oral dose ( approximate Cmax ) . The oral dose 50 mg well tolerate follow single oral administration predict therapeutic dose . There need characterize GSK962040 disposition anticipation drug use special population critically ill patient . The intravenous ( infuse ) microdose ( 100 microgram ) 500-fold low oral dose , therefore exposure GSK962040 originate infuse microdose consider negligible .</detailed_description>
