	<brief_summary>Epidemiological study suggest role low glycemic index ( GI ) diet management obesity associate metabolic risk include diabetes . However , evidence long-term , randomize control trial explore relationship low GI diet , weight reduction glycemia , particularly child adolescent , lack . Modern food-processing technology produce many food product high GI may contribute burgeon epidemic obesity worldwide . Since dietary habit shape early life , adolescence critical period educate young people acquire healthy eat habit prevent obesity . The investigator hypothesize , Chinese adolescent , low GI diet result great reduction body mass index body fat percentage , enhance insulin sensitivity favorable change cardiometabolic risk factor compare conventional diet 12 month intervention . This study randomize control trial low GI ( &lt; 55 ) versus conventional Chinese diet ( GI &gt; /=70 ) adolescent ( 12-month intervention follow 6-month observational period ) study ; 1 ) change body mass index obesity associate change cardiometabolic profile ; 2 ) underlying hormonal factor associate change .</brief_summary>
