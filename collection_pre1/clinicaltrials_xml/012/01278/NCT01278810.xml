	<brief_title>Phase I Study Novel Estrogen Receptor ( ER ) a36 Modifier Icaritin Advanced Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ERa36 predominantly localize plasma membrane cytoplasm mediate membrane-initiated `` nongenomic '' signal pathway . Membrane-initiated estrogen signal link rapid response estrogen generally activate signal pathway like MAPK/ERK , phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase , protein kinase C pathway . Preclinical study demonstrate ERa36 express tumor cell might drive force breast cancer cell proliferation . 40 % breast cancer tumor use consider ER negative also express ERa36 . In former study investigator find 40 % ERa66-positive breast cancer patient express high level ERa36 tumor , subset patient less likely benefit tamoxifen treatment compare ERa66-positive/ERa36-negative tumor . Icaritin newly discover small molecular compound high selective ERa36 modulators perhaps promise new drug treat advance breast cancer target nongenomic pathway . It show inhibit growth breast cancer cell vitro vivo . The investigator complete preclinical PK &amp; PD toxicity study animal move test FIM clinical trial .</detailed_description>
