	<brief_summary>Subjects study recently schedule percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) part normal , routine medical care . This procedure restore blood flow vessel heart . One complication occur PCI procedure blood clot narrowing artery area treat . This result decrease blood flow heart . To avoid complication , patient give antiplatelet `` blood-thinning '' drug aspirin clopidogrel part routine care procedure . For research study , investigator would like take blood sample subject 3 different time point take antiplatelet drug . The investigator study subject ' blood medical history help u understand drug respond individual certain patient population . Everyone respond little differently medication due many reason include genetic make-up . Genes pass parent determine physical appearance color hair eye . Differences gene may also help explain drug work people , others . By study subject ' blood , medical history , genetic make-up record subject ' blood responds course treatment , investigator hope learn body respond take drug . Additionally , investigator hope find good way predict respond effectively drug well way monitor drug work patient ' body time PCI procedure .</brief_summary>
