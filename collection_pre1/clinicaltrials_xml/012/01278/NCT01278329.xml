	<detailed_description>Objective : Auditory stimulation pregnancy find influence foetal behaviour potential carry forward neonatal period . This study evaluate effect ante-natal music exposure primigravida healthy mother behaviour term appropriate-for-date newborn assess use Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale ( BNBAS ) . Methods : This single centre , randomize , open-label control trial . Primigravida mother age 19-29 year , free chronic medical disease significant deafness , singleton pregnancy , gestation 20 week less randomized listen pre-recorded music cassette approximately 1 hour/day addition standard ante-natal care ( intervention arm ) standard care ( control arm ) . Peri-natal factor adverse effect neonatal behaviour deem protocol violation . Outcome measure include score 7 cluster BNBAS . Primary analysis per protocol . Results : One hundred 26 newborn music group 134 control group subject BNBAS assessment . The infant born mother expose music pregnancy perform significantly well 5 7 BNBAS cluster . The maximal beneficial effect see respect orientation ( ES 1.13 , 95 % CI 0.82-1.44 , p &lt; 0.0001 ) habituation ( ES 1.05 , 95 % CI 0.53-1.57 , p=0.0001 ) . Conclusion : Music exposure mother pregnancy significantly influence neonatal behaviour .</detailed_description>
