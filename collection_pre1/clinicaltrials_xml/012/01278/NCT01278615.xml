	<brief_title>Selumetinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate ( combined complete remission [ CR ] partial remission [ PR ] ) AZD6244 hyd-sulfate anti-MEK ( selumetinib ) therapy patient relapse refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability MEK inhibitor therapy . II . To determine progression-free survival , time treatment failure , duration response , overall survival AZD6244 hyd-sulfate therapy . III . To examine biomarkers down-regulation phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase ( pERK ) several relevant target substrate ( e.g. , monocarboxylate transporter-1 [ MCT-1 ] , Menkes disease-associated protein [ MNK ] , ELK , c-v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog [ c-MYC ] , hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha [ HIF-1a ] ) peripheral blood study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample tumor tissue collection baseline day 15 course 1 biomarker study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
