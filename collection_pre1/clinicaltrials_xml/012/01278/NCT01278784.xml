	<brief_summary>The `` dry eye syndrome '' DES highly prevalent ocular disease , particular elderly population . One mainstay therapy patient suffer DES use topically administer lubricant . However , despite many effort , `` ideal '' formulation yet find . Recently , Croma Pharma introduce chitosan-N-acetylcysteine eye drop , design treatment symptom related DES . Chemically , chitosan polycationic biopolymer favourable biological property high biocompatibility low toxicity . Additionally , new formulation comprise N-acetylcysteine , use ophthalmology mucolytic property several year . Based theoretical consideration , one hypothesize new chitosan derivative may show increased adhesion mucin ocular surface may therefore particularly beneficial reduce symptom associate DES . We recently show phase I trial single instillation chitosan-N-acetylcysteine eye drop well tolerate young healthy subject . However , due fact intraocular pressure measure one main safety variable , topical anesthesia necessary . Thus , data local ocular discomfort administration limit . This trial seek investigate whether single instillation chitosan-N-acetylcystein lead ocular discomfort burn stinging .</brief_summary>
