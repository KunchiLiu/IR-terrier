	<brief_summary>This Phase I/II open-label uncontrolled , prospective study assess clinical biological effect Deferasirox ( ICL 670 , ExjadeÂ® ) patient NASH increase iron storage / distribution iron liver function liver histology . NASH define clinically histologically elevate liver enzyme , sign hepatic steatosis ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging , impair liver function express functional breath test , significantly alter liver histology . Patients treat phase I phase II part either 12 48 week . Both study part different endpoint : phase I side effect profile evaluate phase II therapeutic response test . Accordingly , measure different . Approximately 10 patient phase I 50 patient phase II enrol accord sample size calculation . The design `` adaptive '' Two-stage design , allow minimize number patient include trial well introduce correction second stage .</brief_summary>
