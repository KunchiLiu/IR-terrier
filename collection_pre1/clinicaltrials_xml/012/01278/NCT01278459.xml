	<brief_title>Can Atorvastatin Improve Vascular Function Women With History Preeclampsia ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women history preeclampsia ( high blood pressure/protein urine pregnancy ) increase risk develop high blood pressure heart problem 10-15 year baby bear . At present know reduce risk . Lowering blood pressure blood lipid ( fat ) level common strategy primary prevention cardiovascular problem . However , woman history preeclampsia 5-10 year pregnancy , normal blood pressure reading , blood sugar cholesterol level . Atorvastatin , type `` statin '' , widely use lower lipid prevent cardiovascular disease . This drug beneficial action lipid-lowering , may also help prevent cardiovascular problem , include improve function line blood vessel . We know impairment blood vessel function evident woman year preeclamptic pregnancy may contribute risk woman preeclampsia go develop cardiovascular disease . We would like know give short course atorvastatin woman history preeclampsia improve blood vessel function . To , ex-preeclamptic woman invite take either atorvastatin placebo ( `` dummy '' ) tablet daily 4 week , tablet 4 week , `` crossover '' receive alternative tablet ( placebo atorvastatin ) daily 4 week . Blood vessel function would measure use specialised noninvasive scan take blood test begin end treatment period . The study jointly run Departments Cardiovascular Medicine Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology John Radcliffe Hospital , Oxford . We anticipate study provide valuable data support large clinical trial determine whether improve blood vessel function ultimately reduce risk develop early-onset cardiovascular disease preeclampsia .</detailed_description>
