	<brief_summary>Is thoracoscopic surgery well traditional open surgery lung cancer ? Video assist thoracoscopic surgery lung cancer ( VATS ) presume less traumatic traditional open surgery lung cancer never document randomized trial . Some surgeon hesitate use VATS technically demand , others question two method oncologically equal . Regardless , VATS implement routine method lung cancer surgery several place around world include Odense University Hospital . The investigator launch first randomize control trial world compare two surgical method investigate difference length hospitalization , postoperative pain , life quality within first year , health economical aspect . The investigator include patient stage I II lung cancer , randomize VATS open surgery design patient doctor general round ward blind discharge dress surgical wound identical , regardless surgical method . The surgeon influence clinical decision include time discharge , decide specialist surgeon . Pain evaluation perform 6 time daily use VAS-score , life quality evaluate continuously first 12 month use EQ5D EORTC QLQC-30 questionnaire , consumption analgetics group monitor via national prescription database . Parallel trial similar clinical study , also first kind world , launch patient lung cancer eligible VATS . They randomize two traditional open surgical method ( anterolateral posterolateral thoracotomy ) - also blind patient doctor round discharge hospital , endpoint similar two study . 250 patient ask participate study - far , 91 patient randomized patient accrual beginning soon Skejby University Hospital , Denmark collaboration surgeon department thoracic surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Open Surgery Lung Cancer : Pain , Quality Life Economy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Is minimally invasive surgery non small cell lung cancer well traditional open surgery ? Surgical resection remain best treatment non small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) , unfortunately many patient suffer major postoperative morbidity - pain frequent . It assume new minimally invasive surgical technique ( Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery - VATS ) reduce postoperative morbidity level 1 evidence available literature . This prompt u perform present ongoing study , first kind world . The investigator compare VATS traditional open surgery early stage lung cancer clinical randomize double blind trial . Our aim evaluate difference postoperative pain , life quality , health economical aspect . The result trial could influence future surgical decisionmaking internationally surgical treatment lung cancer . Likewise , patient large tumour lung , suitable minimally invasive surgery , different technique available . The widely use technique posterolateral thoracotomy anterolateral thoracotomy . So far randomized control trail show technique superior . This lead u also randomize anterolateral posterolateral thoracotomy ( muscle spar ) . The endpoint use . Pain follow lung surgery much discuss topic long time field thoracic surgery . Depending reference , 50 % patient develop chronic pain open lung surgery . Therefore , different surgical approach develop include anterior , lateral posterior thoracotomy without spar chest wall muscle . The intercostal nerve also concern trauma rib retractor believe cause acute chronic pain . Other concern amount divide tissue , extend rib displacement rib retractor , type analgesic , administration form analgesic , administration time analgesic generally accept pain lung cancer patient multifactorial . VATS introduce attempt reduce surgical trauma less tissue damage , avoidance rib retraction consequently intercostal nerve injury , never less several patient develop chronic pain lung surgery VATS . Information quality life health economical aspect follow surgery lung cancer scarce . No randomized control trial publish . Very little known lung cancer patient regain workability extent follow surgery . Likewise , know VATS costly open procedure , opponent say , increase expense hospitalization save earlier return work . Inclusion well way . Other center show interest participate project . Follow complete number patient , result begin mount , wait analyze . End point 1 . Postoperative pain evaluate use VAS-score need prescription analgetics 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 26 52 week surgery . 2 . Health related life quality workability -efficiency period , use three different questionnaire : two concern life quality ( EORTC-QLQC-30 EQ5D ) one concern workability ( WPAI ) . 3 . Health economical aspect application pension , visit general practitioner , readmitted hospital , number day away work due postoperative morbidity , etc . All gather different database manage `` Danmarks Statistik '' among `` Landspatientregistret ( LPR ) '' , `` Sygesikringsstatistikregistret '' , `` Lægemiddelstatistik-registret '' . 250 patient admit department cardiothoracic surgery , Odense University Hospital , elective surgery lung cancer include study . Design This research project three sub study : Two randomize control double blinded clinical trial , one registry study . One clinical trial randomize patient small peripheral lung cancer VATS ( Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery ) standard open anterolateral thoracotomy . The second clinical trial randomize anterolateral posterolateral open thoracotomy patient eligible VATS . The registry sub study monitor patient use analgetics first 12 month ( lægemiddelstatestik-registret ) , use health service , return work . All patient operate general anaesthesia double lumen tracheal tube epidural catheter . The epidural catheter remove chest tube remove , later postoperative day 4 . As standard patient give paracetamol NSAID standard dos , need opioids ( oxycontin/oxynorm ) add . All surgical technique perform routine operation . Three different surgical technique use . 1 . The VATS approach : one camera port three assistance port one enlarge 5 cm . rib retractor never use . 2 . Anterolateral thoracotomy : The incision make posterior axillary fold follow linea inframammary point papilla . 3 . Posterolateral thoracotomy . The incision make anterior axillary fold backwards towards inferior angle scapula , without divide dorsal latissimus muscle . In clinical trial postoperative pain evaluate visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Pain measure rest coughing . Measurements do preoperatively 6 time daily hospital stay . After discharge measurement record 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 26 , 52 week mail questionnaire . Both patient staff general round postoperatively blind . In operating room dressing place cover entire hemithorax whereby incision hidden . This do identically regardless surgical technique . This dressing leave place discharge . If change dress need , either project-nurse nurse another team assist . The surgical note keep seal envelope , always place patient chart open case emergency . The chart include information lobe resect , detail surgical access , information add patient discharge . The surgeon perform operation allow check patient , consult doctor round , allow influence decision-making regard pain relief discharge , postoperative period . Timeline This project combination ph.d-study residency/fellowship cardiothoracic surgery allow long inclusion period . The timeline divide three research period three clinical period . This research project already accept ph.d.-project University Southern Denmark , approve local ethical board .</detailed_description>
