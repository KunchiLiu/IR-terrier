	<brief_summary>Nasal polyp significant health problem prevalence 4 % . It increase patient asthma ( 7-15 % ) , Cystic fibrosis ( 39-56 % ) aspirin intolerance ( 36-96 % ) .The quality life ( QOL ) bad patient suffer hypertension , migraine , angina pectoris head &amp; neck cancer per previous study Videler WJM et al.QOL comparison chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.The reason develop others remain unknown despite disease present centuries.A definite relationship exist patient 'Sampter triad ' : Asthma , non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug sensitivity nasal polyp . But patient NSAID sensitivity nasal polyps vice verse . Etiology largely unknown despite disease present century . Although factor like wood stove exposure , smoking , allergic rhinitis , rhino sinusitis strongly implicate literature various study , data available ethmoidal polyps.The present study attempt study association important risk factor antrochoanal ( AC ) ethmoidal nasal polyp ( EP ) .One study find significantly small proportion population polyp smoker compare unselected population ( 15 % v/s 35 % ) . But confirmed study . Seven percent asthma patient nasal polyp non atopic asthma late onset asthma , polyp diagnose frequently ( 10-15 % ) .Eosinophil number significantly high nasal polyp tissue increase patient co-morbid asthma aspirin sensitivity . Nasal colonization increase amount find Staphylococcus aureus presence specific Immunoglobulin E direct S.aureus enterotoxins find . Rates colonization IgE presence nasal polyp tissue increase subject nasal polyp associate co-morbid asthma aspirin sensitivity . Nasal polyps frequently find run family , suggest hereditary share environmental factor . In study Rugina et al. , half 224 nasal polyp patient ( 52 % ) positive family history study Greisener et.al , report 14 % family history strongly suggest hereditary factor pathogenesis nasal polyp . Some study find environmental factor like smoke use wood stave primary source heating development nasal polyp . The study contrast . There presently need understand difference pathogenesis antrochoanal polyp ethmoidal nasal polyp clearly.There hardly concrete research perform note difference etiology pathogenesis . Hence study undertake extensively study etiology responsible note difference .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Factors Associated With Formation Nasal polyp-a Case Control Descriptive Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study involve two part . A case control study wherein association nasal polyps various risk factor like smoking , wood stove exposure , allergic rhinitis , non vegetarian diet intake , rhino sinusitis , deviate nasal septum , occupational dust exposure eosinophilia.This study individually antrochoanal ethmoidal nasal polyps.Again studied respect recurrent non recurrent polyp . A descriptive study focus nasal polyp occurrence respect age , sex , religion , socioeconomic status , urban rural preponderance , overcrowd , aspirin intolerance , family history etc . The result study calculate odds ratio chi square test whatever data available . Interpretation perform subsequently . Gene expression profile would perform study difference gene expression level AC EP respect risk factor morphological characteristics.Mutational analysis perform identify mutation select gene .</detailed_description>
