	<brief_title>Effect Bariatric Surgery Mechanisms Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) two great public health problem 21st century . Lifestyle change pharmacotherapy , mainstay treatment T2DM limit success . More intensive lifestyle weight management Look AHEAD trial report 8.6 % weight loss 1 year , Diabetes Prevention Program report 7 % weight loss 2 year , 58 % decrease risk develop T2DM . In contrast , observe 31 % weight loss together 83 % remission T2DM severely obese patient Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) surgery . However , direct evidence glycemic benefit bariatric surgery randomize control trial lack ; clear consensus RYGB surgery good treatment option moderately obese T2DM patient ; mechanism responsible reverse T2DM surgery remain unclear may involve pancreatic insulin secretion skeletal muscle hepatic insulin resistance . The objective application evaluate effect RYGB surgery glycemic control underlie mechanism contribute T2DM obese subject ( BMI : 30-40 kg/m2 ) . Our central hypothesis RYGB surgery reduce hyperglycemia via reversal beta-cell dysfunction decrease hepatic peripheral insulin resistance . The approach require 12-month randomized control trial . The rationale base data show RYGB lower fast postprandial glucose , increase GLP-1 response meal . However , therapeutic efficacy RYGB surgery obesity-related T2DM need demonstrate randomized trial .</detailed_description>
