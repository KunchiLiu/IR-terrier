	<brief_summary>Coarctation aorta ( CoA ) congenital abnormality produce obstruction blood flow aorta . Coarctation occur isolation , association bicuspid aortic valve major cardiac malformation . CoA account 5-8 % 8/1000 ( 4-6/10,000 ) child bear congenital heart disease . Most CoA newly diagnose childhood ; &lt; 25 % recognize beyond 10 yr . CoA mostly repair childhood surgery balloon catheter dilation . Recurrence rate range 5-20 % . Recurrence often recognize adolescence . Balloon expandable stent become predominant therapy USA Europe CoA treatment age group . There FDA approve stent use . Biliary stent currently use label . Enrollment trial bare metal Cheatham Platinum ( CP ) Stents , design use CoA , complete . The Coarctation Aorta Stent Trial ( COAST ) aim confirm safety efficacy CP Stent native recurrent CoA . There CoA patient clinical situation place high risk aortic wall injury bare metal stenting . Extreme narrowing , genetic aortic wall weakness advance age example . Patients may present aortic wall injury ( aneurysm ) relate prior CoA repair . The occurrence surgical repair 3-4 % balloon dilation 10-20 % . Repair aneurysms surgically challenging . The use fabric-covered CP Stents prevent repair aortic wall injury become treatment choice Europe recently US FDA Compassionate Use process . There alternative device available US . COAST II test safety efficacy Covered CP Stents repair prevent aortic wall injury associate CoA . Funding Source-FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Covered CP Stents Prevention Treatment Aortic Wall Injury Associated With Coarctation Aorta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There prior trial prevent treat aortic injury associate CoA thus basis comparison . A single outcome assessment suffice since patient receive device either indication . A 3-category Severity Illness Scale ( SIS ) develop base clinical judgment panel pediatric cardiologist review Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) FDA Office Device Evaluation . Five level severity define 3 illness category , include : Upper extremity hypertension , Upper low extremity pressure difference , Severity aortic wall injury . The DSMB assign level illness SIS patient baseline one year follow . Improvement least one level indicate clinical importance . Safety evaluate identify adverse event compare occurrence surgical repair CoA similar age group report medical literature .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion use Covered CP Stent : Native recurrent aortic coarctation*associated ONE OR MORE following : 1 . Acute chronic aortic wall injury , 2 . Nearly atretic descend aorta 3 mm less diameter , 3 . Genetic Syndromes associate aortic wall weakening . Individuals genetic syndrome Marfan Syndrome , Turner 's Syndrome familial bicuspid aortic valve ascend aortic aneurysm , 4 . Advanced age . Men woman age 60 year old . The significance aortic obstruction leave judgment participate investigator . indication might include mild rest aortic obstruction associate : Exercise relate upper extremity hypertension ; Severe coarctation multiple and/or large arterial collateral ; Single ventricle physiology Left ventricular dysfunction Ascending aortic aneurysm + Aortic wall injury might include : Descending aortic aneurysm Descending aortic pseudoaneurysm Contained aortic wall rupture Noncontained rupture aortic wall 1 . Patient size small safe delivery device . The absolute low limit inclusion protocol 20 kg . However , serious femoral artery injury occur small patient , particularly 2030 kg range risk must review detail parent guardians child weight range . 2 . Planned deployment diameter le 10 mm great 22 mm 3 . Location require covered stent placement across carotid artery* 4 . Adults lack capacity consent 5 . Pregnancy cross cover subclavian artery acceptable certain situation , alternative treatment consider .</criteria>
