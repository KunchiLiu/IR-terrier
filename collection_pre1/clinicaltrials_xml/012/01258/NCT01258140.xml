	<brief_summary>Computed tomography pulmonary angiography ( CTPA ) image method choice rule acute pulmonary embolism base high sensitivity specificity . Unfortunately , CTPA use iodinate contrast medium provoke contrast induced nephropathy . On hand , Computed tomography use ionise radiation responsible half radiation exposure come medical source . Recent study prove low-dose CTPA protocol use Computed tomography tube energy 80 kVp reduce volume iodinate contrast medium provide increase vessel signal good image quality significantly reduce patient exposure . However , data sensitivity low-kVp protocol . The aim prospective randomize trial detect difference normal-dose low-dose CTPA protocol diagnostic accuracy detection acute pulmonary embolism ( PE ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection Pulmonary Embolism With Low-dose CT Pulmonary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) third common cause death U.S. , least 650,000 case occur annually . Its frequency similar Europe . With new generation multi-detector Computed tomography scanner possible depict pulmonary vascular tree single intravenous injection iodinate contrast medium ( CM ) one breath-hold . This non-invasive method delineate pulmonary artery third-fourth branch overall negative predictive value lie 99 % . Therefore , Computed tomography-angiography multi-detector scanner ( MDCTA ) nowadays prefer modality conventional angiography nuclear scintigraphic ventilation-perfusion ( V/Q ) scan lung exclude acute Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . Unfortunately , Computed tomography use ionise radiation already large contributor radiation dose population Western country . Most recent report suggest 1.5 2 % fatal cancer induce Computed tomography U.S , equal 25,420 case per year . Furthermore , rate young adult suspect Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) repeatedly examine Multidetector Computed Tomography Angiography ( MDCTA ) grow . Therefore , policy reduce patient exposure become important order reduce risk develop cancer patientsÂ´ later life . On hand , elderly patient , often impaired renal function diabetes , may develop contrast induced nephropathy application iodinate contrast medium , one common cause renal failure . Reducing iodine load patient group efficiently prevent nephropathy , save patient dialysis reduce medical cost . Computed tomography protocol use low x-ray tube potential capable lower radiation exposure simultaneous increase signal contrast vessel . Furthermore , high vessel signal make reduction inject iodinated contrast material possible . Thus , low-kVp pulmonary CTA warrant routine use young patient reduce radiation dose also elderly reduce risk contrast induce nephropathy . In 2007 reduced tube energy routine pulmonary Multidetector Computed Tomography Angiography ( MDCTA ) protocol 120 100 kVp significantly reduce radiation dose . Our experience 200 patient result simulation study show 80 kVp CTPA protocol use reduced radiation exposure 40 % reduced volume inject contrast material 25 % provide excellent image quality good delineation PE patient weigh 100 kg . However , clinical evidence base prospective trial impact low-dose CTPA detection PE . Therefore , large scale prospective randomise study compare 100 kVp 80 kVp protocol respect sensitivity specificity warrant . Objective Assessment diagnostic accuracy normal-dose low-dose CTPA detection pulmonary embolism show non-inferiority latter . Methods This monocentric , prospective randomise clinical study involve 500 patient suspect pulmonary embolism ( PE ) undergo CT pulmonary angiography . Examinations perform clinically indicate . All patient weigh less 100 kg indicate CT pulmonary angiography ( CTPA ) exclude pulmonary embolism ( PE ) September 2008 December 2012 regard possible study candidate . The patient , eligible , randomly examine use normal-dose ( 100 kVp , 100 mAs , 100 mL CM @ 4 mL/s ) low-dose ( 80 kVp , 150 mAs , 75 mL CM @ 3 mL/s ) CTPA protocol . Patients characteristic record . Studies analyze pulmonary embolism ( PE ) localization . Findings compare result sonography low extremity vein V/Q scan lung , indicate , clinical score ( revise Geneva Wells score ) PE relate death/ medical evidence pulmonary embolus ( PE ) 90 day follow CTPA .</detailed_description>
