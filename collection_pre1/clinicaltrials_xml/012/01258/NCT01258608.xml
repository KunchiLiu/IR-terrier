	<brief_summary>Mapatumumab fully human , agonist monoclonal antibody activate cell death pathway tumor cell specifically bind TRAIL-R1 high affinity . Sorafenib , multikinase inhibitor , standard care treatment patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The mechanisms sorafenib mapatumumab action suggest agent could interact synergistically . This Phase 2 , multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate efficacy safety mapatumumab combination sorafenib subject advance hepatocellular carcinoma .</brief_summary>
