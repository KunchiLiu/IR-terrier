	<brief_summary>Spinal surgery may associate substantial blood loss often require erythrocyte transfusion . Transfusion red blood cell ( RBC ) free adverse event associate increased risk infection , globally high morbidity mortality . Different technique use reduce perioperative blood loss related transfusion . Tranexamic acid use successfully cardiac hepatic surgery . However , study report use antifibrinolytic drug spinal surgery . This study design assess efficacy safety tranexamic acid spinal surgery reduction RBC transfusion . Hypothesis : infusion tranexamic acid spinal surgery reduce risk receive RBC transfusion , patient transfuse , reduce number blood product administer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Administration study drug The administration tranexamic acid/placebo start follow induction general anesthesia . A bolus dose give intravenously 30 minute follow continuous infusion administer 6 hour postoperatively . Drugs use anesthesia postoperative analgesia leave discretion attend anesthesiologist . The administration fluid ( crystalloids , colloid blood product ) record . Transfusion : The transfusion trigger &lt; 80 g/L surgery situation stable . Transfusion may initiate accord attend anesthesiologist situation unstable . In case massive bleeding , transfusion follow standard institutional protocol . The presence microvascular bleed surgical site assess surgeon . The Cellsaver use . The transfusion trigger postoperative period &lt; 80 g/L . Blood loss need transfusion record moment surgery 72 hour postoperatively . Laboratory test Before surgery : hemoglobin coagulogram value record . During surgery : patient 's coagulation status assess use thromboelastograph ( TEG ) . Thromboelastography simple coagulation test enable evaluation component hemostasis . TEG test perform induction anesthesia every 2 hour throughout surgery . An additional blood sample TEG analysis collect end surgery previous test perform hour end surgery . After surgery : laboratory test hemoglobin , coagulogram , fibrinogen d-dimer perform recovery room . Hemoglobin also measure postoperative day 1 , 2 3 . Blood sample assess cardiac troponin level collect postoperative day 1 2 . Ultrasound : Patients ultrasound examination inferior limb discharge hospital detect deep vein thrombosis . Follow-up The presence adverse event course hospital stay note . At 30 day , patient contact phone detect adverse event .</detailed_description>
