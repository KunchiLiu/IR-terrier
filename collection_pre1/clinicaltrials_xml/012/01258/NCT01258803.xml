	<brief_summary>A study compare bronchodilatory effect single dose Mometasone Furoate/Formoterol Fumarate ( MF/F ) pressurize meter dose inhaler ( MDI ) deliver without AeroChamber Plus® Flow-Vu® Anti-Static Valved Holding Chamber ( spacer ) versus Placebo MDI ( combine without spacer ) formoterol fumarate ( F ) dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) . Participants randomly assign 1 6 treatment sequence participant receive single dose 4 treatment period . Each treatment period separate 5 7 day washout period . It assume single dose MF/F MDI 100/10 microgram ( mcg ) deliver spacer would produce bronchodilation , define significant increase force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) area curve 0 12 hour ( AUC [ 0-12 hr ] ) compare placebo .</brief_summary>
