	<brief_summary>The Tryton Side Branch Stent System design address procedural difficulty surround treatment bifurcation lesion ensure patency side branch similar performance capability ( e.g. , track , radiopacity , coverage radial strength ) currently available conventional coronary stent design straight ( non bifurcation ) lesion . The Tryton Side Branch Stent intend treat maintain patency side branch/carina provide well ostial side branch conformability intend use conjunction currently approve balloon-expandable drug-eluding stent treatment main branch .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective , Single Blind , Rand Controlled Study Evaluate Safety &amp; Effectness Tryton Side Branch Stent Used With DES Treatmt de Novo Bifurcation Lesions MB &amp; SB Native Coronaries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use drug-eluding stent treatment bifurcation lesion suggest DES reduces rate restenosis int main branch ( 5-10 % ) ; however , result int side branch optimal . A study T stenting true bifurcation lesion show restenosis rate int main branch approximately 6 % use CYPHER stent . However , study demonstrate restenosis rate remain high int side branch ( 20 % ) despite stent implantation restenosis occur , generally locate ostium side branch . Further , half case PTCA alone intend strategy side branch , side branch stent place address sub-optimal procedural result . These finding consistent previous metal stent study suggest best long-term result obtain side branch stent place . This study others suggest outcomes related way stent sit within vessel ; therefore stent design specifically bifurcation lesion need reduce restenosis rate improve long-term outcome .</detailed_description>
