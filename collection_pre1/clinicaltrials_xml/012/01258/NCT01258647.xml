	<brief_summary>Two every three infant rural area Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) suffer stunt linear growth 12 month age . Stunting presumably result breast milk supplementation 6 month age complementary food ( CF ) provide inadequate protein micronutrient . Although supplementation select micronutrient may avoid certain deficiency state , CF animal source food may necessary avoid stunt . Meat readily available many Central African country . However caterpillar , locally available abundant , common staple adult diet may suitable substitute animal source protein CF . The investigator develop cereal make dried caterpillar nutrient content appear ideal CF . Maternal infant acceptability evaluate 20 mother 8 month old infant . The investigator hypothesize cereal accept mother infant : acceptability base priori definition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In preparation control study efficacy daily intake caterpillar cereal versus usual diet 6 18 month age reduce rate stunt linear growth , improvement health outcome , conduct acceptability trial . In trial , test mother ' acceptance caterpillar cereal willingness feed young child product . We also test infant ' acceptance capacity consume quantity require controlled trial necessary deliver desire quantity micronutrient . Study Design A cohort 20 mother-infant dyad recruit . The site recruitment area Health Center . Infants 8 10 month age major health problem . Infants minor , inter-current illness time recruitment might interfere oral intake exclude . After informed consent , maternal infant acceptability test use method describe . Maternal Acceptability Mothers provide 30 g portion caterpillar cereal instruct proper technique preparation . After preparation , mother ask evaluate five feature cereal . They also ask provide overall impression cereal . In category , evaluation assign numerical score use five-part Likert scale , `` like much '' `` dislike much '' . The evaluation conduct Community Coordinator ( CC ) provide instruction cereal preparation administer evaluative tool . Each evaluation conduct confidentially . Mothers aware response mother . At conclusion one-week period feeding ( see ) , questionnaire administer assess mother ' attitude willingness participate one-year study cereal feed . We intend evaluate attitude food preparation . The recommended preparation technique caterpillar cereal similar preparation enrich soy cereal ongoing complementary feeding study . This involve boil water cook cereal approximately three minute . Although preparation technique burdensome , compromise compliance ongoing study . Therefore , would expect similar response mother propose study . Infant Acceptability Following evaluation maternal acceptability , mother provide one-week supply caterpillar cereal ( 7 individual packet contain 30 g ) . She instruct begin daily feeding follow day , continue cereal packet use . The first feeding occur home visit CC , repeat preparation instruction , observe first feeding . The CC return home alternate day throughout week reinforce instruction regard preparation , make observation infant feed habit . Although frequent visit may influence likelihood maternal compliance hence may mislead investigator maternal acceptability , effect infant acceptability . Mothers instruct feed cereal household member , ask return uneaten cereal original packet collection CC end week . On 8th day , day follow completion use cereal , CC return home purpose data collection . The CC administer 24-hour dietary recall , collect cereal packet . In addition , mother ask question infant 's health status .</detailed_description>
