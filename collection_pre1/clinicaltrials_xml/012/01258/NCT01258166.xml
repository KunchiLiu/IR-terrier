	<brief_summary>Ulnar translocation carpus form wrist instability small bone wrist shift position . It well recognize patient rheumatoid arthritis , also occur traumatic event , violent football tackle fall height . The treatment option vary considerably , consensus best address injury pattern . Because traumatic ulnar translocation relatively rare , diagnosis may miss delayed , cause problem patient persistent pain loss function . The investigator present 11 case injury , discus recognize , report result different treatment method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ulnar translocation carpus form wrist instability entire carpus translates medially along inclined plane distal radius . This pattern instability well recognize patient rheumatoid arthritis result articular erosion attenuation wrist ligament . In contrast , ulnar translocation carpus follow trauma seemingly rare , publish account limited case report small case series . The radiographic feature traumatic ulnocarpal translocation describe instability pattern reproduce cadaveric model . However , recognition radiocarpal malalignment may unintentionally miss delay owe due uncommon nature injury . The investigator present 11 case posttraumatic ulnar translocation carpus review criterion early recognition injury result follow vary treatment method .</detailed_description>
