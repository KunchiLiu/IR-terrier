	<brief_title>Study Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Patients With Relapsed Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate ( ORR ) MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) patient relapsed/refractory lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess progression free survival ( PFS ) MK-2206 patient relapsed/refractory lymphoma . II . Assess safety tolerability MK-2206 monotherapy . III . Examine pretreatment phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( pAkt ) protein expression immunohistochemistry , correlate result treatment response . IV . Examine effect therapy serum cytokine chemokines regulate tumor-promoting inflammatory process and/or immunity patient relapsed/refractory lymphoma , correlate result treatment response . OUTLINE : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) weekly . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
