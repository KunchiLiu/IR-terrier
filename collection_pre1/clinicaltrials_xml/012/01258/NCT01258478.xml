	<brief_summary>Patients suffer non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , depend upon lung removal increase chance survival . But , type surgery advise patient significant heart disease , limited lung fuction reduce physical fitness . Intensive physical training show increase aerobic fitness healthy subject . The purpose study determine effect short term rehabilitation prior surgery post-operative physiological outcome patient undergo type surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For patient non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , lung resection surgery treatment option increase survival . However , surgery offer significant heart disease , limited lung function lack physical fitness . These major risk factor operative outcome . Cardio-pulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) allow direct measurement aerobic physical fitness maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2 max ) . A recent update professional guideline ( ERS/ESTS ) emphasize importance CPET preoperative risk stratification patient NSCLC . Interestingly , intensive physical training show increase aerobic fitness animal healthy subject whereas improvement VO2 max observe preliminary pilot study conduct patient undergo surgery NSCLC . However , net effect short-term , intensive , outpatient rehabilitation clinically relevant outcome , major post-operative cardio-pulmonary complication , well physiological outcome unknown . Objectives : 1 . To assess physiological effect 3 week intensive physical training patient eligible NSCLC surgery . 2 . To assess effect physical training post-operative outcome . 3 . To identify clinical variable , laboratory test specific gene polymorphism ( SNPs ) associate outcome .</detailed_description>
