	<brief_title>EARLYdrain - Outcome After Early Lumbar CSF-drainage Aneurysmal SAH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Patients suffer aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) predominantly threaten two distinct medical problem . Firstly , may experience second - often severe - hemorrhage , secondly , may suffer constringence reaction vessel supply brain blood , call vasospasm . The first problem resolve rapid cerebrovascular image subsequent treatment rupture aneurysm , thus prevent recurrent hemorrhage . Aneurysm treatment may perform either via craniotomy surgical clipping aneurysm endovascular technique occlude aneurysm small platinum coil . The vasospasm - second problem - difficult handle . A hypothesis development vasospasm related amount blood basal cistern . Therefore , possible strategy try remove blood much possible . Excess removal cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) via external ventricular drain fail prevent vasospasm may lead high incidence posthemorrhagic shunt dependency . Reason aneurysmal SAH , blood pack densely basal cistern therefore CSF , lightweight , drain ventricle . As alternative approach , application lumbar drain propose address clot blood basal cistern . Three retrospective study patient aneurysmal SAH , newest available abstract , able establish safety approach ( Klimo et al , Kwon et al , Tizi et al ( abstract DGNC 2009 ) ) . One fully publish study address vasospasm prophylaxis surgical clipping , perform patient endovascular coil . All study lead markedly diminish incidence angiographic vasospasm . Therefore , prospective study address efficacy novel therapeutic approach warrant . The focus EARLYDRAIN study examine efficacy application lumbar drainage patient acute subarachnoidal hemorrhage cerebral aneurysm . Hypothesis early application lumbar drainage aneurysmal SAH lead diminish incidence cerebral vasospasm , assess digital subtraction angiography , improve outcome , measure modify Rankin score , six month . 2 . Study outline Patients suffer aneurysmal SAH treat accord international standard . Aneurysm treatment discretion neurovascular team take care patient specify study protocol . All medical treatment perform accord local guideline standard operating procedure . Any patient meeting inclusion criterion violate exclusion criterion may participate EARLYDRAIN study randomize either receive lumbar drain , thus define two distinct group LD NoLD . To prevent premature rupture aneurysm due accidental drainage , randomization study eventual placement lumbar drain take place secure aneurysm prefer method choice . Any patient LD group receive lumbar drain anesthesia require aneurysm treatment . This performed anticoagulation anti-platelet therapy initiate , sometimes warrant endovascular coiling . A post-procedural CCT scan brain perform within 24 hour aneurysm treatment . In case neurological worsening procedure strongly recommend perform follow-up CCT scan soon possible . In patient LD group , CSF drainage start via LD slowly steadily rate approximately 5 ml per hour post-interventional CCT . This lead plan daily CSF drainage 120 ml per day via lumbar route . Patients group may receive additional CSF drainage via ventricular device require . The amount CSF drain via ventricular route accord clinical requirement specify . To facilitate accuracy drainage , regular drainage control every hour stop case excess drainage strongly recommend principal investigator . In case neurological decline suspiciously related lumbar drainage , drain close immediately may gradually restart 12 24 hour , perform CCT scan . If post-procedural CCT follow-up CCT scan show absent basal cistern sign threaten herniation , lumbar CSF diversion LD group shall perform . It may still feasible carefully drain CSF via lumbar route may ( Tuettenberg et al ) , discretion local investigator recommend . In patient require sedation mechanical ventilation , either due neurological impairment otherwise , intracranial pressure monitor mandatory . This may perform accord local policy either parenchymal ventricular device . If intracranial pressure exceed 20 mmHg , CSF drainage via lumbar route shall interrupt ICP 20 mmHg . Careful CSF drainage via lumbar route may still feasible case high intracranial pressure ( Tuettenberg et al ) , discretion local investigator . Further neuromonitoring TCD , EEG , brain tissue oxygenation , jugular bulb oxymetry , regional cerebral blood flow , microdialysis device discretion center accord local guideline . As far possible , data save electronically post-hoc analysis . A CCT scan well conventional digital subtraction angiography , CT angiography MR angiography assessment vasospasm large vessel routinely perform day 7 10 initial hemorrhage , regardless patient condition . In case clinical suspicion vasospasm , angiography may perform time . If perform earlier patient show clinical deterioration thereafter , angiography day 7 10 omit . After cerebrovascular image day 7 10 , day 8 case earlier angiography , lumbar drainage CSF stop LD group . It may pursue clinical base , require . Amount duration CSF drainage Patients randomized lumbar drainage group shall receive daily drainage 120 ml CSF , 5 ml per hour seven day . If high amount CSF need drain clinical ground patient hydrocephalus , preferably perform via external ventricular drain . The drain plan remain place control angiography day 7 10 initial hemorrhage . The local investigator may decide remove drain earlier patient fully mobilize without clinical necessity CSF drainage . However , consecutive drainage less four day achieve valid study result . Lumbar CSF drainage may prolong beyond control angiography clinical requirement . The amount CSF drainage may adjust clinical need bear restriction . Patients randomize control group receive lumbar drain plan control angiography perform day 7 10 SAH . If patient develops hydrocephalus , EVD place initially CSF drainage , lumbar drain may instal discretion local investigator . These patient analyze intention-to-treat analysis , suitable per-protocol analysis . 3 . Consent study Consent study inclusion seek explanation agreement specific aneurysm treatment . Thus , patient capable consent aneurysm treatment get study detail explain may may agree participate . If patient incapable consent propose treatment , legal representative inform condition treatment choice afterwards , detail EARLYDRAIN study . A patient may randomize legal representative give informed consent study , base presumed patient . If neither patient capable give informed consent legal representative available due time , independent physician involve patient 's treatment trial may ask study approval . In case deferred consent , legal representative need establish soon possible , accord German law . As soon legal representative available and/or patient capable consent study , must ask give informed consent . If patient his/her legal representative refuse consent inclusion advice independent physician , study participation patient possible . In case , however , patient his/her legal representative ask give consent evaluation already acquire data . 4 . Safety lumbar drain aneurysmal SAH In three retrospective study , mortality lower lumbar drainage group . None retrospective study mention procedural related complication lumbar drain ( Klimo et al , Kwon et al , Tizi et al ( abstract DGNC 2009 ) ) . In patient increased intracranial pressure , careful lumbar drainage CSF may possible treatment even case compress basal cistern ( Tuettenberg et al ) . To date , data available indicating increase risk lumbar drainage control neurointensive care environment . 5 . Insurance coverage As EARLYDRAIN study compare two standard procedure CSF drainage subarachnoid hemorrhage use clinical routine , additional patient insurance necessary perform study . German law §§ 40 42 Arzneimittelgesetz §§ 20 23 Medizinproduktegesetz applicable . Any hypothetical adverse event either treatment cover regular treatment contract include clinical research .</detailed_description>
