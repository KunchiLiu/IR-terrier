	<brief_title>A Study Paliperidone Palmitate Japanese Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , flexible-dose , multicenter study . The study consist 3 period : up-to-2-week pre-observation ( screen ) period , observation period Day 1 ( baseline ) Week 49 ( end observation period ) assessment , post-observation period Week 49 ( end-of-observation period ) assessment Week 57 . For patient discontinue study last assessment Week 49 , post observation period start discontinuation observation period assessment follow-up visit 4 , 8 , 12 week last injection . The total duration study 57 week , include observation post observation period . Approximately 200 men woman , age 20 year old meet DSM-IV-TR criterion schizophrenia least 1 year screen Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) total score 60 120 screen baseline enrol , least 100 patient complete 1-year study . The patient primary active Axis I disorder schizophrenia enrol study . Eligible patient administer initial loading dose paliperidone palmitate 150 mg eq . im Day 1 100 mg eq . 1 week later deltoid muscle . The study drug administer flexible dose range 25 150 mg eq . 4-week interval Week 5 either deltoid gluteal muscle injection total 11 injection . A dose 75 mg eq . recommend Week 5 Week 45 . The study drug administer study drug manager and/or injector . Each dose increase increment 50 mg eq . less . Dose increase consider increase PANSS total score ( individual item total ) Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI-S ) score precede assessment . Dose decrease consider adverse event occur appear causal relationship investigational drug . The injection site ( deltoid gluteal ) , principle , fix fourth injection thereafter , injection deltoid gluteal muscle alternate discretion investigator consider appropriate patient 's safety . If repeat injection administer either deltoid gluteal muscle , alternate side injection ( left right ) recommend . The choice injection needle determine patient 's weight injection site . The weight baseline ( Day 1 ) use choose needle injection Day 1 Week 21 , weight Week 25 use choosing needle injection Week 25 thereafter . Patients weigh less 200 lb ( &lt; 90 kg ) receive deltoid injection 1-inch needle ( 23 G×1 '' ) . Patients weigh 200 lb ( =90 kg ) , receive deltoid injection 1.5-inch needle ( 22 G×1 1/2 '' ) . All gluteal injection administer 1.5-inch needle ( 22 G×1 1/2 '' ) . The sponsor collect adverse event start signing informed consent form completion end-of-study procedure . Adverse event follow investigator recovers consider clinically stable . Adverse event include occurrence new onset aggravate severity frequency baseline condition , abnormal result diagnostic procedure , include laboratory test abnormality . Blood sample ( preferably fast ) , serum chemistry hematology random urine sample urinalysis , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , vital sign , height , weight , waist circumference , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale ( DIEPSS ) , Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) , evaluation injection site Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) patient 's assessment injection pain also collect safety evaluation . PANSS total score CGI-S score collect efficacy evaluation . Samples pharmacokinetic evaluation collect designated timepoints . An optional 10-mL pharmacogenomic blood sample collect patient provide separate write informed consent part study . The patient receive paliperidone palmitate intramuscular ( im ) initial load dose 150 mg eq . treatment Day 1 100 mg eq . 1 week later deltoid muscle . The study drug administer flexible dose range 25 150 mg eq . 4-week interval Week 5 either deltoid gluteal muscle injection total 11 injection . A dose 75 mg eq . recommend Week 5 Week 45 .</detailed_description>
