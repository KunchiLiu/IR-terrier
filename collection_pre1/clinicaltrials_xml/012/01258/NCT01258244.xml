	<brief_summary>The quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) provide patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) often suboptimal . There exist monitors/defibrillators allow measurement real time feedback quality chest compression ventilation . In addition give prehospital provider benefit real time CPR quality feedback via voice visual cue , CPR quality data acquire use device utilized part on-going quality assurance/quality improvement program . The first objective propose project quantify quality chest compression ventilation provide state Arizona patient OHCA determine whether quality CPR related patient outcome OHCA . A second objective project determine whether use audiovisual feedback improve CPR quality patient outcome pre-hospital setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arizona Prehospital CPR Quality Improvement Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I : In first phase project , EMS system utilize E-series unit treat patient OHCA . The audiovisual feedback prompt inactivated phase . The EMS provider instruct follow standard CCR protocol , currently practice . Aside change monitor/defibrillator equipment , treatment OHCA patient phase identical treatment currently perform . The quality CPR measure use accelerometer-based system . The data store defibrillator download upon completion call . The first phase conduct approximately 6 month time site initiate use E-series monitor/defibrillators . Phase 2 : In second phase project , EMS provider undergo train use audiovisual feedback prompt . The provider continue treat patient accord CCR protocol receive audio and/or visual feedback quality CPR performing . The provider select prefer feedback method ( ) - audio , visual . As phase I , CPR data store defibrillator download upon completion call . The total number EMS personnel train approximately 450 . In Phase I , 219 OHCAs ( 80 % Mesa Fire Dept , 20 % Guardian Medical Transport ) . So far Phase II , 100 OHCAs .</detailed_description>
