	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well aldesleukin without ziv-aflibercept work treat patient stage III-IV melanoma remove surgery . Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cell kill cancer . Ziv-aflibercept may stop growth melanoma block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether aldesleukin effective without ziv-aflibercept treating melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aldesleukin With Without Ziv-Aflibercept Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test hypothesis combination biotherapy aflibercept ( ziv-aflibercept ) high-dose ( HD ) interleukin ( IL ) -2 ( aldesleukin ) improve progression-free survival compare HD IL-2 alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) aflibercept HD IL-2 assess Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria version 1.1 compare result HD IL-2 alone . II . Evaluate toxicity tolerance combination biotherapy aflibercept HD IL-2 maintenance aflibercept alone patient population compare HD-IL2 alone . III . Test hypotheses related laboratory correlative study . IV . Evaluate overall survival patient treat aflibercept HD IL-2 HD IL-2 alone . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously ( IV ) least 1 hour day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ( week 9 course 1 ) high-dose aldesleukin IV 15 minute every 8 hour 5 day week 1 3 ( week 3 5 course 1 ) . Treatment repeat every 8 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive maintenance therapy comprise ziv-aflibercept IV day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive high-dose aldesleukin IV 15 minute every 8 hour 5 day week 1 3 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-4 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
