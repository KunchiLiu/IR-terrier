	<brief_title>Ofatumumab Minimal Residual Disease ( MRD ) Maintenance Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Ofatumumab design bind surface white blood cell ( B-cells ) kill cell . It destroy cancer cell come B-cells , use treat cancer B-cells B-CLL . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive ofatumumab 20 time study . You receive 8 weekly infusion infusion every 2 month 2 year disease get bad . You receive ofatumumab vein 6 Â½ hour first time 4 hour follow infusion . The first infusion small dose . The second late infusion 3 time large first . Before receive study drug time , receive Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) mouth reduce risk fever . You receive Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) mouth vein prednisolone ( steroid ) vein 30 minute reduce risk allergic reaction infusion reaction . During infusion , monitor closely . You expect stay clinic 71/2 hour day first infusion 5 hour infusion . You see MD Anderson mandatory visit enrollment , ofatumumab infusion , response assessment 8 weekly ofatumumab dos ( Month 3 ) , maintenance every 6 month follow-up least year . Your local doctor may perform visit laboratory study . If decide local doctor perform study visit laboratory study , letter send doctor , describe participation study ask doctor 's agreement help manage care . Study Visits : The following test procedure perform every week Weeks 1- 8 ( Weeks 1 , 3 , 5 7 ) : - You complete physical exam include measurement vital sign . - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test .

Follow Up Visits : Every 3 Months : - You complete physical exam include measurement vital sign . - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon every 3 month , 1 teaspoon every 6 month ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw hepatitis testing . Every 6 Months , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease . This investigational study . Ofatumumab FDA approve CLL resistant standard chemotherapy . Ofatumumab 's use patient residual CLL SLL investigational . Up 42 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
