	<brief_title>Study See How Low Level Laser Light Affects Subcutaneous Fat Around Hips Waist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laser therapy provide alternative therapeutic regimen reduction subcutaneous tissue volume . Although biochemical mechanism yet fully understood , histological study clearly effectively identify formation transitory pore subsequent cell collapse immediately follow laser irradiation . More importantly , placebo-controlled , randomize , double-blind clinical investigation use Erchonia MLS 67 enrol participant reveal statistically significant reduction overall circumference measurement waist , hip , thighs follow two week treatment , result Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) clearance indication . Laser therapy operate principle photochemistry , activate and/or suppress natural biochemical process . Because Low Level Laser Therapy ( LLLT ) induce cellular apoptosis , upregulation pro-inflammatory cytokine large burden place lymphatic system . The fatty material secrete adipocytes follow laser irradiation absorb lymphatic system , break liver , naturally secrete . Fatty acid release bound albumin , transport circulatory system liver undergo fatty acid oxidation . The triglyceride release bound lipoproteins transport liver process . Moreover , lipase know lipoprotein lipase , demonstrate breakdown emulsified triglyceride ; therefore break molecule three fatty acid one glycerol molecule . The important aspect laser therapy cellular apoptosis induce . The fatty material evacuate cell must absorb lymphatic system , laser therapy destroy cell , complex organelle entire cell structure absorb lymphatic system . It well understood much lymphatic system absorb ; therefore , create mass amount cellular debris destroy adipose tissue may result serious long term effect . Moreover , adipose tissue compose fat store cell ; also collection immune cell , fibroblast , vessel , stromal stem cell . By create transitory pore fat storing cell , viability surrounding , non-fat storing cell preserve . The purpose pilot study demonstrate document anatomical modulation subcutaneous fat across waist hip occur application Erchonia® ML Scanner ( MLS ) Laser manufacture non-invasive body contour waist hip .</detailed_description>
