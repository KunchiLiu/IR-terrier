	<brief_title>Study Effect Low Level Laser Light Hair Growth Female Human Scalp</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 20 million woman United States suffer hair loss , 40 % woman forty year age . The emotional aspect hair loss female include anxiety depression , frustration poor self-esteem . Androgenetic alopecia common cause female bald likely reason excessive hair loss . It believe light therapy scalp provide effective mean reduce hair loss and/or stimulate hair growth females androgenetic alopecia . Results previous study low level laser therapy ( LLLT ) demonstrate variety vitro vivo effect include increase blood flow , accelerate wound healing , enhance production cytokine cellular mediator , increase cellular proliferation , among panoply effect . Enhanced hair growth observe adjacent treat area various animal model investigate effect LLLT . Uncontrolled study human spa-based therapy Europe appear show periodic application low intensity light therapy reduce hair loss appear increase hair growth . The majority application utilize light red near-infrared portion spectrum . The Erchonia MLS low level laser evaluate potential improve quality quantity hair female scalp . This may improve quality life result improve self-image may potentially delay reduce need surgical procedure hair transplantation . A successful local therapy would mitigate reduce need systemic agent minoxidil finasteride , thereby minimize potential side effect therapy .</detailed_description>
