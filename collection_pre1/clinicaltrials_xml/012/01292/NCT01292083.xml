	<brief_title>Azacitidine Treating Patients With Triple Negative Stage I-IV Invasive Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ability deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation inhibition use 5-azacitidine induce expression estrogen receptor ( ER ) progesterone receptor ( PR ) gene solid human triple negative invasive breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect systemic 5-azacitidine therapy expression methylated gene triple negative invasive breast cancer use Illumina GoldenGate array . OUTLINE : Patients receive azacitidine intravenously ( IV ) 10-40 minute 5 day week 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo definitive breast surgery within 12 day last dose azacitidine .</detailed_description>
