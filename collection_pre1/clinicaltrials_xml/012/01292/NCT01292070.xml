	<brief_summary>The purpose trial show Intradermal Human Fcγ1-Fel d1 fusion protein ( GFD ) able block skin reaction cat allergen cat allergic subject compare skin reaction cat allergen alone . This research project also test safety tolerability new , experimental treatment , compare current treatment cat allergen alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Researchers conduct research study new protein develop treat sensitivity cat allergen . Cat allergy human allergic reaction one five know allergen produce cat . The common protein Fel 1 . This study test Intradermal Human Fcγ1-Fel d1 fusion protein ( GFD ) , new protein , base animal data , develop block allergic effect cat . If drug work way think , may become treatment cat allergy faster currently available treatment few side effect . This protein contain molecule cat , cause allergic reaction , attached section particular antibody ( protein involve immunity ) call Fcγ1 act like break . The fusion two protein predict interrupt flow cellular reaction lead allergic response . This first time GFD administer human . The study conduct two part . The subject part A administer intradermal standardized cat hair allergenic extract ( CAT ) GFD sequentially 10-fold increase dos every 20 minute . If Part A demonstrate safety GFD , subject part B begin follow treatment part A follow rechallenge site CAT 4 hour first dose GFD . Each subject evaluate 3 time ( screen , dose , telephone follow-up 2 day post dose ) return Day 28 blood draw .</detailed_description>
