	<brief_summary>This open-label , Phase I/II study intravitreally administer ranibizumab either 0.5-mg and/or 2.0-mg subject clinical , angiographic , ocular coherence tomography ( OCT ) evidence diabetic retinopathy associate diabetic macular edema follow bevacizumab therapy . Thirty patient enrol study . Consented , enrol subject receive multiple open-label intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab administer every 30 day ( ±7 day ) 3 injection mandatory treatment phase ( Day 0 , Month 1 , Month 2 ) . Subjects complete resolution diabetic macular edema 3 intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab treat necessary 0.5 mg ranibizumab treat recurrent macular edema additional 9 month ( 12 month Day 0 ) . The intent administer additional ranibizumab treatment evidence disease activity document OCT ( e.g. , intra-retinal fluid , subretinal fluid and/or cystic change ) . Subjects residual diabetic macular edema follow 3 intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab receive 3 intravitreal injection 2.0 mg ranibizumab administer every 30 day ( ±7 day ) 3 injection Month 3 , Month 4 , Month 5 study visit . Beginning Month 6 study visit , subject complete resolution diabetic macular edema follow 3 intravitreal injection 2.0 mg ranibizumab treat necessary 2.0 mg ranibizumab injection treat recurrent macular edema additional 6 month ( 12 month Day 0 ) . Subjects residual diabetic macular edema follow 3 consecutive intravitreal injection 2.0 mg ranibizumab treat necessary 2.0 mg ranibizumab treat persistent recurrent macular edema additional 6 month ( 12 month Day 0 ) . Focal photocoagulation intravitreal triamcinolone may administer physician 's discretion adjunct ranibizumab injection begin Month 6 Month 12 study . All subject make monthly visit 12 month evaluation safety efficacy . All subject first injection ranibizumab Day 0 undergo safety visit one week ( ±2 day ) first injection . At subsequent visit , subject safety evaluation monthly schedule follow-up visit prior intravitreal injection . Subjects contact site personnel 1-2 day injection elicit report decrease vision pain unusual new ocular symptom study eye .</brief_summary>
