	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Photodynamic therapy use drug becomes active expose certain kind light . When drug active , cancer cell kill . Photodynamic therapy use methyl-5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride cream may effective skin cancer . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose photodynamic therapy methyl-5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride cream determine pain threshold patient skin cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy Using Methyl-5-Aminolevulinate Hydrochloride Cream Determining Pain Threshold Patients With Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine `` low '' initial irradiance cause minimal ( pain grade &lt; 4 ) time period 90 +/- 10 % photo bleach protoporphyrin IX ( PplX ) lesion occur , precede `` high '' irradiance portion MAL/PDT . II . To determine effect precede `` low '' irradiance pain level `` high '' irradiance portion MAL-PDT . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect irradiance lesion perfusion . II . To determine PpIX Total Vit D content blood . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To monitor clinical outcome treatment initial response recurrence . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . GROUP I : Patients apply methyl-5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride ( MAL ) cream lesion surround normal skin . Beginning 3 hour later , patient undergo laser light treatment 3-5 minute . GROUP II : Patients apply MAL cream lesion surround normal skin . Beginning 3 hour later , patient undergo light-emitting diode treatment 10-20 minute . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5-7 day , 6-12 month , 24 month .</detailed_description>
