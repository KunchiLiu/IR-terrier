	<brief_title>Restoration Upper Limb Function Individuals With Sub-Acute Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sustaining spinal cord injury impose significant physical dependency result financial psychological challenge individual , family community large . For person cervical level injury ( tetraplegia ) , often loss hand upper limb function , one devastating consequence spinal cord injury . The use hand upper limb need daily activity feed , dress , bath toileting . Good hand function play important role ability transfer bed wheelchair , sit lie . Not surprisingly , majority people tetraplegia rate recovery hand function high priority . One promising approach improve hand function functional electrical stimulation , use burst short electrical pulse generate muscle contraction . Functional electrical stimulation enables person , would otherwise paralyzed hand , grasp release object . Although Canadian researcher forefront upper limb rehabilitation , recently develop state-of-the-art therapeutic treatment involve functional electrical stimulation , strong need evaluate efficacy intervention . A similar situation also exist upper limb function assessment . At least three clinically promise upper limb assessment recently develop Canada individual spinal cord injury , require evaluation determine effectiveness . The objective research program conduct multi-site clinical randomize control trial evaluate efficacy functional electrical stimulation base upper limb intervention people tetraplegia . This involve recruit 84 person sub-acute tetraplegia across four site ( Montreal , Toronto , Fredericton Edmonton ) serve evaluate three new Canadian hand function assessment specifically develop person tetraplegia . Although assessment recently test show considerable promise , evaluation clinical utility ( particular responsiveness validity ) require . As well , need compare one another determine whether test appropriate clinical application whether test reduction augmentation may require . Having measure sensitive accurate assess hand function key systematically evaluate emerge therapeutic intervention . The finding multi-site clinical trial potential elevate current standard upper limb rehabilitation relate hand function provide high level evidence efficacy functional electrical stimulation therapy intervention . Also , dissemination new knowledge gain translate well clinical practice since occupational therapist able select good rehabilitation strategy improve hand function base solid evidence . By improve standard practice , person spinal cord injury access wider range treatment intervention restore improve function hand .</detailed_description>
