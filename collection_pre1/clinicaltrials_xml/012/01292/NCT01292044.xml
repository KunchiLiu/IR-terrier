	<brief_title>The Role Elastography Diagnosis Thyroid Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound consider first line examination exploration thyroid nodule . Echotexture analysis often identify nodule risk malignancy , replace exclude additional cytological exploration . Cytology , although effective , also limitation , particularly sample vesicular difficult discern benign malignant state . The creation noninvasive method context could help avoid invasive test `` useless '' surgical procedure . Ultrasound elastography , assess tissue deformability , may provide valuable information concern benign soft tissue characteristic , whereas malignant lesion harder consistency . Interest method , already propose organ , recently increase due emergence specifically create software enables objective evaluation hardness nodule conventional ultrasound analysis . The main hypothesis study elastography allow good selection candidate thyroid surgery .</detailed_description>
