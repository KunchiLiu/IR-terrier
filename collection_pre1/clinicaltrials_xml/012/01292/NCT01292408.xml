	<brief_summary>Hydroxychloroquine drug use treat malaria rheumatism . It recently discover Hydroxychloroquine increase 'autophagy ' . Autophagy process whereby cell eat part give extra energy . Cancer cell use autophagy survive chemotherapy hormonal therapy . Also , cancer cell use autophagy survive area tumor low oxygen level . The purpose study determine whether treatment drug Hydroxychloroquine lead decrease autophagy breast cancer tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autophagy Inhibition Using Hydrochloroquine Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In response various stress , cell launch process `` self-eating '' , term autophagy . Thereby , component cell catabolically digest via specific lysosome call autophagosomes , provide cell energy necessary factor serve temporary survival mechanism ( Chen et al . 2010 ) . Two major stressor evade autophagy important cancer progression treatment sensitivity : 1. cell respond autophagy cytotoxic treatment chemo- endocrine therapy , thereby lead treatment insensitivity ( Kondo et al . 2005 ; Chen et al . 2010 ) , 2. cell survive severe hypoxia use autophagy ( Rouschop et al . 2010 ) , hypoxic cell refractory chemo- , endocrine radiotherapy . Thus , tumor cell evade treatment induce cell death launch temporary last survival mechanism . Inhibition pathway could lead sensitization variety cancer treatment regimen , specific cell kill tumor associate hypoxic cell would otherwise refractory radiotherapy . Chloroquine ( CQ ) , N'- ( 7-chloroquinoline-4-yl ) -N , N-diethyl-pentane-1,4-diamine , discover 1934 , widely use effective safe anti-malarial anti-rheumatoid agent since 1947 . Later , CQ rediscover sensitizer cytotoxic cancer therapy ionize radiation chemotherapeutics , although precise mechanism behind remain largely unknown ( Solomon Lee 2009 ) . Most recently , discover CQ inhibits process autophagy impairment autophagic vesicle clearance , CQ accumulate lysosomal vesicle . This lead several investigator propose CQ one analog use inhibit autophagic pathway additive cytotoxic treatment . Hydrochloroquine ( HCQ , Plaquenil ) CQ derivative few side effect CQ , long use anti-malarial antirheumatoid agent . It safely use high dos extend period time . Both CQ HCQ investigation clinical trial glioblastoma , small non-small cell lung cancer , breast cancer , prostate cancer , melanoma , renal cell carcinoma , pancreatic cancer ( review see Solomon Lee 2009 Chen et al . 2010 ) . However , effect HCQ tumor tissue , autophagy and/or oxygenation yet study human patient vivo . In pilot study intend investigate effect HCQ breast cancer tissue . To end , breast cancer patient give informed consent participation AFTER study ( AMO 2010/312 ) , include tissue biopsy find ER/PgR negative , ask take 800 mg , 400 mg/day HCQ 2 3 week surgery . We compare tissue characteristic treatment use HCQ , look effect marker hypoxia autophagy use immunohistochemistry . We expect treatment HCQ tumor cell hypoxic area longer able survive , thus decrease number viable hypoxic cell increase amount necrosis . This pilot study serve proof principle future study effect autophagy inhibition treatment sensitivity breast cancer</detailed_description>
