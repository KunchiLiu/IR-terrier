	<brief_summary>Because metastatic liver cancer colon rectum , patient treat cytotoxic drug ( chemotherapy ) . In Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre investigator investigate whether image technique early stage treatment predict patient benefit treatment . In study investigator use two different scanner : MR ( magnetic resonance ) scanner PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) scanner combine CT ( Computer Tomography ) scanner . An MR scanner large magnet look like CT scanner also make picture . But instead use X-rays recording make magnetic field . The scan consist table patient lie head half-dome camera . The examination MR scan painful harmful . The PET scan type CT scan make ( administration radioactive liquid ) , scan ( part ) body . The amount radioactivity use study small adverse impact patient . This research two time combine '' normal '' CT scan . Using MR scan , investigator research oxygensupply , aggressiveness tumour degree liver metastases die chemotherapy . The investigator also , administration MR contrast agent , investigate blood supply tumor imaging . If treat chemotherapeutic drug capecitabine investigator monitor intake agent liver metastasis . The PET CT scan tell u metabolism liver metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-modality Imaging Prediction Response Systemic Treatment Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer frequently occur cancer half patient develop distant metastasis liver . Only subset patient respond systemic treatment , potentially toxic expensive . Therefore , predictive marker need determine treatment efficacy early stage . Preferably , provide insight biology colorectal cancer liver metastasis . In past show several biomarkers assess PET , MRI MRS serve predictive marker . Response systemic therapy depend several factor : delivery drug tumor vascular system ; cellular uptake , retention metabolism ; intrinsic sensitivity specific drug . The relative contribution factor response different different drug . Since systemic treatment colorectal cancer involve combination drug , predictive marker sensitive range factor . In project propose integrate analysis noninvasive functional molecular vivo image method order predict response treatment patient liver metastasis colorectal cancer . Tumor vascularity assess dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) . The fluoropyrimidines FU capecitabine - part standard treatment regimens - contain fluorine atom measure fluorine-19 MR spectroscopy ( 19F MRS ) . The intracellular uptake metabolism drug energy-consuming process . 18F-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) provide information glucose uptake hexokinase activity . Tumor characterization term grade aggressiveness may give relevant approximation intrinsic sensitivity tumor drug . With 1H MRS total amount choline ( tCho ) , precursor cell membrane , measure . Tumor cellularity extracellular matrix composition assess diffusion weight MRI ( DWI ) . The aim study obtain data biology data colorectal cancer liver metastasis , namely tumor vascularization ( DCE-MRI ) , tumor cellularity ( DWI ) , tumor ( choline ) metabolism ( 1H MRS ) tumor glucose metabolism ( FDG-PET ) . These data correlate clinical outcome patient drug uptake metabolism ( 19F MRS ) . We study relative contribution image method predict outcome patient colorectal cancer early stage . Research question : 1 . Do pre-treatment characteristic liver metastasis colorectal cancer assess dynamic contrast enhance MRI ( DCE-MRI ) , diffusion weight MRI ( DWI ) , 1H MR spectroscopy ( MRS ) FDG-PET predict treatment outcome ? 2 . Do early change ( one week start treatment ) DCE-MRI , DWI , 1H MRS FDG-PET characteristic liver metastases colorectal cancer predict treatment outcome ? 3 . Do 19F MRS parameter fluoropyrimidine metabolism liver metastases colorectal cancer predict treatment outcome early stage ( one week start treatment ) ? 4 . What relative contribution mention image method predict treatment outcome colorectal liver metastasis ? Design : 60 patient liver metastasis colorectal cancer treat fluoropyrimidine-based therapy participate study . Baseline 1H MRS liver perform session 3 Tesla follow DCE-MRI DWI 1.5 Tesla . FDG-PET add standard baseline CT scan , use clinical PET-CT scanner . DCE-MRI , DWI , 1H 19F MRS well FDG-PET liver repeat one week start treatment . Clinical response evaluate three treatment cycle FDG-PET-CT. We assess relative contribution image method well integrate use method identification predictive biomarkers response treatment . Relevance study : Since response tumor systemic drug may highly variable patient , method predicts sensitivity tumor treatment early stage would enable individualization therapy consequently would protect patient toxic effect ineffective treatment . Preferably , predictive marker also give u insight biology colorectal cancer . For reason propose study combination vivo noninvasive image method allow monitor relevant biomarkers</detailed_description>
