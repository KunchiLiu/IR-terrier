	<brief_title>Aripiprazole Effects Alcohol Drinking Craving</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-treatment seek individual meet criterion alcohol dependence ( N=120 ) recruit advertisement pay participation . Subjects blood drawn DNA analysis various brain dopamine system gene . Alcoholics , baseline evaluation , assign urn randomization one two experimental group , depend baseline level impulsivity , receive either aripiprazole ( 15 mg/day ) identical placebo . Subjects take study drug placebo 8 day ( day 1-6 natural observation period ) . After minimum 24 hour abstinence alcohol ( day 7-8 ) undergo alcohol administration ( prim dose ) motivate free choice drinking procedure ( day 8 ) . Alcoholic subject receive brief counseling session end study enhance awareness problem drinking motivate seek treatment . Referral treatment offer . Each subject undergo functional MRI ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) brain scan cue stimulation day 7 , even alcohol administration paradigm . fMRI ( functional magnetic resonance ) image brain imaging technology use determine alcoholic treat aripiprazole differ alcohol cue-induced activity nucleus accumbens . It hypothesize aripiprazole reduce nucleus accumbens activation alcohol cue compare placebo . Whether dopamine system genetic difference predict drinking , nucleus accumbens activity , aripiprazole response explore .</detailed_description>
