	<brief_title>Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) Contrast Media Induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Over last decade grow demand appropriate diagnosing intervention field modern medicine increase necessity use iodinate contrast medium ( CM ) . Patients pre-existing impaired renal function prone develop acute contrast medium induce nephropathy ( CIN ) consecutively great risk death . To date , reliable laboratory value test recognize acute renal damage serum creatinine increase still seek . It would helpful tool initiate proper treatment time . Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) , new biomarker predictive acute renal injury show capable early diagnosis contrast medium induce nephropathy ( CIN ) patient undergo cardiac surgery . So far , intravenous volume load fairly prove widely accept prophylaxis . However , optimal intravenous fluid regimen regard type , amount , route duration volume application remain controversial . Habits give pre- post-procedural volume widely differ throughout randomize trial , thus , comparable available study . Unfortunately , study also lack statistical power , use different type contrast medium ( CM ) definition contrast medium induce nephropathy ( CIN ) allow additional prophylactic measure , N-acetylcysteine sodium bicarbonate vary percentage patient . In randomize controlled study , patient need intra-arterial contrast medium ( CM ) application include . Patients schedule diagnostic angiography and/or endovascular intervention receive standardize , weight-based , intravenous hydration investigation . Only one type contrast medium ( CM ) neither sodium bicarbonate , N-acetylcysteine use throughout study . The study perform accord Consort-Statement 2010 clinical trial . It aim study : 1. evaluate magnitude risk contrast medium induce nephropathy ( CIN ) follow intra-arterial angiography well define group high-risk patient . 2. use urinary Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) early predictor contrast medium induce nephropathy ( CIN ) contrast medium ( CM ) application . 3. evaluate clinical benefit early post-procedural i.v . hydration compare pre-procedural volume expansion . Patients markedly increase Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) value ( criterion randomization one two treatment group see ) 4 6 hour investigation randomize one two study group : Patients Group A additionally receive 3-4 ml/kg BW/h 0.9 % saline intravenously 6 hour . Patients Group B undergo standard treatment consist unrestricted oral fluid intake , least 500 ml tea water provide ward , intravenous fluid application . Criteria Randomization ( 2nd NGAL test ) : - Patients NGAL level &gt; 150 ng/ml , baseline 75 ng/ml . - Patients double NGAL value , baseline 75 150 ng/ml . Endpoints : Primary endpoint : contrast medium induce nephropathy ( CIN ) define increase great 25 % baseline serum creatinine . Secondary endpoint : NGAL , Cystatin C , creatinine value , need renal replacement therapy , death .</detailed_description>
