	<brief_summary>Atlantoaxial subluxation ( AAS ) complication rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) due pannus formation around odontoid process C2 cervical spine . It occur frequently 15-30 % RA patient . AAS may occur relatively early course disease within first year . The diagnosis AAS identify patient population poor outcome . There evidence combination treatment disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARD ) may retard development AAS . However , know whether treatment inhibitor tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF ) may lead regression cervical pannus prevention reduction AAS . Clinical study analyse effectiveness TNF-inhibitors combine conventional DMARD therapy , treatment cervical spine involvement lead AAS , need . This proposal pilot study aim assess feasibility MRI-based measurement pannus volume patient treatment TNF-inhibitor . Primary objective : To show measurement pannus mass MRI feasible . Secondary objective : To assess whether pannus mass decrease measurably patient treat TNF-inhibitors . This pilot study prospective , non-randomized . The choice therapy time study entirely treat rheumatologist .</brief_summary>
