	<brief_summary>Colon cancer one common cancer France 36,000 new case per year . Despite significant advance therapeutic care , prognosis colon cancer metastases remain bad . The treatment metastatic disease base chemotherapy couple therapeutic antibody . The commonly use anti-EGFR ( Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ) , allow significant increase patient survival . They responsible skin toxicity form acneiform rash debilitate patient require discontinuation treatment . However , toxicity strongly correlate treatment efficacy . Understanding mechanisms cutaneous side effect anti-EGFR therefore major challenge treat well understand association treatment efficacy . The objective study investigate link cutaneous inflammatory response patient treat anti-EGFR , serum level anti-EGFR treatment efficacy . It conduct systematic consultation dermatology , skin biopsy blood sample patient treat anti-EGFR . From biopsy , search infiltration inflammatory cell expression gene involve skin inflammation .</brief_summary>
