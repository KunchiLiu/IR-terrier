	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) remain one major cause premature death world . There substantial evidence indicate cell line inner surface artery play major role protection development progression CHD . This layer cell term endothelium regulates vascular tone promote expansion contraction blood vessel . There variety non-invasive technique measure endothelial function . Research provide evidence consumption diet high plant food rich polyphenols associate reduction incidence coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Polyphenols , flavonoids large group , think play role reduction incidence chronic diseases cardiovascular disease stroke . Recent study humans show flavonoid-rich food improve peripheral blood flow surrogate marker cardiovascular function . These effect associate acute elevation level circulate nitric oxide specie , enhance flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) response conduit artery , augment microcirculation . Increases circulate nitric oxide specie response flavonoid ingestion suggest circulate flavonoid ( and/or metabolic form ) may exert positive effect vascular tone . The purpose study assess impact acute flavonoid intake postprandial vascular reactivity healthy volunteer . Specifically , investigator plan perform randomised , double blind , cross-over human intervention trial use blueberry drink investigate dose-dependent effect blueberry use range technique measure endothelial function . The study measure acute effect flavonoid ingestion vascular reactivity also assess flavonoid metabolite level blood urine endothelial marker .</detailed_description>
