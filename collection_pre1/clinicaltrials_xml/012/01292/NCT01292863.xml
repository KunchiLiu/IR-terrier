	<brief_title>The Impact Delflex Mesothelial Cell Viability Peritoneal Transport</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In spite benefit , many peritoneal dialysis patient ultimately switch dialysis therapy hemodialysis secondary technique failure . Numerous etiology peritoneal dialysis treatment failure exist include continuous exposure peritoneal membrane bioincompatible dialysis solution acidic pH high content glucose degradation product . These factor implicate mesothelial cell loss , fibrosis neovascularization , result alteration solute transport ultrafiltration failure . Novel peritoneal dialysis solution neutral pH low concentration glucose degradation product recently develop improve biocompatibility ameliorate consequence membrane damage conventional peritoneal dialysis solution . While novel peritoneal dialysis solution available outside United States several year , Delflex Neutral pH recently approve use United States . Thus , majority data support benefit novel solution come location outside United States . The central question regard novel peritoneal dialysis solution whether long term use result well preservation peritoneal membrane support dialysis . Ultimately , determine study compare long term outcomes patient use various solution . However , give expected availability United States potential benefit novel peritoneal dialysis solution long term study compare outcomes conventional solution raise ethical concern . Therefore , surrogate marker peritoneal membrane integrity necessary . Short term study use various surrogate marker assess mesothelial cell mass peritoneal inflammation Cancer Antigen 125 ( CA125 ) pro-inflammatory cytokine report , uncertain well marker predict long term outcome . Recently , novel approach predict outcome report , use mesothelial cell shed apoptosis . The number mesothelial cell number apoptotic mesothelial cell standard 8 hour dialysis dwell report correlate well deterioration peritoneal dialysis characteristic one year follow-up . The author conclude mesothelial cell shed apoptosis reliable predictor peritoneal membrane deterioration . The purpose study evaluate impact Delflex neutral pH ( biocompatible peritoneal dialysis solution ) mesothelial cell viability peritoneal transport . The study specifically compare mesothelial cell shed apoptosis peritoneal dialysis effluent exposure Delflex neutral pH solution conventional peritoneal dialysis solution . Cancer Antigen 125 ( CA125 ) level ( indicative mesothelial cell mass ) connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) level ( marker inflammation ) measure spent dialysate determine whether marker correlate cell shed apoptosis . The study also characterize transport glucose degradation product ( GDPs ) advance glycosylation end product ( AGEs ) across mesothelial cell exposure Delflex neutral pH solution versus conventional peritoneal dialysis solution .</detailed_description>
