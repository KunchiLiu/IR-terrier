	<brief_title>Study Effectiveness Green Diode Laser Light Body Shaping</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Weight loss body contour large , constantly-growing field cosmetic surgery . However , demand body shaping procedure constantly rise , demand procedure perform quickly , simply importantly , less invasively ; hence grow popularity non- minimally-invasive cosmetic surgery procedure . In 2005 , 7.5 million minimally-invasive cosmetic procedure perform , 35 % increase 2000 . In recent year , Erchonia Corporation , manufacturer low level laser , develop dual-diode laser emit 532 nm 635nm collimate line-generated beam emulsify fat . In August , 2010 , Erchonia® ML Scanner ( MLS ) 635nm cleared FDA use non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment reduction circumference hip , waist , thigh . It determine biochemical effect Erchonia® MLS stimulate mitochondrion adipocyte cell turn increase production ATP . The newly synthesize ATP trigger up-regulation cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) . cAMP show stimulate cytoplasmic lipase , trigger conversion triglyceride fatty acid glycerol easily pas cell membrane . The transitory pore evidence laser allow movement fatty acid , glycerol , triglyceride pass across membrane extra-cellular space . Through vasodilation nearby blood vessel artery , oxidization triglyceride fatty acid occurs within extra-cellular space . This pilot study apply Erchonia® MLS employ 532 nm green diode lieu 635 nm red diode compare result attain use 635 nm diode . The Sponsor believe use 532 nm diode may prove effective 635 nm diode combine reduction total procedure administration time 40 30 minute . It goal study evaluate hypothesis .</detailed_description>
