	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness two anticancer drug , everolimus pasireotide , patient thyroid cancer cancer longer respond treatment radioiodine deem unsafe patient receive additional radioiodine treatment . The investigator also want establish best manner take two medication use together treat thyroid cancer . In particular , investigator want know well give time add second medication first one stop work . This study also look specific substance call biomarkers blood , tumor tissue involve growth tumor cell , determine level biomarkers related response treatment development side effect . Everolimus , also know brand name , Afinitor , biologic drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment kidney cancer . It work prevent cancer cell multiply also make likely die treatment . Pasireotide also know name , SOM230 new medication yet approve FDA treatment cancer . It new form drug call octreotide , approve treatment cancer arise endocrine organ . Pasireotide work bind protein call somatostatin receptor , express many tissue throughout body include thyroid cancer cell . Pasireotide prevent action somatostatin binding receptor .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Histologic cytologic confirmation thyroid cancer ( papillary , follicular , medullary ) ; histologic variant Hurthle tall cell variant allow . 2 . Biochemical radiologic documentation disease progression within last 12 month prior enrollment . 3 . Presence least one site measurable disease accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria version 1.1 . 4 . Patient must radioiodine refractory disease define one follow condition : All case medullary thyroid carcinoma . No iodineuptake post radioactive iodine treatment scan ( presence low iodine diet thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) suppression ) anatomically define lesion qualifies target lesion RECIST criterion . OR • If demonstrable iodineuptake : last radioiodine therapy ( ≥ 100 mCi ) give within last 16 month OR give 16 month enrollment , evidence disease progression last two radioiodine treatment perform within 16 month ( dose ≥ 100mCi ) . OR If patient receive maximum cumulative life time dose radioactive iodine treatment least 600 mCi . If patient decline intolerant radioiodine therapy progressive disease , opinion treat physician , likely benefit biologic therapy rather iodine therapy e.g . patient heavy burden disease 5 .

Sustained clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia . Risk factor Torsades de Pointes hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia , cardiac failure , clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia , highgrade atrioventricular ( AV ) block . Concomitant disease ( ) could prolong QT autonomic neuropathy ( cause diabetes , Parkinson 's disease ) , HIV , cirrhosis , uncontrolled hypothyroidism cardiac failure . Concomitant medication ( ) know increase QT interval . 12 .
