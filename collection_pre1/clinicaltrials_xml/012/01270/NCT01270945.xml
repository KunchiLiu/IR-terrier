	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine CV-18C3 reduce rate restenosis time restenosis patient undergoing repeat peripheral artery revascularization versus control randomized standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Preliminary Efficacy Study Anti-inflammatory Therapeutic Antibody Reducing Restenosis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restenosis peripheral artery lesion remain challenge problem overcome percutaneous revascularization atherosclerotic disease femoropopliteal arterial system . Rates restenosis high 60 % year . Treatment option include medical therapy , angioplasty , arthrectomy stent placement . The heterogeneity disease patient , variable length target lesion presence unpredictable physical force require individualized treatment plan . Vascular response injury appear play important role development restenosis . IL-1α potent inflammatory cytokine play central role vascular inflammation vascular smooth muscle proliferation -- acute chronic injury . CV-18C3 antagonizes biologic activity IL-1α theorize prevent early IL-1α mediate inflammation lead vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy restenosis , well late IL-1α mediate atherosclerotic plaque formation .</detailed_description>
