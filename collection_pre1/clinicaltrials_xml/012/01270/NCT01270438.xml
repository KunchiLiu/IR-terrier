	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial study well give combination chemotherapy bevacizumab without RO4929097 work treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . RO4929097 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy bevacizumab effective RO4929097 treat patient colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Bevacizumab With Without RO4929097 Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate efficacy , determine progression-free survival , FOLFOX6 bevacizumab versus without gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 ( RO4929097 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate clinical benefit RO4929097 combination mFOLFOX6 bevacizumab , measure objective response rate . II . To evaluate safety tolerability RO4929097 combination mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy bevacizumab . III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) RO4929097 combination mFOLFOX6 bevacizumab . IV . To investigate PD response RO4929097 combination mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy bevacizumab , assess direct measurement gamma-secretase enzyme activity , tumor sample . V. ( Exploratory ) To investigate Notch signal pathway gene target RO4929097 combination mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy bevacizumab correlate clinical outcome . VI . ( Exploratory ) To investigate Ras signal pathway gene target RO4929097 combination mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy bevacizumab correlate clinical outcome . VII . ( Exploratory ) To investigate putative colorectal cancer stem cell target RO4929097 combination mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy bevacizumab correlate clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , prior therapy ( adjuvant/neoadjuvant v none ) , number organs* involve metastasis ( 1 v &gt; 1 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . NOTE : *Lesions liver would consider 1 organ involve . ARM I : Patients receive FOLFOX6 regimen comprise oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1-2 . Patients also receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 day 1-3 8-10 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( RO4929097 give 12 course ) . ARM II : Patients receive FOLFOX6 regimen bevacizumab arm I . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically study pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic , correlative study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
