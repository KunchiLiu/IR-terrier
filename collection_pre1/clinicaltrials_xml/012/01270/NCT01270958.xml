	<detailed_description>Rationale Allergic rhinitis IgE-mediated , inflammatory disorder upper airway occur follow allergen exposure . Perennial Allergic Rhinitis ( PAR ) start early childhood occurs year around . It 's cause allergy aerosolise droppings house dust mites pet skin flake ( dander ) . Occasionally , indoor mould spore , rare case , food allergy cause . Intranasal corticosteroids highly effective medication control nasal symptom accompany allergic rhinitis . AVAMYS ( TM ) ( fluticasone furoate aqueous nasal spray 100mcg ) show effect nasal symptoms seasonal perennial allergic rhinitis ocular symptom allergic rhinitis evaluate effective safe treatment seasonal perennial allergic rhinitis FDA . It speculate AVAMYS ( TM ) also effective safe Vietnamese patient . However use widely patient across country , AVAMYS ( TM ) prove safe Vietnamese patient . Objective ( ) The objective study evaluate safety fluticasone furoate aqueous nasal spray 110mcg daily adult PAR . As treatment duration duration PAR normally longer SAR , safety/tolerability evaluation PAR treatment well sufficient similar evaluation SAR . Safety Endpoints - Frequency solicit clinical adverse event ( headache , epistaxis , pharyngolaryngeal pain ) - Vital sign ( systolic diastolic blood pressure , heart rate [ pulse ] ) - Clinical laboratory test baseline , study termination , specifically follow : Chemistry : Glucose , ALT &amp; AST , Total Bilirubin , Alkaline phosphatase , Total Protein &amp; Albumin Hematology : Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) Pregnancy test : Urine pregnancy test female subject Screening , Visit 2 &amp; Visit 3 . • 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) baseline study termination Study Design This 6-week , open trial . A study center enlist recruite minimum 50 PAR subject . At visit 1 , subject fulfil inclusion criterion eligible include group self-administer intranasal treatment fluticasone furoate aqueous nasal spray 110 mcg daily 6 week . The subject instruct administer two spray device nostril daily every morning . Administration dose perform alternately spray one spray nostril follow second spray nostril . Subjects permit take anti-allergy rhinitis medication screen treatment period . Throughout study , subject document study drug administration/compliance , medical condition experience , concomitant medication take . All subject outpatient . Clinic visit study subject schedule occur follow interval : Screening visit : To collect Inform Consent Form evaluate eligibility , medical history , clinical status , electrocardiography necessary laboratory test . If subject eligible anti-histamin medication , he/she enter study right visit ( i.e . study medication ) . Visit 1 : Three five day screen visit . This visit due subject eligible anti-histamin medication screen visit . The subject must discontinue anti-histamin medication ( ) since screen visit . He/she clinically evaluate , prescribe study drug instruct fill Diary Card . Visit 2 : Fourteen ( ± 1 ) day Visit 1 Day 15 . Clinical evaluation , drug accountability , Diary card collection study-specific laboratory testing apply . Visit 3 : Forty-two ( ± 1 ) day Visit 1 . Clinical evaluation , drug accountability , Diary card collection study-specific laboratory testing apply . All study information Case Report Form ( CRF ) subject review . A PAR subject consider fulfill study visit complete . A follow-up telephone contact make 3 5 day Visit 3/Early Withdrawal assess adverse effect discontinue study treatment . Study Population A minimum 50 adult perennial allergic rhinitis ( PAR ) recruit study . Study Assessments The safety assessment include summary frequency type clinical adverse event occur study . In addition , hematology chemistry analyse blood sample also implement . A physical examination nasal examination also perform vital sign collect . Twelve-lead ECGs perform visit .</detailed_description>
