	<brief_summary>Hypothesis # 1 : Most child CKD stag 2-4 , ESRD kidney transplantation report participation physical activity fall short recommended level physical activity ; Children dialysis less active . Hypothesis # 2 : Patients endorse many barrier physical activity , related disease treatment ; le active endorse barrier . Hypothesis # 3 : Patients increase participation physical activity response pedometer-based 12 week intervention . Baseline level physical activity magnitude increase physical activity closely associate change physical functioning performance stage kidney disease type renal replacement therapy . Exercise capacity child measure six minute walk test whereby subject ask walk far possible 6 minute straight corridor . Body fat body composition measure Bioelectric Impedance Spectroscopy . Physical function Health Related Quality Life assess self reported/ parent proxy reliable validate questionnaire specifically design child chronic kidney disease call Pediatric Quality Life Inventory ( Peds QL 4.0 ) . Subjects ( teen ) parent also ask fill questionnaire barrier physical activity first visit . Physical activity measure form daily step . The child wear pedometer first week ass his/her baseline level activity . Then child continue wear pedometer another 12 week time ask gradually increase step walk per day baseline physical activity . The patient call week order monitor progress , set new weekly step goal ( usually 500-1000 steps/day great previous week ) , motivate participant . After 12 week pedometer-based intervention increase physical activity , physical performance , body composition physical functioning ( describe ) measure assess effect increase physical activity second visit .</brief_summary>
