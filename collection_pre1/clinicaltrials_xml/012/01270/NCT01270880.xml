	<brief_title>Hsp90 Inhibitor STA-9090 Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) achieve STA-9090 ( Hsp90 inhibitor STA-9090 ) men castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) receive prior docetaxel base therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess percentage change prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) baseline 12 week . II . To assess overall safety tolerability STA-9090 . III . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) outcome metastatic CRPC receive prior docetaxel therapy . IV . To investigate association progression-free survival ( PFS ) PSA response rate primary secondary target marker . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate potential marker predict drug response efficacy , blood sample use collect serum extract messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) mononuclear cell analyzed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor STA-9090 intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour weekly week 1-3 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 week .</detailed_description>
