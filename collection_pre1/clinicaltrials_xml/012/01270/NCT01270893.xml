	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn TasignaÂ® ( nilotinib ) cause tumor cell shrink and/or die patient GIST schedule surgery may eligible surgery . The safety drug study . Researchers also want use imaging scan study change tumor size may cause use nilotinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tasigna Neoadjuvant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor ( GIST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GIST rare cancer know soft-tissue sarcoma form gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract may spread part body . However , sometimes GIST stay GI tract may possibly remove surgery . While chemotherapy drug , imatinib mesylate , effective shrink control GIST , type GIST tumor respond imatinib . Researchers want find nilotinib ( drug similar imatinib ) cause GIST cell die , tumor shrink enough remove surgery . The Study Drugs : Nilotinib design prevent cell multiply cause tumor cell shrink and/or die . This may prevent cancer grow . Study Arms Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , surgeon M. D. Anderson check image scan decide tumor surgically remove . Participants research study assign either Arm 1 Arm 2 , base whether tumor able remove surgery point . Arm 1 : If surgeon think tumor able remove surgery , assign Arm 1 . You receive nilotinib pill mouth 2 time day 7 day . You receive pill diary show record date time dose receive . After week nilotinib therapy , schedule GIST remove surgery . Tumor tissue remove surgery use research test . Some test help researcher learn effectively nilotinib kill tumor cell . Your DNA RNA ( genetic material cell ) also collect tissue sample use help researcher understand tumor cell survive , divide , die result nilotinib . After 4-6 week recovery time surgery , receive standard care treatment off-study . An assigned research nurse see clinic visit serve first contact question concern . During course study , ask report serious problem concern study visit . If concern question study visit , may contact study nurse Sarcoma Center M. D. Anderson . Arm 1 Study Visits : Participants Arm 1 follow test procedure perform : On Day -7 , begin take nilotinib . On Day -1 : - You dynamic CT scan within 36 hour surgery check status disease . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ECG . On Day 0 , surgery remove GIST . On Day 56 : - You ask health , drug may take , side effect may experience . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - You chest x-ray . - You standard CT scan MRI scan check status disease . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 3 month : - You ask health , drug may take , side effect may experience . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - You standard CT scan MRI scan check status disease . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Arm 2 : If surgeon think tumor able surgically removed time , tumor need shrink remove surgery , assign Arm 2 . You receive nilotinib pill mouth 2 time day 7 day . You receive pill diary show record date time dose receive . After week nilotinib therapy , schedule biopsy count Day 0 pill diary . After 7 day recovery biopsy , continue receive nilotinib schedule ( 2 time day mouth ) . After 8 week nilotinib therapy , scan perform measure size tumor . These scan include CT scan abdomen pelvis . You may magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan instead , chronic kidney disease . If scan show tumor gotten small , meet surgeon discus surgery remove tumor . If schedule surgery , stop take nilotinib 1 day surgery date . If tumor gotten big , take study treatment , treatment option discuss . If scan show tumor unchanged , continue receive nilotinib tumor either shrink ( able surgery ) get big ( take study treatment ) . Tumor tissue remove schedule biopsy surgery also use biological genetic testing . After surgery , receive standard care treatment off-study , depend result surgery . Your doctor may recommend begin take imatinib mesylate surgery ( disease get worse able surgery ) . In many case , imatinib mesylate give daily basis 1-2 year low risk disease come back . During time surgery , information collect overall health . If disease get bad study , agree , ask tumor biopsy easily accessible area . If happens , procedure describe detail , sign separate consent . An assigned research nurse see clinic visit serve first contact question concern . During course study , ask report serious problem concern study visit . If concern question study visit , may contact study nurse Sarcoma Center M.D . Anderson . Arm 2 Study Visits : Participants Arm 2 follow test procedure perform : On Day -7 , begin take nilotinib . On Day -1 : - You dynamic CT scan within 36 hour biopsy check status disease . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ECG . On Day 0 : -You tumor tissue biopsy perform . To collect tumor tissue biopsy , skin around tumor area numb anesthetic , sample tumor tissue withdrawn large needle . On Day 56 : - You ask health , drug may take , side effect may experience . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - You chest x-ray . - You standard CT scan MRI scan check status disease . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Depending result test Day 56 either surgery , continue nilotinib , take study switch another therapy . Every 3 month : - You ask health , drug may take , side effect may experience . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status measure . - You standard CT scan MRI scan check status disease . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Additional Testing Both Groups : You blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . These PK sample draw first 6 day nilotinib ( Day -1 ) either end-of-treatment visit point disease get bad . When/if treatment interrupt reason and/or dose change way , also ECGs perform . You additional ECG 7 day . End-of-Treatment Visit : At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You performance status record . - You ask health , drug may take , side effect may experience . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You ECG . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 1 week ( Arm 1 ) surgery . You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest , able surgery ( Arm 2 ) . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Follow-up Testing : You ask return clinic every 3 month standard follow-up testing , include routine blood test CT scan . This investigational study . Nilotinib FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type chronic myeloid leukemia . Its use patient GIST investigational . Up 24 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
