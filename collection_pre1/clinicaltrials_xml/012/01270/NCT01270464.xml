The patient airway reversibility least 12 % betaagonist administration screening . The patient currently take fluticasone dosage least 440 μg daily ( equivalent ) . Patients ' baseline asthma therapy regimen ( include limit inhaled corticosteroid , leukotriene antagonist , 5lipoxygenase inhibitor , cromolyn ) must stable 30 day screen , continue without dosage change throughout study . The patient blood eosinophil count least 400/μL . Female patient must surgically sterile , 2 year postmenopausal , must negative pregnancy test ßHCG screening ( serum ) baseline ( urine ) .

Written inform consent obtain . Patients 12 17 year old , participate , need provide assent accordance local standard . Other inclusion criterion apply . The patient clinically meaningful comorbidity would interfere study schedule procedure , compromise patient 's safety . The patient know hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) . The patient another confound underlying lung disorder ( eg , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary fibrosis , lung cancer ) . The patient pulmonary condition symptoms asthma blood eosinophilia ( eg , ChurgStrauss syndrome , allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ) . The patient current smoker ( ie , smoke within last 6 month prior screen ) .
