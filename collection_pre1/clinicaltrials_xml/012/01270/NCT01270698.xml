	<brief_summary>This Phase I trial study safety IMMU-130 . IMMU-130 compose drug attach antibody . The drug active ingredient irinotecan common chemotherapy drug use colorectal cancer . Antibodies proteins normally make immune system . They bind substance n't belong body prevent harm body . The antibody study design bind marker locate colorectal cancer tumor . The antibody originally make mouse protein , change laboratory like human antibody . This study investigate IMMU-130 act treatment colorectal cancer . The study mainly do see IMMU-130 safe .</brief_summary>

Failed least one prior standard treatment regimen colorectal cancer Adequate performance status ( ECOG 0 1 ) Expected survival &gt; 6 month . CEA plasma level &gt; 5 ng/mL Measurable disease CT MRI At least 4 week beyond major surgery recover acute toxicity At least 2 week beyond corticosteroid , except low dos ( i.e. , 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) treat nausea illness rheumatoid arthritis Adequate hematology without ongoing transfusional support ( hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL , ANC &gt; 1,500 per mm3 , platelet &gt; 100,000 per mm3 ) Adequate renal hepatic function ( creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN , bilirubin ≤ IULN , AST ALT ≤ 3.0 x IULN 5 x IULN know liver metastasis ) . Otherwise , toxicity study entry &lt; Grade 1 NCI CTC v4.0 . Women pregnant lactating . Women childbearing potential fertile men unwilling use effective contraception study conclusion 12week posttreatment evaluation period . Patient 's Gilbert 's disease know CNS Metastatic disease . However , patient CNS metastases asymptomatic complete course therapy eligible study provide clinically stable 1 month prior entry define : ( 1 ) evidence new enlarge CNS metastasis ( 2 ) steroid stable dose steroid Patients CEA plasma level &gt; 1000 ng/mL exclude dose escalation , may include MTD determine Patients active grade 3 anorexia , nausea vomiting , and/or sign intestinal obstruction . Patients nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix exclude , patient prior malignancy must least 3year disease free interval . Patients know HIV positive , hepatitis B positive , hepatitis C positive . Known history unstable angina , MI , CHF present within 6 month clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia ( stable atrial fibrillation ) require antiarrhythmia therapy , Known history clinically significant active COPD , moderatetosevere chronic respiratory illness present within 6 month . Known autoimmune disease presence autoimmune phenomenon ( except rheumatoid arthritis require low dose maintenance corticosteroid , diabetes , vitiligo , stable thyroid disease ) . Infection require intravenous antibiotic use within 1 week . Other concurrent medical psychiatric condition , Investigator 's opinion , may likely confound study interpretation prevent completion study procedure followup examination .</criteria>
