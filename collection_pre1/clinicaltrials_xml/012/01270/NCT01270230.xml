Evidence thus far indicate BP acceptable feasible model provide HIV prevention counsel population , pilot outcome data show promising indication behavior change . A team train BP staff successfully utilized multi-tiered outreach approach identify AAMSMW , recruit eligible individual , engage retain participant longitudinal evaluation design . A randomized control trial BP necessary determine efficacy intervention lead improve public health effort reduce HIV risk behavior among AAMSMW African American community generally .</detailed_description>
