	<brief_title>The Effect Food Taste , Temperature , Viscosity Swallowing Efficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Swallowing problem ( dysphagia ) encounter frequently primary practice hospital setting . The list possible cause large , range stroke neurological disease complication cancer treatment , acid reflux , surgery . Many patient reduce ability feel food fluid ( reduced sensation ) within throat ( pharynx ) lead inability manipulate food fluid correct manner . This produce variety swallow problem choke food fluid , regurgitation , aspiration , weight loss , malnutrition poor quality life . Treatment dysphagia largely direct rehabilitation muscle power education safe swallow technique position limit food fluid enter airway . One widely accept treatment dysphagia alter texture food . Most patient dysphagia difficulty swallow thin liquid . By add thickener liquid , food bolus become cohesive , less likely become aspirate . Various type thicken product available over-the-counter without prescription . These thicken product bland currently flavor . We hypothesize alteration food taste ( sweet , salty , etcâ€¦ ) , viscosity , temperature , improve swallow efficiency . The purpose investigation evaluate effect food taste , texture , temperature swallow efficiency . The goal develop safer , good taste food product improve quality life patient disable swallow disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Normal Volunteers : Older 55 year age No history voice , swallow , reflux , progressive neurologic disease affect swallow mechanism . A normal selfadministered dysphagia questionnaire ( EAT10 score less three ) Patients Dysphagia Older 55 year age Patients follow condition : Dysphagia , globus , gastroesophageal reflux , condition require referral dynamic swallowing study . Patients willing provide write informed consent participation study . 1 . Patients unable complete administration full taste viscosity protocol . 2 . Patients profound dysphagia unable safely consume test solution . 3 . Patients known sensitivity allergies test solution . 4 . Patients prisoner . 5 . Patients history diabetes . 6 . Patients unable follow simple instruction swallow test solution instruction answer questionnaire .</criteria>
