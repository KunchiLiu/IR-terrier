	<detailed_description>The interplay genetic behavioral factor critical understanding obesity . Obesity major public health problem , million Americans suffer weight-related health complication , include Type 2 diabetes , coronary heart disease , hypertension , osteoarthritis . Behavioral weight loss intervention emerge key strategy combat obesity associate health consequence . However , individual differ degree success program even make recommended behavioral change genetic factor know play role . In application , investigator propose identify specific gene predict individual difference weight loss response behavioral intervention help identify individual struggle weight loss despite behavioral effort . Specifically , investigator determine whether obesity gene interact lifestyle intervention predict weight loss year 1 Look AHEAD trial , NIH-funded , multi-center randomize controlled trial primary goal determine whether weight loss achieve intensive lifestyle intervention reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality among person type 2 diabetes . At year 1 , participant assign Intensive Lifestyle Intervention ( ILI ) , focus change diet physical activity , lose average 8.6 % weight ( N = 2,496 ; 97.1 % follow-up ) relative loss 0.7 % among individual assign Diabetes Support Education ( DSE ) group ( N= 2,463 , 95.7 % follow-up ) , receive diabetes support education group alone . Consent genetic analysis provide 3,759 participant . Genotype data IBC chip , genotyping platform include 50,000 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) ~2,600 gene relevant cardiovascular disease , lipid metabolism , diabetes obesity , allow u test central hypothesis gene predispose obesity interact lifestyle treatment influence weight loss follow intensive lifestyle intervention . The investigator also determine whether gene relate high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol predict degree improvement HDL response behavioral intervention . The investigator conduct aim explicit goal bring together team expertise behavioral research , genetic epidemiology molecular biology create transdisciplinary researcher able bridge across discipline identify key gene x behavior interaction context Look AHEAD trial .</detailed_description>
