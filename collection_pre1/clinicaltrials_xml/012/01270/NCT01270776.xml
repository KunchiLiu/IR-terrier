	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare efficacy two different antiseptic solution ( 2 % chlorhexidine 70 % alcohol 2 % aqueous chlorhexidine ) use standardize controlled manner cleanse skin infant birth weight less 1500 gram prior skin break procedure ( venepuncture ) . The investigator hypothesize use limited amount 2 % aqueous chlorhexidine solution effective amount 2 % chlorhexidine 70 % alcohol skin antisepsis limit exposure 2 % aqueous CHG may associate less adverse skin reaction . Literature adult show 2 % chlorhexidine 70 % alcohol well 2 % aqueous chlorhexidine provide effective skin antisepsis though alcohol contain solution long lasting effect . It also well know many case report alcohol contain product use clean abdominal skin neonatal procedure cause severe skin damage preterm infant . This lead many neonatal unit adopt aqueous chlorhexidine antiseptic agent choice without robust evidence support use standardization method application.Both solution widely use neonatal intensive care unit across globe include Canada . By conduct trial , investigator want evaluate efficacy safety 2 % aqueous chlorhexidine antiseptic agent use control manner [ limited amount short duration ] .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Comparing 2 % Chlorhexidine 70 % Isopropyl Alcohol Versus 2 % Aqueous Chlorhexidine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venepuncture , either obtain blood sample laboratory investigation place peripheral intravascular catheter , integral part care neonatal intensive care unit ( NICUs ) . In sick neonate , apart collection blood sample venous cannulation necessary provision total parenteral nutrition administration medication ; however , skin-breaking procedure place risk local systemic infectious complication . Bacterial organism inhabit skin travel insertion site catheter tract colonize catheter tip . This postulated common route infection peripherally inserted catheter , hence need maintain optimal skin antisepsis procedure . It possible completely sterilize skin ; however skin antisepsis aim reduce number viable resident organism skin destroy pathogenic organism may skin . Several antiseptic agent available skin preparation include 70 % alcohol , chlorhexidine ( 70 % alcohol aqueous ) povidone-iodine ( PI ) . Most study compare efficacy agent conduct adult paucity study regard use VLBW infant . Chlorhexidine , one commonly use biocide antiseptic product , broad spectrum bactericidal agent . It diffuse outer cell wall attack bacterial cytoplasmic inner membrane lead cell death . Chlorhexidine active common gram negative gram positive pathogen well yeast . Numerous randomize controlled trial perform adult patient support superiority chlorhexidine skin disinfectant . One influential study conduct Hibbard et al 2002 . The investigator compare 70 % isopropyl alcohol ; 2 % CHG 70 % alcohol ; 2 % aqueous CHG healthy volunteer obtain abdominal inguinal skin swab various time point application . They conclude three solution excellent comparable immediate antimicrobial action 10 minute &amp; 6 hour application 2 % CHG 70 % alcohol well persistent action antisepsis effectiveness 24 hour . To date , study compare 2 % CHG without alcohol directly . Even though mentioned solution prove excellent safety profile adult , significant concern use preterm neonate . The skin newborn infant , especially preterm infant , susceptible damage antiseptic agent . Iodine preparation associate transient suppression thyroid function relate systemic absorption . Alcohol iodine report associate severe skin injury include blistering , burn slough . Systemic absorption chlorhexidine rare , although report occur alcohol use concurrently . These adverse event report solution use placement umbilical line presumably large surface area skin expose great quantity solution long duration . Also procedures solution often get pooled abdominal skin use excessive quantity . No serious adverse event ever report venepuncture ( either form chlorhexidine ) . Such significant concern use iodine alcohol contain solution widespread availability aqueous chlorhexidine lead many NICU 's endorse use without systematically evaluate efficacy population standardization method application . Therefore , important conduct well design study systematically evaluate effectiveness use limited amount 2 % aqueous CHG clinical practice . This double blind plan non-inferiority randomized control trial compare efficacy safety 2 % chlorhexidine 70 % isopropyl alcohol ( current standard practice NICU ) 2 % aqueous chlorhexidine ( investigational agent ) skin antisepsis prior venepuncture low birth weight ( VLBW , birth weight &lt; 1,500 gram ) infant . The effectiveness ( success ) skin antisepsis assess collect pre- post- cleansing skin swab . The skin swab culture microbiology laboratory pre- post- microbial growth compare two group . Changes study protocol : 1 . Results interim analysis : Following pre-planned interim analysis , show initial assumption standard solution clearance rate use sample size calculation ( 92 % ) high rate actually observe dataset collect interim analysis stage investigator ( 84 % ) . With assumption 84 % clearance rate standard solution , study would require big sample size 231 subject arm . With interim data , two group show exactly rate clearance ( 84 % ) wide confidence interval clearance rate estimate due small sample size . Based interim analysis statistically show non-inferiority test solution standard solution . However obtain definitive answer need modify sample size 462 subject ( 231 subject per arm ) . 2 . This multi-center study . We add SickKids , Toronto additional site recruitment . We obtain REB approval SickKids .</detailed_description>
