	<brief_title>Project Wellness : Increasing HIV Testing Among West African Immigrants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Black African immigrant live United States exceptionally high rate HIV AIDS . Sub-Saharan Africa remain epicenter global HIV epidemic , account 22.5 33.3 million people live HIV worldwide . Political , economic , social instability many African country result escalate number Africans migrate United States . The number black African immigrant U.S. grow , increase 166 % 1990 2000 . The 1.4 million document African-born immigrant U.S. 2007 account many undocumented Africans live U.S. Immigrant-related stressor , particularly undocumented migrant , present challenge black Africans healthcare provider seek engage community HIV test treatment . Characteristically long delay access health service accept HIV test result great proportion black Africans present AIDS diagnosis ( 45 % ) , compare U.S.-born non-blacks ( 25 % ) U.S.-born black ( 35 % ) . As U.S. community black Africans continue grow , effort need reduce impact HIV within marginalized community . The lack culturally sensitive voluntary HIV test program discourage early diagnosis treatment African-born immigrant United States . The investigator develop new theory-driven HIV test program build successful history develop HIV test model emergency department ( ED ) , rely partner black African immigrant community address specific cultural , social , practical barrier HIV test faced community . Traditional method HIV test successful test high percentage black Africans U.S. several reason include ( 1 ) reluctance access health care prevention ; ( 2 ) unwillingness disclose information social network , thus render ineffective CDC-recommended social networking strategy reach disaffected population ; ( 3 ) stigma HIV ; ( 4 ) cultural migrant-specific factor pose barrier access health care . The investigator propose partner black African immigrant community member identify cultural migrant-specific factor interfere HIV test , identify characterize African migrant experience regardless country origin , develop video use increase willingness test community test site . The investigator plan develop pilot Project Consensus , use trust community set - pharmacy - establish permanent site HIV test engage large number black Africans ; increase HIV awareness eliminate need rely social network ; reduce stigma place HIV test context general health screening . This proposal base eight year research experience develop test BRIEF , Bronx-based rapid HIV test program ED utilize theory-based risk reduction video user-friendly interactive touch screen computer program . The investigator test 53,000 Bronx resident , high acceptance rate ( 95 % ) adult HIV test high rate ( 85 % ) link HIV+ patient specialize medical care . Project Consensus develop recognition BRIEF eliminate important barrier HIV test black African immigrant , community suffers disproportionately health social consequence HIV . Given increase emphasis within U.S. efficient preventive care , intervention potential provide exemplary method engage member immigrant community earlier stage disease . The study three phase : Phase 1 consist interview focus group obtain community input social cultural barrier test . This input frame content health education video , well creation effective HIV test program . Phase 2 develop HIV test intervention . Phase 3 feasibility trial prepare future randomize controlled trial . An advisory board compose diverse group African community leader inform guide three phase . There three specific aim : 1 . Use individual interview focus group identify specific barrier HIV test assess appropriate method increase participation voluntary HIV testing among black African immigrant ; 2 . Develop theory-based HIV video educate encourage black African immigrant get test ; 3 . Establish feasibility intervention community pharmacy place HIV test general health context , determine : standard deviation primary outcome HIV test rate , use computer-based model ; recruitment black Africans pharmacy . 1 . Determine percentage individual diagnose one three chronic illness link care determine predictor refuse test .</detailed_description>
