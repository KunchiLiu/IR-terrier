	<brief_summary>Screening campaign colorectal cancer ( CRC ) involve two step : detection occult blood stool use Hemoccult GAIAC test ( FOBT ) three consecutive stool sample , follow colonoscopy result positive . The information quality Hemoccult test , however , poor : asymptomatic 50 74 year-old population , detection sensitivity polyps 1 cm diameter order 10 30 % 35 50 % detect colorectal cancer ; specificity 94 98 % complete colonoscopy . The I-FOBTs base immunological detection quantification occult blood stool currently evaluate ; base threshold sensitive FOBT , enhance useless colonoscopy . Alternatively , high threshold blood stool , may become highly specific miss less advanced polyp . Faecal molecular test base detection human DNA anomaly ( point gene mutation , methylation disorder CG islet ) appear sensitive detection occult blood stool loss specificity , expensive , thereby limit generalisation scale population screen . A formal methylated DNA test validate stool well blood cohort symptomatic individual undergone colonoscopy . The aim present study validate test take advantage biotechnical expertise renowned academic research team mass screen organisation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study search validate test take advantage biotechnical expertise renowned academic research team mass screen organisation . In order reduce cost present study investigator select preliminary study individual FOBT . However , 'll measure blood level use I-FOBT test quantify Haemoglobin concentration stool . Furthermore , 'll use stool DNA characterize microbiota accord colonoscopy finding . In addition , investigator believe important include project , creation biological blood urine collection individual undergone faecal test reference colonoscopy . In future , collection make available national international scientific community ( consent principal investigator ) validate molecular and/or protein marker include proteomic analysis use MSS . The investigator perform methylated DNA test either stool blood compare result I-FOBT colonoscopy . A simplified molecular test base combination search methylation anomaly ( one PCR and/or dedicate microarray ) limit number gene target involve colorectal carcinogenesis available . The investigator collect stool , urine , blood period 15 2 day prior colonoscopy . The colonoscopy perform 50-74 year old asymptomatic individual present positive FOBT test mass screen organisation . A final point perform 5 year entry trial 1000 individual order check occurrence ( alternative absence ) disease period type disease individual show normal colonoscopy verify evolution present colon rectal tumor . Likelihood value marker diseases occur survey period calculate prognostic value estimate colon rectal cancer .</detailed_description>
