	<brief_title>Plasmonic Nanophotothermal Therapy Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) one main cause disability death worldwide . The underlying cause generally atherosclerosis particular thrombotic rupture atherosclerotic plaque vital artery . The restoration blood flow ischemic myocardium establish preeminent objective treatment patient CVD . Some modern angioplasty technique generally manipulate form plaque clinical technical restriction , relatively high complication rate restenosis risk . The common technique current practice angioplasty stenting , CABG surgery ( patient multivessel disease ) . Balloon angioplasty stenting fact manage form plaque , create significant problem plaque residue flow site . Once role elective stent implantation establish , next goal overcome complication subacute stent thrombosis ( first , use drug-eluting stent ) neointimal hyperplasia ( bare-metal stent ) pharmacologic physical mean . Among unresolved issue investigator describe restriction patient stenosis unprotected leave main coronary artery , multivessel disease , diabetes mellitus , still rather high rate in-stent restenosis , solution problem foreign body vessel , development biodegradable stent . Among physical obstacle stenting investigator may note atherosclerotic plaque build-up exist number different form . The plaque quite hard scaly , fatty pliable . Moreover , Dr. Peters D. colleague Santa-Barbara ( 2009 ) publish data new modular , multifunctional micelle contain target element , fluorophore , , desire , drug component particle . Targeting atherosclerotic plaque ApoE-KO mouse feed high-fat diet accomplish pentapeptide cysteine-arginine-glutamic acid-lysine-alanine , bind clot plasma protein . The fluorescent micelle bind entire surface plaque , notably , concentrate shoulder plaque , location prone rupture . They also show targeted micelle deliver increase concentration anticoagulant drug hirulog plaque compare untargeted micelle may reduce bleed complication atherogenesis . Moreover , ability statin drug reduce volume atherosclerotic plaque coronary artery wall , term plaque regression , receive much attention . The statin remarkable track record lower cholesterol improve survival . Apart lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level , also multitude action , often collectively describe pleiotropic effect . JUPITER ( 2003 ) , REVERSAL ( 2004 ) , PROVE IT ( 2004 ) , ESTABLISH ( 2004 ) , ASTEROID ( 2006 ) trial show low LDL level intensive statin therapy accompany raise HDL , regress , partially reverse , plaque buildup coronary artery . The finding suggest various component atheroma respond differently treatment medical therapy , use target plaque likely respond . Thus , lipid pool , inflammatory reaction form cellular migration , humoral substance release , edema still likely target pharmacotherapy . But , instance , fibrous tissue , mineral deposit , ground substance would seem irreversible despite metabolic manipulation . Numerous device recently describe utilize application heat resolve atherosclerotic plaque ( laser technique , electrosurgical removing plaque , use radio frequency spark , others ) . Plasmonics novel invasive approach medicine , metal nanoparticles new type optically active composite spherical one consist dielectric core cover thin metallic shell typically gold . When nanoparticles irradiate near-infrared laser , absorb energy , quickly transfer nonradiative relaxation heat accompanied effect , eventually lead irreparable damage tissue . In oncology , metal nanoparticles may provide novel mean target plasmonic photothermal therapy ( PPTT ) tumor tissue , minimize damage surround healthy tissue . However , approach use cardiology today possess great potential angioplasty . The efficiency nanotechnology , however , limited gap current understanding thermal interaction nanoparticles laser light pulse continuous wave context complex biological environment . Irradiation , even moderate pulse energy , induce melting , evaporation , fragmentation nanoparticles . These event drastically alter intend therapeutic effect lead formation vapor bubble well acoustic wave shock wave . But last disadvantage become advantage depend purpose treatment . Thus study open new chapter history plasmonics . The investigator design study check potent clinical opportunity , efficacy safety novel technique angioplasty plasmonic atherodestruction . The investigator draw follow research question : 1 ) Is possible plasmonically entirely destruct plaque minimal complication ? 2 ) What level safety typical different approach compare stenting ? 3 ) What advantage disadvantage different delivery technique - stem cell magnetic field ? 4 ) What mean transplant mesenchymal CD73+CD105+ stem-progenitor cell atherosclerosis management ? 5 ) Can plasmonic nanophotothermal therapy ( PPTT ) get alternative stenting ? Plasmonic photothermal therapy ( PPTT ) potentially reduce volume plaque . PPTT melt atherosclerotic plaque tissue irreparable burning target tissue , vapor bubble cellular cytoplasm extracellular matrix subsequent degradation tissue , destructive effect acoustic shock wave possible plaque-killing mechanism . NPs absolutely safe organism entire kinetics mostly unknown . The dangerous approach low level efficacy safety delivery NPs microbubbles compare stem cell-based one . Mesenchymal stem cell appropriate effectiveness local delivery system lot beneficial property anti-inflammatory , anti-apoptotic , multi-metabolic effect lead plaque degradation . Thus , PPTT become alternative stenting . Among potential problem investigator may name 1 ) technique delivery nanoparticles directly plaque ( stem cell , aleuronic microbubbles surface antibody ( local delivery system ) , direct injection infusion coronary artery plaque CABG PCI ) ; 2 ) high risk acute fatal atherothrombosis heat site due destruction fibrous cap plaque ( role nanoparticles adhesion surface endothelium ) ; 3 ) long-term effect nanodestruction locally entire organism ( distribution effect accumulation different organ ) ; 4 ) mechanism effect ( plasmonic microexplosion burn tissue , lysis cell due vapor bubble cellular cytoplasm extracellular tissue , destructive acoustic shock wave ) ; 5 ) optimal biophysical parameter necessary energy level nanodetonation prevent burning surround tissue perforation vessel ; 6 ) plasmonic damage irreparable , mean investigator combine another biotechnology restoration vessel use stem cell ; 7 ) optimal type stem cell ( source , origin , level differentiation , potential , property ) . So , disadvantage current low-invasive approach ( stenting , statin drug , others , laser , electrosurgery device ) : - Foreign body heart - Restenosis , include neointimal hyperplasia ( adventitial circulate stem-progenitor cell different origin involve ) - Risk fatal acute sub-acute atherothrombosis ( include 'in-stent ' sub-acute atherothrombosis ) - Non-pathogenetic - reverse significantly regress plaque - No effect remodel calcification ( restriction necessary remodeling ) - Clinical restriction group ( multivessel disease , leave main CAD , diabetes mellitus , severe CAD etc ) , another hand , CABG traumatic procedure ( solution - MICS , include achievement endoscopic stereotaxic surgery ) , CABG still approach charge severe high-risk patient Disadvantages study approach : - Necessity special delivery technique - Lost function artery - irreparable pro-fibrotic damage - necessity another clinical management restoration tissue - necessity restoration therapy stem cell - Threat acute fatal atherothrombosis due rupture ( vulnerable ) plaque - Can treat non-organic part plaque - necessity special therapy - stem cell - Harm potent detrimental side-effects - vapor bubbling ( boil cytoplasm ECM subsequent lysis cell , provocation pro-apoptotic cascade ) , acoustic shock wave due plasma-generated laser-related detonation nanoshells tissue - Erratic ( uncontrollable ) heat - surround tissue site interest achieve temperature 38-39° . But site burn final temperature 50-180 C ( cauterization/ searing/ melt effect ) follow pro-fibrous effect tissue .</detailed_description>
