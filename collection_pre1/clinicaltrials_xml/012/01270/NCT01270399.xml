	<brief_summary>Lung cancer remain common cause cancer-related death world . The major advance treatment lung cancer bring minor improvement survival therefore novel systemic treatment method urgently need . Protein level regulate protein homeostasis network generates protect protein fold ( ER Golgi include ) . The heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) essential molecular chaperon involve posttranslational folding stability protein . Hsp90 inhibition lead accumulation unfolded proteins ER stress . The therapeutic efficacy inhibition may augment co-administering drug disrupt ER-Golgi homeostasis like histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) proteasome inhibitor . ER-Golgi homeostasis disruption affect wide network protein pathways affords systemic target . Thus , investigator aim examine effect combine treatment Hsp90 antagonist proteasome HDAC inhibitor human lung cancer cell line primary cell .</brief_summary>
