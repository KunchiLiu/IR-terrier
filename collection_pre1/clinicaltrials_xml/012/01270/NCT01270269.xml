	<brief_summary>Intensive care unit ( ICU ) hospitalization save life often high personal cost ICU survivor frequently experience significant cognitive impairment array physical functional disability limit recovery quality life . While problem experience patient likely amenable rehabilitation , ICU survivor receive focus rehabilitation . Recently , early physical rehabilitation ICU patient show improve chance patient regain pre-hospital functional status . Early cognitive rehabilitation patient yet explore . This pilot study determine feasibility early cognitive rehabilitation ICU patient . The investigator perform cognitive physical rehabilitation , begin early phase critical illness , determine effect therapy cognitive functional outcome ICU survivor . The investigator hypothesize combine cognitive physical rehabilitation , start ICU , improve recovery cognitive physical function well improve quality life ICU survivor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ACT-ICU Study : Activity Cognitive Therapy Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term consequence critical illness intensive care unit ( ICU ) hospitalization ICU survivor profound include cognitive , physical , functional impairment . The purpose study pilot test multi-component , cognitive physical rehabilitation program beginning ICU , combine 12-week home-based cognitive rehabilitation program follow hospital discharge determine whether participation rehabilitation program result improve outcome among ICU survivor . The study rely randomize controlled clinical trial design , patient assign one three group : `` usual care '' control group , early physical activity group ( without cognitive therapy ) , early cognitive therapy physical activity group . All individual intervention group receive protocolized physical therapy hospitalize . In addition , individual early cognitive therapy physical activity group receive cognitive therapy start ICU continue 12 week patient leaf hospital . In-home visit occur every week 12-week intervention period . The study 's primary outcome executive functioning ( e.g . ability plan , organize , multi-task ) 3-months follow hospital discharge measure Tower Test , psychometric tool evaluate executive ability . This chosen due fact available research point presence significant deficit executive function among ICU survivor . Secondary outcome include global cognitive function , physical function Health Related Quality Life assess score follow measure : Katz 's ADL , Functional Activities Questionnaire , AD8 , Short-Informant Questionnaire Cognitive Decline Elderly , Clinical Dementia Rating Scale ( perform ) , Timed Up &amp; Go test , Mini-Mental State Exam , Dysexecutive Questionnaire , Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale , Behavior Rating Inventory Executive Function , Behavior Pain Inventory , Trails A &amp; B test , Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status , General Employment Questionnaire , Beck Depression Inventory II , Post-traumatic stress checklist , Short Form 36 , Canadian Study Health Aging patient weight , Tower Test score 12 month follow-up . We also track readmission hospital admission nursing home skilled rehabilitation facility secondary outcomes 12-month follow-up period . The study duration include 1 year enrollment 1 year study completion follow enrollment final patient .</detailed_description>
