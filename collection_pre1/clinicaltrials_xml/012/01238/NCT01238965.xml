	<brief_summary>Panobinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil leucovorin calcium , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving panobinostat together fluorouracil leucovorin calcium may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose give panobinostat , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium together treat patient stage IV colorectal cancer respond previous fluorouracil-based chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panobinostat Fluorouracil Followed By Leucovorin Calcium Treating Patients With Stage IV Colorectal Cancer Who Did Not Respond Previous Fluorouracil-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety feasibility combine LBH589 infusional 5-FU chemotherapy treatment Stage IV colorectal cancer patient progressed standard 5-FU regimen . II . To determine efficacy LBH589 alone produce consistent decrease tumor thymidylate synthase ( TS ) expression . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time tumor progression , progression free overall survival patient advance metastatic colorectal cancer treat LBH589 combine infusional 5-FU . II . To determine TS repression LBH589 predict response combination LBH589 infusional 5-FU patient already progress standard regimens contain 5-FU . III . To obtain preliminary data gene expression level TS , DPD TP well germline polymorphism TS associate clinical outcome toxicity . IV . To obtain preliminary data acetylation peripheral blood mononuclear cell establish biological activity patient time biopsy . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral panobinostat 3 time week . Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 15 follow fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1-2 15-16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
