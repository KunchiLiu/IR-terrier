	<brief_summary>Bronchiolitis significant cause morbidity hospitalization child , account 125,000 hospitalized child per year United States . Although treatment largely supportive , bronchodilator medication albuterol frequently use due increase pulmonary resistance population.2-4 However , despite four decade clinical trial , efficacy albuterol treatment bronchiolitis yet proven . This inconsistency due part lack sufficiently sensitive method evaluation lung function thus response albuterol infant . Because difficulty evaluate response therapy , healthcare provider force rely physical examination skill clinical scoring system , highly subjective population . The investigator propose conduct prospective observational study healthcare provider determine accuracy clinical assessment compare pulmonary mechanic population child intubate mechanically ventilated bronchiolitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Response Albuterol Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct prospective observational study healthcare provider determine accuracy clinical assessment compare assessment pulmonary mechanic population child intubate mechanically ventilated bronchiolitis . Before 20 minute follow routinely schedule albuterol treatment , measurement pulmonary mechanic obtain part child 's clinical care compare healthcare provider 's simultaneous clinical assessment . Three healthcare provider ( nurse , physician , respiratory therapist ) ass child time period . Data regard observation record use data collection tool ( attach ) . Healthcare providers blind 's assessment measurement pulmonary mechanic . Using sensitivity specificity analysis , healthcare provider 's assessment response compare standard assessment response accord measurement pulmonary mechanic . A precision estimate sensitivity specificity calculate . Clinical characteristic child record . Each child may assess three occasion child receives great 1 dose albuterol . However , 3 provider assess child one time .</detailed_description>
