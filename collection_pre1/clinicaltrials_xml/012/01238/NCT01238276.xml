	<brief_summary>This study focus new drug delivery system ( Direct Antibiotic Delivery ) treat soft tissue infection . In study , cefazolin deliver directly target tissue use subcutaneous injection antibiotic solution disperse use high-frequency external ultrasound . Using system , much high concentration antibiotic achieve traditional treatment method . Unlike traditional delivery method , Direct Antibiotic Delivery rely blood supply beneficial subject Diabetes subject receive radiation therapy blood supply limit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Direct Antibiotic Delivery Cefazolin Into Soft Tissue Infections Using Subcutaneous Injection Ultrasonic Dispersion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , DOSAGE cefazolin deliver fraction already FDA approve intramuscular ( IM ) administration . However , CONCENTRATION target area much high achieve intravenous ( IV ) administration , still far less approved IM administration . Previous study , cefazolin consider ineffective treat Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) test concentration attainable traditional method . Through study laboratory test conduct Harford Hospital , Connecticut , confirm cefazolin effective even resistant strain MRSA high enough concentration obtain . Under study , treatment available subject already undergone standard therapy , able resolve infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects pathologically confirm presence serious immediately lifethreatening soft tissue infection , cellulitis open wound cause bacteria cefazolin concentration likely activity inhibit bacteria , example , Staphylococcus species Streptococcus specie , Escherichia coli , Proteus mirabilis . Wounds must demonstrate presence skin skin structure infection , may demonstrate one following : Culture result aforementioned , swell tissue , discoloration , open wound , and/or drainage , may may associate pain and/or tenderness . Confirmed presence soft tissue cellulitis cause bacteria cefazolin likely activity inhibit bacteria evidence microbiologic culture take great ten ( 10 ) day prior treatment . Subject must previously treat qualify licensed physician use traditional surgical and/or medical treatment , may include course IV antibiotic , Subject unable resolve infection traditional surgical and/or medical treatment soft tissue cellulitis cause bacteria cefazolin likely activity inhibit bacteria maximum concentration 1 gram per 100 ml saline , demonstrate presence induration , redness , open wound , and/or soft tissue swell . Subject must refer treat physician Wound Care Center investigational hospital . The Wound Care Center investigational hospital confirm standard therapy fail cure subject 's infection infection still present . Subjects concomitant antibacterial drug since drug fail treat subject 's infection . Subject may male female must least 18 year age . Subject must sign informed consent approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . Subjects receive treatment traditional surgical and/or medical therapy . Subjects allergic cefazolin . Subjects serious allergy penicillin . Subjects infection involve body cavity . Subjects designate vulnerable , i.e. , pregnant woman , subject age 18 , subject need consent provide Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) . Subjects unable unwilling comply protocol . Subjects history clinically significant uncontrolled cardiac disease , include congestive heart failure , angina , myocardial infarction , arrhythmia , include New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification 3 . Subjects lifethreatening illness organ system dysfunction , , opinion investigator , would either compromise subject safety interfere evaluation safety test drug . Subjects understand English . Subjects receive treatment study eligible readmittance thirty ( 30 ) day date last treatment .</criteria>
