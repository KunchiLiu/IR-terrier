	<brief_summary>This study design two phase : Phase I design confirm surgeon able perform accurate liver surface registration include standard liver feature use landmark schedule laparoscopic liver ablation procedure acquire level comfort procedure . The surface liver manually swab study track laparoscopic probe landmark note data collection . After registration liver obtain , registration point obtain procedure evaluate surgeon move track laparoscopic probe liver surface evaluate location track laparoscopic probe display guidance system three dimensional ( 3D ) image . The surgeon accept reject registration accuracy . The hypothesis surgeon able successfully acquire liver surface registration small learn curve technique able proceed Phase II study . Phase II contain registration process include add additional process track ablation probe use perform tumor ablation attach Pathfinder Multi-Tool adaptor collect data show location ablation probe track displayed Pathfinder three dimensional ( 3D ) image . The surgeon use ultrasound ( US ) guidance locate tumor location laparoscopic procedure . The image collect process record Pathfinder .</brief_summary>
