	<brief_title>Aspirin Mouthwash Treating Patients With Oral Leukoplakia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine oral topical acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash achieves modulation COX-1 , COX-2 , prostaglandin oral dysplasia tissue patient oral leukoplakia . - To determine drug achieves alteration histopathology gene protein expression tissue . - To determine drug achieves aspirin-induced tissue change relate altered tumor biology . - To assess local general tolerability safety drug patient . OUTLINE : All patient undergo tissue biopsy histological diagnosis . Patients without histological diagnosis precancerous oral dysplasia undergo routine follow-up . Patients histological diagnosis precancerous oral dysplasia sequentially allocate 1 4 treatment group . - Group 1 : Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash ( one 75 mg tablet dissolve 250 mL water ) twice daily 4-6 week , gargle 60 second expectorate fully , plan definitive surgical excision . - Group 2 : Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash ( two 75 mg tablet acetylsalicylic acid dissolve 250 mL water ) twice daily 4-6 week , gargle 60 second expectorate fully , plan definitive surgical excision . - Group 3 : Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash ( one 300 mg tablet acetylsalicylic acid dissolve 250 mL water ) twice daily 4-6 week , gargle 60 second expectorate fully , plan definitive surgical excision . - Group 4 : Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash ( one 300 mg tablet acetylsalicylic acid dissolve 250 mL water ) three time daily 4-6 week , gargle 60 second expectorate fully , plan definitive surgical excision . At time definitive surgical excision , patient ask gargle last dose acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash anesthetize . A small biopsy dysplasia lesion take examined immediate effect acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash dysplasia lesion . The surgically excised tissue treat way initial biopsy tissue ( i.e. , half use routine histology confirm diagnosis half research purpose ) . Tissue sample analyze via enzyme immunosorbent assay , qRT-PCR , immunoblotting , ELISA , immunohistochemistry , gene array analysis , microvessel density analysis . Patients complete questionnaire assess local general tolerability well adverse effect period use mouthwash . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .
