	<brief_summary>Despite widespread effort improve treatment obesity , limited progress make . Calorie restriction ( CR ) consistently show produce weight loss , well delay onset age-related disease , numerous specie . Most overweight individual , however , unable sustain CR induce weight loss , possibly due internal feedback system signal body increase food intake decrease energy expenditure response weight loss . Novel treatment approach thus urgently need assist overweight individual adhere CR regimen long-term . Botanicals represent important underexplored source potential new therapy may facilitate CR . In particular , one promise botanical may reduce food intake body weight affect neuroendocrine pathway relate satiety Garcinia Cambogia ( Garcinia Cambogia Desr . ) -derived ( - ) -hydroxycitric acid . This compound find facilitate weight loss number study . To date , study directly test effect botanical food intake human , mechanism action , effect oxidative stress level ; thus rigorous scientific study compound need conduct . A double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study conduct explore role two different dos botanical compound food intake , satiety , weight loss , oxidative stress level . It hypothesize compare placebo , dose Garcinia Cambogia ( hydroxycitric acid ) reduce food intake , increase satiety , decrease weight , reduce oxidative stress level .</brief_summary>
