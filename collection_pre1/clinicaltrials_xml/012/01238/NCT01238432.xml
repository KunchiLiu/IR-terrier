	<brief_summary>Near fatal asthma exacerbation one common cause critical illness child , account approximately ten thousand intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission per year United States . Even child intermittent mild baseline asthma develop severe exacerbation ; however , study evaluate risk factor associate development near fatal asthma exacerbation child . Inhaled β2-adrenergic receptor ( ADRβ2 ) agonist therapy foundation therapy acute asthma genetic variation receptor show affect response ADRβ2 agonist therapy population . The investigator hypothesis child 's ADRβ2 genotype associate development near fatal asthma exacerbation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our primary outcome measure development near fatal asthma exacerbation . Secondary outcome measure include duration continuously nebulized ADRβ2 agonist therapy duration IV ADRβ2 agonist therapy . Children stratify ADRβ2 genotype amino acid position 16 outcome compare . We propose investigate two separate population study : ( 1 ) child admit hospital acute asthma exacerbation , ( 2 ) child asthma never acute near fatal asthma exacerbation . In addition , order replicate finding independent cohort , examine genotype third cohort age-matched child without asthma . For population child admit hospital acute asthma exacerbation , follow inclusion criterion meet : ( 1 ) admission hospital primary admission diagnosis asthma exacerbation ( 2 ) age 4 year 18 year . Near fatal asthma exacerbation define ( 1 ) treatment intubation mechanical ventilation , ( 2 ) presence respiratory acidosis ( arterial pCO2 &gt; 45 ) , ( 3 ) Modified Pulmonary Index Score &gt; 12 2 hour least 20 mg/hour continuously nebulized albuterol therapy . Children exclude ( 1 ) pre-existing chronic disease ( asthma ) include : ( ) bronchopulmonary dysplasia , ( b ) bronchomalacia , ( c ) tracheomalacia , ( ) laryngomalacia , ( e ) vocal cord dysfunction , ( f ) chronic restrictive lung disease , ( g ) recurrent aspiration pneumonia , ( h ) congenital heart disease . For population child asthma never acute near fatal asthma exacerbation , follow inclusion criterion meet : ( 1 ) diagnosis asthma ( 2 ) age 4 year 18 year . Children exclude ( 1 ) child ever require admission hospital near fatal asthma exacerbation ( 2 ) pre-existing chronic disease ( asthma ) list . We propose enroll 158 child , recruit Pulmonary Clinic study institution , match age , gender , NHLBI asthma classification population child near fatal asthma exacerbation . In order replicate finding independent cohort , also examine genetic marker reference group 80 healthy child without asthma , match age , gender race/ethnicity group child near fatal asthma exacerbation . The following inclusion criterion meet group : ( 1 ) age 4 18 year . Children exclude pre-existing chronic disease . This population child recruit Primary Care Clinic CCMC necessary racial/ethnic matching , private practice suburban Hartford . For population child hospitalize asthma exacerbation , patient approach , consent enrol upon admission hospital . In observational study , patient treat accord current asthma treatment protocol effect Connecticut Children 's Medical Center . This protocol previously publish 13 titrates therapy base clinical asthma score ( MPIS ) 51 show highly reproducible group physician , nurse respiratory therapist . This around-the-clock adjustment therapy nurse respiratory therapist produce less variation care due non-medical reason . This protocol include threshold admission/discharge hospital admission/discharge ICU base MPIS . For population child history near fatal asthma exacerbation asthma diagnosis , patient approach , consent enrol upon confirmation eligibility Pulmonary Clinic Primary Care Clinic . Genotyping ADRβ2 gene perform University Connecticut Health Center ( UCHC ) Clinical Translational Research Core Lab . Genotyping perform either saliva whole blood collect routine blood sample clinical care . Children stratify base genotype outcome compare . Providers blind genotype time treatment .</detailed_description>
