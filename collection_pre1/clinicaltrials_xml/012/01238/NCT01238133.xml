	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 give together paclitaxel carboplatin patient stage II stage III triple-negative breast cancer . Gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 together paclitaxel carboplatin surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) RO4929097 ( gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 ) give 3 day , 4 day combination weekly paclitaxel every 3 week carboplatin cause 30 % decrease paclitaxel area plasma-concentration time curve ( AUC ) 0-24hr day 15 compare day -1 patient clinical stage II-III triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure real-time pharmacokinetics RO4929097 administer combination weekly paclitaxel every 3 week carboplatin patient stage II-III TNBC . II . To measure real-time pharmacokinetics paclitaxel administer combination RO4929097 ( 3 day , 4 day ) every 3 week carboplatin patient stage II-III TNBC . III . To evaluate rate pathologic clinical complete response treatment combination RO492097 , paclitaxel , carboplatin patient clinical stage II-III TNBC . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study gamma secretase inhibitor RO4929097 ( RO4929097 ) . Patients receive gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 , paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 ( day -1 course one ) , carboplatin IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 4 week completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo definitive breast surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
