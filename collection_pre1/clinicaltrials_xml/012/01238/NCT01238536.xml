	<brief_summary>The broad , long-term objective research protocol improve quality life patient suffer lumbar spinal stenosis . This objective met examine safety clinical efficacy epidural steroid injection treatment pain associate lumbar spinal stenosis . This prospective , randomize , double-blind control trial ( RCT ) test hypothesis effectiveness epidural steroid injection ( ESI ) plus local anesthetic ( LA ) great epidural injection LA alone old adult lumbar spinal stenosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lumbar spinal stenosis one common cause low back pain elderly lead significant disability . The symptoms spinal stenosis range low back pain neurogenic claudication lower extremity pain , weakness and/or sensory change relate activity . As spinal stenosis affect central canal well lateral recess intervertebral foramen variably , symptom involve single multiple myotomes dermatomes . Since cause spinal stenosis frequently degenerative change , symptom spinal stenosis often , always , worsen time . Despite prevalence spinal stenosis , treatment spinal stenosis remain somewhat controversial . Common treatment include conservative measure non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ( NSAIDS ) , activity modification physical therapy well invasive treatment epidural steroid injection surgery . Although surgery demonstrate provide benefit many individual spinal stenosis , ESI use increase frequency less invasive , potentially cost effective safer treatment spinal stenosis . However , lack data demonstrate effectiveness safety epidural steroid injection spinal stenosis , particularly old adult . Because compel need effective therapy patient suffer spinal stenosis epidural steroid injection rapidly become standard care treat patient - even absence compel clinical evidence - conducting randomize , control trial order test hypothesis lumbar epidural steroid injection improve functional status pain associate spinal stenosis . The main objective study conduct blind , randomize control trial ( RCT ) elderly patient spinal stenosis test effectiveness epidural steroid injection ( ESI ) plus local anesthetic ( LA ) great LA alone .</detailed_description>
