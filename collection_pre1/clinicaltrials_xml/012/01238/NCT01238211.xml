Drugs use chemotherapy , daunorubicin hydrochloride cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Dasatinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving combination chemotherapy together dasatinib may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Dasatinib Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability dasatinib intensive induction therapy ( daunorubicin hydrochloride cytarabine ) , consolidation chemotherapy ( high-dose cytarabine ) , single agent maintenance therapy patient newly diagnose core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical outcome event-free survival ( EFS ) , complete response ( CR ) rate , cumulative incidence relapse ( CIR ) , cumulative incidence death ( CID ) , disease-free survival ( DFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) patient treat regimen . II . To describe frequency severity adverse event patient treat study induction , consolidation , continuation therapy . III . To describe interaction pretreatment disease patient characteristic include morphology , cytogenetics , immunophenotype , molecular genetic feature , white blood cell ( WBC ) count hemogram , performance status clinical outcome . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY ( course 1 ) : Patients receive daunorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) day 1-3 , cytarabine IV continuously 168 hour day 1-7 , dasatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 8-21 . Patients responsive disease day 21 undergo consolidation therapy , patient non-responsive disease day 21 ( bone marrow cellularity &gt; = 20 % leukemia blast &gt; = 5 % ) receive second course induction therapy . INDUCTION THERAPY ( course 2 ) : Patients receive daunorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1-3 , cytarabine IV continuously 120 hour day 1-5 , dasatinib PO day day 6-19 . Patients achieve complete response receive consolidation therapy . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV 3 hour day 1 , 3 , 5 , dasatinib PO QD day 6-26 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete remission receive continuation therapy . CONTINUATION THERAPY : Patients receive dasatinib PO day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month 2 year , every 3 month 2 year , every year 10 year .</detailed_description>
