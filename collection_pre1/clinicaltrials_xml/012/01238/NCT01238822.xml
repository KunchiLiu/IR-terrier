	<brief_summary>Children Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) numerous area neuropsychological dysfunction include response inhibition , work memory , attention . One neuropsychological outcome measure consistently reveal between-group difference response variability . However , recently , difference response variability report ancillary finding view nuisance analysis . The specific aim present study 1 ) Examine response variability ADHD patient across neuropsychological task understand breadth specific deficit understand relation response variability neuropsychological outcome measure ; 2 ) Assess whether response variability deficits specific either two prevalent ADHD subtypes ( i.e. , Combined Type [ CT ] Predominantly Inattentive Type [ PIT ] ) ; 3 ) Determine whether response variability ADHD patient affect either medication variety environmental manipulation ( e.g. , reward ) ; 4 ) Understand relationship neuropsychological measure response variability naturalistic instance variable performance . Forty-five child ( age 7-11 ) ADHD-CT , 45 child ADHD-PIT , 45 normal control recruit examine response variability across wide range neuropsychological test . Task parameter event rate , stimulus saliency , presence operant reward modify test determine condition response variability manifest child ADHD . In addition , child ADHD participate placebo-controlled , randomized medication trial psychostimulant medication ass effect medication response variability . Advanced analytic method utilize non-Gaussian distribution fast Fourier Transforms reaction time data use conduct detailed analysis RT pattern across ADHD normal control group . Further , effect task parametric manipulation medication response variability examine . Finally , relation response variability neuropsychological test response variability variety real-world analog situation examine evaluate ecological validity deficit .</brief_summary>
