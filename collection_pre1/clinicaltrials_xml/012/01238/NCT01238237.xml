	<brief_summary>The high-grade malignant brain tumor , glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , comprise majority primary brain tumor adult . Initial therapy consist either surgical resection , external beam radiation . All patient experience recurrence first-line therapy , improvement first-line salvage therapy critical enhance quality-of-life prolonging survival . It unknown currently use intravenous ( IV ) therapy even cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion ( SIACI ) technique effectively increase concentration drug deliver brain spar body systemic side effect . One currently use drug call , Cetuximab ( Erbitux ) show active human brain tumor actual CNS penetration unknown . This phase I clinical research trial test hypothesis Cetuximab safely use direct intracranial superselective intraarterial infusion dose 500mg/m2 ultimately enhance survival patient relapsed/refractory GBM/AA . By achieve aim study investigator determine toxicity profile maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SIACI Cetuximab . The investigator expect study provide important information regard utility SIACI Cetuximab therapy malignant glioma , may alter way drug deliver investigator patient near future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Super-Selective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion Cetuximab ( Erbitux ) Treatment Relapsed/Refractory GBM AA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There current standard care recur GBM patient receive Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) intravenously ( IV ) 10mg/kg CPT-11 ( Irinotecan ) . At point , patient deem treatment failure give another experimental treatment . Because blood brain barrier ( BBB ) IV drug penetrate blood vessel wall well get brain , one know sure IV drug actually get brain infusion . Previous study show want increase penetration drug brain , intra-carotid artery ( intraarterial ) delivery superior standard intravenous delivery . Previous technique use intraarterial ( intracarotid ) infusion still non-selective drug delivery still go blood vessel brain , patient still significant adverse event , blindness . Newer techniques interventional neuroradiology allow selective delivery catheter higher arterial tree agent chemotherapy , deliver without risk adverse affect blindness . In fact , study Cornell develop new excite super selective intraarterial delivery treatment Retinoblastoma , eye tumor little toxicity clinical trial intraarterial delivery Avastin currently underway GBM . Therefore , trial ask one simple question : Is safe deliver dose Cetuximab intraarterially use super selective delivery technique instead standard intravenous route administration ? This increase amount drug get tumor also spare patient adverse effect less selective delivery . Prior single dose intraarterial Cetuximab , patient also receive dose mannitol open blood brain barrier improve delivery agent brain . After single dose Mannitol Cetuximab intraarterially , patient evaluate 4 week assess toxicity . After point , patient do `` experimental '' aspect protocol . If toxicity point , patient go get choose chemotherapy determine treat oncologist . In summary , Phase I trial design test safety single dose intraarterial delivery Mannitol Cetuximab , prior start patient next round choose chemotherapy To summarize : Current Standard Care Therapy : None Experimental portion proposal : Day 0 : Intraarterial Mannitol open blood brain barrier follow Intraarterial Cetuximab single dose ( start 100mg/m2 500mg/m2 ) Therefore experimental aspect treatment plan include : 1 . Subjects first treat Mannitol prior chemotherapy infusion ( Mannitol 25 % ; 3-10 mL/s 30seconds ) order disrupt blood brain barrier . This technique use several thousand patient previous study IA delivery chemotherapy malignant glioma . 2 . To add single intraarterial delivery ( SIACI ) Cetuximab patient recur relapse high grade glioma . After one cycle observation period ass toxicity IA infusion , subject receive regimen chemotherapy decide treat oncologist The dose escalation algorithm follow : We use single intracranial superselective intraarterial infusion Cetuximab , start dose 100mg/m2 first three patient . Assuming dose limit toxicity next 28 day infusion , patient begin standard chemotherapy regimen determine treat oncologist . The dos escalate 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 finally 500mg/m2 Phase I trial . Both hematologic non-hematologic toxicity IA infusion Cetuximab determine score accord NCI Common Toxicity Criteria ( version 3.0 ) . Monitoring also include MRI brain 4 week post infusion . Most patient GBM also monitor every two month serial history , neurological physical examination together serial blood count , prothrombin time ( PT ) , partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) chemistry . In addition , patient GBM MRI perform every two cycle approximately every two month assess tumor progression . . Since Phase I trial , response primary endpoint trial . However , evaluate response one time IA Cetuximab therapy MRI injection contrast 4 week infusion . Follow-up patient trial regardless chemotherapy regimen try IA Cetuximab therapy continue disease progression death . Survival measure time dose IA CetuximabÂ® . We expect patient trial monitor 12 month . This treatment may harmful fetus . female subject childbearing age , ask practice birth control method participate research study 3 month follow treatment . These method include oral contraceptive , contraceptive shot , barrier method , condom use , sponge , diaphragm . Fertile male require use barrier method . The patient may responsible additional cost associate enrollment trial . All cost IA delivery cost drug submit patient 's insurance provider .</detailed_description>

Patients document histologic diagnosis relapse refractory ( malignant tumor recur resist treatment ) glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma ( AOA ) . Patients must least one confirm evaluable tumor site . A confirmed tumor site one biopsyproven . NOTE : Radiographic procedure ( e.g. , Gdenhanced MRI CT scan ) document exist lesion must perform within three week treatment research study . Patients must Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % ( equivalent ECOG level 02 ) ( see Appendix A ; Performance Status Evaluation ) expect survival great equal three month . No chemotherapy two week prior treatment research protocol external beam radiation two week prior treatment research protocol . Patients must adequate hematologic reserve WBC great equal 3000/mm3 , absolute neutrophil great equal 1500/mm3 platelet great equal 100,000/ mm3 . Patients Coumadin must platelet count great equal 150,000/ mm3 Preenrollment chemistry parameter must show : bilirubin le 1.5X institutional upper limit normal ( IUNL ) ; AST ALT le 2.5X IUNL creatinine le 1.5X IUNL . Preenrollment coagulation parameter ( PT PTT ) must equal less 1.5X IUNL . Concomitant Medications Steroids Systemic corticosteroid therapy permissible patient CNS tumor treatment increase intracranial pressure symptomatic tumor edema . Patients CNS tumor receive dexamethasone must stable decrease dose least 1 week prior study entry . We believe study procedure place subject increase intracranial pressure additional risk .
