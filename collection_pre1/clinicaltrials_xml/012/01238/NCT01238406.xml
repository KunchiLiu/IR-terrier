	<brief_summary>Study design : Multicenter , randomize , prospective , open label , cross , six segment , pilot trial evaluate blood glucose control overnight closed-loop insulin delivery MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas ( MDLAP ) system patient type 1 diabetes . first segment 15 eligible subject enrol three participate center ( 5 patient center ) . All 15 patient participate overnight close loop session hospital setting . On second segment , 54 eligible subject enrol ( 18 center ) . Each subject participate two consecutive overnight session diabetes camp setting , one closed-loop MDLAP one sensor augment pump therapy . In third segment,9-20 eligible patient enrol Israeli center only.Each subject participate four consecutive overnight close loop MDLAP four additional overnight regular sensor augment pump therapy home . On fourth segment , 45-60 patient enrol Israeli center . This segment conduct diabetes camp consist two main part . In part 1 , 15-20 patient randomize participate one two group : 2-4 night close loop control MD-Logic learning algorithm activate 2-4 night close loop control without activate MD-Logic learning algorithm . In part 2 forth segment 30-40 patient participate two consecutive24-48 hour session , one close loop control second sensor augment pump therapy . On fifth segment 40-80 eligible patient enrol Israeli center only.The first 10 patient participate pilot session data gather pilot session use final analysis.This segment consist two part . At part 1 subject participate 4weeks-1.5 month period night either use closed-loop MDLAP use sensor augment pump ( SAP ) therapy.At end first 4 weeks-1.5 month study , statistical analysis perform order decide whether extend study optional period extra 4 weeks-1.5 months.In case decide extend study , additional 4 weeks-1.5 month intervention period follow completion final visit activity offer participant . Subjects participate control group ( sensor augment pump therapy ) offer opportunity continue 4 weeks-1.5 month closed-loop control study group offer switch sensor augment pump therapy . In segment 5 part 2 , 40 patient enrol . Each patient participate 3 month study period either use overnight close loop MDLAP sensor augment pump therapy.Participants segment 5 part 2 offer participate part 2A . At part , sleep quality assessment make ( use actigraf sleep questionnaire ) At end period optional 3 month extension period offer arm ( cross-over ) Segment 6 consist two main parts.In part 1 , 40 eligible patient enrol Israeli center . Each subject participate 72 hour closed-loop MDLAP home 72 hour regular sensor augment pump therapy . The sequence treatment intervention randomly assign . The sequence treatment intervention randomly assign . In part 2 segment 40 eligible patient enrol Israeli center . Each subject participate 2 week close loop MDLAP home 2 week regular sensor augment pump therapy . The sequence treatment intervention randomly assign Objectives : The objective feasibility study evaluate safety efficacy blood glucose control use MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas System individual type 1 diabetes hospital setting , diabetes camp finally patient 's home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In last two decade , remarkable technological progress make development continuous glucose sensor , miniature device , implantable pump sensor wireless communication , interest closed-loop insulin delivery revive . Control trail evaluate clinical benefit continuous glucose sensor show improved HbA1c significant increase sever hypoglycemia , trend towards low hypoglycemic episode although significant significant change sever hypoglycemia . One main drawback continuous glucose sensor noncompliant patient , flow information need act accordingly make devise burden patient . Theoretically subcutaneous insulin pump glucose sensor attach artificial pancreas closed-loop system mimic activity function pancreatic beta cell , strict control blood glucose level . Such system may also offer opportunity free patient daily burden deal diabetes . We develop MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas ( MDLAP ) base model imitate logic diabetes care giver . We aim evaluate blood glucose control overnight closed- loop insulin delivery MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas ( MDLAP ) system patient type 1 diabetes hospital setting , diabetes camp setting finally patient 's home . Study Objectives To determine safety efficacy use MDLAP system automatically control blood glucose type 1 diabetic patient . Study Scope This three center , prospective pilot trail evaluate blood glucose control closed-loop insulin delivery MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas ( MDLAP ) system patient type 1 diabetes , conduct : Tel Aviv , Israel ; Ljubljana , Slovenia Hannover , Germany Study consist six segment : In segment 1 , 15 eligible patient enrol pilot study . 5 patient recruit center.Data generate first patient center include final statistical analysis use assess logistical training issue . On second segment , 54 eligible subject enrol ( 18 center ) . Each subject participate two consecutive overnight session diabetes camp setting , one closed-loop MDLAP one sensor augment pump therapy . Staying camp , represent home setting , site support medical team train diabetes . A remote safety control diabetes management system utilized segment enable supervise personnel alert patient intervene case impend hypoglycemia , long stand hyperglycemia technical fault component AP system . In third segment,9-20 eligible patient enrol Israeli center only.Each subject participate four consecutive overnight close loop MDLAP four additional overnight regular sensor augment pump therapy home.In similar segment 2 , use also segment 3 remote safety control diabetes management system enable supervise personnel alert patient parent intervene case impend hypoglycemia , long stand hyperglycemia technical fault component AP system . On fourth segment , 45-60 patient enrol Israeli center , This segment conduct diabetes camp consist two main part . In part 1 , 15-20 patient randomize participate one two group : 2-4 night close loop control MD-Logic learning algorithm activate 2-4 night close loop control without activate MD-Logic learning algorithm . In part 2 forth segment 30-40 patient participate two consecutive 24-48 hour session , one close loop control second sensor augment pump therapy . On fifth segment 40-80 eligible patient enrol Israeli center conduct patient 's home . This segment consist two main part .The first 10 patient participate pilot session data gather pilot session use final analysis . At part 1 subject participate 4 weeks-1.5 month period night either use closed-loop MDLAP use sensor augment pump ( SAP ) therapy.At end first 4 weeks-1.5 month study , statistical analysis perform order decide whether extend study optional period extra 4 weeks-1.5 months.In case decide extend study , additional 4 weeks-1.5 month intervention period follow completion final visit activity offer participant . Subjects participate control group ( sensor augment pump therapy ) offer opportunity continue 4 weeks-1.5 month closed-loop control study group offer switch sensor augment pump therapy . In segment 5 part 2 , 40 patient enrol . Each patient participate 3 month study period either use overnight close loop MDLAP sensor augment pump therapy . Participants segment 5 part 2 offer participate part 2A . At part , sleep quality assessment make ( use actigraf sleep questionnaire ) . At end period optional 3 month extension period offer arm ( cross-over ) . Segment 6 consist two main parts.In part 1 40 eligible patient enrol Israeli center . Each subject participate 72 hour closed-loop MDLAP home 72 hour regular sensor augment pump therapy . The sequence treatment intervention randomly assign . In part 2 segment 40 eligible patient enrol Israeli center . Each subject participate 2 week close loop MDLAP home 2 week regular sensor augment pump therapy . The sequence treatment intervention randomly assign</detailed_description>
