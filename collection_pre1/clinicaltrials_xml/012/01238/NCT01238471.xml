	<brief_title>Oral Propranolol Versus Placebo Early Stages Retinopathy Prematurity : A Randomized Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) affect retinal microvasculature , mostly very-low-birth-weight ( VLBW : &lt; 1500g ) premature infant , significant complication extreme prematurity lead sometimes devastating consequence . Although ROP usually mild harm , happen rarely aggressive cause neo-vascularization ( NV ) immature retina time progress severe fibrovascular proliferation , retinal detachment blindness ( 1 ) . Major risk factor ROP low gestational age , low birth weight , hyperoxia , respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) ( 2 ) well postnatal steroid therapy ( 3 ) . Of note one report show use beta-blocking agent mother birth find associate development ROP ( 4 ) . However , far one report similar effect postnatal use beta blocker ROP . The incidence ROP inversely relate gestational age ( GA ) birth weight ( BW ) . The condition develop 51 % infant birth weight ( BW ) &lt; 1700 g ( 5 ) . In infant weigh less 1250 g , 50 % show evidence ROP 10 % progress stage III ROP . According Israeli VLBW-Database 2007 , 23.9 % infant develop ROP ( stage ) , 4.8 % develop severe ROP ( stage III-IV ) ( 4 ) . Worldwide , least 50,000 child blind ROP ( 2,7 ) . In South Africa account 10.6 % case childhood blindness ( 8 ) . In US , annually , 500-700 child become blind due ROP , 2100 infant affect cicatricial sequela , myopia , strabismus , well late-onset retinal detachment ( 1 ) . LASER photocoagulation ischemic retina therapy choice moderate severe ROP require 19.8 % , 7.7 % . 1.5 % 0.6 % infant weigh 500-749g , 750-999g , 1000-1249g , 1250-1499g , respectively ( 2 ) . In Israel , 4 % VLBW infant need LASER photocoagulation cryo therapy 2007 ( 6 ) . The pathogenesis ROP multifactorial two pathogenetic theory propose : ( A ) One-phase theory : Mesenchymal spindle cell expose extrauterine hyperoxia , develop gap junction interfere normal vascular formation trigger neovascular response ( 9 ) . ( B ) Two-phase theory : The first phase ( hyperoxic phase , vaso-obliterative ) , consist retinal vasoconstriction irreversible capillary endothelial cell damage . As retinal area supply affected vessel become ischemic , angiogenic factor , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) produce mesenchymal spindle cell ischemic retina provide neo vascularization ( NV ) channel ( second phase , vaso-proliferative ) ( 10 ) . Increasing evidence support key role VEGF pathogenesis ROP , wherein VEGF down-regulated vaso-obliterative first phase up-regulated vaso-proliferative second phase ( 11 ) . Numerous study perform animal model oxygen-induced retinopathy ( OIR ) , wherein newborn rat , mouse , kitten beagle puppy expose 75-100 % O2 5 day start day 7 life ( 11 ) . ROP usually develop 100 % O2-exposed rat ( 12 ) . The expression various angiogenetic inflammation gene study oxygen-induced retinopathy ( OIR ) . Sato et al ( 13 ) investigate expression 94 gene OIR use microarray analysis reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . They observe : ( ) Inflammation gene up-regulated day 12-13 life degree central avascular area central vasoconstriction maximal ; up-regulation continue day 21 life ; ( b ) Extra retinal vascularization noticeable day 16-17 life , angiogenesis gene ( VEGF-A , angiopoietin-2 ) high expression . There also increase evidence up-regulation VEGF sympathomimetic agent . In regard , norepinephrine show stimulate myocardial angiogenesis rat ( 14 ) . In cultured retinal endothelial cell , Steinle et al ( 15 ) show significantly increase expression beta-3 receptor could promote migration proliferation ( two marker angiogenic phenotype ) retinal endothelial cell . In addition , cancer cell culture , catecholamine ( norepinephrine epinephrine ) induce increase VEGF expression tissue culture nasopharyngeal carcinoma , effect block propranolol ( prop ) ( non-selective beta blocker ) ( 16 ) . Evidence exist norepinephrine-induced invasiveness increase VEGF human pancreatic cell line , could also block prop ( 17 ) . Blockade effect prop raise prospect possible chemo-prevention vascularization-rich tumor propranolol . Recent study show administration beta-blockers ( locally systemic ) mitigate NV , probably regulation VEGF . In animal model OIR , topical timolol ( beta blocker ) prevent development OIR 40 % rat mitigate severity OIR remain 60 % rat develop OIR ( 12,18 ) . In addition , timolol protective effect , whereby NV occur 65 % timolol-treated compare 100 % NV untreated rat ( 19 ) . Furthermore , VEGF expression lower timolol-treated rat control ( room air ) . In contrast , Zheng et al ( 20 ) find effect prop VEGF protein messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression retina diabetic rat retinopathy . ROP infantile hemangioma ( rather common phenomena premature infant ) supposedly share pathogenetic role angiogenic factor VEGF ( 21 ) . In recent report Praveen et al ( 22 ) , possible association ROP infantile hemangioma discharge study premature infant weigh &lt; 1250 g. Infantile hemangioma find independently associate stage ROP : infantile hemangioma present 16.8 % neonate ROP compare 6.7 % without ROP . However , neither size number infantile hemangioma show association severity ROP . The above-mentioned publish finding point VEGF-mediated pathogenesis ROP infantile hemangioma , wherein VEGF expression reportedly up-regulated sympathomimetic agent block beta blocker . Furthermore , clinical scene , usefulness prop mitigate progression infantile hemangioma recently report ( 23-32 ) . Infants severe life-threatening hemangioma successfully treat prop , adverse effect . One potential explanation effect prop hemangioma include : ( ) vasoconstriction , ( b ) decrease expression VEGF basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) gene down-regulation RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway ( 33 ) ( explain progressive improvement hemangioma ) , ( c ) trigger capillary endothelial cell apoptosis ( 34 ) . Prop administration observe safe infant toddler ( 23-32 , 35 ) . Love et al ( 35 ) find 40 year clinical use infant toddler , document case death serious cardiovascular disease direct result exposure beta-blockers . Furthermore , prop also report safe give premature infant treatment neonatal thyrotoxicosis , neonatal arrhythmia life-threatening hemangioma ( 32 , 36-39 ) . In five extreme-low-birth weight infant ( weight &lt; 1000 g ) , use prop neonatal thyrotoxicosis beneficial adverse effect ( 36 ) . The safety prop use also report 34-week infant ( 37 ) 37-week infant ( 38 ) thyrotoxicosis , also 35-week infant neonatal arrhythmia ( 39 ) . Furthermore , 28-week premature infant treat for18 week prop thoracic hemangioma without untoward effect ( 32 ) .</detailed_description>
