	<brief_summary>Monogenic diabetes unusual form diabetes . It usually present patient age 30 , often misdiagnosed Type 1 diabetes common . Patients monogenic diabetes often treat tablet rather insulin injection , lead good control diabetes , few side-effects complication . Less 5 % people monogenic diabetes UK identify , mean 20,000 patient may still misdiagnosed receive inappropriate treatment . We want identify best way ensure people diagnose diabetes age 30 necessary test ensure correct treatment particular type diabetes . A small number people may , part study , find specific genetic cause diabetes case measure success benefit change treatment , usually insulin injection sulphonylurea tablet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim : The aim project identify patient pathway ensure patient young-onset diabetes ( diagnose &lt; 30 year ) systematic series investigation allow appropriate genetic test hence appropriate alteration therapy require . Objectives : 1 . To establish test care pathway detect monogenic diabetes patient diabetes diagnose age 30 year currently age 50 year . This indicate prevalence monogenic diabetes . 2 . To measure success , cost potential economic benefit change treatment patient identify monogenic diabetes initial therapy , typically insulin injection , appropriate treatment , usually oral sulphonylureas . 3 . To obtain necessary data enable development appropriate health economic model . This project provide evidence cost-based model systematic care pathway diagnosis treatment diabetes diagnose &lt; 30 year . The pathway select subject clinical , biochemical ( urinary C peptide ) immunological ( pancreatic autoantibody ) criteria genetic testing . The present approach relies clinicians recognise possibility monogenic cause arrange genetic testing . In UK le 5 % estimate case monogenic diabetes identify mean 20,000 diabetic patient receive inappropriate treatment . Patients confirm molecular genetic test monogenic diabetes may benefit change insulin therapy , treatment sulphonylurea tablet diet alone . Systematic target use molecular genetic test young-onset diabetes result stratify treatment accord aetiology improve efficacy , quality life long term complication risk , reduce side effect cost . This project aim develop pathway test patient diagnose age 30 year , identify receive genetic testing . This consist three stage : 1 ) urine test determine patient make insulin ; 2 ) make insulin , blood test carry test antibody see Type 1 diabetes ; 3 ) negative antibody , genetic test carry determine whether monogenic diabetes . Individuals find monogenic diabetes may treatment change . Project Plan This project base Exeter undertaken collaboration colleague Ninewells Hospital Trust University Dundee Scotland . Within define geographical region Tayside Devon , patient diabetes diagnose 30 year age , currently age less 50 year , invite participate study . We estimate total population 800,000 ( 400,000 Devon 400,000 Tayside ) potential group 3,000 patient identify , approximately 90 % ( n=2700 ) likely insulin treat . Initial procedure follow recruitment : Participants provide write patient information sheet , consent form , urine sample container write instruction sample collection . Baseline data collect either face face telephone member research team . Participants ask provide single urine sample 2 hour main meal day . Baseline data subject include age , age diagnosis , duration diabetes , height , weight , initial/current treatment , family history diabetes . Permission access medical record obtain order clarify confirm relevant clinical data . The participant ask return complete consent form urine sample research team routine NHS courier service sample return local GPs . In Tayside , patient clinical diagnosis Type 1 diabetes , age 16 year old , initially recruit Scottish Diabetes Research Network Type 1 Diabetes Bioresource ( Ethics ref : 10/S140243 ) . Those diagnosed 30 year age , currently age less 50 year old , ask return post-meal urine sample research team proceed UNITED study participant . Following initial urine test , participant find UCPCR negative inform result via standardised letter . This complete involvement project . Participants find UCPCR positive informed result member research team give opportunity discus implication next stage project . 1 . UCPCR positive patient : Participants invite Peninsula Clinical Research Facility ( PCRF ) , Ninewells Clinical Research Centre ( NCRC ) , suitable local venue blood sample pancreatic auto-antibodies ( GAD IA2 ) , DNA extraction HbA1c take member research team . Following initial antibody screen participant find antibody positive inform result via standardise letter ( Stage2/GADpos/Vs1/0810 ) . This complete involvement project . Those participant find antibody negative inform result person member research team give opportunity discus implication next stage project . 2 . UCPCR positive Antibody negative patient : Participants know UCPCR positive antibody negative offer genetic screening monogenic diabetes . Information provide research team , train genetic counselling , implication genetic test possible consequence positive negative result individual case positive result implication family member . Those participant find negative following genetic screening inform result member research team . This follow standardised letter ( Stage2/neg-gen-test/Vs1/0810 ) complete involvement project . Those participant positive result follow genetic screening inform result person member research team , give opportunity discus implication next stage project . 3 . The participant subsequent stage project define : - UCPCR positive - antibody negative - confirm diagnosis monogenic diabetes follow molecular genetic testing . It anticipate participant may require review revision current treatment . This review NHS Clinician manage participant 's diabetes . They inform NHS Clinical expert monogenic diabetes . Transfer patient identify monogenic diabetes alternative treatment Following review , participant appropriate treatment transfer sulphonylureas HNF1A/HNF4A treatment GCK mutation . As subject identify go screen program , order increase number part project enable accurate assessment potential cost benefit transfer , also recruit patient assessment include patient monogenic diabetes diagnose outside project . At present diagnostic lab identify approximately 10 new UK patient per month . Referring Clinicians send write information project via standardised letter ( MODY refer Clinician cover letter - Vs1/0810 ) accompany test result . Participants identify route allow u recruit additional patient ensure sufficient data achieve good confidence limit estimate require future development health economic model . The assessment success treatment transfer glycaemic control quality life : Participants ask fill baseline standardise questionnaire ( ADDQoL , EQ5D DTSQs ) ass patient report outcome include : impact diabetes quality life , current health status treatment satisfaction current treatment . Child participant ask fill age appropriate version study questionnaire : ADDQoL-Teen , ( teenager 16 year ) , ADDQoL-Junior ( 5-8 year old ) , ADDQoL- Junior Plus ( 9-12 year old ) , EQ-5D youth/children ( age 7-12 year ) , DTSQ-Teen ( teenager 16 year age ) . Where appropriate parental responsibility ask provide information complete DTSQ-Parent . Following treatment change , participant follow diabetes specialist research nurse often participant require order assess treatment need , provide emotional support . This may initially daily first week , tail gradually individual becomes confident new treatment blood glucose level stablise . The timing dependent individual need . Post treatment questionnaire follow : 1 month - repeat DTSQs EQ5D 6 month - repeat DTSQs EQ5D ADDQoL 12 month repeat DTSQs follow DTSQc , EQ5D ADDQoL . Blood sample HbA1C take 3 , 6 12 month . Participant involvement study complete 12 month follow initial treatment change . During 12 month period clinical care participant remain responsibility NHS clinician . These clinician inform NHS expert monogenic diabetes . Development Heath Economic model prototype A health economic model develop compare likely cost effect new care pathway current practice . This informed systematic review current relevant economic literature build exist economic model diabetes . It also inform result project . Funding : This study fund grant Health Innovation Challenge Fund ( HICF ) joint venture Department Health Wellcome Trust . Project funding administer University Exeter . A collaboration agreement University Exeter University Dundee establish determine distribution fund two organisation .</detailed_description>
