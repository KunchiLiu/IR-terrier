	<brief_title>Diet Altering Disease Progression Patients With Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CALGB 70807 randomize , phase III clinical trial design test practical , diet-based intervention prostate cancer broad clinical setting . Patients AS randomized either intervention centralize , telephone-based dietary counseling structure dietary education comparison control condition receive Prostate Cancer Foundation booklet . Study endpoint include disease progression , incidence treatment , health-related quality life . OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine telephone-based dietary intervention compare intervention decrease clinical progression AS patient . Secondary - To compare incidence active treatment ( surgery , irradiation , local ablation , androgen deprivation ) AS patient receive dietary intervention compare intervention . - To compare prostate cancer-related anxiety AS patient receive dietary intervention compare intervention . - To compare health-related quality life AS patient receive dietary intervention compare intervention . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord age ( ≤ 70 year vs &gt; 70 year ) , race ( black african american v ) , baseline prostate biopsy ( 0-12 month registration v &gt; 12-24 month registration ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Please see arms section information .</detailed_description>
