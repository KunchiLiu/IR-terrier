	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Oral Panobinostat ( LBH589 ) Rituximab Treat Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized Phase II , multi-center study LBH589 give alone ( Arm A ) combination rituximab ( Arm B ) . The objective study : - To investigate efficacy LBH589 alone addition rituximab patient relapse refractory DLBCL . - To investigate safety tolerability single agent LBH589 therapy combination therapy LBH589 rituximab . - To identify potential biological factor might correlate efficacy . LBH589 give dose 30mg orally every Monday , Wednesday Friday , study agent . Rituximab give single 375mg/m2 dose intravenously day 1 cycle . Treatment may administer 6 cycle . Treatment beyond 6 cycle discuss Sponsor . Each cycle last 21 day . A Phase I , dose-escalation component study , determine recommend phase II dose rituximab combination LBH589 , consider necessary respective toxicity profile two drug predict overlap toxicity . Dose de-escalation LBH589 perform toxicity . No dose escalation permit . If patient experience grade 2 toxicity return grade &lt; 1 within 4 week stop therapy , allow continue therapy . If two dose interruption require toxicity , also reason remove study . An interim analysis safety futility perform total 10 patient arm enrol .</detailed_description>
