	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose sunitinib malate give together bevacizumab treat patient kidney cancer advance solid malignancy . Sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving sunitinib malate together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer Advanced Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability sequential sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) bevacizumab patient clear cell kidney cancer . II . To assess objective response rate sequential sunitinib bevacizumab patient clear cell kidney cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacodynamic change standardize uptake value ( SUV ) peak tumor perfusion use fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine positron emission tomography ( FLT-PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) scan baseline , sunitinib exposure , bevacizumab exposure ( sunitinib withdrawal period ) patient renal cell solid malignancy . II . To characterize change ratio free : bound plasma vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) patient treat sequential sunitinib bevacizumab . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study sunitinib malate . Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) day 1-28 bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 29 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
