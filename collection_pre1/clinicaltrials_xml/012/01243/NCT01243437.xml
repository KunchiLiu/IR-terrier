	<brief_summary>Plague severe , life-threatening disease . Plague occur focal location worldwide , 95 % human case report WHO country Africa . The common clinical manifestation human infection bubonic , septicemic , pneumonic plague . Untreated pneumonic septicemic plague fatal 90 % case ; untreated bubonic plague fatal 50 % case . Delayed ineffectual treatment main contributor elevate case fatality rate , high 40 % , development pneumonic plague plague outbreak . Streptomycin consider treatment choice , prompt administration reduce mortality 5 % less . However , streptomycin may cause irreversible hearing loss vestibular damage , reversible renal damage , contraindicated pregnancy . Tetracyclines , include doxycycline , consider effective alternative bacteriostatic relatively contraindicate use child age &lt; 8 year pregnant woman . Ciprofloxacin relatively newer antimicrobial use extensively clinical practice broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity , excellent tissue intracellular penetration , suitability oral administration , good overall tolerability . In vitro animal study suggest equivalent great activity ciprofloxacin Yersinia pestis compare streptomycin tetracycline . However , efficacy ciprofloxacin treatment human plague never demonstrate , FDA approve indication . Since 2004 , CDC collaborate Uganda Ministry Health ( MoH ) Uganda Virus Research Institute ( UVRI ) enhance surveillance , diagnosis , ecological control plague Arua Nebbi Districts . Through effort , collect data 2,400 case clinically diagnose plague occur 1999 2009 . In 2008 , UVRI CDC staff investigate 163 suspect plague case : 57 ( 35 % ) laboratory-confirmed plague illness , 14 patient ( 25 % ) die . Because plague relatively rare disease mainly affect people live rural , impoverished area , receives limit attention research development affordable sustainable diagnostic treatment option . However , plague eradicate , cause high case fatality potential widespread person person transmission , continue research neglect . The objective clinical trial conduct randomize , open-labeled , non-inferiority study compare safety efficacy ciprofloxacin doxycycline , national treatment standard Uganda plague , patient age &gt; 8 year . The primary outcome trial patient outcome 14 day enrollment initiation treatment . Patient outcome evaluate patient laboratory-confirmed plague illness . Information gather propose study help optimize management naturally occur plague human many country world , include Uganda United States , provide clinician choice optimal antimicrobial treatment . This particularly true resource limit rural region Uganda intravenous intramuscular injection less available . Ciprofloxacin currently use Uganda plague endemic area world treatment infectious condition , include infectious diarrhea low respiratory infection . In Uganda , ciprofloxacin widely available health facility local drug shop , affordable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Evaluate Safety Efficacy Ciprofloxacin Treatment Plague Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plague life-threatening disease require immediate treatment effective antimicrobial . Drugs demonstrate efficacy include streptomycin , doxycycline , less extent , gentamicin . Animal vitro study suggest fluoroquinolones , include ciprofloxacin , may effective agent treatment plague . However , exception single case report , publish instance fluoroquinolones use successfully treat plague human . There critical need evaluate new antimicrobial show efficacious vitro animal study , use extensively treatment illness human , work separate mechanism antimicrobial currently use treatment , widely available affordable . The objective study conduct randomize , open-labeled , non-inferiority study compare safety efficacy ciprofloxacin doxycycline , national treatment standard Uganda . This study design test follow hypothesis : safety efficacy ciprofloxacin treatment plague human inferior doxycycline . This study result well understanding safety efficacy ciprofloxacin treatment plague human . Information study use expand experience knowledge base treatment plague human guide national international treatment guideline . Information study also possibly add antiquated list effective antimicrobial use treat plague possibly lead reduction overall morbidity mortality cause plague treatment . The randomized clinical trial provide best design distinguish treatment effect effect bias allocation , observation , measurement ; spontaneous change disease course healing ; improvement participate study ( i.e. , placebo effect ) . An open-labeled design use opportunity investigator patient bias outcome limit ( i.e. , patient randomize enrollment mortality objective outcome ) double blind design would greatly increase complexity cost trial . The primary outcome trial patient outcome 14 day enrollment initiation treatment , include outcome patient recovery without complication , recovery complication , withdrawal , death . Patient outcome evaluate patient laboratory-confirmed plague illness . Time defervesence occurrence antimicrobial-associated adverse event evaluate secondary outcome patient laboratory-confirmed plague illness enrol patient , respectively . When conduct non-inferiority study , important consider appropriate selection comparator treatment , non-inferiority margin ( M ) , analysis strategy . For non-inferiority trial , critical select standard treatment proven best historically use prior randomized clinical trial comparator treatment . Of possible option , doxycycline optimal choice trial current treatment standard Uganda ( country location propose study ) treatment regimen side effect profile similar ciprofloxacin . For trial , non-inferiority margin ( M ) acceptable difference probability ciprofloxacin cure plague compare probability doxycycline cure plague . Because severity illness high case fatality rate plague general , potential pneumonic transmission pneumonic plague , choice acceptable M 10 % conservative choice 2 % . If assume overall Type I error rate = 0.05 , power ( power = 1 - Type II error rate ) 80 % , πs = 0.90 choose M = 0.10 , number patient require study arm well 1,000 ( calculation show ) . From previous experience similar trial ( i.e. , The safety efficacy gentamicin vs. streptomycin treatment plague human , CDC IRB # 3700 ) current experience surveillance data Uganda , anticipate able enroll approximately 100-200 total patient per year . Therefore , compute power use different value M ( 0.02 , 0.05 , 0.10 ; 0.02 conservative 0.10 forgiving still within accepted non-inferiority margin ) , represent range report efficacy standard ( table show ) . Using table , would approximately 61 % power detect non-inferiority ciprofloxacin treatment non-inferiority margin , M , = 0.10 true efficacy standard = 90 % enroll 148 patient total , example . This study attempt include suspect case plague age 8 year old identify clinic-based surveillance . Most patient , include plague case , treat `` level 3 '' health center , mainly due lack motorize transport . Between 3 10 `` level 3 '' clinic Arua Nebbi Districts , Uganda choose participate study base report number case plague last 5 year logistic consideration . Only UMOH clinic consider inclusion . The `` level 3 '' clinic staff 1-2 clinical officer busy , see 50-150 patient day . Because excess patient volume , study collaborator hire train one additional clinical officer collaborate clinic work alongside UMOH clinical officer ( ) station collaborate clinic impair normal clinic function . The hired clinical officer train clinical aspect plague study protocol , responsible evaluate suspect plague patient study enrollment , consent patient , provide patient treatment monitoring per study protocol . The diagnosis suspect plague patient consent enroll study follow national guideline UMOH . The adaptation , receive informed consent , UMOH physicians collect biologic sample patient randomize receive ciprofloxacin doxycycline . Of note , urine pregnancy test conduct every female child-bearing age time enrollment randomization antimicrobial treatment initiate unless result negative . Based experience conduct similar trial Madagascar , result urine pregnancy test available le 5 minute cause substantial time delay . Antimicrobial treatment per UMOH national guideline start immediately instance delay obtain consent collect biologic sample , treat physician deems necessary . Suspect case plague eligible ask give consent study enrollment use follow criterion : 1. person , include woman person minority , ; 2. must age 8 year old , ; 3. must potential exposure rodent and/or fleas contact confirm plague case , ; 4. must fever least 38ºC develop rapidly , least one following : 1 . One bubo , define tender lymph node swell &gt; 1cm diameter , ; 2 . Clinical suspicion pneumonic plague ( e.g . prostration , cough , increase respiratory rate , hemoptysis and/or purulent sputum ) , 3 . Clinical suspicion cutaneous plague ( lesion ) 4 . Clinical suspicion plague epidemiologic link case . Patients suspect plague illness consider ineligible study exclude study enrollment use follow criterion : 1 . Any woman pregnant , ; 2 . Any woman breast-feeding , ; 3 . Any person age &lt; 8 year age , ; 4 . Any patient : - sign plague meningitis - hypotension unresponsive fluid therapy - illness severity score &gt; 16 time enrollment ( see ) - know allergy ciprofloxacin doxycycline - take tetracycline , quinolones , gentamicin , streptomycin , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , chloramphenicol 24 hour precede study enrollment . We enroll suspect plague case high transmission season September April , 2010 2012 . Based enrollment similar study perform previously investigator Madagascar Uganda ( unpublished data , CDC ) give exist epidemiological data plague Uganda , anticipate recruitment 125 200 suspected case plague per year , approximately 40 % 50 % case confirm plague illness , 20-30 % case-fatality rate . Patients monitor daily . Participants may voluntarily withdraw study reason time . The protocol consent form must approve three supervise IRBs ( i.e. , US Centers Disease Control Prevention , Uganda Virus Research Institute Scientific Ethics Committee , Uganda National Council Science Technology ) prior start trial . A Data Safety Monitoring Board review serious adverse event interim final trial data ensure patient safety good trial conduct .</detailed_description>
