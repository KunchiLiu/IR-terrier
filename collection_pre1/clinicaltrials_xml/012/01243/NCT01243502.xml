	<brief_summary>K-252a potent inhibitor nerve growth factor ( NGF ) therefore ability inhibit keratinocyte proliferation . K-252a strongly lipophilic therefore pass freely cell membrane keratinocytes accumulates systemic level . In order reduce dermal absorption reduce possible long-term systemic toxicity study assess PEGylated derivative K-252a name CT327 . This approach improve safety profile K-252a molecule maintain activity . The primary objective ass safety tolerability single repeat dos CT327 apply topically skin healthy male volunteer . The secondary objective evaluate eventual systemic absorption ( pharmacokinetics ; PK ) CT327 follow single repeat dose healthy male subject .</brief_summary>
