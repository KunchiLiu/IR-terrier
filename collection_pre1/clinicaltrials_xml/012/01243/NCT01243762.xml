	<brief_summary>This open-label , two-part study evaluate safety tolerability combination treatment dalotuzumab + MK-2206 , dalotuzumab + MK-0752 , dalotuzumab + MK-8669 ( ridaforolimus ) . The study determine dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) observe administration combination various dos define maximum tolerate dose combination . Preliminary anti-tumor activity combination , two group participant select tumor biomarkers , assess : one group metastatic recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer one group metastatic recurrent colorectal cancer . The dalotuzumab + MK-8669 dalotuzumab + MK-2206 arm enrich female platinum-resistant ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer participant . The dalotuzumab + MK-0752 arm enrich metastatic recurrent wild-type kirsten rat sarcoma ( KRAS ) colorectal cancer participant .</brief_summary>
