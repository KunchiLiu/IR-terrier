	<brief_summary>Background Rationale : Mobility impairment one main correlate decrease level participation daily social activity . Mobility disability often remediable use assistive technology , wheelchair arguably widely use recognizable form . Statistics suggest 250,000 Canadians use wheelchair , majority old adult . Mobility impairment often psychological consequence may independently restrict function participation . Confidence one consequence , accord Bandura 's Social Cognitive Theory , belief individual ability perform behaviour achieve desire outcome . Furthermore , previous finding account 40 % variance factor influence wheelchair mobility participation . It likely confidence wheelchair use may account variance . Recent finding show approximately 40 % wheelchair user report low confidence . Because confidence client-specific modifiable , treatment strategy address low confidence use wheelchair may lead great participation among old adult . Purpose : The overall goal research project evaluate efficacy Wheelchair Skills Training Program confidence use manual wheelchair group non-wheelchair user . Objectives : 1 . Evaluate efficacy Wheelchair Skills Training Program improve confidence use manual wheelchair . 2 . Evaluate efficacy Wheelchair Skills Training Program improve wheelchair performance . 3 . Explore immediate effect exposure wheelchair skill ( outcome measure ) confidence use manual wheelchair . Hypotheses : 1 . Participants take part Wheelchair Skills Training Program significant improvement confidence use manual wheelchair compare control group , measure Wheelchair Use Confidence Scale ( WheelCon ) 2 . Participants receive Wheelchair Skills Training Program significant improvement wheelchair performance compare control group , measure Wheelchair Skills Test ( WST ) . 3 . All participant significant improvement confidence use manual wheelchair exposure wheelchair skill ( baseline assessment ) . Research Method : This study use 2 concurrent Randomized Controlled Trials evaluate efficacy Wheelchair Skills Training Program young old adult . Trial 1 Trial 2 employ different recruitment approach target young versus old adult different inclusion criterion regard age participant . Otherwise research design , protocol procedure . Upon completion data collection , data pool stratified age ( young adult , old adult ) analyse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Mobility impairment primary form report disability also one main correlate decrease level participation daily social activity , important determinant quality life . Mobility disability often remediable use assistive technology , wheelchair arguably widely use recognizable form . Statistics suggest 250,000 Canadians use wheelchairs majority old adult . Sudden health event mobility impairment often psychological consequence may independently restrict function participation . Confidence one consequence , accord Bandura 's Social Cognitive Theory , belief individual ability perform behaviour achieve desire outcome . Furthermore , previous finding account 33 % 40 % variance factor influence wheelchair mobility participation respectively . It likely confidence wheelchair use may account variance . Confidence use wheelchair emerge novel research construct potential significant impact healthy successful age , health service aim towards maintenance functional autonomy among old adult . It conceptualize belief individual ability use wheelchair , recent finding show approximately 40 % wheelchair user low confidence . Because confidence client-specific modifiable , treatment strategy address low confidence use wheelchair may lead great mobility social participation among old adult . Bandura postulate four source information modify confidence : 1 ) enactive mastery ; 2 ) vicarious learning ; 3 ) verbal persuasion ; 4 ) physiological/ affective state . Enactive mastery , experiential learning , perhaps influential source information . Enactive mastery show positively alter many form confidence include related balance , performance activity daily live . In fact , qualitative response community-based study state wheelchair user report increased confidence complete Wheelchair Skills Training Program . It thus plausible wheelchair skill training may positively influence old adult 's confidence ability use wheelchair . However , relationship yet explore . Purpose : The overall goal research project evaluate efficacy Wheelchair Skills Training Program confidence use manual wheelchair young old able-bodied adult . Objectives : 1 . Evaluate efficacy Wheelchair Skills Training Program improve confidence use manual wheelchair . 2 . Evaluate efficacy Wheelchair Skills Training Program improve wheelchair performance . 3 . Explore immediate effect exposure wheelchair skill confidence use manual wheelchair . 4 . Evaluate difference confidence use manual wheelchair young old adult . Hypotheses : 1 . Participants take part Wheelchair Skills Training Program significant improvement confidence use manual wheelchair compare control group . 2 . Participants receive Wheelchair Skills Training Program significant improvement wheelchair performance compare control group . 3 . Confidence use manual wheelchair improve exposure wheelchair skill . 4 . Younger adult significantly high confidence use manual wheelchair compare old adult . Research Method : Concurrent Randomized Controlled Trials group younger ( Trial 1 ) old ( Trial 2 ) adult . Trial 1- Participants : Undergraduate graduate , able-bodied student recruit University British Columbia use letter information , poster , word-of-mouth . Sample Size : 20 ( 10 intervention , 10 control ) Trial 2- Participants : Able-bodied community living , old adult Sample Size : 20 ( 10 intervention , 10 control ) Trial 1 Trial 2- Design : Parallel group , randomize control trial . Procedures : Informed consent obtain interested participant . Demographic information information anxiety depression , cognitive functioning , risk propensity collect . Participants randomly allocate either Wheelchair Skills Training Program ( WSTP ) Control group use table random number . All participant complete baseline follow-up measure confidence use manual wheelchair wheelchair performance . Participants intervention group complete WSTP , participant control receive one phone call email study investigator . Statistical Analysis : Demographic information , anxiety depression , cognitive functioning , risk propensity analyze use descriptive statistic . The change confidence use manual wheelchair group ( WSTP Control ) analyze use 2X3X2 repeated measure ANOVA . The change confidence use manual wheelchair group ( WSTP Control ) analyze use 2X2X2 repeated measure ANOVA . All data analyze use SPPS Version 15.0 , alpha equal 0.05 .</detailed_description>
