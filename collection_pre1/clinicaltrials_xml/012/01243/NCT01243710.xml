	<brief_title>Taurolidine Haemodialysis Catheter Related Bacteraemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infections relate long-term haemodialysis catheter associate significant morbidity . A high proportion people initially treat antibiotic clear catheter infection develop second infection within six month , necessitate removal replacement dialysis catheter . This study examine efficacy antimicrobial catheter lock solution call taurolidine heparin prevent second infection within six month significant infection . This solution compare solution use currently ( heparin ) leave inside catheter dialysis session . This clinical study give antimicrobial catheter lock think reduce risk blood stream infection ultimate need catheter change . However , concern absence anticoagulant lock solution increase risk catheter thrombosis , require change catheter separate reason . It unclear therefore whether solution contain taurolidine ( antimicrobial ) heparin ( anticoagulant ) increase catheter survival . The result study help guide appropriate suse lock solution future .</detailed_description>
