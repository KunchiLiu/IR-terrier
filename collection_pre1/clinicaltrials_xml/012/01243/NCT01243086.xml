	<brief_summary>In Western World , Age Related Macular Degeneration ( ARMD ) lead cause blindness . This disease think natural part aging , recent research introduce effective treatment . ARMD relate body initiate immune response eye , respond infection . Vision impact ocular tissue become inflamed new blood vessel form back eye , process call angiogenesis . In severe wet form ARMD , blood fluid leak vessel impair eye 's structure function . Many study show ranibizumab , drug stop formation new blood vessel ( anti-angiogenic agent ) delay damage eye often restore vision . The investigator believe best drug therapy also stop inflammation . OZURDEX , steroid drug , show potential effectively reduce inflammation application . The investigator aim investigate patient receive combination treatment ranibizumab OZURDEX improve visual ability receive ranibizumab treatment alone . Secondarily , investigator also investigate often patient receive drug therapy regime require re-treatment often experience vision loss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Age Related Macular Degeneration ( ARMD AMD ) lead cause blindness North America . There two type ARMD : dry wet . Both form ARMD cause progressive loss central vision , part vision allow read , drive see image sharp detail directly front . The wet form typically severe characterize growth leakage small blood vessel choroid layer eye , back eye . These leak blood vessel disrupt structure function eye , cause loss vision , particularly sharp vision create macula area eye . Upon accepted study , participant randomly divide two group . One group receive ranibizumab OZURDEX injection group receive ranibizumab injection placebo treatment . To participant group , appearance second injection actual injection take place . An individual connect study assign participant group base computer-generated system , give participant 50 % chance place either group . During study , participant know group , able know study finish . Participants ask come initial assessment determine start visual ability medical history . On next appointment , participant receive first treatment injection . They ask come clinic every month six ( 6 ) month total treatment injection test . At appointment , study investigator take 3-D image retina ( back eye ) use Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) image device , test eye pressure determine sign infection inflammation injection . On month 1 , 3 6 investigator also test vision use Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual acuity chart , contrast sensitivity use standard contrast sensitivity chart ( The Pelli-Robson chart ) take image blood vessel growth use colour dye ( fluorescein ) help see blood vessel . Before every treatment , anesthetic eye drop ( proparacaine ) apply eye participant feel injection . Participants give antibiotic eye drop ( ZymarÂ® ) ask apply drop 4 time day day injection prevent infection .</detailed_description>
