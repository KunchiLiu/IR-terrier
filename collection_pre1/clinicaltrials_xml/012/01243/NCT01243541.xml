	<brief_title>Cryotherapy Preventing Peripheral Neuropathy Nail Toxicity Patients With Breast Cancer Who Are Receiving Paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Differences `` tingle '' `` numbness '' ( measure 0-10 numeric rating scale ; measure NPSI ) treat untreated extremity conclusion paclitaxel therapy ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Differences nail toxicity treat untreated extremity measure NCI-CTC v4.0 baseline conclusion taxane therapy time point ( infusion conclusion taxane therapy ) . II . Differences peripheral sensory neuropathy subscale NCI-CTC v 4.0 treat untreated extremity time point ( infusion conclusion paclitaxel therapy ) . III . Differences pain intensity ( 0-10 BPI ) treat untreated extremity time point ( infusion conclusion paclitaxel therapy ) . IV . Differences quantitative sensory test treat untreated extremity time point ( infusion conclusion paclitaxel therapy ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1of 2 treatment arm . ARM I . Patients wear Elasto-Gel cold glove sock dominant hand foot every two week day patient schedule paclitaxel.The glove sock wear 15 minute prior paclitaxel infusion , 3 hour treatment , 15 minute completion chemotherapy total 210 minute . ARM II : Patients wear Elasto-Gel cold glove sock non-dominant hand foot every two week day patient schedule paclitaxel . The glove sock wear 15 minute prior paclitaxel infusion , 3 hour treatment , 15 minute completion chemotherapy total 210 minute . In arm , treatment repeat every 2 week 4 course absence unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
