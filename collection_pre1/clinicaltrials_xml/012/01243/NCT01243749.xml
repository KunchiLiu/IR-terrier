	<detailed_description>The Resolute stent design support approach deliver drug coronary arterial tissue longer period time offer current approve DES product . This method prolong drug elution may address need control local vascular neointimal proliferation patient complex lesion extend therapeutic effect . The purpose multi-center trial investigate clinical safety efficacy Endeavor Resolute drug-eluting stent every-day patient , like stable unstable patient single multi-vessel disease and/or complex lesion . Patients treat accord normal hospital routine practice line applicable guideline percutaneous coronary intervention Instructions For Use device . 1800 patient enrol China approximately 40 center Endeavor Resolute stent commercially available .</detailed_description>
