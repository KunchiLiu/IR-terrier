	<brief_summary>NVC-422 topical , non-antibiotic , fast-acting , broad-spectrum anti-microbial , exhibit potential prevent growth urinary pathogen , include Proteus others . The use catheter irrigation solution prevent biofilm formation encrustation lead blockage may keep catheter patent longer , result few catheter change , potentially low incidence UTIs , well patient quality life . The study population include male female spinal cord injury ( SCI ) neurogenic bladder patient chronic indwell transurethral urinary catheter recent repeat history urinary catheter encrustation and/or blockage . Subjects receive two treatment regimen : one treatment regimen NVC-422 sterile irrigation solution one treatment regimen sterile saline irrigation solution . Each treatment regimen consist total 8 treatment , washout period treatment regimen .</brief_summary>
