	<brief_summary>Trial Design : This clinical trial phase III multicenter , randomize , double blind control placebo trial two arm design assess efficiency toxicity scheme Lenalidomide versus observation series 60 patient low risk myelodysplastic syndrome associate 5q deletion anemia ( Hb≤12g/dL ) without need transfusion . Patients randomize study 2:1 ratio . They receive treatment 104 week progression disease , imply patient suffer anemia due myelodysplastic syndrome require transfusion least 2 UCH/56 day ( 2 month ) minimum follow 112 day ( 4 month ) , unacceptable toxicity . Disease : Low risk myelodysplastic syndrome associate loss 5q without transfusion requirement . Total number patient : In total 60 patient include , 40 assign treatment branch 20 placebo branch . Calendar : First patient first visit : February 2010 , Last patient last visit expect February 2016 . ( Recruitment initially expect take place period 24 month expect finish February 2012 , due low rate recruitment extend population sample include trial ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study REVLIMID ( Lenalidomide ) Versus Placebo Patients With Low Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General summary myelodysplastic syndrome alteration 5q . Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) heterogenic group diseases characterize presence morphologic feature dyshemopoiesis bone marrow ( BM ) peripheral blood ( PB ) , translate inefficient hematopoiesis . This lead concomitant development peripheral cytopenia cause complication patient , case , cause death . In addition , patient increase risk develop acute leukemia , risk increase progression disease.MDS represent incurable disease standard treatment quite variable survival mean range 3 month 15 year depend number blast , number cytopenia type cytogenetic disorders2 . The sole curative treatment MDS allogenic transplant hematopoietic progenitor option available 5 % patient MDS . Lenalidomide , initially know CC-5013 , analogue immunomodulator Drug Thalidomide ( Thalidomid® ; Pharmion Corp. , Boulder , CO , USA ) , first drug anti-angiogenic immunomodulator property investigate MDS . Lenalidomide , well thalidomide , broad array potential activity dysplastic cell , fully know , among find immunomodulator non-immunomodulator property ( anti-angiogenic effect , anti-proliferative pro-apoptotic ) . The great advantage Lenalidomide comparison thalidomide former 50 2000 time stronger tan thalidomide respect immunomodulator effect . And moreover , toxic profile Lenalidomide seem low analogue ; Thalidomide . There treatment indication present time patient low risk MDS associate loss 5q without transfusion dependent anemia . The result Lenalidomide highly promise patient low risk MDS associate loss 5q ( test ) red blood cell transfusion dependent anemia . In sense , proposal consist able state treatment Lenalidomide efficient diagnose prevent CH transfusion acceptable toxicity . In sense , present study intention treat early patient low-risk MDS associate loss 5q view prevent CH transfusion . Therefore , could extend patient time CH transfusion even assess possibility eradicate disease cytogenetic/morphologic level . In present trial give characteristic patient , choose option supply Lenalidomide dose 5mg/day . The option consider low dose one currently consider `` standard '' ( 10mg/day ) reduce toxicity , mainly hematologic , patient receive treatment normally . A dose low toxicity choose revealed efficient . Main efficiency objective : •To ass treatment Revlimid ( Lenalidomide ) extend period progression myelodysplastic syndrome del ( 5q ) consider transfusion independent , documented verification patient suffer anemia due MDS require transfusion least 2 UCH/56 day ( 2 month ) minimum follow 112 day ( 4 month ) . Revlimid compare current standard treatment patient low risk myelodysplastic syndrome associate loss 5qwithout transfusion dependent anemia , therapeutic abstention monitoring progression . Secondary efficiency objective : - Erythroid response accord Criteria myelodysplastic syndrome International Work Team 2006 ) . - Duration red blood cell transfusion independency ( defined number day elapse randomization first transfusion period free transfusion ) . - Change hemoglobin concentration ( Hb ) relation baseline level patient show erythroid response . - Variation platelet absolute count relation baseline level . - Variation neutrophil absolute count relation baseline level . - Cytogenetic response accord Criteria myelodysplastic syndrome International Work Team . - Bone marrow response accord Criteria myelodysplastic syndrome International Work Team . - To assess safety tolerance Lenalidomide scheme , measure accord incidence clinical laboratory toxicity . - Global survival , Event Free Survival Rate Transformation Acute Leukemia . - Time diagnose transfusion independence . Main safety objective : Safety ( type , frequency severity [ Criteria normal terminology adverse reaction National Cancer Institute ( NCI CTCAE ) version 3.0 ] adverse reaction ( AR ) list AR Lenalidomide .</detailed_description>
