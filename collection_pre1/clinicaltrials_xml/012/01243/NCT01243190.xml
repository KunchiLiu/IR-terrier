	<brief_title>Ofatumumab High-Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) /Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( SLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Ofatumumab design bind surface white blood cell ( B-cells ) . It may destroy cancer cell come B-cells . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive `` load dose '' ( low dose give first , low risk bad reaction study drug ) ofatumumab vein Day 1 Cycle 1 . The load dose less one-third ( 1/3 ) normal dose . You receive normal dose 4 hour 1 time week ( +/- 3 day ) . The dos may give slowly , doctor think need . All dos study drug give M. D. Anderson . Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) glucocorticoid ( steroids prednisolone ) give vein 30 minute 2 hour receive ofatumumab help prevent side effect . You also take pill acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) help prevent side effect . If side effect occur , `` pre-medications '' may reduce give second infusion . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week , receive ofatumumab : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask feel , side effect may , change health since last visit . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Study : You may continue take study drug Day 50 , long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , develop hepatitis B , decide go study . End-of-Treatment Visit : On day last treatment stop receive study drug reason , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask feel , side effect may , change health since last visit . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw hepatitis test . Follow-Up : About 3 month ( +/- 2 week ) end-of-treatment visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask feel , side effect may , change health since last visit . - You bone marrow aspirate biopsy , well CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis , check status disease . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw hepatitis testing . Every 3 month ( +/- 4 week ) end-of-treatment visit 6 month : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask feel , side effect may , change health since last visit . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw hepatitis testing . Every year ( +/- 4 week ) end-of-treatment visit : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask feel , side effect may , change health since last visit . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspirate biopsy , well CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis , check status disease . This investigational study . Ofatumumab FDA approve commercially available use treatment CLL . The use ofatumumab early treatment patient CLL/SLL receive treatment investigational . Up 44 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
