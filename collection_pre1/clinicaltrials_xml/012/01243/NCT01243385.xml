	<brief_title>Metformin Hydrochloride First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine activity safety metformin hydrochloride first-line therapy patient locally advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral metformin hydrochloride twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Previously collect post-treatment tumor tissue may analyze PTEN status PI3kinase-dependent pathway activation via immunohistochemistry . Blood sample may also collect periodically analyzed biomarkers , pharmacogenetics , pharmacodynamics , pharmacokinetics . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
