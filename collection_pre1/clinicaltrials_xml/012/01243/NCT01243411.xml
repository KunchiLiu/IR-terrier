	<brief_summary>This study Phase 3 , open-label study safety efficacy AA4500 0.58 mg subject Peyronie 's disease . Subjects screen study eligibility within 21 day initial injection study drug first treatment cycle . After four treatment cycle , subject follow additional safety efficacy assessment Days 168 ( ± 7 day ) 252 ( ± 7 day ) ( nominal week 24 36 ) . After final injection treatment cycle , investigator model plaque attempt stretch elongate plaque . If subject 's penile curvature reduce &lt; 15° first , second , third cycle injection investigator determines treatment clinically indicate ( eg , adverse event ; allergic reaction ) , subsequent treatment cycle administer . Approximately 300 subject enrol .</brief_summary>

Has follow condition : Chordee presence absence hypospadias Thrombosis dorsal penile artery and/or vein Infiltration benign malignant mass result penile curvature Infiltration infectious agent , lymphogranuloma venereum Ventral curvature cause Presence active sexually transmitted disease Known active hepatitis B C Known immune deficiency disease positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 3 . Has previously undergone surgery Peyronie 's disease 4 . Fails erection opinion investigator sufficient accurately measure subject 's penile deformity administration prostaglandin E1 trimix 5 . Has calcify plaque evident appropriate radiographic evaluation , penile xray penile ultrasound would prevent proper injection study medication ( penile ultrasound EU country ) . Noncontiguous stipple calcium acceptable inclusion provide calcium deposit interfere injection AA4500 plaque 6 . Has isolate hourglass deformity penis 7 . Has plaque cause curvature penis locate proximal base penis , injection local anesthetic would interfere injection AA4500 plaque 8 . Has previously receive alternative medical therapy Peyronie 's disease administer intralesional route ( include , limited , steroid , verapamil , naturally occur low molecular weight protein , interferonα2b ) within 3 month first dose study drug plan use medical therapy time study 9 .
