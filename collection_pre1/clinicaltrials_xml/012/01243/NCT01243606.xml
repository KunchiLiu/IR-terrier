	<brief_summary>Anxiety disorder common , chronic , costly , debilitating quality life , prevalent class disorder every country world survey take . Deepening understanding nature anxiety relate emotional disorder last decade reveal commonality etiology latent structure among disorder supersedes difference . At time , examination extant single diagnosis psychological treatment protocol ( SDPs ) disorder underscores mechanistic similarity . These finding suggest possibility distil set psychological procedure would comprise innovative Unified Protocol Transdiagnostic Treatment Emotional Disorders ( UP ) , protocol develop . If efficacious , UP may represent efficient possibly effective strategy would render treatment implication comorbidity , otherwise specify ( NOS ) subdefinitional threshold anxiety disorder condition moot . The investigator propose evaluation efficacy UP group patient heterogeneous anxiety disorder way rigorous comparison exist evidence base SDPs benchmarked wait list control condition , use statistical equivalence superiority analyse . Additional aim include determine durability UP relative comparison condition treatment discontinuation , ascertain differential impact treatment disorder specific symptom vs. higher-order temperamental variable . Further analysis indicate change high order temperamental variable mediate long-term outcome preliminary data suggests , mechanism action differs among treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Evaluation Unified Transdiagnostic Treatment Anxiety Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose proposal evaluate efficacy recently develop Unified Protocol Transdiagnostic Treatment Emotional Disorders ( UP ) . This protocol take advantage recent advance understanding nature anxiety disorder , well emerge knowledge process regulation change anxious behavior , order distill refine basic principle successful psychological treatment anxiety disorder . It expect approach simplify train dissemination , provide good coverage comorbid condition , cover `` otherwise specify '' ( NOS ) sub-definitional threshold presentation , possibly improve efficacy particularly long term , perhaps also shed light nature anxiety disorder . A heterogeneous sample 250 patient meet diagnostic criterion least one four anxiety disorder : Social Phobia ( SAD ) , Panic Disorder without Agoraphobia ( PD/A ) , Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) , Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) randomize one three treatment cell : ( 1 ) Unified Protocol ( UP ) ; ( 2 ) single diagnosis psychological treatment protocol ( SDP ) ; ( 3 ) Wait List ( WL ) . A minimum 50 patient 4 principal diagnostic category include randomization ensure adequate representation anxiety disorder . The study consist two phase : ( 1 ) 12 16 week acute treatment phase ( 16 week WL ) ( 2 ) 12-month follow-up phase , active treatment discontinue patient follow assess long-term effect treatment ( outcome measure discuss ) . Patients randomize WL condition enter post-treatment period . Rather , immediately assign choice either UP SDP treatment end sixteen week wait period . All assessment treatment procedure conduct Center Anxiety Related Disorders ( CARD ) Boston University , one large research clinic devote anxiety relate emotional disorder world . Total duration participation study exceed 18 month total . The major aim proposal : Primary Aims Aim 1 : Evaluate efficacy UP apply group patient heterogeneous anxiety disorder compare group receive exist evidence-based single diagnosis treatment protocol ( SDPs ) benchmarked wait list control condition ( WL ) determine treatment responsiveness sample common measure outcome . Aim 2 : Evaluate efficacy UP SDPs relative benchmark WL condition . Aim 3 : Determine long-term efficacy UP relative SDPs 1-year period follow treatment discontinuation . Aim 4 : Examine relative effect active treatment approach ( UP &amp; SDPs ) comorbid anxiety depressive disorder severity . Secondary Aims Aim 5 : Ascertain relative effect active treatment higher-order temperamental index . Aim 6 : Determine change high order temperamental variable mediates long term outcome .</detailed_description>
