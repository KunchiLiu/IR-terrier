	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study develop advanced software program collect , compare analyze tumor image evaluation . Another purpose study learn new radio-tracer tumor image call 3'-deoxy-3 ' ( 18 ) F-fluorothymidine ( FLT ) improve evaluation tumor PET/CT scan . This new type image track meant improve visualization tumor active size .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FLT PET/CT Staging , Target Definition Assessment Response Therapy Patients With Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The following standard medical procedure part regular cancer care participant would probably do even join study : Chemotherapy ; physical examination ; pregnancy test ( applicable ) ; diagnostic FDG-PET/CT scan treatment evaluate disease . - The following diagnostic procedure do specifically study : Three FLT-PET/CT scan , treatment one FDG PET/CT scan treatment . - Participants research study approximately 12-14 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma esophagus gastroesophageal junction . Biopsy cytology primary tumor , involve regional lymph node , acceptable . Tumors must TNM stage T24 , N01 , M0 determine pretreatment endoscopic ultrasound . T1 tumor eligible T1 , N1 , M0 . Regional thoracic lymph node involvement permit . Disease must clinically limited esophagus gastroesophageal junction . If tumor extends gastroesophageal junction proximal stomach , 50 % tumor must involve distal esophagus gastroesophageal junction . Adenocarcinomas distal esophagus would therefore include tumor gastroesophageal junction involve equally distal esophagus proximal stomach , Siewert type II . Tumor much surgically resectable minimum length 2cm . Patients must judge oncologist candidate combine modality therapy chemotherapy consist oxaliplatin protract infusion 5FU concurrent radiation . FDG PET/CT perform offsite must available review Overall PI DICOM format perform within one month study entry 18 year age old ECOG Performance Status 01 Laboratory value outline protocol No prior chemotherapy radiotherapy permit . Patients must least 4 week since major surgery , must recover effect minor surgery . No prior malignancy ( basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cervical carcinoma , superficial transitional cell bladder carcinoma ) permit unless diagnose and/or treat 3 year long registration without evidence recurrence . Patients follow tumor characteristic eligible : TIS ( situ carcinoma ) ; tumor determine T1N0 follow endoscopic ultrasound ; supraclavicular ( distal tumor ) celiac ( proximal tumor ) lymph node involvement , determine EUS , CT scan , PET scan , unless proven false positive appropriate biopsy ; cervical esophageal tumor , gastric cancer minor involvement gastroesophageal junction distal esophagus ; patient tracheoesophageal fistulas Patients evidence metastatic disease No poorly control diabetes despite attempt improve glucose control fast duration adjustment medication Pregnant breast feed woman exclude HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible</criteria>
