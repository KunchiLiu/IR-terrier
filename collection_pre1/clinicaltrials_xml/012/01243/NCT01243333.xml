	<brief_summary>The treatment cancer increasingly aim molecular target derive study oncogene tumor suppressor know involved development human cancer . The increased specificity obtain new targeted treatment develop past many decade . From use general cytotoxic agent nitrogen mustard 1940s , development natural-product anticancer drug 1960s include Vinca alkaloid anthracyclines improvement cancer chemotherapy . Early development process drug use find cytotoxic cancer cell normal cell . Later development include use specific monoclonal antibody immunotoxins target cell surface receptor . In addition , knowledge molecular biology increase , specific agent inactivate kinase growth-promoting pathway use treat cancer . These new target approach improve response rate cancer reduce side effect anticancer treatment yet result cure majority patient metastatic disease . There general broad classification chemotherapeutic drug effect . One early still utilized cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Tracer PET Early Phase Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Positron emission tomography ( PET ) molecular image modality probe various aspect tumor biology use variety radio-labeled imaging agent also call `` tracer '' . Oncologic PET image see dramatic rise clinical utilization past decade cancer detection , stag , evaluate residual recurrent disease follow therapy . These clinical scan use tracer [ 18F ] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ( FDG ) , accumulate cell proportion glucose ( GLUT ) transporter hexokinase activity . FDG provide measure tissue glucose metabolism . Concurrent clinical growth , number PET tracer receive significant attention research variety image target . Of special interest tracer 3'-deoxy-3'- [ 18F ] fluorothymidine ( FLT ) [ 15O ] water ( H215O ) . The uptake , retention/washout , ultimate biodistribution tracer related different functional molecular process . As , use probe different aspect tumor biology : FLT directly assess tumor proliferation H2O quantify tumor perfusion . This companion clinical study design obtain pre-therapeutic imaging assessment use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image 50 evaluable patient ( patient baseline follow-up PET image ) various form malignancy approximately 28 day ( day 25 -32 ) . Overview PET Tracers FDG , FLT , H2O The use specifically target image agent , PET radiopharmaceutical , great potential overcoming limitation standard anatomic imaging malignancy Hypotheses Tested : The drive hypothesis overall line research multiple PET image biomarkers provide improve image-guided personalize care patient various malignancy receive investigational therapy recently approve therapy Huntsman Cancer Institute ( HCI ) . The term `` personalize care '' use broadly include prediction tumor behavior prior start therapy , tumor surveillance , prognostication , eventually individualized assignment patient conventional , aggressive , investigational therapy early clinical course . This pilot project obtain initial data value PET biomarkers image-guided personalized care . Specific hypothesis test include : - HYPOTHESIS I : Dynamic single-scan PET image provide biologically relevant functional assessment effect early course therapy compare standard Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) metric response . A composite standardized uptake value ( SUV ) construct PET tracer apply individual . Subjects &lt; 35 % decrease composite SUV classify `` progress PET '' , subject â‰¥ 35 % decrease composite SUV classify `` non-progressing PET '' . - HYPOTHESIS II : Multi-tracer PET biomarkers , obtain conjunction novel therapeutic , well able predict tumor aggressiveness conventional radiographic imaging . This include good prediction time progression ( TTP ) patient survival - HYPOTHESIS III : Characterization multiple aspect tumor function ( glucose metabolism , proliferation , perfusion ) baseline therapy provide new insight tumor status eventually guide selection appropriate therapy . Sufficient statistical power expect obtained companion protocol validate experimental imaging evaluation hypothesis I . Hypotheses II III exploratory provide insight valuable information use subsequent multi-tracer PET study . Data regard three hypothesis obtain work study correlation PET image biomarkers clinical outcome available tumor biologic information . Clinical Rationale : This companion clinical study design obtain pre-therapeutic imaging assessment use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image 50 evaluable patient ( patient baseline followup PET image ) various form malignancy approximately 28 day ( day 25-32 ) , institution therapeutic drug various primary therapeutic clinical trial . The propose PET image companion study use patient receive investigational recently approve therapy . The investigational therapy recently approve therapy vary appropriate companion PET image study use assess relevant therapeutic effect .</detailed_description>
