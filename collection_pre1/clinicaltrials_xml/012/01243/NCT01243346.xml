	<brief_title>Phase II Study Crenolanib ( CP-868,596 ) , Treatment Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors With D842-related Mutations Deletions PDGFRA Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crenolanib ( CP-868,596 ) orally bioavailable , selective inhibitor PDGFR receptor tyrosine kinase IC50s 0.4 ng/mL 0.8 ng/mL PDGFRα PDGFRβ , respectively . In preclinical model cell line D842V mutation PDGFRA gene , crenolanib ( CP-868,596 ) block phosphorylation PDGFRα nanomolar concentration , suggest may provide clinical benefit patient D842V mutant GIST . In addition , crenolanib also active inhibit phosphorylation cell line two point mutation ( double mutant ) PDGFRA V561D + D842V PDGFRA T674I + D842V .</detailed_description>
