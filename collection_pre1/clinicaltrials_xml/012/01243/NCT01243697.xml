	<brief_summary>The congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ( CCHS ) , also know Ondine syndrome , rare genetic disorder . In contrast healthy people , patient increase breathe response excess carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . As consequence , breath sufficiently , even stop breathing , sleep . Their survival depend mechanical respiratory assistance , life long . We recently publish two case recovery response CO2 patient take desogestrel contraceptive pill . The goal study therefore assess hypothesis desogestrel restore respiratory response CO2 CCHS patient allow breath sufficiently sleep without mechanical assistance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale study The congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ( CCHS ) , also call Ondine syndrome Ondine 's curse , rare orphan disease associate mutation PHOX 2B gene . It characterize absence deep reduction ventilatory response hypercapnia hypoxia . As consequence , life-threatening hypoventilation apnea occur sleep , patient , also wakefulness . Survival thus depend mechanical ventilatory assistance ( phrenic pacing ) , life long . There pharmacological treatment . We fortuitously observe two case recovery ventilatory response hypercapnia patient take desogestrel , potent progestin , contraceptive treatment ( `` Straus , C. , et al . Respir . Physiol . Neurobiol . 2010 ; 171 : 171-174 '' ) . The hypothesis research project stem observation . It assume desogestrel restore chemosensitivity hypercapnia Ondine patient allow breath sufficiently without mechanical ventilatory assistance sleep . The primary goal study ass whether treatment desogestrel restore ventilatory response hypercapnia . The secondary goal evaluate whether response allow patient weaned mechanical ventilatory assistance sleep . Methods The study take place one unique hospital , Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital Paris , France . It conduct volunteer pubescent female patient . Patients contra-indications desogestrel include . The ventilatory response hypercapnia assess rebreathing method blind procedure specifically design study . Sleep breathe sleep assess polysomnography . Blood gas analysis well hormonal ionic analysis blood perform . The ventilatory response hypoxia also assess . Changes cerebral activation look use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Protocol Patients first assessed test mention paragraph , except fMRI . Polysomnography perform mechanical ventilation . Patients take contraceptive oral treatment estrogens progestin whose response hypercapnia low enough immediately continue study . An fMRI perform patient prescribe desogestrel 75 µg daily . Patients oral contraceptive treatment estrogens progestin stop use mechanical contraception ( condom ) . All patient take oral contraceptive treatment assess stop drug , test mention `` method '' paragraph , except fMRI . Polysomnography perform mechanical ventilation . If ventilatory response hypercapnia low enough fMRI perform patient prescribe desogestrel 75 µg daily . All patient assess treatment desogestrel . If slope ventilatory response hypercapnia 1L/min/mmHg , attempt wean mechanical ventilation sleep replace usual polysomnography mechanical ventilation . The patient admit intensive care unit sleep without ventilatory assistance . Polysomnographic recording perform portable device . In case prolong hypopnea apneas case arterial desaturation , patient awaken mechanical ventilation resume . The attempt wean regarded failure . In absence criterion , wean regard possible success . However , investigator prescribe patient sleep without ventilatory assistance . Their attending physician take final decision regard issue .</detailed_description>
