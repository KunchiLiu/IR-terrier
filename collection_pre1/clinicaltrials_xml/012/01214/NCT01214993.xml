	<brief_summary>The current study design confirm mechanism behind increase serum creatinine observe GSK1349572 therapy ; specifically , study determine whether GSK1349572 effect glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) effective renal plasma flow . Absent effect , one may conclude small increase serum creatinine observe due inhibition tubular secretion creatinine via organic cation transporter 2 ( OCT2 ) consistent vitro data . .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 , Open Label , Placebo-Controlled Study Evaluate Effect GSK1349572 Iohexol Para-Aminohippurate Clearance Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK1349572 integrase inhibitor develop treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -1 infection GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) behalf Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare LLC . In healthy subject dose-ranging clinical trial GSK1349572 , subject show small , reversible increase serum creatinine concentration compare control group ; occur early study drug administration progress time . In vitro data demonstrate GSK1349572 inhibit organic cation transporter ( OCT2 ) , mediate tubular secretion creatinine ; drug cimetidine similar effect OCT2 lead nonpathological increase creatinine effect glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . The current study design confirm mechanism behind increase serum creatinine observe GSK1349572 therapy ; specifically , study determine whether GSK1349572 effect GFR effective renal plasma flow . Absent effect , one may conclude small increase serum creatinine observe due inhibition tubular secretion creatinine via OCT2 . Subjects give GSK1349572 50mg daily , 50mg twice daily placebo daily 14 day . Changes subject 's GFR measure administration iohexol effective renal plasma flow measure use Para-Aminohippurate ( PAH ) day -1 , 7 14 . Changes serum creatinine renal biomarkers evaluate baseline various time point throughout study .</detailed_description>
