	<brief_summary>The treatment severe form alcoholic hepatitis ( AH ) constitute major challenge clinician involve management severe alcoholic liver disease . In patient Maddrey function high 32 , compel evidence data show corticosteroid improve short-term survival . However , novel strategy molecule require light fact approximately 40 % patient continue die 6 month . A double-blinded randomized control trial 101 patient show Pentoxifylline improves survival patient severe AH , compare placebo . In term mechanism , effect pentoxifylline relate prevention hepatorenal function whereas corticosteroids induce early improvement liver function . When consider difference mechanisms , many clinician suggest addition pentoxyfilline corticosteroid attractive option need test patient severe AH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim present study determine whether adjunction Pentoxifylline corticosteroid would improve 6-month survival patient severe alcoholic hepatitis . This multicenter , randomize , double-blinded , control , phase 3 trial conduct 24 center locate France Belgium . Alcoholic hepatitis biopsy-proven . All eligible patient randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive corticosteroid + Pentoxifylline corticosteroid + Placebo . The primary outcome study 6-month survival . Assuming two-sided type I error 0.05 , randomization ratio 1:1 2 group , 6-month survival 64 % Placebo Corticosteroids group 78 % Pentoxifylline Corticosteroids group , estimate 268 randomized patient ( 134 group ) , study would power 80 % detect increase 6-month survival Pentoxifylline Corticosteroid group .</detailed_description>
