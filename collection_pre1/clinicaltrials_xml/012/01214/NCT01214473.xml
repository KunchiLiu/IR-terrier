India , one world 's large population , continue struggle extremely high infant neonatal mortality rate . Sepsis account 50 % death among community bear ( 20 % mortality among hospital-born ) infant . Closely link burgeon problem antimicrobial resistance , increasingly restrict therapeutic option medical care provider . Friendly bacteria call `` Probiotics '' use multiple infectious inflammatory disease state human . Fructooligosaccharides sugar find naturally many fruit vegetable also human breast milk .

The current study use probiotic preparation contain Lactobacillus plantarum fructooligosaccharides attempt prevent neonatal infection . Currently conclusive data available utility probiotic condition . If successful , inexpensive preventive therapy make available general public resource poor country .

	<detailed_description>Our current study attempt put well know concept probiotic rigorous scientific testing could recommend prophylactic therapy neonatal infection . The study conduct India 8,442 infant receive daily dose probiotic one week . They follow 60 day home . We design study enough power detect 20 % drop incidence rate plan collect multiple demographic data mother infant help u discern possible contribution confound risk factor implicate cofactor neonatal infection death . This randomize controlled clinical trial involve probiotic ( Lactobacillus plantarum 10 billion bacteria 150 mg fructo-oligosaccharide ) . We use well establish three tier monitor system village . Infants adverse event ( include sepsis infection ) bring attach study hospital clinical care . Blood and/or CSG culture do use Bactec blood culture system treatment provide base clinical judgment microbiological analysis blood/CSF and/or finding chest X-ray . Data entry do site transmit principal investigator 's institution U.S. A data safety monitor board convene expert clinician , neonatologists , biostatisticians monitor study yearly frequently require . Analyzed data publish appropriate journal .</detailed_description>
