	<detailed_description>Diabetic kidney disease increase prevalence associate significant morbidity mortality . Health disparity exist progression diabetic kidney disease , minority affect even adjust treatment , glycemic hypertensive control , medical coverage . Secondary prevention progression diabetic kidney disease hinder lack easily modifiable risk factor . Based animal observational human study , vitamin D deficiency potentially novel , modifiable risk factor may interrupt delay progression diabetic kidney disease direct effect well help ameliorate kidney disease risk factor , hyperglycemia , hypertension inflammation . In addition , base minority higher prevalence vitamin D deficiency , may also potentially impact differential progression diabetic kidney disease minority . However , clinical trial evaluate impact vitamin D supplementation diabetic kidney disease lack . Thus , pilot study fund R03 National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) follow specific aim : ( 1 ) : To evaluate impact vitamin D supplementation ( vitamin D3 400 IU/d versus 4000 IU/d ) proportion individual progression albuminuria 12 month sample African American participant vitamin D deficiency randomize control trial . ( 2 ) : To identify whether kidney disease risk factor blood pressure glycemic control mediate impact vitamin D supplementation progression albuminuria 12 month sample African American participant vitamin D deficiency randomize control trial .</detailed_description>
