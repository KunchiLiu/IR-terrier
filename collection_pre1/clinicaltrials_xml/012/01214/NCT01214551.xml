	<brief_title>Exercise-induced Bronchoconstriction Diagnostics : Impact Repeated Exercise Challenge Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior study show intensity influence sensitivity exercise challenge test ( ECT ) heart rate-based protocol ensure sufficient exercise intensity induce bronchoconstriction . It common clinical practice perform pre ECT establish maximal heart rate maximal oxygen uptake . The heart rate formula recommend ATS ( HRmax= 220âˆ’age ) usually apply determine recommend intensity ECT . Conducting second ECT , base knowledge first test , introduce possibility adjust intensity individual basis . In addition , base clinical experience , patient may seem reluctant perform maximal first time undergo ECT treadmill . The hypothesis patient less reluctant perform maximal second time undergo test accustom procedure treadmill .</detailed_description>
