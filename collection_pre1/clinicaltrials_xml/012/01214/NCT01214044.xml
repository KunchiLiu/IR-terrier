	<detailed_description>Background : The human biological clock ( circadian pacemaker ) long think play role non-seasonal depression . A connection suggest demonstration 24-hour rhythm mood , subjective objective change sleep depression , report change time amplitude biological rhythm depression . Furthermore , know neurotransmitter serotonin significant role regulate biological rhythm drug act serotonin ( antidepressant ) able reset biological clock animal . Objective : The aim study obtain preliminary data test whether antidepressant medication escitalopram reset effect human biological clock whether improvement depression symptom escitalopram correlate degree time biological clock realign timing sleep . Design : 14-16-week , fix dose ( titration ) , open label trial . Setting Subjects : 50 individual screen participation . 15 individual unipolar , non-seasonal depression study 1 year . Intervention : Subjects first complete one week , single-blind placebo lead-in phase . Subjects receive escitalopram 8 week ( 10 mg/day first 2 week treatment 20mg/day remain 6 week treatment ) . Measurements : Subjects keep sleep diary wear wrist activity monitor throughout study document time quality sleep . On two occasion ( end placebo week end last treatment week ) blood and/or saliva sample every 30 minute 7 hour result sample assay melatonin . The onset melatonin secretion ( dim light melatonin onset DLMO ) use mark time biological clock ( circadian phase ) . Circadian misalignment measure use time interval DLMO average midsleep prior week ( phase angle difference PAD ) . Mood assess throughout study use Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) well Beck Depression Inventory-II ( BDI-II ) Beck Anxiety Inventory ( BAI ) .</detailed_description>
