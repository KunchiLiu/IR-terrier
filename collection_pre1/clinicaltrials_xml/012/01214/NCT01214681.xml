	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer common disease worldwide . It think colorectal cancer cell arise stem cell genetic material regulating growth division stem cell become defective . This lead unregulated production cell turn defective genetic information cancer formation . Research colorectal cancer hamper fact study must take long time produce result large development cancer endpoint . Therefore alternative method quantify risk develop cancer require trial realistic size complete realistic time frame . The investigator previously identify several candidate 'biomarkers ' . The next stage prove disprove useful biomarkers test response dietary agent investigator know reduces risk colon cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project design enhance understand link food health gut . The particular purpose project investigate impact well-defined intervention human volunteer panel novel , establish , diet-related biomarkers bowel cancer risk . We develop number novel biomarkers diet-related CRC risk measure colo-rectal mucosal biopsy ( stool ) . These biomarkers include differentially expressed protein , DNA methylation marker inflammation marker . In on-going BORICC Study investigate relationship dietary exposure nutritional status biomarkers cross-sectional study . The next logical step research determine whether select panel promise biomarkers respond dietary intervention i.e . test utility biomarkers GI health potential surrogate endpoint future human study . We propose use Hi-maize 260 polydextrose ( PD ) model resistant starch ( RS ) intervention agent . RS describe fraction dietary starch digest small bowel flow colon substrate bacterial fermentation . ( Asp , 1996 ) PD produce bulk melt polycondensation glucose sorbitol produce oligosaccharide mean degree polymerisation 12 resistant mammalian GI enzymes , like RSs , substrate bacterial fermentation . ( Auerbach , 2007 ) Both Hi-maize PD ferment ( great lesser extent ) produce short-chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) include butyrate . ( Asp , 1996 ) Butyrate beneficial effect gut physiology immune function include anti-inflammatory effect . ( Wächtershäuser , 2000 ; Dronamraju , 2009 ) In present project investigate impact PD RS , food-borne substrate delivery butyrate , biomarkers bowel cancer risk .</detailed_description>
