	<brief_summary>Chromoendoscopy ( involve spray dye colonic mucosa ) combine magnification utilized polyp histology identification . Pit pattern surface polyp describe Kudo et al show high diagnostic accuracy differentiate polyp type ( 18 , 19 ) . NBI , also refer `` electronic chromoendoscopy '' another technique evaluate polyp histology identification highlight superficial mucosal vascular architecture ( 15 , 20 , 21 ) . pCLE another novel addition technology aim accomplish vivo histologic diagnosis high degree accuracy . The pCLE system three major component ( Mauna Kea Technologies , Paris , France ) . The first confocal miniprobe make approximately thirty thousand optical fiber bundle together terminate distal microsystem . The image obtain lateral resolution 1µm , axial resolution 10 µm maximum field view 240 µm . The depth observation 55 65 µm . The miniprobe tip diameter 2.5 mm pass accessory channel standard endoscope . The second laser scan unit ( excitation wavelength - 488 nm ) combine function laser light illumination rapid laser scanning , enable frame rate 12 image per second signal detection . The third control acquisition software real time image reconstruction , immediate sequence display post-procedure analysis editing tool . Once area interest ( e.g . polyp ) identify , 5 ml 10 % fluorescein sodium inject intravenously ; confocal probe pass accessory channel endoscope place lesion obtain several high-quality image video sequence . In study Buchner et al Mayo Clinic , Jacksonville , ( 22 ) system use evaluate confocal image 37 polyp 25 patient blinded fashion without knowledge histologic diagnosis endoscopic appearance . The investigator develop follow criterion suggestive neoplastic polyp : villiform pattern , nuclear characteristic - oval/irregular nuclear shape increase number nucleus . These feature sensitivity 82.6 % , specificity 92.9 % accuracy 86.5 % characterization neoplastic polyp . Similarly , Meining et al ( 23 ) also evaluate criterion differentiate neoplastic benign lesion colon encouraging result . The investigator hypothesize pCLE high rate accurate characterization polyp histology real time colonoscopy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Evaluating Colon Polyp Histology With Vivo Probe Based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct Kansas City VA Medical Center , Kansas City , MO . The investigator pCLE system investigator currently use multicenter study evaluate patient Barrett 's esophagus . Patients refer screen and/or surveillance colonoscopy prospectively enrol study . Inclusion criterion - referral screen and/or surveillance colonoscopy ability provide inform consent . Exclusion criterion : prior surgical resection portion colon , prior history colon cancer , history inflammatory bowel disease , use anti-platelet agent anticoagulant precludes removal polyps procedure , poor general condition reason avoid prolong procedure time , history polyposis syndrome HNPCC , inability give inform consent , inadequate bowel preparation , allergy fluorescein , pregnancy , renal insufficiency . Moderate sedation procedure administer standard fashion intravenous midazolam , meperidine fentanyl . This single arm study procedure perform standard white light colonoscope ( CF - H180AL , Olympus America ) . After cecal intubation , colonic mucosa carefully visualize withdrawal high-definition white light polyp detect , characteristic document : size , location , morphology [ Polypoid ( sessile , pedunculated ) Non-polypoid : ( superficial elevate , completely flat , depress ) ] . Then 5ml 10 % fluorescein sodium inject intravenously . Following pCLE probe pass biopsy channel colonoscope place polyp obtain confocal image video sequence . During initial phase unblinded comparison confocal image videos polyp histology ( 20 adenoma , 20 hyperplastic ) perform order evaluate criterion describe Mayo Jacksonville group ( 22 ) differentiate neoplastic non neoplastic polyp . Following initial phase , criterion apply prospective manner predict polyp histology ( 100 polyp ) real time procedure prior removal . Multiple confocal image videos polyp save appropriate labeling . Pathologists blind endoscopic pCLE finding polyp . Polyp size assess compare sheath polypectomy snare open span biopsy forceps . Photo documentation polyp perform . Polyps remove standard fashion biopsy forceps snare sent histopathological evaluation . Each polyp send separate jar label accordingly . The bowel preparation evaluate graded accord previously report criterion ( 24 ) : excellent , good , fair , inadequate . Patients inadequate bowel preparation exclude . Complications include gastrointestinal bleeding ( require intervention ) perforation record . Outcomes : The predicted histology polyp base confocal image videos correlation actual histology accuracy prediction primary outcome . Secondary outcome inter-observer variability polyp histology prediction base confocal image videos polyp ( kappa statistic ) .</detailed_description>
