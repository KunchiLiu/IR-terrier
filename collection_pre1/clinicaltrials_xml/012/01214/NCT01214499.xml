	<brief_summary>Coronary disease one frequent pathology modern world lead cause death investigator country . In Spain 50.000 coronary percutaneous intervention 5.000 coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) procedure perform every year . Despite data 12 % patient diffuse coronary disease candidate conventional therapy . Also 15-25 % patient undergoing coronary bypass graft receive incomplete revascularization due poor quality coronary vessel . Transmyocardial revascularization ( TMR ) surgical procedure use laser create channel myocardial , laser stimulates local angiogenesis provide blood ischemic area . Results procedure show clear benefit term reduction angina increase survival patient , compare medical treatment . Cell therapy heart disease offer recent year encourage result despite methodological difficulty able use technique sometimes involve . The basis lie potential ability stem cell differentiate type adult cell . In case cardiac cell therapy , stem cell differentiate myocardial cell vascular cell capable develop angiogenesis . Further study need draw firm conclusion clinical impact use stem cell cardiovascular disease . Recently system develop create , time simple effective way , laser channel introduction stem cell edge channel . This system call PHOENIX â„¢ consist laser probe capable create transmural channel myocardium . Based explain , quite possible combination therapy increase successful result regard reduction angina patient need . Initially , experience type treatment , result could analyze compare result obtain laser therapy , help control clinical trial , one investigator propose .</brief_summary>
