	<criteria>1 . Patient clinical diagnosis epilepsy require additional evaluation epilepsy monitoring unit ( EMU ) . 2 . Patient likely require EMU evaluation period least 3 day . 3 . In opinion Principal Investigator , Patient likely 3 5 seizure EMU stay . 4 . Patient currently take least one antiepileptic medication . 5 . Patients must 18 year old may either sex race . 6 . Patient must good general health , fully ambulatory , able complete physical aspect test requirement . 7 . Patient must willing able complete inform consent HIPAA authorization . 8 . Patient diagnose epilepsy may also experience pseudo seizure psychogenic seizure . 1 . Patients severe psychiatric disease investigator 's judgment would prevent patient 's successful completion study . 2 . Patients experience status epileptic within last 6 month . 3 . Patients cardiovascular , respiratory , neuromuscular gait disorder investigator 's judgment would cause unnecessary risk . 4 . Patients prescribed drug specifically cardiac autonomic disorder investigator 's opinion would affect heart rate response . Drugs secondary cardiac autonomic action allow . 5 . Patients cardiovascular arrhythmias cardiac disease would preclude ability detect intrinsic change heart rate due exercise , stress , seizure . This would include limited chronic atrial fibrillation permanent cardiac pacemaker implantation . 6 . Patients currently dependent alcohol narcotic drug define DSM IVR . 7 . Patients history psychogenic seizure pseudo seizure . 8 . Women pregnant . Women childbearing age must take pregnancy test .</criteria>
