	<detailed_description>Introduction Embryo transfer failure define ≥3 IVF-embryo transfer failure without pregnancy . In spite transfer 3 good quality embryo , 20-30 % woman undergo IVF achieve ongoing pregnancy . There multiple factor influence IVF-failure . Autoantibodies may one possible cause IVF-failure , especially unexplained mechanical infertility . In study , antiphospholipid antibody consider causative factor implantation embryo failure . However investigator show combination therapy heparin/aspirin woman positive antiphospholipid antibody effective improve IVF-outcome . In prospective study confirm association antiphospholipid antibody abnormality IVF-failure . Recently relationship thrombophilia IVF implantation failure . The effect unfractionated heparin assist reproductive technology ( ART ) cycle prevention thrombosis implantation site . Although effect restrict anticoagulation also modulate apposition , adhesion , penetration embryo . Other advantage decrease thrombophilic risk COH ( control ovarian hyperstimulation ) cycle administration gonadotrophin . So heparin make good pregnancy rate repeat IVF-ET failure There study regard heparin effect IVF cycle outcome . The purpose study evaluation unfractionated heparin effect improvement ART outcome . Materials &amp; Methods This study prospective randomize control trial ass whether administration unfractionated heparin would increase implantation pregnancy rate woman repeat ET-IVF failure . The study perform reproduction center affiliate medical university . A total 86 patient candidate IVF/ICSI history three pervious IVF-ET failure enrol study . The study approve ethic committee Research Clinical Center Infertility affiliate Yazd Medical University Medical Sciences . All patient require sign write consent provision complete information . Treatment protocol All patient treat long protocol ovarian stimulation . For pituitary suppression regulation , patient treat daily administration 0.5 mg buserelin subcutaneous day 21 previous menstrual cycle . When desensitization occur , evidence plasma E2 level ≤ 50 pg/ml absence ovarian cyst transvaginal ultrasound examination , buserelin reduce 0.25 mg/day continue day hCG administration . The COH initiate recombinant FSH HMG 150 IU/day day 2 menstrual cycle . Ovarian response monitor serial ultrasound examination evaluation serum E2 level , gonadotropin dos adjustment do require . Urinary HCG 10000 IU administer ≥3 follicle 18 mm . Oocyte retrieval perform 34-36 hour hCG injection IVF ICSI perform . one three top-quality embryo transfer 48 hour oocyte retrieval ultrasound guidance , CCD embryo transfer catheter . At time , patient ( n=86 ) randomize two group use computer-generated randomization . Group A ( n=43 ) include patient receive unfractionated heparin 5000 IU twice day subcutaneous injection . Treatment start day embryo transfer 14 day ET . If β-hCG positive , unfractionated heparin continue 6 week postpartum . Group B ( n=43 ) receive antithrombotic drug . Luteal phase support start administration progesterone 100 mg daily intramuscular day oocyte retrieval two group continue documentation fetal heart activity ultrasound .</detailed_description>
