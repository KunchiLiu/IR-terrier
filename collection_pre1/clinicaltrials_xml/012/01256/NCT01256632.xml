	<detailed_description>This open-label study , intravitreally administer Ranibizumab eye Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) , specifically look correlation presence Posterior Vitreous Detachment ( PVD ) number intravitreal injection Ranibizumab require . 40 subject office Vision Research Foundation enrol study . Subjects assign either Posterior Vitreous Detachment ( PVD ) positive group Posterior Vitreous Detachment ( PVD ) negative group base pre-treatment ultrasound . A maximum 20 subject group enrol . Subject accrual trial expect complete within 6 month . All study eye receive 0.5mg , intravitreous monthly injection Ranibizumab , four initial dos , ( Day 0 , Month 1 , Month 2 , Month 3 ) , schedule follow-up visit monthly 12 month . Re-treatment first 4 injection , need basis , base predefined criterion . Eyes evaluate full ocular examination , visual acuity measurement ( ETDRS chart distance 4 meter ) , OCT , FA , Fundus Photos , B-scan Ultrasound subject adverse event monitoring .</detailed_description>

Clear ocular medium adequate papillary dilation permit good quality stereoscopic fundus photography Ability return study visit Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) lactation Premenopausal woman use adequate contraception . The following consider effective mean contraception : surgical sterilization use oral contraceptive , barrier contraception either condom diaphragm conjunction spermicidal gel , IUD , contraceptive hormone implant patch . Patients form prior eye treatment AMD include : Photodynamic Therapy , antiVEGF Therapy , Laser , Vitreoretinal surgery Had ocular surgery within past 60 day study eye Concurrent use two therapy glaucoma Uncontrolled glaucoma study eye ( defined intraocular pressure &gt; 30mm Hg despite treatment antiglaucoma medication ) Concurrent use systemic antiVEGF agent Has active infection study eye ( ) Inability obtain photographs document CNV Has receive investigational therapy within 60 day prior study entry Patients significantly compromise visual acuity study eye due concomitant ocular condition . Has condition investigator considers sound reason exclusion ( e.g. , lack motivation , history poor compliance , concomitant illness , personality disorder , mental condition , drug abuse , use neuroleptic , physical social condition predict difficulty longterm followup ) . Has allergy sodium fluorescein dye Inability comply study followup procedure</criteria>
