	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional cohort study exudative age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) patient seven year initiation intravitreal ranibizumab regimen treatment arm pivotal ANCHOR MARINA study , subsequent follow HORIZON Study . While MARINA ANCHOR study establish benefit ranibizumab 2 year , many patient U.S. undergone treatment many year , longer-term outcome chronic disease remain unknown . Despite early hope limited duration treatment , subsequent clinical experience suggest many patient require continued treatment . The patient population study unique , patient treatment arm MARINA ANCHOR early treat patient , provide longest-term data available AMD patient receive ranibizumab . Patients recall study evaluate provide update current visual acuity , disease activity status , anatomic characteristic , genotype . There single study visit extend clinical history perform vision test , ophthalmologic examination , retinal imaging study , include high-resolution spectral-domain OCT fundus autofluorescence imaging , technology unavailable time original ANCHOR MARINA Trials . Genetic analysis perform know AMD risk gene well candidate gene study genotypic profile associate AMD disease progression long-term treatment response . Understanding course 7-plus year current generation AMD treatment serve physicians ongoing management chronic disease .</detailed_description>
