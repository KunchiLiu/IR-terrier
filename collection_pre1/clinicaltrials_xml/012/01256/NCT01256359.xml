	<brief_summary>This randomise , double-blind placebo control phase 2 trial . Patient randomly assign 1:1 2 treatment arm . They receive either docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV placebo give bd , AZD6244 75mg bd daily docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV . Docetaxel administer every 3 week maximum 6 cycle , AZD6244/placebo may continue beyond , disease progression . The objective ass whether combination AZD6244 docetaxel worthy evaluation definitive randomise study , null hypothesis combination activity similar docetaxel alone population . After consent obtain mutational analysis tumour BRAF perform archival tumour tissue , information already know , assess eligibility study . If archival tissue fresh biopsy request patient . A blood sample also take future genetic analysis . Once take part trial patient need attend oncology unit regularly monitoring delivery treatment . Patients undergo complete physical examination screening , C1D1 , C1D8 , C1D15 , C2D1 , C2D8 day 1 every subsequent cycle . Blood haematology , biochemistry clot take visit . A 12 lead ECG perform screen . Disease assessment CT scan use modify RECIST criterion 9 18 week , every 3 month disease progression .</brief_summary>
