	<brief_summary>Anti-VEGF therapy proven efficacious wet ( neovascular ) form macular degeneration may beneficial treatment choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) due cause . The limitation type treatment necessity frequent intraocular injection . The purpose study determine use anti-VEGF therapy combination photodynamic therapy reduce number treatment need monotherapy achieve similar visual result . There ongoing multicenter trial evaluate combination therapy patient wet AMD similar trial patient CNV due non-AMD cause . Therefore , study investigator focus patient CNV due AMD .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Ability provide write informed consent comply study assessment full duration study . Age &gt; 18 year Clinical diagnosis choroidal neovascularization secondary following cause : ocular histoplasmosis , toxoplasmosis , idiopathic , angioid streak , choroidal rupture , intraocular inflammation ( without sign active uveitis i.e . multifocal choroiditis ) , central serous retinopathy pathologic Myopia . Only one eye assess study . If eye eligible , investigator patient determine eye treat , consider factor disease duration , likelihood response treatment .
