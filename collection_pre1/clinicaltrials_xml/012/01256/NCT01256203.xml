	<brief_summary>Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) use combination drug , porfimer sodium , light non heat laser . The activation drug do illuminate abnormal area use fiber optic device . The fiber optic device fine fiber ( like fish line ) permit transmission light . By , porfimer sodium inactive . However become active put presence light source sunlight , intense indoor light , laser . Therefore , main risk therapy skin sensitive light , sensibility last 90 day . The skin reaction similar sunburn call phototoxicity . To date , product market show protection visible light , therefore , product demonstrate protect skin phototoxicity visible light . A sunscreen sell brand name Solar Protection Formula® SPF 60 United States contain ingredient provide maximum ultraviolet ( UV ) protection , well formulation could provide visible light protection . The product could potentially prevent skin phototoxicity due visible light , frequently report side effect patient receive PDT porfimer sodium . Therefore , study design ass efficacy topical application Solar Protection Formula® SPF 60 skin protector visible light-induced skin redness swell follow injection porfimer sodium . It involve 17 20 human subject United States PDT porfimer sodium plan treatment high-grade dysplasia Barrett 's esophagus ( pre-cancerous change food pipe tissue ) , lung cancer , cancer esophagus ( food pipe ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human subject plan PDT course evaluate confirm eligibility . Prior enrollment , inclusion exclusion criterion verify . Medical procedure include demographic information ( age , sex , race , smoke drink habit ) , medical/surgical history , physical exam ( include vital sign , body weight , height , skin color ) , clinical laboratory testing , concomitant medication intake therapy use collect . The study procedures begin intravenous injection porfimer sodium . Skin photobiological test consist four 2-day period perform three month injection porfimer sodium dose 2 mg/kg body weight . Each period include Skin Illumination session Skin Evaluation session . During Skin Illumination session , Solar Protection Formula® SPF 60 randomly apply dose 2 mg/cm² skin subunit area back 30 minute illumination . A second skin subunit use `` no-treatment '' observational area . Therefore , subject her/his control . Illumination perform use visible light source . During Skin Evaluation session , skin reaction score outcome assessor 24 hour illumination accord pre-determined rating scale . The outcome assessor blind active treatment sequence application . All subject follow three month .</detailed_description>
