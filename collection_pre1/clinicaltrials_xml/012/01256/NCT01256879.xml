	<brief_summary>The purpose research see non-drug ingredient capsule oral solution affect well drug absorb . This call `` bioequivalence . '' Medications take mouth , capsule solution , need absorb body order good . Capsules solution contain drug , also contain non-drug ingredient call excipients filler . Excipients capsules solution impact much drug absorb body . This call `` bioINequivalence . '' Capsules solution research contain drug cimetidine . This drug use since high water solubility ( dissolve water ) low ability absorb .</brief_summary>
