Analysis : Preliminary data analysis include descriptive statistic scatter plot examine distribution outcome time point , well covariate interest . Although randomization scheme ensure balance baseline variable two arm ( due chance alone ) , estimate standardize magnitude baseline difference well correlation baseline variable outcome interest 10 week 15 week objectively determine baseline variable need estimate unbiased effect intervention outcome . The primary analysis base intent treat approach investigate effect intervention continuous outcomes 10 week 15 week . In particular , Analysis Covariance model use adjusts treatment arm baseline level outcome variable . Such model allow u estimate effect intervention outcome , adjust baseline outcome.In addition , linear mixed model use determine effect intervention outcome 10 week differs effect intervention outcome 15 week . If need , analysis repeat use as-treated approach . All analysis perform use two-sided significance 0.05 .</detailed_description>
