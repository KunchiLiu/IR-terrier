	<brief_summary>Sleep-wake dysregulation disturbance roughly 24-hour cycle circadian rhythm . Well known disorder present sleep-wake dysregulation seasonal affective disorder , jet lag shift work . These people experience serious mood change season change . When day-night rhythm desynchronize , sleep disturbance , little energy , often feel depressed . An establish intervention treat disorder bright light therapy . Light therapy use affective disorder shift worker , jet lag symptomatology advance delay desynchronize rhythms.Two proxy measure sleep-wake dysregulation sleep quality daytime sleepiness . It known cross sectional study renal transplant ( RTx ) recipients prevalence 30 % 62 % poor sleep quality measure self report ; prevalence impair daytime function 34 % 12 prevalence depressive symptomatology 20 % 22 % . Sleep-wake dysregulation chronically ill population risk factor morbidity mortality . RTx nurse follow-up care frontline recipient 's symptom respectively problem . The psychosocial variable address , association morbidity mortality sleep , daytime functioning , adherence immunosuppressive medication , exercise , smoke depressive symptomatology . In follow research project address follow gap : fact nature sleep disturbance RTx recipient never assess , prevalence available sleep-wake dysregulation data bright light therapy intervention RTx recipient . Hypothesis : Renal transplant recipient sleep wake disregulation improve sleep quality less daytime sleepiness 21 day light therapy .</brief_summary>
