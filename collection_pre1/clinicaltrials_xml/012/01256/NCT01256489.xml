	<brief_summary>The propose study intend test idea , base upon current knowledge biology physiology corneal ulceration SJS/TENS patient receive keratoprosthesis , know effect infliximab matrix metalloproteinases , infliximab therapy patient may reduce likelihood corneal ulceration , hence extend period prosthesis retention vision recovery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infliximab Improve Retention Boston Keratoprosthesis Patients After Stevens Johnson Syndrome/ Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis ( SJS/TENS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The closely related disorder , Stevens Johnson Syndrome ( SJS ) Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis Syndrome ( TENS ) , represent rare severe hypersensitivity response systemic medication , cause severe slough skin mucous membrane . Approximately half affected patient experience ocular involvement , lead corneal opacity vascularization , patient , blindness . Corneal transplantation ( corneal allograft ) typically unsuccessful SJS/TENS , chronic inflammation ocular surface , lead corneal neovascularization opacity , tissue melt , ulceration , perforation . The Boston keratoprosthesis , artificial cornea develop Massachusetts Eye Ear Infirmary ( MEEI ) last 40 year , FDA approve device patient corneal blindness amenable corneal transplantation , restore sight thousand patient , SJS/TENS patient remain associated tissue melt ( tissue ulceration ) , perforation , ultimately , loss eye . K-Pro surgery currently best option patient SJS TENS corneal blindness , patient also worst prognosis surgery . While outcomes surgery patient SJS TENS improve dramatically past ten year , still unsatisfactory . Remicade® use small group patient SJS TENS undergo K-Pro surgery , one remarkable success . The purpose study explore treatment fully . For case report detail use infliximab one patient , see follow article : Dohlman JG , Foster CS , Dohlman CH . `` Boston Keratoprosthesis Stevens-Johnson Syndrome : A case use infliximab prevent tissue necrosis . '' Digital Journal Ophthalmology . 2009 , Volume 15 , Number 1 . Recently develop biologics dramatically improve functional outcome quality life patient autoimmune disease . One agent , infliximab , act block TNF alpha , protein associate tissue melt cornea , increasingly use autoimmune eye condition , addition FDA approve indication recalcitrant rheumatoid arthritis . The propose study determine feasibility combine infliximab keratoprosthesis surgery , closely monitor patient episode corneal melting : primary outcome study .</detailed_description>
