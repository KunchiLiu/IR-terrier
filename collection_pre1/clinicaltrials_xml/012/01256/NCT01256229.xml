	<brief_title>Outcomes In Children With Developmental Delay And Deafness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomized clinical trial . Deaf child ( parent guardian ) meet criterion developmental delay ( well inclusion exclusion criterion ) randomly assign receive either hearing aid ( group 1 ) cochlear implant ( group 2 ) follow longitudinally two year . If one intervention provide improved development quality life , study provide essential evidence support clinical decision-making population . Children normal cognition undergo cochlear implantation study control cohort ( group 3 ) order demonstrate extent gain cochlear implantation child developmental delay parallel gain see child without developmental delay . There placebo group . Specific aim 1 : We compare change development group . If hypothesis true , auditory , linguistic , cognitive development demonstrate improvement deaf child developmental delay treat cochlear implantation compare treat hear aid . Specific aim 2 : We compare change quality life group . If hypothesis true , quality life demonstrate improvement patient treat cochlear implantation compare treat hear aid . Screening perform Principal Investigator ( PI ) , collaborator , research staff Children 's Hearing Center Lucile Packard Children 's Hospital ( LPCH ) . In order minimize investigator selection bias attempt produce study group comparable , randomize study . Randomization guarantee comparable study group , particularly small trial like . In order improve odds achieve comparable study group , elect stratify randomization process age . Also , block randomization process use . Lastly , compare group end study look baseline assessment data stratify analysis . Thus , patient developmental delay randomize one two group baseline assessment . This randomization occur specific process order assure unbiased . Outcome variable : Four general outcomes measure baseline , one year intervention , two year intervention . The first three reflect measure development ( auditory , linguistic , cognitive ; specific aim 1 ) last one quality life ( specific aim 2 ) . All data collection perform routine clinic appointment require special appointment . All test administer either English Spanish , depend patient 's parent 's primary language . We bilingual audiology , speech pathology , psychology personnel center specifically purpose . For self-report questionnaire , Spanish-interpreter provide hospital use translate write material Spanish version test available . If parent able read questionnaire ( 5th grade level ) , read test personnel . 1 . Auditory development assess cochlear implant audiologists use two different technique . Behavioral threshold speech assess accord standard clinical audiological guideline . While child hear one cochlear implant localize sound ( two ear require ) , typically demonstrate behavioral response indicate cortical perception sound . Thus , data provide information regard ability child hear sound generate change behavior . As well , auditory-evoked brainstem response ( ABR ) electrically-evoked compound action potential ( eCAP ) threshold measure patient wear hear aid cochlear implant , respectively . These data also collect accord standard clinical guideline . 2 . Linguistic development assess standardized speech language test well Systematic Analysis Language Transcripts ( SALT ) coding . The standardized test include Preschool Language Scale ( PLS ) Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test ( PPVT ) . All test perform cochlear implant speech pathologist accord standard clinical guideline already routinely conduct PLS PPVT clinic . The PLS use patient minimal vocabulary , typically young child , validate birth 6 year , 11 month age . In contrast , PPVT useful old child vocabulary . It validate child old 2 year , 6 month age . Another way propose study language use language transcript ( SALT ) coding . One benefit technique permit test adapt child 's ability . Thus , follow-up speech language data every patient . Importantly , technique use previously assess effect mild-moderate hearing loss deafness language development . We videotape 30 minute session child one speech therapists . This perform within speech therapy room design videotape pediatric patient . The session organize speech therapist showcase child 's language abilities accord standard clinical guideline . These include administration vocabulary test either narrative sample conversation expository sample . The videotape cod patient identifier send collaborator expertise infant child language development perform independent analysis tape use SALT cod . The measure cod include Number Different Words ( NDW ) , Total Number word ( TNW ) , Mean Length Utterance ( MLU ) , nonverbal indicator comprehension ( e.g. , via point eyegaze ) . SALT cod videotape assess verbal non-verbal communication . 3 . Cognitive level assess via standardized testing . The Mullen Scales Early Learning ( MSEL ) ( Pearson , Bloomington , MN ) objective measure design young child estimate intelligence . The age range Mullen birth 5 year , 8 month , though also use old child significant cognitive impairment include study . Items administer test load onto 5 different domain ( Visual Reception , Gross Motor , Fine Motor , Expressive Language , Receptive Language ) . Because verbal nonverbal domain assess separately , measure particularly useful assessment child suspect language delay and/or hearing loss . We perform complete test analyze change domain ( i.e . measure intervention ) . The raw score use order sensitivity detecting change patient MR otherwise would tend low end percentile range . The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales ( VABS ) ( Pearson , Bloomington , MN ) provide measure child 's adaptive functioning . This describe child 's ability cope function effectively within environment . This measure structure parent interview perform caregiver child birth adulthood . In entirety , measure provide information regard child 's functioning across several domain include Communication , Socialization , Motor Skills , Daily Living Skills . We perform complete test analyze change subscore ( i.e . measure intervention ) . It important note psychological test give highly-trained pediatric psychologist proper environment . The rationale precaution minimize investigator bias . The neurocognitive data collect single 3-4 hour visit psychologist , also measure variable prior intervention part Baseline Assessment . Because test always take place Psychology Service likelihood examiner , variability minimize . 4 . Quality life assess use three standardized technique . The Parenting Stress Index ( PSI ) identify factor increase stress child-parent system accord parental perception . We substantial experience use test measure use cochlear implant patient last several year . The parental response score interpreted psychologist . The CARE-Index also measure help consultant originally develop CARE-Index tremendous experience . This involve videotape analyze 3-5 minute `` free play '' interaction mother child . The recording later cod maternal attentiveness , infant responsiveness dyadic interaction use 14-point sensitivity scale CARE-Index . Intervention : The intervention study participant perform dedicated cochlear implant audiologists cochlear implant hearing aid program trial . These highly-trained pediatric audiologists skilled manage child complex severe hearing loss . Thus , quality intervention high level , whether cochlear implant hearing aid . Patients group 1 fit bilateral hearing aid . These program individually severity frequency distribution hearing loss . The type hearing aid use fit appropriate fashion accord standard audiometric criterion clinic norm . Patients group 2 3 undergo cochlear implantation . According Food Drug Administration guideline , occur reach 12 month age , unless extenuate situation exists . As well , appropriate vaccination place prior surgery , per guideline Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) . Initially , implant one ear . This current standard care many insurance company pay . The choice ear make individual basis , determine per routine cochlear implant team . This choice depend anatomy inner ear auditory nerve level residual hearing ear . As well , factor handedness child , tendency child rest head one side , parental desire also occasionally play decision . If family desire second implant place contralateral ear , work insurance company try arrange . Patients three group require frequent follow-up visit audiology clinic device programming . Typically , visit frequent patient cochlear implant hearing aid , always . The schedule appointment make individual basis child need frequent change device program others . If hearing aid mold need polish re-made child grows , perform per clinic routine . If cochlear implant software hardware need updated new technology emerges , occur per clinic routine . Thus , patient receive high level care accord current standard . Lost damaged equipment replace . As well , patient three group undergo thorough counsel hearing loss , communication strategy . Contact child 's teacher , therapist , caregiver make effort organize comprehensive strategy regular communication therapy . As routine , every patient offer opportunity supplementary weekly auditory therapy session one speech pathologists part cochlear implant team one satellite speech pathology clinic . Our speech pathologist provide auditory-verbal therapy ( AVT ) , although typically modify therapy structure meet need individual child . Just audiology service , speech pathology service high level quality child group . However , note many family choose obtain speech therapy service program . Instead , matter convenience , family choose therapy home free/low cost Early Childhood Intervention ( ECI ) service local school district . The amount time hear aid cochlear implant use amount quality therapy assess regular phone call . Every three month study coordinator call parents/caregiver ask four question : - Have complication hear aid cochlear implant last three month ( i.e . ear infection , ear drainage , meningitis ) , , therapy need complication ? - How many hour per day hearing aid cochlear implant leave child ? - How many hour per week child communication therapy ( defined auditory , speech , language therapy ) child receive ? - How many hour per week non-communication therapy ( defined physical , occupational , cognitive therapy ) child receive ? These data record database . The reason ask question identify adverse event related intervention help identify reason one intervention may work good bad . For example , decrease benefit might expect child treat hearing aid continuously get chronic ear drainage plug hear aid badly leave time child treat cochlear implant get meningitis . Alternatively , receive cochlear implant increase enthusiasm parent participate therapy , may increase benefit . We also ask participant willing contact regard future research study may interest .</detailed_description>
