	<detailed_description>Design In multi-center phase III trial , untreated patient diagnose AL candidate stem cell transplant melphalan 200 mg/m2 target population . Patients eligible SCT melphalan 200 mg/m2 decline undergo transplantation enrol study subgroup stratify randomization . Because many newly diagnose AL patient present limited organ reserve , eligibility criterion take consideration impact cardiac involvement overall survival use cardiac biomarker stag . Stage I II patient eligible . Stage III patient enrol ancillary phase II study . Eligible patient stratify cardiac stage I stage II randomize receive MDex BMDex . Intervention Untreated patient AL amyloidosis offer treatment study . After screen find eligible , patient stratify base cardiac stage stage I stage II . Thresholds cTnT , cTnI , NT-proBNP &lt; 0.035 microg/L , &lt; 0.1 microg/L , &lt; 332 ng/L respectively . For stage I patient cTnT cTnI NT-proBNP threshold . For stage II patient either troponin NT-proBNP threshold . Patients eligible SCT melphalan 200 mg/m2 decline transplant consider additional stratum randomize separately . Thus , follow stratum : 0.patients eligible SCT melphalan 200 mg/m2 decline transplant , 1. cardiac stage I , 2. cardiac stage II . After stratification , patient randomize receive either A : MDex : oral melphalan 0.22 mg/kg dexamethasone 40 mg daily 4 consecutive day every 28 day ( MDex ) B : BMDex : cycle 1 2 = MDex bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 i.v . day 1 , 4 , 8 11 28 day cycle , cycle 3 - 8 = MDex bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 i.v . day 1 , 8 , 15 22 35 day cycle . Treatment start within 2 week randomization . Treatment continue - completion MDex cycle 9 BMDex cycle 8 - achievement complete hematologic response cycle 6 - achievement partial hematologic response organ response cycle 6 - less partial hematologic response cycle 3 - progression clonal plasma cell disease . On first day new treatment cycle bortezomib dose , patient evaluate possible toxicity may occur previous dose ( ) . Toxicities assess accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) , version 4.0 . Dose modification delay make base toxicity experience previous cycle therapy newly encounter Day 1 cycle . Dose reduction step present . The start new cycle delay weekly basis ( maximum 3 week ) recovery toxicity level allow continuation therapy . Delay new cycle 3 week occur clear clinical benefit observe . Otherwise , delay start new cycle 3 week due insufficient recovery toxicity , subject discontinue study drug procedure perform outlined End Treatment Visit Schedule Events . During treatment , prophylactic medication include acyclovir 400 mg twice daily dose adjusted renal function , ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice day day 1-7 cycle , proton-pump inhibitor . Supportive measure use . Patients see clinic physician prior begin cycle therapy .</detailed_description>
