	<brief_summary>Dexamethasone potent synthetic member corticosteroid . It give cancer patient undergo chemotherapy counteract emetic side effect essential drug chemotherapy-treated patient . Hiccup common adverse effect corticosteroid especially dexamethasone vary 3 % 60 % give patient . Discontinuance dexamethasone relieve hiccup case , vomiting/nausea rate increase . It clear whether hiccup side effect limit dexamethasone corticosteroid group . Methylprednisolone , synthetic corticosteroid similar dexamethasone , could consider antiemetic agent patient receive chemotherapy . The investigator perform pilot study hypothesis replace dexamethasone methylprednisolone could maintain antiemetic role prevent hiccup .</brief_summary>
