	<brief_summary>Women Breast Cancer respond chemotherapy may undergo month treatment little change tumor size overall outcome . The Researchers demonstrate previously undescribed `` metabolic flare '' response observe early neoadjuvant treatment breast cancer patient . The research determine flare predictive overall therapy response due inflammatory reaction cell death induce cytotoxic therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting Pathological Response Within 1st Week Chemotherapy Using Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging device measure predict marker response first week chemo-therapy . The oxyhemoglobin flare response predictive overall pathological response chemotherapy human subject . These vascular change indicate rapid transient increase decrease oxyhemoglobin concentration first hour day therapeutic administration . The magnitude time course flare response patient receive cytotoxic therapy differ pathological responder non-responders . This oxyhemoglobin `` flare response '' observe In tumor vascular dynamic intact .</detailed_description>
