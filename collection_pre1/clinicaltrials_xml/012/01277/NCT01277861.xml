	<brief_summary>The investigator plan test hypothesis pretreatment fentanyl prior induction anesthesia would result reduce incidence movement airway response desflurane patient breathe spontaneously laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) . The primary aim study assess effect fentanyl pretreatment incidence movement induction anesthesia . Secondary aim study evaluate effect titration fentanyl accord respiratory rate incidence intraoperative respiratory event cough , breath hold laryngospasm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtain approval institutional review board inform consent , 100 patient , 18-64 year age , schedule elective superficial peripheral surgery le 2 h duration would enrol prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients randomly assign one two anesthetic technique accord computer-generated random number table . Patients receive either fentanyl saline prior induction anesthesia , rest anesthetic analgesic technique standardize patient . Exclusion criterion include obesity ( body mass index &gt; 30 ) , pregnancy , history gastroesophageal reflux , hiatal hernia , significant cardiovascular , pulmonary ( e.g. , reactive airway disease ) , hepatic , renal , neurologic , metabolic , endocrine disease well history alcohol drug abuse well require tracheal intubation . After premedication midazolam 2 mg , patient transfer operating room . On arrival operating room standard monitor BIS ( BiSpectral Index ) monitor apply . Patients preoxygenated 2-3 minute 100 % oxygen , follow administration either fentanyl 1 µg/kg ( make 10 ml saline ) 10 ml saline ( prepared person involve study ) . Induction anesthesia perform 2-3 minute administration study drug propofol 2.0 - 2.5 mg/kg lidocaine 2 % 20-30 mg. After loss eyelash reflex appropriate size LMA place . If patient become apneic , manual ventilation perform oxygen/nitrous oxide desflurane , 3 % dialed concentration initially titrate maintain BIS value 50-60 . Anesthesia maintain desflurane titrate achieve BIS value 50-60 , along 50 % nitrous oxide oxygen . Once spontaneous breathe resume , fentanyl 25-50 µg administer achieve respiratory rate 10-15 breaths/minute . Additional propofol/fentanyl administer , deem necessary attend anesthesiologist . All patient receive dexamethasone 4 mg , IV induction anesthesia ondansetron 4 mg 20-30 minute prior end surgery . Desflurane discontinue closure surgical wound . A blinded observer record patient demographic ( age , weight , height ) history smoke preoperative evaluation . Data collect intraoperative period include need manual ventilation duration manual ventilation , duration anesthesia , total dos propofol fentanyl , time discontinuation desflurane patient first follow verbal command well heart rate ( HR ) , mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) , end-tidal carbon dioxide , oxygen saturation , end-tidal gas concentration record every 15 minute . Data collect postoperative period include verbal rating score ( 0 10 ) use ass pain , nausea , vomit recovery room every 15 minute one hour well need rescue medication also record . Patients also contact approximately 24 hour surgery evaluate post operative course include occurrence adverse event . The patient remain study approximately 24 hour .</detailed_description>
