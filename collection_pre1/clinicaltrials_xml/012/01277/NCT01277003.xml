	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) common compressive focal mononeuropathy see clinical practice . Patients commonly experience constellation symptom complex bring compression median nerve traverse carpal tunnel . When compression nerve occur , ischemia mechanical disruption nerve function may result . Pathological analysis show constellation nerve injury . Until , satisfactory conservative treatment method . Local steroid injection oral steroid may result initial relief , relapse frequent much side effect , preclude routine use CTS . Full time wrist splint claim effective , compromise hand function daily activity . There reasonable study show relief pain acupuncture diverse pain condition . However therapeutic efficacy acupuncture CTS less convincing past . Until recent decade , case report prospective study report therapeutic effect acupuncture CTS . Other study also report low-level laser microamperes transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) effective improvement clinical outcome patient CTS . Another report suggest TENS consider treatment painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy . Therefore , investigator perform study evaluate effect Aculife Magnetic Wave Therapist ( battery operate device probe electrode contain magnetic element transform oscillate current electromagnetic wave stimulate acupuncture point , simulate effect electroacupuncture ) CTS compare Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) . After least 4 week treatment ( least 16 treatment session ) therapeutic effect evaluate comparison symptom severity score , electrophysiological study , sonographic morphology study magnetic resonance imaging study , treatment , different group .</brief_summary>
