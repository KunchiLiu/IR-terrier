	<detailed_description>Residents LTC facility Saskatoon Health Region Regina Qu'Appelle Region recruit . Inclusion criterion : Male female resident able follow simple instruction , ambulate without walk aid least 10 meter , willing participate study procedure eligible participate study . Exclusion criterion : Residents experience recent cardiovascular event ( within past 6 month ) severe arthritis , cardiac instability , vestibular disorder , uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled epilepsy , recent fracture ( past 4 month ) , recent admission acute care facility ( past 4 month ) , schedule surgery hospitalization next 6 month participate another regular exercise program ( three time per week ) aim improve balance strength exclude study . Based sample size calculation , sample size 129 participant provide ample power repeat measure analysis . Data collect additional 50 participant order deal possibility attrition . Thus , total sample size 179 participant . The investigator meet LTC facility ' administrator staff inform study , inclusion exclusion criterion , study procedure intervention . They provide copy one page information form include space resident ( substitute medical decision-maker , appropriate ) indicate sign consent approach research staff detail information ( Appendix ) . Staff provide form potential/eligible subject , collect form complete . Subjects consent contacted research staff provide detailed information study research coordinator . If resident agreement , give write consent enter study . The consent include write permission researcher consult subject 's family physician subject 's health , ensure optimization vitamin D intake prior enrollment . Although subject may cognitive problem , majority subject clearly competent provide consent . However , subject may advance cognitive problem others may therefore fully appreciate consequence participation . In situation person normally provide consent medical treatment provide appropriate consent . When capacity provide full , informed consent clear , subject substitute decision-maker ask sign consent form . 6 . Procedures : Step 1 : Baseline assessment . All participant regardless group undergo follow assessment . The assessment outcome measure conduct train study personnel blind group allocation . 1 . The Senior Fitness Test ( SFT ) . The SFT , six-item battery include measure dynamic upper low extremity strength flexibility , aerobic endurance , dynamic balance agility complete ) . 2 . The Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) . The BBS , tool currently use RRMC , 14-item battery intend objectively assess person 's ability safely perform several common daily living task . 3 . Grip Strength . Grip strength dominant non-dominant hand-held dynamometer measure . Strength test 3 time hand maximum score record . 4 . Gait speed ( 6 metre walk test ) . Participants ask walk distance 6 metre portable , computerized walkway ( GAITRiteÂ® system . An additional two metre walk add begin end walkway accommodate acceleration deceleration . Subjects ask walk along walkway . Gait parameter , include gait speed , record . 5 . OARS Physical Activities Daily Living ( PADL ) Sub-Scale . The OARS-PADL brief , valid , reliable instrument use clinical assessment functional status . The OARS-PADL complete research assistant information provide subject ' care provider . 6 . Cornell Scale Depression Dementia ( CSDD ) . Mood assess use CSDD , well- validate , scale ( base caregiver report ) design assessment depression individual dementia individual reside long-term care . The CSDD complete research assistant information provide subject ' care provider . 7 . The Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) short form also use assess self-identified depressive symptom study . 8 . Revised Memory Behavior Problems Checklist ( RMBPC ) . Behavioral problem assess use RMBPC , 24-item report measure observable behavioral memory problem . The RMBPC complete research assistant information provide subject ' care provider . 9 . Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire ( SPMSQ ) . 10 . Coloured Analogue Pain Scale use assess pain via patient self-report . 11 . Height , weight body measurement . We measure height , knee-floor height , weight waist , upper arm calf circumference . 12 . Vital sign include blood pressure . We measure lie stand blood pressure well heart rate respiratory rate . The participant 's family physician ask optimize vitamin D level participant baseline accord Canadian guideline , impact fall risk . This involve measure Vitamin D level baseline , order Vitamin D 1,000 unit daily participant already take . Step 2 : Randomization one three group : 1 . Participants receive care usual ( Usual Care Group ; UCG ) provide long-term care unit . 2 . Participants receive stationary 1:1 interaction time research personnel conduct third group walk session individual care facility order control interpersonal interaction likely involved walk program ( Interpersonal Interaction Group ; IIG ) . This group receive equivalent interpersonal interaction time research personnel participate WPG group . This interaction time occur participant stationary , rather walk researcher . 3 . Participants participate Walking Program Group ( WPG ) , daily supervise walk program provide study personnel . After randomization walk group , license physiotherapist first review test result overall functioning , develop safe plan therapeutic walking program . This plan include protocol termination resumption walk case physical symptom shortness breath , lightheadedness chest pain . In situation unexpected medical symptom , supervise staff nurse nursing unit consult , may suggest termination walking , interim modification walk plan review medical physiotherapy staff . Subjects general gradually increase daily supervise walking time tolerate maximum 30 minute per day , Monday Friday . The distance number minute walk time record . Interpersonal interaction occur walk session , similar quality quantity Interpersonal Interaction Group . Participants wear gait belt walking ( walk program group ) closely monitor research assistant train safety issue . Step 3 : Subjects participate four month intervention , outline Step 2 . Step 4 : After 2 month intervention ( outlined Step 2 ) , subject re-tested per baseline assessment ( Step 1 ) exception height knee-floor height . Step 5 : After 4 month intervention ( outlined Step 2 ) , subject re-tested per baseline assessment ( Step 1 ) exception height knee-floor height . Step 6 : At 2 month 4 month post-intervention , subject re-tested per baseline assessment ( Step 1 ) exception height knee-floor height . A . In order control confound variable characterize sample , follow data extract chart , include chart copy admission , date admission , personal health number recent quarterly Minimum Data Set ( MDS ) , research personnel . The MDS computerize long-term care assessment system design improve care give long-term care resident , utilized province-wide since 2001 . Personal identify information extract purpose accurate link study information , remove prior data analysis . Data collect : date birth , race/ethnicity , gender , high level education , diagnose admittance , medication , health condition ( CHESS Scale : health instability ) ; Cognitive Performance Scale ; Depression Rating Scale ; Index Social Engagement ; ADL Self-Performance Hierarchy Scale ; Pain ; Continence ; Oral/Nutritional status ; Communication ; Mood Behaviour Patterns ; Physical Functioning Structural problem ; Activity Pursuit Patterns ; Special Treatments Procedures .
