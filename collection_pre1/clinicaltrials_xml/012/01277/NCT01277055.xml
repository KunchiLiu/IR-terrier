	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) great significance concern prevalence mortality western world . It usually diagnose catheterization coronary artery visually assess examiner . Thus great spectrum interobserver difference , especially come intermediate lesion . The gold standard ass haemodynamic significance measurement myocardial fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) . The FAME-study ( Tonino , De Bruyne et al . 2009 ) able show additional FFR- measurement patient intermediate lesion could significantly reduce stent implementation consequently mortality . However method use daily routine available fraction catheter labs worldwide . Taking account decision find especially intermediate lesion remain difficult . One major step simplify invasive approach concern intermediate lesion would establish non-invasive procedure localize coronary vessel intervene ahead catheterization . Do steady technical development cardiac MRI become powerful tool able determine myocardial vitality , perfusion function . In particular new generation 3 Tesla multi transmit MR high field strength well spatial resolution seem able show first pas myocardial perfusion precise . With new technology prefixed cardiac catheterization clinical relevant information make accessible thus reduce number unnecessary implement stent .</brief_summary>
