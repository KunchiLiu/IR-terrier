	<brief_summary>Primary aim : To show subject type 1 diabetes subcutaneous continuous insulin infusion , adjustment recommend basal insulin flow rate event physical activity allow subject practice sport without increase incidence hypoglycaemia physical activity ensue hour . ( NB : hypoglycaemia define blood glucose le 3 mmol/l 0,54 g/l accordance EMEA definition ) . The propose algorithm consist temporary reduction basal flow 50 percent 80 percent ( temporary basal flow TBR50 TBR80 ) depend intensity physical activity ( 50 percent VO2max 75 percent VO2max ) . Switching pump also study option adjust insulin dosage event unprogrammed physical activity ( temporary reduction basal flow 100 percent ) . Secondary aim : - Characterisation hypoglycaemia physical activity base CGMS data : symptomatic non-symptomatic nature hypoglycaemia , time onset hypoglycaemia relation start physical activity , degree severity hypoglycaemia . - Evaluation overall variation blood glucose event physical activity use CGMS data ( area curve ) . - Evaluation glucose restoration method use event hypoglycaemia . - Analysis subgroup patient without hypoglycaemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inclusion criterion : - Patients age 18 year , present type 1 diabetes least 1 year - Patients basal-prandial regimen treat functional insulin therapy - Patients subcutaneous insulin pump least 3 month - Patients HbA1c le 9 percent less 3 month - Patients stable basal flow least 1 week - Patients able pedal - Patients cover social security - Patients consent take part study sign write informed consent form . Non-inclusion criterion : - Patients history severe hypoglycaemia 6 month prior entry study - Patients unable detect hypoglycaemia - Patients perforate foot ulcer know history heart disease obliterative arteriopathy lower limb , history cerebrovascular accident , ongoing proliferative retinopathy renal failure . - Patients poorly control hypertension - Women either pregnant likely become pregnant - Patients deprive liberty judicial administrative decision , patient place legal guardianship . Primary criterion : Number episodes symptomatic non-symptomatic hypoglycaemia detect CGMS throughout duration physical activity subsequent hour next morning ( threshold : 3 mmol/l 0,54 g/l ) . Secondary criterion : Duration hypoglycaemia ( min ) , total time hypoglycaemia ( min , percent ) , time onset hypoglycaemia start physical activity , degree ( blood glucose level ) severity hypoglycaemia , area algebraic curve physical activity follow hour , nadir intervene glucose curve . Before start study , patient undergo effort test measurement VO2max order precisely define different threshold physical activity . Tests propose insulin adjustment : - Tests : Basal period Each patient undergo 5 consecutive test 6-month period . The test perform 3 hour start midday meal order define period blood glucose solely dependent basal flow . The 5 test comprise 4 physical test 1 rest test , perform random order : - The 4 physical test comprise 2 different level intensity ( 50 percent VO2max , 75 percent VO2max ) . At level , patient test 2 insulin dose adjustment algorithm concern basal flow rate insulin pump : - 50 percent VO2max , TBR reduce 50 percent ( 50 percent VO2maxTBR50 ) , - 50 percent VO2max , TBR reduce 80 percent ( 50 eprcent VO2max TBR80 ) - 75 percent VO2max , TBR reduce 80 percent ( 75 percent VO2max TBR80 ) - 75 percent VO2max , pump switch ( 75 percent VO2maxTBR100 ) - A resting test use comparator . Each physical test comprise test bicycle ergometer 40 minute : - 5-minute period intensity physical activity raise - 30-minute plateau desire intensity power - 5-minute recovery period . `` Prandial '' period In second phase , two test 50 percent VO2max perform 90 minute start meal order evaluate effect reduce rapid-acting insulin bolus onset hypoglycaemia . At time , 2 period ( `` basal '' `` prandial '' ) , patient ask score intensity physical activity Borg RPE rating scale . - Adjustment insulin dose : - The bolus meal precede physical activity ( lunch ) give usual , deliberate reduction ensue sport . - `` Basal '' period The adjustment basal flow proposed time physical activity take account intensity ensue physical activity : - moderate physical activity ( 50 percent VO2max ) - intense physical activity ( 75 percent VO2max ) 2 possible option : - reduction basal flow 50 percent 80 percent first case - reduction basal flow 80 percent switch pump second case . In event reduce basal flow , maintain throughout duration physical activity 2 hour follow end physical activity . If pump switch , remain switched throughout entire duration physical activity , remove order maintain study blind . It switch routinely end physical activity period , flow rate set prior physical activity . - Continuous Monitoring Glucose System ( CMGS ) A CMGS record intervene blood glucose level fit lunch worn next morning . Data record CMGS visible patient order prevent attempt modify insulin dos base value . Patients dinner 8 o'clock evening home order allow superimposition blood glucose curve facilitate interpretation . The CMGS remove next morning breakfast .</detailed_description>
