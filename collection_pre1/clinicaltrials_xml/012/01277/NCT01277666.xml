	<brief_summary>This randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate efficacy safety two dos ( 500 mg daily 500 mg twice daily ) GSK1605786A compare placebo 12 week adult subject moderately-to-severely active Crohn 's disease . Efficacy assess proportion subject achieve response , define decrease Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) score least 100 point ( clinical response ) . Clinical remission ( CDAI score less 150 point ) evaluate key secondary endpoint . Safety assess record adverse event , clinical laboratory parameter , vital sign electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Population pharmacokinetics evaluate two dos GSK1605786A . Health outcomes assessment include change Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( IBDQ ) , Short Form-36 version 2 ( SF-36v2 ) , EQ-5D Work Productivity Activity Impairment-CD ( WPAI-CD ) receipt disability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Efficacy Safety GSK1605786A Treatment Subjects With Moderately-to-Severely Active Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-centre , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study evaluate efficacy two oral dos GSK1605786A ( 500 mg daily , 500 mg twice daily ) compare placebo induction clinical response 12-week treatment period subject moderately-to-severely active Crohn 's disease . Secondary objective include assessment safety evaluation efficacy induction remission . The study plan randomise approximately 600 subject ( 200 subjects/group ) active Crohn 's disease , diagnose least 4 month document history disease small and/or large intestine , characterise Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) score 220 450 , inclusive . Subjects must report inadequate response intolerance Crohn 's disease treatment corticosteroids immunosuppressant . Inclusion subject receive prior treatment biologic anti-tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) agent limit approximately 50 % study population . All subject require diagnosis identification anatomic location Crohn 's disease , establish visualisation gastrointestinal tract within 12 month screen . Subjects visualisation gastrointestinal tract within 12 month require undergo endoscopic assessment screen period . Subjects require evidence current active inflammation time randomisation either endoscopy inflammatory biomarkers [ elevate C-reactive protein ( CRP ) great upper limit normal ( ULN ) plus positive faecal calprotectin test ] . Subjects meet requirement base inflammatory biomarker test result require qualify base endoscopic assessment screening . Subjects allow participate study continue stable dos agent typically use treat Crohn 's disease . Following screening period , subject randomise baseline receive blind treatment one two dos GSK1605786A ( 500 mg daily twice daily ) placebo 12 week . Response remission endpoint , use CDAI , evaluate Weeks 4 , 8 12 .</detailed_description>
