	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Dosing Regimens Treatment With Intravitreal Ranibizumab Injections Subjects With Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist 2 study period , 7-month fixed treatment period , follow 8-month alternate dose regimen period . Subjects could receive maximum 15 monthly injection ranibizumab 0.5 mg study , 7 injection ( Day 0 6 monthly visit ) fix treatment period maximum 8 injection alternate dose regimen period . During fixed treatment period , subject receive 7 monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg injection . During alternate dose regimen period , Month 7 Month 14 , subject evaluate monthly determine whether achieve study-specific visual acuity spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( VA-OCT ) stability criterion . Subjects continue receive monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg monthly injection VA-OCT stability criterion first meet . Upon meet VA-OCT stability criterion first time alternate dose regimen period , subject randomly assign 1:1 ratio one 2 dose regimen , PRN ( pro nata , `` as-needed '' ) Monthly regimen . PRN randomized subject : Subjects receive injection randomization visit future monthly visit VA-OCT stability criterion meet receive ranibizumab 0.5 mg injection future monthly visit VA-OCT stability criterion meet . Monthly randomize subject : Subjects continue receive ranibizumab 0.5 mg injection monthly visit . Monthly non-randomized subject : Subjects meet VA-OCT stability criterion month Month 7 Month 14 randomize receive 8 monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg injection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For sexually active woman childbearing potential , use appropriate form contraception ( abstinence ) duration study . Ocular Inclusion Criteria ( Study Eye ) Foveal centerinvolved macular edema secondary branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO ) ( include hemiretinal retinal vein occlusion [ HRVO ] ) central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) . Best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) use Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) chart 20/40 20/320 ( Snellen equivalent ) study eye . Mean central subfield thickness &gt; 300 µm 2 spectraldomain optical coherence tomography measurement ( screen Day 0 [ first day treatment ] ) . History cerebral vascular accident myocardial infarction within 3 month prior Day 0 . History systemic antivascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) proVEGF treatment within 6 month prior Day 0 . History allergy fluorescein . History allergy ranibizumab injection relate molecule . Relevant systemic disease may associate increased systemic VEGF level . History successfully treat malignancy exclusion criterion . Uncontrolled blood pressure . Pregnancy lactation . Daily use oral corticosteroid treat chronic condition . Required treatment injectable corticosteroid treat musculoskeletal condition . Participation investigational trial within 30 day prior Day 0 involve treatment drug device receive regulatory approval time study entry . Ocular Exclusion Criteria ( Study Eye ) Prior episode retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) . Brisk afferent pupillary defect . History previous intravitreal antiVEGF therapy RVO study eye . History previous therapeutic treatment RVO , antiVEGF therapy , within 4 month prior screen visit , include intraocular corticosteroid . History previous surgical treatment RVO , include radial optic neurotomy sheathotomy . History presence agerelated macular degeneration ( AMD ) ( dry form grade AgeRelated Eye Disease Study [ AREDS ] Stage 2 high wet form ) . History laser photocoagulation macular edema within 4 month prior Day 0 . History panretinal scatter photocoagulation sector laser photocoagulation within 4 month prior Day 0 anticipate within next 4 month follow Day 0 . History par plana vitrectomy . History intraocular surgery within 2 month prior Day 0 anticipate within next 7 month follow Day 0 . History yttriumaluminumgarnet ( YAG ) capsulotomy perform within 2 month prior Day 0 . Previous filtration surgery study eye . History herpetic ocular infection . History ocular toxoplasmosis . History rhegmatogenous retinal detachment . History idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy . Evidence upon examination vitreoretinal interface disease either clinical examination spectraldomain optical coherence tomography ( SDOCT ) , think contribute macular edema . Presence ocular condition , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity study . Visually significant hemorrhage obscure fovea felt major contributor reduce visual acuity . The subject follow hemorrhage fovea clear point longer major contributor reduce visual acuity , subject may screen study . Presence substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity 3 line . Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) ≥ 30 mmHg . If subject 's IOP ≥ 30 mmHg , subject refer glaucoma treatment may rescreened 1 month . Evidence upon examination pseudoexfoliation . Aphakia . Evidence upon examination external ocular infection , include conjunctivitis , chalazion , significant blepharitis . Evidence upon examination diabetic retinopathy , define eye diabetic patient one microaneurysm outside area vein occlusion ( inclusive eye ) . Other relevant ocular disease may associate increase intraocular VEGF level . Improvement ≥ 10 letter bestcorrected visual acuity ETDRS score screen Day 0 .</criteria>
