	<brief_title>Pilot Study Secondary Causes Osteopenia/Osteoporosis Adults With Breast Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The interaction aging , cancer , bone loss poorly understood . Cancer cancer therapy could potentially accelerate bone loss increase risk osteopenia osteoporosis . The hypothesis observational study secondary cause bone loss prevalent patient breast prostate cancer high risk treatment related bone loss . In order test hypothesis , prospective pilot study systematically evaluate secondary cause bone loss cohort patient nonmetastatic breast prostate cancer osteopenia/osteoporosis . 1 . Identify patient nonmetastatic breast cancer newly diagnose osteopenia/osteoporosis ( Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry Bone Density scan T-score average hip ( femoral neck ) spine ( L1-L4 ) less -1.0 -2.5/ less -2.5 , respectively ) . 2 . Identify patient nonmetastatic prostate cancer newly diagnose osteopenia/osteoporosis ( Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry Bone Density scan T-score average hip ( femoral neck ) spine ( L1-L4 ) less -1.0 -2.5/ less -2.5 , respectively ) . 3 . Refer patient City Hope Endocrinology Osteoporosis Clinic . 4 . Approach patient consecutive order refer Endocrinology Osteoporosis Clinic . 5 . Describe study patient : patient consent refuse . 6 . Once consent , patient 's medical record review Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry Bone Density report obtain City Hope record screen medical institution record confirm diagnosis osteopenia/osteoporosis normal bone health . 7 . Study participant undergo evaluation secondary cause bone per standard care patient questionnaire . 8 . Furthermore , laboratory test support secondary cause bone loss retrospectively collect via chart review .</detailed_description>
