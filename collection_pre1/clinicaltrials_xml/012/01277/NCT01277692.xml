A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . A single repeat laboratory evaluation allow eligibility determination . Male female 18 65 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . Male subject must agree use one contraception method list protocol . Body weight great equal 50 kg ( 110 lb . ) men great equal 45 kg ( 99 lb . ) woman . For Part 1 , body mass index ( BMI ) 18.532 kg/m2 inclusive allow . For Part 3 , BMI 18.535.0 kg/m2 inclusive allow . For healthy subject Part 1 Part 2 , Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase , bilirubin , creatinine less upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( isolated bilirubin &lt; 2.0xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . QTcB QTcF &lt; 450 msec ; QTc &lt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . The subject 's systolic blood pressure inside range 90140 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure inside range 4590 mmHg heart rate inside range 50100 beat per minute ( bpm ) female subject 45100 bpm male subject . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . The subject able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction likely complete study plan . The following Supplemental inclusion criterion Part 3 : HCV positive subject : Treatment naive chronically infect genotype 1 HCV patient , define infection &gt; 6 month prior HCV therapy . An HCV RNA viral load great 100,000 IU/mL use COBAS TaqMan HCV test HCV genotype 1a 1b assessed VERSANT HCV genotyping LiPA 2.0 ( Bayer Healthcare , Berkeley , California ) , direct Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) sequence NS5B gene Hepatitis C virus infection mixed genotype exclude . HCV subject mixed genotype eligible study . ALT great equal 3x ULN allow . Liver biopsy within two year prior screen indicate absence cirrhosis . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol . A positive prestudy test Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody Hepatitis B surface antigen . For healthy subject Parts 1 2 , positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . Chronic HCV infect subject Part 3 positive HCV antibody positive HCV RNA . Pregnant female determine positive serum urine Human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test screen prior dosing . Subject mentally legally incapacitate . Has history regular alcohol consumption averaging : &gt; 7 drinks/week woman &gt; 14 drinks/week men within 6 month screen visit . Unwilling abstain alcohol 48 hour prior start dose collection final pharmacokinetic sample treatment period . For healthy subject Parts 1 2 , history regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 3 month screen visit indication tobacco use evidence positive urine cotinine test screening . For chronic HCV infect subject Part 3 , history regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product allow ; however , use tobacco allow day PK draw study site .

The subject positive prestudy drug screen . A minimum list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates , cannabinoids , phencyclidine ( PCP ) , benzodiazepine . Unwilling refrain use illicit drug adhere protocolstated restriction participate study . Use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new investigational entity within 12 month prior first dose day . History presence allergy intolerance study drug component drug class , history drug allergy , opinion physician responsible , contraindicate participation . In addition , heparin use PK sample , subject history sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia enrol . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Holter monitoring show one following : Any symptomatic arrhythmia ( except isolate extra systole ) ; Sustained cardiac arrhythmia ( atrial fibrillation flutter , sustain ventricular tachycardia ( SVT ) ( &gt; 10 consecutive beat ) ) ; Nonsustained sustain ventricular tachycardia ( define &gt; 3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beat ) ; Any conduction abnormality ( include specific leave right complete bundle branch block , atrioventricular ( AV ) block [ 2nd degree high awake subject ] , WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome ( WPW ) syndrome , preexcitation syndrome ) ; Symptomatic sinus pause sinus pause &gt; 3 second unless patient straining , vomit , type hypervagal response ; 300 supraventricular ectopic beat 24 hour ; 250 ventricular ectopic beat 24 hour ; Ischemia , diagnose sequence EKG change include flat slop STsegment depression &gt; 0.1 mV , gradual onset offset last minimum period 1 minute .
