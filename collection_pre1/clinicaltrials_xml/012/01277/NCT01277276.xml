	<brief_summary>Currently methodology assign risk development chemo brain thus , study understand patient develop chemo brain along study potential treatment face major hurdle . This study define hemodynamic/optical parameter normal individual cancer patient undergo chemotherapy potentially identifying optical parameter associate development chemo brain , lead new insight origin chemo brain condition , importantly potentially identify parameter may predict develop `` chemo brain '' order direct investigation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Chemotherapy Side Effects Cancer Patients : Non-invasive Optical Measurements Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher use Non-invasive optical imaging , diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging , measure various tissue determine chemo brain symptom . Near infrared diffuse optical image real-time , non-invasive technique measure hemodynamic variation base change hemoglobin oxygenation . Tissue general cerebral cortex surface particular , transparent near infrared light . Direct optical measurement cerebral hemodynamic parameter superior systemic approach infer brain level hemoglobin . Optical image conjunction physiologic maneuver measure vascular tone reactivity may permit early detection change physiology precede onset chemo brain symptom . Since chemo brain specifically impact work memory executive function optical imaging measure frontal cortical area behind forehead .</detailed_description>
