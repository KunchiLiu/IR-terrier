	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treating Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene ( Akt ) inhibitor MK2206 achieve objective tumor response ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] ) advance breast cancer patient phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PIK3CA ) Akt mutation and/or phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) loss mutation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 6 month progression-free survival MK2206 . II . To determine baseline molecular marker may predict clinical outcome . III . To determine pharmacodynamic marker blood tumor tissue may predict decrease proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen ( Ki-67 ) clinical outcome . IV . To determine safety tolerability MK2206 previously treat patient advanced breast cancer . V. To determine decrease Ki-67 2 week correlate anti-tumor effect ( CR , PR , stable disease [ SD ] &gt; 6 month ) . VI . To determine concordance PIK3CA PTEN status primary tumor distant metastasis . VII . To determine concordance PIK3CA status circulate free deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) distant metastasis . OUTLINE : Patients receive Akt Inhibitor MK-2206 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 week .</detailed_description>
