	<brief_summary>A Phase I trial Induction chemotherapy Chemoradiotherapy TS-1 Cisplatin ( SP ) first-line treatment patient high risk advance gastric cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Radiation therapy effectively use esophageal cancer , laryngeal cancer rectal cancer , gastric cancer rarely study Korea . There increase interest preoperative radiotherapy effort improve survival increase pathologic complete response patient gastric cancer . Chemoradiotherapy may best modality neoadjuvant set high-risk advanced tumor , type IV large type III , N3/bulky N2 metastasis , locally advanced tumor .</brief_summary>
