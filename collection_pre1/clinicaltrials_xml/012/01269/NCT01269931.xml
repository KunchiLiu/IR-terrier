	<brief_summary>Bronchoscopy procedure whereby small flexible camera use inspect biopsy abnormality lung . Linear endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration ( EBUS-TBNA ) revolutionary diagnostic pulmonary procedure allow visualization safe , accurate biopsy structure around lung bronchoscopy . EBUS-TBNA challenging learn . Historically , bronchoscopy teach use apprenticeship model , whereby trainee practice patient . With introduction computer bronchoscopy simulator , trainee obtain basic bronchoscopy skill practice simulator , rather practice patient . This study aim compare trainee EBUS-TBNA performance actual procedure patient , follow training computer EBUS-TBNA simulator versus conventional clinical EBUS-TBNA training ( trainee taught practice patient ) . Our hypothesis skill learn use computer EBUS-TBNA simulator transferable clinical EBUS-TBNA performance , mean use computer EBUS-TBNA simulator training good learning skill practice patient . The use EBUS-TBNA simulator train could advantage minimize burden procedural learning patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Learners Group 1 undergo train EBUS-TBNA simulator perform EBUS-TBNA study patient . Learners Group 2 complete one month clinical Interventional Pulmonary Medicine rotation . During rotation , complete ≥15 ≤25 EBUS-TBNA clinical procedure Interventional Pulmonologist experience EBUS-TBNA . Learners group receive standard EBUS-TBNA knowledge review process patient care EBUS-TBNA experience . This include series oral question write lymph node stag diagram need correctly answer , prior perform EBUS-TBNA study patient . Learners Group 2 complete review process informally number occasion Interventional Pulmonary Medicine rotation . Learners Group 1 formally undergo review process 5 time EBUS-TBNA simulation training . Bronchoscopy perform utilizing 1T-160 Olympus video bronchoscope ( Olympus Canada , Markham , Canada ) airway examination BF-UC160F-OL8 ( EBUS bronchoscope - Olympus Canada , Markham , Canada ) EBUS-TBNA procedure . In order standardize difference bronchoscopy method , single attend Interventional Pulmonologist ( IP ) responsible perform 16 bronchoscopies learner . The complete airway examination additional non-EBUS-TBNA sample perform attend IP . All endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscopy performance metric record another IP involve procedure standard data sheet . EBUS-TBNA perform learner 3 specific goal : 1 . Intubation EBUS-TBNA bronchoscope . 2 . Lymph Node Ultrasound Examination . Identify 5 major lymph node station ( 11R , 4R , 7 , 4L , 11L ) . 3 . Sampling two lymph node per patient . The order location lymph node discretion attend IP . Following biopsy two lymph node station learner , attend IP complete rest procedure , include biopsy necessary . The learner expect perform 3 successful pass two lymph node , total 5 allow attempt per lymph node station . The learner procedure time start time first intubation attempt EBUS-TBNA bronchoscope , finish last biopsy second lymph node station . If clinically important lymph node present 3 successful aspiration desire , stopwatch stop attend IP perform biopsy . Samples place alcohol preservative sent cytopathology lab per routine procedure . No indication group allocation available clinical cytopathologist interpret sample . To enrol , patient learner must give write informed consent . The EBUS-TBNA simulator use study AccuTouch Flexible Bronchoscopy Simulator ( CAE Healthcare , Montreal , Canada ) , equip EBUS-TBNA module . This simulator describe detail previously article cited end ClinicalTrials.gov entry .</detailed_description>
