	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) account 90 % diabetes . The worldwide prevalence T2DM increase . Microvascular macrovascular complication well know cause significant morbidity shorten life expectancy diabetic patient . T2DM lead cause adult-onset blindness , renal failure , limbs amputation , ischaemic heart disease stroke industrialized world . Progressive pancreatic beta-cell failure together insulin resistance underlie pathogenesis T2DM . Glycaemic control essential fundamental management diabetes . Randomized control trial confirm long term benefit achieve glycaemic control early course disease future clinical outcome . Long term follow The Diabetes Control Complications Trial Research Group ( DCCT ) U.K . Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) cohorts show improve glycaemic control reduce incidence microvascular macrovascular complication . It generally agree HbA1c &lt; 7 % reasonable goal adult reduce risk diabetes complication . Subgroup analyse DCCT UKPDS result Action Diabetes Vascular Disease : Preterax Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation ( ADVANCE ) trial suggest small incremental benefit microvascular outcome HbA1c value closer normal . In subgroup analysis ACCORD study , subject without history cardiovascular disease attain HbA1c goal 6.5 % low risk cardiovascular endpoint HbA1c goal 7 % . Therefore , select individual patient include short duration diabetes , long life expectancy significant cardiovascular disease , may benefit stringent HbA1c goal &lt; 6.5 % , value close normal individual . According American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) European Association Study Diabetes , lifestyle modification plus Metformin well-validated step 1 therapy patient T2DM . Sulfonylurea insulin treatment form step 2 therapy fail achieve optimal glycaemic control step 1 treatment . Sulfonylurea insulin secretagogue . It act glucose-independent fashion increase insulin concentration irrespective ambient glucose concentration . Despite efficacy , associate increase risk hypoglycaemia weight gain . Incretins gut-derived hormone include Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) . Incretins release circulation meal . Both GLP-1 GIP stimulate endogenous insulin secretion glucose-dependent fashion . They also inhibit glucagon secretion , delay gastric empty induce satiety . The combined effect incretins augment insulin secretion suppress glucagon reduces post-prandial glucose excursion . In animal model , GLP-1 also show preserve pancreatic beta-cell mass increase proliferation decrease apoptosis . In T2DM patient , attenuate post-prandial GLP-1 secretion may partially explain increased post-prandial rise glucose concentration . However , incretins short half-lives minute . They rapidly inactivate enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV ( DPP-4 ) circulation . Inhibitors enzyme DPP-4 augment active incretin level delay clearance active incretins , hence augment incretin action resultant improvement glycaemic control T2DM patient . In late stage T2DM , progressive pancreatic beta-cell failure frequently result deterioration glycaemic control despite oral drug treatment , necessitate supplementary insulin therapy . New generation once-daily , long-acting basal insulin may better safety profile term less hypoglycaemic event compare traditional intermediate-acting basal insulin . Supplementary basal insulin , titrate appropriately , almost always improve fast blood glucose level HbA1c control . Sitagliptin orally active , potent highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) October 2006 new class oral drug treatment T2DM . Sitagliptin market Januvia Merck &amp; Co . In April 2007 , FDA approve oral combination sitagliptin metformin market Janumet preparation 50/500mg 50/1000mg dosage per tablet . Sitagliptin prove effective treat T2DM minimal risk hypoglycaemia together additional benefit reduce glucagon , slow gastric empty induce satiety . Insulin glargine , market Sanofi Aventis name Lantus , long-acting basal insulin analogue . It advantage long action duration 18 26 hour peakless profile , resembles basal insulin secretion non-diabetic pancreatic beta-cells . In T2DM patient , propose new treatment regimen consist combination DPP-IV inhibitor plus metformin follow long-acting basal insulin may effective achieve good sustain glycaemic control less hypoglycaemic drawback compare traditional regimen metformin follow sulfonylurea finally intermediate-acting insulin . This propose new treatment regimen form basis study . The objective multicentre , randomize , open-label prospective study evaluate efficacy safety new treatment regimen metformin plus sitagliptin ( Janumet ) follow long-acting basal insulin ( Lantus ) treatment compare usual treatment regimen metformin follow sulfonylurea intermediate-acting basal insulin T2DM patient .</detailed_description>
