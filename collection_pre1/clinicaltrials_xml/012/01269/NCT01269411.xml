	<brief_title>RO4929097 Treating Patients With Recurrent Invasive Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine , patient recurrent MGs ( many receive dexamethasone , moderate CYP3A4 inducer ) , safety maximum-tolerated dose RO4909297 administer 2 dose level . II . Determine pharmacokinetics , intratumoral drug concentration , target modulation , evidence treatment effect malignant glioma tumor tissue R04929097 administer dose found Part A . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile RO4909297 patient recurrent MGs ( many receive dexamethasone , moderate CYP3A4 inducer ) . II . Determine progression-free survival patient recurrent malignant glioma follow treatment R04929097 . III . Determine RPTD dose RO4929097 significantly inhibit p75^NTR cleavage processing . IV . Determine effect RO4929097 establishment growth BTIC culture neurosphere growth condition , effect proliferation , ability self-renewal , ability differentiate along lineage-specific pathway . V. Determine ability RO4929097 inhibit Notch signaling , assess downstream target activation , glioma tissue patient recurrent MG. VI . Determine association number serum , tumor , BTIC marker response R04929097 . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation ( part A ) study follow open-label ( part B ) study . PART A : Patients receive oral RO4929097 daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART B : Patients receive oral RO4929097 daily day 1-7 undergo surgery day 8 . Beginning 28 day later , patient receive oral RO4929097 daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Post resection tumor specimen collect correlative study , include pharmacokinetic biomarker assay . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 6-12 month .</detailed_description>
