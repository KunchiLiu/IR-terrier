	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient acute kidney injury ( AKI ) high risk bleed account coagulopathy , platelet dysfunction , frequent liver dysfunction invasive procedures.In patient high risk bleeding , anticoagulation restrict circuit ( regional anticoagulation ) advocate method choice.However , citrate anticoagulation may many metabolic consequence , metabolic alkalosis due citrate metabolism bicarbonate , patient liver disease , metabolic acidosis hypocalcemia may occur.Implementation citrate-based regional anticoagulation frequent monitoring acid-base electolytes also challenge nurse eliminate need low-dose systemic anticoagulation thromboses prophylaxis patient . Citrate-based regional anticoagulation therefore mainly advocated patient high-risk bleeding . The investigator plan implement open-label randomize control trial assess effectiveness citrate-based regional anticoagulation critically ill patient AKI special emphasis safety profile treatment patient severe liver failure .</brief_summary>
