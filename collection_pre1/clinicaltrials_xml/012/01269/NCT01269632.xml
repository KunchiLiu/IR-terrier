	<brief_summary>Background : With improvement prognosis HIV-infected infant , thanks availability antiretroviral therapy , young adult infect HIV since birth become emerge group among HIV-infected population . Morbidity , mortality immunovirological evolution young adult need study large population compare patient infect HIV later adulthood general population term mortality . Moreover , study accelerate premature ageing , link HIV and/or antiretroviral therapy , particularly interesting population . Objectives : To study transition adulthood evolution HIV-1 -2 perinatally infect young adult : 1 ) To study teenager adult transition term clinical immunovirological status , school professional integration , sexuality reproductive life , transition paediatrics adult department ; 2 ) To study prognosis , morbidity mortality accord age , infection stage time antiretroviral initiation therapeutic history ; 3 ) To study incidence expression adverse event potential link antiretroviral therapy ; 4 ) To study marker potential premature ageing , metabolic , cardiovascular immunological point view .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cohort Young Adults Infected With HIV Since Birth During Childhood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : A national multicenter cohort young adult , infect HIV since birth childhood , include common module physiopathological module ( metabolic , , cardiovascular immunological ) . A control group HIV-uninfected young adult include comparison latter module . Patients age 18 25 year age , whose HIV diagnosis make age 13 eligible ANRS CO19 COVERTE . This cohort extension EPF cohort ( ANRS CO10 ) , follow-up stop age 18 , extension adult HIV diagnosis establish age 13 . Questionnaires fill physician year . Self-administered questionnaire also carry . Blood sample specific biological exam collect biobank constitute . In physiopathological module , specific exam carry inclusion 3 year follow-up : metabolic immunological exam , OGTT , CT-scan DXA-scan , cardiovascular exploration ( carotid intima-media thickness , pulse wave velocity … ) . An estimated 400 enrolment first 3 year expect common module estimate 200 HIV-infected subject 75 uninfected control expect physiopathological module . Expected result : The follow-up young adult cohort bring new data long term efficacy antiretroviral treatment adverse event , metabolic , cardiovascular immunological , point view , link HIV infection per se . This analysis take account characteristic population , compare adult infect adulthood : early exposure HIV antiretroviral treatment , different social context , difficulty care , different exposure risk factor adverse event complication . We evaluate impact transition adulthood transition paediatrics adult department , clinical prognosis , adherence , professional schooling integration , sexuality , social life .</detailed_description>
