	<brief_summary>The high-grade malignant brain tumor , glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , comprise majority primary brain tumor adult . This group tumor also exhibit aggressive behavior , result median overall survival duration 9-12 month GBM , 3-4 year AA . Initial therapy consist either surgical resection , external beam radiation . All patient experience recurrence first-line therapy , improvement first-line salvage therapy critical enhance quality-of-life prolonging survival . It unknown currently use intravenous ( IV ) therapy even cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . The investigator show previous phase I trial single Super-selective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion ( SIACI ) Bevacizumab ( 15mg/kg ) safe effective treatment recurrent GBM . Therefore , phase I/II clinical research trial extension trial investigator seek test hypothesis repeat dose intraarterial Bevacizumab safe effective treatment recurrent malignant glioma . By achieve aim study investigator also determine IV therapy Bevacizumab combine repeat select intraarterial Bevacizumab improve progression free overall survival . The investigator expect project provide important information regard utility repeat SIACI Bevacizumab therapy malignant glioma , may alter way drug deliver patient near future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repeated Super-selective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) Treatment Relapsed GBM AA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard care recur GBM patient receive Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) intravenously ( IV ) 10mg/kg every two week tumor grow 25 % . At point , patient deem treatment failure give another treatment . Because blood brain barrier ( BBB ) IV drug penetrate blood vessel wall well get brain , one know sure IV drug actually get brain infusion . We recently complete Phase I clinical trial show SIACI Bevacizumab safe effective dose 15mg/kg patient recurrent malignant glioma . This two arm open-label , non-randomized trial follow study trial ask two simple question : Is safe deliver repeat dos Bevacizumab intraarterially use super selective intraarterial delivery technique ? Is necessary combine IA regimen treatment biweekly IV Bevacizumab order improve progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) ? Information trial yield important answer durability efficacy delivery technique may radically change way chemotherapy give patient brain tumor . Current Standard Care : Day 0 : Intravenous Bevacizumab ( 10mg/kg ) Day 14 , 28 ( every two week thereafter ) : Intravenous Bevacizumab Therefore experimental aspect treatment plan include : 1 . Subjects first treat Mannitol prior chemotherapy infusion ( Mannitol 20 % ; 12.5 mL/s 2 minute ) order disrupt blood brain barrier . This technique use several thousand patient previous study IA delivery chemotherapy malignant glioma . We use without complication 30 patient Phase I protocol well . 2 . To treat patient one two arm repeat intraarterial delivery ( SIACI ) Bevacizumab patient recur relapse high grade glioma . Each arm get IA delivery one arm get IV Bevacizumab biweekly well arm get intervene IV therapy . In arm , IA therapy repeat MRI show progression . Persistent progression three intraarterial chemotherapy would remove patient trial .</detailed_description>
