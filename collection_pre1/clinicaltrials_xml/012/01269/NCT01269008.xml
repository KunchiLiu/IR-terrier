	<brief_title>Closed Loop System With Pramlintide Versus Exenatide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes complication minimize forestall use intensive insulin management . In post-Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) era , diabetologists around globe engage develop good method improve glycemic control patient type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) . To achieve DCCT-recommended glycemic hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1c ) goal , addition physician , engineering pharmaceutical company augment ability improve control innovative compound technology continuous glucose monitoring . Despite substantial advance , hyper- hypoglycemia continue problematic management T1DM , especially child . Current T1DM management involve check blood glucose pre-prandially bedtime ( 4 times/day ) , make insulin dose adjustment base 4 blood glucose measurement . This approach woefully inadequate . Post-meal hyperglycemia miss , low blood glucose undetected patient symptomatic hypoglycemia . Moreover , depend patient make appropriate dose modification basal rate insulin pump , without guidance adequate blood glucose measurement . The continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) increasingly studied tool examine glucose trend , help combat inadequate self-monitoring . However , CGMS still rely patient 's ability make accurate insulin dose adjustment base glucose reading . To address issue close loop system investigation . The closed loop system develop closely emulate physiologic insulin delivery . The algorithm develop model beta cell validate hyperglycemic clamp study use subcutaneous site measurement blood glucose insulin delivery . The algorithm know external Physiologic Insulin Delivery ( ePID ) . Current study suggest basal requirement detect accurately , algorithm responds effectively . However , meal related elevation blood glucose remain challenge , blood glucose level begin rise see subcutaneous glucose sensor signal , already late administer insulin way effectively minimize postprandial glucose peak . Improvements ePID algorithm study improve postprandial response success , require user intervention best result , despite glucose excursion fail normalize post-prandial period . It likely improvement postprandial glycemia limit insulin monotherapy . Besides insulin dysregulated hormone glucagon amylin , contribute post-prandial hyperglycemia . The autoimmune destruction insulin-secreting beta cell pancreas presume cause T1DM . In addition insulin , hormone glucagon amylin play role normalize glucose excursion . Failure glucagon suppression result immediate postprandial hyperglycemia , loss glucagon response hypoglycemia result late postprandial hypoglycemia . Despite increase use subcutaneous continuous insulin administration newer insulin analog , insulin replacement remain imperfect , glucose excursion inadequately control diabetes . This suggest factor , addition diet insulin management , may need addressed postprandial glucose excursion normalize T1DM . The recent discovery hormone amylin enhance understanding postprandial glucose homeostasis . Patients T1DM deficiency insulin amylin . Amylin , 37-amino acid polypeptide hormone , co-secreted pancreatic beta cell conjunction insulin response nutrient stimulus . Amylin , immediate postprandial period , may mediate part effect suppress glucagon secretion , result suppression hepatic glucose production slow gastric emptying . Pramlintide acetate synthetic analog naturally occur human hormone amylin . It effectively reproduce amylin agonist activity equipotent fashion . Pramlintide acetate report improve glycemic control adult type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus . Specifically , postprandial glucose excursion improve adjunctive pramlintide use compare insulin monotherapy . Exenatide synthetic analog exendin-4 . It FDA approve use adult type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Clinical study indicate exenatide effective decrease postprandial glucose excursion . The investigator 's brochure exenatide suggest adult T2DM , exenatide well tolerated 0.1 mcg/ kg/ dose , result glucose lowering . Our preliminary data child T1DM suggest 1.25 mcg 2.5 mcg good pre-prandial initial dos prandial insulin dose reduction 30 % . The principal mechanism action T1DM suppression glucagon , subsequent suppression hepatic glucose production decrease immediate post-prandial hyperglycemia . These effect result reduction HbA1c beyond reduction observed insulin alone . Additionally , T2DM , exenatide delay gastric emptying , decrease food intake centrally mediate mechanism cause satiety improve weight control . The notable adverse effect exenatide nausea , improve duration treatment steady dose escalation exenatide . Hypoglycemia may occur concurrent use insulin . In current exploratory study propose novel way combat immediate postprandial hyperglycemia subject T1DM use study medication experimental close loop system . Subjects close loop system prior eligibility , would use close loop system early time . We use prandial pramlintide/exenatide first protocol , test hypothesis intervention superior use insulin monotherapy close loop system . This would Biologic , phase I , single center study pair , randomize , control comparison pramlintide insulin versus exenatide insulin Vs insulin monotherapy use ePID closed-loop system insulin delivery . We stratify study subject follow sub-groups 5 subject 22-30 year old , 4 subject 18-21 year old , 4 subject 16-18 year old . We would also begin study 22-30 year patient sub-group transition sub-groups evaluate safety issue . 22-30 year old one would consider adult subset , 18-21 year old would consider pediatric subset accord guideline FDA 's Center Devices Radiological Health ( CDRH ) 16-18 year old consider typical pediatric population . At time , Spanish-speaking subject recruit Medtronic Minimed yet literature Spanish may use explain study group patient . When future Medtronic able provide u appropriate Spanish literature , time amend protocol include group subject . Study Procedure : Screening : Screening evaluation perform 1-2 month prior study enrollment , consist informed consent , medical history , physical examination ( include height , weight , vital sign ) , blood sample clinical laboratory test . The clinical laboratory test include CBC check anemia , hemoglobin A1C ( within last month ) , serum electrolyte , serum amylase , Serum HCG pregnancy test female subject . The approximate volume blood expect less 5 ml . Following informed consent ( appropriate subject assent ) subject find eligible study , undergo baseline open-loop evaluation use Medtronic Data logger continuous glucose monitor ( Medtronic Diabetes , Northridge , CA ) . The data glucose excursion collect usual insulin dosage appropriately configure algorithm closed-loop system inpatient admission . Basal rate insulin carbohydrate ratio adjust period screen start 3 study undergo subsequently . After screen , subject undergo 3-period crossover design trial random order . Study A Subjects admit general clinical research center ( GCRC ) even prior study 6 PM . For female subject stat serum HCG pregnancy test do prior start study . Two sensor place subcutaneous tissue . Insertion IV line occur 9-10 PM . During night hourly sample blood glucose use adjust insulin basal boluses maintain euglycemia . Around 6 a.m. subject start closed-loop system automate delivery insulin base glucose sensor measurement . An intravenous line insert antecubital fossa maintain blood glucose concentration within normal range . Blood sample basal glucose , insulin , glucagon concentration draw minus 30 , minus 10 , 0 min prior study start . For study A ( Control ) : Subjects receive meal 0 minute ( approximately 7 AM breakfast ) , 300 min ( approximately Noon lunch ) dinner 600 min ( approximately 5 PM dinner ) . A partial bolus insulin administer prior breakfast addition close loop system ( since system expect calibrated time breakfast ) . For study B : Subjects receive 30 mcg pramlintide 300 600 minute .
