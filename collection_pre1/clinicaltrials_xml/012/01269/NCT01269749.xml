Calculations support sample size detail two aim . Patient eligibility . Eligibility criterion include follow : 1 . A diagnosis GD base initial laboratory study show suppressed Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) ( i.e . &lt; 0.01 ) ; high total triiodothyronine ( T3 ) , high total thyroxine ( T4 ) and/or free T4 level ; elevate thyroid stimulate immunoglobulin ( TSI ) titer ; increase diffuse uptake 123I , 131I , 99Tc thyroid gland . 2 . Age &lt; 18 year time GD disease diagnosis . 3 . Non-smoking parent . Subject enrollment . Practitioners University Florida Pediatric Thyroid Center Baylor Pediatric Endocrinology Division identify eligible individual study participation . Patients enrol appropriate consent/assent procedure satisfy . At time collection , investigator record age , gender , current treatment , treatment history Graves ' disease ( i.e. , antithryoid drug ( ATDs ) and/or 131I therapy include dose ) . These study perform child treat 131I part physician prescribe clinical care . Children treat 131I sole purpose generate subject study . After treatment decide upon physician patient , patient offer participation provide balance enrollment treatment/age/gender category . 1 . Primary aim ( 1 ) secondary aim ( ) : Perform dosimetry assess whole body tissue specific radiation exposure child treat 131I determine potential cancer risk data . At present , data available assess whole body tissue-specific radiation exposure child treat 131I GD . Theoretical model do , base actual data . Knowing exposure specific organ radioactivity use determine tissue-specific risk malignancy . The investigator thus propose perform cross-sectional dosimetry study child treat 131I determine tissue specific whole body radiation exposure . These study design Dr. David Cheng ( University Florida University ) , Dr. Patrick Zanzonico ( Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ; NY ) , Dr. James Dziura ( University Florida University ) . Patient 's Total-Body Mass Administered Activity . On day administration therapeutic administer activity 131I , patient weigh . Immediately prior administration , therapeutic administer activity 131I measure dose calibrator 131I setting , activity date time assay administration record . This activity prescribe treat physician University Florida Baylor . Gamma Camera Imaging . All 131I gamma camera whole-body scanning perform use 20 % photopeak energy window ( i.e . 364 keV + 10 % = 328 400 keV ) scan speed 10 cm/min scan . The scan length set patient include entire patient scan length use scan give patient . The exact date time whole-body scan record . The time post-administration whole-body scan calculate time interval ( hour ) date time 131I administration date time whole-body scanning . Determination Organ Total-Body Activities . The determination organ total-body activity use patient calibration standard . The patient undergo conjugate-view whole-body scan within 30 60 minute 131I administration ( i.e . nominally specified time 0 ) first post-administration void bowel movement . In addition , scan perform one day , four day administration dose . A blood sample ( 10cc ) also draw measure amount radioactive iodide blood time assessment DNA damage marker . For patient , net ( i.e . background-subtracted ) geometric-mean count rate total body initial scan thus correspond 100 % administered activity . As noted , scan perform 30 60 minute post-administration allow dispersion activity throughout body , effect scatter attenuation grossly initial scan subsequent scan patient . For time-0 subsequent conjugate-view whole-body scan , posterior ( lower-detector ) gamma-camera image `` mirror '' align anterior ( upper-detector ) image . The region interest ( ROIs ) manually draw around organ interest ( thyroid , salivary gland , liver , intestine , stomach , urinary bladder ) total body . For organ , ROI may draw scan best visualize copy paste onto whole-body scan , translate and/or rotate ROI need scan accurately superimpose organ . Note , scan , single background ( BG ) ROI , drawn outside close body , may use . Statistical Analysis . OLINDA-based Calculation Organ Absorbed Doses Effective Dose . The OLINDA dosimetry program use assess absorbed dos ( 11 , 76 ) . In OLINDA , investigator select `` Fraction Half-times '' option ( OLINDA 's `` Kinetics Input Form '' ) enter best-fit parameter respective time-activity function ( A/100 % Ta , , applicable , B/100 % Tb ) specify source region - thyroid , salivary gland , liver , intestinal content , stomach content , urinary bladder content , red marrow , total body . Note OLINDA require zero-time intercept value fraction ( % ) administer activity . Click `` hr '' radiobutton `` Half-life Units '' `` Biological '' radiobutton `` Half-lives . '' Also OLINDA , investigator select iodine-131 ( I-131 '' ) nuclide ( OLINDA 's `` Nuclide Input Form '' ) anatomic model closely approximating age total-body mass patient model ( OLINDA 's `` Model Input Form '' ) . Then , select `` Main Input Form '' click `` Doses '' button calculate organ dos effective dose . Evaluation Radiation exposure . Distributions primary outcome measure total body organ-specific radiation exposure ( describe ) summarize graphically ( boxplots ) numerically ( mean , standard deviation , median , interquartile range ) . Radiation exposure ( e.g. , absorb dose 131I total body specific organ ) compare across specific category administer dose 131I , well across age group , gender use Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) . The investigator also evaluate whether outcome difference study site . Should data comply distributional assumption require ANOVA , alternative non-parametric technique ( i.e . Kruskal-Wallis test ) consider . The investigator correlate administer dose 131I absorb dose radioactive agent , use Spearman 's Rank Correlation . In analysis , alpha 0.05 use . 2 . Primary aim ( 2 ) secondary aim ( ii ) : Assess chromosomal translocation child treat 131I evaluate chromosomal translocation related patient 's age 131I exposure . Low-level , whole body irradiation risk factor cancer 58 . The prolonged use certain medication associate risk cancer circumstance well . Current 131I therapy Graves ' disease child adults aims ablation sufficient amount thyroid gland result hypothyroid state . This treatment , though , also associate low-level whole body irradiation11 . Studies adult , treat 131I , reveal small increase rate stomach breast cancer . Although suggested child prone carcinogenic risk low level irradiation58 , study sufficient sample size assess long-term cancer risk child treat 131I . Recent data convincingly show chromosome translocation associate long-term cancer risk . Chromosome translocation molecular sign ionize radiation exposure . Importantly , translocation persist decade radiation exposure22 . This persistence make chromosomal translocation gold-standard aberration type perform radiation dosimetry lag time exposure assessment . Normative data chromosomal translocation available , related age gender20 . The investigator therefore propose perform observational cohort study child treat Graves ' disease ass chromosomal translocation . These study perform child dosimetry perform , detail . The investigator stratify enrollment gender age ensure comparable distribution characteristic . The chromosome translocation study , baseline 12 month-follow-up . Treatment 131I . Patients treat 131I detailed . Sample Collection . Blood obtain chromosome translocation analysis baseline 12 month treatment 131I , receive surgery ATDs . For blood collection , heparinized vacutainer use collect 5 ml blood . Blood obtain time routine phlebotomy assessment thyroid hormone level . 1 . Sample size calculation . The investigator test hypothesis translocation frequencies high subject receive 131I compare subject receive alternative treatment ( ATDs surgery ) GD . Since low level chromosomal break healthy children20 , increase chromosomal translocation possible detect significant increase relatively small sample size . Our estimate sample size base rate translocation describe Sigurdson observe rate 0.2 translocation per 100 cell equivalent child 20 . Given baseline rate use PASS 2005 module Poisson regression , investigator estimate sample size 135 child treat 131I 135 treat ATDs surgery provide 80 % power two-sided 0.05 significance level detect double chromosomal translocation rate two group patient 12 month tre . The investigator aim 1/3 child follow age group : 5-10 yr , 10-15 yr , 15-18 yr . The investigator enroll 150 subject group accommodate potential 10 % loss follow-up . 2 . FISH assay chromosome aberration . Personnel Dr. Tucker 's laboratory determine frequency chromosome translocation use Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ( FISH ) whole chromosome painting probe . All sample cod Tucker laboratory know radiation exposure history subject . Cell culture initiate 24-48 hr phlebotomy Dr. Tucker 's laboratory process accord routine cytogenetic method . Approximately 1,800 metaphase cell evaluate per subject , equivalent 1,800 x 0.56 = 1,000 metaphase cell ( define cell equivalent ; CEs ) full genome score . All translocation cell enumerate frequency translocation per 100 CEs use dependent variable statistical analysis . 3 . Data Analysis . Data analysis conduct collaboration Biostatistics Unit University Florida Center Clinical Investigation . All analysis perform use SAS v9.2 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) two-sided 0.05 type I error used evaluate statistical significance . Frequency distribution missingness examine variable . The investigator omit consideration analysis variables homogenous distribution high degree missingness collapse categorical variable underrepresented level . Associations independent variable examine use Spearman correlation coefficient , principal component hierarchical clustering ( PROC VARCLUS ) . Demographic ( age , gender race child primary caretaker ) , socioeconomic ( parental education income ) , clinical variable ( e.g. , duration Graves disease , ATD treatment , 131I dose ) compare two treatment group baseline use t-tests continuous variable chi-square test categorical variable . Meaningful clinical difference report adjusted multivariate analysis chromosomal translocation describe . ( ii ) Comparison Chromosomal Translocation Frequencies . The number chromosomal translocation baseline 12 month post treatment determine use mean confidence interval . These data also compare data healthy child . The investigator compare number chromosomal translocation baseline 12 month group multivariate model , use zero-inflated Poisson mixed model analysis69 . The zero-inflated Poisson model accommodates increase variance typical count data large proportion zero . Furthermore , inclusion random effect , mixed model analysis allow correlation repeat observation . The mixed model also accommodate individual incomplete observation ( i.e . lose follow-up ) assumption give observe data miss data dependent unobserved value . The following fixed effect use : treatment group ( 131I treatment vs. surgery ATD group ) , select covariates ( e.g. , child age gender , 131I dose , parental education income ) , time ( baseline 12months ) , time treatment group interaction . A random effect use account possible correlation number chromosomal translocation baseline 12 month subject . The investigator also explore whether effect treatment chromosomal translocation modify age child receive radiation dose , include three-way interaction term treatment , age time treatment , radiation dose time . Several strategy impose accommodate likelihood miss data occur study . Prevention obvious effective manner control bias loss power miss data . Postcard telephone visit reminder deliver participant prior protocol specify collection time . Alternative contact identify entry study minimize loss-to follow-up . Timely data entry combine weekly miss data report trigger protocol track obtain miss data item outcome assessment . Despite prevention effort , reasonable assume miss data occur . The primary analysis method use likelihood-based mixed model accommodate incomplete observation operate assumption miss data miss random ( MAR ) 69 . Missing data pattern reason dropout compare treatment group . T-tests , cross-tabulations logistic regression use evaluate whether withdrawal dependent observe variable . 4 . Statistical Considerations : Describe statistical analysis support study design . The investigator use Power Analysis Sample Size software ( PASS 2005 ) estimate precision around mean radiation exposure ( e.g. , expressed mean percent administer activity organ/total body Olinda-based mean organ absorb dose mean effective dose ) . A sample 150 subject produce 95 % confidence interval equal mean plus minus 0.16 standard deviation . From previously publish study child Graves disease ( age 7-18 year ) 42 , investigator estimate sample 150 patient stratified patient receive 150-200 Gy 200-300 Gy . Given proportion , investigator able estimate stratum-specific 95 % confidence interval around mean precision 0.32 standard deviation two small stratum 0.16 standard deviation large stratum .</detailed_description>
