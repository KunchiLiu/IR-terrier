	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn new image device help doctor decide lesion mouth pre-cancerous cancerous . The new imaging device use different color light mouth image .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proflavine : A Feasibility Study In Vivo Imaging Oral Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers look new way look mouth lesion use different light color magnification . The device study use different light color may help doctor decide mouth lesion high risk cancerous . Two ( 2 ) different kind device use study . One type design let researcher look wide area line mouth ( size top soda ) shin different color light mouth take picture . The device use multi-spectral digital microscope ( MDM ) , Identafi 3000 , portable screening system ( PS2 PS2.1 ) The second type imaging device use study design let researcher look take picture small area line mouth , size pencil tip , high magnification . This device call High-Resolution Microendoscope ( HRME ) . Also , color substance ( fluorescent dye glow green dark ) paint area mouth cotton tip applicator help improve picture . Women able become pregnant must negative blood ( 2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test participate study . Women breast feed nursing eligible participate study . Mouth Exam : If agree take part study , mouth exam . The study doctor take picture lesion inside mouth . The picture take standard white light . The study doctor take picture inside mouth use one first type imaging device ( MDM , Identafi 3000 , and/or PS2 ) depend device available time . It take 1 minute take picture . `` Normal '' ( non-lesion ) tissue mouth may also image . The picture take MDM and/or Identafi 3000 , and/or PS2 study good understand use different color light mouth image . A color substance ( proflavine ) use stain mouth tissue , make easy HRME take picture . Using cotton swab , study doctor brush 2 lesion 1 normal ( non-lesion ) area mouth proflavine . After 30 second , study doctor look take picture mouth area MDM , and/or Identafi 3000 , and/or PS2 . Then small probe ( size pencil tip ) HRME place lesion normal area inside mouth . Light end HRME probe use take picture stain tissue . The HRME procedure take less 1-2 minute tissue site . You rinse mouth water salt water procedure . The mouth exam lesion image do right schedule surgery . The imaging perform operating room right go sleep start surgery . However , may choose image performed awake . The whole procedure take 10 15 minute . It unlikely add amount time general anesthesia cause extra risk . Biopsies Tissue Removal : After image complete , tissue biopsy lesion scan , well normal area scan , check tissue cancerous pre-cancerous . These study biopsy perform already-scheduled surgery general anesthesia ( asleep ) . To collect tissue biopsy , small cut tool use remove tissue lesion . Each sample 4 millimeter wide ( size pencil eraser ) . These sample use test describe . After tissue biopsy take , lesion remove part schedule surgery . The clinical result test biopsy sample compare picture mouth tissue take HRME either MDM and/or Identafi 3000 and/or PS2 . You tell experimental finding study . However , result available doctor . All data ( tissue image diagnosis ) cod number , instead personal identifying information ( name medical record number ) , help ensure privacy . Length Study : The image tissue removal take around 10 15 minute . After tissue biopsy complete , active participation study . Researchers may contact routine follow-up visit see check problem image procedure . You may also contact telephone e-mail research personnel one year . This investigational study . The HRME , PS2 , MDM device FDA approve commercially available . Their use study investigational . The Identafi 3000 FDA approve commercially available . Proflavine FDA approve commercially available use dye mouth . Its use study investigational . Up 275 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
