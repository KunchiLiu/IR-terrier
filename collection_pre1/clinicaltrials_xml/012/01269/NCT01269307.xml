	<brief_title>Combination Ketamine Propofol v Propofol Emergency Department Sedation : A Prospective Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedural sedation ( PS ) common Emergency Department ( ED ) painful anxiety-producing procedure . In ED procedure commonly include fracture dislocation management reduction , abscess incision drainage , lumbar puncture , extensive wound debridement , dilatation curettage , chest tube placement cardioversion . Generally sedative-hypnotic agent combine analgesic order provide sedation . The ideal agent utilize remain unclear . The ED environment substantially different operative suite many outpatient area literature area limited applicability . In many ED 's , include , propofol combine either short acting long act narcotic become commonly utilized . Propofol many advantage include rapid onset , rapid recovery , strong sedative amnestic property , euphoric effect . However like many sedative-hypnotic posse strong respiratory depressive property cardio-depressant vasodilatation effect lead hypotension . These effect potentiate concomitant narcotic administration opioid agonists posse similar properties.2 ED literature complication associate propofol sedation variable , secondary significant difference rapidity administration medication , type analgesic provide , definition complication , amount pre-oxygenation provide , variability experience medical provider . Most literature suggest overall rate sub-clinical respiratory depression , measure indicator end-tidal CO2 change , approximately 30-40 % patients1-3 . The clinical importance change unclear . Clinical respiratory depression , measure hypoxemia , need verbal tactile stimulation , bag valve mask ventilation ( BVM ) , airway positioning , report 1-25 % patient , need BVM range 0-4.6 % patients1-6 . It noteworthy one study , utilize slow infusion rate long-acting narcotic administer great 20 minute prior start sedation , prospectively demonstrate 0.88 % rate hypoxemia 0 % rate BVM maintain similar total average dose , patient satisfaction , successful outcome6 . However replicate , data ED study seem suggest rate clinical respiratory depression 10-12 % BVM use average 4 % 1-6 . The clear conclusion drawn medical literature regard respiratory depression need airway management occur , rate likely heavily dependent exact protocol definition , make comparison center study difficult . Because interest develop effective sedation regimen might mitigate complication propofol plus narcotic regimen ( hereafter term propofol sedation ) , technique combine propofol ketamine describe use ED . This combination long-standing setting 7-10 use ED describe 9,12,13 . Ketamine dissociative hypnotic act bind N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor , block excitatory function . It analgesic , amnestic , dissociative , effect 9-12 . It beneficial property maintain respiratory drive , maintain muscular airway control still provide pain relief dissociation . Its use single agent ED sedation adult limit concern dysphoria anesthetic dos well post-sedation nausea vomit . It also cause tachycardia hypertension . However intuitive off-setting somewhat opposite side effect propofol ketamine create significant interest sedation regimens utilizing agent . ( ie propofol decrease heart rate ( HR ) , blood pressure ( BP ) , respiratory drive airway maintenance , euphoric anti-emetic . Ketamine increase HR , BP increase maintain respiratory drive airway maintenance , dysphoric nauseating . ) An ED study publish 2007 describing use fix dose mixture 1:1 propofol ketamine ( also term `` Ketofol '' ) single syringe , allow easy dose titration 12 . This study show high patient physician satisfaction ( mean 10 1-10 scale ) , high rate procedural success , extremely low rate complication ( 2.5 % rate hypoxemia , 0.9 % rate BVM ventilation ) 12 . Another study , child different dose parameter , recently suggest similarly low rate BVM ( 0 % ) high rate respiratory depression ( 15 % ) 13 . Interestingly study use low amount ketamine high dose propofol , perhaps contribute increased rate respiratory depression . Retrospective data use fix dose 1:1 ketamine propofol demonstrate similar safety profile 7 % patient respiratory depression require airway management absolute rate 2 % require BVM . We commonly use combination ED since 2007 . Currently ED propofol sedation ketamine plus propofol sedation variably employ , depend mainly prescriber preference . Because literature significant variability report complication rate two regimen , firm conclusion possible relative equivalence superiority one regimen compare . Attending physician preference currently dictate choice agent patient lieu robust evidence guide selection . Further , data measure relative patient satisfaction provider ease utilization either regimen , important factor selection sedation agent . We plan conduct prospective , randomize , equivalence trial fix ratio 1:1 ketamine propofol v propofol alone sedation . We measure sub-clinical clinical respiratory depression , need active airway management , unpleasant complication post-sedation nausea vomiting , dysphoria emergence reaction , patient provider satisfaction , post-procedure follow pain .</detailed_description>
