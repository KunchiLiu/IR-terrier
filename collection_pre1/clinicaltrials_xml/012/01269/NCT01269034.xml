There drug Exenatide ( Byetta ) FDA approve treat people type 2 diabetes help correct glucose ( sugar ) meal . This study go test whether drug improve meal sugar people new onset type 1 diabetes . To test give dose exenatide ( 1.25 mcg ) long act insulin inulin alone boost . There also placebo group ( healthy subject ) get medication boost . Insulin level hormone affect blood glucose well sugar measure series blood test . The role exenatide compare insulin alone examine prevent low blood sugar might occur food stay long stomach usual due suppression hormone call glucagon increase blood sugar . If qualify give exenatide ( Byetta 1.25 mcg ) along insulin insulin alone . You researcher know dose take single visit .

	<detailed_description>The specific aim study determine follow : 1 . The role exenatide compare insulin monotherapy reduce postprandial hyperglycemia . 2 . The role exenatide postprandial glucagon gastric empty . 3 . The effect long act insulin postprandial glucose excursion , glucagon concentration gastric empty . 4 . Postprandial glucose excursion , glucagon concentration gastric empty normal healthy control . Study Design : A randomized , non-blinded trial crossover design use . Following informed consent appropriate subject assent , subject screen visit . Following screen visit , subject T1DM undergo 3 study : Part A ( exenatide long act insulin ) , Part B ( rapid long act insulin ) Part C ( long act insulin ) . The subject admit CRC three separate occasion , least 3-4 week apart . The three study perform random order randomization do use computerized system . The healthy control undergo single study visit . Except absence diabetes , healthy control identical study subject . Subjects new onset diabetes compare healthy control . During study , blood glucose value subject less 55 mg/dl , IV glucose 5-15 gram administer achieve euglycemia ( 90-130 mg/dl ) . 1-2 dos IV glucose correct hypoglycemia . If 3 dos require achieve euglycemia , study terminate , subject offer meal tray blood sugar rechecked ensure euglycemia . If blood sugar time 350 moderate ketone , study terminate . At around 1 PM ( 270 min ) , lunch provide ( consistent carbohydrate meal ) insulin give per subject 's prescribed regimen . The subject discharge home designate driver due risk hypoglycemia . A subject withdrawn participate study he/she meet follow condition : 1 ) develop chronic disease 2 ) develop anemia 3 ) become pregnant 4 ) develops weight loss great 10 pound unspecified reason 5 ) loss contact- investigator unable reach study subject ( within 2 month screen completion first study ) phone mail schedule next appointment . All study subject ( withdrawn study ) receive phone call letter notify withdrawn .</detailed_description>
