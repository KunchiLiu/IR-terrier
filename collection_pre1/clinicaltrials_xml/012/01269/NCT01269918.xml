	<brief_title>A Comparison Remifentanil Dexmedetomidine Craniotomy Perioperative Hemodynamics Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anesthesia craniotomy present unique challenge anesthesiologist . Anesthesia neurosurgical procedure provide optimal surgical condition maintain appropriate cerebral oxygen supply stable systemic hemodynamics . ( 1 ) It important prevent patient response noxious stimuli procedure like pinning , drill bone , open manipulation dura etc. , avoid cough buck surgery extubation thus necessitate deep level anesthesia analgesia . At time desirable patient fully awake toward end surgery order facilitate neurologic evaluation . Management present challenge induction , maintenance extubation also multiple critical stage surgery Fear side effect analgesic drug frequently lead under-treatment post-craniotomy pain . ( 2 ) Nevertheless , pain continue commonly observe , frequently severe , , unrelieved , may cause distress neurosurgical patient serious complication operative brain . ( 2 ) There need large trial delineate safety efficacy analgesic therapy focus short- long-term outcome .</detailed_description>
