	<brief_title>The Effects Bindarit Preventing Stent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease cause gradual build-up fatty deposit coronary artery ( atherosclerosis ) . A diminished blood flow may cause chest pain ( angina ) , shortness breath symptom . A complete blockage cause heart attack . Angioplasty stenting technique safe effective procedure perform unblock coronary artery . However , recurrent problem angioplasty occurrence new blockage , usually within 6 9 month initial procedure . This phenomenon , call `` restenosis '' , body 's response injury angioplasty mean progression coronary artery disease.The pathophysiology restenosis complex yet fully clarify . Serial study show in-stent restenosis almost exclusively caused neointimal hyperplasia tissue proliferation occur site adjacent stent site . Histological study confirm neointimal hyperplasia post-stent implantation relate vessel injury procedure . Chemokines implicate pathogenesis vascular injury . In context , MCP-1 show potent chemotactic action monocyte , amplify inflammatory response recruitment additional monocyte . In addition , MCP-3 known share key biological feature MCP-1 . It prove MCP-1 directly induce human vascular smooth muscle proliferation act level potent mitogen , anti-MCP-1 gene therapy inhibit restenotic change ( neointimal hyperplasia ) animal balloon injury . An evidence critical increase circulate MCP-1 coronary angioplasty report . It evident prolong patient restenosis rather non-restenotic patient , transient increase plasma MCP-1 demonstrate . Since chemokines show play main role appearance worsen restenosis process , selective inhibitor MCP-1 member monocyte chemotactic protein subfamily CC inflammatory chemokines ( MCP-3/CCL7 , MCP-2/CCL8 ) , bindarit , may potential therapeutic use prevent restenosis inhibit VSMC proliferation , without affect important process re-endothelization .</detailed_description>
