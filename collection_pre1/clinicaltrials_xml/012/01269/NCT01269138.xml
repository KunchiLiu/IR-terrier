	<brief_summary>FVII deficiency rare coagulation disorder . A limited number patient find treatment centre country . Treatment demand vary considerably amongst FVII deficient patient . Therefore , regular clinical study meet recruitment problem particular patient population . The present study intend elucidate bleeding pattern well-defined collective FVII deficiency patient carefully characterise , document actual use different treatment modality different subgroup evaluate efficacy safety current available treatment modality bleeding , surgery prophylaxis . The purpose gain evidence base knowledge treatment patient FVII deficiency - area treatment decision make personal clinical experience consolidate clinical evidence . This study intend register treatment practice actually perform - structure documented way .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To describe treatment modality outcomes : − bleed episode − surgery − prophylaxis well define , international cohort FVII deficient patient characterise follow methodology use International Factor VII deficiency Study Group ( IF7SG ) . To evaluate presence ( already treat patient ) and/or appearance inhibiting antibody FVII and/or therapy-related thrombosis . Study Design : Prospective observational study treatment FVII deficiency patient . This outcome study conduct procedure set IF7SG , patient already enrol newly enrol database . Study population product : Patients FVII deficiency ( level FVII le 50 % normal mutation know associate FVII deficiency ) enrol . All pharmaceutical product consider useful treatment FVII deficiency centre include study . Key assessment : The database set capture follow assessment , available : Bleeding episode : • Recording bleed location , symptom onset treatment onset &amp; location • Recording substitution therapy , concomitant medication concomitant illness • Recording 6 hour treatment evaluation bleed episode • Recording re-bleeding episode Surgery/delivery : • Recording surgery description , date surgery indication • Recording substitution therapy , concomitant medication concomitant illness surgery • Recording antifibrinolytic drug use prior , and/or surgery •Recording • Recording overall treatment evaluation Prophylaxis : • Recording prophylaxis type ( primary/secondary ) , indication prophylaxis start/stop date •Recording prophylaxis therapy , concomitant medication concomitant illness • Recording bleed episode prophylaxis •Recording clinical prophylaxis evaluation For : - Laboratory value ( PT/INR , APTT , FVII : C , platelet count , fibrinogen , inhibitor sample ) time point specify section 7.3 . - Adverse event ( include thrombotic event , anaphylactic reaction , DIC reaction , Re- bleeding mortality ) - Recording 30 day treatment evaluation ( excellent , effective , partly effective , ineffective evaluable ) - Duration hospital stay ( ward , ICU ) within 30 day first product treatment • Mortality within 30days first product administration</detailed_description>
