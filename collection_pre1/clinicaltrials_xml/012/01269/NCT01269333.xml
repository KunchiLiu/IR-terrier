	<brief_summary>Clopidogrel platelet inhibitor widely use particularly acute coronary event coronary intervention . Several study show patient resistant clopidogrel . The resistance mechanism entirely clear yet , least part related interaction medication . Omeprazole member family gastric proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) widely use patient receive combination aspirin clopidogrel order protect stomach lining prevent GI bleeding . Data study platelet aggregation indicate treatment omeprazole may cause partial resistance clopidogrel increase risk recurrent cardiovascular event patient coronary intervention . Recently FDA publish struck avoid cross clopidogrel omeprazole treatment fear reduction efficiency . Nevertheless several study support increase risk cardiovascular event among patient take omeprazole clopidogrel , COGENT trial single prospective control study assess clinical implication drug interaction . The accepted Mechanism interaction omeprazole clopidogrel disturbance create clopidogrel active metabolite CYP2C19 inhibition omeprazole . fluvoxamine - member SSRIs family potent inhibitor CYP2C19 . In vivo study compare degree decomposition proguanil ( CYP2C19 indicator ) fluvoxamine omeprazole find constant inhibition- Ki = 10 Micromol / L Omeprazole versus constant inhibition- Ki = 0.69 Micromol / L fluvoxamine . This indicate potent inhibition CYP2C19 vivo fluvoxamine compare omeprazole . It important note far date literature study demonstrate interaction fluvoxamine CYP2C19 inhibitor Clopidogrel . Research goal : - To assess impact fluvoxamine omeprazole platelet reactivity healthy individual treat clopidogrel . - To verify weather mechanism omeprazole-clopidogrel interaction relate CYP2C19 inhibition . Study design : Randomized blind placebo-controlled crossover trial healthy volunteer . The response clopidogrel assess use two method subject receive clopidogrel one study drug : fluvoxamine , omeprazole placebo .</brief_summary>
