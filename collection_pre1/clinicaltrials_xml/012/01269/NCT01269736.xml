	<brief_title>Implementation Practice Standards ECG Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advance hospital electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring technology , monitoring practice inconsistent often inadequate . The investigator recently publish practice standard ECG monitoring . The primary purpose 5-year multisite randomize clinical trial test effect implementing standard nurse ' knowledge skill , quality care , patient outcome . The investigator expect increase knowledge skill nurse lead enhance quality care , result improve outcome patient . Units serve cardiac patient 17 hospital participate . Hospitals randomize experimental control group baseline measure knowledge skill , quality care , patient outcome obtain . The intervention include ECG monitor education strategy implement sustain change . The online education include 4 module : essential ECG monitoring , arrhythmia monitoring , ischemia monitoring , QT interval monitoring . The strategy implement sustain change clinical area include reinforcement education , incentive , designation `` champion '' unit actively promote implementation practice standard .</detailed_description>
