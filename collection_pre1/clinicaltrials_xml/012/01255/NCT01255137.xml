	<brief_summary>Background : - Adrenocortical carcinoma aggressive cancer start adrenal gland top kidney . It low survival rate standard treatment option effective . Axitinib experimental drug study determine stop tumor grow make small . Researchers interested investigate axitinib individual aggressive otherwise untreatable adrenocortical cancer . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness axitinib individual adrenocortical cancer inoperable respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose adrenocortical cancer respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen full physical examination medical history , well tumor image study . - Participants may tumor biopsy prior start axitinib . - All participant receive axitinib take twice day food 28 day ( 1 cycle ) . Participants drink grapefruit juice smoke cigarettes participate study . - After first cycle , dose may increase additional cycle give treatment serious side effect . - Participants regular examination take axitinib , include blood sample tumor image study determine tumor stop grow . Blood pressure level carefully monitor treatment evaluate potential risk high blood pressure . - Participants may second tumor biopsy 20 30 day treatment begin . - Treatment continue direct study researcher .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Axitinib ( AG-013736 ) With Evaluation VEGF-Pathway Metastatic , Recurrent Primary Unresectable Adrenocortical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - The response rate recurrent , metastatic unresectable adrenocortical cancer ( ACC ) mitotane , doxorubicin , etoposide , cisplatin low underscore need effective systemic therapy . - VEGF expression evidence angiogenesis find many ACCs , plausible interfere vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) signaling may result anti-tumor activity patient ACC . - Axitinib ( AG-013736 ) oral , potent selective inhibitor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptors 1 , 2 , 3 . Pre-clinical data suggest anti-tumor activity axitinib may result anti-angiogenic activity reversible treatment discontinue . - Given known clinical safety efficacy axitinib , assessment activity ACC impact VEGF pathway ACC could provide valuable information . Objectives : - Determine response rate axitinib ( AG-013736 ) recurrent , metastatic , primary unresectable ACC - Determine progression-free survival - Explore relationship potential biological marker axitinib activity clinical outcome . - Explore pharmacogenetic analysis drug metabolism transport proteins germline deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) examination . Eligibility : - Adults pathologic confirmation ACC Laboratory Pathology , National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) - Diagnosis recurrent , metastatic , primary unresectable ACC - Measurable disease presentation - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 - Patients must receive prior therapy tyrosine kinase ( TK ) inhibitor Design : - Phase II , open label , non-randomized trial - Patients recurrent , metastatic , primary unresectable ACC give eight week cycle BID dose axitinib ( AG-013736 ) . - Patients evaluate response every eight week use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . - Tumor biopsy mandatory every attempt make obtain patient prior start axitinib 20-30 day treatment begin . - Approximately 40 patient need achieve objective trial .</detailed_description>
