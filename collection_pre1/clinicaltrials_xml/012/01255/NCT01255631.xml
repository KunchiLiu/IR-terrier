	<brief_summary>The important prognostic indicator breast cancer patient axillary lymph node status . With introduction sentinel lymph node biopsy , many woman spar morbidity full axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) axillary node assess low false negative rate . Approximately 30 % woman undergo ALND experience shoulder/arm morbidity include numbness , pain , weakness decrease range motion . In addition , sentinel lymph node dissection ( SLND ) hold promise woman early stage breast cancer would able avoid dread morbidity associate axillary lymph node dissection include lymphedema , decrease range motion pain . Since adoption SLN , numerous paper document SLN superior ALND . However , patient undergo SLN still significant amount pain procedure . There publish study objectively assess subjective objective symptom SLND . Pulsed electromagnetic field ( PEMF ) show effective treatment fracture spinal fusion , relief pain acute sprain whiplash injury , improvement skin blood flow , heal venous stasis ulcer , reduction postmastectomy lymphedema . Indeed , radiofrequency PEMF device FDA approve pain edema relief . PEMF device economical disposable , incorporate unobtrusively standard post-op dressing . We recently report , double-blind , placebo-controlled study breast reduction , post-op PEMF therapy produce significant decrease pain pain medication use , along concomitant decrease IL1-beta wound bed.1 The current pilot study design determine PEMF treatment , give addition standard care , reduce post-operative discomfort morbidity lumpectomy SLND , lumpectomy ALND . Lumpectomy ALND/SLND patient enrol double-blind , placebo-controlled study undergo standard surgery , randomize one two group : treatment group PEMF coil place around arm control group coil delivers PMF . We expect postoperative pain reduce PEMF-treated patient well improve arm mobility strength . The use PEMF might reduce need narcotic pain medication side effect sedation , nausea , vomit . It may also reduce cost related arm morbidity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In treatment arm , PEMF would automatically deliver 15 minute every two hour one month . The manufacturer ( Ivivi Technologies , Inc. , Northvale , NJ ) already design lightweight , disposable device place around patient 's arm tap place . The patient would keep device place two week , return followup visit receive fresh device wear additional two week .</detailed_description>
