	<brief_summary>The rationale evaluate LucentisTM ( recombinant humanize anti-human Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) monoclonal antibody ( Fab ) patient neovascular ( wet ) Age related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) base strong correlation VEGF level aqueous vitreous humor active blood vessel formation . LucentisTM show maintain improve vision wet AMD . Since treatment halt loss visual acuity wet AMD , important accurately measure anatomic response treatment thereby enhance ability understand pattern response predict necessity continue therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Ability provide write informed consent comply study assessment full duration study Subjects either gender , Age &gt; 50 year Best correct visual acuity study eye 20/40 20/320 . Subfoveal choroidal neovascularization , secondary age relate macular degeneration . Any subretinal hemorrhage must comprise 50 % total lesion size . Clear ocular medium adequate papillary dilation permit good quality stereoscopic fundus photography Men must use barrier contraception abstinence throughout study . Ability return study visit Had ocular surgery within past 60 day study eye . Had previous refractive eye surgery ( RK , PRK , LASIK , ALK , etc . ) within past 3 month study eye . Has intraocular pressure â‰¥ 25 mmHg study eye . Has posterior uveitis study eye . Has ongoing infection study eye . Has retinal optic nerve disease could independently affect visual acuity include high axial myopia ( &gt; 8.00 D ) diabetic retinopathy study eye . Has anterior segment vitreous abnormality would preclude adequate observation fundus photograph fluorescein angiography study eye . Has receive investigational therapy within 60 day prior study entry . Has previously enrol previous treatment MSI1256F injection . Has receive prior approve treatment subfoveal CNV within 60 day study entry . Has clinically uncontrolled diabetes mellitus . Has condition investigator considers sound reason exclusion ( e.g. , lack motivation , history poor compliance , concomitant illness , personality disorder , mental condition , drug abuse , use neuroleptic , physical social condition predict difficulty longterm followup ) .
