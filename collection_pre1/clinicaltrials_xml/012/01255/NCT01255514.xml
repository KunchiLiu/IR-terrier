	<brief_summary>Complete Response ( CR ) plus near CR rate VAD ( Vincristine , Adriamycin , Dexamethasone ) induction chemotherapy follow ASCT patient newly diagnose MM 50 % CR plus near CR rate PAD ( Bortezomib , Adriamycin , Dexamethasone ) induction chemotherapy follow ASCT patient newly diagnose MM 60 % . If CR near CR rate sequential high-dose dexamethasone response adopt PAD VAD induction chemotherapy follow ASCT 60 % , combination accept active regimen may worth investigate phase III trial . But , CR near CR rate regimen low 50 % , merit VAD induction chemotherapy . Based upon assumption , trial design use Simon 's optimal two-stage test procedure . Assuming target level interest , p1=0.6 , low activity level , p0=0.5 . Initially 61 patient accrue . If 33 CR + near CR rate observe , trial continue . Accrual plan total 190 patient . If total 106 patient assessed CR near CR , sequential high-dose dexamethasone response adopt PAD VAD induction chemotherapy regimen accept active regimen . This design provide probability 0.05 accept drug bad p0 probability 0.20 rejecting drug well p1 . If assume drop-out rate 10 % , total accrual patient 210 . Patient characteristic toxicity evaluate descriptive method . Progression free survival overall survival ( median value , 95 % confidence interval ) calculate Kaplan-Meier method .</brief_summary>
