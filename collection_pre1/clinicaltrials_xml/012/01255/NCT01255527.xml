	<brief_summary>Despite advantage autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) conventional chemotherapy,1,2 result high-dose chemoradiotherapy multiple myeloma ( MM ) still unsatisfactory 6-year event free survival ( EFS ) 24 % . Based exist data , bortezomib-containing regimen currently accept many center induction treatment option patient symptomatic MM , particularly plan offer subsequent high-dose therapy ASCT . So use bortezomib-containing regimen induction prior novel condition regimen . The objective present study compare toxicity therapeutic efficacy new high-dose regimen use dose-escalation BOR , BU MEL ASCT Korean patient MM . The patient treat bortezomib-containing regimen induction therapy ASCT . We specifically analyze ( ) efficacy condition regimen improve pre-ASCT status , response rate ( ii ) engraftment transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) ( iii ) impact survival include progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . Triple combination condition enhance response rate ASCT , improve PFS , also OS . We think data study may strengthen feasibility BOR conditioning prior ASCT .</brief_summary>
