	<brief_summary>Pregestational diabetes ( PGD ) pregnancy may associate increased rate spontaneous abortion , intrauterine death congenital anomaly among offspring . Although prevalence congenital anomaly among offspring diabetic mother reduce result improvement glycemic control early pregnancy , rate congenital anomaly increase seem increased rate neurodevelopmental disorder include fine gross motor deficit well increased rate inattention and/or hyperactivity . In gestational diabetes , develop second half pregnancy ( past period major organogenesis ) , seem increase rate major congenital anomaly developmental disorder offspring . The exposure develop embryo fetus diabetic environment ( i.e . hyperglycemia , hyperketonemia ext ) , know cause increase oxidative stress significant change gene expression observe several experimental diabetic model . We hypothesize diabetic environment may also cause long lasting epigenetic change . It therefore purpose evaluate possible epigenetic change correlate presence degree time onset diabetes , ( i.e . whether begin PGD second half pregnancy GD ) , degree oxidative stress neurodevelopmental outcome offspring . Diabetic pregnancy compare similar number normal pregnancy parameter study .</brief_summary>
