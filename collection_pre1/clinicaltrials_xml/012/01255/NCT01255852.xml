	<detailed_description>Severe intracranial atherosclerosis concomitant stenosis responsible approximately 10 % stroke . In Asian population intracranial stenosis even commonly find vascular lesion . Retrospective study indicate 50 % patient recently symptomatic intracranial stenosis experience recurrent ischemic event . The risk recurrent stroke increase aggravation intracranial artery stenosis . In Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease ( WASID ) trial , 14 % 23 % patient TIA stroke attributable high-grade intracranial stenosis ipsilateral ischemic stroke next year despite best medical treatment . If percentage intracranial stenosis exceed 70 % , stroke risk go 20 % first year . These result spur enthusiasm endovascular approach , include percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty ( PTA ) stenting treat potentially harmful disease . Due high stroke risk , patient high-grade ≥70 % symptomatic intracranial stenosis represent main target group endovascular treatment . Endovascular management intracranial arthrosclerosis , however , associate appreciable number potential complication , include local thrombosis , thromboembolism , especially , restenosis in-stent occlusion . To date , report 1-year restenosis rate intracranial stenting case series small trial vary widely , range less 10 % 50 % others . According recent review , overall 1-year restenosis rate intracranial stenting 25 % , in-stent occlusion rate nearly 10 % . These relatively high rate restenosis re-occlusion procedure raise question whether stenting improves natural course intracranial atherosclerosis . Compared relatively good durability angioplasty stenting procedure within extracranial carotid artery , high incidence restenoses appear major drawback intracranial stenting . Recent study suggest especially young patient treat self-expandable stent within anterior circulation high risk complication . Considering 33 % restenoses symptomatic ( TIA stroke ) , decrease restenosis rate intracranial stenting become key issue improve clinical feasibility treatment strategy . Animal study indicate statin inhibit platelet aggregation release platelet-derived mediator , reduce inflammatory response vascular wall , improve artery endothelial function , may contribute decrease proliferative response stent implantation . These profile make statin optimal prevent restenosis occlusion intracranial stenting , strategy test clinical trial date , although statin prove several recent clinical trial efficacious prevent restenosis stent implantation coronary artery . The initial attempt low restenosis rate coronary balloon angioplasty fail demonstrate beneficial effect statin therapy , although FLuvastatin Angioplasty REstenosis ( FLARE ) trial report reduction mortality myocardial infarction fluvastatin treatment patient . Subsequent study , however , confirm statin therapy decrease restenosis rate related ischemic event stent implantation patient coronary artery disease . Unlike chronic vessel shrinkage may account ≥70 % recurrence rate balloon angioplasty , restenosis coronary stent implantation entirely due neointimal proliferation . Experimental study show statin capable inhibit intimal proliferation arterial injury . Results study suggest statin interfere proliferative response coronary stent implantation human . Statin therapy associate significant reduction late lumen loss , also great net gain coronary stent implantation . Thus , discrepancy effect statin therapy restenosis development balloon angioplasty compare coronary stent implantation may easily reconcile different mechanism underlie recurrence luminal narrowing . Elevated LDL cholesterol level increase platelet red-cell aggregability , thrombosis believe decisive role process restenosis in-stent occlusion . Lowering LDL cholesterol level decrease rate restenosis rat-carotid model , whereas treatment statin decrease progression disease rabbit-iliac model independently effect LDL cholesterol . In contrast , overstretched-swine-coronary model , relation either LDL cholesterol statin restenosis observe . An attempt make resolve conflict prospective clinical study 157 patient treat without statin . The result indicate rate restenosis 12 percent 44 percent without statin . More one study also identify diagnosis hypercholesterolemia time coronary stent implantation major independent predictor reduce recurrence rate . But recent study indicate statin therapy associate comparable reduction restenosis rate patient average serum cholesterol level baseline , suggest observe effect due reduce serum cholesterol level , also may relate non-lipid anti-atherosclerotic property statins . Since efficacy high dose statin prevent restenosis coronary artery stenting confirm several clinical trial , reasonable presume high-dose statin also efficacious prevent restenosis in-stent occlusion intracranial stenting , two vasculatures share similar anatomical profile . The present study aim evaluate preventive effect atorvastatin 80 mg daily decrease restenosis consecutive series patient undergoing intracranial stent implantation single center . The hypothesis study patient atorvastatin therapy associate improved clinical outcome reduce restenosis rate 12 month intracranial stent implantation patient without atorvastatin therapy .</detailed_description>
