	<detailed_description>The study do 2 phase : Phase I : Development SMS text message The SMS message use trial develop pre-tested focus group discussion convenience sample subject similar target population understandability acceptability . Phase II : Parallel group , open-label , randomize , control trial Target Population Hypertensive patient see General Medicine Outpatient Clinic public , tertiary , university hospital Manila , Philippines Sampling Method A criterion sample strategy use study . Patients fulfill eligibility criterion recruit consecutively desire sample size reach . Randomization Allocation Concealment Eligible patient randomize one two treatment group use computer-generated random allocation sequence . Allocation treatment do third party use sequential , seal opaque envelope . Blinding Given nature intervention , patient blind treatment group . However , measure take blind physicians manage participant clinic . Outcome assessor also blind participant ' treatment group . Procedures Measurements Written , inform consent obtain prior enrolment study . Once eligible participant give consent , randomize either intervention control arm trial third party use sequentially number opaque envelope . At end 12-week follow period , participant ask return final study visit , blood pressure medication adherence measure . Acceptability SMS intervention also determine use structure questionnaire . A period four week schedule date final visit allow patient consider lose follow-up . Intervention : SMS reminder Patients intervention arm receive 2 text message per week deliver via SMS randomly choose day time 12-week study period . The aim message remind patient take blood pressure medication daily , target blood pressure , benefit daily intake anti-hypertensive medication . Successful contact assume `` Message send '' see screen . Otherwise , text message shall immediately resent maximum 3 time . Receipt message free study participant independent telephone service provider . Control : Usual Care Routine usual care hypertensive patient General Medicine Outpatient clinic base Seventh Report Joint National Committee Prevention , Detection , Evaluation , Treatment High Blood Pressure . This consist physician visit , advice medication prescription healthcare provider . It include send SMS message encourage adherence provide information regard hypertension . Outcome Measurements Blood Pressure Blood pressure measure use calibrate digital sphygmomanometer manufacture Omron participant seat quietly five minute . The average two reading take five minute apart record . Medication Adherence The Adherence Self-Report Questionnaire ( ASRQ ) , brief , validated , self-administered questionnaire , use measure medication adherence . Participants ask complete Filipino translation ASRQ . Acceptability SMS Messages Acceptability SMS message measure use brief , self-administered questionnaire . Planned Analysis Descriptive statistic baseline characteristic , adherence score , adherence rate group ( mean , sd , frequency ( % ) , median ) compute . Between-group comparison do baseline check similarity baseline characteristic , end 12 week test hypothesis inequality two population . All hypothesis test one-sided level significance set 0.05 . Intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis do , possible sensitivity analysis drop-outs . All statistical computation compute use Stata statistical software . Sample Size The NCSS-PASS statistical software use compute desire sample size . The sample size require fulfill objective study 286 subject per group . Allowing loss follow approximately 20 % , final sample size 350 subject per group ( total 700 subject ) . Ethical Considerations Ethics approval obtain prior conduct study . Written inform consent obtain participant prior enrolment . Good clinical practice guideline follow course study . At begin trial , emphasise communication SMS study one-way ( provider patient ) , reply text message receive participant . The participant also advise consult physician problem may experience .</detailed_description>
