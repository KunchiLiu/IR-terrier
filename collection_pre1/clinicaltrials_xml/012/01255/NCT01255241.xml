	<brief_summary>Lower Limb Deformities ( LLDF ) rather common infirmity among child . LLDF may result various condition trauma , tumor , infection , dysplasia , congenital metabolic abnormality . It assume correction deformity surgical procedure improve ambulation reduce energy expenditure . This prospective study document process establish initial localization magnitude deformity physical radiological examination , kinetic kinematical parameter , measure energy expenditure . The study also document type surgical intervention undertaken correct deformity . Following recovery surgery , child 's ambulation assess , physical radiological examination , kinetic kinematical parameter , measure energy expenditure . A third series exam perform four month later . It expect surgical intervention improve ambulation reduce energy expenditure . This study aim establish model enable assess ambulation energy expenditure surgical intervention . The result study may practical implication decision type surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Lower Limb Deformities ( LLD ) Children 's Gait Energy Expenditure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patient , age range six eighteen year study kinetic kinematic parameter ass initial status ambulation . Energy expenditure measure metabolic monitoring . Patients undergo need surgical intervention ambulation re-assessed parameter upon recovery , four month later . All patient /or parent sign inform consent form . Patients LLDF subdivide accord anatomic localization deformity ( proximal femur , distal femur , femoral shaft , proximal tibia , distal tibia , tibial shaft , combine complex deformity ) deformity plane ( frontal , sagittal , axial , oblique ) . The patient undergo complete physical routine examination . The deformity plane , localization magnitude define radiological measurement physical examination . Rotational profile determine physical examination . Patients meet inclusion criterion undergo first gait analysis . Patients walk flat floor , establish locomotion base line , ass joint range motion ( ROM ) ambulation ( kinematics ) , record moment power joint ( kinetics ) . While walk flat floor , first measurement energy expenditure make . Subsequently child walk treadmill connect metabolic monitor . Patients undergo require type surgical correction deformity . Following recovery , include regain range motion ( ROM ) , antalgic gait , patient undergo second gait analysis Energy expenditure measurement , schedule two four month surgery accord type od surgical intervention . The third gait lab energy expenditure exams perform four month afterwards . The result analyze compare obtain prior intervention . The overall time study plan 24 month . Results analyze ANOVA post hoc test .</detailed_description>
