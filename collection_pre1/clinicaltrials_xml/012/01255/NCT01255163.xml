	<brief_summary>Background : - Exendin-4 ( Exenatide ) medication currently use treat diabetes , show promising result test effectiveness protect neuron damage process associate Alzheimer disease . It possible Exendin-4 may treatment Alzheimer disease , involve gradual deterioration death neuron . Researchers interested study safety compare effect Exendin-4 placebo congestive performance , overall clinical progression , various chemical measure blood cerebrospinal fluid , brain MRI , individual early-stage Alzheimer 's disease mild cognitive impairment . Objectives : - To determine safety tolerability , well acquire preliminary evidence effectiveness twice daily administration Exendin-4 treatment early-stage Alzheimer disease mild cognitive impairment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 60 year age objective evidence early-stage Alzheimer 's disease mild cognitive impairment screen test . Design : - Participants screen . - Following telephone screen , two in-person screen visit determine eligibility . - The screening visit involve medical history neurological examination , test memory cognition , lumbar puncture , collection blood saliva sample , brain Magnetic Resonance Imagine ( MRI ) study . Participants require appoint Durable Power Attorney research medical care protocol . - Eligible participant divide two group . One group receive Exendin-4 , receive placebo . Participants keep medication diary schedule additional study visit 1 2 week start treatment . - Participants regular followup visit blood test , image study , examination 6 , 12 , and18 month start treatment . Another lumbar puncture may perform optionally 18-month followup visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Clinical Trial Exendin-4 Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Exendin-4 ( exenatide ) medication currently use treatment diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . Exendin-4 generate promising result agent protect neuron number assault laboratory study animal . Specifically , pre-clinical evidence Exendin-4 may treatment Alzheimer disease ( AD ) . Based fact , propose pilot Phase II double blind randomize placebo-controlled clinical study ass safety provide proof concept efficacy exendin-4 treatment early Alzheimer disease ( AD ) , demonstrate response disease biomarkers intervention . Our main hypothesis long-term administration Exendin-4 participant amnestic MCI/early AD FDA-approved dose safe induce change time AD biomarkers . Subject population : We intend screen 100 potential participant order ensure least 40 participant ( enrol base clinical diagnosis amnestic MCI/early AD Cerebrospinal Fluid ( CSF ) biomarker evidence AD ) enrol treatment complete study . Design : Enrolled participant randomly assign one two group ( Exendin-4 v . Placebo ) follow regular interval 18 month . Outcome measure : Safety tolerability primary outcome . In addition , measure ass change time number exploratory outcome intervention , include CSF plasma biochemical biomarkers ( CSF BDNF , A42 , tau , p181-tau plasma A42/A40 ) , cognitive performance measure ( Alzheimer Disease Assessment scale , cognitive sub-scale , test ) , overall clinical progression measure ( Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum-of-boxes ) , volumetric change structural brain MRI change default mode network activation rest fMRI . All research perform National Institute Aging ( NIA ) Clinical Research Unit locate 5th floor Harbor Hospital .</detailed_description>
