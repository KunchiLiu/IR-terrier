	<detailed_description>1.0 INTRODUCTION - Shortly introduction allogeneic HSCT clinical practice , recognize standard pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) sensitive enough detect HSCT-related respiratory complication [ PMID : 2661259 ; PIMD : 8823260 ] . Accordingly , find progressive obstructive abnormality new onset consider functional hallmark obliterative bronchiolitis ( OB ) [ PMID : 16338616 ; PMID : 19896545 ] . As result , routinely perform spirometry propose non-invasive tool monitor risk OB HSCT population [ PMID : 17470622 ] . Yet , due peripheral airway involvement OB , sensitivity conventional PFTs early detection OB low [ PMID : 2298060 ] . For instance , exceed 75 % lung-transplanted population decrease force expiratory volume 1 ( FEV1 ) may occur stage process already irreversible potentially life-threatening [ PMID : 9246138 ] . 2.0 EXPERIMENTAL HYPOTHESIS - Because branch pattern bronchial tree result increasingly large number small airways luminal diameter le 2 mm peripheral generation , airway contribute little total pulmonary resistance [ PMID : 5442364 ; PMID : 651978 ] . Intuitively , large proportion small airway may damage obliterate without impair conventional PFTs . In regard , previous study [ PMID : 12186817 ] point index ventilation distribution may provide early evidence OB lung transplantation . In particular , author [ PMID : 12186817 ] find test ventilation distribution invariably deteriorate 1 yr 20 % decrease FEV1 apparent . Previous study [ PMID : 970731 ; PMID : 507525 ] show total respiratory input impedance ( Zrs ) , measure forced oscillation technique ( FOT ) spontaneous breathing , may particularly sensitive small change lung mechanic observe early stage smoking-related airflow obstruction . Subsequently , develop modify FOT identify within-breath difference Zrs , value Zrs represent sum respiratory system resistance ( Rrs ) reactance ( Xrs ) , latter imaginary part former [ PMID : 14979497 ; PMID : 19164347 ] . This method allow assessment breath add potential quantitative evaluation instantaneous inspiratory expiratory Rrs Xrs external intervention deep inspiration , bronchodilator drug , etc . Although effect identify within-breath analysis perform [ PMID : 14979497 ] , publish report oscillatory mechanic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) report total respiratory cycle data [ PMID : 1519830 ; PMID : 10489847 ] . 3.0 STUDY RATIONALE - The aim present study test hypothesis : 1. post-HSCT change within-breath Rrs Xrs may provide early evidence OB standard PFTs . Indeed , obliteration terminal bronchiole , observe 48 % OB patient follow HSCT [ PMID : 17470622 ] , could make real part Zrs abnormally high [ PMID : 5653219 ] ventilation heterogeneous ; 2. post-HSCT change airway responsiveness acute bronchoactive intervention deep inspiration total lung capacity and/or bronchodilator drug ( i.e. , albuterol ) may detect modify FOT . We speculate change may represent early sign OB . Although previous study group fail find increase airway responsiveness HSCT without pulmonary complication [ PMID : 18684842 ] , recently show airway smooth muscle tone may play active role airflow obstruction OB [ PMID : 20724742 ] . 4.0 STUDY DESIGN - Before regular interval ( 2-4 wk onward ) HSCT , patient attend laboratory perform PFTs measurement order . Firstly , patient breathe spontaneously modify FOT system 5 min , without disconnect apparatus , perform inspiratory capacity maneuver soon resume spontaneous breathe next 2 min . Subsequently , spirometry , transmural total body plethysmography CO diffusing capacity lung ( standard PFTs ) take triplicate . Thirty minute inhale four separate dos 100 Î¼g albuterol , modify FOT measurement standard PFTs repeat anew .</detailed_description>
