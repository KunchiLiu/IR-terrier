	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine impact voice therapy voice-related quality life child age 6-10 year old apparent vocal fold nodule , measure validate Pediatric Voice-Related Quality Life Instrument ( PVRQOL ) administer 4 week completion voice therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Voice Children With Vocal Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Voice disorder place five million school-aged child increase risk inferior school performance , dysfunctional social development , high participation criminal activity . The lesion commonly associate pediatric vocal dysfunction report vocal fold nodule , present 21 % general pediatric population associate behavioral problem inferior quality life . Voice therapy speech-language pathologist recommend 95 % otolaryngologists management vocal fold nodule . When implement , voice therapy require significant time investment typically result regular absence classroom period 1-3 month longer , depend protocol setting . Regular absence school show place child risk poor scholastic performance benefit voice therapy yet demonstrate rigorous prospective , controlled trial . Thus , widely use treatment common lesion associate pediatric voice disorder rigorously test randomize control trial determine whether may benefit . A randomized clinical trial address whether voice therapy improve voice-related quality life child apparent vocal fold nodule logical step toward develop evidence-based treatment plan optimize outcome sizable population at-risk child . There currently well-powered , prospective , controlled study compare voice therapy versus control child present apparent nodule . Our goal remedy deficiency test follow primary null hypothesis : There difference change PVRQOL score 3 month treatment voice therapy versus office instruction .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion 1 . Eligibility contingent presence apparent vocal fold nodule , define bilateral , localize , benign , superficial growth protrusion medial surface true vocal fold junction anterior middle third . This examination base videostroboscopic examination , , rare case , operative microsuspension laryngoscopy . In addition , strict exclusion criterion apply toward exclude mass nodule . Defining characteristic inclusion criterion base upon evaluation three senior otolaryngologist participant 's exam . Children evaluate senior otolaryngologist institution suspect vocal fold nodule candidate inclusion study . Patient deidentified image stroboscopy review two laryngologists ; child confirm vocal fold nodule three senior otolaryngologist consider entry study . 2 . Children 6 to10 year age enrol . The rationale age range previously note . In brief , child age range ( ) similar educational social exposure ; ( b ) likely yet encounter pubertal change affect larynx ; ( c ) relatively cognitively homogeneous . Moreover , child age range ability cooperate voice therapy also show tolerant stroboscopic examination . Finally , voice therapy regimen protocol show clinically effective many child age range . 3 . Voicerelated quality life must affect extent baseline PVRQOL score &lt; 87.5 ( scale worst , 0 , best , 100 ) time entry trial . Based previously publish data , subset score clearly distinct score child normal voice . In addition , score &lt; 87.5 represent bad average score among child diagnose vocal fold nodule . 4 . Dysphonia duration prior randomization must least 12 week , order ensure vocal dysfunction chronic nature . 5 . Hearing good ear 35 dB well . 6 . Agreement inform consent parent inform assent child participant anticipate commitment compliance throughout follow period 3 month necessary enrollment include time commitment 3 hour per week therapy session homework . 7 . Vocal fold nodule pathology predominantly affect male . A number study databases utilized track pathology clinical site indicate male : female ratio approximately 7:3 . Given background , enrollment plan current investigation seek 30 % female representation patient enrol study ensure appropriate gender representation . Additionally , patient diagnosis pediatric vocal fold nodule predominantly find Caucasian population . However , accordance National Institute Health Revitalization Act 1993 inclusion minority proposal target representation minority great Boston , Philadelphia Milwaukee metropolitan region . Exclusion criteria 1 . Children nonstandard nodule mass unequivocally nodule exclude , include irregular epithelium , concern malignancy require biopsy , rapid growth pattern , airway obstruction require urgent operative intervention , prior laryngeal surgery . Furthermore , since several lesion present bilateral true vocal fold mass ( unilateral cyst polyps contralateral fibrovascular reaction , contact granuloma , Reinke 's edema ) , mass follow characteristic exclude : ) yellow blue color suggestive mucous fluidfilled component , b ) pink friable lesion posterior aspect true vocal fold , c ) watery edematous expansion without distinct protrusive mass . Defining characteristic exclusion criterion determine corroborated evaluation three senior otolaryngologist participant 's videostroboscopic exam . This examination base videostroboscopy , , rare case , operative microsuspension laryngoscopy . The video image place passwordprotected server three senior investigator access ; video image contain patient identify information rather study number assign participant . In addition , strict inclusion criterion apply toward exclude mass nodule . 2 . Children previously receive form speech therapy target voice and/or resonance exception articulation speech therapy . 3 . Children voice therapy protocols problematic exclude : developmental delay , cognitive disorder , behavioral disorder , neurologic disorder , articulation disorder , phonological disorder , language disorder , expressive and/or receptive language delay , specific language impairment , central auditory processing disorder , fluency disorder , prior knowledge voice therapy principle previous intervention ( exception articulation speech therapy ) , inability commit least 12 week therapy determine evaluated treat speech language pathologist confirm consensus three PIs . 4 . Children whose caregiver complete primary endpoint exclude : nonEnglish speaking PVRQOL instrument administer English , unable commit 3month treatment followup schedule . 5 . Children whose caregiver willing commit 3 hour per week vocal therapy include therapy session homework 12 week . 6 . Children tolerate conscious videostroboscopic examination whose parent feel diagnostic information gain plan examination anesthesia valuable severity present symptom exclude . 7 . Children significant confounders voicerelated quality life exclude : vocal fold paralysis , neurologic disorder larynx ( dystonias , tic , tremor , etc ) , ongoing acute upper respiratory tract infection ( define least 2 follow : sneezing , cough , nasal congestion , runny nose , temperature great 100.4° F ( 38.0° C ) , untreated unsuccessfully treat allergic rhinitis/post nasal drip .</criteria>
