	<brief_summary>Hand , Foot Mouth Disease（HFMD）is infectious disease infant young child cause enterovirus . There great outbreak HFMD China , 2008 , bring panic people , also huge economic loss . Since 2008 , HFMD become one category c infectious disease China . Studies show Human Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) coxsackievirus A 16 ( CVA16 ) common reason disease . And investigator go develop vaccine disease . There urgent need know dynamic change maternal anti-EV71 ant-CVA16 level infant young child . In April 2007 , investigator start clinical trial name 'The Safety Immunogenicity Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccines Health Neonates ' ( ClinicalTrials.gov ID : NCT01183611 ) . In study investigator already build cohort Health Neonates , follow obtain blood serum day 0 , 30 , 210 360 born . So , base cohort blood serum investigator get , investigator plan study retrospectively investigate HFMD history birth follow-up another year get information incidence HFMD . The investigator also plan assay maternal anti-EV71 anti-CVA16 antibody day0 dynamic change antibody 1st month , 7th month ( day 210 ) , 1st year ( day 360 ) October , 2010 .</brief_summary>

However group picornavirus enterovirus cause HFMD , include coxsackievirus A ( CVA ) , coxsackievirus B ( CVB ) , Human Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) , Echovirus ( ECHO ) , EV71 CVA16 common reason disease . This study carry discover dynamic change maternal anti-EV71 anti-CVA16 antibody infant young child study . Infections Hand , Foot Month Disease infants young child may lead certain proportion serious case various complication death . The primary aim study find dynamic change maternal anti-EV71 antibody infant young child provide basic data future application EV71 vaccine . The second aim study find dynamic change maternal anti- CVA16 antibody level infant young child The third aim study discover risk factor Hand , Foot Month Disease estimate burden disease.Hand , Foot Mouth Disease（HFMD）is common infectious disease infant young child cause enterovirus .
