	<brief_summary>Sleep bruxism ( SB ) define `` stereotyped movement disorder characterize grind clench teeth sleep '' usually associate sleep arousal . It might lead abrasive tooth wear , hypermobility teeth , tooth hypersensitivity , hypertrophy masticatory muscle pain masticatory muscle . Diagnostic procedure include clinical evaluation , ambulatory monitoring sleep laboratory investigation others . The clinical approach comprise patient 's history , orofacial examination , tooth wear classification . There specific treatment bruxism . Management SB comprise psychological , orodental pharmacological strategies.Orodental therapy , include soft vinyl mouth guard stabilization bite splint , probably function like protector orofacial structure rather actually diminish bruxism.Drug treatment sleep bruxism controversial since different treatment strategy result suppression exacerbation condition . Based current data , central primary efferent major driver bruxism . Therefore centrally act agent antiepileptic drug also affect sleep structure , might effective SB . In case report bruxism , anxiety tremor , author suggest anti-convulsant Gabapentine may useful treatment patient antidepressant-induced bruxism . However absence definitive evidence , appropiate treatment SB still matter debate . The objective present study compare treatment efficacy occlusal stabilization splint Gabapentine SB , use polysomnographically determine outcome measure quantification sleep bruxism .</brief_summary>
