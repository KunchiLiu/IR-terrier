	<criteria>histologically cytologically confirm advanced metastatic head neck squamous cell ( HNSCC ) cancer amenable potentially curative resection . Tumor must amenable sequential biopsy , patient must willing undergo 3 sequential tumor biopsy . evidence progression firstline chemotherapy locally advanced recurrent disease . There least 4week period since last administration prior therapy initiation current study drug . Cetuximab indicate . However , prior therapy cetuximab ( particularly primary set ) allow . Presence measurable target CTscan available external review , least one diameter &gt; /= 2cm ( &gt; /= 1cm spiral CTscan use assessment followup ) . Age &gt; /= 18 year . The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % , see Appendix A ) . Life expectancy great 12 week . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/μl absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/μl platelet &gt; 100,000/μl total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x Upper limit normal ( ULN ) Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) / Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; 1.5x ULN OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine ULN . All woman childbearing potential ( WCBP ) , sexually active male patient , partner patient must agree use adequate method birth control throughout study . Women childbearing potential ( define less 1 year postmenopausal ) must negative serum urine β human chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) pregnancy test ; men woman reproductive potential must agree practice effective method avoid pregnancy receive study drug 30 day final dose study drug . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis . History allergic reaction attribute cetuximab compound similar chemical biologic composition IPI926 . Patients take rifampin , St. John 's wort , carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital exclude trial . Uncontrolled illness include , hypertension , ongoing active infection , bleed diathesis , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Baseline Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &gt; 450 msec men &gt; 470 msec woman . Concurrent treatment agent know prolong Corrected QT ( QTc ) interval Patients venous thromboembolic event ( e.g. , pulmonary embolism deep vein thrombosis ) require anticoagulation meet follow criterion exclude : Have stable dose anticoagulation &lt; 1 month Have Grade 2 , 3 4 hemorrhage past month Are experience continue symptom venous thromboembolic event Patients venous thromboembolic event meet three criterion eligible participation . History seizure within last 10 year seizure disorder require antiepileptic medication . Known HIVpositive patient . Therefore , patient take potent inhibitor inducer Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP 3A4 ) enrol study . active infection systemic use antibiotic within 72 hour treatment Cirrhotic liver disease , ongoing alcohol abuse , chronic active acute hepatitis</criteria>
