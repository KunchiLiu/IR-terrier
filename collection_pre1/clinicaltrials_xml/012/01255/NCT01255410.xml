	<detailed_description>HMPV viral respiratory pathogen discover 2001 , study show circulate human least 50 year . Older adult adult asthma infect HMPV may increase risk low respiratory illness hospitalization . In infant young child , HMPV infection may cause upper low respiratory illness , ear infection , bronchiolitis , croup , pneumonia , exacerbation asthma . Children le 2 year age susceptible severe HMPV infection , HMPV second third lead cause viral low respiratory illness child . The National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) work develop live-attenuated , intranasally administer HMPV vaccine use infant . The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity HMPV vaccine . The vaccine evaluate four group participant : healthy adult ; HMPV-seropositive child ; two group HMPV-seronegative infant child , seronegative group receive different dose vaccine . In adult group , participant receive vaccine ; infant child group , participant randomly assign receive either vaccine placebo . Study researcher review participant ' study data confirm safety vaccine enrol next group participant . This study first enroll healthy adult . At baseline study visit , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , nasal wash procedure , vital sign measurement , blood collection . They receive vaccine , remain clinic 30 minute observation . Participants record temperature daily 12 day . Additional study visit occur Days 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 12 . At study visit , participant undergo medical history review , vital sign measurement , nasal wash procedure . A final study visit occur Day 28 also include blood collection . The second group participant include seropositive child . They receive vaccine placebo vaccine take part study procedure adult participant . Participants ' parent receive telephone call e-mail study staff Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 13 obtain record medical history temperature reading . The third fourth group participant include seronegative infant child . Each two group receive different dos vaccine placebo vaccine . They attend study visit Days 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 28 , 56 , undergo study procedures participant . Parents seronegative infant child receive telephone call e-mail study staff Days 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 27 , 29 .
