	<brief_title>Comparative Study 1000 Centistoke Versus 5000 Centistoke Silicone Oil Repair Complex Retinal Detachments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part retinal detachment surgery , eye typically fill gas bubble silicone oil bubble . This bubble act like balloon inside eye help keep retina push back eye wall heal proper place . Gas bubble spontaneously dissolve week whereas silicone oil remain eye remove another surgery . When retinal detachment associate significant scar tissue retinal surface , silicone oil often use since remain fill eyeball long necessary help retina heal properly place . Currently , two different type silicone oil ( 1000 centistoke 5000 centistoke ) commercially available approve use eye Food Drug Administration . The goal study compare outcome use two different type silicone oil . The retinal detachment repair standard fashion . There difference way retinal detachment repair study compare study . Patients randomly assign ( like flip coin ) receive one type silicone oil . Both type oil similar characteristic . The primary difference one type thicker ( viscous ) , analogous honey comparison maple syrup .</detailed_description>
