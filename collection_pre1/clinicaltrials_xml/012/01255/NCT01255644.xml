	<brief_summary>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) increasingly believe closely related chronic stimulation healthy B-cells . Identification antigen ( ) relevant stimulation CLL precursor cell therefore high interest . The investigator find recently evidence herpes virus involved process stimulation . Consequently , elimination antigenic stimulation leukemic cell herpes virus may expect reduce even inhibit propagation leukemic cell . The investigator hypothesize inhibition CMV replication short course antiviral treatment may reduce significantly proliferation rate leukemic cell . To test hypothesis , investigator treat 20 CLL patient antiviral drug 3 month proof-of-concept clinical trial leukemic cell count measure antiviral treatment . Antiviral treatment potential treat disease origin therefore efficiently conventional chemotherapeutic regimen .</brief_summary>
