	<detailed_description>This study conduct use traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation study design . Enrollment least 3 subject plan dose cohort Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) determine . Up three additional subject per cohort may enrol additional subject know positive Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase ( ALK ) Proto-Oncogene Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ROS ( ROS ) abnormality . The decision expand cohort dose escalate base occurrence dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) Cycle 1 consider Investigator related ( possibly probably ) ASP3026 . Intra-subject dose escalation allow discretion investigator . The Safety Data Review Committee may elect enroll additional subject cohort evaluate dose level . Once MTD determine , approximately 20 additional subject Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase ( ALK ) abnormalities enrol Recommended Phase 2 Dose . Each cycle include 28 day continuous dose ASP3026 . Treatment ASP3026 may continue one discontinuation criterion meet .</detailed_description>
