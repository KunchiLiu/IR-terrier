	<brief_title>Different Safety Profile Risperidone Paliperidone Extended-release</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new oral antipsychotic drug , paliperidone extended-release ( ER ) , recently develop might represent innovative approach treatment schizophrenia . Paliperidone 9-hydroxyrisperidone , chief active metabolite risperidone . Although paliperidone possess pharmacological profile similar parent compound , many different pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic characteristic compare risperidone ( Pani Marchese , 2009 ) . First , paliperidone ER utilize osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system ( OROS ) , result stable serum concentration reduce likelihood causing unexpected over- under-dosages due CYP2D6 genetic variability . Second , paliperidone undergo significant hepatic metabolism , drug predominantly excrete kidney unchanged drug ; whereas risperidone extensively metabolize CYP2D6 hepatic enzyme . Third , off-rate dissociation human clone D2 receptor tissue culture cell faster paliperidone ( 60 ) compare risperidone ( 27 min ) ( Seeman , 2005 ) . Due looser bind D2 receptor , paliperidone associate reduce risk extrapyramidal side effect compare parent drug . Fourth , ex vivo study indicate paliperidone injection induce relatively small H1 occupancy level brain animal compare similar dosage risperidone ( Schotte , et al . 1995 1996 ) . This may contribute reduce sedative effect less weight gain secondary paliperidone compare risperidone . Finally , paliperidone relevant affinity toward muscarinic receptor , result absence anticholinergic side effect ; another important benefit compare risperidone ( Schotte , et al . 1996 ) . Therefore , paliperidone would drug choice young psychotic patient preservation improvement cognitive function critical . All property might associate improved efficacy well tolerability paliperidone ER compare risperidone . In support view , recent study ( Canuso , et al . 2008 2010 ) demonstrate switch risperidone paliperidone ER result improvement medication satisfaction , Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) ( Kay , et al . 1987 ) score , abbreviate Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale ( Chouinard Margolese , 2005 ) score . However , date , clinical trial investigate relative superiority paliperidone ER risperidone term effect cognitive function . Recently , interest negative subjective experience secondary antipsychotic medication renew , experience key factor adherence clinical outcome ( Awad , 1993 ; van Putten May , 1978 ) . Artaloytia et al . ( 2006 ) report risperidone induce negative symptom healthy volunteer , might term secondary negative symptom . Therefore , hypothesize paliperidone ER good safety profile term subjective experience cognitive function compare risperidone . Research effect antipsychotic drug subjective experience cognitive function patient schizophrenia may hamper numerous confound factor , pathological feature illness , patient motivation , concomitant medication . Investigating effect antipsychotic drug healthy subject provide method control variable . Therefore , main objective study assess subjective experience related secondary negative symptom cognitive performance healthy volunteer response multiple dose paliperidone ER risperidone double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . Adverse event cause drug also evaluate .</detailed_description>
