This trial intend short-term assessment efficacy Uresta device , use placebo arm order remove possible source patient bias . The placebo ( `` sham '' ) group obtain place flexible silastic ring ( inactivated Estring ) high vagina alter urethral force . The aim unequivocally determine whether Uresta device provide necessary urethral support stop urine leakage stress incontinence . The hypothesis Uresta device significantly reduce urinary loss baseline , show significant reduction pad weight follow pad test device place .</brief_summary>
