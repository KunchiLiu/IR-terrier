	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis/septic shock serious condition associate high mortality rate . The pathophysiology disease involve complex interaction host 's immunity microorganism toxin . The release immune complex cascade inflammatory cytokine responsible multiorgan dysfunction , especially cardiovascular system . Hydrocortisone recommend useful treatment decrease mortality hemodynamically unstable septic shock patient , response fluid moderate dose vasopressor . Both anti-inflammation supplementation relatively adrenal insufficiency main hypothesis benefit hydrocortisone . During progression severe sepsis/septic shock , multi-organ dysfunction develop . Acute lung injury ( ALI ) severe form , acute respiratory syndrome ( ARDS ) one common organ dysfunction associate septic shock . Although controversy time favorable patients'characteristic , information meta-analysis suggest moderate dose hydrocortisone may improve ARDS patient ' outcome .
