	<brief_title>Self-Reported Versus Objective Measured Compliance With Oral Appliance Therapy Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Oral appliance , Mandibular Repositioning Appliances ( MRA ) , emerge conservative treatment option sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) . Up date , objective method available measure compliance oral appliance treatment SDB . As CPAP early year , sleep apnea community nowadays strong interest objective measurement oral appliance use adherence . Subjective measure self-report commonly result overestimation compliance . Methods We perform 12-week clinical trial compare active/objective measurement compliance subjective self-reported usage . We enroll 50 patient establish diagnosis SDB receive treatment titratable , duobloc MRA ( RespiDent Butterfly® MRA , RespiDent , Nijlen , Belgium ) . Active microsensors ( TheraMon® , Handelsagentur Gschladt , Hargelsberg , Oostenrijk ) provide Handelsagentr Gschladt ( Hargelsberg , Oostenrijk ) without cost . The sample interval record do rate 1 measurement per 15 minute ( every 900 second ) . Using sample interval , capacity active microsensor allow data acquisition 100 day period . The microsensors intercalate MRA device dental technician . Participants receive explanation purpose study , fact investigator want study temperature fluctuation night oral cavity . As result , subject unaware MRA use compliance measure . A first follow-up appointment schedule first 4 week . A second final follow-up visit schedule 12 week start study . During follow-up visit patient ask fill questionnaire contain question MRA wear last 4 8 week ( mean hours/night , mean nights/week ) , respectively . The objective measurement MRA wear time ( total hour wear time mean hour wear per night respective period ) base assumption MRA wear chip record temperature intraorally . This study design provide 12-week evaluation patient ( n=50 ) . Perspective Hypothesis The removable nature oral appliance warrant objective assessment effective use compliance overnight MRA treatment SDB . We hypothesize objective compliance might turn significantly low compare subjectively report compliance .</detailed_description>
