	<brief_summary>While clinical phlebotomy current standard practice alleviate non-transfusion iron overload patient PCT , may suitable patient . For example , patient unwilling adequately phlebotomized inconvenience , phlebotomy cumbersome , especially induction treatment phase require frequent clinic visit ( twice month , least 6 month ) venous access difficulty . Other patient unable undergo phlebotomy due medical reason anemia cardiopulmonary disorder . It postulate patient PCT non-transfusion iron overload could benefit treatment deferasirox ( Exjade® ) , daily oral iron chelator license several country , include EU , treat transfusion iron overload adult pediatric patient . Although data efficacy safety deferasirox patient HH , , like PCT , non-transfusional iron overload , need evaluate safety efficacy deferasirox treatment non-transfusion iron overload patient PCT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Oral Deferasirox Patients With Porphyria Cutanea Tarda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective ass safety deferasirox treat non-transfusion iron overload patient PCT . The secondary objective ass effectiveness deferasirox treatment : After 3 6 month : •Lower serum ferritin abnormal normal standard range specify male female patient population . After 6 month : •Lower liver iron content 24 week treatment measure liver MRI T2 After 3 6 month : - Improve clinical symptom , i.e . improvement skin lesion ( reduction new bulla formation ) , skin fragility ( photograph use ) . - Reduce porphyrin level .</detailed_description>
