	<brief_summary>Superficial siderosis progressive neurological disease cause iron deposition central nervous system chronic subarachnoid bleeding . Until 2011 , effective treatment progressive condition lead hearing loss , spasticity , weakness , loss bowel/bladder function , incoordination , dementia ultimately death . Last year , demonstrate lipid soluble iron chelator , deferiprone , reduce hemosiderin deposition patient superficial siderosis MRI little 3 month . As therapy improve condition , chelation deferiprone standard care treatment superficial siderosis . Now FDA approve deferiprone United States thalassemia , propose document clinical effect deferiprone 2 year superficial siderosis patient . Our goal understand clinical course disease alter use standard care chelation therapy deferiprone . Patients superficial siderosis take deferiprone chelation therapy dose consistent standard care offer enrollment observational study . Patients treat monitored locally participate neurologist agree help u collect information study . We interested document clinical effect deferiprone hearing , ataxia myelopathy use standardized scale perform document effect deferiprone hemosiderin deposition CNS MRI , perform accord standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>First describe 100 year ago , superficial siderosis rare neurodegenerative disease cause iron toxicity CNS due chronic subarachnoid bleeding . Iron red blood cell subarachnoid space preferentially take Bergmann glia cerebellum , brainstem , spinal cord , eighth cranial nerve cerebral cortex ; iron store ferritin within glial cell . With continued subarachnoid bleeding , glia overwhelm ferritin load die . Their loss expose neuron free iron toxic cell catalyze breakdown hydrogen peroxide superoxide , reactive oxygen specie cause lipid peroxidation , membrane dysfunction , neuronal cell death . Neurological consequence iron overload depend area brain expose free iron . With chronic subarachnoid bleeding , blood tends pool around brainstem , cerebellum spinal cord thus lead classic triad hearing loss , ataxia myelopathy see 50 % patient superficial siderosis . The eighth cranial nerve course subarachnoid space reach inner ear expose toxic blood ; contrast , cranial nerve protect peripheral Schwann cell within 1 mm exit brainstem . Compared CNS structure affect superficial siderosis , eighth cranial nerve susceptible expose surface area volume . Thus , common often first symptom patient get sensorineural hearing loss . This follow ataxia due dysfunction vestibular component eighth cranial nerve neurodegeneration cerebellum . Myelopathy develop brainstem spinal cord involve . With continued bleeding , area brain degenerate lead myriad symptom see superficial siderosis include urinary problem headache , anosmia , diplopia , bowel problem , ageusia , cranial nerve palsy , dementia . The etiology chronic subarachnoid bleeding ( order incidence ) : Idiopathic , Head/back trauma , A/V malformation , Current CNS tumor , Previously resect CNS tumor , CNS post-surgical ( non-tumor ) , Amyloid angiopathy , Brachial plexus/root injury . Currently , few 50 patient world-wide diagnosis superficial siderosis . In United States , estimate 50-60 patient . Iron chelators , deferiprone , use iron-overload disorder hemochromatosis expect effective superficial siderosis cross blood brain barrier . Copper chelators use Wilson 's disease permeate brain-blood barrier , unfortunately effective superficial siderosis , bind iron . Surgical intervention think key slow disease stanch leak blood subarachnoid space . However , neurodegenerative process begin , surgical intervention prevent neurodegenerative disease progressing . Recently , demonstrate deferiprone , lipid-soluble iron chelator , dose 30 mg/kg/day administer 90 day safe population 10 superficial siderosis patient . Although design ass efficacy , also find 4 10 patient show reduced hemosiderin deposition CNS trial , different natural course disease hemosiderin deposition either remain 3 month increases time . This suggest deferiprone may effective chelate hemosiderin patient superficial siderosis .</detailed_description>
