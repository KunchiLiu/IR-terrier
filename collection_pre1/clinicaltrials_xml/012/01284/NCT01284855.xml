Each participant initially receive either 2 vial 10 vial snake polyvalent antivenom . Mortality , proportion patient need assisted respiration , percentage patient show worsen neurotoxic sign therefore require additional dos antivenom compare arm . The kinetics recovery total consumption antivenom also compare . Finally , incidence severity early late adverse reaction antivenom assess .
