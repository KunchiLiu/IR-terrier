	<brief_title>Effect Celecoxib Perioperative Inflammatory Response Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study first assess perioperative time course systemic inflammation immunity colon cancer patient evaluate effect anti-inflammatory treatment celecoxib response . In addition , evaluation effect short-term preoperative administration celecoxib tumor immunogenicity help u understand tumor-enhancing inflammation anti-tumor immunity differentially affect COX-2 inhibitor . The knowledge gain result research help u set infrastructure method monitor immunoinflammatory status colon cancer patient long term goal design intervention suppress tumor-enhancing inflammation vitalize anti-tumor immunity perioperative period . The long-term objective use novel tool order improve cancer-specific survival patient colon cancer primary tumor resection .</detailed_description>
