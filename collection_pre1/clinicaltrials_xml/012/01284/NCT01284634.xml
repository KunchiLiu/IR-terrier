	<brief_title>Study Assess Effect Cannabidiol Liver Fat Levels Subjects With Fatty Liver Disease .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 10 week ( 2-10 day screening , eight week treatment period one week follow-up ) , randomize , partially-blind study assess effect CBD subject raise liver triglyceride ( liver fat â‰¥ 5 % ) . Eligible subject enter study Screening Visit ( Visit 1 , Day -10 -2 ) commence two ten day screen period , return baseline visit ( Visit 2 , Day 1 ) . During fasted Screening Visit , study-related observation include : informed consent , demographic , medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , vital sign , weight , height concomitant medication . Subjects follow assessment perform : 1 . Fasting lipid profile blood sample 2 . Fasting plasma glucose , HbA1c &amp; fast serum insulin 3 . Safety blood test ( haematology biochemistry ) 4 . Urinalysis ( include drug abuse screen ) 5 . CAGE Questionnaire ass alcohol dependency 6 . Body weight measure BMI calculate 7 . Pregnancy test ( appropriate ) 8 . Liver triglyceride content ( Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) ) scan unless documented history liver fat content equal 5 % measure Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) /MRS biopsy within last two month prior screen visit . Where subject ( and/or carers ) feel scan pose significant burden ( addition visit procedure ) , fast scan may undertake separately remain visit procedure complete within 72 hour visit . Suitable subject invite return fast Baseline Visit ( Visit 2 , Day 1 ) . The following measurement make Visit 2 , prior study medication dispense : 1 ) Safety assessment ( Adverse Event ( ) ( AE ) ) vital sign review concomitant medication ) 2 ) Body weight measurement / adipose tissue distribution . Body fat content visceral adiposity assess MRI/MRS . Where subject ( and/or carers ) feel scan pose significant burden ( addition visit procedure ) , fast scan may undertake separately remain visit procedure complete within 72 hour visit . 3 ) Fasting lipid blood sample 4 ) Fasting plasma glucose serum insulin 5 ) Safety blood sample ( haematology biochemistry ) 6 ) Urinalysis 7 ) Liver triglyceride content ( MRI/MRS scan ) . Where subject ( and/or carers ) feel scan pose significant burden ( addition visit procedure ) , fast scan may undertake separately remain visit procedure complete within 72 hour visit . 8 ) Other assessment ( blood sample plasma CBD level ; Physical Activity Questionnaire ; Food Frequency Questionnaire ) Subjects issue study medication advise take twice daily instruct . There safety follow-up telephone call Week 1 , Day 8 ( Visit 3 ) involve review new ongoing AEs change concomitant medication . Compliance IMP administration also discuss . There second safety follow-up telephone call Week 2 , Day 15 ( Visit 4 ) , involve review new ongoing AEs change concomitant medication . Compliance IMP administration also discuss . A visit take place mid-treatment ( Visit 5 , Week 4 , Day 29 ) follow assessment perform : 1 . Safety assessment ( AEs , vital sign , review concomitant medication physical exam ) 2 . Safety blood sample ( haematology , biochemistry non-fasting glucose ) 3 . Urinalysis 4 . IMP compliance review There safety follow-up telephone call Week 6 , Day 43 ( Visit 6 ) involve review new ongoing AEs change concomitant medication . Compliance IMP administration also discuss . A fasted visit take place end treatment ( Visit 7 , Day 57 ) follow assessment perform : 1 . Safety assessment ( AEs , vital sign , review concomitant medication , physical exam ( include body weight measurement BMI calculation ) , ECG pregnancy test appropriate ) 2 . Body weight measurement / adipose tissue distribution 3 . Fasting lipid blood sample 4 . Fasting plasma glucose serum insulin 5 . Safety blood sample ( haematology biochemistry ) 6 . Urinalysis ( include drug abuse screen ) 7 . Liver triglyceride content ( MRI/MRS scan ) . Where subject ( and/or carers ) feel scan pose significant burden ( addition visit procedure ) , fast scan may undertake separately remain visit procedure complete within 72 hour visit . 8 . Other assessment ( blood sample plasma CBD level ; Physical Activity Questionnaire ; Food Frequency Questionnaire ) 9 . IMP compliance review There final safety follow-up telephone call Visit 8 ( seven day completion withdrawal ) , involve review new ongoing AEs change concomitant medication .</detailed_description>
