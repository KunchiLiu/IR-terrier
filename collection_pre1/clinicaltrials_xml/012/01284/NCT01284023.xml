	<brief_summary>Acute compartment syndrome ( ACS ) complication lower leg trauma occur pressure inside leg due swell exceed body 's ability provide blood muscle leg . This condition cut blood flow leg . Left untreated , condition result devastate consequence include complete loss function low extremity amputation . Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) -based tissue perfusion monitor non-invasive mean continuously monitoring amount oxygen tissue injure extremity . The device utilize harmless red light detect proportion hemoglobin saturate oxygen 3 cm skin surface . The purpose study launch first stag validation device diagnostic tool compartment syndrome , observe device uninjured subject .</brief_summary>
