	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether feature plaque coronary artery predispose heart muscle injury angioplasty patient narrow least one artery may need stent place heart catheterization . Participants undergo cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study heart catheterization look scar heart muscle . During heart catheterization , participant undergo intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) exam look make-up plaque stent placement investigator measure pressure artery look severe blockage . Within 30 day heart catheterization , participant second MRI do look new scar heart muscle .</brief_summary>
