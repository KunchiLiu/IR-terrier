	<brief_title>Mycophenolic Acid ( MPA ) Monotherapy Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis test donor-microchimerism specific cell population promote development donor-specific regulation turn allow long-term maintenance therapy single drug ( Myfortic ) select patient lead superior long-term outcome . Subjects enrol post-transplantation liver transplant recipient meet eligibility exclusion criterion . We use post-transplant monitoring donor-specific immunologic regulation ( DSR+/ DSA negative ) direct withdrawal patient Myfortic monotherapy . Donor microchimerism , DSR , DSA development perform sample obtain every six month patient study . The ultimate objective study use immunologic monitoring develop rational approach achieve individualized immunosuppression liver transplant patient .</detailed_description>
