	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two different type image technique identify endoleaks . Following endovascular procedure , subject see one month compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) confirm graft leaking ( endoleak ) . CTA standard imaging technique use identify endoleaks . This study investigate image technique color duplex ultrasound contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEUS ) good tool identify endoleaks .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound vs. Computed Tomographic Angiography Detection Endoleaks Following AAA Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAAs ) continue lead cause death old age group . In 60-85 year-old population , AAA represent 14th-leading cause death . Federal funding Medicare allocate early detection use abdominal ultrasound screen program . Despite aggressive screening program concert effort surgeon timely repair , incidence rupture AAA continue increase . Endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) common type repair since 2006 . Multiple study reflect decrease perioperative morbidity mortality open repair make attractive option patient . EVAR require intensive follow-up standard open surgical repair , however . Secondary intervention common maintain `` seal '' endograft within aorta subsequent exclusion aneurysmal component . The term endoleak specific EVAR , describe primary mean endografts fail . Type I endoleaks occur inadequate graft seal proximally distally , result perigraft flow aneurysm sac pressurization . Type II endoleaks occur branch artery arise aneurysmal aorta back-bleed aneurysm sac due collateral flow . Type III endoleaks occur flow persists segment modular graft . Type IV endoleaks occur flow persists endograft material ( graft porosity ) . Type V endoleaks also call `` endotension '' , occur pressurization sac occur absence demonstrable endoleak . Type I Type III endoleaks concern rupture , although persistent Type II endoleaks also lead aneurysm rupture premature death . The common method EVAR follow-up compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) . These study allow accurate measurement aneurysm sac diameter volume . They also highly sensitive specific endoleaks . Type II endoleaks treat remain persistent present set aneurysm sac enlargement . Type I III endoleaks immediately treat identify . Type IV endoleaks rarely see current endograft technology . Study Objectives : The purpose current study compare routine postoperative surveillance CTA color duplex ultrasound contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEUS ) detection endoleaks . Study Design This pilot study compare image technique CTA CEUS 25 patient undergoing EVAR one month post endograft surveillance . The one month standard follow-up use compare technique yield high number endoleak positive patient . Patients complete color duplex examination conjunction CEUS use FDA approve ultrasound contrast agent OptisonTM ( Perflutren Protein Type A Microspheres Injection , USP ) . Following ultrasonographic evaluation , study patient undergo routine CTA . Eligible subject ask participate trial follow post-op day number 1 endovascular procedure . Study participation ~30 day ( + 7 day ) .</detailed_description>
