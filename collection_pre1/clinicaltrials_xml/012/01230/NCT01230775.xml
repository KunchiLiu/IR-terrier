	<brief_summary>This multicenter , phase III , randomize , subject sponsor-blinded , placebo-controlled study determine treatment effect `` Anagrelide retard '' subject Essential Thrombocythaemia ( ET ) `` define risk '' ( definition risk criterion : see Inclusion Criteria Section 5.1 ) The study plan 2-stage procedure accord Bauer Köhne : After recruitment 140 subject interim analysis re-assessment sample size plan adaptive manner . As confirmatory analysis base time-to-event evaluation ( i.e . time 1st clinically significant ET related event ) , stipulate observation time identically apply subject . Yet , interim analysis perform recruited 140 subject - expect reach 1 year - estimate observation time subject stage I also 1 year . ( Details explain section `` Statistical Considerations '' ) . Subjects randomized 1:1 ratio one follow two arm : Group A : Anagrelide retard Group B : Placebo An priori stratification plan JAK-2 mutational status . For exploratory purpose post hoc stratification use obtain covariate adjust result , follow potentially predictive factor : sex , age , Factor V Leiden , BMI . Dosing start 1 tablet per day week 1 titrate accord response ( platelet reduction ) 2 tablet week 2 . Dosing may increase decreased accord platelet response week 3 4 . However , maximum dose 4 tablet ( =8mg ) per day . After week 4 , maximum dose achieve optimal platelet count ( &lt; 450 G/L ) maintain ( visit schedule see study flow chart section IV ) . To verify treatment response , platelet count must evaluate every visit . The platelet count value withhold subject duration stage I stage II respectively . The subject agree explicitly procedure signing Informed Consent form . This patient sponsor-blinded clinical study . The trial medical package blind fashion keep patient unaware ( blind ) towards actual treatment group randomize . The sponsor function ( include medical monitor , pharmacovigilance manager , clinical project manager , trial data manager trial statistician ) stay blind course study database lock . Randomization scheme prepare independent statistician ( otherwise involve study ) , store securely access sponsor function mention . The process randomization ( provision individual drug-allocation information subject ) carry trained staff Harrison , adherence procedure keep blind function unaware information ( blind ) . Unblinding envelope , contain treatment code per patient number identification treatment case safety-relevant unblinding need , store sponsor 's site . At end study , verification extent maintain blind check envelope break , take place properly document . If seal envelope broken provide treatment identification , date breaking code , initial person break code reason state envelope . The operational detail blind procedure outline relevant work guideline ( ARETA Study Working Guideline idv staff ARETA Study Working Guideline Harrison , current version ) . Investigator blind study , i.e . case medical need individual patient management drive full knowledge trial related intervention . For case , sponsor need unblind patient ( e.g . due safety reason ) , mention ( section ) envelop use . Only treatment naïve subject , respect cytoreductive drug confirm diagnosis ET ( centralize re-evaluation accord WHO , 2008 ; see Section 6.2.1 ) assessment JAK-2 status ( centralize re-evaluation JAK-2 status ; see Section 6.2.2 ) enrol . As described , stage I study consider close soon 140 subject recruit . The duration stage II depend result re-assessment sample size . Once stage I finish , stage I subject enter extension period maximum three year .</brief_summary>
