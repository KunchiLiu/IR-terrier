	<brief_summary>This study compare effect high fat overfeed metabolic risk factor child bear though assisted reproduction technology ( ART ) versus child conceive naturally ( control ) . The investigator utilize state ART measure characterize physiological , endocrine molecular response high fat overfeeding . The investigator hypothesize child conceive follow ART great response high fat dietary challenge associate DNA hypermethylation gene involve lipid metabolism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study represent novel initiative investigator determine whether child conceive ART different metabolic response baseline response high fat overfeed compare age body mass index-matched spontaneously conceive control . Furthermore , investigator identify difference DNA methylation candidate gene involve lipid metabolism adipose tissue blood , determine whether related adverse outcomes high fat overfeed . The result study help answer grow question future health In vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) baby , may stimulate research optimise protocol ovarian stimulation in-vitro condition early blastocyst development .</detailed_description>
