	<brief_summary>This pilot study drug call rituximab use together drugs—prednisone , etoposide , ifosfamide . Prednisone , etoposide , ifosfamide use part standard chemotherapy relapse Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL ) . Rituximab approve Food Drug Administration 1997 . However , use rituximab prednisone , etoposide , ifosfamide pediatric patient relapse refractory ALL consider experimental . This study patient ALL second great relapse , first relapse respond treatment . The goal study : - To see use rituximab prednisone , etoposide , ifosfamide beneficial leukemia treatment - To find side effect combination drug cause A total 15 participant ( 30 year old young ) enrol , period 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale study design : The combination etoposide ifosfamide reinduction regimen use many previous study pediatric B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . It use anthracyclines , therefore safely used patient risk cardiac toxicity due previous anthracycline use . Previous study adult patient ALL demonstrate safety efficacy addition rituximab induction regimen . Rituximab anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody . Approximately one-half pediatric case B precursor ALL express CD20 antigen leukemic blast . The use rituximab provide potential target CD20 positive cell , therefore improve rate cytotoxicity associate chemotherapy . Rituximab previously utilize many pediatric adult regimen combination chemotherapeutic agent , expect safe combination etoposide ifosfamide . However , since never study combination chemotherapy , strict stopping rule place ensure safe combination . A recent study demonstrate upregulation CD20 expression leukemic blast expose one week prednisone therapy . This increase expression occur majority B-ALL patient sample , regardless whether patient initially express CD20 surface leukemic blast . In sample upregulation CD20 treat rituximab , cytotoxicity rituximab successful sample small percentage CD20 expression . Therefore , prednisone give two week combination etoposide ifosfamide . It hop percentage leukemic blast express CD20 increase combination medication , allow rituximab effective give weekly start day 8 therapy . To good understand process , sample blood bone marrow collect quantify CD20 expression amount leukemia present multiple time point month study duration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age : Patients must 130 year age initial diagnosis . 2 . Diagnosis : Patients must histologicallyconfirmed relapsed/refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL ) . 3 . Disease Status : Patients must second great bone marrow relapse ( ≥ 25 % blast morphology ) , refractory reinduction therapy one attempt remission reinduction ( end reinduction blast ≥ 5 % morphology and/or end reinduction MRD ≥ 1 % flow cytometry ) . Patients combine bone marrow extramedullary relapse eligible ( CNS 3 patient exclude ) . 4 . Performance Status : Patients must performance status ≥50 Lansky Scale &lt; 10 year ≥ 50 Karnofsky Scale ≥ 10 year . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . 5 . Prior Therapy : Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study meet time restriction end prior therapy state : Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : must receive within 2 week entry onto study ( 4 week case nitrosurea contain therapy ) . Patients relapse receive ALL maintenance chemotherapy require waiting period entry onto study . Cytoreduction hydroxyurea initiate continue 24 hour prior start therapy . XRT : must ≥ 4 week since completion radiation therapy . Study specific limitation : must ≥ 7 day since completion corticosteroid therapy . Growth factor ( ) : Must receive hematopoietic growth factor ( GCSF , Neulasta , GMCSF ) within 7 day study entry . Stem Cell Transplant : Patients must least two month stem cell transplant , must immunosuppressives , must evidence active graft versus host disease . Biologic ( antineoplastic agent ) : At least 7 day since completion therapy biologic agent . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . The duration interval must discuss study chair . 6 . Institutional review board approval . 7 . Individual inform consent per local guideline federal state regulation . 8 . Organ Function : All patient must adequate organ function define : Renal Function : Patients must calculate creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR ≥ 70mL/min/1.73m2 normal serum creatinine base age/gender . Liver Function : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) age , AND SGPT ( ALT ) ≤ 5 x institutional ULN age Cardiac Function : Ejection fraction &gt; 50 % echocardiogram MUGA Scan , OR Shortening fraction ≥ 27 % echocardiogram MUGA Scan Reproductive Function : Due potential teratogenic effect drug , postmenarchal female patient must negative serum beta HCG prior study enrollment . In addition , patient childbearing childfathering potential must agree medically acceptable form contraception , include abstinence , study . 1 . Patients active uncontrolled infection , define need pressor , and/or positive culture 24 hour . 2 . Patients recover allogeneic bone marrow transplantation still immunosupressants . 3 . Pregnant lactating female . Women childbearing age agree use contraception protocol . 4 . Patients currently receive investigational agent , medication , supplement know antileukemic effect . 5 . Patients , opinion investigator , able comply safety monitoring requirement study . 6 . Patients reactivation hepatitis B prior start therapy . 7 . Patients HIV positive . 8 . Patients must CNS 3 involvement .</criteria>
