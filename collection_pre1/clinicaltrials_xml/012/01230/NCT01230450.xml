	<brief_title>Feasibility Comparing Two Surgical Treatment Female Urodynamic Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single incision tension-free sub-urethral vaginal tape procedures8 recently describe attempt avoid blind passage trochars groin &amp; adductor muscle consequently reduce incidence &amp; severity postoperative leg pain . The obvious advantage would shorter hospital stay , early recovery , early resumption day day activity &amp; early return work . A number small prospective audit case-series present international conference report safety &amp; outcomes procedure . However study preliminary report proof concept therefore study population 15-70 woman short term follow-up 2-3 month9-11.These study show low perioperative complication rate : bladder injury 0-1 % , vaginal erosion 1-3 % &amp; one study show 1.3 % pain 6 week follow-up . The patient report success rate 77-93 % 2-3 month follow-up9-12 . Objectives : 1 . Establish feasibility `` Single incision sub-urethral tape '' do local anaesthesia . 2 . The feasibility randomisation standard surgical treatment TVT-O / TVT . 3 . To compare surgical approach relatively new procedure standard procedures regard : Peri-operative complication rate , Postoperative pain , Time discharge hospital , 4 . To compare outcomes regard : Patient-reported cure rate , Patient satisfaction , Impact Quality life ( QoL ) sexual function 3 month &amp; 1 -year follow-up . The objective cure rate assess 3 month follow-up . Design : A pilot prospective randomise study within participate urogynaecology unit `` Scottish Pelvic Floor Network '' .</detailed_description>
