	<detailed_description>Occlusive disease femoro-popliteal artery associate symptom range pain calf exertion pain rest ultimately ulceration gangrene . Treatment option include ) conservative measure , attention medical risk factor , smoke cessation exercise programme , b ) minimally invasive treatment angioplasty c ) surgical procedure femoro-popliteal bypass graft . Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) widely use treatment femoro-popliteal stenosis occlusion many year . However , medium long-term result always suboptimal due high rate restenosis . With restenosis rate 70 % PTA alone long SFA lesion . Factors contribute poor result include presence occlusion rather stenosis , length lesion severity run-off vessel disease . ( 1 ) Stents expandable metal mesh tube widely use treatment arterial disease coronary , renal iliac artery , show superior patency balloon angioplasty alone . In treatment SFA lesions several early study investigate patency balloon expandable stent . These stent low flexibility high risk deformation SFA . Medium long-term result well PTA alone . ( 2 ) Self expand nitinol stent stent generally high flexibility moderate high radial force . Initial study show promising result SFA . ( 3 ) Early prospective randomise study , Sirocco I II study show low 7 % restenosis rate 6 month 18 % 12 month self expand nitinol stent . ( 4 , 5 ) Later study focus issue correlation stent fracture low patency . These show high restenosis rate correlate length stented segment , number stent stent brand ( 6 ) Up frequent use stent SFA `` bailout '' stenting . Investigated prospective randomise trial patient severe claudication critical ischemia long lesion ( 130 +- 60 mm ) primary stenting SFA show superior result PTA bailout stenting restenosis rate , ABI walk distance . ( 7 ) There moment two trial investigate result direct stenting . The FAST trial investigate claudicants short lesion ( 4,5 cm ) ; stent arm use Luminexx stent versus PTA alone significant difference patency treatment arm 12 month follow . ( 8 ) The Resilient trial investigate patient claudication critical limb ischemia 6,5 cm long lesion . The result publish , positive `` pre hand '' information already come . ( 9 ) The accepted treatment claudicants conservative best medical treatment without supervised walk training . ( 10 ) There trend stent treatment certain situation . There best knowledge study compare direct stenting conservative treatment claudicants . The aim study evaluate whether primary stenting nitinol self expand stent patient suffer stable claudication ( Fontaine IIa IIb ) due superficial femoral artery disease , result improve patient outcome , compare conservative treatment alone measure improvement Quality Life score 12 month treatment use SF-36 EuroQol EQ-5D survey . Patients follow 24 month treatment . A secondary objective study impact primary stenting versus conservative treatment ABI Walking Distance development 24 month follow period . In addition , cost-parameters collect arm allow basic cost-effectiveness comparison 24 month . 12 month follow-up data accept publication Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg 2017 .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; 18 year 2 . Female patient child bear potential may pregnant study entry must utilize reliable birth control duration participation study . 3 . Patient suffer stable claudication ( Fontaine IIa IIb ) . 4 . One denovo restenotic superficial femoral artery target treatment area extend beyond approximately 3 cm patella MRA . 5 . Patent popliteal artery index side , runoff vessel situation level six well accord Rutherford classification prior day procedure . Target vessel diameter ≥ 4 mm MRA . 6 . Patient willing able comply specify followup evaluation 7 . The patient legally authorize representative must provide write informed consent prior procedure . 1 . Recent hemorrhagic stroke ( within past 3 month ) 2 . Aneurysm SFA popliteal artery 3 . Previously implant stent ( ) treat artery site 4 . Poor aortoiliac common femoral `` inflow '' , would deem inadequate support femoropopliteal bypass graft . However , intervention restore adequate blood flow least three month prior index procedure allow 5 . Significant vessel tortuosity parameter prohibit access lesion 90° tortuosity would prevent delivery stent device 6 . Revascularisation involve limb 30 day prior index procedure plan revascularisation within 30 day index procedure 8.Critical Limb Ischemia index leg ( Fontaine III IV ) . 9.Requirement stent placement popliteal artery . For purpose protocol lesion locate least three centimetre proximal superior edge patella . 10.Life expectancy less 24 month factor make clinical followup difficult 11.Patients enrol clinical trial anticipate included trial , without write approval principal investigator study . 12.Walking capacity 500 meter .</criteria>
