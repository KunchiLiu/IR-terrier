	<brief_summary>To evaluate efficacy honey post surgical exit site care process promote heal prevent infectious bacterial colonization newly create exit site . It show medical literature honey property conducive heal prevention infection . In one study demonstrate urethral injury rat treat honey injury heal none usual formation fibrous tissue see heal process , reduction luminal diameter usually see , cell line urethra uncompromised way , i.e . totally normal healthy . We feel exit site heal quickly good normal tissue develop patient much good chance keep exit healthy reducing time , cost , disruption lifestyle . Other positive aspect honey low pH require good healthy tissue healing , work presence wound fluid , never show produce resistant bacterial strain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy `` MediHoney '' Facilitate Catheter Exit-Site Surgical Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The exit site ( ES ) transcutaneous device , foreign body , skin present site vulnerable term device survival . With large number catheter use chronic dialysis today exit-site care prevention infection critical importance reduce morbidity mortality . Pericatheter infection number one cause catheter loss peritoneal dialysis patient . It appear honey compound multi-factorial mode action . It think honey , antimicrobial action stem high osmolality fact produce continuous non-cytotoxic level hydrogen peroxide due enzymatic break sugar . Honey also low pH conducive bacterial growth good wound healing . Observational report show success heal infected wound , ulcer , protection plastic surgery transplant , burn , herpetic skin lesion , atopic dermatitis . Honey also show antimicrobial action broad spectrum fungi bacteria include antibiotic resistant bacteria . Another study report honey reduces inflammation , edema , promote angiogenesis . In animal study urethral injury show contrary control , total heal restoration normal urethral epithelium connective tissue complete absence fibrosis inflammation . There also narrow lumen see study group . A study prophylactic exit-site care hemodialysis catheter compare honey Mupirocin demonstrate result honey comparable Mupirocin . However , unlike Mupirocin , emergence honey-resistant bacterial strain make attractive alternative agent .</detailed_description>
