	<brief_summary>Intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) traditionally treat surgically emergent laparotomy . Intensivist-performed bedside drainage free intra-peritoneal fluid blood [ percutaneous catheter decompression ( PCD ) ] suggest less-invasive alternative traditional open abdominal decompression ( OAD ) . This study assess relative efficacy PCD vs. OAD reduce elevate intra-abdominal pressure ( IAP ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) , presence elevate intra-abdominal pressure ( IAP ) , abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) , development IAH-induced organ-dysfunction failure , associate significant morbidity mortality appropriate expedient treatment render . Elevated IAP independent predictor mortality critical illness serial IAP measurement increasingly perform intensive care unit ( ICU ) set . Despite grow evidence demonstrate survival benefit serial IAP monitoring abdominal decompression patient IAH / ACS , physicians reluctant consider decompression unable convince surgeon open abdomen patient manifest IAH-related organ failure . Percutaneous catheter drainage ( PCD ) free intra-abdominal fluid , air , abscess , blood suggest several case report small clinical trial less invasive technique reduce IAP potentially correct IAH-induced organ dysfunction . PCD , perform ultrasound compute tomography guidance , describe current World Society Abdominal Compartment Syndrome ( WSACS ) consensus recommendation therapeutic option , insufficient data currently exist support strong evidence-based recommendation percutaneous treatment IAH / ACS ( 10,12 ) . Since 2007 , employ PCD treatment patient IAH due free intraperitoneal fluid blood . This study describe experience less invasive PCD technique compare contemporaneous matched control patient receive traditional open abdominal decompression ( OAD ) treatment IAH / ACS .</detailed_description>
